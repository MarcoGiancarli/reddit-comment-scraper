Air Trick has a few i-frames, DT has different side-rolls and Trick Down, and you could even use Starfall or DT Air Stinger to just get out of the way. For Credo specifically, every melee move can deflect spears. Block them with whatever you think looks coolest, but beware that when you hit them, they go into a spinning state that can still damage you. Sure, Judgement Cut End is stylish sometimes, but just throwing it out there is a good way to end a no damage run. Be a bit more conservative with it's use."

DevilMayCry,3dsp8x,Psykotisk,6,Sun Jul 19 02:14:04 2015 UTC,"Well, the animation is less poppy and responsive overall, devil trigger is too heavily relied upon, the stages are mostly made of giant rectangular buildings with too much space between them... it's just poorly designed in so many ways.  There are slower attacks with less impact (the easing in and out is too smooth with no real sense of force), awkward implementations of new moves like rainstorm and twosome time limit their effectiveness in battle, and the enemies have no interesting defensive or offensive options. Also, you can only fight with one melee moveset with different swords that are either lighter/quicker or heavier/slower.  On top of this, the story is just not very good and the setting is bland (lots of textured cubes trying to be 'buildings'). There aren't many interesting cutscenes, either.  There are some good things that came out of the game, though; The dodge button was fairly smart and became the expanded Trickster style; Lucia and even Trish were the first moment we had additional playable characters; Quick weapon switching was introduced with gun switching.  So, while it's not really worth your time except to understand how bad it is and gain an appreciation for the other games, it left a meaningful impact on the series."
DevilMayCry,3dsp8x,scionicspectre,3,Sun Jul 19 02:28:51 2015 UTC,"It also had the first iteration of Bloody Palace, which is a buggy mess in the HD collection.  Not sure about on the PS2."
DevilMayCry,3dsp8x,ShadowDonut,3,Sun Jul 19 02:54:22 2015 UTC,"Whereas every other game in the series has a really ""snappy"" feel to it, Dante just felt too ""floaty"" in DMC2. The melee attacks were way too slow compared to the first game, and you got ridiculous hangtime in the air. The game really just didn't feel good to play compared to original, and still sticks out compared to every game in the series (including the reboot).  In terms of design, the game had too many aerial enemies in proportion to Dante's moveset. While they did greatly expand on Devil Trigger options, if you didn't have meter then you were pretty much stuck to using guns which is just boring. And it's not just regular enemies; a lot - if not a majority - of bosses were like this.  Quite a bit of the hate also comes down to some of the drama behind the game's development. The short of it is that Capcom went behind the backs of the team behind the original team and gave the sequel to a different team. IIRC, the original team didn't even know there was a sequel until it was publicly announced."
DevilMayCry,3dsp8x,itsachickenwingthing,3,Sun Jul 19 14:55:37 2015 UTC,"In brief: Devil May Cry 2 fails to live up to its predecessor due to the fact that it is not an engaging game to play (A.K.A. is bland and boring as hell). It has nice things too and, if you want to believe it or not, it served as the base for the awesomeness that is DMC3. I made a little listing on my blog, I'll C/P it for you here:  DMC2 got right the following:   Devil Trigger, by far the most powerful form and the Majin form, which is just obscenely disgusting like Vergil on DMC4. Which is good. Acrobatics, both Dante and Lucia are actually very acrobatic when compared to the rest of the games Music, most of the time hard rock/metal of sorts but still blood pumping and actually kind of atmospheric.They rocked hard the guitar on this one. Implementing the base of what would become the Style System through the Amulet mechanic. Lucia, because she’s actually a kind of unique character when compared to Trish or even Lady (even though she shares a similar story with Trish). She could be better tho. Dante’s look. You can’t deny he looks badass on this iteration.   What it got wrong:   Levels are too huge for this kind of game. It becomes tiresome just traversing them. Color choice is bad. Story is all over the place The game feels pointless Sister of the last point, the game does not explain jackshit to the player, and not in the Souls way but the wrong way. Guns are overpowered here and alongside the first point, encourage mindless firearm spamming instead of skill Swords only vary in range, they all feel the exact same. Enemies have a kind of fumb A.I. Game is too easy: dumb enemies + worlds too huge for its own good + overpowered/broken equipment Usage of weapons is just not satisfying to watch or do. Refer to ‘Kill Stick’. Characterization is either just cheesy and not appealing (most used example here is Dante but he may just have been bored. I mean, he has become so powerful that fights are just not fun anymore). At least the rest are either cheesy funny or over the top. Not many incentives to replay besides upgrading rankings The worst sin that ANY game could ever commit: the game is bland and dull. It is not a ‘bad’ game on terms of construction (rather just unpolished) but it is BAD because of how boring it is alongside how of a chore it feels to play eventually. It is important that any game, be nicely or wrongly put up together, has to be fun or infuriating and appeal to the player on the positive or negative way, leaving a lasting impact. Its basically ‘Ow the Edge’ before ‘Shadow the Hedgehog’. But ‘Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry Series’. (and also that last reference is correct with the Dante it comes from. Win?)   But hey, see it this way: just like Sonic 06, if it wasn’t for this game we couldn’t have had the crazyness that is DMC3. And by following, DMC4.  Also, don’t know if this could count as the negative point, but DmC: Devil may Cry shares some things with this game actually… I guess I shouldn’t be surprised :T  Also bonus video :Y"

Bad guy wants to become immortal, in his quest for immortality he places the world in danger. Hero kills the bad guy and then has to leave everyone else behind to kill the evil. -yack-  Dante has NO personality.  Combat is bland, unsatisfying and unengaging. Guns are a little too powerful, combo inputs are poor, acquired weapons are worse than a terrible joke and the enemies (while varied) can't do anything to Dante.  The final piece of the cake is that DMC2 has absolutely NO bearing on the rest of the lore. The events of DMC1,3 and 4 have no consequence by the time DMC2 happens. For all we know, its set 500 years in the future. Capcom has just chosen to ignore DMC2's existence."
DevilMayCry,3dsp8x,KevinLee487,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:19:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say... It's not really sucks, it's just a normal... very easy game.  The story is on okay level. Animations are on decent level as well(acrobatic ones at least, most of dante's combat feels... like you don't even touch the enemy). They made you replay the same game twice before DMC4, which was not the best choise, but at least characters had somehow different bosses and slightly changed levels. The style ratings were also pretty terrible. Enemy designs were rather... generic. And bosses were not unique, just silent demons who we know nothing about. Dante was... pretty damn silent. Which is again, why i reccomend to play it as Lucia only. Oh and it was supposed to finish the story, which is not very nice, and mostly ignored by Capcom now. Oh and the combat was a bit terrible. Considering that each attack threw enemies away. Making them feel like a dolls that you throw against the wall. As for good: Lucia is actually an unique character, with her own story and lore... Which we actually need in the future. The soundtrack is also very damn good. Story was just decent bad guy wants the world, and a bit cliche'ish, but still better than DmC's one, to be honest. OH and, this game introduced weapon switching on fly, which was later used in any other modern DMC game."

That was the one thing about DmC that I really didn't like (and it seemed like 1/2 of the bosses in DmC were like that).    And last, but not least, I'd love to see multiplayer.  Just imagine playing Dante + Trish with your friend, or Nero + Vergil.  Or even Dante + Vergil.  Heck, it'd be even better if you could do a 4 man team and just have massive chaos (though that would probably end up being more like Dynasty Warriors and less DMC)."

When did he die? Did Dante and Vergil ever actually meet him?  If Dante is in the game, make E&I an actual reliable source of damage. They were acceptable in DMC3 if you had Gunslinger and fired them long enough for Rapid Fire to kick in, but they were downright awful in DMC4. For how often Dante uses them in cutscenes, it seems like they shouldn't suck so bad.  Give us some more dark environments. Mallet Castle was EXCELLENT in DMC1. Temen-ni-gru in DMC3 wasn't bad, but Fortuna Castle sucked, the forest sucked, HQ was terrible and the city was only meh.  Bigger visual effects. DMC3 got it right. Shit was flashy, in your face and looked impressive. Just look charge shot in DMC3 and 4. Its downright pathetic in DMC4.  No more rinse and repeat bosses that are entirely repetitive. Heart of Leviathan, Doppleganger, Arkham, Bael/Dagon, Echidna, Sanctus and especially The Savior are just a massive chore to fight. Half of the time you're dealing with some BS mechanic they have instead of actually fighting them.   Cerberus, Agni&Rudra, Nevan(barely), Beowulf, and Berial are all fun boss fights that make you feel like you're fighting this big ass Demon that you have no business fighting but you're going to kick its ass anyway.  Lastly I have to agree with NKLhaxor. More human(ish) sized swordsman. Nelo Angelo, Bolverik, Vergil, Credo and Dante are the best fights of the series. They're fast, intense and challenging. Its always satisfying to shove your sword into some guys neck who thinks hes badass enough to step up. Nelo/Vergil is the only one actually badass enough to step up to Dante.  Edit : A boss fight mode where we can pick bosses to fight against, maybe even a survival selection where it just keeps throwing bosses at you with increasing difficulty until you die. I really hate having to go through some otherwise boring mission to fight an awesome boss at the end (I'm looking at you mission 8,10 from DMC4 and 13 from DMC3)"
DevilMayCry,3ds0fh,Xskills,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:02:32 2015 UTC,"Take place after DMC2 and retcon the apparent ""disney death""/Bolivian army ending by having either Nero or Trish pull Dante out. Take this opportunity to resurrect Virgil. He's more or less the series' Magneto; the fun, empathetic, charasmatic on-again-off-again arch-villain whose agenda isn't necessarily constrained by a moral alignment. Keep what was actually pretty good about DmC: platforming, using triggers to change melee weapons but not toggled; so combos are easier to diversify and prolong. Game: 70% - Dante, Nero - 15%, Trish - 10%, Virgil - 5%, but I expect a ""Virgil's Redemption"" DLC where turns anti-hero while further exploring his relationship with Nero (or what has been lack thereof) Bloody Palace should have specified challenge stages like God of War's Challenge of the Gods latter. This will have the side benefit of teaching players to use some advanced moves. novelty: Character customization. I mean making custom skins for the existing characters; imagine Virgil's shirt and pants but Dante's coat on Nero or Trish wearing Lady's shirt under a light chest rig that looks like a one-piece bikini with blue jeans. Build it in Unreal Engine 4. This engine is great at both realism and artistic styles (I'm looking at you Street Fighter V). The community and support for developing on it is big and will be easier to bug test. Unlike MT Framework, you can viably delegate porting to a platform (if needed) to a western studio. This is why SSFIV on PS4 which was ported by a western studio is so bug ridden (That engine had literally no English documentation) while DMC4SE which was up-ported by the original Japanese dev team is only a quantum improvement to the original DMC4. NO. MORE. LOADING. SCREENS. Experiencing these in DMC4SE is the closest thing I want to herpes flare-up I ever want to feel. These felt inexcusable on the PS4, XB1, and PC by the team who know the game inside-and-out. Finally, it better be 1080p 60fps on consoles dammit."

Not exactly top of the line but I can play DMC4SE at max without any framerate drops and it plays Battlefield 4 on medium-high settings at a smooth rate.  That being said, I'll say it again. Maybe its an issue on consoles but if its the same deal there as I experience on PC, then you're seriously blowing it way out of proportion.  I don't remember loading screens being an issue on Vanilla DMC4 on 360 (then again, I grew up in the 90s. The concept of games without load screens was black magic to me), unless Capcom really screwed the pooch for SE on consoles, I think you're complaining just to complain. You're also overlooking a pretty major fact.   This game was released in 2008. The Special Edition is nothing more than a facelift. It was designed to run on last generation consoles first and then ported to PC. The loading screens it has may have been the best Capcom could do without completely rebuilding the game from the ground up."

But I think you just enjoy DMC4 a lot more than I do so you don't notice things that do or they don't bother you as much. I personally nit pick every flaw it has, especially while frustrated with DMD (The camera and backtracking give me the shits most of all).

DevilMayCry,3dpi5p,Pepperglue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:32:54 2015 UTC,"Okay, from what i've discovered while testing the fight, whichever one jumps in on you first during their ""run away and jump attack in"" sequence, that one will be the one who is in aggressive mode,  and what this means is he'll spend all his time attacking you unless you start focusing on the other one, in which case he'll block and counter.  on normal difficulty it's entirely possible to keep them locked in a one-on-one attack loop by hitting the aggressive one's guard once, royal blocking, then hitting it again.if you miss their guard just hit it again, they block any combos you throw out.  if you want to disarm agni and rudra both for big damage, focus on the passive one and bait him into attack looping in time with the aggressive one's attack (I.E. if agni is the aggressor, hit rudra's guard just before you anticipate agni's attack) they will strike one another and send each other flying free from their bodies, at least I think so.  rudra's attacks are easier to guard because they have less windup, you have to royal guard agni's at the very end, like, just as he's struck you, it's harder to do due to the extended windup, but when you get the timing down it's much easier.  the biggest gripe is i have to keep track of two timings at once, as agni and rudra's attacks are quite different, royal blocking in the air is easy if you do it at the last minute, like, literally near the end of their jump arc.  Feel free to correct me if i'm mistaken about anything, this was just me testing the bosses a bit, took a ton of tries just to get the RG timing down."

DevilMayCry,3dmmab,kampasta,2,Fri Jul 17 20:08:27 2015 UTC,"Nah man, go as royal guard and slap their shit. Stand between them and just do short hops when they attack, most of the time your invulnerability frames negate the attack and they hit each other. When they both run to the far side of the room, their subsequent leap attack can be extremely easily jump guarded. If you double tap guard with the right timing, you can get a double perfect guard on a single hit, and they do this twice. Your rage bar will max out incredibly fast.   I typically double guard the first attack, then perfect guard release the second, which deals massive damage to both. Sometimes I mix in a charged trigger explosion for an even bigger boost.  Even a non royal guard player can do this, as they are the easiest bosses to jump guard in the game.  Fun fact: a fully charged perfect guard release, combined with a full power trigger explosion, is the second highest damage in the game, next to performing ultimate tempest next to a very tall, stationary enemy"

DevilMayCry,3dldxd,Jagrofes,3,Fri Jul 17 05:23:41 2015 UTC,"Learn the visual and audio queues for enemy attacks. Enemies ALWAYS give off signals right before they attack, learning them is absolutely necessary. Also if you haven't noticed, the lock-on reticule actually shows enemy health. It will be a full circle when the enemy is at full health and it reduces down to a small chunk when the enemy is at low health. I want to say it is divided up into 8 sections. Another important piece of information to remember is that ENEMIES CANNOT ATTACK FROM OFF SCREEN. What this means is that an enemy who is off screen cannot initiate an attack. Now if they are on screen, begin to attack and then become off screen from you moving or turning the camera, they are still able to attack you because you were able to see their visual queue. Enemies who are off screen will actively try to get on screen so they can start attacking you.  Watch the Vergil advanced combat tutorial that is posted here on the front page. It gives a little more insight into what you can actually do as Vergil. Just Judgment Cuts alone are a massive difference between a decent Vergil player and a bad one.  DONT STAY IN ONE SPOT! If you're just spamming basic attacks on enemies without going airborne or moving around the battlefield too much, it makes it a lot easier for them to actually attack you. Especially the faster enemies like Blitz and Assault  I'll explain how I deal with each enemy you listed  Blitz - 2 sets of fully upgraded Blistering Swords will take down a Blitz's lightning shield. After that, spam regular summoned swords while going Devil Trigger and doing a full Yamato Combo A. Devil Trigger extends the combo and the final hit does massive damage. Then hit the Blitz with a Heavy Rain Swords to freeze him, rip him to shreds with a few Devil Trigger Rapid Slashes, let Vergil sheath Yamato to detonate the summoned swords and then if necessary, finish him off with a Judgement Cut End or another set of Blistering Swords if he only has 1 chunk of HP left.  Frosts - The basic idea is to separate one of them from the crowd you can focus him down and then repeat the process. Only use Yamato for Rapid Slash abuse or for Rising Star to get them airborne. Frosts are far more difficult to stun over Scarecrows and the like so Force Edge ( for Stinger ) and Beowulf are a must. If they happen to group up in front of you and you have a second, let loose a Drive from Force Edge. The 2nd part of drive will come in horizontally and can hit quite a few enemies. Spiral Swords are also important too.   Mephisto/Faust - Blistering Swords while you rip them apart with Lunar Phase. That combo alone should take away Mephisto's shroud and allow you to kill them. Faust can take a bit more punishment. Another good combo to use is Summoned Swords + Yamato Aerial raves with Just Judgement Cuts thrown in. Aerial Rave B and Judgement Cuts are capable of hitting multiple enemies.  Cutlasses - Trick to them, rapid slash, trick back Rising Star. That will get them out of the ground.  As for the bosses, Sanctus should be the easiest boss you fight. His attacks are extremely predictable and his biggest strength is that he can just run away. Except you just can't run from Vergil. Aerial Rave will take down his shield, then decimate him with a Devil Trigger Yamato Combo A.  As for my credentials - SS'd the entirety of Dante Must Die on DMC3 as Vergil and had a good 150+ hours on my Vergil save. One of the requirements for SSing a Mission in DMC3 is that you take zero damage from enemies (including bosses). I play almost exclusively on Legendary Dark Knight in DMC4 and have been playing the DMC franchise since 2001.  Edit : I didn't put my credentials in to brag, I included them to ensure you that I know what I'm talking about."

DevilMayCry,3dldxd,KevinLee487,2,Fri Jul 17 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"The only difference between DMD and SoS is that enemies do more damage, take more damage and can enter their own Devil Trigger after a while.

DevilMayCry,3dldxd,KirillianAmurawr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:18:43 2015 UTC,"Can say how to deal with Blitzes, If Dante: Grab pandora and jump and shoot at him, it quickly fills the pandora bar(mostly reccomended to use it with jump cancelling, so that you wont get easily hit). Then quickly switch to gunslinger, and activate pandora (aka use Argument move) And quickly fire spread of rockets into the blitz. Works every time for me. As Vergil: Spiral swords. Just activate them around you, and stay near the blitz, while also rapidly shooting at him with swords as well, once his ""shield"" is down, kick his ass with Beowulf, i do that with Jump Cancelled Starfall for that. It does a great amount of damage.  Mephistos and fausts... As Vergil, just actively spam fire, and teleport to them, and attack them with air while continuing to spam teleport button after each 2 hits. Well, easier to show on video. As for Dante, literally jump cancell the fk out of them with a shotgun, again easier to show on video. (sorry for rusty Dante, haven't played with him in a while... Well, since Vergil came out, hue.) As for how to Jump cancel: Literally press jump on enemy, once you reach their body/head. -whoops i am dumb, cutlasses are those flying things, not fishes- As for Cutlass: Just teleport and attack them.

Textures are a lot better than the vanilla pc version, as well as a few animations, the biggest notice are reflections, they're way more dynamic, the glint off scarecrow swords will easily catch your eye. all environments have been tidied and sharpened.  special edition gives you actual costumes, but only a limited number, you have to earn the EX ones via the credit fight sequences, you can earn super costumes via the DMD mode and every character comes equipped with a special costume, it's not much, but given the number of characters, that's no issue.  the story is basically the same, no changes, it's literally just a few extra cutscenes with vergil, one where he goes to fortuna and fights some scarecrows, another where he leaves while making a very powerful statement.  about power  ....because power.  the real draw is this game offers replay value thanks to the new characters, so you'll have a good time if you're into that, LDK mode is also a real bonus as well. combat is just as deep as before, but also comes with a few curious nerfs and design choices, dante's rose glitch is gone, million stabs input is now hold attack then mash the attack button, it's quite tricky. otherwise, that's it. it's not even as good as dmc3 special edition, although is does kinda add a bit more thanks to lady's first ever playable appearance.  is it worth buying a new system? Nah, not really, if it's your only justification then that choice is yours to make as you see fit, but having played vanilla dmc4 I didn't much like it because I never knew about the amazing stuff you could do."

DevilMayCry,3dksjo,ColdVergil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:52:43 2015 UTC,"It depends, if you came from PS3 or 360, then you get more ""new"" things than the PC folks.   Texture resolution are higher (not sure how much higher, since I always played on PC), and some extra eye-candy were given like god rays, more intensive motion blur and depth of field effect. If you can the PC version, you can disable all three. It's mostly small changed. One thing I really like is they made Frost's ice transparent. Also the game supposedly has higher resolution texture compared to PS3 and 360 version. I'll get to that later If you are thinking secret missions being a good indicator of whether characters were ""tacked on,"" then the answer would be yes, as it is obvious that none of the three characters can perform royal guard moves. The only difference I am able to tell currently is there are extra lanterns to grab for the extra characters (sans Trish) to reach some otherwise impossible-to-reach places. Gameplay wise, I think Trish is most ""tacked-on,"" then Lady, then Vergil. But this is just my opinion. the Special Edition includes the textures and the Legendary Dark Knight mode originally from the PC version of DMC4. I think for 25$ may be a hard sell for someone who mastered the original DMC4, but the content is easily worth 20$ in my opinion. Don't buy a console if it only has one game you want to play. But if you really want to, I would suggest importing the Japanese version so you can change language option around to spice things up. The beauty of region-free console."

DevilMayCry,3dksjo,BionicAbeLincoln,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:40:53 2015 UTC,"You choose from three campaigns when you start: Nero/Dante, Vergil, and Lady/Trish.  That means that when picking Vergil you can play through any of the 20 missions you like, and if you pick Lady/Trish then you play through Nero's missions as Lady and Dante's missions as Trish.  Unfortunately this means I still don't have an easy method of getting to fight Credo as Dante, but at least Vergil is a lot of fun to play with.  Oh, and I guess Trish has a hard time getting to fight Credo too, but she's my least favorite playable character so who cares."
DevilMayCry,3dksjo,BionicAbeLincoln,2,Fri Jul 17 20:54:56 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's actually way more implementation than I was expecting. That sounds pretty cool, playing through as Lady and then Trish."
DevilMayCry,3dksjo,lettucent,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:56:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hadn't been expecting that when I bought it, but it doesn't really bother me much.  And I should point out Trish is pretty interesting, I just don't find her as fun as Lady or any of the 3 guys.  Also both of those new campaigns have new starting and ending cutscenes.  I would have enjoyed a short cutscene at the switching point where Lady decides she's going to take a break and tags out with Trish, but oh well.  Other implementation stuff, the only new things in the levels I can recall is that in Fortuna Castle there's a grim grip to help get up to a high up orb cache, though only Lady actually needs it.  And the jump pads in the Savior fight now let you simply run onto them without jumping, which I quite like. Oh, and they finally hid some of the secret missions you can't actually do as other characters (i.e., Vergil won't be asked to use royal guard).  And as somebody who also had played DMC4 but only quite a while back, the only balance changes I've found noticeable:    - Speed upgrade activates a little quicker during fights, and almost instantly out of fights (very awesome)    - The dice minigame moves a fraction of a second slower (I didn't need that, but won't complain)    - Red orbs and proud souls come in enough numbers to buy almost every skill in one normal playthrough (at least when I was getting S and A ranks on average)"
DevilMayCry,3dksjo,KevinLee487,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:39 2015 UTC,"As visuals are concerned, I think this game looks a lot better than the base DMC4, and I had played a decent chunk of it prior to the release, because hype. Everything looks better and more well defined as far as it matters to me. The problem people have with optimization is (I think) largely due to them expecting to be able to play it on the same system/PC they played DMC4 on, which was almost legendary in the optimization. This game is just as good, considering you've upgraded your PC by at least a little. The only difference I personally have is because of the difference in CPU between now and Today.  For the extra characters; I first beat the game as Vergil as that is the type of character I've wanted since DMC3SE. In this case, Vergil has similar moves to DMC3SE, but definitely differs as he has a lot of new stuff we haven't seen yet.   There are new basic combos. He's got a spam attack with yamato that I haven't seen in DmC, no triple dimension cut (to my knowledge, but with 100% focus and devil trigger, a massive dimension cut), sword wave attacks for force edge, spam attacks for every weapon, and charge stuff that I haven't seen yet. The new basic attacks are definitely fun.  Lady and Trish: I'm so horrible at long range play that I can't play Lady correctly. When I do figure it out, it seems to be mashing b and evading. I did Trish for a little bit on the Tower, but I can say that her gimmick (B button?) is rather unique, as it's her unarmed moves, which you apparently combine with Sparda's round trip to finish rooms."
DevilMayCry,3dksjo,kampasta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:29:05 2015 UTC,"How are the visuals compared to the original? - I didn't really notice anything that stood out. It just looks like DMC4 with a little bit of motion blur. I play on PC though with both the original and SE at their highest settings so the difference may be negligible compared to consoles.  Do the extra characters feel tacked-on, or are they fleshed out? - Trish DEFINITELY feels tacked on. Her entire kit is just a frankenstein of Swordmaster style Dante with Rebellion and Gilgamesh and Vergil with Beowulf.  Vergil feels slightly hodgepodged. They replaced his Force Edge combo from DMC3 with an exact clone of Dante's Rebellion combo. He even got Million Stab. Beowulf is also extremely similar to Giglamesh's moveset with Dante (save for Lunar Phase). Vergil's only real unique aspect is his Yamato and Air Trick. Overall, he has a lot of similarities with Dante (the ARE twins after all), but he plays entirely different and he is so much stronger than the other 4 characters that its actually kind of hilarious.  Lady is definitely the newest of the 3. I don't particularly like her, but she's capable of massive damage and impressive displays of destruction. Shes's not a perfect character by any stretch of the imagination, but shes far more complete than Vergil was in DMC3.  How much extra content would you say this edition brings to the table, compared to the original version? -  For those of us who played original DMC4 on PC, the Special Edition does not add any extra content outside of the new characters, a few cutscenes, and a couple of costumes for Dante and Nero. For those of you who only played it on Xbox/PS3, Legendary Dark Knight mode is entirely new as is Turbo mode which speeds the game up by 20%. LDK mode adds a ridiculous number of enemies to every area which just wasn't possible on 360/PS3 due to hardware limitations. Now by a ridiculous number of enemies, I mean a stupid amount more enemies. Instead of fighting 7-8 Scarecrows and 7-8 Gladiuses, you'll fight 20-30 Scarecrows and 20-30 Gladiuses. Instead of fighting 2 Frosts, you'll fight like 12 of them. instead of 3 Mephistos and a Faust, you'll fight 8 Mephistos and 2 Fausts. Instead of 6 Biancos and 2 Angelos, you'll fight 15 Biancos and 4 Angelos. Get the picture yet?"

DevilMayCry,3ditae,deesh8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:09:19 2015 UTC,"Very interesting use of Beowulf there (if jumping is what is breaking his shield). When his shield is down, if you use the Lock On + Back + Shoot Summoned Sword skill, you can Trick to him, fire the swords so he gets knocked up and follow up with a level 3 Beowulf uppercut while he's being knocked up, which feels a bit safer than letting him jump around :)"
DevilMayCry,3ditae,kampasta,3,Thu Jul 16 18:31:47 2015 UTC,"It takes twice as long without spiral swords, but yes, beowulf's jump attack is indeed part of what's breaking the shield. spiral swords+wulf jump basically cuts down the time and makes it easier to break his shields, it's also safer because of the grim trick spam, you can avoid damage 60 percent to 70 percent of the time, so all you have to worry about is getting it down. you can also straight up distorted beowulf lvl 3 upper and knock him out of his shield as well as kill him.  JCE, while costly, is a surefire method of getting his shields down with no risk. normal beowulf jump+grim trick spam alone is only for when you can't afford to spare 1 bar of DT meter on swords, which happens from time to time."

DevilMayCry,3dfc6l,TBAAAGamer1,5,Wed Jul 15 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"opted to do the ""right thing"" by defanging or killing the kid before he became a problem for people   The ""right thing"" would have been to take Yamato back right then and kill Sanctus himself. The Savior would have never been completed and the Hell Gate would have never been activated.    Hence why he was initially after the sword, there was no sense in letting some nameless half-demon who had so much in common with his younger brother have such a powerful weapon.   Firstly, Vergil is the older of the two siblings. Secondly, Nero and Vergil have basically nothing in common. Maybe before Eva was murdered sure, but not now. Vergil simply wants power, consequences be damned. Nero on the other hand just wants to protect those he cares about.   Vergil, unlike his brother, had been a ruthless, merciless killer with nothing to live for except power.   Not entirely true. If Vergil had no mercy, Dante would have died during Mission 7 of DMC3.   Had he made the right decision in killing vergil? what would have happened had he just handed his brother the perfect amulet?    Dante didn't kill Vergil. Vergil voluntarily lept from the waterfall. Unless you mean DMC1 in which case, we don't know if he is dead or not for sure and Dante didn't know it was Vergil until after he was defeated.   it was true that vergil's drive was powerful enough that he actually tried, many times, to kill dante   If Vergil had actually tried to kill Dante, Dante would be dead. No discussion. Its no secret that Vergil was far stronger than Dante in DMC3.   And nero was just defending himself. it had been dante who started their fight to begin with when he pointed his gun at vergil, and it had ultimately been dante's antagonistic nature to vergil during dmc3 that prompted such a need for self defense.   What the hell are you talking about???? Nero was defending himself because Dante attacked Vergil????? Nero attacked Dante in order to defend Kyrie because he miststakingly thought she was in danger. Nero also started their fight at HQ as well. Dante simply put his hand on Nero's shoulder. Nero is the one who immediately tried to punch Dante and then whipped out Yamato and took a swing at Dante.  As far as Dante pointing his gun at Vergil in DMC3, Dante knew damn well that his guns are utterly useless against Vergil. They fought about 1 year prior to DMC3 and Vergil made a complete fucking fool out of Dante. He even got Dante's half of the amulet but decided ""meh"" then gave it back to Dante and told him that he would be able to come back and take the amulet any time he liked. He did exactly that in DMC3. Humiliated Dante for a 2nd time and walked off with the amulet.   It was dante who created this mess, though it could also be argued that he did so with the best of intentions, trying to keep the head of the order from enacting their idiotic plan, it had been dante who came in like a wrecking ball without informing anyone, disrupting a lot of lives and causing trouble for the order, and for nero, who'd been sent to apprehend him.   Dante and the gang were indeed the ones who let the situation escalate to the level that it did, but he surely wasn't attempting to stop the order from enacting their plan. He had plenty of opportunity to do so. Hell, he didn't even have to bother fighting Nero. He could have simply made sure Sanctus was dead in the church but he had nothing better to do so he dicked around with Nero.  Dante wanted to be 100% sure that the Order was up to no good. Trish obviously confirmed it while she was undercover or Dante would have never planted a .45 into Sanctus's face. Also Fortuna was effectively a giant cult. If Dante had strolled in and suddenly told them the organization that heads the religion they devote their lives to is a lie, they wouldn't have believed him so that would have been a waste of time. Hell, the order knew exactly who Dante was before he had ever shown up and they didn't care. The Order should have seen Dante in the same light that Christianity sees Jesus Christ. But no, they just want to shove him into the Savior and forget about him.   after explaining why he needed the sword, nero simply replies ""I need this."" and at that moment, dante realizes he might be repeating the exact same mistake he made with vergil.   I highly doubt it. He wanted to give Nero a chance to save the world. Dante has done it twice by the time DMC4 rolls around. This is supported by the fact that Dante tells him to savor the chance to save the world, and to hurry it up and finish off Sanctus. He let Nero take Yamato so he would have a fighting chance against the Order.  Dante knew that he could put an end to it all at anytime, so screw it. Lets have some fun right?\   I like to think that nero represents what dante believes to be a mistake he made in his youth. he killed and damned the only family he had left over a difference in opinion   Again, Dante didn't kill Vergil in DMC3. I don't know how you came to that conclusion being as we see Vergil alive and well after Dante leaves the demon world. And since you know, Dante fights him 10 years later....  I've been biting my tongue, but I can't anymore and I have to speak up. You consistently post things that make absolutely NO sense. Having an opinion is one thing, but every opinion you have is either based off of utterly false information or is about something which has a considerable amount of evidence to contradict you. I urge you to please replay the games and really pay attention to what is going on. I enjoy having lore discussions and I'm glad that you're passionate enough to regularly post here, but not when I have to constantly correct everything as if I'm the only one who was paying attention.  Please keep in mind that I meant my last paragraph purely as constructive criticism. I do not mean to offend or anger anyone. If you have a theory, have some kind of evidence to back it up. If you don't have that, at least don't try to make a theory which has contradictory evidence."

So that doesn't even make sense. Especially since they say he is departed in one sentence and then vanquished in the next. OR. They could simply be referring to the fact that Dante believed Vergil was dead at that point in time. Dante had no clue Nelo Angelo was Vergil until after his 3rd fight where Vergil's half of the amulet falls to the floor.  Honestly I would just chalk it up to shitty editing on Capcom's part. The games give us absolutely NO definitive proof weather Vergil is dead or simply missing. Given that his final fight as Nelo Angelo ended in the same way that the previous 2, I would lean toward him being missing over dead.  And given all the recent Vergil hype, I'd put money on it that he will be back for the next DMC if there is one.  The important FACT to take from all this is that we don't have any concrete evidence to suggest he is actually dead. Taking a look at the entire picture, theres some possible evidence to suggest Vergil is actually still alive in some form."

DevilMayCry,3da7h6,sagc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:35:31 2015 UTC,"I don't like her. Being unable to cancel all of her stupidly long Kalina Ann animations is a deal breaker.  Also, the handguns don't do enough damage, the Shotgun requires you to be .blank and KA requires you to be 18 miles out because the enemies can close the distance before she gets a shot off.  Its a shame really because her overall damage is straight up insane. If you're allowed to fire off a lv 3 KA rocket.....dear god. Watch the fuck out."
DevilMayCry,3da7h6,KevinLee487,2,Tue Jul 14 18:55:44 2015 UTC,There's a reason firing lvl 3 KA rockets nets you an instant SSS  it's basically Judgment cut end.

DevilMayCry,3da7h6,CountDarth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:53:59 2015 UTC,"well yeah, it kills everything in one hit.  but it's comparable to jce because jce has a charge time in the form of the concentration gauge, heavy damage, but it's far more spammable and mobile, thus the attack is reduced, albeit a little, and your score bonus is negligible."
DevilMayCry,3da7h6,mayonetta,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:21:05 2015 UTC,She's quickly becoming my favorite character in the game. I love the glass cannon style and sheer force of her moves make them extremely satisfying. I will say the rank system is a bit to generous towards her. But I suppose it makes sense since she doesn't have much traditional combo potential.
DevilMayCry,3d7wiw,ColdVergil,10,Tue Jul 14 05:11:49 2015 UTC,"Makes me dream about a Vergil sequel (post DMC1) where he wakes up at the bottom of Hell, without memories and starts off with just his dark slayer and summoned swords. From there he starts crawling his way back and on the way we get to learn more about Sparda's backstory as he gets his memories back. Grabs a couple of Devil Arms due to the resulting demonic civil war from the power vacuum created by Mundus' fall, and somehow get Yamato back once he reaches the top and rip open a way out of the demon world...  But it'll never happen."
DevilMayCry,3d7wiw,ShotgunPanda,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:10:06 2015 UTC,I think it could. I mean there's gotta be a reason on why Capcom is doing such a huge advertising in Japan of Vergil.

DevilMayCry,3d7wiw,Hipster_Jesus,3,Thu Jul 16 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"Some other cool things about Vergil's taunts:  The taunt he has below S rank where he pulls his sword out and sheathes it will hit enemies. His taunts can be cancelled into trick up, but not grim trick. This means that even if you have a summoned sword in the enemy, you will only trick up rather than to the enemy. You can only start up one sword configuration when taunting, the one where Vergil brings his summoned swords closer to his body and sends them out in every direction. But if you already have a different configuration held, you can still use them when taunting (i.e. Holding blistering swords to keep them around you, taunt, you can let go mid animation and they will come out.) After the Harlem Globetrotters taunt you can cancel to whiff a rapid slash under the enemy and still have time to trick to them.   Edit: Just found out you can Just Judgement Cut cancel his taunts as well, if you press taunt and hold attack immediately after, he starts charging his sword without cancelling his taunt. The timing is hard on the Just JC because you have to wait a while before releasing, this works with all of his taunts in and out of DT. You can only do this if you have Yamato out before taunting. You can also use this technique with Force Edge to get a round trip charge without whiffing an attack."

DevilMayCry,3d9o0v,LibrunGems,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"I repeatedly tried to get it on her bare-knuckle moves when Sparda's out and couldn't see any change with the different charge moves (and the uppercut combo-finisher similar to Dante's Real Impact).  Of course, I'm no expert, so feel free to do your own testing or look up some of the pros to see if they say something different. My bet is that she has something but it's just not obvious at this point. It would be best to get a tool-assisted look into the situation."
DevilMayCry,3d9o0v,scionicspectre,-3,Tue Jul 14 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"from what I have seen, and based on previous breakdown videos for dante . . . trish works differently, you can do the distortion in dante's case because real impact actually hits the opponent more than once, whereas Trish's upper cut only hits once . . . I would try to experiment with starting that hit with DT on in her case and switching it off during the hit animation, might do the trick"
DevilMayCry,3d9o0v,Mikolos,4,Tue Jul 14 17:46:27 2015 UTC,"What does any of this have to do with the question? Distortion only effects a single hit, real impact's multiple hits are only noteworthy because you can distort repeatedly and get multiple stacking bonuses, but none of this has anything to do with OP's question.   OP, if you're looking to see if distortion is possible, a multi hit attack has absolutely no relevance. Just do any attack you feel like, and compare damage values. Charge her basic punch all the way, hit a scarecrow in DT, then do the same thing but attempt to distort it. If you get extra damage, you've succeeded."
DevilMayCry,3d9o0v,PM_ME_STAB_WOUNDS,-1,Wed Jul 15 08:29:58 2015 UTC,"yes, however there's a difference between the applying of it, if you use it in dante's 3rd hit animation the damage can be 3 times more of its original amount, and if you use it in the 1st the difference is minimal in comparison which seems to be case in trish's case as she also has only that 1st animation"

DevilMayCry,3d9chc,TheSkinja,11,Tue Jul 14 14:52:42 2015 UTC,At this point I don't think they could really salvage DmC without redoing it entirely. I would honestly prefer they continue DMC instead
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,kampasta,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively new to Devil May Cry in general. I have only played 4 and the Reboot and enjoyed both.  I personally didn't like the lack of lock on in the original release, but that pales in comparison to the terrible camera from 4. That thing would get stuck in the worst places, or be fixed into even worse places. Also everything to do with Nero's plot line was terrible in my opinion.  Why does everyone hate DmC?"
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,Jagrofes,3,Wed Jul 15 11:50:25 2015 UTC,"God yes, the fixed camera angles are a remnant of DMC's origins as a resident evil reboot, and honestly they are one of the worst parts of the game, up there with the resident evil style key fetching and the occasional box pushing puzzle. I also never cared much for Nero, he's kinda whiny.   Personally, DmC is an alright gameplay experience, it's just the characters a lot of people can't stand. New dante's personality reads like a marketing team's transparent attempt to appeal to the 14-21 age range, and his general angst becomes less appealing when it becomes obvious that he likes to put himself in situations just to complain about them. His distrust of humanity and desire to stay away (""trust issues,  that kind of thing"") comes up more than once in the game, yet he lives on an in-use carnival ground, and spends so much time at strip clubs that the strippers know him by name now, which is something you really need to burn a lot of time on to accomplish when you have no money.  Then there's the gameplay. DMC definitely needed a reboot, there are way too many aspects of the gameplay that held the series back. Jumping puzzles, platforming segments, making way too much of my final score based on how many orbs I found in breakable objects instead of combat,  backtracking, etc. A reboot could have eliminated these out of place features, but instead it emphasized them even harder. There are entire levels where combat is optional, and you just do platforming and grapple puzzles. Levels force backtracking by placing blocks that can only be removed with weapons you acquire later on the hand, and boss fights, holy crap they were ruined.  In an effort to make boss fights more cinematic, much of the actual fight was removed from the boss fight. If an unskippable cutscene interrupts my combat, it had damn well better be for a good reason. Oh, the boss just wanted to call me a ""fuckchild""? Yeah, that was probably worth the break in the action.   And last (for me) removal of styles. Sure, if you only ever played sword master in 3 or 4, it isn't so noticeable, but for a die hard royal guard, I really miss being able to block things properly. The weapon parry system is okay, but nothing compared to the old system"
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,kampasta,0,Wed Jul 15 17:28:10 2015 UTC,Did you play definitive edition? Hardcore mode did a lot for the game. Definitely a much better game with that on.
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,Vergilkilla,3,Tue Jul 14 17:57:01 2015 UTC,"It was an improvement, but too little too late. A lot of what was included felt like things that should have existed in the first place (60 fps, vergil can use bloody palace, manual lock, etc) so it felt more like a bugfix patch than a special edition of a game, and I still find almost every character extremely unlikable"
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,kampasta,2,Tue Jul 14 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true as well- these are pieces that should have already been in the game. I was lucky in i never bought the original so my first impression was this improved version, which i set to HC mode at the start. It seemed a much better game that way. Characters still slightly irksome (lame Vergil - super annoying Kat) but that didn't turn me of as hard as it did for some other people."
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,Vergilkilla,2,Tue Jul 14 20:12:50 2015 UTC,"Hardcore mode as default. More good enemies like dreamrunner. More use and playing of Vergil - he was arguably more fun than Dante, mainly because to style with him you had to actually style (though hardcore mode makes it a little harder with Danre, at least). Implementing of style system introduced in dmc3/4 somehow. Return to gothic settings. Bosses MUST not suck. Vergil and Bob were great bossfights... Mundus, suckubus, and baby were all laughably easy and bad. If every bossfight was the quality of Bob it would have been a much better game."
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,Vergilkilla,2,Tue Jul 14 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"don't waste money on ninja theory period, but if you ever got the money and time Capcom for further ruining one of your most well known and genre creating franchises then these should be changed   a proper engine for the game for starers, either they should build one or use a current gen one that they already have in the house of capcom don't put political agendas in the game's story, also don't allow the previous director anywhere near the project  BUILD on the combat system that previous games established, don't give less, remove the 2 dodge buttons lol tie them to combat"

DevilMayCry,3d9chc,ColdVergil,3,Tue Jul 14 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"One of dante's best characteristics was his humanity, I'm not sure how I feel about him feeling MORE human despite not being remotely human, honestly that might be a point in his favor, because by the end of the game he's straight up heroic. old Dante has the excuse of being human by nature, so he was always able to relate to people.  New dante? he builds his humanity, despite not being human, so this might have actually been a point in his favor, because he's pushing through two nonhuman sides just to be able to care and relate to a species he has no reason to care about. Idk..."
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,TBAAAGamer1,0,Tue Jul 14 22:26:33 2015 UTC,"He doesn't build it, he was just raised like a human xD"
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,ColdVergil,2,Tue Jul 14 23:43:22 2015 UTC,"But he wasn't. in DmC he lived in a demon-run orphanage, ran afoul of the law a great number of times and spent half his time fighting for his life in limbo and the other half fighting the authorities in the real world. literally any interactions he's had with people is implied to have been meaningless sex with with random women or fights in riots and nightclubs.  in fact, when the game opens up he's entirely callous to the plight of mankind."
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,TBAAAGamer1,0,Wed Jul 15 00:34:02 2015 UTC,Oh well. Was just assuming that the flashback fights with Vergil were his childhood.
DevilMayCry,3d9chc,ColdVergil,2,Wed Jul 15 00:36:25 2015 UTC,Well there DmC Dante is a teenager. He's self harming because he knows he's different from other humans but he cant pinpoint why. DMC4 Dante is a seasoned demon hunter who's been through a lot of abuse. Also at that point for DMC Dante getting stabbed was a running joke. You're taking the pictures out of context.

DevilMayCry,3d7t81,KevinLee487,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"Fully agree. I never had too much trouble with Dante and Vergil. Nero is not only slow as fuck, but I feel he does far less damage as well. Not to mention that during his Devil Trigger he can still be sent flying, which makes fighting certain enemies a pain in the fucking ass."
DevilMayCry,3d7t81,KevinLee487,5,Tue Jul 14 05:40:12 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive he does more damage than Dante if you keep 100% uptime on Charge Shot 3.  But hes too reliant on the exceed system overall. It's just too valuable. His max-act abilties need to be brought down and his baseline damage needs to go up a tad. He also needs a more reliable way of closing distance.  Dante does the least damage of the 3 outside of DRI (and Vergil's Distorted Uppercut is even stronger), but he has the most variety so he has an answer for every situation and is BY FAR the slipperiest character in the game. He can seriously squeeze his way out of ANY situation. Triple Jump, Double Skystar and infinite dash when in DT? Theres just no fucking hitting the guy if you can manage Trickster.  Vergil on the other hand just cannot be stopped from mauling the face off of every enemy in his vicinity. To top it off, he does roflstomp levels of damage. Buuuut he gets punished extremely harshly for getting hit and even running. He also has absolutely ZERO defensive mobility. Vergil is on 100% offense 100% of the time which doesn't really work on some bosses and you get punished for it. Namely, Echidna, Credo and Berial especially. He completely WRECKS Sanctus, Angelo Agnus and Bael/Dagon. Dante is a toss up. Dante vs Vergil is always an EXTREMELY tense and fast fight this time around. The tide of the fight can change in an instant, not so much the case with Nero."

DevilMayCry,3d3ru2,NeroAngelo257,6,Mon Jul 13 11:06:43 2015 UTC,"If you press DT when your attack lands, the damage will be copied and enhanced as if you did the same attack in DT, leading to more than double damage. Some skills have more than one hit frame though, so you may need to mess around with them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8hx5licmrM"
DevilMayCry,3d3ru2,deesh8,3,Mon Jul 13 12:56:19 2015 UTC,"When dante (and now, vergil) first devil trigger, their movement is not interrupted, and a flash of lightning hits them for a few frames, lighting them up. For the few frames where they're lit light this, any attack that lands will be as if vergil hit them, and then DT vergil hit them a second time. The same bonus can sometimes be applied when leaving DT as well.  Dante's ""real impact"" was famous because with proper timing you could distort up to 6 different hit frames of this one attack, for just over 20x damage. The tech is actually called distorted real impact  A just release is when you're charging beowulf (or gilgamesh) and the exact moment you transition from one charge level to the next, you get the exact same double hit bonus as distortion does. Distorting this will distort both hits. It's crazy damage.   Oh, and the boss freezing is Vergil's rain of swords, which freezes enemies. I didn't actually know it worked on bosses until now, but damn I'll have to start using it"

DevilMayCry,3d3ru2,NeroAngelo257,4,Mon Jul 13 12:28:38 2015 UTC,The enemy stops moving because of the summoned swords rain that you see in the video. That particular move makes them freeze in place.

DevilMayCry,3d28ej,HanHeeHee,2,Mon Jul 13 03:21:19 2015 UTC,"Hello Kevin!  No offence taken, everyone is entitled to their opinion and if anything I am happy that you took the time to read my content.  In regards to revealing plot points it is always difficult to know what to say and what to keep hidden when it comes to remasters. Of course there are those who may be new to DMC or in particular DMC4, and there are also those who have followed the series before. The game was originally released back in 2008 and so I felt it safe to reveal a few points, so my apologies if I may have ruined anything for new players. I do try to keep both new and old players happy!  In regards to Nero and Vergil, the similarities lie in the Yamato blade they both wield (which is Vergil's signature weapon) and Nero's Devil Trigger ability also holds similarities to Vergil's Devil Trigger. They combat however is unique to each.  Dante does indeed have a more demonic form when you activate his Devil Trigger ability. (See attached picture I captured.) I seem to have confused Dark Slayer with Devil Trigger. When I said Son of Sparda I actually meant Sword of Sparda. (I have now corrected.)  On that note thank you for pointing out the spelling mistakes, my apologies for those! All of us here at NGB work regular jobs, myself included, my day to day involves many late hours. Still I pour all my spare time into my passion for games and to bring you quality content. That being said I am only human and we all make mistakes (especially when many late nights have been pursued!) I will strive to make sure extra care is taken at such times in the future!  As for Vergil being mentioned, as far as I can recall Dante mentioned a brother but never actually said his name. This is what I meant by that comment. Those new to DMC may have been unaware of his connections. Sorry for the confusion it may have caused.  To answer your overall question, yes I did indeed play the game and I quite enjoyed it, even though I may be a little helpless when it comes to combos! It was a challenge worth pursuing!  Again I apologise for any confusion I have caused. I hope you can see past the few mistakes and continue to support our content :D  Thank you!

DevilMayCry,3cyj06,ProNanner,3,Sat Jul 11 23:01:10 2015 UTC,"It's amazing- the DualShock 4 is my favorite gamepad on any system. It feels better in every way.  Compared to the PS3 controller, the buttons feel clicky rather than 'mushy' when you push them in, the triggers are a massive improvement with response times and comfort, and the joysticks have finer, more precise control. It's also much more comfortable to hold for long periods of time than the DualShock 3.  It took me two seconds to get used to it and it feels wrong every time I have to play DMC's HD Collection with the old controller. I doubt you'll be disappointed unless you like fatigue and mushiness."
DevilMayCry,3cyj06,scionicspectre,2,Sat Jul 11 23:06:29 2015 UTC,"Also the D-pad is basically a must for advanced dante play. The D-pad on a Playstation controller is 4 separate buttons, because that is a totally sane way to do it. On a 360, they're all connected on the same plastic disk, meaning if you flick fast it's common to accidentally roll the button and get a different style than the one you wanted. I like popping royal guard at the last second, and a 360 controller is absolutely crippling to this play style"
DevilMayCry,3cyj06,kampasta,2,Sun Jul 12 09:13:14 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it, is there any benefit at all to having those buttons connected?

The plastic is thin, the battery is anemic if you're playing wirelessly, the shoulder buttons tend to start sticking after a while, and the rubber wears off the analog sticks really easily.

If you're using the 2015 edition of the XPS 13, you can very probably play DmC: Devil May Cry itself on low settings with decent results. Devil May Cry 4 (perhaps not Special Edition) would run even better. I think you could emulate the previous games with PCSX 2, as well.  If you're running a model that can't handle any of those options, I'm afraid I'm not very well aware of games in this category on PC aside from perhaps the Samurai Warriors and Sengoku Basara games that were ported a while back.

The XPS 13 from 2014 has an HD 4400 and the 2015 version has an HD 5500.  The HD 5500 has been shown to run most games from the last generation, nearing 60 FPS at low settings (720p). As for the HD 4400, here's a video of someone playing DmC with the GPU at around 30 FPS.  There are more similar videos on YouTube; all in all it seems like you can get better visual quality settings and slightly higher resolution than the console versions and retain 30+ FPS. DMC 4: SE performs slightly better, but I find it harder to play under 60 FPS.  If you can run these from an external drive on the newer XPS 13, you'd no doubt get even better performance."

If I need to move while switching styles I'll put my right thumb on the left stick and use my left thumb to switch styles, then return to holding the pad normally. It's pretty much as awkward as it sounds."
DevilMayCry,3crycz,Xolcin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:49:31 2015 UTC,"I use default controls with Dante, and I've found with enough practice, you can get used to taking your thumb off of the control stick to the D-pad to switch styles. You get really fast at it once you're comfortable. Just practice using all the styles separately, understand what you can do with them by themselves, and combine them once you're comfortable. An easy starter combo I do with multiple styles is (midair) Swordmaster > Aerial Rave > Jump Cancel (Enemy Step) > Gunslinger > Rainstorm. Once you get that down, you can switch to something else while holding B for Rainstorm, since you have no need to move."
DevilMayCry,3crycz,itsachickenwingthing,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"For some applications where constant style switching is necessary, such as Air Raves, being locked-on should do a majority of the work. You've just gotta get used to the rhythm that you need to be pressing the style and face buttons. Besides that though, it really just does come to having your reaction times down and drilling the different techniques. Guard Flying is one instance where the Dualshock layout actually works in your favor, as you'll typically want to be flicking the left stick backwards, which is slightly easier to do when your thumb is travelling down-ish from the D-Pad as opposed to up. For the initial connecting attack, the Lock-On trick works.  The other part to it has to do with predicting what enemies are going to do and planning a few combos to counter with. For instance, it's basically impossible to bust out a Just Guard in the middle of a combo because most people don't have the reflexes to switch to Royal Guard and press the style button at the right time. Instead, you switch to RG in advance because you want to focus on guarding and releases for the time being, with perhaps the occasional switch to Trickster to close distances or to GS or SM for extra punishment.  For another thing, unless you're trying to pull off really complex combos, you really shouldn't be switching styles all that much except for going back and forth from Trickster. Planning ahead is really the key for most situations. Anyways, each style change has its own animation for a reason. Oftentimes I'll treat a style change as a pseudo-taunt, just 'cause."

Buy licensed version on steam, and download a repack, pirates fixed all the problems that the game had on PC. As for DMC4, SE one, not ultimate, lol. It's great in optimization, however, if you are a laptop user, beware. They use injected shaders, which FORCE your computer to use intel hd graphics, so you might expect slowdowns. Anyway, both are good. DMC3 SE is the best place to start. However, DMC4's NERO was designed for begginers as well. So it's really up to you where to start."

Otherwise you'll have to tune down overall quality to the lowest level, you can leave textures on super high though. It'll be 90 fps or though. Thats more than enough to run the game on turbo as well. And i see above you asked about DmC, i'd say, play originals first. DmC on PC is a great port as well, it ran stable on my shitty old pc with 2 cores and 3 gigs of RAM. But, getting originals first is the best way to play the game. You can play DmC after you played the originals, because those games are way too different. I mean the original and the (horrible) reboot.  As for disabling Intel HD, i have no idea, i've been trying, but only thing it gave to me, is forced my laptop to use software rendering which was... Well, there is nothing more needed to say."

Depending on your rig and how much time you're willing to put in, there are mods that fix many of the issues. 4 is an alright game with an amazingly deep combat system, so depending on what kind of player you are you might beat it once and never touch it again or use trainers/cheat engine to to explore the combat's depth.   Also, while mouse+keyboard are superior for a lot of games, this genre pretty much requires a gamepad. I use a Dualshock 4, and I know a lot of other players who use Dualshock 3s. Of course 360/Xbone pads will work but I've never played a DMC game with one."
DevilMayCry,3cqp9x,invelios,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:16:02 2015 UTC,"If you are PC only, the only 2 games you can get are DMC3 and the 2 versions of DMC4. Non-SE is pretty much obsolete though, and the port of DMC3 is infamously bad. I heard there are some mods that kinda help but I haven't tried myself. You can probably enjoy 4 without 3. You just probably won't know off the bat who Dante is like anyone that has played the previous games, but that's not too important. The stories in these games are fun, but they are kinda like cheesy action movies, not a lot of deep stuff in them. The main draw is the combat, which IMO is at it's best in DMC4:SE. 3 is definitely harder (and has a much better final boss), but I personally think the combat isn't as fun overall. I've only played the first few missions of DMC1 and 2, but DMC 1 didn't seem to have many cutscenes and the combat didn't seem as refined as the  later ones. 2 felt boring in the first couple of missions, and I've heard most people say it is the worst in the series."

From the first part of the videos, a lot of his ""predictions"" are nothing more than personal opinions. I am not sure how the release of special edition made Dante and Nero ""obsolete"" in any way as he claimed. Both still provides unique play style compared to other characters.  I guess I had a less expectation than he had, because I stay hyped all the way till it's released.  I think he should stay away from DMC for his sake.

DevilMayCry,3coqzp,Bynoe,0,Fri Jul 10 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you, but every time I play Dante now, I feel like I'm handicapping myself.  Vergil does 99% of what Dante does while doing it 500% faster. Its ridiculous how much faster Vergil can navigate the battlefield and how much faster he can kill enemies. The only advantage that Dante has is his defensive mobility and his variety. IMO, Nero is even worse off than Dante because he has even less variety than Vergil, is the least mobile character of the 3 by far and is too dependant on the exceed system."
DevilMayCry,3coqzp,KevinLee487,0,Fri Jul 10 19:06:40 2015 UTC,"If you rank the characters by their power level, then sure, you might consider some of them obsolete in one way or another.  However, I doubt it was ever the intention of Capcom to provide a nicely balanced set of characters. Vergil is a lot stronger than Dante in a lot of scenarios but they still have different options while fighting.   Of course, as Vergil is both easier to use and more powerful, you are in fact handicapping yourself by playing Dante - but to a lot of people DMC has first and foremost always been about providing fast-paced and challenging gameplay, choosing a 'weaker' character does not take away from that experience at all, it actually adds to it.   Also, if we just take a moment to think back to DMC3SE: even back then Vergil was ridiculously strong in comparison to Dante."
DevilMayCry,3coqzp,arterius23,-3,Sat Jul 11 21:25:12 2015 UTC,"While you're not wrong, Dante felt perfectly fine in DMC3.

Well it's rather hard to tell. I think its mission 1 and 2 as well. They are... feeling the most clear i'd say. Most stylized at the way the game should be. Also meeting Berial, heh... badass boss.

Through the painting at the beginning of the mission, it is this self-contained world with so much atmosphere that builds to a crescendo of Vergil's reveal - a pivotal scene for the license to say the least. I also really enjoy the introduction of the Frost demons and obtaining Quicksilver via dragon baseball.  As for other missions , I really appreciate the interactions Dante has with the demon generals throughout the first game. So, I'd have to choose Mission 8 and 15 for the deaths of Phantom and Griffon respectively.  Just to give DMC2 some credit, the finale with The Despair Embodied is very redeeming. I'd personally like to see a true sequel recount that fight as an introduction to new gameplay, and feature a narrative with Dante attempting to escape Hell."
DevilMayCry,3comj3,arterius23,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:25:41 2015 UTC,"my all time favorite mission is mission 2 from DMC4 on LDK, so many punching bags XD"
DevilMayCry,3coflv,Paolomoonman,3,Thu Jul 9 14:15:10 2015 UTC,Mission 12 with Dante is where I practice for years. First room with regular scarecrows. Then into the next room with Mega scarecrows. Then you can go back to the previous room to have more regular Scarecrows spawn :)  Alternative: First 5 missions of BP Berial fight
DevilMayCry,3coflv,BumblebeeCody,2,Thu Jul 9 17:46:35 2015 UTC,"If you've got DMC4, use that and an anti trainer or debug mode, go to Bloody Palace and practice on Frosts or Angelos.   If you only have SE then Mega Scarecrows in Mission 12 are decent for the basics, though they're harder to JC on because you end up quite far from them. See this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYh-qMn6UNo  But generally, Frosts and Angelos are nice for JCing because of large jump cancelling range."
DevilMayCry,3coflv,deesh8,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"Everyone else has already said it, but Mission 12, DMD, give everyone unlimited health with a Trainer, knock a Mega-Scarecrow over, practice landing on Mega-Scarecrow shaped part of the ground and JC'ing happens whether you want it to or not.  JC for days."

DevilMayCry,3clecy,Zalozis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:14:40 2015 UTC,2 words: Holy shit.  And there you go! ''Flying guard'' Vergil.
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,KevinLee487,5,Wed Jul 8 22:23:11 2015 UTC,"As for Yamato I think it was forged(on the wiki says). Let's take the statues where you get a blue orb from DMC 3. I think it was something like Combat Adjudicator and when you hit it with the wrong Sword it'd say something like for when you needed Yamato:""I am the combat adjudicator. Only a dark-forged blade can move me.""  As for Rebellion I think it's some sort of sword blessed by Sparda. Same thing with the statues, it says : ''I am the combat adjudicator. Only a technique imbued with magic essence can move me.''  So Sparda, due to it's name literally meaning Sword, maybe he was able to bless and create Swords. Therefore the name of Densetsu no Makenshi, meaning ""Legendary Demon Swordsman"".  But hey this is just what I believe."
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,ColdVergil,0,Thu Jul 9 00:22:26 2015 UTC,"Considering that we haven't seen even 1 forged Devil Arm in the traditional sense, I doubt Yamato was forged. I believe that it merely references what kind of elemental power the weapon has.  Force Edge is listed as Demon-Forged and we know that the energy it expells is straight demonic energy based off of its color. Similar to how Cerberus has the power of Ice, Beowulf has the power of light and Began has the power of electricity."
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,ColdVergil,2,Thu Jul 9 01:20:42 2015 UTC,Yup that was just what I believe. I sometimes get crazeh with theories XD
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,Monocorno,5,Thu Jul 9 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of Rebellion being a random demon. From a design standpoint the sword clearly represents Dante.     It has a demon skull and a human one, denouncing Dante's hybrid nature. The horned skull ""awakens"" same time as Dante. Why would a random Devil Arm evolve with him?     Now, the Devil Arms lore is weak and I doubt Capcom thought about it for more than 5 minutes,  but what we know is: they are the material manifestation of a demon's Gestalt.  In this sense, I think Rebellion is Dante's Devil Arm. If you killed Dante, I bet Rebellion would be his loot :-P."
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,LockedAndClush,0,Thu Jul 9 03:39:59 2015 UTC,"It has a demon skull and a human one, denouncing Dante's hybrid nature.   That wasnt the case before it transformed with Dante's blood. DAs transforming could have something to do with hybrids awakening their advanced demonic power. Rebellion was just the first DA to pierce Dante while he is near death.   In this sense, I think Rebellion is Dante's Devil Arm. If you killed Dante, I bet Rebellion would be his loot    But its already well established that Rebellion was given to Dante by Sparda, so its been in existence since before Dante's birth."
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,LockedAndClush,4,Thu Jul 9 05:27:22 2015 UTC,"Just because Dante got it from him doesn't mean Rebellion was around before Dante and Vergil were born. We can be fairly sure that Yamato existed before that, because it was used to seal the Hell Gate. There are no such hints for Dante's sword.   Think about it - Rebellion. The name could hint a lot, if you want to speculate. Sparda went against his demon brothers in an act that could be described as nothing short of ""rebellious"", but it's the Sons of Sparda who signify his defiance the most. Maybe Rebellion was created after that to give to Dante, to symbolize his purpose in the world?"
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,Monocorno,-1,Thu Jul 9 06:51:25 2015 UTC,"Just because Dante got it from him doesn't mean Rebellion was around before Dante and Vergil were born.   Unless Sparda killed a powerful demon in the few years before Eva's death, then it has to have been around before their birth.  Since devil arms are the soul of a defeated demon, it simply cannot originate from Dante."
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,Monocorno,3,Thu Jul 9 15:30:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly saying it originated from Dante himself, but perhaps Sparda was somewhat influenced by him in its creation.   We don't really know everything behind the concept of Devil Arms. In the games they come from bosses, but that's probably mostly for gameplay reasons. It's somewhat unreasonable to assume that a powerful demon (like Sparda was, certainly) couldn't just somewhat ""create"" a Devil Arm. He got Sparda/Force Edge from somewhere, and perhaps Rebellion comes from a similar source."
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,Monocorno,-2,Thu Jul 9 15:45:33 2015 UTC,"He got Sparda/Force Edge from somewhere   The best bet is that Mundus created Force Edge for Sparda and its power grew alongside him. I'd also agree  that  Sparda is powerful enough to create a Devil Arm, though we dont know if he has that power.  Fucking Capcom..."
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,Monocorno,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:43:37 2015 UTC,"Since devil arms are the soul of a defeated demon, it simply cannot originate from Dante.   This we can't say for sure. We saw Devil Arms coexist with their demon counterpart (SOS, A&R); demons who were weapons before being demons (Nightmare-β). Nothing impedes Rebellion being made right after Dante's birth.    I mean, do we agree that Rebellion and Dante have a bond?"
DevilMayCry,3cltdv,TBAAAGamer1,-2,Thu Jul 9 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"This you can't assert with certain.   We have no contradicting evidence against my theory. A&R were the swords. They simply had a demon wield them so they're ruled out.    ""The Nightmare-β modeled after Nightmare that was formed in the Underworld.""  So thats not even the Nightmare demon.  Dante definitely has some sort of connection to Rebellion."

You can't continue both DMC and DmC at the same time and the fans have spoken. DmC flopped.

Personally, I think DmC was a good game - just not a good Devil May Cry game. Sure, dialogues pretty much came down to sexual innuendos at best and mindless swearing at worst but the gameplay itself was enjoyable for me.   The problem for DmC though is that Capcom expected a lot more in terms of sales, so they probably won't really consider giving it a sequel. Furthermore, Ninja Theory is busy with their own project, so even if Capcom wanted them to do DmC2, they currently don't have the time to do it."

One good thing it did was not reusing levels for half the game like DMC4 did.  I'm playing the special edition, for Vergil of course, and it's just lazy game design that you spend the second half of the game running back through every single level you already went through.  At least DmC didn't turn the second half of the game into one big backtracking session.  Also, I liked the music for DmC, techno and heavy metal, Hail Sparda! :P  Yea, there's things on which DmC missed the mark, but given a sequel, I'd think they'd be able to refine the combat system to something closer to DMC4 and maybe give Vergil a bigger playable section of the game instead of just a couple levels as fan service DLC."

DevilMayCry,3cd67y,xirog,8,Tue Jul 7 00:07:10 2015 UTC,"I really don't think a Devil May Cry game without Dante as a playable character can be a real Devil May Cry game. Now don't get me wrong, I like Nero but without Dante it is simply not the same deal for me. One of the greatest reason I love this series is because of Dante as a character. And I believe they can easily make a game that occurs between 1-4 or 3-1 or 4-2. We don't need to go past 2. Hell, even they can retcon the 2 and make a game that pasts after 2 but with a Dante more like the DMC4 Dante but a bit older.   Now don't get me wrong of course I'd like to see Nero return but I want him to be a small part of the game. Just like Dante was to DMC4. 6 or so missions for him would be enough. Or even they can just add a devil arm or a style that can replace the ""devil bringer"" to Dante and make Nero as a optional playable character. Which would be the best option imo.  EDIT : Also, with the ""devil bringer"" alternative for Dante solution we will have room for other potential playable characters such as Vergil, Lady and Trish. Vergil has his tricks. Lady has her kalina-ann rope. And Trish can use the Sparda sword as a ""devil bringer"" alternative. For Dante I'm not quite sure what would be a ""devil bringer"" alternative but an easy but unoriginal solution could be the ""trickster"" style."
DevilMayCry,3cd67y,HopelessChip35,7,Tue Jul 7 01:09:44 2015 UTC,"Oh no, i didn't mean Dante shouldn't be a playable character (or any of the others) when i said he had dried off! If there's something i really want, is more Dante and more Devil Arms for him to be stylish with!  What i meant is that, in my perspective, Nero will be the focus from now on. The story will revolve more and more around him, but Dante will damn right be important, just not the one in the spotlight.  Just like DMC4 :p  Although i really wish Dante had more missions in 4. Should have been 50/50 in my opinion."
DevilMayCry,3cd67y,HopelessChip35,3,Tue Jul 7 01:22:55 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed. Sorry, it appears I misunderstood your original text btw."
DevilMayCry,3cd67y,ColdVergil,2,Tue Jul 7 01:32:34 2015 UTC,"No problem, it happens! :)"
DevilMayCry,3cd67y,ColdVergil,5,Tue Jul 7 02:13:26 2015 UTC,"Hmmm not gonna agree on the Vergil part.  On the manga Vergil defeated Dante in just a blow, he was not trying to kill him neither defeating him. He took the amulet but just as fun he gave it back to Dante. Vergil states since the pretty beginning of it that he wants to go to hell, not as much people believe that he wanted to attack the human world. Yes he couldn't care less about Arkham plans but he knew that it wasn't important and if anything would show up he would just defeat him.  Now Vergil was impaled by demons at the age of 8 which made him awake his DT. This was very close for when Eva was killed. Thanks to this, it made him really cold. The reason he wanted more power was to avenge those fallen ergo Eva. In DMC 3 there's a line if I recall Vergil saying to Dante that might controls everything and without strength you cannot protect anything let alone yourself. This was a clear reference to when Eva was killed and he couldn't do anything to save her.   To seek that revenge, I imagine Vergil wanted to defeat the true entity behind this that was Mundus, which is obvious since he says he is going to hell.    Now here's where my crazy theory enters. Now with DMC 4 SE we know that Vergil was in Fortuna before. I believe that Vergil thought through everything. He goes to Fortuna, he already had in mind this whole plot to defeat Mundus BUT he takes precaution in case he is defeated. He impregnates a woman in order to leave his legacy and in hope for Dante to find someday. This may be quoted on the new cutscene which states ''Soon they shall know this devil's power'' maybe refering to Nero. So then the whole DMC 3 happens and since Vergil already knew that impaling people awakes their DT, he impales Dante in 3. The thing is that he really wanted Dante to awake his DT and perhaps join him on the quest to defeat Mundus but since Dante showed less than interested in about it, he then refuses Dante's help at the end. He never underestimated Dante, he knew that his twin brother would probably have identical power so why indeed he impales him. I believe it's the opposite, he makes Dante awake his DT in order to give him more power.   I don't want you to believe that his quest for more power was meaningless.  Pride and arrogance are part of him, not in a bad way, this is just to keep him stronger. Of course he goes and admires his demon side. The impact of having your mom killed at the very age of 8 is incredible, not being able to save her and beeing powerless to do so it's really heart breaking. I can confirm this because incredibly enough my father died when I was 8. So I can totally relate. The guy feels incredibly frustrated, he as a human sees himself as he is not powerful enough to protect those who he loves and starts a quest to gain more power.   Now he failed on his quest. Here's where my other crazy ass theory begins. Defeated by Mundus, he sadly was now under his control. Then Dante defeats him 3 times. But notice each time Dante defeats him, he sort of vanishes. So I still believe that he is alive. He somehow managed to get inside of Nero since Nero says that a voice inside of him is claiming for more power, give me more power. After Dante defeated Mundus, he probably gained control over himself but surely was out of power. My guess is that he remembered he had a son in Fortuna and headed back maybe in that blue purple spirit form. In that attack when Nero gets injured, he took the chance. Then when Nero is close to Yamato, Vergil awakes and kinda helps Nero to get it back and restore it.  I believe that if DMC 5 goes, Vergil is gonna step out of Nero. He either is going to be bad or neutral. Maybe a character like Vegeta. I hope for a new more powerful villain in which it will require Nero, Dante and Vergil to fight as a team. It would be seriously awesome to see those 3 go JACKPOT!"
DevilMayCry,3cd67y,ColdVergil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:23:47 2015 UTC,"Was waiting for you to comment!  I read DMC4's novel thanks to you, but i never read 3's, so what you told me there is complete news to me.  When i said he was proud and arrogant, i didn't really mean those were bad things, they indeed made him stronger. Although i think the game directors really go a bit far with the ""human"" and ""love"" making Dante stronger, i like to think Dante surpassed Vergil anyway by the end of 3.  And well, now knowing what you've just teached me, i'm going to take your theories full cannon! Vergil purposely awakening Dante's DT makes a lot of sense, even more if it's in hopes that Dante will join him. This also makes me think of one of his line in mission 7, ""Why do you refuse to gain power?"", it's almost as if Vergil really wants Dante to join him, anyway.  And yeah, the fact Nero heard Vergil's voice really makes me think of your theory of Vergil somehow managing to get inside Nero very plausible. Reminds me of Kingdom Hearts, in which one of the main protagonists ""die"", but he manages to go inside another protagonist and actually ""live"" inside his heart while his own heart recovers. I really agree with you on Vergil coming out of Nero somehow, it's something i had already imagined when i wrote this post.  I also imagined him being bad or neutral like Vegeta.  And a 3-man Jackpot? Jesus, i need DMC5."

The point where he says that he will become a demon endure exile to protect her, with the voice seeking for power in his head and the yamato in his right arm.  Vergil needed power to protect eva and Nero to protect kyrie. Also you see how yamato vanished? Couldn't it be that vergils soul or a part of his soul remained in the sword and uppon coming in contact with neros devil bringer he vanished inside him? Or maybe a part of vergils soul was allready in him(would explain the voice in him seeking for power) and with yamato holding the rest of vergils souls it combined again when nero got yamato. Maybe yamato could only be restored because of vergils soul  edit: but ofcourse it can be all because of the blood of sparda, but that would mean he most likely vergils son, and since sanctus didnt know it himself he cant be an experiment, since then they wouldn't need the trouble of catching dante to use him for the savior"

DevilMayCry,3cd67y,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:55:42 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with Nero becoming uber powerful. If it was possible to turn more demonic, Vergil would have figured out how.  Nero is only 1/4 demon and it took a personal weapon of the most powerful demon to ever exist to even awaken his sleeping powers. Without Yamato, he is pretty weak.   Instead, I think DMC5 should be about both Vergil and Nero or just Vergil. Instead of going balls deep into this brand new character, how about we learn more about one of the originals who has played close to as big a role in the overall story as Dante?  Have Vergil return, take Yamato and kill Mundus once and for all. For Nero's segment of the story, have him be forced to be able to manifest his demonic power without using Yamato as a crutch. He's never going to get stronger while relying so heavily on it. He has to grow on his own just like Dante did.  Dante has the Sparda sword but it just hangs on his wall. He didn't rely on it past the point where he absolutely needed it. Nero needed Yamato in DMC4, I think its about time that it returns to its true owner."
DevilMayCry,3cd67y,KevinLee487,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:06:18 2015 UTC,"Not talking about becoming uber powerful, but more powerful than Dante at least. (Well, i guess that is uber powerful, though)  And about Nero growing on his own and stopping being so reliant on Yamato (even though i disagree with you that he's weak without it), i think that would actually be pretty obvious/mandatory.   Oh, and   If it was possible to turn more demonic, Vergil would have figured out how.   It's not like everything about it is written in books for Vergil to learn. If we follow your logic, he should have found out how his human part is important before Dante did, right?"
DevilMayCry,3cd67y,KevinLee487,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"I still say that Vergil is more powerful than Dante. He lost because of plot armor.   How is Dante going to lose so bad that Vergil could have killed him without breaking a sweat and then still somehow be able to soundly defeat Vergil just a few hours later? Dante took far more of a beating that day than Vergil did as evidenced by Beowulf. He caves Dante into the floor yet Vergil instakills his ass. Its bullshit.  And Vergil clearly learned plenty of demonic things on his own. Something as big as becoming more demonic should be pretty easy to find considering what he did find out.  Its clearly possible to gain demonic power as a human since the Order of the Sword did it, but I doubt its possible for someone who already carries Sparda's blood. That shit has to be stupidly potent. Just look at Nero's basic abilities and that's only with 25% demon blood.   Honestly, I think Dante is at his peak. He's probably at the same level Sparda was after sealing the bulk of his powers inside Force Edge. Vergil on the other hand embraces his demonic powers and makes it his goal to be the very best he can be. It's all about that motivation."
DevilMayCry,3cd67y,KevinLee487,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:38:02 2015 UTC,"Well if we're gonna tall about that, then i have to say that i agree with you, Vergil is waaaaaay stronger, and he lost because of plot armor indeed. Thing is, it still is plot and it can't be ignored when talking about... Plot.   And ah well, we have different opinions on Vergil's intelligence, but that happens. I just personally don't think he's all that smart, just disciplined, he can't know everything imo."

But I feel like its implied that he knows enough about demonic powers to figure out how to turn himself further into a demon if possible. I mean he learned about Temen-ni-gru, the perfect amulet, summoned swords and the Dark Slayer style at the very least just by wandering around and reading everything he could about demons and Sparda.  Hell, he even knew exactly who Mundus was just by seeing his 3 glowing orbs at the end of DMC3. Dante didn't even know Mundus existed until a decade later."
DevilMayCry,3cd67y,KevinLee487,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:00:35 2015 UTC,"well, for starters dante found more weapons than vergil, defeated more uber powerful demons, and collected more blue orbs. also, he parties harder, vergil couldn't even keep a babe at HIS bash."
DevilMayCry,3cd67y,Regalian,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"well, for starters dante found more weapons than vergil   The weapons Dante found are a joke compared to the likes of Yamato which has shown to the most powerful weapon in DMC save for Sparda's own sword. Why do we never see Dante use anything other than Rebellion against Yamato? Yet Vergil was perfectly fine with using Beowulf(though he switched back to Yamato some time during the fight which implies that random Devil Arms just don't hold up to Sparda's weapons) or Force Edge against Dante. Its arguable that Yamato would simply cut any weapon that Dante has to pieces save for Rebellion and Sparda as Rebellion is the only thing we've seen that was able to fully block Yamato. It even effortlessly pierced the Devil Bringer. Something which even Rebellion wasn't capable of.   defeated more uber powerful demons   Dante has only defeated ONE truly powerful demon which was Mundus and he had to use the Sparda to even stand a chance.  The only actual comparisons we have for enemies defeated between the two is a Hell Vanguard which Vergil casually killed in a single blow (while it was unarmed, weakened and not attacking) and Beowulf who pounded Dante into the ground hard enough to make a crater and was seriously injured when he ""fought"" Vergil who again, killed his enemy in a single strike. So its a piss poor comparison to begin with.  Now, as weve seen Vergil is unquestionably a better swordsman between the two, is much faster than Dante and his demonic powers are more developed. Vergil's powerset and technique is MUCH more suited to a 1 on 1 with another melee combatant compared to Dante's more broad set of weapons and abilities.  Afterall, Dante is in the demon slaying business. Vergil is in the killing anything that gets in his way before it can react business.  Lastly, that babe was an uninvited guest."

Damn, as i read this, the cutscene at the beginning of DMC4 in which Dante first strikes Nero and he easily blocks it with the Devil Bringer instantly crossed my mind along with Yamato cutting through it like butter. Interesting comparison there.  Well, while i do agree Vergil is stronger than Dante if you throw away all the plot armor, you can check Vergil's and Dante's to-do list if you want to consider plot.  DANTE'S TO DO LIST: Kill Mundus ☑  VERGIL'S TO DO LIST: Kill Mundus ☐"

DevilMayCry,3cc44b,TBAAAGamer1,2,Tue Jul 7 02:43:05 2015 UTC,"With the exception of Nevan and Lucifer, both fairly unique, Dante's arsenal revolvers around swords and gauntlets/martial arts (i.e. Cerberus).   With that, I saw still images of Beowulf animations in a preview article of DMC3 from PSM. Without a full context of styles, I was under the impression of robust martial arts featured as a style. What we got was Royal Guard.   So I would like to more martial arts that depart from the Ifrit fundamentals. However, the addition of the Spinning Bird Kick(Chun Li) to Trish's bare-handed move-set, I fear that Capcom would be too inclined to Street Fighter-esque martial arts.  To be frank, I would much rather see a departure from the curated Itsuno-directed combat whose top tier play revolves around twitch-based jump-canceling. What comes to mind personally is a concept that dispenses with health bars and mass damage for both Dante and enemies and instead sees a tactical consideration for dismemberment and immobilization - again, for both Dante and enemies. The skill incentive is geared towards building momentum and flow(i.e. maintaining light feet while cleaving through crowds flawlessly to gain prehensile actions, like double jumps, enemy steps, etc.)  I doubt that this concept is something that represents ""Devil May Cry"" to the community, and should probably be packaged with a new IP."

DevilMayCry,3cagoh,Slothman899,7,Mon Jul 6 11:09:40 2015 UTC,"One of the main complaints of DMC4 from DMC3 vets were how easy it was compared to DMC3. IIRC DMC3's original difficulty was too hard to beat (US version) and they had to change that to make it playable.   If you die more than 3 times, DMC3 will unlock an easy mode, switch to that and then once you have your character upgraded you'll have a better chance.   Also, keep moving, never stay still, they'll fuck you up! I've had to do re-do so many no-damage runs because of that.   The rest is simple, learn the enemy patterns, take out long range enemies first (shit that shoots projectiles at you and what not!)  There isn't an easy way to play DMC3, you just have to get better :D it's frustrating as fuck at the start, but you'll get better.  I had 800+ hours in DMC4 and when I picked up DMC3 I got destroyed."

DevilMayCry,3ca9ld,Zoiide,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:00:09 2015 UTC,I think Nero would be a perfect character to have his main weapon be a set of dual wielded swords.  He already uses Red Queen entirely left handed and never uses both of his hands for Yamato.  Maybe have him able to manifest a summoned sword with his Devil Bringer as his off-hand weapon.  It would really help differentiate him even further from Dante and signify that his demonic powers are increasing.

It always infuriated me that Capcom introduced an entirely new character before giving Vergil some more story past ""MOAR POWER ARRRR IM A BOSS FIGHT"""
DevilMayCry,3ca3s0,ColdVergil,2,Mon Jul 6 17:20:46 2015 UTC,"Vergil focused game, VERGIL NEEDS A GAME, not as the second one like always. Or Sparda one. Maybe keep Dante again as the protagonist and make him finally shine full power. Play as extra something like Devil's origins where you play as Sparda mini story.  Explain Nero origins. Complete story with no missing info. Just teasing if DMC 6 is going. DMC 3 Difficulty. Mutiple single player campaigns. It'd be cool to play the game from different perspectives. Nero's full DT. 20 fucking missions with just one character. I hated how you needed to wait 12 missions to play Dante. More info on how Sparda defeated Mundus, like actually showing Sparda gameplay and see why the hell he was the LDK. More info on her mother aswell. Co-op. Itsuno has said that he always wanted to put co-op in it and that's why we had that glitch on DMC 3 in which we could plug in another controller and play as the doppelganger/Vergil. Besides we saw now in the ending of Lady/Trish how they were killing demons in the same area. But this should have it's own campaing, not affecting the single player story. Saying that this genre is not the genre for co-op is silly. Co-op hack & slash is amazingly fun, Castle Crashers, Dynasty Warriors, Diablo, Torchlight 2, they show some good and strong co-op. I mean for a reason Itsuno has wanted to implement it since DMC 3. Fucking well designed enemies and not some lame Scarecrows. A new final boss more powerful than Mundus, which will take Nero/Dante/Vergil to finish him. I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT 3-WAY JACKPOT. Bloodypalace like DMC 3. At least 5 costumes for each character. That they don't get inspired by anything of DmC. Leaderboards! More customization, like actions. So you can set the actions to another input. Having DMC'S 3-4 Dante styles. You could choose what 4 styles to use in battle. So you'd choose between 7, you could have special slots for each mission. And why not add more? Tons of artwork. I love that shit. No more map reciclation nor backtracking. Pain in the ass. There's no need to say about new weapons since Dante always gets them but i'd love to see older weapons to return. Agni & Rudra/Nevan mostly.   Capcom has a huge chance of creating a masterpiece if they play their cards right.  EDIT:    Explain how Dante escapes hell after DMC 1. Different DT transformations with different weapons."

But his buster arm, however, does resemble Sparda's demon arm. It would make sense he's less than half demon, and Sparda has only two kids...

Hence, Vergil, although his physical form is destroyed on Mallet Island, is at least a contributing presence in Nero's ""mutation"". The relationship reminds me of Jin Kazama's ""devil gene"" branding in the forest in Tekken 3.  Classically, demons are immortal spawn and can only be banished through various means from the material plane. However, theory is practically immaterial to the severe lack of care, or even consideration that has been given to the Devil May Cry lore on behalf of Capcom's staff and PR.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM2ai72jTIQ  The descriptions that Hideaki Itsuno and Yuji Shimomura give of the five protagonists in the above video just seem so...basic!

Due to some intense training or a heavy fight nero awakened and his arm changed, Credo kept it to himself cuz he grew to love(no homo) nero. And you know the rest of the story, as it is DMC4's plot"
DevilMayCry,3c9zx2,ColdVergil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:40:07 2015 UTC,How do you explain this in relation to Vergil's arival in Fortuna decades before the events of DMC4?

DevilMayCry,3c9zx2,5chneemensch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:45:09 2015 UTC,"Dante is in his early 30s in DMC4, nero is what 18? DMC3 dante was in his late teens, and the trip to fortuna happened b4 DMC3, but by not much just based on his looks. So basically with added impregnation time nero took 19 years, let's say dante was 18 so vergil was that old too, it means that dante should be 37, which is over even mid 30s, which rules out that vergil could be the father.  And this has been the argument for the past 7 years why vergil can't be the daddy, and I would prefer it if he wasn't either, and my theory makes enuff sense for me tbh.   Why would nero hear according to himsel an ECHO inside his head? ""POWER. GIVE ME MORE POWER!"" how do you explain that? Vergil is either inside him, or is whispering to him from heaven which doesn't exist in DMC's universe, which leaves that vergil was inside him from the start of his creation."

Just because they look like age xx doesn't make them age xx, not even counting a potential increased and/or decreased growth speed/aging process. Just because human pregnancy lasts 9 months, does not necessarily make demon pregnancy last as long. Just because humans can mate at the average age of 13 does not necessarily mean that demons can't mate from day one (or mate at all in the traditional way).

In Vergil's opening, it says ""Fortuna City, a few decades ago"" which implies it was at a bare minimum, 20 years prior to DMC4.   As of DMC3, Dante is at bare minimum 18 since he owns property and a business. 18+20= 38 given that Vergil's arrival in Fortuna couldn't have been very long at all prior to DMC3 based off of Vergil's appearance."

DevilMayCry,3c7kqe,no1darker,2,Sun Jul 5 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"I've found that if you just jump around on berial's body you can dodge them all whilst not loosing distance or concentration.  Of course you need enemy step to do this, but it's made a lot easier by Vergil's Trick ability."
DevilMayCry,3c7kqe,Perplexed_Comment,2,Sun Jul 5 19:48:11 2015 UTC,"You can't dodge his pillars, you have to outrun them, but most people are airborne and striking his horns and face when he casts pillars, and his nuke has stagger properties, so you should DT to escape. DT is more or less enhanced damage and mobility anyway, so it's worth the bar."
DevilMayCry,3c7kqe,TBAAAGamer1,3,Sun Jul 5 20:02:43 2015 UTC,Trick Up has enough iframes to avoid the pillars if timed properly. I've been told that the same thing applies to his explosion but that's either not true or the timing is exceedingly tight
DevilMayCry,3c7kqe,PvtCb,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:07:12 2015 UTC,You have to get away as fast as you can with ground trick.
DevilMayCry,3c7kqe,TBAAAGamer1,2,Sun Jul 5 20:05:49 2015 UTC,"Make sure you have max concentration before the fight, and some DT. Start with Force Edge. Trick to him, Helm Breaker, swap to Beowulf and do a level 3 charge uppercut. You can do Heavy Rain swords if you're worried he'll hit you but you should be fine. Distort the level 3 charge attack (you should be able to distort both hits with proper timing), then when he's on the ground, just do level 3 distorted charge attacks - his fires will be extinguished and he'll be knocked down.  However, if you want to do it 'properly' as Vergil, just use Trick to dodge whenever he attacks, when he uses the fire pillars and explosion just use DT Trick to dodge."

DevilMayCry,3c7kqe,NeonCircus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"To be honest I still don't really understand what causes Berial to use his explosion.   It had been a long time since I last played DMC4 when I picked up the SE, I thought I remembered him only using the explosion when his flames were extinguished, in order to reignite them - but ever since picking up SE he seems to be throwing them out as he pleases during pretty much every stage of the battle."

DevilMayCry,3c8mvk,Slothman899,2,Sun Jul 5 22:46:59 2015 UTC,"First, the enemy step varies on character. It's easier with Nero, it's harder with Dante since Dante's hitbox for it is pretty small. I still struggle so much with Dante.  Second, you have to time it right and not smash the buttons like crazy.  Third, it also depends on what attack are you trying to cancel. The easiest one for me it's Dante's Pandora in air. Just jump, shoot with the machine gun and jump out of it.  If you use your double jump instead, it means that you were not fast enough to cancel the attack. Enemies hitbox for enemy step is usually above them."

I used to post videos, and I used to post all the time on phantombabies.net. I even submitted videos for an online tournament called ""true style tournament"", with some insane jump cancelling and summon swords from vergil and insane swordmaster jump cancelling from Dante.   But in 2015, i am surprised there is still people playing this game. I recently started looking at devil may cry related stuff because I heard a DMC4 special edition was coming, which I am absolutely flabergasted by. I mean, releasing a special edition SEVEN years later? An SE is something you aim for maybe 2 years after the original release, not SEVEN. Capcom is literally half a decade late into putting this content out.   But anyways, it's a freaking single player, hack  and slash game that hasn't been relevant for nearly a decade, and I am just surprised there are people still actively playing the game."

DevilMayCry,3c0qsb,CuhrazeeDevil,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:49:16 2015 UTC,You need to use a melee attack during the pause when he's charging his final stab.
DevilMayCry,3c0qsb,krynnmeridia,4,Fri Jul 3 20:32:33 2015 UTC,Didn't know you could do that but alternatively you can dodge his last stab (trying to leave yourself near where he will end up) and melee him afterwards.

DevilMayCry,3c0qsb,CuhrazeeDevil,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:10:26 2015 UTC,"I personally got a bad ranking by spamming Holy Waters to do all my damage.  I wonder if the fact there are no orbs to find on this stage has anything to do with how easy it is to not get a B or lower unless you try. If the S you always get for orb finding counts on this mission that might be making it harder to get a low ranking. Especially since it is not that hard to beat sanctus fast, and it's annoying to not beat him fast."
DevilMayCry,3c0qsb,invelios,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:54:46 2015 UTC,percisely why it's hard to get low rank. No orb to find and most of the time you'll kill him with A or S rank in time too. Which means that you already have 2 S or an A and an S before even beating him xD
DevilMayCry,3c34gj,Account256,3,Sat Jul 4 08:26:30 2015 UTC,"so basically what i'm saying here is, if you're reviewing, don't just throw a point out and repeat it several times, you're a critic, dig into the meat of what you're talking about, explain what worked and what didn't, don't just say ""It was interesting, therefore it was interesting."" that's redundant and makes me sad."
DevilMayCry,3c34gj,TBAAAGamer1,2,Sat Jul 4 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"Your review is too vague and your points are too vague. you basically say the story is good because it's bat shit insane and then you don't go too far in expanding upon that point, you just say it's interesting, you never explain what exactly it is that was so interesting. then you move on to explain how this made kickass boss fights, which can't be true because most of the bosses in this game were terrible, save for bob barbas, who was a blast, vergil mission 20, who would have been better had it not been for those constant interruptions, and hollow vergil, who is the poster boy for devil may cry's hardest hell or hell boss ever."
DevilMayCry,3c34gj,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:54:13 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the criticism and I agree I was a bit too vague about the story but I didn't really have much to say because it wasn't much. As for how I said it made for kickass boss fights, you say that it can't be true because most of the bosses are terrible, and I disagree that I was incorrect because it is based on opinion. You may have disliked them but I enjoyed them. Different people like different shit man.  EDIT: I just fleshed out the story more in my review."
DevilMayCry,3c34gj,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:13:09 2015 UTC,"whenever I criticize something, the foundation I usually do it from is ""what were the devs trying to accomplish when they created the game and what works for this?"" as such when I fought those bosses i found that almost none of them actually contributed to the gameplay in any meaningful sense save for the two vergil fights. among the worst of them was poison the succubus, which simply wasn't fun and didn't take much, if any effort to defeat, and mundus, which was fundamentally a clone of the poison fight with a different pacing and damage output. the reason bob worked as well as he did was because of his presentation along with the buildup to the fight, he also had the right level of ham you'd expect in a devil may cry spinoff like DmC. vergil, despite not being the best boss presentation wise, had the best gameplay and was a modest and challenging fight.  It's not a matter of liking or disliking, I had to figure out what was contributing to what the game was trying to accomplish, and what it was trying to accomplish was ""it's trying to be a more accessible devil may cry"" and with that came the understanding that there was a necessary balance between presentation and gameplay mechanics that had to be given and a lot of bosses didn't quite do that, even the hunter, despite being a neat fight, was just too easy thanks to his moments of easy stun meant to balance out his insane health pool. a lot of the bosses had ridiculously easy to place telegraphing too, like, too easy, they had a windup that was far too long and far too easy to figure out. accessible telegraphing could have been done better and in truth, actually was during the vergil and bob fights. a lot of other bosses only had 1-2 attacks that they just spammed over and over or attacks that didn't really do anything. poison's spike summon could have transformed her fight by tracking dante, but instead the spikes just kinda rise in random places and don't do anything."
DevilMayCry,3c34gj,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:25:46 2015 UTC,"I personally felt the game was a bit easy as well, and thats why i played on the higher difficulty setting. Personally my favorite game of all time is Dark Souls, so I understand what you're saying but I feel that just because you felt it was too easy doesn't mean it was a bad boss. Another inherent problem with hack n slash games is that more often than not dominant strategy is practically unavoidable and if the player isn't interested in trying to have fun themselves they will just spam the same attacks over and over. You may feel they were bad bosses, but I feel that they were fun to fight and overall good bosses. Again, people like different shit and everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and trying to argue that my opinion is wrong is just pointless. You're not promoting a discussion, you are saying that for a fact my opinion is wrong, and that's just pointless."
DevilMayCry,3c34gj,TBAAAGamer1,2,Sat Jul 4 15:31:55 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm just saying expand the opinion a bit if you're gonna do a review. your opinion is yours and I respect that. My opinion comes from the need to place what makes the game work. videogames have become increasingly subjective, so i had to remove my personal likes and dislikes from the review and try from a different angle, after all dark souls is a great game, but not that many people like it. so why is it a great game? because it's got amazing level design, enemy design, beautiful execution, etc. the problem is that games these days are becoming so unique to one another that it's no longer a matter of popular opinion, think the castlevania reboots, critics hate those games, but the players love them. so why is it a game with so many negative reviews is being enjoyed so much by the public? the answer? it's because the reviewers are working from a flawed critical foundation.  I like devil may cry and DmC, but if I tried to review it from the foundation of a classic devil may cry it'd be terrible in comparison because it's fundamentally different. anywho, my apologies if i'm coming off as abrasive, I respect your opinion, I just expect you to elaborate on what it is you liked about what you liked in the game. does that make sense?"
DevilMayCry,3c34gj,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"On your point that you compare it to the older games I'd have to make a parallel to Dark Souls 1 and 2. Dark souls 2 is a fantastic game in its own regard is an amazing game, but pales in comparison to the original. I feel comparing sequels to original games is fine but because DmC is a reboot of the series designed to change things around, I think it did so well, and that comparing it to the old games while important is also a bit of a disservice if you compare every single aspect. And about elaborating more, I have trouble getting my friends to read my reviews that are much longer than my review there, and thus it is even harder to expect a random person to read my review if even my friends are hesitant to read that long of a review, but if you want to read a more in depth review i've written you could check out my Mario Sunshine review."
DevilMayCry,3c34gj,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"Ever hear of ""Paying for every word?"" the idea is that you explain the point in as few words as possible. I'm not saying generate a wall of text, just quickly elaborate on what was interesting in as few words as you like. for example ""DmC's plot was interesting, the backstory with the angels, demons and nephilim was implied to be quite rich, the world's relation to limbo was intriguing, and the ""they live"" plot homage gave dante an excuse to get into some legimitately original and crazy situations such as fighting a bill o reilly knockoff's floating giant head while he shouts ""we'll do it live!"""

DevilMayCry,3c34gj,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"as for the story, my idea of what worked was, it had an interesting background lore but chose to parody ""they live"" in fact most of the story itself exists as an excuse to make go on crazy adventures and fight stuff in situations that, otherwise, wouldn't make sense. the plot gives the protagonist a reason to fight demons in an upside down underwater reflection of limbo city, a level made of dubstep and industrial music, literal corporate hell, a furnace that burns the souls of those in debt, a crazy carnival and a city that keeps trying to eat dante while sending hordes of demons to fight him. the story ties the insanity together and gives us a nice tidy plot that on its own, doesn't do much, in fact it kinda loses steam near the end when you eventually find out that despite being the bad guy, you're the guy messing all that up.mundus is also the status quo for the world's current order and.  The story serves the game's purpose by giving us a very interesting setting, but it does little to nothing for dante as a character until the final few levels."
DevilMayCry,3c34gj,ColdVergil,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:31:46 2015 UTC,"I feel that might've been the creators intentions Dante-wise, as they were kind of leaving his intentions a bit up to interpretation so they didn't directly tell you exactly everything that was going on and left a bit of ambiguity."

DevilMayCry,3c15ul,GameKing505,4,Fri Jul 3 20:49:25 2015 UTC,Guns just got a bit closer to how good they are in cutscenes  Just a bit.   Full Charged Shotguns can 1-Hit some on lower difficulties though
DevilMayCry,3c15ul,sujinjian,5,Sat Jul 4 03:48:02 2015 UTC,"Vergil first for me and Lady at a respectable second.    Vergil is self-explanatory.  I will input though, his concentration is a nice addition but the way they change his Dark Slayer tricks to react to Phantom Swords is really silly and hinders his fluidity from DMC3.   I do not like Trish a lot.  She doesn't really make sense, and I find it so hard to build up the style meter with her no matter how I change up the moves (and yes they connect), and I've noticed that it only works ala Dante and Nero when I throw the Sparda Sword at somebody but it shouldn't have to come down to that.  Lady is remarkable.  It's a whole different gameplay style and something fresh to the series and still manages to make sense in the universe.  I can totally see her kicking ass in her own game like that.  It's really fun and such a nice adrenaline feeling of joy when you do nice combos with her."

DevilMayCry,3c07x2,deesh8,2,Fri Jul 3 16:26:49 2015 UTC,The only tip you need with Vergil is that he can basically cancel EVERYTHING (except judgment cut end I think) with trick. This means you can continuously attack enemies and never get hit.

You can always jump and quickly use her first aerial melee strike since it comes out quicker.  She's definitely the hardest to get right- you just have to be ready a moment earlier than Nero or Vergil."
DevilMayCry,3bywpx,scionicspectre,4,Fri Jul 3 07:54:56 2015 UTC,"Didn't try with guns, her grapple hook always seemed to give the wrong number but I found melee to be fine as long as you throw it out the instant the number appears or just before. You just have to memorize which number comes before the number you want... I think the sequence is 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 5 if memory serves me right."
DevilMayCry,3bywpx,Bynoe,3,Fri Jul 3 11:05:39 2015 UTC,"had the same issue with nero using guns, chalked it up to playing on turbo mode and not being fast enough.  but then on vergil, and using yamato, i hit the right number almost every time, so maybe it's something to do with guns in the special edition.  but yea, you need to hit the die when it's on the number before the one you want, so if you want 4, hit on 5, or whatever the rotation is."

Just think of it like a spinoff series, like Megaman X was for the original Megaman games.  Anyway, I'm also enjoying DMC4SE.

DevilMayCry,3bzt47,ShiftyAxel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:12:02 2015 UTC,"TL;DR  I don't recommend it.  Long, technical version  Using a fightstick separates your hands' motor bandwidth between movement-only left, and action-only right. This is fine for fitegames, because they require complex stick motions and have a lot of buttons that most of the time aren't used simultaneously. Take Street Fighter 4 for example: you have 6 separate attack buttons, but rarely do you ever press more than one at a time unless you're going for a Grab, Focus Attack or EX Move.  A pad on the other hand, combines that motor bandwidth by mixing movement and actions between both hands. This works best for stuff like Character Action, because lock-on necessitates simple-yet-accurate stick movement, and there are a lot of instances where you'll need to use multiple buttons at once. For instance: charging a shot whilst locked onto an enemy and instant-revving Nero's Red Queen Combo A. That's two buttons that have to be held down while two others are tapped in an asynchronous rhythm. A way easier job when it's split between two hands.  Using a stick for DMC will make your life more difficult than it needs to be. When the action ramps up, your left hand will feel underused, your right hand will be overworked, and you'll have given up analog movement and camera control in exchange.  Source  I went through an 'Arcade Stick is the best controller for everything' phase a while ago. Decided that it would be a good idea to play through the Strider remake and MegaMan Zero with one. It ended up making the games way harder, and impacting my enjoyment because of the artificial hardware limit on my skill level. Also, hand cramps."
DevilMayCry,3bzt47,Hipster_Jesus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:30:09 2015 UTC,"Megaman is actually more intuitive on stick for me because charging while jumping and dashing is so much easier on stick than a pad. Holding buttons and hitting other buttons is actually easy on stick, it's even a mechanic for some characters in fighting games (Cody, Balrog, Juri in SF or even Vergil and Zero in UMVC3.) The lack of analog movement and camera controls like you said, are really the only things that kill this game on stick. Stick also has less buttons than a pad so you wouldn't even be able to bind all of Dante's moves unless you mod your stick with more buttons."
DevilMayCry,3bychr,snakehouse,6,Fri Jul 3 04:11:46 2015 UTC,"Don't let these guys be douchy/mean to you. I'll tell you what I think:  I tried auto in DMC4 (original) and hated how many moves are randomly performed by the game (ie. your example of using buster, but the game performs snatch instead).   In these kinds of action games you will really be doing yourself a favor by playing the game without auto. This way you will understand  how to move and fight with the character and will be more in CONTROL when you carry out creative and interesting combos.  Fortunately or unfortunately (depends on how you see it) the Devil May Cry franchise revolves around the difficulty, but also provides really good and easy mechanics for the player to use. If you want you can continue using Auto with the characters and enjoy the game to an extent, or you can try to play it without it and enjoy the full experience of what the Devil May Cry games have to offer.  tl;dr Play with auto and have fun with its limitations and setbacks of moves, or play without auto and have the time of your life with everything that the game offers.

I'm using Taksi for DMC4, but unfortunately it doesn't work for Special Edition.  Maybe I'll fudge up and just pay for a capture card already...  One thing about Taksi is that a 7 second capture ends up being about 1GB, so it's not exactly efficient or optimal on the practical end.  Thanks for the suggestions though!"

DevilMayCry,3bulpu,Cobajonicle,11,Thu Jul 2 07:36:55 2015 UTC,I honestly wish she was a bit more complicated... I have all these unused buttons on my controller :( I know they wanted to make her beginner friendly but still... She's quite fun and I love her S taunt though.
DevilMayCry,3bulpu,deesh8,6,Thu Jul 2 08:05:33 2015 UTC,"best char ever, spin off demanded, keep her for the next main series game as playable"
DevilMayCry,3bulpu,Mikolos,2,Thu Jul 2 09:09:39 2015 UTC,She's great. I'd say she's near Nero's level of complexity. The people who think she's oversimplified remind me of those who said the same about Nero.  Give it some time and you'll see there's a lot more to her.
DevilMayCry,3bulpu,scionicspectre,2,Thu Jul 2 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"Only played through Son of Sparda with Lady/Trish so far so maybe I'm just not quite used to her yet but although I didn't hate playing as her I'm definitely enjoying her least of all the chatacters for a few reasons:   A lot of her moveset feels a little laggy and lacking in hitstun; I often found myself getting punished by enemies like Frosts and Assaults even mid-combo. Her overall damage output feels pretty low. The only moves that felt like they were dealing good damage to me were charged Thunder Blows and Colliders (especially if you get the just-frame timing) so I found myself largely spamming them against bosses and tougher enemies. Her mobility feels pretty lacking, which isn't such a big deal against enemies that are susceptible to V Divider but otherwise I feel like the rest of the cast have better options to close distance and/or deal with enemies at range. Speaking of which her projectile game seems pretty awful; not having any kind of charge shot really hurts her and her Pandora attacks are pretty slow and linear therefore easily evaded and punished making Mephistos, Fausts, Chimeras and Blitzes a pain to deal with as her. I feel like she's definitely the most simple character due to not being able to change weapons and not really having as many advance techniques, yet for the reasons I listed above she's also one of the more difficult characters to use which is not a good combination.   So yeah, as I said I did still enjoy playing as her well enough but overall she's definitely my least favourite character."

DevilMayCry,3bt9kx,Mdger,5,Wed Jul 1 23:31:18 2015 UTC,"I personally found DMC4 not really that replayable (pretty sure this is an unpopular opinion though), but Special Edition surely is with it's 5 playable characters! Also, when you get bored of the campaings, Bloody Palace is always there as another way of having fun with the game!  And yeah, it's hella fast and fluid, but in case you want it even faster, there's even a turbo mode!  About your question now, there's always a skill list at your disposal whenever you want, just by pressing pause. Also, you start out with very little moves, and will upgrade your way throughout the game, buying skills every now and then with the ""Proud Souls"" you're awarded after every mission. This linear upgrading makes it so you have the time to learn your skills very well.   Also, you're kind of ""forced"" to learn how to combo moves, since the style meter (which has a great influence on the rank you get at the end of every mission, and also on how many Proud Souls you're awarded) does not rise if you keep repeating the same moves over and over, and we all eventually end up finding our favorite combos as we try and try again.  Not only do all 5 characters have unique styles of gameplay (Dante's multi-styled and multi-weaponized gameplay and Lady's longrange combat, for example), there are some unique tech here and there (in example, Nero's EX/MAX-acts, Dante's guard flying and Distorted moves) that, when combined all together, makes it so the game will always have certain things that you'll want to master - and feel great when doing so.  Hope you end up buying the game, pretty sure you'll love it!"
DevilMayCry,3bt9kx,xirog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:55:28 2015 UTC,Do the other characters have their own storylines or do you just play the base story as them?
DevilMayCry,3bt9kx,gagsy92,3,Thu Jul 2 02:24:50 2015 UTC,"Only Dante and Nero have actual cutscenes/stories troughout their campaign, as Vergil and Lady/Trish only feature a new opening and ending cinematic. Also, it seens Vergil has some special interactions with certain bosses. Other than that, it's just running through Dante/Nero's campaign with another character, unfortunately :c"
DevilMayCry,3bt9kx,xirog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:37:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, fair enough. I was hoping for them to at least have their own storyline, even if it's just a handful of missions. Same with Vergil, I was excited to see if he would have his own story which would link in with Nero and Dante's story somehow. I'll still buy the SE at some point though, I loved DMC4 so it would be nice to revisit it."
DevilMayCry,3bt9kx,gagsy92,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, no, Vergil does have a storyline. It is said to happen before DMC3, years before DMC4. My bad.

DevilMayCry,3bry5q,CouptDeVille,3,Wed Jul 1 17:43:03 2015 UTC,What if it's not really a glitch and this is the way of them bringing the 3-way judgement cut from DMC 3 in a sort of different yet hard way to do it?
DevilMayCry,3bry5q,ColdVergil,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:32:51 2015 UTC,"It is the most convoluted way to sort of... write an homage to the triple Fudge cuts, but damn that'd be awesome if this was the successor."
DevilMayCry,3bry5q,ColdVergil,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:39:39 2015 UTC,How do you do it btw? Been trying to but no success. My Vergil either teleports or just cancels the attack.
DevilMayCry,3bry5q,ColdVergil,2,Wed Jul 1 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"Well, do you mean the initial instant air judgement cut?  Or the subsequent ones?  First of all, you need to be doing Grim trick, ie: Lock on + teleport.  A normal trick won't work; however, once you have a sword embedded in the enemy you can freely let go of Lock on because of how Grim Trick works.  The repeated judgement cuts are actually plinks, meaning you scrub your finger from the Yamato attack button to the teleport button.  The action of so will have the teleport happen, but Vergil will be releasing an air Judgement Cut the first frame out of the teleport.  Now, the timing of when to do it is actually pretty tight, so you will find yourself finding the timing out again and again.  However, what is to note is that after the first air judgement cut, you want to plink the buttons swiftly; also there is no charging afterwords.  You are just pressing the attack button and quickly pressing the teleport button afterwords, fast enough.  I guess to really specify, you will be releasing the attack button as the teleport is happening, but because the plink is so fast, it's hardly worth mentioning... I think.  The timing itself; try to get the plink to come out right as the effect for sheating Yamato appears. The bright white sparkle.  However, this is for DT, and I haven;t yet analyzed OG Vergil, so I don;t now about him."

DevilMayCry,3bry5q,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"I managed to do this on the ground earlier. Total accident, but it would make sense as you can judgement cut off of any attack, and judgement cut is an attack. I've tried repeatedly to do it again but tbh I can barely time the first one.   Glitch versus intended doesn't bother me too much though, DMC is full of glitches that make the game better. I really doubt guard flying was an intended mechanic, but it's hard as hell to do and we all love it. Chain judgement cuts should fit right in here"
DevilMayCry,3bry5q,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"I totally see your point; if anything this makes Vergil a lot more.. well deeper than I first assumed?  Haha, but yeah, I wouldn't find it too surprising if it was intended."
DevilMayCry,3bry5q,DeusNasu,2,Wed Jul 1 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your findings. I was going to ask if it worked with Just Judgement Cut, but I think I confirmed that myself. If others want to test it out, I suggest Force Edge High-Time then Judgement Cut at the very top of the jump. Then, just fan between Melee and Trick."
DevilMayCry,3bry5q,ColdVergil,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"Oh damn, well the timing after Just Judgement Cut always threw me off, so it's cool to see that it works there too.  Damn, this is wonky!  Also, I find that, without the Upper Slash 2, doing the instant air-just judgement cut after a held-down Upper Slash works well as a Just Judgement cut time, idk that works for me :/"
DevilMayCry,3bry5q,ColdVergil,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"well, I can get a non-dt'd vergil to perform the jumpless judgment cut, but the subsequent ones are either hard to pull off or not charge reliant."
DevilMayCry,3bry5q,TBAAAGamer1,3,Wed Jul 1 22:03:25 2015 UTC,"The timing is pretty strict, but as for what's really going on... well fuck if I know.  Btw, this is actually my youtube video as well, so I can safely say that non-DT'd Vergil can do it just as well.  Also, the glitch works if you do the second cut on the ground, right after the instant air judgement cut, performing the ground one without a necessary charge."

Everytime the white flashes appear repeat the combination and that's it. I don't think this is a glitch now XD  The button setup interferes. My regular setup all these years melee on the X/Square and guns on the Y/Triangle. I coulnd't make it like this so I switched the melee to the guns button and now it's pretty easy to do. Tho I can't do anything else, it's hard to get used to it. Q_Q"

Those who hate DMC4, Those who love it.   Honestly everyone loves DMC4. Some of us hate the ""incomplete"" factor of it, but i believe more than 95% of the community still agree DMC4 is a great game. Actually, the DMC community is divided into those who hate DmC, and those who love it, if you were to ask me.   hate the Idea the Vergil is Nero's dad cuz it's cliche    Occam's Razor.   I don't like the Nero is a Vergil clone cause that creeps me out and kinda nonsensical.    It is kinda creepy, but it's far from being nonsensical. Agnus experimented with a bunch of things, who knows what he might have cooked up in that lab. Also, there are some things that indicate Agnus was trying to ""reproduce"" Vergil's abilities/moves. I always tought Gladius were an attempt of Agnus to make his very own Summoned Swords, for example.

DevilMayCry,3bqhx0,Snoofus,3,Wed Jul 1 09:30:49 2015 UTC,"if you are looking for a better combat experience pick DMC4, the story doesn't rely heavily on DMC3 otherwise, so you won't miss out much  but after finishing the main campaign, you may find yourself intrigued to find out more about some of the cast"
DevilMayCry,3bqhx0,Mikolos,2,Wed Jul 1 09:39:35 2015 UTC,"I started out with dmc 4 and then played the games prior and I still have a good understanding of the story. I would definitely recommend playing the other games as well. dmc 1 is really good, I personally wasn't a fan of dmc 2, and dmc 3 is amazing and so is dmc 4."
DevilMayCry,3bqhx0,goochclunker,2,Wed Jul 1 17:09:56 2015 UTC,The only good thing in DMC2 to me was Dantes design.

DevilMayCry,3bq68i,Morrowney,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:14:00 2015 UTC,"my personal opinion is that capcom doesn't want the series to drag out too long like most AAA game (cod,assassin's creed,ect...) and felt that it's a time for a new wind so to speak. what they didn't see is that we're attached to the sword wielding,gun slinging,foul mouth idiot named dante and the gang more than they thought we did. Thing is devil may cry as a title has always been a cult kinda game. It doesn't appeal to the majority of people. Only a selected group is into it and they will continue to support the game as long as it's stay true to it's form. Others who share the same mentality is nintendo,dynasty warrior or call of duty fans(given that cod is more mainstream than cult but you get the point)"
DevilMayCry,3bq68i,BadNewBearer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:24:55 2015 UTC,"It's not only that, the gameplay is a big step backwards from 3/4 so what's even the point?"
DevilMayCry,3bq68i,scumpile,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:50:49 2015 UTC,just an opinion but maybe because dante in DMC4 wasn't as forgiving to play as in the others dmc game Over the last 7 years i've played him enough to barely scrape by DMD mode in DMC4. But even then i don't feel like i'm doing the character justice. Dante in DmC: Devil may Cry is different. You can get use to him farely quickly by spending 2-4 hours with the control. You can compare the true style tournament videos between DMC4 and DmC : Devil may Cry and see that you can do most of the things they did in the DmC one quite easily. Though even I would preffer Nero over the new Dante anyday.
DevilMayCry,3bpbte,BakedlCookie,8,Wed Jul 1 01:51:20 2015 UTC,What? Nope. Beat DMD

Great job man!"
DevilMayCry,3bmh9y,Mikolos,4,Tue Jun 30 12:20:55 2015 UTC,"Great theory overall, as i had previously read most of it!  Honestly, i have a feeling that you're definitely right, but i actually think Capcom did all this, using certain names and, for example, making Dante talk about Dagon's smell (Nero does not, for some reason, which makes me think again that they only decided it after they got Dante's plot out of the paper).  Which, again, at least for me, means that yes, there was indeed supposed to be other bosses. They somehow tied these ""scrapped"" bosses to the existing ones using mythology just like you said, though.  And while it doesn't really affects your theory, i'd like to point out that the bosses don't actually ""drop"" these Devil Arms, they were already there, lying at the little pedestal in front of their respective hellgates.  Which also makes me wonder, if Devil Arms are the souls of powerful demons, where did Echidna's, Dagon's and Berial's went?"
DevilMayCry,3bmh9y,xirog,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"that's an interesting point you made right there XD  maybe they appear on the pedestal, on a place of high esteem, once the necessary sacrifice was made for those weapons to appear maybe? so their soul was used to initiate the ritual XD  but in case we go with that these bosses are cover ups for the never-appeared-ones, then the whole hellgate and ritual thing was also designed this way to cover stuff up, however what would have it taken for them to simply give a different name for their weapons? why were all this complicated symbolism needed anyway?  what if they spent so much time sitting on this project that it became this fleshed out? XD"
DevilMayCry,3bmh9y,Rhaegar_ii,4,Wed Jul 1 03:41:35 2015 UTC,The Pandora part is really grasping at straws IMO.
DevilMayCry,3bmh9y,ColdVergil,2,Tue Jun 30 15:59:48 2015 UTC,"yep that is the most abstract of them all, but imo it still somewhat could be the case as the names can stand together and paint a bigger picture, I might be expecting too much from capcom tho haha  edit: I'm not trying to sell this all as the ultimate truth tho, I just wanted it out there for the community to consider instead of always saying that the game has probably minimal effort in it story wise, or that the bosses and weapons have no connection between them"
DevilMayCry,3bmh9y,codebreak1337,2,Tue Jun 30 16:03:24 2015 UTC,Hmm after reading this now I think Capcom got these bosses as an excuse. XD But don't mind me.

DevilMayCry,3bnklx,Vindictive182,8,Tue Jun 30 17:31:58 2015 UTC,"Not really. They do hint towards things that happened in previous games, but there isn't anything that particularly spoils events in the early games. If you want to play chronologically, the series actually goes 3, 1, 4, 2 (though many people recommend not playing 2)."
DevilMayCry,3bnklx,mr-mercer,3,Tue Jun 30 17:55:02 2015 UTC,That's good because there is no way I was going to stop playing XD I'm only on mission 5 but was hooked from the tutorial! It's been a long time since a game has gotten me as hype as this!

DevilMayCry,3bnklx,Mikolos,6,Wed Jul 8 18:02:59 2015 UTC,"nope not at all, I started with it too back in 2008, the only thing that u miss is the backstory for 3 characters if you start with 4, also the combat is the best in this one . . . if you have a 360 or a ps3 you can pick up the HD collection if you want to, but imo those games are not really entertaining with our current standards, heck they looked dated 7 years ago. but you can view their cutscene collections, they are between 1.5-2.5 hours long individually, just to get to know some backstories"
DevilMayCry,3bnklx,TBAAAGamer1,2,Tue Jun 30 17:54:30 2015 UTC,start with dmc3 special edition  your eyes will vomit rainbows
DevilMayCry,3bnklx,lostgilgamesh,2,Tue Jun 30 20:38:05 2015 UTC,It's not strictly necessary you'll miss out on a few references but that's it...however if you can i highly reccomend you pick up the hd collection of the first three games dmc3 was outdated when i played it yet it's still one of my favorite games to date (it's basically dmc4 if dmc4 was finished) dmc1 is akso well worth your time......2 not so much.
DevilMayCry,3bnklx,KirillianAmurawr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:43:27 2015 UTC,"It is actually okay, Nero was designed for a newcomers. But, i still highly reccomend you to play DMC3:SE first, if you are on PC you will have trouble though. So you can just go and buy it on Steam but download a rom and play it on emulator, but if you are on console, just get HD Collection, it includes first 3 games, so you won't miss anything out."

DevilMayCry,3bmgvc,Mikolos,2,Tue Jun 30 13:16:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess they make more money off people re-buying the game instead of buying an update for a version that is already cheap by now (the pc version).

DevilMayCry,3blxgl,Regalian,2,Tue Jun 30 13:50:55 2015 UTC,"I think Bayonetta has better graphics generally but there is no version that has smooth 60 FPS all the time, the 360 version is the best one in the framerate aspect but even so framerate will drop at points where you don't want to and the combat is not as good as DMC4SE's combat  Also, despite saying that Bayonetta has better graphics I think it has worse looking cutscenes, though this may be because DMC4 actually has 2 different models for characters, one for gameplay and one higher quality for cutscenes"

DevilMayCry,3blkh6,Mikolos,2,Tue Jun 30 11:39:49 2015 UTC,"It's just surprising to me is all. IMO, DMC3 SE was the best of the series still (though my favourite Dante is DMC2), and prior to DMC4 SE release, DMC3 SE was the favourite amoung most. I guess it's just a sudden surprise to see the switch happen so quickly."
DevilMayCry,3blkh6,terrSC,3,Tue Jun 30 18:20:39 2015 UTC,"this is the vergil effect I suppose XD  and yes I see what u mean, I'm generally happy for this reception, capcom might see this too, trish and lady may once again see the light of day as playable characters in the franchise XD maybe even a spin off lol, I'm not even gonna dream about it tho, it'll probably never happen, just like Cutie J for bayonetta"
DevilMayCry,3blkh6,Mikolos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:25:41 2015 UTC,"Well not even just for Vergil. I think the story of DMC3 is better. I don't really like Lady or Trish tbh, but their involvement meant something to the story. in DMC4 SE they are minor charactes, and I don't like their gameplay at all. To each their own though."

I mean, arguably, DMC 3 SE is still the best DMC game, superior in every aspect (except DMC 4 combat).  The thing is tho... playing as Vergil in DMC4 makes it like 1000% more fun its beyond ridiculous (despite being Devil May Backtrack: Special Backtracking)... Plus we got Lady and Trish...  Replay value, character variety and combo potential is what makes  me like DMC4 SE a little bit more than DMC3 SE... at the moment tho, because i'm sure once i lose this ""fresh hype"", i'll be back at loving DMC3 to death..."

I change her shoot from square to R2 (if you have an xbox controller that's x to left trigger) then when I'm doing melee work and doing her special move on enemies i charge up my guns(pistol or shotgun) and when they're ready i just shoot i don't use the kalina ann(the rocket) regularly on enemy. It restrict my movement too much

DevilMayCry,3blhv5,Bill_Runberg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:50:01 2015 UTC,Very interesting. I'm guessing this works because Vergil is using both swords during Combo B. I wonder if there are other moves that allow Judgement Cut to be executed while Yamato isn't currently selected.

With all the enemies that her attacks hit and the different ways you can chain them, her early game functionality should be reworked so she isn't broken meter-wise when her full move list is unlocked.  Maybe an extra melee combo or more zipline functionality like OP suggested."

I love the speed that DmC allows, and the story was actually really good. Dialogue had some real stinkers ""You're Dante, no more, no less"" but the plot is an excellent origin story/retelling of how the world as we know it became the world we see in DMC3.  But I definitely appreciate how the main series ignores all attempts at a cohesive plot for spectacle and fun, and the controls and combos are much more precise.  The both have their place, but if I'm going to be completely honest... I don't play DMC anymore, the spectacle action games I still play are DmC and Bayonetta 2."
DevilMayCry,3biq1l,Shadow5040,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"No need to hide in a corner!  DmC also got me back into the series earlier this year, and i gotta say i played it a bunch. The gameplay, no matter what anyone says, is fun as hell (pun intended). I really liked the narrative, the whole capitalism and foul society philosophy the game talks about using Limbo, might look cliche, but even if it really is, Ninja Theory nailed that portrayal.  My personal opinion is that Dante's lines and actions (spamming middle fingers, for example) from the beginning towards 80% of the game were all pretty shitty, whereas the last 20% he actually stops trying to be a punk and turns into a more loveable character (reason why part of me actually looks forward for a DmC:2).  Also, getting to see a caring brother-brother relationship between Dante and Vergil felt really good. In the original series, we only get a glimpse of it on DMC3.  So yeah, don't worry. DmC isn't considered a bad game, but just a bad DMC game. Main reason is because nothing can really beat DMC. I'm 100% sure that if Ninja Theory never released that first trailer with the smoking Dante some years ago, the game would have had a much better reputation, even with Dante being a jerk."

Pandora has absolutely nothing to do with Bael or Dagon, the only similarities between Lucifer and Berial is that Lucifer's projectiles look fiery, and they really aren't.

DevilMayCry,3biikx,xirog,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:04:40 2015 UTC,"non taken haha  the tree is the tree of life which completely changed a snowy land into a forest, gilgamesh is not a tree, he is the hero of might, thus his weapon grants physical strength  berial is the CONQUEROR of firing hell, the conqueror which means that he defeated lucifer and killed him, which makes it possible for him granting that weapon, that explodes aka also has fiery attributes like himself and by this implication lucifer, after all he ruled in the firing hell  as for bael if you look him up he IS beelzebub who is also known for taking the looks of a toad, also is the lord of FLIES, which is often used to imply pestilence. whereas his brother dagon is the sort of god of GRAIN(life which is destoryed by the evil in pandora) and ploughing. so, in this sense it also makes sense that they grant you the weapon of pestilence which was sealed until you destroyed its owner granting you the most powerful weapon which also has forms like ""disaster"" proving the connection to the points I've made  ppl don't like to look up names but if you care to do you do find interesting tidbits that support and validate the existence of these weapons in this universe, without reaching back to concept arts we have never even seen and making assumptions on characters like Lucifer that were implied to have been bested by a number of sources in the core game itself"
DevilMayCry,3biikx,Mikolos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:48:08 2015 UTC,"That actually sounds very reasonable. Especially Berial's explanation you gave.  But i'm still not very convinced. In the novels (Altough not entirely canon) Dante used Lucifer against Berial and the latter was even surprised to see Lucifer had fallen to Dante. Also, i know Gilgamesh is not the tree.   What i mean is, what does it have to do with said Tree? And i don't think it is ever said that Echidna turned a snowy land into a forest. My honest opinion is that, even if what you said was the case, i'd say Capcom just named some of the weapons/bosses for the very reason of covering the unfinished game with very vague relationships based on actual mythology."
DevilMayCry,3biikx,xirog,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"from a snowy mountain you instantly stepped into a rainforest, and it was stated that it was the effect of a demon. probably the best known adventure of glilgamesh is related to the tree of life, and if we check another concept of echinda(she is very plantlike imo), she had a male head with a giant mane/beard and at this point the boss could have been gilgamesh a mashup between a tree of life and himself which then later was decided to be 2 seperate things, which probably makes more sense  as for the novel, that part might be the non canon as dante in the game fights him without it . . . but you know that too  I probably should have put up a disclaimer before writing my theories tho, this all is just my interpretation and theories based on what does exist in the game, my approach was why looking for missing stuff if the things that exist in the game might come to contradict with themselves creating a plot/lore hole, but in my opinion up to a certain level the existence of these bosses and weapons is validated. but we also can't forgot that this game spent at least 4 years in development, and this could be the reason why these things are so complex and are built on things we have never seen, but nevertheless could be the evolution of those past ideas"
DevilMayCry,3biikx,Mikolos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:39:34 2015 UTC,"I see.   About that early concept, i always looked at it like a lion head though!   And about stepping into a forest from a snowy field, Fortuna city was all sunny too, and all of sudden you're in a snowy field. If i recall correctly, wasn't the blizzard caused by a demon, not the forest?"
DevilMayCry,3biikx,danteuzumaki,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:09:30 2015 UTC,"yeah both were caused by a demon   but a male lion at that XD  anyways, I'm still not saying that this is a 100% what I tried to squeeze out of the game, as hideki kamiya said regarding bayonetta's story, this is just a game, don't think too hard about it XD"

DevilMayCry,3bherm,ShiftyAxel,3,Mon Jun 29 22:51:46 2015 UTC,"I never enjoyed playing Dante in 4. There was a period where I tried to git gud and develop some proper skills with him, but similar to you OP, playing as the other characters has put paid to that.   I'm likely in the minority on this one, but I hope they scale him back to DMC3 levels of complexity for the next game. I love Dante as a character, but hate the ever-present feeling that I'm not making full use of his skillset.  They spread him too thin in my opinion. Tons of tech, but he's shit-tier unless you put in the years of practice required to learn it. It's like going from a Street Fighter 2 movelist to a Tekken 5 movelist over the course of one sequel."
DevilMayCry,3bherm,Grey-Frog,3,Mon Jun 29 11:07:27 2015 UTC,"glad i'm not the only one with this problem. thing is ... i wanna git gud with him, and to play him more properly. But the skills are extactly like you said, spreading thin and seems so much watered down compare to dmc3 levels."
DevilMayCry,3bherm,Blazer-X,3,Mon Jun 29 12:13:06 2015 UTC,"I feel the same as you. I love Dante but even when I manage to pull some stuff off with him in DMC4 I feel like I'm not doing the character justice.  Perosnally, I hope in DMC5 they find a proper way to include all his style moves into one moveset to eliminate style switching. DmC removed way too much in their attempt to combine them: but I think it is do-able if they take cues from other games like Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising. But I'm probably in the miniority in wanting this, too."
DevilMayCry,3bherm,Shadow5040,2,Mon Jun 29 14:18:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah. More or less this. For one reason or another, Dante's default moveset on his weapons feels very limited and incomplete. Swordmaster feels like a necessity when it comes to really fleshing out his melee moveset. In addition, his Pandora and Lucifer pretty much require their respective styles to make any real advance use out of.  Believe it or not, I actually want them to incorporate some of DmC's control scheme into the game. Before you start raising your pitchforks, here is what I mean:  DmC has ""dodge"" for the bumpers, AX (or whatever it is in PS) for Gun-special and L3R3 for Devil Trigger. I would love to just change that slightly to a ""trickster move"" for left bumper, keeping the right bumper for lock-on. Then use AX for special gun moves, B for ""swordmaster moves"" and L3R3 for Devil Trigger.  This gives us 3 of the styles (Trickster, Gunslinger, and Swordmaster) in one control pad. Not perfect (missing RG), but its a start."
DevilMayCry,3bherm,Vergilkilla,2,Tue Jun 30 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"Dante in DMC4 has always felt pretty clunky to me. Dunno why though. Vergil feels great though, I think he's pretty great for beginners."

Of course, I've been thinking a lot about tutorials and the such having a more official capacity here, but you can only have one sticky at a time (and we wouldn't want multiple stickies anyway).

She can't do enough damage quickly enough to prevent the Blitz going into its red phase based on my experience."
DevilMayCry,3bf8tk,Bloodhit,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:04:23 2015 UTC,Nero. And Trish probably will be the hardest.
DevilMayCry,3bf8tk,kampasta,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:08:43 2015 UTC,"dante.  You can just melee him like normal, and with good use of royal guard you can parry the lightning shield damage.  Blitz shield was only designed to be shot at, so actually hitting it drops it damn quick. After it's down a setup into a distorted real impact or just release will end him pretty fast.  A really good royalguard can also use blitz lightning attacks to instantly fill their rage meters, and dropping a blitz shield with a distorted royal release basically lets you start the damage phase with a nearly dead blitz.  If the royal guard option doesn't sound good, you can also pump him full of lucifer needles with pin-up, which if you DT becomes a two hit combo for twice the needles.  But if you need to play it ultra safe, trickster and a shotgun will also work, just slowly"

DevilMayCry,3bfk1q,scionicspectre,5,Tue Jun 30 03:10:38 2015 UTC,"You can trick down, back, and to the side so long as you're in Devil Trigger- just use the jump button as you would with a side-roll. In fact, the input doesn't even have to be that precise.  So long as you stay locked-on or walking, you won't be penalized for moving around. Vergil's most impressive moves are reserved for players who concentrate on efficiency this time around, which is a stark contrast to DMC 3: SE Vergil.  For the Angelos, I'd recommend tricking to them, then side-rolling around or jumping behind them quickly to lose the least amount of concentration possible. That's probably the fastest and easiest way to do it without running around."
DevilMayCry,3bfk1q,Kityraz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:59:06 2015 UTC,"Trick often, rapid slash more often.

DevilMayCry,3bfi9u,Tehno9,8,Sun Jun 28 19:37:02 2015 UTC,"Yes- nothing has been found over the last 7 years of looking.  It's very clear that, if there were leftover bits of the game, they were either removed from the final game (the professional thing to do) or they were simply left out of development altogether.  I'd say it's far more likely that they left those ideas behind after the design phase. That is, the game's final intended design, cultivated from the concept phase, is exactly what we got. Most games have a great deal of concept art that is abandoned before any work on the actual game begins."
DevilMayCry,3bfi9u,scionicspectre,6,Sun Jun 28 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"Perfect. I also like to add that early concept is just that, an early concept. The designer's job has a lot of trial and error, going back to the drawing board, changing stuff because of feedback, etc.    When you see multiple costumes and weapons, it doesn't necessarily mean that Nero would change outfits during the campaign or his Devil Bringer would evolve. It's just that what we got in the final game is the product of a non-linear process."

DevilMayCry,3be7sm,gekimayu,3,Mon Jun 29 12:08:42 2015 UTC,"Red Queen - Its design embodies the series for me: creative, engaging, anachronistic and juvenile. A romantic fantasy with a rebellious spirit.    EDIT: From a gameplay perspective I can't choose one, because they're all situational and made to complement each other."
DevilMayCry,3be7sm,Monocorno,3,Sun Jun 28 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"Nero: Definitely Red Queen. Learning MAX-act and watching those fiery effects as you melt the enemy is outstanding.  Dante: Since my favorite in DMC4 is Rebellion, i'll add that my favorite in 3 were Agni & Rudra :)  Vergil: I really don't have a favorite gameplay-wise, i use all of them a lot. But gameplay aside, Yamato for sure <3  Lady: Kalina Ann. The forward+lock+style with the interactive locking-in attack is so freaking awesome. That, and melting bosses with well-timed lvl 3 charges are really big factors.   Trish: Still haven't touched her."
DevilMayCry,3be7sm,xirog,3,Sun Jun 28 18:13:20 2015 UTC,"Nero:   1) Red Queen:   I like the small mini game mechanic of ex-act/max-acting it to make it stronger.  PS: I like the idea of using ""wind"" when it's not exceeded and then using ""fire"" when it is exceeded.   Dante:   1) Lucifer:   You can be very creative with these floating swords either using them as traps or using them for defense PS: Dante's very own weapon that is sorta similar in appearance to Vergil's summoning swords.   2) Pandora's Box:   Increasing disaster gauge by using 4 different types of fire-arms Using the disaster gauge with 3 special attacks (boomerang, ship-thing, and explosive thingy) PS: The idea of ""Pandora's Box is actually a box... kind of, but more like a suitcase which is close enough.   Vergil:  1) Yamato   With the added new features and abilities Vergil gets in DMC4-SE, his Yamato has become a lot more creative and fun with its own mechanics (ie. judgement cut and quick judgement cut) PS: The way Vergil holds and uses Yamato is really cool and interesting, and by this I'm referring to his sheathing and holding the sheath with his left hand."
DevilMayCry,3be7sm,Diabel_Hanta,2,Sun Jun 28 19:01:12 2015 UTC,"My favorite has got to be Red Queen. I've always loved playing Street Fighter and other fighting games, so the idea of EX moves always excite me."
DevilMayCry,3be7sm,TheMasterOfMetal,2,Sun Jun 28 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"Nero: Well, he has all of 3 weapons. And only one real melee weapon.... So Red Queen it is! For what it's worth though, I love the design of the weapon. The gameplay for it varies on how much exceed I could have. On super costume, it is pretty awesome.  Dante: I like Rebellion's design the most, hands down. But if we're talking gameplay, I find myself using Gilgamesh much more. Full House, Kick 13, and DRI all day every day.  Vergil: Beowulf WAS my favorite weapon back in DMC3, simply due to its damage potential and our favorite Lunar Phase. Now that he finally got a proper update, I'd say the winner goes to his signature Yamato. Rapid Slash + Perfect Slice Judgment Cut? KNEEL BEFORE ME!  Trish: Sparda... although all things considered, was there ever any doubt?  Lady: I like Kalinna Ann's design. But gameplay-wise, I have to give it up to the shotgun."
DevilMayCry,3be7sm,Blazer-X,2,Tue Jun 30 14:47:28 2015 UTC,Overall Yamato is my favorite.  I just started playing with Vergil on Son of Sparda to get both achievements at the same time and holy hell is he OP with it and Trick.  For Dante I just love screwing around with Lucifer because it's so different than any weapon he's had since the guitar in 3.
DevilMayCry,3be7sm,BigBoy1229,2,Sun Jun 28 15:21:27 2015 UTC,"Mine will always be Yamato. I love Katanas, they show respect, honor, discipline. I've always loved the way of the samurai.

DevilMayCry,3bd6y4,ColdVergil,3,Sun Jun 28 02:43:44 2015 UTC,"it's too bad he gave up on DMC . . .   I disagree with some of his views on it all tho, while it is a fact that sony's bad start with the ps3 caused some great changes to the series, multiplatform for example which may not be the case for the next whenever it is coming if at all installment, but . . . in my opinion the game's change from dark to more cheerful was the right call from capcom and not only a ""oh sorry we had no budget"", cuz they could have made a dark game with the same budget  given DMC1's ending this tone made sense for dante, he can't be an emo kid while all his problems are gone(vergil, mundus and the case of his parrents) and the only thing he needs to do is to hunt demons with his mother's demonized replica . . . tho I could imagine the trip to hell happening in the middle of the game"
DevilMayCry,3bd6y4,Mikolos,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:13:54 2015 UTC,"But imagine it if had been released with all this stuff. It wouldn't be surpased by any other action game whatsoever other than DMC itself. And that Nero too looked real badass, just as Dante and Vergil.  Those different devil triggers, and the perfect devil trigger or ascended really got me. That shit looks great. All those enemies were more DMC than the ones on DMC 4 now. Dante is in hell and he finds Vergil, either they fight or they go full co-op, why? Imagine Sanctus not only finds Sparda's power also find Mundus's as well, Dante and Vergil have to find a way outta hell while Nero is going through all that shit in Fortuna. Holy fucking shit best plot ever. They missed a big chance there.  Eitherway, DMC 5 could re-arrange this stuff. Really looking forward to it and Itsuno probably has in mind all of this. Given the fact that he just added that concept art Nero costume, we might have see the best DMC if DMC 5 is announced. It has been 7 years and the original team didn't work on this Special Edition so they might be busy on something else?"

The doppelganger and the Vergil fight against Arkham where you could plug another controller, Itsuno said that this were tries of co-op but due to the nature of the game it could not have been done so that's why they ended up like that. It was no possible.  How could it felt complete lol? So many plot holes, Dante gets weapons from who knows where, Nero does not get his full Devil trigger. How did Agnus got Yamato? Dude what..."

DevilMayCry,3bd0n6,Tehno9,10,Sun Jun 28 01:36:57 2015 UTC,"It's been known for a while that DMC4 is honestly an incomplete game. Not only are Gilgamesh, Pandora and Lucifer all named differently than their bosses, like you mentioned, but their design is completely different too.   In DMC3 you would defeat a three headed ice beast and you would earn a three headed nunchuck. Defeat an eletric-y vampire lady, and you'd get an eletric, bat-summoning guitar. Defeat a punching lightbeast, and you'd get melee light-gauntlets and light-boots.  And then, in DMC4, you defeat a flying plant-snake-lady thing, and what do you get? A geared, metal looking, armor thing. Not only it doesn't makes sense visually, but Gilgamesh's description is pretty specific, too. It says it can turn anything organic into steel. What?  I was really wishing for DMC4 SE to actually fix the game, and it got me pretty mad for a while, but well, no one gets mad for too long when you can play Vergil."
DevilMayCry,3bd0n6,xirog,3,Sun Jun 28 02:08:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the Devil Arms in DMC3 are actually the souls of the bosses you defeat.  In DMC4, those Devil Arms are simply used to power the Hell Gates. Why the 3 bosses themselves never spawned Devil Arms is a mystery though."
DevilMayCry,3bd0n6,sujinjian,3,Sun Jun 28 03:43:05 2015 UTC,"In DMC 3, Dante's Devil Arms were given willingly (save for Beowulf, which was left by Vergil) by the demons themselves. I do not know how he was portrayed in other medias, but given how he behaves in DMC 3, I would guess he is not the kind of guy who would actively enslave other demons to fight as his weapons."
DevilMayCry,3bd0n6,Pepperglue,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:11:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's that.

Dante was originally supposed to have his own unique missions but the game's development ran into a lot of hitches from what I recall. I don't have the sources at hand but you should be able to find them with a little sleuthing around."

World recycling, even bosses recycling, not actually seeing Dante obtain Lucifer, Pandora and Gilgamesh since It's pretty much clear when you kill demon in DMC 3 gives you a weapon with the same name. The lack of story is huge. Don't know where Nero comes from, don't know how Agnus gets Yamato, etc. So that's why most of the stuff he says seems logic. If you search that DMC 4 was not finished or rushed there are tons and tons of post and article through the internet."
DevilMayCry,3bd6ai,ComboBr34k3r,2,Mon Jun 29 19:48:41 2015 UTC,"As I said, I'm not saying the guy is definitely full of shit and everything he says is wrong, but he claims to know a lot of things that I've never heard mentioned anywhere else and doesn't give any sources on it other than ""The devs said""... where does this 40% complete stastic come from? How does he know Dante was supposed to be fighting demons in hell? Where was it stated that Nero was supposed to have multiple styles? Without proper sources this all sounds like speculation and conjecture to me, which would be fine if the guy didn't present it like hard fact."
DevilMayCry,3bd6ai,Tehno9,2,Mon Jun 29 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"I just thought those were some pretty cool ideas. Maybe something will be out of it in the future but yeah, just speculation."
DevilMayCry,3bd6ai,Bloodhit,2,Mon Jun 29 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"Complaints are just opinions not facts. Reviews are just opinions not facts. Nothing here backs the claims made in the video.  In DMC 1 Dantes kills bosses and don't get Devil Arms. Nero's origin is more than obvious for anyone who can put the clues together. Agnus gets yamato the same way he gets fragments of Vergil's soul.  DMC4 was a rushed game, but anything about cut content is just fan speculation."
DevilMayCry,3bd6ai,Tehno9,2,Mon Jun 29 20:34:03 2015 UTC,Yep you are right. It's just fan speculation.

DevilMayCry,3bd6ai,Tehno9,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:21:13 2015 UTC,I found him like last week. Guy is pretty cool. Who knows? Maybe with a complete DMC 5 he gets back on DMC.
DevilMayCry,3bd6ai,ShiftyAxel,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:26:05 2015 UTC,"I know right. I found his videos after he did the ""Is vergil too OP"" video and then he just decides he doesn't want to do DMC content anymore."
DevilMayCry,3bd6ai,Slothman899,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:36:10 2015 UTC,"So let me get this right: the game was 40% complete and it outsold most other DMC games, and they don't remake it? How fucking stupid or lazy are Capcom?  A complete DMC 4 would've just destroyed everything else, it would have been THE action game."
DevilMayCry,3bd6ai,Tehno9,3,Sun Jun 28 10:21:16 2015 UTC,"A complete DMC 4 would've just destroyed everything else, it would have been THE action game.   But would it be? Spending a lot of resources to finish other half of the 7-8 year old game, doesn't sound like a very good idea.  We can only hope for good DMC 5."

DevilMayCry,3bchov,OnyxMemory,3,Sat Jun 27 22:28:23 2015 UTC,Put the gun in the place of the exceed trigger and put exceed on the other one
DevilMayCry,3bchov,Tehno9,3,Sat Jun 27 22:58:56 2015 UTC,What's the reason for not putting it on Right trigger and using your middle finger for shoot and index finger for lock-on?
DevilMayCry,3bchov,T_Nartey,2,Sat Jun 27 23:35:41 2015 UTC,"I usually remap gun button to L1 (or LB on 360 control), exceed to L2. Devil Trigger to square. I also remap L1 button for gun for all other characters.   cheers"
DevilMayCry,3bchov,Raiden99999,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"Experiment, and find a setup that feels natural to you.  Myself, I move Gun to RT because it's comfortable to hold down on my XBone pad, and Taunt on X for easier access."
DevilMayCry,3bchov,ShiftyAxel,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:27:25 2015 UTC,"I use this layout:   RB: Gun RT: Exceed LB: Devil Trigger LT: Lock-On   It takes awhile to get used to Ex-Act with your middle finger, rather than your index finger. Just using both fingers on the shoulder buttons might be a bit of a challenge depending on your playstyle."
DevilMayCry,3bchov,itsachickenwingthing,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:13:37 2015 UTC,"My set up is really simple and easy for newcomers and pro-players:   R1/RB = Lock-on L1/LB = Devil Trigger R2/RT = Blue Rose (Pistol) L2/LT = Red Queen's Exceed Other Btns = Default   Practice with this and you should be able to use Nero's level three shot (Effect: Double explosion) for Blue rose as well as his 6 summoning swords while in Devil Trigger.  PS: To master Nero, you will have to get used to holding down R2/RT (Pistol) for most of your combat time as well as ex-act/max-act (L2) whenever you slash."
DevilMayCry,3bchov,Diabel_Hanta,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:58:01 2015 UTC,Seems like Gun to RT/R2 is the most common setup. I've always gone with swapping Gun and Devil Trigger (so LB/L1 and X/Square respectively). Exceeding with my middle finger feels pretty natural now.
DevilMayCry,3bchov,FarAsYouCanThrowMe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:44:02 2015 UTC,"As nero I have the guns on my right trigger, Attack on x, Devil Bringer on B, Taunt on Y, Jump A and the rest same. I do this so I can keep the trigger pressed and charge up the shot and use it when I want.   I also have the gun set to Right trigger for dante and virgil (swords)."
DevilMayCry,3bcgsg,xx420sniparsspaghett,6,Sat Jun 27 22:20:18 2015 UTC,HD collection and then 4 special edition on the PC
DevilMayCry,3bcgsg,Tehno9,6,Sat Jun 27 22:50:41 2015 UTC,"Like /u/Monocorno said, the chronological order is 3, 1, 4, 2 but I would play them in release order as even though it's an amazing game, 1 may not have aged well for some people, it's much much slower than 3 so playing 1 after 3 might affect your enjoyment of it. Feel free to skip 2 if you wish too, it's not very well liked and doesn't have much importance story-wise."
DevilMayCry,3bcgsg,Hka9,5,Sun Jun 28 00:01:21 2015 UTC,I also think you would have more appreciation for DMC 3's story if you played DMC 1 first.
DevilMayCry,3bcgsg,scionicspectre,5,Sun Jun 28 03:01:12 2015 UTC,"I second this. Playing in order of release is always the best way to go imo, lest you spoil yourself with advanced gameplay and lessen your appreciation for the earlier titles.  2 doesn't exist though. Really weird how they skipped a number and went straight to 3, eh?"
DevilMayCry,3bcgsg,ShiftyAxel,3,Sun Jun 28 11:22:55 2015 UTC,"Start with either 3 or 1. I'd say 1, as it fits in better learning mechanics and story, but 3 definitely had better gameplay and edgier cutscenes."
DevilMayCry,3bcgsg,Perplexed_Comment,6,Sun Jun 28 01:36:01 2015 UTC,"3, 1, 4, 2, if you want to play in chronologic order.    HD Collection(PS3) + DMC4SE(PS4/PC/XBOX ONE) is the way to go."
DevilMayCry,3bcgsg,Monocorno,10,Sat Jun 27 22:53:01 2015 UTC,"I second this, with the added suggestion that you pretend 2 didn't exist.  I'm pretty sure it is no longer a part of the canon story.  Also, the 2013 DMC: Devil May Cry remake is a re-imagining of the series, and is a very different universe than the original games."
DevilMayCry,3bcgsg,mindfulnessfan,3,Sat Jun 27 23:29:46 2015 UTC,"Devil May Cry (HD Collection) Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition (HD Collection) Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition   Devil May Cry 2 is very tedious and not all that fun, having been taken on by a very different team."

DevilMayCry,3baxs0,daviee,5,Sat Jun 27 13:52:53 2015 UTC,Storywise DMC1 takes place after DMC3 as for DMC2 it takes place after DMC4 but not alot of people consider DMC2 canon because of how horrible it is.
DevilMayCry,3baxs0,TheGamingElement,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:22:32 2015 UTC,Well isn't that a bit weird. Since Dante knows Trish in DMC 4 means that DMC 1 took place before DMC 4
DevilMayCry,3baxs0,WingGundam,8,Sat Jun 27 16:25:37 2015 UTC,It goes like 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2.
DevilMayCry,3baxs0,num3r0uz,4,Sat Jun 27 16:52:32 2015 UTC,"dmc2 is considered non-canon.  dmc1 is the greatest thing to have ever happened to gaming, right up there with dmc3, the greatest game in existence.  it's also a lot slower, originally being a discarded resident evil idea, dmc3 is leagues better, but dmc1 invented the stylish combat genre and lord is it good. tight combat, fun to play, infuriating bosses, playable sparda mode, extremely bad voice acting."
DevilMayCry,3baxs0,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:13:59 2015 UTC,I mean what's the story? I dont want to get confused by just playing 3 4 and dmc. Is there any important thing I should know storywise?

DevilMayCry,3baxs0,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:27:50 2015 UTC,"1?  Oh 1's plot is pretty basic.  Dante is a halfdemon devil hunter and the son of a legendary OP demon called sparda who fought for mankind. sparda was killed when dante was young, as was his mother.  dante later vows to hunt down all of demonkind in revenge and becomes an impromptu mercenary with a stare so icy that it could make the devil cry.  some demon chick called trish comes into his office and greets him by impaling him with his own sword and throwing a bike on top of him, which then explodes.  she then tells him that she is not his enemy.  ...i swear i'm not making this up.  she hires him to stop mundus from coming to the world, he agrees, goes to a scary haunted castle in the ass end of nowhere the pacific ocean(or atlantic, the details are sketchy) and he enters the castle, fights demons, meets a demon that almost kills him called ""nelo angelo"" who takes the form of an OP dark knight that teleports in blue flames.  despite the OP nature of this foe, nelo is honorable, and though he never says a word in the entirety of his time fighting dante, dante begins holding the mysterious demon knight in high regard.  during his travels he meets a ton of other powerful demons that speak, and most of what they say is ""Do you have a moment to speak with me in the middle of combat about our lord and savior mundus?"" dante roflstomps them, impales one, and another is killed off by mundus himself, who manifests from time to time, making dante very mad because what kind of asshole kills his fanatically devoted servants? (aside from god)  dante fights nelo one last time, and nelo removes his helmet during this final confrontation and goes so OP that you begin to wonder who he is. and though he looks nothing like dmc vergil, if you do a side by side comparison, his facial features are almost identical to DmC vergil's.  Design  Nelo explodes in blue flaming portaly explosion of ""he's probably not dead but right now let's say he is for plot closure"" and dante gets the other half of his perfect amulet, which tells him one of two things, one, things are about to die, and two that random knight was his brother the whole time. so dante turns force edge into the brokenly powerful sword sparda, trish tries to kill him, he roflstomps trish, then fights mundus, who kills trish as she tries to protect dante (god she's mercurial.)   Dante sparda-fies himself with the power of the sword and mundus, who is a giant superpowered statues, engages him in one of the coolest aerial battles ever. then they fight in a volcanic crater  then one last time under mallet island, and dante is helped by trish this time. then they fly off in an infuriating plane escape sequence, and end credits.  devil may cry 1 ladies and gentlemen. devil may cry 1."

Mostly it's just pre-rendered garbage and that's super immersion breaking for me. DmC had also this problem. Most of the cuscenes were in engine but there were a few pre-rendered ones.
DevilMayCry,3ba5xo,NKLhaxor,2,Sat Jun 27 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"It just suits the game way better and doesnt, lets say, Final Fantasy's it. In Final Fantasy you get those extremely super awesome cutscenes but when you go and play damn xD"

DevilMayCry,3ba5xo,KevinLee487,0,Sun Jun 28 00:47:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure if sarcasm or not. Not all DMC3 Cutscenes were pre render, they just used separated HQ models."
DevilMayCry,3ba5xo,KirillianAmurawr,0,Sun Jun 28 08:43:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, they were pre-rendered. A good giveaway is how despite using different costumes, Dante or Vergil's appearance in cutscenes never changes.  Also, look at their coats during the cutscenes. They move the same EXACT way in every respective scene no matter how many times you view it despite it NEVER doing that during gameplay. Those are the two major giveaways I noticed.  In DMC4, the coats are much stiffer so you can't really tell even though we know DMC4s scenes are real time anyway."
DevilMayCry,3ba5xo,KevinLee487,0,Sun Jun 28 22:22:52 2015 UTC,"No they were not, dude who are you kidding. Hi Res models and models in game always will be bloody different. Hi Resolution models always will use: Higher Quality of models themselves, MUCH MORE Bones in rigged skeleton, allowing for a lot more complex animation. Same method were used in a lot of games, metal gear games is also an example. (Not rising) As for costumes, They didn't made any of them for cutscenes. Do i really have to prove it to you through texmod or something, because i can go and redownload the game and do that."

He confirmed in this interview that what we read earlier was a mistranslation (he essentially never said anything about DMC4: SE sales hastening the development process for DMC 5). Also, if anything, he's making it sound like DmC is over and through.  Just because he's happy with how the game performed and respects his own work on it doesn't mean we're getting DmC 2 before DMC 5. Your inferences are rather confusing."
DevilMayCry,3b8uxq,scionicspectre,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:51:00 2015 UTC,"that was weeks ago and capcom decided to deconfirm the press they gave NOW after DMC4SE is out and probably made back all the money they spent on it pretty much day 1  I don't wanna go deeper with this cuz you are good guy from what I've seen of you, but they have quite frankly and literally lied to us, they decide what their press is, and it wasn't coming from one source but from a number of them, and throughout weeks, I feel like I'm repeating myself at this point, if you don't see the connections or the points I make then w/e it is bad enuff that I have to  he is talking about coexistence and that both of them can stay around and with the press they are giving now once again AFTER they hyped up DMC4SE with potential DMC5 the past months, he is saying that no sorry we really don't have any plans for DMC5. and you are telling me that the word once again from him about coexistence and no plans for DMC5 doesn't imply that to you that DmC2 might very well happen at this point then da faq? I might get angry for no reason, but fuck we might not see DMC5 happening till the ps5"
DevilMayCry,3b8uxq,Mikolos,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:04:05 2015 UTC,"They're not deconfirming anything because it was never confirmed. It was a mistranslation, not a PR misstep. I just think it's unfair to make too many assumptions based on this information.  I mean, a lot of people are saying this is B.S. simply because the original mistranslation was B.S. (which isn't Itsuno himself as a source but a news organization incorrectly translating an interview and distraught fans forwarding it incessantly as propaganda).  But yes, there are other times he has been misleading and Capcom does shady things, so if those are your reasons then by all means I understand your opinion. But, in this particular instance, Itsuno didn't flip-flop or contradict himself.  Now, on your insistence that DMC 5 is being called off and DmC 2 is a possibility, let's take some of what Itsuno said here.  ""After Devil May Cry 4 came out and then Ninja Theory's DMC: Devil May Cry followed it, some fans were disappointed and felt the main series had ended. But I'm glad that the message is out there with Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition that the main series is not over, and that DMC: Devil May Cry did not kill it. But that isn't to say that the latter was just a one shot, that game also got it's own next-gen re-release earlier this year.""  The main series is not over, and DmC wasn't a one-shot (the rerelease is the second shot, presumably).  ""If it had been a world changing hit, it might have changed the course of the series by becoming the new DMC.""  He's saying that it didn't become a hit, and therefore will not replace the original DMC. He goes on to say that, with the next chapter in DMC, he's not sure if they would take on a partner to codevelop with.  There is just as much evidence to support my inferences as yours, so I think it's safe to say we can't make assumptions either way. If we have equally good reasons to hear 'DMC is back' or 'DmC has a chance with a different partner', that essentially means it's null and we don't know anything about what the future could hold.  Considering the logistics of getting a DmC 2 going, however, I highly doubt it's going to happen. Ninja Theory is rather busy in each of their departments and have stated they don't plan to pick up the series again. Itsuno has helmed every main series DMC except the first, so they're unlikely to throw that to someone else entirely.  If there's going to be any more Devil May Cry at all, all signs point to Itsuno making DMC 5 in my mind. But again, that's just my opinion, and I have about as much evidence for it as anyone having evidence for DmC 2, so I'm not going to say it's the truth. Also, I'm sorry for digging into this and giving you a wall of text, since I respect you as well and consider you a good person, too. I'd be perfectly willing to continue the conversation with you in a more private setting if that's more comfortable since I think we could reach an understanding with more information and less... I dunno', confrontation?"
DevilMayCry,3b8uxq,scionicspectre,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:09:01 2015 UTC,"yep I'm not calling on him out personally but on capcom as a whole and their missleading press, the only press they had actually said that DMC5 is planned and/or in the works, it's not like the net was flooding with other stuff, if they wanted to and didn't do it on purpose they could have sent out a correction, but they didn't hence the shady part and the pushing for sales in DMC4SE's case(at least this is what I think about this sudden pulling out), although, it's not like he gave a live interview so I even doubt that he himself gave any of those answers   and I'm just assuming the worst, hellblade is coming next year, if DMC5 is not announced by then, chances are in 2017 we could get just as well prepared for either"
DevilMayCry,3b8uxq,Mikolos,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:20:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the sad fact is that you can't really take anything Itsuno says in full sincerity seriously, mistranslation or not, since Capcom makes the decisions. His desires are essentially irrelevant until they throw him a bone.  I definitely get what you mean by them having ample opportunity to correct the news during the past week or so that information has been available. Of course, PR is often very slow to respond, especially for a game that is considered small or insignificant to the larger gaming audience (which DMC often is, sadly). In this particular instance, I'm subscribing to Hanlon's razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."

If I recall correctly, the opening screen isn't pre-rendered so at least we know you're able to render a 3D scene correctly. Hm. I'd recommend setting everything to the lowest setting and staying in windowed mode. If that works, gradually scale the settings up from there.  Aside from that, I still can't find anything on this issue, so you may want to try your luck on the game's Steam forums.

A lot of people are theorizing that the woman in red is Nero's mother. We have no way to know if this is true, but it does seems that woman is significant in some way. It's curious to note that her role isn't resolved in the final scene, so we may see her again in the future."

It's not deniable at this point, Nero is Vergil's sprog.  The woman in red in the DMC4SE opening is most likely a nod towards that, I can't think of any other reason for her to be there.  As to timeline issues, there's nothing stopping Capcom from retconning their previous timeline-related statements into something more reasonable. They've done serious retcons to DMC's canon before, and timeline modification wouldn't be nearly as extensive as previous retcons."

DevilMayCry,3b7usc,Rientcheko,2,Sat Jun 27 15:00:45 2015 UTC,Do you have any ideas about his arm? I've always wondered why it was only his arm that changed. Does having this arm make him not a human?
DevilMayCry,3b7usc,Rientcheko,3,Sat Jun 27 03:26:08 2015 UTC,"The manual or some bit of text mentions that it was a demon attack, and probably pretty recent given the cast and Nero being a combatant.  There's no telling if his arm has stopped 'growing'.  The devil trigger phantom behind him implies a division between Nero and the demon's power in my mind, so I'd say he's more on the lower end of Dante's 'in between' field.    I've always considered the phantom to be Vergil/Vergil's spirit, and that he's using the father/son link he has with Nero to bring himself back into the tangible world, possibly by gradually taking over his body."
DevilMayCry,3b7usc,T_Nartey,2,Sat Jun 27 12:39:13 2015 UTC,"Adding on to theory 3.  As Vergil walks away from fortuna he says ''soon they shall know this devils power'' referring to the eventual arrival of Nero who he believes will have powers much like his own.  Also Nero's arm. You could make the argument that out of Vergil's 4 limbs his right arm is his most valuable, the arm that wields Yamato. And since Nero is 1/4 Demon which out of his 4 limbs would be better then his right arm to be demonic.   The question is why did he make Nero? Was it because the people of fortuna worship Sparda and he graced them with Nero while he was of doing something else? All of this is so weird lol.  Also how did they get Yamato?"
DevilMayCry,3b7usc,T_Nartey,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:13:08 2015 UTC,It's just that we know so little about Vergil's past. Maybe he fell in love with a human for some reason. She might have been killed and that's what made him so cold.
DevilMayCry,3b7usc,T_Nartey,3,Sat Jun 27 15:07:57 2015 UTC,But wasn't the fact that his mother was killed by demons and he hadn't the power to protect her that made him cold? And because of that all what he does is search for more power(the power of his father)?
DevilMayCry,3b7usc,DoveChaser,2,Sat Jun 27 18:36:00 2015 UTC,Yup but imagine if your girlfriend gets killed too... XD Or maybe he just got drunk one night in Fortuna while searching for Sparda's power and got laid.

DevilMayCry,3b76lk,ShadowDonut,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:46:02 2015 UTC,Don't pause at all. If you delay after the second y press you get combo B.
DevilMayCry,3b76lk,Bloodhit,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:17:15 2015 UTC,"Goddamit, it requires to mash button really fast, managed to do it consistently only on keyboard."
DevilMayCry,3b76lk,ColdVergil,3,Sat Jun 27 07:15:16 2015 UTC,Just hold the button
DevilMayCry,3b76lk,Raiden99999,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"I kinda hate the Million Stab in combo A. it requires fast button tapping, like DMC3. I'd usually use the first two combo of combo A, then use the standalone Million Stab [RB + front LS + Y]: first hold the Y, then as the Stinger connects, quickly tap Y to extend the hits. what's more, the standalone Million Stab has more hits compared to combo A Million Stab. and it's easier that way, try it!"
DevilMayCry,3b76lk,LockedAndClush,-1,Sat Jun 27 22:41:50 2015 UTC,"Vergil cannot end Combo A with Million Stabs. You have to go for Stinger instead and hold the button.  EDIT: appears I was wrong. I never could get it (still can't, don't know why), but hey, it's there."
DevilMayCry,3b76lk,Warsc2k,-2,Fri Jun 26 16:55:03 2015 UTC,"he uses the stinger's million stabs, duh~"
DevilMayCry,3b76lk,Warsc2k,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:03:44 2015 UTC,Lol as in everytime i attempt to perform combo A he does not do million stabs and instead goes straight to the Stinger. What I wish to know is how to perform it like how Dante is able to do so in one of his combos where he could perform million stabs before ending it with a Stinger.

DevilMayCry,3b68xh,scionicspectre,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:06:41 2015 UTC,I think they did the right thing by taking it down until it's in a suitable state. It makes the tiny performance losses in DMC 4: SE's default configuration seem entirely negligible by comparison.

Of course, many people said similar things about Nero, despite him having some interesting mechanics.

Itsuno said as much, himself."

DevilMayCry,3b8p1i,Mikolos,2,Fri Jun 26 21:49:29 2015 UTC,"in her future designs she does need moves that allow her to escape, she is a lightning based demon after all -_- she should be able to get away fast, and seeing that she doesn't even use R2 and L2 she could have received something   but I generally love her and adore the fact that she finally made it into the game with her own moveset   but then again she has exactly as many evasive moves as nero"

DevilMayCry,3b8p1i,Blazer-X,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:37:38 2015 UTC,My gripes with her are the same as yours actually. Her style meter build up too slow in contrast to her hard hitting skill. Compare to lady's meter build up speed it's like night and day. She also doesn't have any escape tools save for just jumping out But she's hella fun to play . Lots of combo and if things get too hairy i could aleays whipped out the lazers and BOOM. No more trouble
DevilMayCry,3b5lj1,ColdVergil,9,Fri Jun 26 03:58:16 2015 UTC,"I would prefer if the game stayed offline only with no co-op  but if capcom would like to push for it, then what can I do? I would try it at least, but I expressed my concerns regarding it already  I hope that they will be content with a diverse lengthy main game with more modes than what we currently have, with 5+ playable characters via DLC at least or included in a collector's edition and with a bloody palace creator(like the one in the new doom for the online  stages, you could select the looks of your stage, the enemy waves, the number of stages, the difficulty, the bosses and maybe the timer too) and I would be overjoyed   they honestly don't need to impress me much   decent story, worthy of its predecessors  new enemy designs(meaning interesting abilities) some new weapons some new moves for everyone bloody palace editor"
DevilMayCry,3b5lj1,Mikolos,2,Fri Jun 26 06:39:04 2015 UTC,"But it can stay offline= Singleplayer, so anyone can not worry about it and freak out. This will be extra.  You would go multiplayer or co-op online something like Muti-LDK in which you fight tons and tons of demons with buddys kinda like an MMORPG but DMC style. It could be like custom characters. Or it could just have a different story. It could be like Trine co-op, there are a lot of ways this can be implemented without touching singleplayer/canon story :P I'm sure Capcom would approach with the right way.  It could also be Story mode(regular so far) Co-op mode(online or local) where you can play another extra story, something like Lady/Trish aside from Vergil/Dante main one, just a story to have fun.  It could be something like, I don't know if you're familiar with a game called Chaos Legion. The game had SHIT TONS of hordes of enemies and the bosses were REAL HARD. I think a mix up of this enemies and DMC characters with co-op would fit pretty awesomely."
DevilMayCry,3b5lj1,Mikolos,2,Fri Jun 26 07:12:22 2015 UTC,"I would only be okay-ish with co-op if it doubled or tripled the enemy's health and increased their knockdown resistance by at least 75%, without it it would be a juggle fest, bosses would need 5 times the health and 200% resistance increase at least to maintain the design of the game, but the camera, the draw distances etc would take a hit from this anyway  my greatest fear is if they approach from the get go with co-op, then it will be in their mind the whole time and they would design the game around it, and it would be inevitable. as soon as you add something like co-op even just in theory to the game, everything instantly changes and the design choices would be different, thus we would once again get a halfbaked game  they only need to make one good game, and co-op would ruin it, not because i don't want you or anyone else to play a thousand hours with your friends online, but because we expect this game to be something. to build on the foundations of dmc4 not ground zeroing it again"

I think they'd know how to approach co-op. Let's take for example 4 SE. They released a buch of DLC's in which you get super dante, blue orbs or everything unlocked. Yes it cost money BUT everything can be unlocked just by playing. This was a nice move from them.  Now for co-op take for example Borderlands. Game-story is not designed to be co-op but anyone you want can join the game and help you. I know Capcom at least gives a shit about the story because, let's take Nero for example, they avoid any question about  his origins yet they try to tease it a lot. They surely wouldn't want their story to be broken by some crappy co-op, they learned about what happened with DmC(I hope) but eitherway they seem to care a lot about the story. Besides they wouldn't make a co-op game without our feedback, they would probably in some way try to get info and then decide what to do."

DevilMayCry,3b5lj1,scionicspectre,3,Fri Jun 26 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"Well, they did the same thing in DMC 3: SE and that game actually had co-op to an extent via Doppleganger and the Arkham battle.  I'm not really reading into it too much, but it certainly seems feasible without even changing the characters much. They just need to decide how to balance the additional firepower. I mean, it could even be that you don't balance it and it's just an option that makes the game easier by adding an equally powerful buddy. The game does have super-easy difficulty settings and automatic mode, after all."

I finished legendary dark knight mode mission 20 in 1 minute and unlocked bloody palace.

Note that Lady and Trish actually have separate credits fights for their costume unlocks, which one you get is determined by what rank you beat the final boss with. B or lower = Trish, A or higher = Lady.  In terms of getting the kills in time, don't worry about being stylish. Just spam the most OP moves you can find."

You can't change how the weapon-switching works, it's just a built-in part of the game you'll have to become familiar with. The game is built around switching weapons this way so, after some practice, it should be easier to memorize and get a handle on.  This series has never been very big on allowing that depth of configuration. Changing the controls per-character is about as far as it goes. I don't even recall anyone making a mod to do this in the original."
DevilMayCry,3b2z49,BadNewBearer,6,Thu Jun 25 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"both of them are very hard hitters and you can combo with them surprisingly well, and to me the most important thing about them is that they have a CONCEPT which was designed following the tracks of their individual characteristics, and these concepts were in the end designed and executed well in gameplay, despite the short development time, hence the lot of reused moves, but they still got some unique stuff  if they make it into the next game, and I hope they'll do at least as DLC, then it would be great if they were revisited and got some more unique moves and weapons"
DevilMayCry,3b2z49,Mikolos,3,Thu Jun 25 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"I actually tend to get up close with Lady as much as possible. I just use long-ranged tactics in between combos to keep the hits going so I'm not constantly jumping or mid-air grappling toward enemies. I love Lady's gameplay, if I'm being honest, because there's so much room to experiment in-between close and long range tactics.  With Lady, I think a lot of people just try to do a boring long-ranged game where they hold back too much because her melee is slower and needs to be well-timed. My number one tip would be not to fear grappling or grenades (R1+Back+Triangle). They can reshuffle enemies enough to open completely new combo opportunities.  So far as Trish goes, she's awesome. I have no complaints since there are countless setup varieties and throwing out Sparda to change your moveset is a breeze. My only complaint is that sometimes it's too easy to kill enemies quickly and if you're not on LDK this means lower style rankings unless you hold back and try some weaker single-target combos. Not a big deal, though, since that's the case for most characters."
DevilMayCry,3b2z49,scionicspectre,2,Thu Jun 25 17:57:15 2015 UTC,"Lady is my new favorite character (not that I haven't always loved her, but now that's she's playable I'm head over heels!).   I've changed her controls so that DT is on square, shoot is on R1 and lock on is on L1, and I play her as if she were a charge character in a fighting game.   For those unfamiliar, what I mean is that if I'm not firing off level 3 shotgun blasts, I'm holding down the charge button, biding my time with some melee or grapple attacks. It's really fucking fun, especially in LDK mode.   Trish is fun too, but I find myself just throwing out round trip, then going ham, rinse and repeat as needed."
DevilMayCry,3b2z49,shizzy1427,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:28:36 2015 UTC,"same for me. I switch all the character shoot buttons to either r2 or l2 to charge while doing close combat work on the enemy, except for vergril which you don't have to use charge shoot for long . for trish, i think that will happens in most occasion, since roundtrip don't have charge up time like with dante or vergil and it will keeps the enemy occupided for quite a while you're doing works"
DevilMayCry,3b4igc,NiiGGZ,3,Thu Jun 25 22:15:01 2015 UTC,"This is likely because the game autosaves when you die, when you complete a mission, when you start a new mission, and after you leave the power-up menu. I suppose it's trying to prevent you from doing something that could change the data that needs to be saved, thereby corrupting the save file.

Really hard to get into her long range mostly playstyle and keep distance when you've been swinging swords through out the series . Trish is ... a mix bag of all that is in devil may cry 4(save for nero).  But she's hella fun to play though.
DevilMayCry,3b2whb,gekimayu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:19:56 2015 UTC,"I kinda like and hate trish, I like her for her great fun moves like the thunder bayblade or 1932039 drives she is shooting but I hate her lack of mobility and defensive options  edit: And I hate her guns, but the laser is hella fun and broken :D"
DevilMayCry,3b2whb,kappasphere,5,Thu Jun 25 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"I still haven't got to Trish either just because I hate playing Lady. She is the epitome of kite if you're not jump-cancelling over everyone like a cheap bastard.  If you love being mobile you will almost never take out your Kalina Ann because anything that's worth doing with it requires you to stand still unless you're going for an uncharged shot. A lot of her style attacks are very hard to cancel, and her charge attacks are basically where it's at.  In short, I'm just really disappointed. I was hoping to see her more agile like in DMC3 cutscenes and using more of her Kalina Ann to melee, heck I'd appreciate it if she actually had bullet rain (the gunslinger pistol style in the air) rather than the pseudo-devilbringer.  I'd appreciate a ranged character, but I really don't appreciate stationary ranged nukers. For the record I loved her dual guns but I found her shotgun to literally be (upgraded) DMC3 shotgun while Kalina Ann is Kalina Ann.  I liked that her Air Hike was a ridiculous Kalina Ann shot to the ground that damages, that was great.  edit: honestly I'd rather have the sniper rifle Dante got in DMC3. Spamming that alone (animation-cancelling) was fucking great.    edit2: after reading some let me emphasize some things.  This character is designed to have super strong guns. Going balls out melee with her painfully limited melee arsenal is pretty much trying to mold her into your playstyle. There is a reason why her charged shots are so strong and her Kalina Ann has a fucking kiting move (back+triangle) whereas for everyone else it's a launcher.  This webm is a good example  here's more"
DevilMayCry,3b2whb,scionicspectre,7,Thu Jun 25 17:09:01 2015 UTC,"Just try to get creative with her and use more moves that get you around the stage quicker and you'll find ways to have fun. I think it's all about learning how to coalesce the timing between her moves, but you're right that it's very easy for her to be boring (especially if you just spam the charged shotgun for massive unearned damage/style).  I actually use a more upclose and melee focused style with her just because the grapple and her aerial combos can get some satisfying results when they're started with grenades or end in some well-timed gunfire. She can use inertia to move toward opponents in the air if you use multiple grapples.  But yeah, given the variety of characters and play styles in this game, we're all bound to find one character that we don't quite like compared to the others. If Lady's really not your groove there's no harm in leaving her only for mission completion trophies."
DevilMayCry,3b2whb,Chaotix247,3,Thu Jun 25 17:45:53 2015 UTC,I don't like Trish at all.  Would have made more sense to flesh out her fists and Sword as two separate Devil arms.  She's so awkward.  Now Lady is a ton of fun.  She's hard to use and I love it.  I love her combat capability and even though I've yet to get past Berial I've had a blast trying each time.
DevilMayCry,3b2whb,Entreric,3,Thu Jun 25 17:19:21 2015 UTC,Lady is the easiest character by far. Level 3 charge for days and instant sss
DevilMayCry,3b2whb,ColdVergil,0,Thu Jun 25 23:59:19 2015 UTC,Easy doesn't always mean fun
DevilMayCry,3b2whb,ColdVergil,6,Fri Jun 26 07:26:23 2015 UTC,Why you can't stand her? She is basically a ranged Nero. The thing is that she really needs to switch weps a lot. Or you just can spamm her lvl 3 charged shotgun. I found her really fun
DevilMayCry,3b2whb,ColdVergil,2,Thu Jun 25 15:58:35 2015 UTC,"Well I did say why I couldn't stand her ;) I don't like her style, and her moves seems slow. I don't like her weapons either. I'll try her again tomorrow, but I doubt my opinion will change. It might tho!"
DevilMayCry,3b2whb,Raiden99999,2,Thu Jun 25 16:42:04 2015 UTC,Cmon! She's fun :P

DevilMayCry,3b4d1j,Azran15,2,Thu Jun 25 21:33:26 2015 UTC,"The only thing you need unlock for the new characters are moves.  Proud Souls and Health is shared across all five characters so if you play Nero and Dante's campaign first to acquire all the weapons and blue orbs, you should have the proud souls for most of the moveset of the other 3 characters."
DevilMayCry,3b4d1j,sujinjian,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:38:11 2015 UTC,"I think the character swap fucks with the exact number of Proud Souls: Danto, Nero, and the other three have completely different amounts of Proud Souls."
DevilMayCry,3b4d1j,sujinjian,2,Thu Jun 25 22:36:06 2015 UTC,Well each character's moves cost a different amount and each character has a different amount of moves to buy total. Couple that with DMC4's system in which a move's price goes up depending on how many you've already bought and you're bound to see difference in each character's proud soul count.
DevilMayCry,3b4d1j,ColdVergil,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:44:42 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, that makes sense. So for example, Nero gets the Hold and Snatch thing later on. There's no unlockable equivalent for Lady or Vergil, correct? If so, neat!"

Might not hurt to learn the techniques with Dante, though.  Is it possible to get to the debug area to practice combos in SE? And what do you mean by ""broken"" Trick spam?"
DevilMayCry,3b1p75,deesh8,2,Thu Jun 25 07:48:44 2015 UTC,"If you get your mechanics with Dante up to scratch it'll make you a better player overall. AFAIK there is no debug area in SE yet, but I think someone's made a potential anti-trainer so you could have a practice dummy. By 'broken' I mean ridiculously op; Trick will cancel almost everything, if not, everything. And if you have a sword in an enemy you can Trick to it endlessly, which kind of destroys the need to jump cancel at all on Vergil. Just try spamming Trick on an enemy and you'll see haha"

DevilMayCry,3b229s,kappasphere,3,Thu Jun 25 17:04:55 2015 UTC,SE is not as well optimized as Vanilla.
DevilMayCry,3b229s,Kityraz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:36:56 2015 UTC,"Because it's new man, what did ya expect? I see a lot of people bitching about this but how can you expect an optimized game for next gen to run on the same system you had... Sorry for sound a little harsh but i'm tired of seeing everyone bitching about it.  Either way gameplay is still smooth, for me at least i get 50-60 fps."
DevilMayCry,3b229s,ColdVergil,-1,Thu Jun 25 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"There is no actually graphical improvements, there are some texture upgrades, and motion blur, but thats about it. People expected to play the game as they could on a shitty PC.Its a same game after-all, graphics were pretty good."
DevilMayCry,3b229s,ColdVergil,7,Thu Jun 25 15:34:13 2015 UTC,And texture upgrades are not a graphical improvement? You're contradicting yourself. I got 17 hours of gameplay now on SE and I found it way more cool than the old one.
DevilMayCry,3b229s,scionicspectre,4,Thu Jun 25 16:17:38 2015 UTC,"Those aren't the only improvements, of course, but I think people don't really care about most of the improvements as they don't seem all that noticeable or important to have if the cost is a framerate under 60 FPS.  I'm sure we'll find a way to turn off all these settings and maybe even revert to the DX9 version of MT in the coming months, so I don't think people with weaker video cards will be left out in the cold for long. That's part of why I'm sick of the whining- we knew this could happen, and the game is actually really well optimized by modern standards.  If you've been playing any recent PC games at 60 FPS other than DMC 4 vanilla, this game should run fine. I would hope that people have broader interests than one beloved franchise if they insist on PC as a platform. Even still, from a philosophical standpoint, I think we'd all like the game to run similarly to the original if the graphical improvements aren't immediately noticeable."
DevilMayCry,3b229s,ColdVergil,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:02:38 2015 UTC,I know they are not the only improvements but damn I'm sick of people saying ''bad port sucks blablabla I whine'' kind of stuff when it's actually a pretty good port.
DevilMayCry,3b229s,scionicspectre,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:09:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a big difference between a bad port and a desire to play a remaster on less powerful hardware. A lot of people would rather complain and accuse Capcom of laziness than face the fact that they may need to purchase a new video card or possibly a new console.  I can't blame them for being upset- it was bound to happen since DMC 4 was already one of the best optimized PC games of all time. The comparison isn't to what is reasonable, but to the unreasonably efficient original."

DevilMayCry,3b142t,kaboxx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:21:19 2015 UTC,"Using a DualShock 2 controller as well, I use this on all the characters:  Jump - R2 Change weapon - X Shoot - L1 DT - Square  Having jump on R2 makes jump cancelling a lot easier and comfortable IMO. L1 means it's easier to charge gun attacks while doing other attacks."
DevilMayCry,3b142t,deesh8,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:39:11 2015 UTC,"I play with default controls. I have my thumb on square and index finger on triangle. I don't have trouble jump-cancelling while charging my weapon (unlike bunny-hopping in CS, you don't really need to spam jump in DMC); the tip of my thumb holds square, the limb presses X. My middle finger holds R1 and my ring finger is on the weapon slot. Obviously with Nero you don't have an R2 button so I could map the revving to R2 if I wanted to make use of this.  I got used to this control scheme because I tried doing a guns-only fight on DMC3.  I don't know if I'm going to consider moving the Style button somewhere since swapping between triangle and circle with my index finger in this setup is a bit of a pain, but otherwise for me it works fine.  Unfortunately I'm using an Xbox360 controller and throughout all these years I still hate it compared to a PS controller. The other huge problem with the Xbox controller for me is because the analog stick is so close to the left trigger buttons, I can only have 1 finger on the trigger buttons so I can have accurate movement on the analog stick. Also the plateau on top of analog stick is retarded and isn't 'ergonomic'.  I'm going to buy a PS4 controller just because of DMC4 soon."
DevilMayCry,3b142t,kappasphere,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"Default. Works well on Dante and Vergil. But the main problem comes when I need to charge up Nero or Lady's guns. I can jump and use melee, but I dont have an extra finger dedicated to buster or grappling hook/special moves."

Well Capcom if this isn't incentive enough for DMC 5...  EDIT; We still need data from:   Xbox One(Japan) PS4(US and UK) Xbox One (US and UK) Not sure from where else data is taken but this ones should be the primary   From what I have been reading and searching in the UK it might have sold a lot.

Funny story, I just got random adds on Steam from people asking me if the game was good due to a review I made on the store page lol  It's not going to sell 3 millions or so but Capcom sure wants to know if it has some fanbase still. They as a company should know that a lot of people are not going to buy it because it's the same. That's okay. They just need a little incentive which is that survey they sent out on the copies over Japan. All we have to do is believe in Japanese fanbase and try to give our feedback somehow as well.  If it reaches some good feedback, they're gonna go green light on DMC 5 and it surely will sell again 4 millions. I think it's enough incentive.

Capcom might just be testing the waters with this and I don't mind giving them a couple of bucks if that means we will get a DMC5 - a 'true' sequel. DmC had a fun approach regarding the story but the combat was goddamn awful, I couldn't even bother with replaying it. And years later they release a 60 fps version afterall that should've been a free DLC to show the Original fans who were willing to participate in that 'experiment' a little gratitude.. but I can see the DLC scaring off new fans who would rather grab DmC for 7 bucks and get everything.  Well, anyway. SE runs as well as DMC4 did on the same rig I used back then. There's Vergil for even more brutal combat performances. I love it, money is definitely deserved. Especially since I'm paying for possibly hundreds of hours of gameplay.  /On behalf of every adrenaline junkie ever.  Also, there really needs to be more exposure.

DevilMayCry,3b0uvt,SuperfluousMoniker,3,Thu Jun 25 01:48:52 2015 UTC,When I used to fight him as Nero I would just dodge every charge attack. After 3 or 4 in a row he stops momentarily and you have time to get in enough damage to break his guard and ragdoll him. It might be the same for Lady if I'm picturing the situation right. It helps to DT to get in enough damage when the time comes.
DevilMayCry,3b0uvt,Rhaegar_ii,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:10:16 2015 UTC,I tried to do that on my last attempt but I screwed it up and now I'm so far on tilt that I need to take a break.

DevilMayCry,3b0uvt,ComboBr34k3r,2,Thu Jun 25 02:18:43 2015 UTC,"Save your L1 attack and try to keep your back to a wall, he'll charge 5 times. On the fifth charge dodge and then get in close and do as much damage as possible."

It might be possible to do it on the earlier charges, but after so many attempts I wasn't taking chances."

DevilMayCry,3b18to,ComboBr34k3r,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:11:29 2015 UTC,"The main control scheme issues most people have with doing Rising star (or upper slash 2) is that they are unknowingly double tapping attack and only holding the second time.

DevilMayCry,3b0o2p,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"I'd consider swapping melee and the style button so you can fan between jump and melee.

When I do JC, I sometimes end up using Trick to cancel because it's so broken. As for hitting the wrong button, rebinding might help. Put Jump on R2 and change weapon on X. Most enemies you should be level with them to jump cancel though, but I think scarecrows and mega scarecrows require you to be a bit above them?"
DevilMayCry,3b011d,burning_gundam,3,Wed Jun 24 21:44:29 2015 UTC,Dante's and Vergil's million stabs only require you to hold the button to start.
DevilMayCry,3b011d,Dreceratops,3,Wed Jun 24 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on the target and difficulty, Stinger won't always send things flying IIRC (It's been a while since I've played Dante on DMC4). I think the MS input is to just hold triangle after a Stinger then mash it (you may be able to hold it to prolong duration of MS), or it's hold triangle mid Stinger. Best thing to do is check the skill list.  Best type of Lock-On is subjective, but Type 1 should give you the most control if you use it properly. AFAIK there is no toggle for Lock-On, but it's on R1 which is handy and not too hard to hold down.   Not sure about RG though, I think I read somewhere about the maximum gauge size being reduced? But yeah, RG in DMC4 feels a bit weaker compared to that in DMC3, probably because you have access to all 4/5 styles."

DevilMayCry,3azm9e,Mikolos,2,Wed Jun 24 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"Turbo greatly increases my enjoyment of the series, and the ""combo scene"" uses it exclusively. In fact, I was so used to it being my default, I haven't actually checked to see if I turned it on.  edit: I played through Vergil's campaign with it off. Time to relearn all the timings."
DevilMayCry,3azm9e,Dreceratops,2,Wed Jun 24 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"Most people use it once they get familiar with the playable characters and enemy moves. If you've been playing the game for a long time, the usual speed of the game starts to feel slow since you have a heightened sense of awareness compared to a new player.  Of course, new players may as well give it a shot if they want an additional challenge."

DevilMayCry,3azm9e,Raiden99999,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:10:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on how good you are at reading enemy attacks. Granted, part of the problem with switching is that all your previous timing will get thrown off. Which is a problem when at least 2 of your characters uses just charge."
DevilMayCry,3b03h3,SuicidalPony,8,Wed Jun 24 22:03:02 2015 UTC,"Dante and Nero first, no matter what. Their game is the only one with a story that is on going - it introduces the bosses, the characters and the environments. The other characters are bonus and should come after."
DevilMayCry,3b03h3,ThePurpleGhost,6,Wed Jun 24 22:23:55 2015 UTC,"If you haven't played the game before, Dante/Nero contains the game's actual story.  Vergil and Lady/Trish have only two cutscenes each- one before playing the campaign, one after. Chronologically, Vergil's scenes are before DMC 4's main story, while Lady and Trish have cutscenes within the game's main story- more of a spin on what we've already seen.  So if you care a lot about which order you see the cutscenes, I'd do Vergil, Dante/Nero, then Lady/Trish. Otherwise, just play Dante/Nero for the main story and the other two campaigns for some very light cutscenes."

The part in the beginning of the mission where you need go go up the cavern is annoying too, especially if you want to get the blue orb at the very top. This is trivial as Nero, but frustrating as all hell as Vergil."

It includes the entirety of original DMC4, three new characters (without story and just playing through the same missions, but completely different gameplay-wise), improved graphics and some minor additions like costumes and colors.   Basically if you want new story content, this is not for you. But if you want to have some fun enjoying new and interesting characters on DMC4 engine, then buy it right now."
DevilMayCry,3axlju,LockedAndClush,0,Wed Jun 24 09:13:36 2015 UTC,I have never played any DMC games before besides the new one which I fucking loved. So If i buy this is it the original DMC 4 story or changed up?
DevilMayCry,3axlju,TheMightyMrPlow,9,Wed Jun 24 09:35:42 2015 UTC,"As his comment says, it's the original DMC4 story. The ONLY change is that you can choose to go through it as different characters. It is the original DMC4 storyline, though."
DevilMayCry,3axlju,TheMightyMrPlow,3,Wed Jun 24 09:41:31 2015 UTC,"Im sorry for the noobie coments but in DMC 4 you play as nero right? So in this new one you can play as Virgil and a few others, but how does it work? Like does the nero just get replaced or is there different storys"
DevilMayCry,3axlju,VolatileCurry,10,Wed Jun 24 09:47:41 2015 UTC,"Dude, it's totally fine!   Okay so in DMC4 the two main characters are Nero and Dante. You mostly play as Nero. You switch between playing Nero and Dante a bit through the game.  When you launch the Special Edition, you get to choose from three choices.   Nero/Dante - Play through the story exactly the same as DMC4, no changes.   Vergil - You're just Vergil playing through the same story as above. In all scenarios, you're Vergil.   Lady/Trish - When you would normally play as Nero, you play as Lady. When you would normally play as Dante, you play as Trish.   I hope that clears up your confusion, man."
DevilMayCry,3axlju,LockedAndClush,2,Wed Jun 24 09:51:01 2015 UTC,"To expand on this, you select who you want to start the game as, and play through from there as your chosen character(s).

DevilMayCry,3axr7a,dtaylor1243,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:16:30 2015 UTC,Try actually using his roll to side step. It gives enough time to get a few good hits. Vergil can easily nullify his ranged works so just get openings and chip away.
DevilMayCry,3axr7a,Entreric,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:38:06 2015 UTC,"Doesnt Rapid Slash place you behind the enemy? Shouldnt you be able to dodge all his attacks by just using it in the right moment?   If not then just spam SS skills until your DT gauge is full and dance around him. Dodging as DT'd Vergil is a piece of cake.   Also, trying to break the shield as Vergil is pointless, Nero can only do it because DB cant be parried just like Dantes Yamato since its technically not a weapon.   Oh, also try to parry his lances instead of interrupting him, since they spawn health orbs."

However, you're not really losing anything if you get the Japanese version. You get Drink it Down and Japanese voice actors, which are absent from the western release.

DevilMayCry,3ax7r2,quangdn295,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:55:05 2015 UTC,You just need to get used to it =) you can cycle through beowulf and yamato back and back since your L2/R2(RB/LB even tho i use a xbox controller I always use L2/R2 to refere to the back buttons) both switch in different directions so its easier to stay at 2 weapons.

DevilMayCry,3axke4,l0stinthought,5,Wed Jun 24 18:04:14 2015 UTC,Which attacks have the most lag? Performing Air-Trick in the middle of ending lag cancels most moves.
DevilMayCry,3axke4,Dreceratops,2,Wed Jun 24 08:50:35 2015 UTC,"If you wait a while after attacking with Yamato, Vergil will automatically trigger the sheathing animation. The only reliable way to cancel these is to do Air Trick (and hit something with it, of course), I'm not sure (haven't played enough yet) if switching weapons also would let you move. Just don't delay between attacks and go straight to the next attack or Trick."
DevilMayCry,3axke4,LockedAndClush,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:11:15 2015 UTC,"Switching weapons doesn't change the lag. You could cancel with a judgement cut, or more quickly with a just judgement cut, but it's not as reliable."

The mass is sometimes termed a Missa brevis et solemnis, because it is short in a simple structure as a Missa brevis, but festively scored like a Missa solemnis with brass and timpani in addition to four solists, strings and organ. It was possibly first performed on 7 April 1776 in a mass for Easter at the Salzburg Cathedral. The nickname is derived from violin figures in the Hosanna which resemble bird chirping.

I doubt you would be able to play the original and not this one (there doesn't seem to be much in the way of graphical improvements), so something is definitely wrong (with the game or your hardware/settings). As always, one must ask: are your drivers all updated? Also, there's the fact that the game seems to be DirectX10 only instead of having versions both for 9 and 10, so that might be making some difference."

DevilMayCry,3auuj6,ShiftyAxel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"solid vsync'd 60   Yuck. I'd recommend you turn that off for responsive controls. V-sync buffers a lot of frames and introduces huge input lag. Not something you want in a game like this. Compare the two of them by playing either for about an hour, you'll see."
DevilMayCry,3auuj6,UnmannedSurveillance,3,Tue Jun 23 21:23:14 2015 UTC,"You're being kind of presumptuous there.  Through virtue of being a graphics programmer, I'm quite aware of both the tech behind VSync and its implications on input. I choose to use it because I simply can't deal with screen tearing, even if it means adapting my muscle memory to compensate for minor input lag."
DevilMayCry,3auuj6,ShiftyAxel,2,Tue Jun 23 22:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yes I was presumptuous because I've been asked ""Why"" so many times after mentioning it's a good idea to turn off v-sync for action games. Thought I'd save time.   adapting my muscle memory to compensate for minor input lag   Aha. Not really possibly, actually. You can buffer attacks and predict them (which is just a direct gameplay element), but you're still now playing with more input lag that's not really possible to compensate for. You can get used to it which is different. But you'll never have that responsiveness back. Your reaction speed and timing skill now has a limit that's not your own. Just a little something I can't stand so I thought I'd help a bro out. But you seem fine with it :)  That said, I find different monitors tear more than others. The one I'm using now gets essentially no tearing on most games. I think there's 3 games I've ever seen it tear on. I think it's to do with 120Hz. Super responsive AND no tearing. Love it."

When I said 'compensate for', I did indeed mean it in the 'get used to' context. I don't think there's a person on this planet that has conscious control over their muscle memory to that extent :P  And yeah, the 120Hz will definitely do it. The GPU is able to push 2x more completed frames to the monitor per second, so providing your card is up to the task, it should effectively cut tearing issues in half (no pun intended.)

Even mid-low-tier gamign rigs should be able to handle DMC4 @ 120-144 as long as you don't turn on too much post-processing like AA. 1080p max base settings, maybe a little bit of AF, you're shooting for triple digits definitely if you have an any way modern rig. Even if you don't, you could always go for medium settings and zero post processing. DMC4 is one of the most beautiful and best-performing video games on the market to date. It still holds up visually in my opinion. Even the PS3 version is nice to look at and @60fps. Really puts modern games to shame.   Bring on standardized G-Sync so we don't have to worry about this crap anymore!   No thanks. I'm actually really angry at Nvidia and their proprietary garbage right now. I have a NV GPU but they've messed up too many games with their crappy and mind-numbingly pointless 'gameworks'. The less I see of their crap the better.  Improve the monitors and game performance even more and we won't need any more software to step in to handle tearing. And if we do, make it open-source and standard in hardware."

Eitherway it's not like he is overpowered by itself because you can't just press buttons and wins. It's you, the player that makes him good. If you go and mash buttons you're not gonna get far. This is the best thing they could do and i'm honestly really happy about it.   You're just assuming that everyone is extremely awesome playing this game. And it's not like he is entirely overpowered, just as you state:    each advantage vergil had, was balanced or negated by a disadvantage,   Isn't that good?

DevilMayCry,3aumod,ShiftyAxel,6,Tue Jun 23 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"I'll start with mine:   The overall graphical quality does seem to have improved. Higher-res textures, more post-process lighting effects, etc. Looking good. The graphical options have been renamed, though it looks like the amount of settings is pretty similar to vanilla. The game no longer supports 16:10 resolutions. I can select 1920*1200 as I could with vanilla, but it now renders letterboxed instead of full-screen. Anti-aliasing options above 8x have been removed. Vanilla supported several more intensive types of anti-aliasing, such as 16x and 16xQ. Various post-processing effects such as Motion Blur, Depth-of-Field Blur, Light Shafts and Bloom are enabled at all times. This greatly inflates the base system requirements for the game, and forces some users (such as myself) to live with certain effects that they would rather disable. The red door transition effect is noticeably lower-quality than it was in vanilla. It looks like the game uses a lower-resolution framebuffer to capture the screen before applying the distortion effect. The mouse doesn't get hidden when using a gamepad. The game now handles alt-tabbing very poorly, causing the game window to float over the desktop and obscure all other windows.   All-in-all, I was expecting much worse after the disaster that was RE5 Gold / Steamworks. I'm pissed that Capcom saw fit to downgrade certain aspects of the game when vanilla did them just fine, but outside of these specific gripes I'm liking it a lot.  I'm sure that fixing some of the issues will be as simple as a config file edit, such as the motion blur, antialiasing and possibly resolution. We shall see, and hopefully Capcom will patch in proper support at a later date. If anyone's had experience messing with MT Framework configs before, I could use your knowledge!  Edit: I fiddled around with the config file, but using settings from other MTF games (RE Revelations 1/2, DMC4 Vanilla) didn't change anything. For reference, I tried setting MotionBlur=FALSE and AspectRatio=16:10. No bueno."
DevilMayCry,3aumod,Txontirea,3,Tue Jun 23 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"The solution to the alt-tabbing problem is just to hold down alt and press enter when you want to alt-tab.

DevilMayCry,3auwzz,goddamn_owl,7,Tue Jun 23 18:30:43 2015 UTC,"On the final /r/DevilMayCry stream last night, I defeated over 99 demons, but that's where the counter capped off and the ending stated I killed 99+ enemies specifically. The bonus art had an additional phrase to reward me. ""Thanks for playing. Until we meet again...?"" So yeah, no secret ending, at least not for Vergil.  http://www.twitch.tv/scionicspectre/b/671639303 It's around the 1:13:00 mark."

DevilMayCry,3auwzz,gekimayu,0,Wed Jun 24 15:27:52 2015 UTC,The whole thing of vergil beeing there makes no sense. I mean isn't vergil supposed to be dead? Since mundus took his soul and created nelo angelo who then died after fighting dante? Also how did Agnus and co get yamato. So many questions I can't find answers to =(
DevilMayCry,3auwzz,DeusNasu,2,Wed Jun 24 15:34:19 2015 UTC,"It was already stated that Vergil on Fortuna happened around 10 years before DMC3. For playability purposes he got an updated appearance and moveset, Force Edge and Beowulf, while the campaign per se was only Vergil running around the place. All in all, you should not think about the enemies you encounter on the story: Vergil on Fortuna is just an excuse to have him playable on an updated version (that might as well be called his definitive version see what i did there hurr hurr)  Maybe now that the game has the capability of DLC, CAPCOM May Patch those holes, although I see that unlikely considering it is CAPCOM we are talking about."

I assume you aren't actually requesting this feature here, as there are multiple modding forums like InfernalWorks that would be more suited to that request.  Also, Vergil can trick 'over' now in DT, not just down or back, so that's a nice addition that's probably too OP for continual use. I mean, his teleport is already insanely OP as a defensive option."

If it's someone like Donguri's combo videos or something like that, I think it's fine to post it on the front page since they're unlikely to come in here and do it themselves (and they're unlikely to spam us continually).  Either way, if a lot of people have questions about this we should probably open a separate discussion thread as this thread is primarily for submissions and reactions to those submissions."

DevilMayCry,3atwms,Regalian,2,Tue Jun 23 17:23:55 2015 UTC,I can use my dedicated GTX660m graphics card. However the game always stops working when I select the PC setting option in the main menu.

DevilMayCry,3atwms,LonaQQ,-4,Tue Jun 23 15:52:00 2015 UTC,I agree but that's not essentially a nine year old PC game that should run at 200fps at 4k for a 290x.
DevilMayCry,3atwms,Txontirea,-3,Tue Jun 23 15:55:23 2015 UTC,And I did say that correctly. A 980 gets between 180-300 fps at 4k in these benchmarks that a 290x is getting 70-120fps at 1080p.
DevilMayCry,3atwms,KawaiiNin,2,Tue Jun 23 16:01:29 2015 UTC,Strongly dissagree with this post. Dual Core 2.2 GHz with GTX 750Ti running 50-60 fps smoothly.
DevilMayCry,3atwms,quangdn295,-1,Tue Jun 23 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"A 750ti would be getting well over 120fps at 1440p in the normal DMC4 edition that also looks better. There's nothing you can disagree with, the game runs worse."
DevilMayCry,3atwms,Nzy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:58:25 2015 UTC,So a game with everything improved to next gen runs slower on older machines. Oh boy how could no one saw that coming...

DevilMayCry,3atwms,McShizzL,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:13:32 2015 UTC,the blurring comes from MSAA setting. Keep that low and you'll be fine. I kinda like it because it reminds me of DMC3

DevilMayCry,3ar75c,Phantom_XIII,6,Mon Jun 22 21:14:26 2015 UTC,"I believe it's because DMC4 happens before DMC2, which means Lucia would have little to no place in the story itself. Lady and Trish were already in the story, except not playable. Vergil is one of the ""three main characters"" if you ask me, and also a fan favorite.   Also, he's theorized to be Nero's father, so including him in the game would be pretty much obligatory, and also, Special Edition Traditiontm !"

DevilMayCry,3ap29g,scionicspectre,2,Mon Jun 22 16:11:09 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure how it works in most cases. The last one I waited until midnight for was Skyrim and it released at midnight in my timezone. Skyrim had a much larger fanbase though so that could have just been a marketing thing.

DevilMayCry,3alm1l,LockedAndClush,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:27:16 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell it's just the Red Orb and Proud Soul rates and Speed that changes. I'll have to take a more comprehensive look later today, but I don't think the balance changes apply to anyone's combat or the enemies.  They've already told us multiple times that it doesn't refer to what you would typically consider 'balance' in say, a fighting game. I'm also glad they decided to retain the original game settings just in case someone wants to know what it was like for us back in 2008."
DevilMayCry,3alm1l,scionicspectre,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:05:53 2015 UTC,Can you still play as the new characters with the old balance?
DevilMayCry,3alm1l,caboosethedestroyer,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:13:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely certain, as I didn't use the original settings. It seems like using the old settings requires you to delete your gamesave as there is only one now.  It would be silly to rip three characters out for that mode, however, so I assume you can play as all 5. I'll find out when the PC version comes out since I can just copy the gamesave file, but I doubt you'll need me to verify at that point."
DevilMayCry,3alm1l,scionicspectre,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:20:32 2015 UTC,Yes. Just enter the code at the title screen then start the game normally.

DevilMayCry,3alm1l,lostgilgamesh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think you keep the orbs/souls you got if you have a previous version of the game, but the Proud Souls and Red Orbs do accrue much faster in Special Edition than with the 'original settings'.  It should only take you a couple hours to get all you need for every character."

DevilMayCry,3aihk2,NiiGGZ,-2,Sat Jun 20 15:13:57 2015 UTC,sigh. Looks like we're going to have to mod Kari Wahlgren back in. I don't get it... how did they go from having her DMC3>DMC4 but not 4>SE. CAPCOM... you're really discouraging me from even getting this special edition at all any more. I'm seriously considering skipping it at this point. To make original Lady costume a pre order bonus and have her original VA gone... pushing it. Pushing it big time.
DevilMayCry,3aihk2,azureknightmare,9,Sat Jun 20 15:29:55 2015 UTC,"What if she declined do to schedule complications or just couldn't do it?

Have you even seen DmC? And my points about the DLC are still valid. That alone shows they're pretty disconnected from what the fans have been asking for. As far as I'm concerned, CAPCOM is on thin ice and this kind of suspicion is justified. Unless you need another DmC to get it through one's head of how disconnected they are."
DevilMayCry,3aihk2,ShiroKaito,5,Sat Jun 20 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"DMC4 SE was on a very tight schedule and budget, and it's possible they just couldn't work something out.

DevilMayCry,3aihk2,chronichicken,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:07:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah because she'd totally just turn down money for re-using her voice in the same game.   Okay. Let's say she agreed to have her voice reused for SE, what about the voicing for the gameplay assets? They have her voice for cutscenes sure, but what about sounds of her fighting? Taunting? Dying?   They have none of that, if anything, the best they could do is rehash compressed PS2 voicing from the 10 year old DMC3 and I know for a fact that if you're complaining about a voice actor, you'd complain about them reusing old compressed voices. If it really bothers you to the point where you're thinking about not getting the game, then don't get it.   But you honestly think it's out of reasonable doubt that they made this decision? Have you even seen DmC? And my points about the DLC are still valid. That alone shows they're pretty disconnected from what the fans have been asking for. As far as I'm concerned, CAPCOM is on thin ice and this kind of suspicion is justified. Unless you need another DmC to get it through one's head of how disconnected they are.   As far as I am aware and anyone please correct me if I'm wrong, as irrelevant as it is: CAPCOM are the publisher, meaning that they are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing; not development, take that up with Ninja Theory and the DLC point isn't really valid as a skin is a skin, it doesn't necessitate that they use the same VA, that's like saying Drew Coombs should have voiced the DMC1 skin in DmC."

DevilMayCry,3agd8r,caboosethedestroyer,2,Sat Jun 20 00:14:27 2015 UTC,"Ask the millions of other game developers who allow preloading. Most games are in a distributable state weeks before they're released- as such, they can allow you to get the gold copy ahead of time so you don't have to wait for it when the release date comes.  There are still embargoes and patches to worry about, so especially in today's development climate it makes sense to wait until a day one patch is ready just in case the devs missed something in the gold version. If Steam broke the street date they'd be litigated against by Capcom.  Either way, I wouldn't doubt there's some way to crack the system and get to it early."
DevilMayCry,3agd8r,scionicspectre,2,Sat Jun 20 01:47:21 2015 UTC,"Most services like steam allow you to download the resources for the game but keep the .exe and other important and necessary files until the launch, so piracy groups can't do much except uncompress the pre-load and put it up on torrent sites.

DevilMayCry,3affcf,scionicspectre,4,Fri Jun 19 18:14:36 2015 UTC,"Is Vergil as laughably OP as he seems?  Is Lady as excellent as she deserves to be? (pleasesayyes) Her potential damage output per hit seems very high from what I've seen so far, maybe even surpassing Nero?  Is Trish more interesting than she appears? All the promotional material makes her look kind of boring.  Have you noticed any changes to proud souls - how many you obtain, how much moves cost, etc.?"
DevilMayCry,3affcf,KallyWally,2,Fri Jun 19 19:07:15 2015 UTC,"Vergil starts out pretty good, but when you unlock his abilities and, most importantly, learn to use them well, he's even more absurd than DMC 3: SE Vergil. I especially like how they upgraded the three-hit Yamato combo to embed a sword that breaks when you sheathe. Yamato itself is expanded insanely.  Lady is way better than I expected! Everyone's been making her look bad, honestly. Above all, she's a lot more powerful than you might expect, so to look stylish you'll want to avoid over-reliance on charged shots. I'd say she's near Nero's level of complexity.  Trish is actually really fun and organic. She doesn't have a lot of cool-down time in her moveset so there's a lot of room to experiment. It's a limited moveset, sure, but it's all about set-ups and being creative with the extra properties her moves provide.  Moves cost about the same but Proud Souls are acquired much more quickly. It does seem that you still run into the problem where your last 4 or 5 moves are still a pain to save up for as the price goes up (just like before). Also, the fact that you have all these characters means that you're more likely to get more Proud Souls saved up by playing as someone else."
DevilMayCry,3affcf,TBAAAGamer1,3,Fri Jun 19 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"Here are some details I found interesting that people might not ask about:   Vergil can 'grab' stuff like vital stars or red orbs behind gates with a simple summoned sword. Vergil can easily defeat Dante with no damage if you're aggressive. Summoned Swords can't reach the Savior from far away like Dante's bullets, but Vergil can Trick to the Savior's gems when it comes close. They've reduced the cost of sword formations (Spiral/Blistering/Storm/Heavy Rain) to one DT segment, most likely to encourage continual use. Lady will automatically throw grappled swords toward the glass or Agnus during the Agnus battles (or I was lucky to be holding the perfect direction). Lady retains inertia from her jumps so you can grapple an enemy up and down as you move towards them. Lady can do insane damage, easily on par with Vergil. Trish can trap enemies and use enemy step to get insane airtime easily. Combined with Sparda's move to bring enemies in, Trish's aerial gameplay has a lot of complexity. As suspected, there is no anti-aliasing in the console version and some inoffensive motion blur. The game runs perfectly so I doubt 2x MSAA or FXAA would hurt the framerate, but it doesn't bug me much. The game is beautiful. Drink it Down sometimes plays in Bloody Palace in the Japanese version."

If it is true, you may get slower performance on particle effects like in the original PC version.

DevilMayCry,3affcf,ColdVergil,3,Fri Jun 19 23:02:24 2015 UTC,"When you Trick with Vergil, does it automatically fire a sword like DmC? Does sheathing explode any swords that are visually in enemies, or do the swords have to be applied via other moves? Building on that, will swords explode regardless of DT concentration? Do the melee+style inputs feel any better? Thanks for taking the time to answer people's questions."
DevilMayCry,3affcf,ColdVergil,2,Fri Jun 19 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I went back to check and I've revised the following with corrections.  You automatically fire a sword when you trick- it's just for show.  The swords need to be applied with certain moves. DT'd Rapid Slash and the 3-hit pause combo for Yamato are examples. Sheathing your sword with a different move won't break the swords. These moves won't break existing swords from teleportation via trick.  An example- if you teleport to three enemies, embedding swords along the way, then you use the 3-hit Yamato combo, it embeds a sword at the end and sheathes to break only that sword, but none of the others. It may sound confusing, but it'll make sense when you play it. Swords will explode regardless of concentration.  /EDIT  The inputs feel really smooth after you acclimate to them. It was a bit weird at first since I'm used to DMC 3 Vergil, but I'd say they're a big improvement now that I'm familiar. And, just to pre-empt the question, it feels nothing like DmC Vergil."
DevilMayCry,3affcf,FMG_Ransu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:42:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply! If I remember right, every move that unsheathes Yamato had a sheathing animation. Do all sheathing animations, including air sheathing, activate swords or is it a select few? On the topic of sheathing, does completing the sheathing animation, without any embedded swords, raise your style ranking?"
DevilMayCry,3affcf,Dreceratops,2,Fri Jun 19 21:55:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, from what I can tell every time Vergil takes it out he puts it back in if you give him the chance. ;)  Only the moves that embed swords, like DT'd Rapid Slash and the 3-hit Yamato combo will break swords, and only the swords they embed. This is part of the corrections I made to the original post, probably after you replied.  In fact, I can't think of any other moves that embed swords, so they could be the only two. It also appears that they can't break each others' swords, as the Rapid Slash swords quickly shatter weakly if you don't sheathe to break them. So it's not much like Lucifer.  All the sheathing animations give you DT, and the sheathing during taunts gives you style points but won't necessarily bump you up to the next rank. Either way, there's a lot to Yamato this time around and it's definitely the most flexible and varied of the three weapons. I always switch back to it from Force Edge or Beowulf which definitely wasn't the case in DMC 3: SE.  EDIT: I corrected where I mistakenly said all sheathing animations give you style points- they give you DT."

DevilMayCry,3affcf,TheHermenator,3,Sat Jun 20 14:52:34 2015 UTC,How is Lady faring against bosses? How is her damage output?
DevilMayCry,3affcf,hotshotvegetarian,3,Fri Jun 19 23:05:14 2015 UTC,"Her damage output is easily on par with or above the other characters.  She's a murderer, especially with single targets like bosses. Her melee isn't all that bad, but her charged shots, shotgun nunchucks, and all of her rocket moves will obliterate. If you want a quick and deadly shot, an aerial rocket is your best friend, but Kalina Ann's multi-target move is devastating if you have some time to kill. A fully charged shotgun is probably the best option to kill things fast and stay mobile, but it's not as fun for me.  Also, you can charge the shotgun or pistols during other moves, so you may want to change your control scheme to make that easier on your fingers. Her attacks vary a lot when it comes to commitment and pay-off, so it's mostly up to you how much damage you want to do.  There's never one obvious option, and I like that. Just make sure you stay mobile or you won't get a chance to use those options- Lady's all about spacing."

DevilMayCry,3affcf,DracoRiff,2,Fri Jun 19 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"Well, you'll have all the important stuff after a single playthrough on Devil Hunter, and since your Proud Souls are shared by everyone it's going to be a breeze unlocking the moves you want after the first playthrough.  You'll still have a few moves that cost a ton, however, since the price scales with how many moves you've bought. You won't get absolutely everything until maybe 3 times through, but you'll have enough for all 5 characters at that point."

DevilMayCry,3affcf,Warsc2k,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:21:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, there's one gameplay tweak in particular I enjoyed- you don't have to jump onto any of the platforms during the Savior fight anymore. Just walk on.  Oddly, I didn't notice any difference with the dice game- it's about the same as the PC version. I thought that maybe the dice numbers would go up in order now to make it easier, but they're still out of order. It may be moving just a tiny bit slower, but not enough for me to tell. :\ The 'trick' to get a certain number still works, of course.  Also, I guess they don't count as 'tweaks', but there are a lot of interesting ways that enemies react to Vergil, Lady, and Trish's moves. Just little things, like being able to stop Sanctus' Sparda stinger with Yamato's sheath, Lady's auto-throw for Angus' sword demons, stuff like that.  No new battle music, sadly."

DevilMayCry,3affcf,Pepperglue,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"Just smack it with Yamato. Lady is the same- just use Kalina Ann's melee. It's actually harder with Lady since that move starts up so slow, so you may want to jump up and immediately use her first air melee hit.  I just realized that this may be how they made it easier, since I haven't tried melee with Nero, yet. Using gunfire makes it random."

DevilMayCry,3affcf,LockedAndClush,2,Sun Jun 21 03:11:18 2015 UTC,"No, go straight into SE. I'd recommend beating the game with Nero and Dante so you can get the full experience, of course, as Dante is still the deepest action game character of all time even next to these additions.  I don't think you'll have anything to gain from playing the vanilla game first except for boredom when you have to redo the same missions again. You would also have more appreciation for how quickly you can buy upgrades now, but I wouldn't want you to go through that. ;)"

DevilMayCry,3affcf,Charles_sparda,2,Fri Jun 19 21:30:19 2015 UTC,"You can play as Nero, Lady, and Vergil from the start. To unlock Dante or Trish you need to get to mission 12 with Nero or Lady or unlock Bloody Palace by beating the game on Devil Hunter. You could theoretically only ever play as Vergil in story mode but play as everyone else in Bloody Palace.  All characters are technically unlocked from the start, you just have to 'get to' Dante and Trish."

DevilMayCry,3ai5ij,TheAlmightyYori,6,Sat Jun 20 12:10:56 2015 UTC,I LIKE THIS THEORY! IT LINES UP PERFECTLY WITH EVERYTHING WE WERE TOLD ABOUT THE GAME BEING A REBOOT WITH NO TIES TO THE ORIGINAL CANON!!! TC YOUR THEORY IS FLAWLESS!!!
DevilMayCry,3ai5ij,TBAAAGamer1,-7,Sat Jun 20 14:31:20 2015 UTC,"Here's my theory: I don't even think dmc devil may cry is a prequel to the devil may cry series I mean in DMC 3 he was around 19 and in dmc devil may cry he's around 16 unless he and vergil had plastic surgery I don't think their faces can change that much.  So my conlusion is that it's just a spin-off I mean otherwhise they would've called it DMC 5.Also the mother of the old Dante was human and in dmc devil may cry she was an angel so they are two different persons.  In oher words Sparda got horny f**ked an angel and called his two sons Dante and Vergil . Also in the end of dmc devil may cry they say ""The beginning of the end for the demons. Mankind will be free"" in the other games the demons are still there and they never got rid of it.  So maybe there's hope for the original Dante to return in the next DMC game I mean technically dmc devil may cry has nothing to do with the original DMC games."
DevilMayCry,3ai5ij,Satiini,8,Sat Jun 20 12:15:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to be the one pointing it out, but since the first day and first words of the game DmC and it being a reboot it was crystal clear, that they dont share the same story. Also confirmed by Ninja Theory and Capcom later on, so it's kind of irrelevant to make that point now,because it was obv. from the get go.   Though I do hope a good portion of the DMC4SE sells so that Capcom might consider making a solid DMC5."

DevilMayCry,3af42j,caboosethedestroyer,2,Fri Jun 19 16:49:33 2015 UTC,"No. You can use Vergil or Lady when there are grim grips, but the missions themselves are untouched. Everyone shares the same blue orb fragments, though, so you don't need to complete them as Vergil, Trish, or Lady.  Of course, some of them are made much easier with other characters. The secret mission with mephistos and the disappearing platforms, for instance, is much easier with Vergil as he can just teleport back if there are enemies."
DevilMayCry,3af42j,scionicspectre,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"Well that kinda sucks, btw that particular mission would probably be easiest with Dante since you can just use the gunship mode on pandora to fly right to the end."

DevilMayCry,3af42j,scionicspectre,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:20:33 2015 UTC,"They probably can't, he's referring to the ones that require the devil bringer to pull yourself places since Lady has the grappling hook and Vergil has grim trick. There is one that requires you to use royal guard (one of Dante's abilities) and then the one that you are referring to. Based on what he said we will have to play as Dante or Nero to beat these missions."
DevilMayCry,3af42j,sujinjian,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:24:01 2015 UTC,"They can't. Since you don't need to do those with Vergil or Lady, it's not something you need to worry about. It's just like the original where you had to choose the right character sometimes."
DevilMayCry,3af42j,scionicspectre,2,Fri Jun 19 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"Righto  So if you do your first playthrough as Nero/Dante and get all the secret missions and fragments, Vergil, Lady and Trish will all have maximum health as well as all the proud souls earned during Nero/Dante's campaign, right?"

DevilMayCry,3aetgg,Monocorno,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yes- all of them, in fact. If you mean those that generate DT whether you just taunted or not, I think there are a couple with sword-sheathing animations that work consecutively."
DevilMayCry,3aetgg,Monocorno,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:06:22 2015 UTC,"I mean like in DMC 3: performing a taunt with Yamato while there are enemies around, makes Vergil glow with a dark aura and replenish DT, as long as he stays still."
DevilMayCry,3aetgg,mcwhoop,3,Fri Jun 19 18:18:18 2015 UTC,"K, after playing a bit more it turns out there's one higher level taunt (S or SS) where he puts his sword down in the sheathe and just waits while your DT builds. So maybe there is just one that acts that way, but for the most part it seems concentration is the replacement for that mechanic."
DevilMayCry,3ads7b,Dreceratops,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:16:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting notes:  All of the pre-release info made it sound like Trick Down was a DT specific move, and while it sounded stupid, there was no info that stated otherwise so I believed it. at 0:11, it definitely looks like he uses Trick Down out of DT.  He seems to be teleporting behind enemies, but that's probably a result of another move placing Vergil behind an enemy and Air Trick just working normally."
DevilMayCry,3ads7b,scionicspectre,2,Fri Jun 19 08:24:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I've been playing the game and it appears that Trick Down is DT-specific, so I don't know what the heck just happened. I've even slowed down the footage and I'm just not sure what to think. Trick Down would usually send you back more than that. I'm gonna' go double-check and update this post with my findings.  UPDATE: If you teleport towards the enemy (R1+Circle) at the right time during Rising Star, it brings you a fair bit below them instead of where you brought them to.

DevilMayCry,3a9b6u,Mikolos,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:40:00 2015 UTC,"Well, now we know why Dante didn't give a straightforward answer to Nero asking if they'd meet again. He's a voyeur.  Also, 'don't worry, I'll pay you when we get back'. What a punk- if I recall, Lady gave them a briefcase with a small roll of 20s."

I've already seen people using this image as a signature or a wallpaper and yes, it's sick.  It makes me wonder what kind of artwork you unlock after completing the higher difficulties. It seems clear that Nero/Dante will keep their own completion artwork, so there should be tons left for Vergil and Lady/Trish."

DevilMayCry,3a8trp,scionicspectre,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:16:12 2015 UTC,I caved and double dipped- installing inside the game now. For some odd reason they let you pick Nero's first mission and nothing else while the game's installing.
DevilMayCry,3a8trp,terrSC,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:48:56 2015 UTC,So you can play Nero's first mission while you're instsalling everything?
DevilMayCry,3a8trp,scionicspectre,2,Thu Jun 18 20:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, it installs something like 4 GB and an update first, then you can play while it grabs all the data which is about 20 GB. It's taking some time even though I've got decent internet- maybe because it's downloading from Japan's PSN and it's not optimized for US ISPs?  Either way, it gave me Nero's scarf costume from the outset so at least I have something new to see before I get crazy with you-know-who. I'm so glad the costumes are shown during cutscenes."
DevilMayCry,3a8trp,Mikolos,3,Thu Jun 18 21:22:13 2015 UTC,Me neither and freaking Steam still does not have Pre-load. Game is almost 30 Gb and my internet download speed is 380 kb/s... GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER CAPCOM/STEAM

Edit: His shadow in the ending cutscene is identical to Nero's phantom.

DevilMayCry,3a6hsg,scionicspectre,3,Wed Jun 17 20:59:21 2015 UTC,"Ah relax, anyway. I wonder why that shadow now... Maybe Vergil found a new power? Damn it Capcom... Or Vergil after getting that girl pregnant gained some sort of power idk... At least this gives more incentive for a new game."

I know this sounds really silly after what just happened, but I'm gonna' have to ask you to edit your comment to use spoiler tags. ^^;  [spoilers here](/spoiler)  It's a stretch, but it could be that they're using the shadow to retcon Vergil's Devil Trigger to make certain everyone knows Nero's phantom is Vergil. It's probably just a nod, though. Personally, I always thought that was Itsuno's redesign for Nelo Angelo."
DevilMayCry,3a6hlt,scionicspectre,9,Wed Jun 17 16:39:35 2015 UTC,Like so: Vergil gets pregnant and gives birth to Sparda!

DevilMayCry,3a7jw8,Zodiakh,2,Thu Jun 18 01:30:29 2015 UTC,Anyone should feel free to post an additional link to a clip of just the ending in addition to this. Just thought this would be good to have in case that doesn't show up for a while. Remember to use spoiler tags like in the sticky to talk about what happens in the ending!
DevilMayCry,3a7jw8,MarkS00N,2,Wed Jun 17 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this would be a spoiler or not, but would there be a new cutscene if we slay even more demon? Like maybe 100 like in DMC3? I kinda doubt that 30 is the limit we need to pass..."
DevilMayCry,3a7jw8,Kholdie,2,Thu Jun 18 02:35:10 2015 UTC,"Better safe than sorry.  I believe you get a special ending for defeating 100 in vanilla DMC 4 as well (Dante, Lady, and Trish getting a call), so I wouldn't doubt it. EDIT: It's for protecting Kyrie- the number of demons killed doesn't matter. There didn't seem to be a lot of time to get to 100, so Judgement Cut End would be you friend in figuring that out.  Itsuno was asked that question on stream today, however, and he said he'd rather leave it to the players to find out. Of course, that means there might not be anything."
DevilMayCry,3a7jw8,Kholdie,2,Thu Jun 18 02:46:12 2015 UTC,"OH MY GOD I don't know what to think AT ALL!  - Is Vergil, Nero's father?  - Is Vergil's soul on Yamato and he got released?  - Vergil simply escaped from Mundus power and survived?  I WANT CLEAR ANSWERS, CAPCOM!"

We don't know exactly what's going on, but it could be that Vergil's soul was somehow embedded in Yamato and only awoke when it was reforged."

DevilMayCry,3a6cqp,scionicspectre,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:10:31 2015 UTC,I am playing the reboot. I shall try aanother controller for now.
DevilMayCry,3a6cqp,scionicspectre,2,Wed Jun 17 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"Ah- for future reference, the reboot is usually referred to as DmC or DmC: Devil May Cry. Most people use DMC to refer to the series as a whole or the first game. Let us know how it goes."
DevilMayCry,3a4pk5,ColdVergil,2,Wed Jun 17 05:18:22 2015 UTC,"They managed to forget to change the price for the DMC franchise pack and 3+4 bundle. RIP the days of getting 3+4 for 7.50.   I've been enjoying DMC 3 PC, but my PC is medium-high spec and I've applied style switcher mod and most of the fixes. If you have the patience to apply all the fixes, I recommend picking it up at this price, but your mileage may vary.  ""If you didn't bother picking up this 7-year old game when it was $5.00 during the hundred other steam sales, fuck right off and buy the Special Edition."" -Hideaki Itsuno   But seriously, it looks like Capcom is just trying to funnel as many people as they can to SE instead of base game.   DmC PC is 12.00 for all the DLC, and Vergil's Downfall alone is worth the 4 dollars extra compared to just the base game. PC version with mods is essentially Definitive Edition minus lock-on, must style, costumes, and some level tweaks. If you don't have an Xbone or PS4 this is as good as it gets and is a third the price."
DevilMayCry,3a4pk5,Dreceratops,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:11:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I remember back when I used to trade in TF2 I managed to get DMC 3 for 2 keys(5$) DMC 4 for 3 keys(7.5$) and DmC for 3.5 keys(8.25$) But keys were super cheap and easy to get. You'd get a key for around 1.25$ or for some cosmetics of TF2 It was a pretty good deal back then
DevilMayCry,3a4pk5,iconic2125,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:03:04 2015 UTC,"Damn, for less than $5 I think it will be worth it to fight through the PC issues to get 3 working right."

I'm damned good at dark souls 2! proof?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEiDvAnN8hI  I'm extremely good at vergil's downfall, but not the best.  Point is, what makes me the brilliant and amazing gamer isn't my skill at gaming, it's my personality and ability to achieve anything, because I know I can.  and I know that other players can too. all this talk of ""oh i'll never be as good at dmc4 as donguri"" is all well and good, but donguri put in the practice before he ever became one of the best dmc4 players out there.

The sentence doesn't really make any sense to me. People are up to do what they want and invest their resources into what they want, its up to the other people to appreciate the beauty of the final product.   Not arguing against the any names mentioned, its just you can objectively separate them into appropriate categories.

But The Legendary Great True God Master Kail will always be at the top.  It's always a treat to see a Sakaki or Donguri video in my subscriptions list, but when I catch Chaser streaming it's always consistently good.    Michellgun201 always has interesting DmC content and I'd say he's definitely one of the best DmC players, but I haven't checked out many others."

It's as much of a ""special edition"" as anything can be, but unlike DMC4SE, it features corrections to the game's weakest content. DMC4 never needed more characters - what it's always needed is for more than half of the game to actually be finished.  I'm not saying that the special edition isn't welcome, I'm delighted that it's coming, but I'm disappointed that rather than the fully realized campaign that was sorely missing, we got even more awkwardly shoved in characters. It's just a damn shame that ""OMG VERGUL!!!1!"" is more marketable than ""we actually went back and fixed the one major flaw in the game."""
DevilMayCry,3a2ziy,KallyWally,2,Tue Jun 16 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"They dug themselves into a marketing corner when they delivered an unfinished product. now they have to commit and act like they did nothing wrong, because to do otherwise would be admitting that they created a flawed game.  and no company would willingly say that they lied."
DevilMayCry,3a2ziy,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:11:21 2015 UTC,"Scholar of the First Sin also came a year after a full priced game and $25 season pass, and I don't think seasons pass owners got an additional discount. DMC4 SE is a special edition of a ~7 year old game that constantly goes on sale for $5 dollars and is priced for half as much SotFS($25) and has already been seen with a 20% off discount. It's not the getting the content it needed or deserved, but its price doesn't suggest it is.   Edit: $25 season pass, not $30, but each episode on their own was $10."

DevilMayCry,3a2ziy,Rocklordofrockland,2,Tue Jun 16 22:39:21 2015 UTC,"I believe that Lady's and Trish's costumes (not their EX costumes, their full costumes - DMC3 Lady and Gloria) are pre-order bonuses which can later be bought as DLC."

DevilMayCry,39xeve,Monocorno,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"I thought it was just a low-effort nod to DmC fans but the homeless theory makes sense.    Devil hunting has no future. The better you are, the less job you have. If Dante keeps killing hell overlords he might find himself unemployed in this economy."
DevilMayCry,39xeve,scionicspectre,2,Mon Jun 15 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"Well, you gotta remember, DmC dante distances himself from people at the beginning BECAUSE he's always being hunted by demons, so lorewise his devil hunting is less hunting and just him constantly having to defend himself.  at the end I can imagine he gets to start his demon hunting business ala old dante thanks to limbo merging with the real world, so he'll make a killing.  However, what we do know about new dante is:   A, he'll never cry.  B. Getting stabbed through the chest will probably kill him  and C: His hair is way too spiky to look cooler when long like classic dante's."

I think we all knew something like this could happen, though, given Capcom's change in business practices since 2008.

I'm surprised this sub doesn't have the word ""circlejerk"" anywhere in the title. If you don't like the way DmC did things, don't play it, and just block it from your memory. It was literally just a money grab to make try and make it appeal to a wider audience. They weren't trying to fuck up DMC's barely coherent and lore. And they didnt. Cynicism may seem cool to most of you who spend a significant amount of time on the internet, but it does some good to not be angry about everything all of the time. I would love to see a change in how this sub operates, but I doubt t'll happen, of course."
DevilMayCry,39zhim,terrSC,3,Tue Jun 16 01:34:38 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I enjoyed DmC, always will. I don't get the hate, the only gripe I had was the story not really being any good."
DevilMayCry,39zhim,Illidan1943,2,Tue Jun 16 01:42:50 2015 UTC,"The story was shit. I'll even admit that I didn't like the game. But I don't sit here on reddit posting on it every single day (no saying that's what you do, just that there's a lot of that here). I can't understand why people latch onto hating something so much that doesn't affect them.   Also, I apologize if I came off as attacking on your post, I just saw the title and read through it once and thought it was another hate thread, and since this was of the more recent ones i figured I'd deliver my spiel here.

DevilMayCry,39sivg,Mikolos,6,Sun Jun 14 09:45:07 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who did love the DmC game, it was really unnecessary, it's true. I don't know why they decided to start again with their own vision of the entire game, or maybe that's it. They wanted to make it their own vision of DMC. It could also have something to do with copywrite, who knows. I think they just wanted to try and make it unique, and something they could stand out with."
DevilMayCry,39sivg,terrSC,6,Sun Jun 14 10:22:02 2015 UTC,"After the dev interviews I sort of have a theory for the complete reboot, maybe it was mentioned in the second one, and it was something like this:  they think that the western audience can't accept a world with hell and demons in it without a heaven inhabited by angels.  And if that really was what they thought the idea of a complete rewrite was logical to them maybe."
DevilMayCry,39sivg,terrSC,3,Sun Jun 14 10:31:57 2015 UTC,That makes sense I guess. A lot of people can't really accept a hell if there isn't a heaven or vice versa.
DevilMayCry,39sivg,scionicspectre,8,Sun Jun 14 14:50:05 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you at least acknowledge what you're doing in the title and so on. I guess there hasn't been a DmC down-talking thread for a while, so it was bound to happen as we near DMC 4: SE's release and people are starting to feel 'triumphant' about it.  Just try to keep the conversation constructive and refrain from flame-baiting and we're all good. I'm keeping a close eye in case things get out of hand, but I think everyone's entitled to express themselves in a reasonable way."

DevilMayCry,39sivg,scionicspectre,0,Sun Jun 14 16:52:49 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it exactly ""down-talking"" XD your comparison pic just clicked this for me shrug and I think with a descendant of Dante instead of a rewritten Dante the DmC reboot could have worked better."
DevilMayCry,39sivg,scionicspectre,2,Sun Jun 14 10:01:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose it's a thread critiquing DmC, not necessarily down-talking. Of course, I would expect this to attract people who are willing to talk smack, hence the close eye. ;)  As for myself, I always thought it could be interesting if they dedicated a game to Dante's lineage (referencing what he said at the end of DMC 1). In that case, it wouldn't be a stretch for someone to be named after their grandfather. But I don't think DmC is that game, and if they did that it would effectively kill future narrative choices, making Dante a distant and fixed memory like Sparda.  I think the main issue with DmC isn't necessarily the game itself, but the way people have chosen to see it as a bell tolling for the original series' demise. I think it's safe to say it hasn't had that effect, given the effort being put into DMC 4: SE, which is probably part of why people have calmed down so much.  While I agree to some extent that the reboot wasn't necessary, it seemed like it may be important at the time and we got a pretty good game out of it, so you won't see me complaining. Again, this is all my personal perspective on the matter."
DevilMayCry,39sivg,RageVG,2,Sun Jun 14 10:10:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah :D But imo the little backstory that DmC provided would not have set dante's past in stone(in case we say that he will die one day, and as he is aging, that will happen I guess?) , as let's think about it, have we ever heard of sparda's grandfather? XD I'm not hellbent on 2 generations tho.  I did not mean to imply that the DmC game as a whole was pointless, it just could have been executed with a bit more elegance. As for myself I played thru every single mode of the main game + vergil DF, so I obviously did not hate the game . . . but I'm glad the original is back haha"
DevilMayCry,39sivg,ColdVergil,2,Sun Jun 14 10:25:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tend to feel the same way. I was really passionate about DmC when it came out and enjoyed it thoroughly, but man did DMC 4: SE's announcement put a massive smile on my face.  And yeah, people still want a Sparda spin-off, so going to a place beyond Dante's lifetime wouldn't necessarily prevent them from revisiting and hashing out his adventures."
DevilMayCry,39sivg,TBAAAGamer1,2,Sun Jun 14 10:33:15 2015 UTC,"No, I personally really liked both the old story and the new one. They wouldn't be able to exist in the same universe as it'd conflict with each other, obviously. But I love both versions of the story (though I prefer the old one, mostly due to the fact it's much larger right now) and wouldn't want either of them changed."

There's no choir, it's just a keyboard. Whereas I wouldn't put it past him, it would be cooler if it were real people. It still might be! Either way, this is one of my favourite pieces of music hands down; from anything. Quite often I fall asleep to this on repeat."

DevilMayCry,39lv3r,ARima00,3,Fri Jun 12 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, those cutscenes are prerendered (at least in the PC version). It could be that the video files for those particular cutscenes have been misplaced, or you somehow don't have the codecs to play them.  If you got the opening cutscene where Lady is talking about the sons of Sparda, however, these should also work. I believe the file path is 'Program Files (x86)\CAPCOM\Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition\mov\'. The relevant files are m07_c00.mpg, m08_s00.mpg, and m08_s00.mpg."
DevilMayCry,39lv3r,scionicspectre,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I can see all the other cut-scenes ( The intro Included) but my files may be wrong , It goes like this 'Program Files (X86)/CAPCOM/Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition/mov/ipu/'. and a bunch of .BIN files."
DevilMayCry,39lv3r,scionicspectre,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"There is an ipu folder with a bunch of .BIN files, as well, but there should also be a few .mpgs in the mov folder itself. Of course, the .BIN files could be portions of video- I'm not certain they aren't. But if you're missing the files I mentioned I think it's a safe bet that's why they're not playing.  When all else fails, you can reinstall the game which should unpack all these files to the correct location. I'm playing with the original release (not Steam) so that might explain the differences."

DevilMayCry,39ikic,KirillianAmurawr,2,Fri Jun 12 00:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. I do like Vergil more than Dante to a point. However, we know a lot more about Dante than we do about Vergil, though hopefully that will change. I guess it's like having a bit of a crush on someone you see sometimes, while being in a relationship with someone else. You really want to know the other person, but you've no means to get to know them so you harbour a secret, desperate crush while being mostly content with the person you're with.    In other words, by the nine I need more Vergil in these games."

DevilMayCry,39blf8,justagamer2,8,Wed Jun 10 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"Gregaman and some other streamers have teased A LOT this and they say they're not able to talk about this neither Vergil's cutscenes. They also said that they will LOVE to talk about it, so I believe it pretty much confirms it.  Also, I have been analyzing some of the new moves Vergil has and they are the same as Nero has.  For example:   Air combo: Hit+Hit+ Little pause+ Hit does the same as for Nero and Vergil Vergil's 3 hit Drive ends the same as the move you are able to do with Nero's Devil Trigger  hitting forward+melee+Devil bringer   So... Just saying :P"
DevilMayCry,39blf8,ColdVergil,4,Wed Jun 10 18:21:00 2015 UTC,Where did he come from?   I think it's implied he's always lived in Fortuna. I don't think The Order would have trusted him if he was some outsider.
DevilMayCry,39blf8,DoveChaser,3,Wed Jun 10 18:40:07 2015 UTC,. He's lived in fortuna his whole life I believe . He got the Devil Bringer after suffering an injury in a demon attack . Because people fall in love sometimes.  Yeah the story was kind of good but lacked in places but that was due to the game being incomplete cos the team was rushed.
DevilMayCry,39blf8,TheKiwiJames,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:43:14 2015 UTC,What kind of injury would have done that?
DevilMayCry,39blf8,DoveChaser,5,Wed Jun 10 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"No idea. This is from the Wiki though. ""Before Devil May Cry 4 Mentioned in an incident report, a number of demons appeared suddenly from the Mitis Forest and attacked Fortuna. Luckily, Nero was present at the scene and exterminated all of the demons. During this incident, Kyrie, was injured while Nero received a minor injury to his right shoulder. Nero's sword, the Red Queen, was damaged and sent for repair. Kyrie recovered completely, but Nero's shoulder never healed. Initially he believed it to be an infection, but upon realizing it was demonic power, he began training with it in secret.[4] Nero continued to carry his arm, possessed by an evil force, in a sling after the incident in an attempt to keep it out of sight of others."""
DevilMayCry,39blf8,TheKiwiJames,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:03:49 2015 UTC,I got a crazy theory about this ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
DevilMayCry,39blf8,ColdVergil,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:05:09 2015 UTC,let's hear it :)
DevilMayCry,39blf8,Mikolos,2,Thu Jun 11 06:10:06 2015 UTC,"We know that this Special Edition is before DMC 3, So Vergil manages to get some girl pregnant. Well, how about that after the defeat of Nelo Angelo in DMC 1 Vergil does not die, manages to escape Mundus control and decides to pay his son a visit, in that incident report, we know that Vergil has a thing for hurting people to let them know or to awake their demon powers (points to impaled DMC 3 Dante) So he ''senses'' Nero and in that incident, in order to get more power maybe?, he goes and says ''Hey you're my son, you share my blood, join me and Ill show you true power'' Nero goes: ''You're a demon! My real father(whatever history the mom told him) died a long time ago'' So they fight and Vergil goes: '' Fine, I'll show you'' Cuts the shit out of Nero's arm and there Nero awakes his Devil Bringer beats the shit out of Vergil and Yamato gets broken. What happens with Vergil after now that I don't know. Maybe lives inside of Nero ? Maybe it's Liquid Snake MGS 4 sort of thing.Damn it Kojima, we are been played like a damn fiddle!  Another thing that I thought was that maybe Vergil was really wounded or out of power after Mundus and he needed a way to survive and het let Nero absorb him without Nero noticing after hurting his arm since somehow Nero's arm absorbs things. That would explain how Yamato gets suddenly fixed. Vergil inside of Nero's body is just adquiring more power. I don't know, I think a lot of crazy shit."
DevilMayCry,39blf8,ColdVergil,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:28:19 2015 UTC,"it's not crazy imo XD seems well put together   tho with vergil out of the picture this way, who will become the nemesis for the series? XD"
DevilMayCry,39blf8,Mikolos,3,Thu Jun 11 06:40:52 2015 UTC,That's the thing! He is just absorbing and absorbing more power to fully restore himself. What if in that incident he just came back possesing one regular demon? Then took the chance to hurt Nero and get inside of him. So at one point he will probably break out of Nero. This could also explain why Nero has a gigantic devil trigger. Only if he is Vergil's son because it would be a combination of both devil triggers that way making it real OP.

DevilMayCry,39blf8,leon467,3,Thu Jun 11 00:34:20 2015 UTC,"I remember reading some official stuff (As in, info that came from Capcom in interviews, magazines and such) that the Devil Bringer was always there, inside Nero. The injury that was caused by some random demon simply awakened it. It would manifest one day, one way or the other."
DevilMayCry,39blf8,xirog,3,Thu Jun 11 09:25:53 2015 UTC,"In an official artbook in japanese it's stated that he's the son of vergil, how or why? dunno, and the source could well he retconned at the drop of a hat as an editor's mistake, or it could be a mistranslation.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get hype for playable vergil in dmc4se."
DevilMayCry,39blf8,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:11:02 2015 UTC,"We do know he has Sparda blood. And he is young, so that means he's either Dante's or Vergil's son. That, or he's an experiment. Maybe Vergil got wounded and left enough blood samples or something behind after some specific fight (I'd imagine a bunch of the Order's fools along with Agnus going all in, and someone, somehow, eventually hurts Vergil enough to leave DNA material behind, like hair, for example), the Order them uses those samples to create their own little Sparda, thus creating Nero, a faulty Sparda clone, or should i say, Vergil clone.   ""But wait, Xirog, what do you mean with faulty?"" He's not part human part demon. Well, at least not before the beginning of the game. Before his arm got ""corrupted"", he was 100% human. As i said somewhere in this thread, some Capcom fella told us that the Devil Bringer had always been inside Nero, it only awakened after a demon attacked him, though. What that means is, that Nero can't transform into a demon and will never be able to turn into a human once goes full demon.  So yeah, that's my theory."
DevilMayCry,39blf8,xirog,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:36:52 2015 UTC,"Most likely he is just Vergil's son. In the none canon final directors cut graphic novel from the creator of the game straight out says it.  In the Vergil intro of the dmc4 SE you see a women looking at him, camera focuses on her. Most likely Nero's mother."

DevilMayCry,38s14b,dtaylor1243,8,Sat Jun 6 08:53:05 2015 UTC,"if it is a game dedicated for him, then after DMC1, he gets out of hell and stuff, maybe kills mundus once and for all and becomes the ultimate boss for the series, maybe even loses his human form and becomes a creature of pure power  if it is part of a multiple playable characters thing, like dante, trish, lady, nero have their campaigns(RE6 style) and vergil would have chapters beyond it, I would love to see how did mundus enslave/defeat him  edit: as for moveset, he can get a few new moves, but weapons don't suit him, he is the kinda guy that perfects a style beyond perfection, unlike dante who uses whatever he gets his hands on and kicks asses and takes names with it XD  although, I would really not mind a complete moveset redesign for him . . . but I guess he will stay the way he is, this DmCmeetsDMC"
DevilMayCry,38s14b,Mikolos,5,Sat Jun 6 10:14:02 2015 UTC,"I would tend to agree as far as move set is concerned, keep it with Yamato, and give us as many things to do with it as possible. Maybe get a Force Edge equivalent, but Yamato has always been HIS sword, so I'd like to see that weapon's move set expanded even further. Personally, I'd love a game about Vergil's awakening. What he went through after the demons killed Eva and how he became the cold power hungry Dark Slayer we all know and love. But then it would cause some continuity issues if he had weapons in this prequel that weren't In 3.   I like the idea of seeing his battle with Mundas, as well as defeating him in Hell after Dante beats him on Mallet Island."
DevilMayCry,38s14b,RussellLawliet,3,Sat Jun 6 10:44:58 2015 UTC,I don't see why that would be a continuity issue. Dante never uses any of his weapons after the game he gets them in either.

DevilMayCry,38s14b,KevinLee487,11,Sat Jun 6 15:08:03 2015 UTC,"WARNING : LONG POST  Personally, I would like to see the game start off with Vergil fighting Mundus at the end of DMC3. He gets defeated and Mundus forces him to become one of his generals or else Mundus will kill him. Vergil isn't happy, but agrees for the time being seeing as he really doesn't have much of a choice then plans to recover his strength and kill Mundus later.  Vergil does some enforcing on behalf of Mundus. Some demons trying to carve their own empires within Mundus's domain. Perhaps we could see the particularly vicious group that Berial is part of.  Eventually, Mundus creates Trish and makes her fight Vergil as a test of her strength. She's powerful, but Vergil is far beyond her power and experience and defeats her without much issue. Vergil insults Mundus's power if this was the best he could come up with and decides that now is the time to kill Mundus.  They fight and Vergil is soundly defeated after inflicting some pretty decent wounds on Mundus. As punishment for his treachery, Mundus shatters the Yamato, casts it out of the demonic world and then forcibly enslaves Vergil. Queue DMC1 cutscene.  After Vergil's defeat as Nelo Angelo, it is shown that he survived and somehow ended up in Fortuna many years after Mundus's defeat. While wandering the town, completely clueless as to how he got here and how long he has been ""gone"", he comes across Kyrie. She notices his white hair and other similarities to Nero. Intrigued, she offers him a place to stay and he begrudgingly accepts being as he has no weapons, money and nowhere to sleep.  At home, Nero meets Vergil and is taken by surprise. White hair? The only other person Nero knows with white hair is...... Then he notices. Vergil looks almost exactly like Dante. It took him a minute due to Vergil's clothes and hairstyle being so different, but there was no mistaking it. Then Nero remembers what Dante had said about having a brother and that the Yamato had belonged to him.  ""So Vergil, let me ask you something. Do you have a brother named Dante?""  -glare- ""What do you know of Dante?! He has something that belongs to me.""  ""Speaking of possessions, does this belong to you as well?"" Nero then materializes the Yamato and Vergil instantly snatches it from him, wounds Nero and bolts out of the door. It is at that moment that Vergil realizes why he ended up here. He was subconsciously drawn to the Yamato.  Nero calls Dante and tells him everything that had just happened. Dante is utterly shocked to say the least, but thanks Nero and hangs up. Knowing exactly what Vergil is after, Dante HAS to stop him. Letting someone like Vergil get their hands on Sparda's full power would effectively put an end to the world as he knew it. But having no clue where Vergil is at the moment, Dante decided his best course of action would be to have Lady and Trish clear out and wait by himself for Vergil inevitably coming to Devil May Cry.  Vergil fights random demons on his way to Devil May Cry. In the wake of the Hellgates in Fortuna getting destroyed, the Demons have nowhere to retreat to and they know Nero would kill them if they tried to hunt humans anywhere near Fortuna.  Eventually Vergil arrives at Devil May Cry and finds Dante waiting for him.   ""WHERE IS IT?!""  ""Haha. All that time away and I don't even get a hello?""  ""I'm not here for your games Dante now where is it?! I. Need. My. POWER""  ""I've kept it safe all this time and I'll continue to keep it safe. You can't handle that kind of strength""  ""You don't know the meaning of strength.....allow me to show you."" Yamato is drawn  COMMENCE EPIC BOSS FIGHT OF ULTIMATE DESTINY  -cutscene- Vergil and Dante have the most epic battle known to man. I'm talking a LONG cutscene. Anime episode long with neither one being able to land a blow on the other. During their battle, Dante tries to convince Vergil to stop this. Theres no reason for Vergil to want that power anymore. Vergil states that he needs to kill Mundus to avenge their mother.  The battle pauses as they break away from each other and Dante stares at the ground. He explains that he already defeated Mundus years ago shortly after the last time he saw Vergil. Vergil becomes heavily confused and demands Dante to tell him what hes talking about. Dante explains that after Vergil's defeat on Mallet island, Dante was able to fully activate Sparda's power and seal Mundus away. Vergil doesn't remember any of it. He explains that after their fight in the demon world years ago, Vergil attempted to kill Mundus after being forced to serve him for a time. But he was defeated and the last thing he remembers his Yamato being broken in half. If what Dante says is true, then Mundus is still alive. Vergil demands a final time that Dante give him Sparda's power so he can put an end to the demons once and for all with his own hands and then gets into a ready stance.  ""Vergil, when you decided to stay in the demon world, I was lost. You were the only family I had and we had spent our last few hours together with our swords through each other. Back then, I was willing to kill you so you wouldn't end up destroying everything with your obsession. Now, I understand the importance of family. Think. What would our mother say if she saw us like this? Do you think she would have wanted her sons to fight over our dead father's powers? If you think he was so great, why won't you follow his example?! He knew his powers were far too great to allow them to be out in the open, so he sealed them up.""  ""So Vergil, please. Stop this before its too late. Remember how close we were before it happened? What happened to the Vergil I remember? The happy Vergil? Come with me. Together, we can make sure what happened to our mother never happens to anyone every again.""  ""Dante, I can't rest until I put an end to Mundus. Permanently. If you insist on standing in my way of that goal, I will kill you to get there. Family or not.""  ""Then lets put an end to him as brothers, not as enemies. If we work together, we don't need father's power. Together, were far stronger than he ever was by himself.""  With that, Vergil sheaths his sword and agrees to Dante's proposal.  Afterward, Dante calls everyone to Devil May Cry in order to go over their plan of killing Mundus once and for all. Nero arrives and is quite furious to see Vergil there. Dante apologizes on Vergil's behalf to which Vergil shoots an angry scowl and simply states ""You had my sword, and I wanted it back. If you don't want to get hurt, maybe you shouldn't touch things that don't belong to you."" Dante stops Nero from losing his cool and explains that they can handle this later because there are more important things on the agenda.  Lady and Trish aren't too thrilled to see Vergil either. Dante again has to intervene between the two angry women and Vergil who just mocks them.  Vergil and Dante explain that with the combined power of Yamato, Rebellion, Sparda, and their blood that they can create a rift gateway to the demon world by using the Sparda sword as a conduit. Once the gateway is open, it will inevitably attract demons who wish to escape into the human world. Trish, Lady and Nero's job is to make sure that not a single demon escapes or hurts anyone and to protect the Sparda while Dante and Vergil venture farther into the demon world than they've ever gone in order to unseal Mundus and kill him.  They all put the plan into action and the rift is opened. Dante and Vergil venture far into the demon world, killing many of Mundus's leftover army who are still loyal to him. They are eventually separated and continue on their paths toward Mundus. During this time, Vergil reflects back on the obsession with power that he has had ever since his mother was killed. He thinks about how happy he used to be and how close he was with Dante. Vergil vows that after Mundus is dead, that he will work to improve his relationship with Dante. Maybe one day they can be close again. After-all, Dante is his twin brother.  Dante and Vergil eventually meet back up just before they find Mundus. They combine Yamato+Rebellion's power to break the seal. Mundus awakens and is pleasantly surprised to see both of Sparda's sons are the ones who freed him.  ""The sons of Sparda. Tell me, have you come to repay me for your father's betrayal?""  Vergil spoke first ""On the contrary my dear Prince. We've come to watch you die.""  Dante followed ""You destroyed our family out of anger. Now, its time to pay the piper big guy, because were here and pissed off.""  Commence ass whopping of epic proportions   Dante lets Vergil land the final blow. With that final blow, Vergil feels as if a massive weight has been lifted off of him. It's done. Vergil's entire purpose for living these past decades has been completed. For the first time since their mother was killed, Vergil cracked a genuine smile.  The two make their way back to the human world. The ground is littered with dead demons and Lady, Trish and Nero are having a pizza.  Dante exclaims ""No invitation to the party? You guys are so mean!""  Lady replies with ""Well the demons just stopped a little while ago and we figured you'd be hungry when you got back, so we ordered out""  ""Excellent!"" Dante goes to snatch the last piece, only to have Vergil grab it as well.   ""I landed the killing blow, I get the pizza!""  ""No way! Its my favorite!""  Suddenly, the rift widens and dozens of demons begin to pour out. Dante and Vergil turn around. Dante draws Ebony and Ivory while Vergil unsheaths Yamato.   Trish yells ""Whoever kills the most demons gets the last slice!""  Vergil looks at Dante and says ""You will not forget this devil's power!""  Roll credits  If you manage to kill 100 demons while the credits roll, the final rank screen shows Vergil eating the final piece of pizza while Trish, Lady and Nero all laugh at Dante who is sitting down pouting."
DevilMayCry,38s14b,KirillianAmurawr,4,Sat Jun 6 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, I immensely enjoyed reading that. Kudos to you if you've gone over this idea so much as to have laid out the plot to a good  dmc5 game from Vergil's perspective. Knowing Capcom and how cheesy the DMC games can be, the ending isn't really far fetched either. I do think that not having Nero as a boss would be a mistake in a game where Vergil meets him while looking for Yamato. Seeing how in your iteration of events, Vergil wakes up with no weapons he'd have to take Yamato back, and THEN Nero fights him to try and get it back (he fails, obviously). I like that ending cutscenes idea, the only thing I'd add is Vergil making a quip at Dante's expense, and the others laughing at said quip. Maybe he'd also say something along the lines of ""I wouldn't have thought that pizza was this good"" as he eats the pizza slowly to taunt Dante."
DevilMayCry,38s14b,KevinLee487,5,Sat Jun 6 15:03:38 2015 UTC,"To be 100% honest, I had never sat down and gone over what I think a Vergil focused DMC should be about.  I've had little ideas here and there, but a lot of that came to me as I was typing. I definitely want Vergil to still be alive in the current DMC canon and his ""death"" was vague enough to where Capcom can bring him back into the fold without issue. I think they did that on purpose.  I really wanted to include something about Vergil being Nero's father (since its the widely accepted theory by now) but its being hinted that Vergil's cutscenes in DMC4 will have something to do with that so I left it out. Also, none of the characters would know for sure that Vergil and Nero are related like that. I doubt Vergil himself even knows though he would probably have a really strong suspicion (assuming were sticking to the theory of Vergil knocking up some random woman in Fortuna) given that he knows he had relations with a woman in this town before. Vergil and Nero don't seem like the type of characters to bring that topic up, especially considering the circumstance I put them in.  As far as Nero getting his ass kicked by Vergil, I don't think its necessary. He knows he can't take Dante even with Yamato and if Vergil was good enough to simply snatch Yamato out of his Devil Bringer hand and then wound him instantly, he wouldn't have a chance in fighting Vergil without it, especially after Vergil lands a good hit on him with the only weapon that we've seen harm the Devil Bringer. And besides that, Nero was ready and willing to give Yamato back after DMC4. Knowing that Vergil is its rightful owner, Nero would most likely accept it and not put up a fight about Vergil taking it back.  Though he would owe Vergil a few punches for payback."
DevilMayCry,38s14b,ColdVergil,4,Sat Jun 6 18:46:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've noticed that, we will just have to wait another couple of weeks to see what SE reveals about Vergil's involvement in Nero's lineage.   As far as Vergil vs Nero, I was thinking more from an entertaining fight gameplay perspective. I think it would be a very fun fight to participate in. Nero's Devil Bringer would be an element unique to that fight that both Vergil the character and the player haven't gone against, and it'd be a great way to throw a bit of challenge Vergil's way. Canonically Vergil's obviously much stronger than Nero, and the cutscenes would indicate that. There's definitely wiggle room to make it happen. To me it makes sense both ways."
DevilMayCry,38s14b,TBAAAGamer1,4,Sat Jun 6 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"It would definitely be fun being that Nero isn't exactly a pushover. But from a lore and character perspective, it wouldn't work.  Vergil always goes straight for the kill and Nero wouldn't be able to defend himself against it like Dante can being that Nero has nothing in the advantages department. Unlike Dante, Vergil would be able to get through the Devil Bringer defense and Vergil is far faster than Nero is to top it off. So the cutscene would end up with Vergil being out of character, or having their strength differences being skewed for the sake of an intense cutscene.  I would love to see a Death Battle type deal between the two, but I don't think having them actually fight in-game would be worth all of the other things that would raise red flags such as their power differences, Vergil not going for the kill, and Nero ignoring his common sense and trying to battle him anyway."

DevilMayCry,38s14b,KevinLee487,3,Sat Jun 6 20:21:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, given how he's one of two sparda siblings, this is entirely fitting to the mood of devil may cry. it's high time vergil got some love and stopped just being a villain."
DevilMayCry,38s14b,ColdVergil,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:18:02 2015 UTC,Yeah yeah but I mean he's gotta be a little more serious.
DevilMayCry,38s14b,Tmannpunk_EPN,2,Sat Jun 6 22:39:49 2015 UTC,"Hes far more serious than Dante, but hes such a 2 dimensional character as he currently stands.  He has 2 moods. Laughing at you, and angrily attacking you.  If we have any hope of him being in future games, he really needs to be fully fleshed out as a character.   The reason that he acts the way he does in DMC3 is because he has a goal and its a pretty damn serious one. Clearly Eva's death affected him more than it did Dante. Dante simply hid from the demons until it was over. Vergil took Yamato and ran off. He wasn't strong enough to fight them so when they impaled him to a gravestone with Yamato, it really drove home the notion that he wasn't strong enough.  I mean, he was only 8 years old when it happened. He has completely shut himself off from everyone emotionally in order to protect himself from getting hurt again.   Hes also deluded himself into thinking that Humans are worthless due to his obsession with power which is a direct result of the way he felt when Eva was killed. Vergil has been emotionally dead most of his life.  So how do we flesh him out? Well he can't just suddenly start exhibiting emotion. We have to give him a reason to drop his obsession. The only way to do that is to deal with the one who caused it all.  Don't get me wrong, I like serious Vergil as much as the next guy, but as he stands, he will never be more than a villain. He doesn't have to be all buddy buddy with Dante, but having him become an ally is really the only way that he can be not dead.   A good example of what I would like to see of his relationship to Dante is that of Zaraki Kenpachi to Ichigo's little gang of friends. (Bleach Anime/Manga) Hes not exactly their friend per-sue, but they can count him to help out and do the right thing when the situation calls for it. He can show emotion on occasion, but he is absolutely serious a vast majority of the time.  Here is a perfect scene of what I'm talking about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-JwO2rh-0w   Its kind of funny how similar that scene is to when Vergil stops Arkham from killing Dante.  Edit : Hell now that I think about it, Vergil seemed to get along pretty well with Dante when they were fighting Arkham. It portrays Vergil in such a way that says hes not evil and he doesn't hate Dante, hes just on the wrong path and that he can possibly be redeemed."
DevilMayCry,38s14b,ColdVergil,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:00:05 2015 UTC,Haven't seen Bleach yet xD You're saying this Vergil should be like Dante is in the anime? 'Cause Dante is pretty serious in the series yet there's a slighty funny touch to him and his not a buddy buddy to Lady but they are allies. It could be like a cool off. That way it could work with Vergil but please no cheesy dialogue. DmC traumatized me.  EDIT: Sorry brother distracted me and missed the scene at the end
DevilMayCry,38s14b,KevinLee487,2,Sun Jun 7 02:06:50 2015 UTC,Anime Dante's personality would fit a redeemed Vergil pretty well with a couple of minor changes. Hes nowhere near the cheery Dante we see in DMC4.  I also edited the previous post and included a short scene to give an example of what I was talking about.

DevilMayCry,38s14b,ColdVergil,2,Sat Jun 6 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah but no so cheesy XD Remember from the wiki: Personality is almost the complete opposite of Dante's personality his silence is not due to a lack of self-confidence; it is because he never shows fear for anything. Interestingly, despite his cold persona and ruthlessness he is an honorable warrior who follows a strict combat discipline. Just a workaround his dialogue/behavior on your story should be fine. Vergil despises fighting dirty and (as Nelo Angelo) he refuses to attack his opponents from behind. also has no tolerance for failure or insubordination so that part with wounding Nero wouldn't be good."

Especially something like Yamato. That is his sword, in his eyes Nero has no right to touch it.  In that situation, he would probably furious. This random guy has his sword that was effectively stolen from him years ago. Also remember that the Yamato was passed down to him by Sparda who we all know Vergil regards very highly.

HELL, Demons have done WAAAAYYY MORE for humans (Sparda, Dante, Nero) than angels, so it makes sense they do not give a single fuck about them...  DmC biggest flaw in the lore was that... giving a ""important"" role to the angels, yet not showing a single relation to them rather than  some graffiti and weapons... such a wasted opportunity imo"
DevilMayCry,38rl0c,Davidzeero,2,Sat Jun 6 23:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree that there's no way we can definitively rule them out even with this explanation from Itsuno. I think it's safe to say that they might as well not exist, though- that is, they're unimportant to the game world and story even if they do exist. I don't imagine Itsuno wanting to change this.  Also, concerning DmC, you could be forgiven for thinking that the angels may have gone extinct, so even in that universe they only play a critical role in terms of explaining Vergil and Dante's strength."
DevilMayCry,38rl0c,Davidzeero,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:53:21 2015 UTC,"Well, i never thought of it that way... nice point. Although i still think some more relation could have been cool...   If DmC does get a sequel, i think its safe for them to try the wild stuff there, such as those angel trigger ideas or some ambient and level designs focused on angels...   And keep it more safe with the original series, focusing on Demons and such"
DevilMayCry,38rl78,Trollhoffer,5,Sat Jun 6 05:19:54 2015 UTC,"From what you've said so far, the only action games I know you've played are DmC, DMC 4, the Souls Series, and the Monster Hunter games. I've yet to touch the Monster Hunter games (PC port when Capcom ;_;), but I'm more than familiar Dark Souls. I picked up both genres, stylish action and strategic action, at around the same time so I learned to play both instead of ""coming from"" one genre to the other. I'd like to hear your thoughts on:   The lack of dedicated lock-on and The concessions that had to be made because of it (dedicated launcher, dedicated dodge)   And I'd also like to know how you played the game. Did you play it like a Souls Game (attack, dodge, attack, back off, attack more) or did you quickly learn that most enemies had 0 poise and had 0 ways to break out of a combo? Also, did you alternate between enemies a lot, or did you single out one and combo it to death?"
DevilMayCry,38rl78,Dreceratops,-2,Sat Jun 6 07:57:08 2015 UTC,"The lack of dedicated lock-on   Basically fine. While I personally prefer dedicated lock-on, I never found that the DmC series had a particularly good one, particularly being based on the needs of fixed camera angles rather than a player-directed camera.    The concessions that had to be made because of it (dedicated launcher, dedicated dodge)   I'm fond of these decisions in general because of how vertical this genre of action game is in general, and how relevant that is to classic DmC for setting the trend. What these decisions amount to is binding a particular button to a strategic concept. Games often struggle with literal truths, but are very strong when it comes to expressing abstract ones. What the remake does here is roughly equivalent of the longsword in Dark Souls having a diagonal cut bound to R1 and a thrust bound to R2. A very different game, of course, but why not just have secondary attacks bound to holding R1 and free up a button? Binding these functions to different buttons encourages the player to psychologically organise them as being distinct options rather than variations on the one, for one thing. As a rule of thumb, I consider anything a game can do to passively express its rules to the player a good thing. Controllers and gamepads are powerful tools for this kind of design, and this is one area where I consider the remake stronger than the original.    Did you play it like a Souls Game (attack, dodge, attack, back off, attack more) or did you quickly learn that most enemies had 0 poise and had 0 ways to break out of a combo? Also, did you alternate between enemies a lot, or did you single out one and combo it to death?   I definitely exploited the 0 poise element of most enemies, but unlike the Souls games, DmC rewards you for the degree of your success rather than just its presence. This goes some way to keeping poise-exploiting combat against easier enemies a little interesting, but other obstacles break it up. Shielded enemies and flying enemies are welcome breaks, although I really dislike the colour-coded enemies. There are really good reasons for diversifying your weapon choice in the game without colour-coded enemies to turn combat into a much more binary experience. Their issue is that their narrowness forces the player to do the opposite of what the rest of the game is about -- maximise the diversity and absurdity of your combos.   On the other hand, I really like that some of the enemies (including some basic enemies) on higher difficulties block often. This means that attacking them is an effective strategy for keeping them at bay, but you need to find a more specific avenue of attack. Additionally, one has to be on their toes, because trying to attack incessantly ultimately leads to tears. Ultimately, I found it was more effective to play it more like a Souls game, plus aerial shenanigans, on higher difficulties. That impressed me, because a lot of games in this genre don't really ask me to strategise terribly well. It also clarified the value of aerial combat in this game, because in going aerial, I often freed myself of defensive considerations that would have been present on the ground. DmC fans might not have liked the remake, but I can see a lot of really solid design considerations have gone into the game's systems from a vacuum's point of view."
DevilMayCry,38rl78,NimbleBrain,4,Sat Jun 6 09:10:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the game design for DmC felt like a really sloppy compromise. It has platforming and exploration mechanics but totally linear level design. The combat used designs found in ARPG's like ""use this SPECIFICALLY for this"" but still had the old combo system.  Honestly, this game should have either gone full metal and been a DMC 3 remake or should have been something like a darker Legend of Zelda/Dark Souls. Their attachment to the old franchise design but desire to experiment clashes a lot in the final product. It has its moments but when the game design's flaws show, it's very cringeworthy espscially since they had some interesting ideas in there."
DevilMayCry,38rl78,BadNewBearer,3,Sat Jun 6 18:25:11 2015 UTC,What it boils down to is simple DmC is a good action game . It's just not a good devil may cry series game
DevilMayCry,38rl78,Davidzeero,3,Tue Jun 9 20:12:52 2015 UTC,"So you're saying the biggest problem with DmC is the reputation prior the games release? WOAH WOAH WOAH... Hold on, you can't say that...   people will get offended by how acurrate that is  I agree with you man, DmC, with flaws and everything, is nothing near as bad as people tend to make it look like... And, at least they tried something different with it, regardless some of the changes being bad...    I'm looking at you DMC 4..."
DevilMayCry,38rl78,krynnmeridia,3,Sat Jun 6 06:15:05 2015 UTC,"Some of us also use 'Donte' as a means to quickly differentiate between classic Dante and reboot Dante. For me, at least, it's not a negative thing- just a way to save time."

DevilMayCry,38rl78,Dreceratops,-1,Sat Jun 6 14:05:41 2015 UTC,"I have played DmC4. In fact, it was the only DmC I had completed to a reasonable degree before the DmC remake. I've also played the original, and bits of the second and third. While I've never been a DmC ""fan"", I've flirted on and off with the series for some time, but it's never been a thing for me in the way something like Monster Hunter has (wanna know about dumb damage calculations? :DDD).  What I'm particularly commenting on in terms of the remake's mechanics are their clarity and versatility. Even by taking the sword uppercut option off the Backward+Triangle input and giving its own button, aerial combat is implicitly emphasized. For all the flaws the remake has, it's a really clever game design decision given the genre's vertical bias. I can see why DmC vets might not like the game overall, but there's also such a thing as recognising deliberate and clear design decisions. Particularly those that contain some comment on the design intentions of the game or the tendencies of the genre."

I can only hope that they didn't screw up the amazing performance that DMC4 had. I don't mind the DX11 upgrade but it's unfortunate there's no DX12 or Vulkan so we can actually enjoy DMC4:SE on any platform we like including Linux!  I also don't want them touching the graphics at all in case they mess up performance. DMC4 still looks amazing even on last-generation consoles I am still impressed by the transition from Fortuna castle to the forest area as Nero. Walking there and letting the camera pan slowly... it's crazy the game looked that good and performed that well on such old hardware and it really comes through on PC as well with off-the-charts framerate or super high resolutions. My friend can push DMC4 @ 8K resolution and still get ~70fps. There's very few games you can say that for.  Here's hoping Special Edition looks and performs as well as the original! The fact that they had to even advertise 60fps on the official page is a little worrying though. DMC4 came out 7 years ago and didn't use that as a sales pitch... what the hell happened to games to have to list standards as features?"

Unfortunately, there is some odd stuttering that isn't related to performance, so I'm hoping this will change in Special Edition. Either way, that's why I keep Windows around, to ensure I get the most optimized experience when things don't work out on the Linux side for whatever reason. Even official ports are often using wrappers that don't maximize the potential performance available in OpenGL.  Of course, I would die happy if they ever ported Devil May Cry to SteamOS. With games like BioShock, The Witcher, Batman, and Shadows of Mordor coming over, I have hope.  By the way, I totally agree that 60 FPS should be a standard, at least for games like this. Devil May Cry 4 is a perfect example of a game that performs beautifully but doesn't try to make a big deal about it- it's all to help you have fun."

The particles on the original DMC 4's DX10 version were much slower and took off a few frames, so with the focus on particle effects and improved textures in Special Edition, it could need a slightly beefier computer than the original to perform well.  It would probably be harder to build a new computer that couldn't handle that, so if you've been PC gaming over the past few years I doubt you've have any trouble. There's also a chance that MT Framework was updated to improve the DX10 version's performance, so who knows what could be in store? It may even run smoother than the original."

Got Devil May Cry 4 on the Xbox 360 a while after its launch. Really liked it, but it was clearly not as finished as DMC3 (level repeats and all) but I really wanted more, especially of the Dante gameplay.  Finished the series by getting DMC1 and 2 for $10 each on the PS2. Had difficulty getting into DMC1, and never even put DMC2 in the PS2 to try.  Got the HD Collection for the PS3 while it was on sale for like $10. Finished all three of the games. Enjoyed most of DMC1, but hated the water sections. Hated DMC2, since it was just really boring.  Rebought DMC4 for the PS3 to have them all on the same system. Still haven't finished it on that platform.  Probably gonna get DMC4 Special Edition on PC, now that my rig is pretty decent for modern games."

The first taste of Devil May Cry I ever actually got was DmC: Devil May Cry and for the most part I found it enjoyable but it felt kind of lackluster compared to what I had heard about the previous entries (also by this point I didn't even know Devil May Cry 4 existed). Then last year I went into a store called United Video where you can hire movies and games. It was there I discovered Devil May Cry 4 for the first time. I hired it and played the shit out of it (on easy mode... I""M SORRY OK) It was one of the most fun games I had played to date. Few months later I bought DMC4 and DMC3 on steam and with the help of Style Switcher and a controller played the best game in the series (with me getting my ass kicked less time than I thought tbh). 2 months ago I went on Ebay and bought Devil May Cry HD Collection so I could see what the other 2 were like. I still play Devil May Cry (mostly going through normal mode collecting as many items and red orbs as possible for DMD preparation)  Devil May Cry 2 though? I think it's best we never talk about that game.  Then just last month I pre-ordered Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition."

I recall being amazed that he had, not only a PS2, but a 60 GB HDD and Windows XP on his PC. A sign of the times, I suppose.  I went home, bought a game for the first time at the age of 13, and I was hooked. After a couple years I heard through a friend that DMC 2 had come out, and with two playable characters nonetheless! Had to try it and... the first time beating it I actually preferred Lucia's story. I didn't have a great deal of hope for the series, and this little tune playing at the end of the game surely played on my emotions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe30L1GwhSU  I thought Devil May Cry was officially dead.  A few years later, my friend who had never played DMC called me over to his house to watch this amazing trailer for a new action game that was just revealed- Devil May Cry 3. I could already tell from the trailer showing us the names of moves that this game was gonna' be serious business. Million Stabs, Fireworks, Rainstorm, OMG! Needless to say DMC 3: SE made my jaw drop.  Later on, I didn't have a PS3 or Xbox 360 for the first few years they were out as I wanted a Playstation and they were rather expensive. I ended up playing through Devil May Cry 4 at a friend's and enjoying it just as much as DMC 3. I guess the hype had persisted enough to help me overlook any flaws the game might have had, especially when we were given style-switching. I honestly didn't know how to handle it for the first few years.  Then the DmC announcement- I was like, ""wait, what? Interesting."" I actually felt, at this point, that maybe it would be best to reboot the series and see if there were some way to streamline the game. I had mixed feelings, but I wanted them to go all out with it and see what Ninja Theory's vision for the Devil May Cry would be. Over the following years leading up to its release, I saw more and more hate and repeatedly came to the game's defense in online forums. When the game came out, I absolutely loved it and got pretty high on the leaderboards as I played for about 100 hours over the course of three months.  Then it all settled down and I realized that, despite my love for DmC, I really missed the old series. I missed the absurd learning curve that came with the fun.  So yeah, DMC 4: SE is like a dream come true. I got to fully enjoy both sides of the series and I have no regrets."

I was young and at that point I just played games because they looked cool, it's probably fair to say I was that kid that judged a game by it's cover.  So back when I played them, I remember loving the cocky characters of Dante and Vergil being the power hungry guy he was. I know these were my favourite games for sure, then a few years ago I picked up the HD collection and played them all through before DMC came out, and I enjoyed them so much! (this being in the days of Skyrim etc). DMC4 was probably the one game I had most fun playing though, with DMC3 being a close 2nd.   I know some DMC fans weren't big lovers of 4 but I loved it so much. It was a little annoying having to pretty much beat every boss twice but Nero simply beat them, Dante handed them their ass! Plus all the new weapons were really cool!  DMC3 easily had the best and hardest fight (for me) against Vergil (the 2nd encounter) and with the first fight how Vergil ended him and Dante hit his devil trigger, so badass!   As for DMC reboot. It was definitely my least favourite but I wasn't the DMC fan to ""hate"" it. I liked the dynamic aspect of molding and shapeshifting environments, the story was a bit eh and I got over the whole thing pretty fast.   Now I'm so excited for Vergil being in DMC4SE and I can't wait. Since I've read up on the whole Nero being Vergil's son theory, I've been so excited to see if it's true or for Capcom to confirm something and/or add a storyline to that. I'm not saying it will come true or anything but I'm really curious as to where Vergil fits in to the whole DMC4 world.  Not much of a story but Devil May Cry will always have a soft spot in my heart!"

Now again I'm convinced to go Next-Gen (err--current gen for you lucky folks) to get 4:SE and maybe DmC:DE. Just really waiting to feel the way I did when I played 3."

It was rather nice.  I played the rest of the franchise.  It was rather nice too.  So now I love it.  I played DMC4 and thought ""wow Vergil would be sexy as hell in this engine"", and my prayers were heard."
DevilMayCry,38fl1j,stealthcl0wn,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:47:05 2015 UTC,"My first experience with the series was when it first debuted back in 2001. I was 16 at the time, and around the time leading up to its US release I was yearning for an action title after becoming a bit burnt out on the tons of RPGs I’d been playing up to that point. One day while at my local hobby store in the neighborhood the staff were playing the a demo; it was the first Nelo Angelo fight. I was mesmerized. I had never seen an action game where you dueled a boss in a swordfight before. I was hooked. However I was a pretty broke 16 year old at the time and did not have a PS2 yet. So I had to wait a few months later until Christmas that year and my parents kindly got me one with a copy of DMC on Christmas Day. Needless to say I was hooked. I got my ass handed to me so bad by Phantom that I switched to Easy Automatic for the rest of my 1st playthrough. After I beat it though, I immediately replayed and cleared all difficulty levels.   Then DMC2 came around, and while initially excited, the reviews and word of mouth were less than praiseworthy so I skipped it until 2004 where my sister got it for me at a bargain price. Played through it once and never touched it again. Boy what a stinker. Then DMC3 came out during my spring break in 2005 and all was well with the world again. So awesome. When DMC4 came out in 2008, I didn’t have a PS3 yet so I got the PC version later. While not as good as 3, it was fun; I felt like it was a more technical game than 3 was, and as a result never finished it on all difficulties (something I hope to remedy with the SE out in a few weeks!). DmC? Hated it when I first heard about it, but at time went along I softened a bit and am currently playing it on PS3 since it was a PS+ title I snagged over a year ago. Up to mission 15 on that one. It’s not as bad as I thought but not up to the DMC standards set since 3:SE.   Now I sit and wait for what I hope will be a fifth title in the series!"
DevilMayCry,38fl1j,swordmalice,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"I got Devil May Cry 1 when I 6 years old (about a year after it's release), I found the game way too hard, ragequit on the first boss and returned the game.  A few months later I started having dreams about beating up enemies in Devil May Cry and it was really fun. So I went and bought the game again and thoroughly enjoyed it this time.  Got Devil May Cry 2 a few weeks after it came out and ragequit again but this time over how shit the sequel was, I should've returned this one as well but I didn't :(.  It took a lot of persuasion from a friend for me to try out DMC3 and by the time I got it DMC3SE was out so I got that and it was amazing!"
DevilMayCry,38fl1j,Perplexed_Comment,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:14:28 2015 UTC,I played the demo on the Code Veronica X disc and then found the actual game to be much harder. I've bought every game release except the original DmC for last gen
DevilMayCry,38fl1j,ShadowDonut,0,Thu Jun 11 16:00:23 2015 UTC,"when I was young I got my first taste of devil may cry 3. it was brief, enjoyable, and left me craving more. lots more. years later i'd get to play and finish it, then play as vergil because special edition. I loved it, played the hell out of it, enjoyed every second. well, then I decided to go back and play the others, so I played 2, thought ""My god this has to be an abortion that was allowed to live"" and reluctantly played 1. then I realized the reason 3 even existed, one was awesome, campy, different VA i found out (dante in dmc2 had so few lines that it never dawned on me that he'd spoken to begin with) and I found myself replaying it over and over again. finally four came out, and I thought, HELL YES. later I would come to regret those words, because nero made the game too easy and the game was pretty hard, as in, ridiculously hard. I stuck with it, finished it, and upon reflection thought to myself ""If I practice a lot at it, i'll enjoy this about as much as dmc3.  DmC came along and I was excited, I thought I was getting to play a younger, rebellious dante before his hair turned white. instead what I got was a reboot designed to shit on the franchise, but i heard vergil's downfall was in the works, and since the combat was kinda fun excepting the bosses sans barbas) I just kept grinding and practicing, and i found it a bit more fun the more I played.  downfall came along and my general experience was something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vtG0WpHM_Y  somehow downfall managed to be more fun than almost any devil may cry I've ever played, not sure how or why, but vergil as an input character was just a blast to play. I had a lot of fun, wound up putting up a lot of content on downfall and just having a good time all around. Now dmc4se is coming out. with playable vergil. who, I remind you, has been my favorite character through the series, regardless of incarnation.  I'm riding this hype train pretty hard."

DevilMayCry,38crer,TBAAAGamer1,2,Fri Jun 5 03:52:44 2015 UTC,"Hm. I actually put it up there intentionally to keep it out of the way and emphasize its functionality. It isn't related to links or searching for links so I think that may not be a good place to group it, if that makes sense.  In fact, isolating it seems to be the best way to make sure it's noticed. Of course, changing the wording back to DARK MODE could make it more obvious what it's for (although I am partial to the thematic naming).  I'll have to think about it and weigh the pros and cons a bit more."

Of course, I have read about some issues with newer versions of Naut, but it should definitely be a step up from the issues you're currently facing.

I'm still debating whether I should make the banner a bit shorter in order to get Kat to a reasonable height (and to give more space to the posts, of course).  At any rate, it's up for further modifications- the main goal today was to get the newest version of Naut in place as a framework for all the additions we'll be making as I collect feedback from this thread.  As far as the brick texture repeating all the way down the page goes, that could seriously hurt readability at the bottom of the page, and it could make the gaps in the layout unpleasant to look at, so I'm a bit resistant to the idea. Of course, creating a different brick texture with that in mind could make those issues less serious, so it's not outside the realm of possibility."

I was wondering if I can contribute, since I have some free time and would love to help and gain the experience."
DevilMayCry,38crer,ColdVergil,2,Thu Jun 4 00:33:24 2015 UTC,"No need to tweak HTML, PHP, or really even much Javascript as reddit handles the majority of the functionality. CSS is the majority of what you'd be working with, and we're using Naut which automates a great deal of it.  So mostly what I've done is a few tweaks on top of that theme to change things. After this initial revamp is worked out, I certainly wouldn't mind an extra set of eyes or someone willing to experiment with some alternative features.  If you want to get some decent experience quickly, I'd highly suggest heading over to http://w3schools.com/ and working on their examples and tweaking them to suit your tastes. If you're already comfortable with that, I suggest checking out /r/Naut or some other themes and playing around with them to familarize yourself with how reddit's CSS works (names of divs you would subclass, that sort of thing). If I feel a bit short on time and terrSC agrees, I'm sure we'd welcome any help to improve the sub."
DevilMayCry,38crer,ColdVergil,2,Thu Jun 4 01:49:32 2015 UTC,"I have messed around w3schools.com and codeacademy, so I'll give /r/Naut a try. That would be pretty cool if I can help, so thanks for letting me know. I'll continue messing with HTML and javascript, and I'll try to give you guys good feedback to change this subreddit.

Should we go with something like that or keep it full-color like what KirillianAmurawr has been working on here?  http://imgur.com/a/acmgM  I'm sure we could get them looking nice either way. I would probably do the full-color ones with a border of some sort and flat backgrounds instead of glowing halos to improve readability at a small size. Sort of like what /r/metalgear has going on. We could, of course, have both so long as their presentation is consistent and unobtrusive."

DevilMayCry,38eag4,mugendc4,3,Wed Jun 3 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"The DLC will likely be region-locked, but I assume a download code will be included with preorder copies. This is yet another reason for people to dislike DLC, as it often restricts the use of imported games."
DevilMayCry,38eag4,scionicspectre,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"UGH... Just to clarify, so you're saying even though if a code is included, it's still region locked and can't be used on a US console even if the game is imported."
DevilMayCry,38eag4,scionicspectre,2,Wed Jun 3 17:41:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. That's because you'll be using the U.S. version of the PlayStation Store, which will let you purchase or redeem codes for the U.S. There's no mechanism I'm aware of that allows you to redeem codes for a different region.  I suppose, with some trickery, you may be able to spoof your IP to connect to the Japanese store, but I think you would still need a Japanese PS4 in that scenario.  So yeah, I'm not entirely certain it's impossible, but I definitely wouldn't bet on it. Don't worry, we all think it's totally stupid, too.  EDIT: Check my later post- apparently it's not all that difficult to use the Japanese PSN on a U.S. console."
DevilMayCry,38eag4,scionicspectre,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:22:17 2015 UTC,"I heard about people creating a Japanese PSN account and downloading DLC for the imported game (which doesn't require you to have japanese IP address).  Do you happen to know if that is possible or it's still region locked based on console.  I know waaaay back when DMC4 demo was released in Japan first, I made a Japanese PSN account and downloaded before a US demo was released."
DevilMayCry,38eag4,scionicspectre,2,Wed Jun 3 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"This may be correct, although I don't know what procedure you would use to get to the Japanese Playstation Store on a U.S. PS4.  EDIT: http://tay.kinja.com/you-can-play-ps4s-japanese-exclusives-right-now-here-1523908351  Okay, maybe it is possible. Also, no need to get a prepaid card if you have a redeem code. If it works when the game releases, we should definitely have a tutorial of some kind."

DevilMayCry,38bt0z,ShiftyAxel,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:06:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, I actually just started talking to terrSC about this, so we may still make a thread of our own to hash things out in a more general sense. I actually have been brainstorming about a lot of the visually-oriented ideas you have here.  On the whole, I completely agree that the subreddit should be less generic and more DMCish. That is, themed up/downvote buttons, flairs, iconography in general, and a more cohesive color scheme are all things I'd love to do.  We should keep in mind, however, that the primary focus is readability and clear communication, so if it's ever a choice between something 'cool' and a legible layout, I'll prioritize the layout.  That's why I like your idea about using tags since it can help people quickly sift through the posts to find what they're most interested in. Of course, I'm more into symbolic communication so I'd probably want to use icons when possible. As for news, I'd probably just use the word itself since there's no globally recognized symbol for that I can immediately think of (and it's a short word). One point that we may disagree on is that I think we should keep the use of different colors to a minimum. Every color should have a distinct meaning and reinforce the others.  One last thing- I think there are a lot of potential up/downvote buttons, but if we went with a stylized SSS, D would do just as well for a downvote. Of course, I'd rather avoid text in an actionable button if possible. Keep the ideas coming!"

One point that we may disagree on is that I think we should keep the use of different colors to a minimum. Every color should have a distinct meaning and reinforce the others.   No!

On this subject, I'd like to see the header styling simplified.  Hiding the sub list top bar and username / link karma / unread messages display is a confusing design choice, particularly when you browse a lot of different subs that adhere to Reddit's default header layout.  That, and CSS :hover events don't work on mobile devices, so all of the above stay permanently hidden. I literally can't leave this sub on my tablet without typing in a new URL.  This could be fixed by adding support for the CSS :focus event and making the top bar semitransparent instead of invisible, but I'd still like to see a less customised layout for the sake of consistency."
DevilMayCry,38bt0z,scionicspectre,2,Wed Jun 3 11:11:10 2015 UTC,"Good point- this was in the default layout that was originally chosen for the subreddit 3 years ago, so it's definitely showing its age. So long as it's clean and unobtrusive, I have no problem keeping it permanently unhidden. This should be fairly easy to fix as soon as we update to naut 3.2 (we're currently using 1.0), which will likely happen when I start making all these changes.  By the way, there's an official thread for suggestions now if you'd like to pitch in there as well, but I'll definitely keep this in mind."

Either way, continuing. It's updating.  Edit: Not possible to add absolutely every boss from DMC2, they almost have no renders, from which can icon be created."
DevilMayCry,38bt0z,scionicspectre,2,Wed Jun 3 09:56:58 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, there's no real limit, but I'd like to keep it small so as to keep things organized. As mentioned elsewhere, I like the Metal Gear reddit's implementation as it allows you to mouse-over for the phrase rather than making it a permanent line beneath your username. But yeah, the most important thing is to make it noticeable without being distracting, so the smaller the better, really.  I was also thinking it could be interesting to have some that are more like lineart with the character's signature color to keep it light.  For example: http://imgur.com/a/GlkLe You may want to right-click to view the images with your browser since imgur's background is dark unlike the subreddit. Also, they'd be smaller than 100x100, but I think you get the idea."

It wouldn't be a bad idea to talk about what you guys want out of the sub that you're missing now, as we've been discussing how to get more engagement and less 'junk' posts.  Luckily, you guys have really stepped up your game as far as content goes over the past 5 months, so I think it's just a matter of making a few key improvements.

DevilMayCry,38a6xl,KevinLee487,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:18:37 2015 UTC,"Ironically, the previous banner only had DMC 4 represented, and that's why we changed it to something that represents the series as a whole. I think it could make sense to change the banner to reflect DMC 4: SE for a couple months, but we would eventually switch back to something that recognizes characters from each entry.  Of course, that would only bring up the question of why we didn't change the banner to something themed after DmC: DE when it came out."
DevilMayCry,38a6xl,Davidzeero,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:41:40 2015 UTC,"I meant more that the banner be updated to include the special edition, not that it be the only thing"
DevilMayCry,38a6xl,scionicspectre,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:54:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Although I made the banner before Trish and Lady were known to be playable, it already gives them decent focus. Do you have any specific ideas for how we could bring more focus to the Special Edition?  I mean, we could use Vergil's new ingame model or some of the costume artwork to make it more focused on the remaster without giving the banner a complete overhaul. Of course, that has its own problems, as you could argue the existing artwork is more iconic, and I did choose the poses specifically to help group the characters (one in the middle, two facing away).  Either way, I'm open to suggestions. I definitely want to pump up the hype until it reaches SSS."
DevilMayCry,38a6xl,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:49:29 2015 UTC,I kind of agree. We could definitely get a better pic of Dante and Vergil's is outdated at this point.

DevilMayCry,38a6xl,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:37:46 2015 UTC,"A few people have brought up that Vergil has new artwork (he even has the same pose, in fact).  Although this banner was made around the time of DMC 4: SE's announcement when we didn't have any good images to use, I still think Vergil's concept art from DMC 3 does a good job of portraying Vergil in terms of the series. The goal of the banner was originally to help represent each title in the series in some meaningful way.  Of course, if we reach a consensus that Vergil's new art would work better, I'm fine replacing it. It would, of course, make Lucia's inclusion look even stranger as she would be the only prerendered image up there."

DevilMayCry,3858m5,TBAAAGamer1,3,Tue Jun 2 05:25:41 2015 UTC,"He pretty much gets to the heart of the matter. can't really disagree with many of his points. but they're all based on the assumption that this game was meant to be the new devil may cry. which, sadly, it was. I always treat it like a spinoff, because to me, that's all it is, a spinoff with physics combo focused combat and an in depth tutorial. also, a lot of what this guy says is biased to pandering. like his analysis of the music is way off, it's not dubstep, and his friend points out that it's ""Badly done dubstep.""   this is because it isn't. it's industrial.  His analysis of the story is entirely spot on though. best element of his review."
DevilMayCry,3858m5,scionicspectre,2,Tue Jun 2 16:07:39 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you're so chill about this- good attitude. It is nice that this review, despite its tone, actually does a good job of backing itself up. Many people who talk about DmC in this way are far more derogatory and feel their idea of the game is self-explanatory.  I'm glad to see that we can promote people with more articulate views on the subject instead of just dealing with raging haters. It makes this niche community a better place on the whole."
DevilMayCry,3858m5,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:48:39 2015 UTC,"Crying about hate over a game where hate isn't justified isn't going to do anything about how people perceive the game. I know the game is good for what it is, that's enough for me. I will argue critical elements, but I'm not going to just break down and start shouting ""You just hayt DmC becuz ur wayrin roze culured gla$$es dmc3 fanboyz shud git over demselves!!""  that doesn't support a critical argument, it's proof that you weren't thinking about your argument enough to reasonably support it to begin with, have run out of ideas and reasonable defenses, and as a result, no longer have an argument.  and remember, the exact same thing can also be said of DMC3/4 fans when they rip on DmC, they also lack a proper argument, usually boiling it down to ""donte sucks"" or ""it's too casual and simple!"" ""I'll agree with the simple part, and the casual part, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad game. it makes it a bad devil may cry. but it's good for what it does, just okay. except for the graphics, my god have you ever played DmC on PC? it looks amazing. better than 4, the animations are just a tad stiff."
DevilMayCry,3858m5,scionicspectre,2,Wed Jun 3 14:17:22 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, DmC on PC with downsampling is the bomb. The visuals are some of the best I've seen in Unreal Engine 3, in fact, and a lot of that is due to art direction, not necessarily the engine.  I think the Japanese studios tend do a better job when it comes to the technical aspects of optimizing 3D models, however. That's not really a knock of Ninja Theory so much as it is high praise for Itsuno's team."

DevilMayCry,3841m8,Diabel_Hanta,9,Mon Jun 1 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"My top five:   5 - Credo  4 - Nevan 3 - Dante - DMC 4 2 - Doppelganger shadow 1 - Vergil final fight Mission 20; ONE OF THE MOST EPIC BATTLES IN GAMING   Also, If Vergil and Dante were to fight cannonically(impossible tho') in DMC 4 daaamn XD"
DevilMayCry,3841m8,ColdVergil,7,Mon Jun 1 18:33:00 2015 UTC,"All right. Here we go.   5 Berial 1 (DMC 4). The sense of scale in this fight was amazing. Compared to Berial, Nero is a shrimp.You get a really good feeling of what you're up against, especially as Berial is such a calculating fighter,  sizing you up ever so often before he strikes.  4 - Cerberus (DMC 3) The 1st boss battle of (arguably) the series' best entry is a no-holds barred, put-up-or-shut-up awesome fight. In its original release, this fight was notoriously difficult in the West due to the ""Normal"" version being the Japanese equivalent of ""Hard"". On a first play through with no health upgrades, Dante could be killed in less than 8-10 hard hits. Ouch. A fantastic way to introduce the game and tease at the level of insane fights that would follow. 3 - Griffon 3 (DMC 1) What better setting for a fight with this honorable veteran demon than a Colosseum? The shift in strategy after the first phase of the fight keeps you on your toes. Then once you defeat him, your feelings about him change once you witness his final fate...definitely an emotional fight, perhaps one of the few in the series overall. 2 Nelo Angelo 3 (DMC 1). Another emotional one; Dante comes face to face with Nelo who resembles a certain someone from his past, literally! He takes off his mask and reveals the face underneath. By this point the game expects the player to be of a certain skill level and Nelo goes all out on this one. Hope you studied up from the previous fights or it'll be a quick and painless death for you. 1 Vergil 3 (DMC 3) No question; this was the most epic final battle in the series. The sense of tension, the realization that the twin brothers perhaps still share a strong sense of sibling love and admiration for one another and the way it resolves leaves an indelible mark on you. The definition of what a final boss fight should be."
DevilMayCry,3841m8,swordmalice,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:59:25 2015 UTC,"I'm super late, but I really liked your descriptions for all these bosses you mentioned!

Sorry again for the late reply just wanted to say this..."
DevilMayCry,3841m8,swordmalice,2,Thu Jun 25 19:26:09 2015 UTC,Better late than never! And thank you OP for the thread; it gave me some good nostalgia while looking back on my time with the series.

DevilMayCry,3841m8,gazamcnulty,4,Thu Jun 25 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"1 - Vergil 1 hands down. The atmosphere and soundtrack is perfect. This is also the very first time you fight someone on Dante's level that isn't some slow obscure Knight or gigantic monstrosity. Hes fast, hes brutal, badass and he doesn't screw around. The 3rd battle just didn't have the feel that the first one did. Its more brutal, but becomes monotonous when he decides to spam Helm Breaker (Though this can be fun when playing as Vergil if you time your own trick ups and Helm Breakers, it becomes a DBZ battle) and Final Judgment Cut since they're far too easy to avoid.   2- Dante. Its always intense fighting a small boss in DMC because they can trip you up very easily due to their abilities not being as easy to predict. Dante is just in another league. Things will be all fine and dandy while you deflect each others bullets, parry sword swings and dodge each other like crazy. Then Dante gets fed up and just ends you with Pandora reminding you that HE is the star of DMC even though you've been playing as Nero for the past few hours.  3- Phantom. The first boss we ever encounter and he is just plain fun to fight. A gigantic molten Spider/Scorpion thing? You always feel like a king after deflecting his Fireball right back at his face.  4- Credo. Whenever I fight Credo as Nero, it feels like I'm watching art. His attacks come in at perfect intervals to make the fight extremely intense but not overbearing. Catching his spears with the Devil Bringer is very satisfying as well.  5- Agni&Rudra. Double boss battle? Hell yes. You always have to keep track of the one you aren't fighting and be ready to dodge/counter in an instant."
DevilMayCry,3841m8,TheKiwiJames,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:29:22 2015 UTC,"Those bosses man... :*(  1- I know exactly how you feel with the first boss encounter with Vergil. The atmosphere with the rainfall and Vergil's hair looking like Dante's hair was pretty epic! Especially how the cutscene slowly lead to the battle music was genius! :D  3 - When I faced against Phantom I died many times already and the game was ""trolling"" me by giving me the option of easy (automatic)... After trying so much against Phantom and then finally beating him felt very rewarding, and I knew from there that I'd love Devil May Cry. He is one of my favorite bosses of all time, since he was the first boss and already made me pissed."
DevilMayCry,3841m8,xirog,5,Tue Jun 2 03:18:43 2015 UTC,5 Griffon 4 beowulf 3 credo 2 mundus 1 Vergil   Mundus seems to be getting neglected here the epicness of the build up to that fight and the fight itself is without equal. But of course the 3rd Vergil fight in dmc3 is the best fight in the series. I remember it took me months to beat him on DMD mode.
DevilMayCry,3841m8,NimbleBrain,3,Mon Jun 1 23:29:37 2015 UTC,5 - Cerberus because he was an awesome first boss.  4 - Berial because he was set to become Mundus's heir which added to his oomph.  3 - Mundus because there's something about wrecking the demon emperors life while taking the form of your father that is just satisfying.  2 - Nevan because my first few times fighting her motivated me to go back through some levels and actually learn how to play DMC3 properly.  1 - Vergil 3 because Vergil is at his peak and it just makes for an excellent fight where a little screw up could lose you half your hp.
DevilMayCry,3841m8,Davidzeero,2,Tue Jun 2 03:07:49 2015 UTC,5- Berial  4- Credo  3- Beowulf  2- Dante (As Nero)  1- Vergil (Final DMC3 fight)
DevilMayCry,3841m8,TBAAAGamer1,2,Mon Jun 1 20:29:04 2015 UTC,"I'm genuinely surprissd by all the Berials. It was pretty shit design imo.  The first time you encounter him, you can't defend yourself while in the air very well (no DT invincibility, no charge shot 3, etc.). So what did the level designer do? Put green orbs everywhere so that what should have been an epic encounter turned into a brainless button mash. Absolutely disgusting.  Berial's the only boss that I still can't read well in DMC4 as a result since I've never had to really know his patterns until later."

DevilMayCry,37vjhq,ShiftyAxel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"I mean his combos have more variations. you can to a lot of ground juggles that simply aren't possible in dmc4 because the physics are focused on air combos, there ARE instances where you can casually ground juggle an enemy, but it's clear that the game wasn't intentionally designed to keep them airborne like that with the ground moves. DmC you can juggle an enemy on the ground with pretty much every move, this leads to some interesting juggle combo setups. I'm not saying DmC is more complex than 4, it's just not, but its juggle physics were fun and expanded the groundwork from 3 and 4."
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,KevinLee487,12,Sat May 30 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"That just sounds like its designed to make bad players feel like they're doing awesome combos.

DevilMayCry,37vjhq,KevinLee487,1 point,Sun May 31 03:32:48 2015 UTC,Or perhaps the moment your style rank increases to S you can do those combos because S ranking enhances your ability to use the juggle state. I'm just puzzling over how merging the physics with the game could work without detracting from it.
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,KevinLee487,7,Sat May 30 22:48:56 2015 UTC,That still sounds like a crutch for bad players and bad idea overall. That would lock certain combos behind the style meter which limits the earlier part of your combos.
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,KevinLee487,0,Sat May 30 22:56:11 2015 UTC,"true, but those combos could still be present if say, certain conditions were met. say for example, instead of being a ""secret glitch mechanic"" jump canceling was an actual thing that, if done enough times reliably, could put an enemy in a stun state for a few hits that made them bounce around like that for enhanced juggling? you get to nerf the DmC juggle physics so that only skilled players could open up those opportunities, and it would require that you know the timing well enough to put an enemy in that state to begin with. the idea i'm trying to mull over is, could it be done without sacrificing the hardcore nature of the game?"
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,Dreceratops,3,Sat May 30 22:45:16 2015 UTC,"true, but those combos could still be present if say, certain conditions were met. say for example, instead of being a ""secret glitch mechanic"" jump canceling was an actual thing that, if done enough times reliably, could put an enemy in a stun state for a few hits that made them bounce around like that for enhanced juggling?   Which good JCers do not need. If you can time your JCs properly, the enemy never gets to hit the ground anyway. So they essentially do get stunned.   you get to nerf the DmC juggle physics so that only skilled players could open up those opportunities   There doesn't need to be the kind of juggle physics you're talking about anyway. What we have in DMC4 is perfectly fine.   Every idea you've posted will do nothing more than decrease the skill gap. Merging the two series is just a bad idea, I'm sorry man.  DmC's combat and physics work in DmC because the combos and enemies were designed around it. They would not work in the real DMC without a vast overhaul which we do not want or need."
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,ColdVergil,1 point,Sat May 30 23:00:55 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is that there is literally nothing we can implement from DmC's juggle system that could work in a classic devil may cry?

DevilMayCry,37vjhq,Warsc2k,8,Sat May 30 23:10:00 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is that there is literally nothing we can implement from DmC's juggle system that could work in a classic devil may cry?   Yes. The entire game was made to cater to a new audience who has never played Devil May Cry and its obvious.
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,ColdVergil,1 point,Sat May 30 23:26:10 2015 UTC,fair enough then.
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,ColdVergil,3,Sat May 30 23:33:30 2015 UTC,"What do you exactly mean by ""physics system?"" I hate how DmC handles jump canceling, is that part of the physics system? Do you mean the properties of specific weapons? Because those properties could be carried into future games if that's what you mean. Personally, I enjoyed DMC 3's physics the most in the series. There's a noticeable and weirdly satisfying ""arc"" when jump canceling, which you sometimes you get in DMC 4, and is just impossible in DmC."
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,ColdVergil,0,Sat May 30 20:51:09 2015 UTC,"I mean how enemies react to attacks, unlike say, dmc3 or 4 where they gravitate to the ground the closer to the ground they're in, DmC's enemies have a tendency to bounce around. they can be sent flying in various directions by the strength of certain attacks or even be held in place by things like the charged shots. heck, some attacks can keep them elevated right above you. this was fun, and it lead to some interesting juggles. jump canceling in DmC was bad, i hated doing it as dante, vergil's was a bit more bearable, but even then I preferred sword canceling to jump canceling. what I'm getting at is, keep the juggling physics from DmC, but don't make it AS easy to do. Keeping an enemy airborne, manipulating enemies into flying into an explosion you've set up, there was something really satisfying about that. dmc3 enemies as I remember them, didn't juggle very well, dmc4 enemies had a sort of ""flat juggling"" to them, you could keep them airborne in dmc4 with the rose and certain attacks, but they'd never really be sent flying in certain directions by the same attacks from a different angle, save for lucifer explosions, and even then you couldn't follow up the way you could in dmc by chasing after them to continue a juggle."
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,ColdVergil,3,Sat May 30 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"NO NO NO NO NO NO.  You kidding me mate, the amount of stuff you can do with Dante in DMC 4 is beyond  DmC way too much. I've been practicing now watching tutorials and stuff and holy shit, it's hard yes but that encourages to keep practicing. DmC is more of a how can I say this hmmm hit this button and do this and combine it with this DONE. I mean you just watch the loading screen and there's a combo. Anyone can do it. You don't really have to work as hard as DMC 4 to pull out some amazing shit.  Dude seriously Jump canceling in DmC it's easy as fuuuuck. I got used to it and when I came back to DMC 4 I literally couldn't jump cancel again. Had to practice a lot. The satisfaction that you get by doing awesome stuff in DMC 4(notice flying guard) is way bigger than anything on DmC.  I really don't see how can you do ''MORE'' in DmC plus if you get blue enemies and red enemies and you make a mistake then you fuck up.  And if you don't think DmC it's easy, well, you just literally turn on the devil trigger and everyone is set floating in the air just like that I mean c'mon...  Dude just look at this and tell there are not a lot of variations for DMC 4."

I seriously played a lot of DmC but I don't see it. I'm open to see what stuff are you talking about just to try it but from my point of view DmC is way too easy."
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,IAmTriscuit,1 point,Sat May 30 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"Dante never had a dropping attack that launched for starters, he also lacked a projectile based melee weapon that sustained a juggle state. he couldn't do an inverse rainstorm, he doesn't have a charged shot that juggles, nor does his shotgun sustain a juggle state. (I think his fireworks does though) lucifer, while a good physics manipulation tool, didn't have the dedicated juggle inertia manipulation of kablooey, or rather, it isn't quite as reliable. a single explosion from kablooey is often used to put enemies in line with a followup attack for a long combo.  revenant bombs only have a counterpart in nero, but you can't stack them or keep them charged as nero, and dante had no options to that effect. a revenant bomb stack could maintain a juggle and allow for...a just charged gauntlet followup.  some attacks from new dante's rebellion can send an enemy flying, which could then be followed up by a juggled shot or cancel. enemies could actually be put into a juggle state by a canceled inverted rainstorm into drop, etc.  the vid I posted above shows a lot of cool stuff that can be done in DmC that I think could carry over into dmc5 without casualizing it.  for instance, I don't think it's possible to replicate the kablooey setup at 1:03 or the other one shortly after that at 1:06 likewise the part at 1:50 probably doesn't have an equivalent in the classics, but it's extremely complex and shows that a lot of gun cancels were required to make it happen all the way to 2:04 to say nothing of the inverted rainstorm cancel at the beginning. Finally, the classics have a sorely limited ""ground juggle"" system, the enemies hit the ground too fast and leave fewer opportunities to do anything. at 2:48 there's a ground juggle sequence that I think could be implemented without sacrificing the hardcore elements of the game, might be stretching that a bit though.  I'd love to have this craziness to be POSSIBLE in a classic devil may cry. not easy to do, but at least doable. I'm not saying dmc4 isn't complex, dear god is it complex, but there could be more. a lot more. and DmC has stuff that simply isn't in 4. but it could be in 5 without removing the hardcore nature of the game."
DevilMayCry,37vjhq,Mikolos,3,Sat May 30 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"Ah now I see... But this is completely relative. This ''juggling'' is good for you but I see it as an easy way to play. I'd hate this style appearing on a DMC 5. This is just simply keeping enemies in air, which you can do by just jump cancelling. I'm sorry but I do like challenging stuff and if this is added to DMC 5 goodbye challenges... Lucifer has enough ''juggle'' inertia. It has darts and those darts explode when you hit back+Style. Kablooey was a pain in the ass wep to be honest didn't like it, if you forget Kablooey's dart you're fucked, while Lucifer's explode after a while.  Inverse rainstorm for me it does not suit Dante. Either way as I was saying this is entirely relative, while I do respect what you're saying, I don't share it.  This ''juggling'' of DmC would make DMC way too easy."

DevilMayCry,37lpk5,TBAAAGamer1,5,Thu May 28 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"Combat is the core to DMC as a franchise, so most of my complaints are about the mechanics.  The core of everything that made DmC feel worse was the lack of lock-on. This had two giant, negative effects:   No indication of what enemy I would hit: I mean, it works a lot of the time, but double-forwards stingers aren't the most precise controls in the world. Fighting ground and air enemies with similar x and y coordinates got real annoying real fast, and when the game has color coded enemies that make your attacks bounce off, not knowing which enemy I'm targeting is unacceptable. The crowding of the controller: Sure, dedicated launcher is definitely easier and more accessible, but a single attack doesn't need it's own button. The double-forwards stinger has no redeeming features, and is a garbage input. I hated it in Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, I hated it in DmC, it just doesn't feel good. Lock-on+direction+input adds a weird, physical layer of satisfaction to the game, something that few other games have.  By removing lock-on, you get one easier, more accessible input, but then you have to add a dumb stinger input, a dedicated dodge button(s), double thumbstick Devil Trigger, and gun special. The DMC dodge could be improved, but in no way did it need it's own dodge button (see DMC 2), and Trickster already was an improved dodge that also had an air dodge. By having a dedicated launcher, they removed the style button, the button that could have replaced dodge and gun special and added some much needed controller space.   On the surface, DmC Dante has the most weapons at one time out of all the DMC games, but each weapon really only has half the moves. Melee, double-forwards melee, and launcher compared to melee, forwards-melee, backwards melee, style, forwards-style, and backwards-style. On the same amount of buttons, DmC Dante can only do half the melee moves of previous Dante + Sword Master. Gunslinger could've replaced gun special and added forwards and backwards inputs. The Demon and Angel evades are cool, but don't justify the entire stance system and could be replaced with trickster. And Royal Guard could exist.   To respond to your points specifically,    Without lock-on, dedicated launcher was probably the best any designer could do, but I really do hope the game was designed to accommodate for the stance system and not because they legitimately thought no lock-on and dedicated launch was better. I like it, but I would free up some space and make it the style button again any day of the week.  Fuck that finicky input. But really, they could have normal lock-on inputs and allow the double-direction inputs as alternatives, and it would make reversing stingers a lot easier.  I have no idea what you're talking about here. High-level Lucifer pin setups are insane and might be one of the least developed parts of DMC 4 combos. They can do similar things while also having melee properties and are much more versatile than Kablooey. I'm pretty sure the rest of the guns have similar juggling properties in all of the DMC games as well. Something I would like to see iterated upon are the useful charge-shots which actually do something instead of doing more damage. I'd also like to see charge-shot canceling be included in future titles as well.  Most of the aesthetic and design stuff was really cool, and watching Limbo sprout and collapse stuff was pretty cool the first time around, and we finally got a game with tolerable platforming. But on every play-through after that, I'm skipping those cutscenes or I'm in Bloody Palace or training.    I more or less agree with your other points, but some additions:   On top of all the stuff you mentioned about the smaller enemies, only two of the bosses were actually enjoyable. Vergil was an all around good fight, but the first good mechanical boss was the last boss of the game. Bob Barbas had a really neat aesthetic, but he, and a lot of other bosses felt gimmicky. The constant tiny cutscenes didn't help either.  Also includes 3 and 4. I watch cutscenes the first time through, then just try to get good at the game. The main difference between DmC and the originals is that I will sometimes watch a cutscene from the original games because I enjoyed them, but rewatching one from DmC only makes me sigh or roll my eyes."
DevilMayCry,37lpk5,Dreceratops,0,Thu May 28 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"Lucifer shouldn't be the only weapon to do that, also, the physics system in dmc4 is much harder to take advantage of, even with lucifer.  Lucifer has a LOT of potential, but the guns in DmC pretty much trump what it was trying to do in the first place, which is explosive juggling. revenant bombs were reliable juggle tools that could be used for some sick setups as well as combo extenders kablooey darts, while basically a poor man's lucifer, used the physics system better than lucifer did, one dart could send an enemy flying in whatever direction, and you could setup some pretty cool ground juggles when you finally got the hang of it. also, the finisher for that gun looks ballin. Ebony and ivory's charged shots had a lot of casual combo juggle potential, especially when you factored in the just charge, and the gun cancels were pretty much dante's best cancel with those guns. he could even gun cancel inverted rainstorm for some pretty cool followups. they were quite flexible when used alongside the weapons.  I do not defend the lack of a lock-on, what I'd like to see is the double tap inputs put in as well as there being a lock-on system. I don't like that you HAVE to lock-on to perform those inputs, there really needs to be a way to do it. and DmC's soft lock wasn't really that bad, it did have some moments though."
DevilMayCry,37lpk5,ColdVergil,4,Thu May 28 20:36:49 2015 UTC,"Well gameplay was fine, for new players, it was easier to get into DMC stuff.   Story is completely crap and the dialogue is even worse. Characters are just like put out of Tumblr. The only character who looked serious enough was the guy without the eye. Oh and Kat was kinda neutral too so I guess that's good.  Im also still hating the flip twice forward Stinger.  Vergil gameplay was let's say normal but far better than Dante, only thing I didn't like was the ''heavy'' color coded sword. Color coded enemies in this game... That was a bitch move"
DevilMayCry,37lpk5,FarAsYouCanThrowMe,2,Thu May 28 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"Practice mode, practice mode, practice mode.  I did like some of the level design. That's about it."
DevilMayCry,37lpk5,kampasta,2,Thu May 28 23:57:16 2015 UTC,"The one failing of the original style button was that a lot of moves were shoved onto a distinct button, robbing precious button space, when most of them could have been standard inputs. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to do twosome time or gunstinger with your basic shoot button and direction inputs. Trickster and royalguard felt fine using it, but gunslinger and sword master were just artificially inflating the amount of space they felt like hogging on the controller  DmC took this mistake 5 steps further and removed styles so that back + attack could be its own button. Then it scooped out two buttons for roll. I hear people claiming that the style abilities are alive and well in DmC, and that may be true if you were only ever a sword master, but as someone who started gunslinger and then moved to royalguard main in 3, those people can eat a dick.   Then the level design. Much prettier, but much shittier to play. DmC once again takes an aspect of DMC that was always terrible, makes the whole game about that thing, and then makes it so much worse, under the insane belief that people actually enjoyed platforming segments,  grapple puzzles, and key fetching in the original games. Those were the worst things in the game, and a reboot would have certainly been more welcome if all those obnoxious misplaced puzzle elements were removed. Did that happen? No -- there are entire levels that are just platform grappling, with like one optional fight, and one even discourages fighting by making me race a timer while I grapple. I'll sit through 10 minutes of heavy handed unskippable exposition from a character the writers have completely failed to make me care about, and at the end of this, the reward for my patience is a giant grapple platform room.  Even boss fights are glorified grapple puzzles, made worse by constant unskippable cutscene interruption. It would be okay if this was an important cutscene (like vergil suddenly joining your fight in DMC3, that was worth the interrupt) but what does DmC cockblock my combo for? To hear the boss call dante a cunt. But we can't have a taunt button, because that would feel out of character  They keep saying that DmC is a combat focused game, but if that was true, why do they keep putting combat in the back seat to make me swing on ziplines and listen to characters drone on about why they don't trust ""the man"" anymore?"

DevilMayCry,37lpk5,Warsc2k,0,Fri May 29 16:31:45 2015 UTC,very interesting points.
DevilMayCry,37lpk5,Illidan1943,2,Fri May 29 15:20:15 2015 UTC,"Dedicated launch button   Nah, rip styles and lock-on/double-tap does the job well enough. Stinger -> Million Stabs -> E&I -> Prop -> Anything to follow-up is a great combo, and it serves as a great replacement in the air for back-forwards. That's all there is to it, though. I want muh RG, TS, SM and GS back.   Double tap inputs   Yay, because you can reverse attacks easier (DMC4's reversed attacks buffering rustled my jimmies). I don't see a downside to that.   Guns with better juggle properties for creative combo setups   Hello? Isn't this obvious? Even more creativity in a DMC game? Higher skill cap? Yes. Also, I'm glad you didn't forget that combo mad. It should be brought up everytime someone talks about guns and their properties.   Sick level design.   Thematically speaking, I didn't enjoy the factory. I loved the dance club even though the wubtastic soundtrack and the plethora of warm-coloured lights make it pretty hard to see particles/effects.   the enemies   So we have:   Basic ground enemy #1  Basic ground enemy #1 with a shield  Basic ground enemy #1, blue.  Basic ground enemy #1, blue, with a shield  Basic ground enemy #1, red.  Basic ground enemy #1, red, with a shield  Basic ground enemy #1, recoloured with Crawler (Agni and Rudra)  Basic air enemy #1  Basic air enemy #1, crossbow.  Basic air enemy #1 with a shield  Basic air enemy #1, crossbow, with a shield  Harpy  Annoying fat guy  Guy wielding a chainsaw  Annoying ninja  Annoying ninja with a red mask.   ....no..   The dialogue   Filling dark souls with light, telling featherfaces to flock off and making parties get crazy aren't things that make the dialogue good.  Except Vergil-sama. Vorgin ruined him and I'm salty as fuck.    The story   Better than super-pope's crusade imo.   The characters   short black hair, edgy edgy."
DevilMayCry,37lpk5,Zuke88,1 point,Thu May 28 18:36:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, the super pope's crusade was just an excuse to introduce nero. or, looking at it another way, it was an excuse to watch nero beat the shit out of the pope with the devil buster for big damage in his infuriating boss fight. I still think a dedicated launch button could be a thing if the style button could be moved somewhere sensible, like....replacing the gun button. I hear a lot of people move the gun inputs to the bumpers anyway for more accessible charged shots, so win win. also, remember i'm not just talking about the launch, the dedicated launch also divided up some of their counterpart's more complex commands in DmC, like round trip and so forth. I think that perhaps a dedicated launch button could be given other functions depending on inputs. basically, make use of the other buttons, give a simpler input system to certain abilities as well as make room for some new ones."
DevilMayCry,37lpk5,ColdVergil,1 point,Thu May 28 20:30:09 2015 UTC,"Dedicated launch button: Was this a good idea?   No, the only alternative that works is Bayonetta/MGR launchs: some combos end on a launcher, a dedicated launch button hurts the game a lot   Double tap inputs   As long as it is like Bayonetta where I can use both systems, sure   Guns with better juggle properties for creative combo setups   Sure, keep it, would give a better reason to charge Evory & Ivory since damage was nerfed to hell in DMC4 and if they want to keep it that way I won't have much problem if they changed properties to the charge attacks   Sick level design.   Eh... I hated DmC's level design, they went more for cool looking levels with obvious secret zones but they were extremely linear and don't feel as good as Temen ni Gru or Mallet Island's castle   the enemies   No... just no   The dialogue   Hell no, I want my cheese Dante back   The story   No   The characters   More characters designed by teenagers, no thank you"

DevilMayCry,37eamg,sujinjian,7,Wed May 27 02:02:16 2015 UTC,"The problem with DmC: Devil May Cry is not that it was a bad game, but that it has the name 'Devil May Cry' on it, which makes comparisons to the other four games unavoidable. As someone who prefers the main series (1-4), I can say it isn't half a bad game, its rather fun and enjoyable (especially when one makes puns and reaction faces from it every once in a while), but as a Devil May Cry game, it falls just a bit upper than DMC2, if only because the latter is bland and boring as Hell (even if it implemented stuff that made its return in DMC3 and stayed and also presented some actually cool designs, including a great OST that I admit I listen to even more than DMC3's) which for any game is not allowed, and also because it did introduce a neat concept such as the active environments for the game (just imagine Hell's influence actively shaping the world on the game into a more harsh and dangerous environment). Music is not my cup of tea tho (well, maybe the hard metal that pops up every once in a while but not screamo or dubstep in general) and writting sometimes throws in a shitty dialog or two every now and then, but still is a fun game. Is just not a good (or bad even) Devil May Cry."

Ignoring the story and all the media nonsense, the gameplay just took too many steps back. DMC had a 10+ year pedigree, yet DmC removed key features that were in the very first game. Sure, DmC wasn't bad, but I can't look at Hotline Miami 2 or Dark Souls 2 without looking at the previous games, so I can't overlook DmC failing to innovate, improve, or even keep the same quality of combat 3-4 (they even managed to make DMC 2's mistake of having a dedicated dodge button) previous games."

DevilMayCry,37d000,KevinLee487,1 point,Tue May 26 18:55:41 2015 UTC,I thought it was actually pretty funny at some points. The only thing I would suggest is to get your mom to actually read the dialogue during cutscenes so she would have a little bit better of an idea of whats going on.  Oh and DMC takes place in America.
DevilMayCry,37d000,xirog,2,Tue May 26 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we'll try to say silent during cutscenes so we actually catch everything.  And damn, thought it might have been America.  Guess DmC got me confused on the lore/setting because of the Union Jack arm."
DevilMayCry,37d000,Perplexed_Comment,5,Tue May 26 22:20:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say you have to be silent, but there was a few times where the cutscene dialogue and action was largely ignored. For example, when Vergil kills the Hell Vanguard on top of the tower.   Other than that though, I still enjoyed it enough to watch all of the episodes."
DevilMayCry,37d000,Davidzeero,2,Tue May 26 22:25:10 2015 UTC,"I'd second that, try getting more into the lore from the cutscenes! That, and try alternating combos and stuff. Already subscribed, will be glad to watch the whole playtrough!"

I'm curious about Nevan as well, though since we already played Bayonetta, I can't imagine it will be anything that special.  And yeah, with how many other games we're playing, I'll probably upload a DMC3 episode once every third day or so after the 4th part tomorrow.  Not counting one-offs and stuff (probably going to do Splatoon on Friday or Saturday), but for the most part we'll stick to that schedule."

I'm not taking the ""sole heir to my chaotic vergil style"" comment back though, that WAS priceless.

DevilMayCry,37dqns,Scatter5D,10,Tue May 26 21:53:33 2015 UTC,Berial states that he hasn't been to the Human world in 2000 years. (which means that he obviously isn't talking about any of the current cast of DMC)  2000 years ago was when Sparda was kicking ass and taking names.   Berial could only be referring to Sparda and his human size compared to other powerful demons which have been traditionally far larger than humans.
DevilMayCry,37dqns,KevinLee487,8,Wed May 27 00:02:32 2015 UTC,I'm assuming Berial meant Sparda due to the fact Berial had most likely fought against Sparda whereas he probably doesn't know anything about Vergil. As for Dante almost every demon knows who he is after defeating Mundus.
DevilMayCry,37dqns,TheKiwiJames,3,Tue May 26 23:14:26 2015 UTC,"Didn't even remember that quote. The first tought would be Sparda, but it could be another hint at Vergil being his father indeed.  Don't think it could be Dante though, since Dante fights him after Nero does."

DevilMayCry,37a7yn,cleansolo,16,Tue May 26 03:10:34 2015 UTC,"Originally he resented him as evidenced by his dialogue in DMC3  Vergil - ""Why do you refuse to gain power? The power of our father Sparda""  Dante -""Heh. I don't have a father. I just don't like you, that's all.""  But it seems by the time of DMC1, he respected Sparda since he vowed to kill Mundus in the name of his father."
DevilMayCry,37a7yn,KevinLee487,6,Tue May 26 03:14:47 2015 UTC,"He didn't at the start of 3, but did at the end"
DevilMayCry,37a7yn,kampasta,4,Tue May 26 04:33:51 2015 UTC,He started out not caring about him (likely because he hardly ever saw him considering his likely bad upbringin with demons killing his mom and stuff) but after his fight with Lady he started accepting his bonds to his family and said something about Spardas human soul in the end in a way that leaves the impression that he considered him a good person.
DevilMayCry,37a7yn,DeathDevilize,3,Tue May 26 07:06:32 2015 UTC,"Adding on to what everyone else is saying, you can also see that in the beginning of 3 he didn't know of how the amulets were gifts from him to the humans, but Vergil did."
DevilMayCry,37a7yn,xirog,3,Tue May 26 14:24:54 2015 UTC,"the overall consensus on this is that, to dante, sparda was just some important demon who made a bunch of messes while trying to save the world.  he respects what sparda was trying to do, he just hates being stuck with the angry enemies of sparda, the demons and people who crave his power, and the fact that stupid people now worship him. and sure, he was dante's father, but there's this implication of detachment, like, even if that's true, sparda's dead now so it doesn't matter. the guy couldn't protect dante, and dante had to deal with the messes his old man left behind. one could argue that his ""cleaning up"" of these messes is a labor of love, but he doesn't exactly come bounding out the gates to find every single loose end sparda failed to tie up either."

It's hard to appreciate what a massive leap in quality DMC3 was without first experiencing where the series could have gone in DMC2. Not only did 3 save the series, but you come to realize that there were actually things worth saving that DMC2 introduced.  If you do have it on your list, definitely get it out of the way early, so you don't finish on a downer. It's still terrible, but good to play once just so you get some perspective"
DevilMayCry,373sl0,kampasta,12,Sun May 24 17:53:07 2015 UTC,"By not playing 2 or even considering it part of the canon. kinda like how people treat DmC, only with more vehemence."

DevilMayCry,373sl0,Warsc2k,3,Sun May 24 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"Let me be clear on this so we can understand one another. I do not hate DmC or DMC I hate how DmC was presented to the fans of an old and respectable franchise. I hate how it was being treated as a hardcore installment in the franchise when it should have been treated as an easier, less gratifying but more fun game that focused on making combos easier. (I.E.I. a spinoff game) I LOVED the level design, i loved the complexity of its physics system, which had potential enough to trump dmc4 (yes, the physics and inertia was better than dmc4's, but only by a little.)  I loved DmC for what it did right, and hate it for what it kept trying to be, a replacement, or superior to its counterpart. it's not, and i will never see it as an equal to dmc3 and 4. ever. I will not, however, overlook a good game when I see one, and from a gameplay and level design standpoint, DmC was good. not great. but good. and yes warsc2k, I want to be your pal too, but if my friendship is so cheap that my opinion of a game can shatter it, then what's the point in even asking?  This is the gameplay we were getting with DmC when a truly skilled player goes to town with it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21ko55LKeE and it shames me that the only thing keeping people from liking DmC is the fact that the devs designed this title to shit on its own franchise. waste of good gameplay potential I say. and it IS good. it's just not better than DMC3/4 in fact, i'd just say it's too different to rate."
DevilMayCry,373sl0,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Sun May 24 20:13:06 2015 UTC,"I thought the joke was pretty obvious, but okay.  I don't really bash DmC for the ""herpa derpa character design/level design/story/dumbed-down combat system"".   Its the color-coded enemies/the fact that Vergil and Dante can't play through each other's levels.  Vergil's levels were a joke, considering he's overpowered and easier than Dante.  The Raven was ""okay"" while the Jailer was a replacement for the color-coded enemies. It sucked. Spam the angel melee special and you're done with it.  But yeah, a joke is a joke. I don't hate you over your opinions, that'd be stupid."

DevilMayCry,373sl0,ShiftyAxel,2,Sun May 24 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"HD Collection all the way. I played the 360 version and found no problems with it.  In terms of game order, 1 then 3.  2 was a mistake. If you really really really gotta know why everyone hates it, finish 1, then play up to the tank in mission 2 or so. You'll know.  And I highly recommend not playing 3 first. It's godlike, but it evolved the formula and implementation so much that it'll make 1 feel clunky and less fun in comparison if you haven't been through it before."
DevilMayCry,373sl0,Arakha,2,Mon May 25 11:16:43 2015 UTC,"2 was a mistake. If you really really really gotta know why everyone hates it, finish 1, then play up to the tank in mission 2 or so. You'll know.   I find it funny because that's pretty much exactly what I did 3 days ago. Before playing the HD collection I had already played a lot of DMC4 and DmC. I finished DMC1 and liked it a lot. I then began playing DMC2, and while there are some improvements, the atmosphere and the enemies are completely awful. I stopped at mission 5 or 6, I think... After beating the chopper boss. How did they think that corrupted tanks and helicopters would be fun to fight against ?  And then I finished DMC3, and loved it."
DevilMayCry,373sl0,ShiftyAxel,1 point,Thu May 28 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"I think experiencing the 'why am I fighting a fucking tank?' moment is a rite of passage for every DMC2 player.  I remember buying 1 & 2 as a teenager, finishing the first and getting so hype for the awesome new devil arms and moves that I expected to be in the sequel. Instead we got lame DT gems, military-themed enemies and 5 minute gunfights with airborne bosses :|  What's even more mind boggling is that you can unlock Trish in 2, and she has the original DMC1 moveset. Complete with way better animations and loads of great tech that they somehow forgot to include in Dante and Lucia's arsenal."

DevilMayCry,373sl0,bassomegax,0,Tue May 26 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"People here are not answering the OP's question, which is not ""what order to play DMC1, 2, 3"", but rather ""PS2 or HD Collection"".  Most people choose the HD collection due to the 720p resolution. That is pretty much most of what the HD versions have going for it. I will now explain more of the differences(though not exhaustive) of each version in detail.   DMC1 IMO, the best version is the PS2 version. Yes, the HD Collection runs at 1280x720, but the HD Collection also brings a fair share of its own issues. I consider the PS2 version superior to the HD Collection in almost every single way except for resolution. Now I will talk about version differences of PS2, PS3, 360.   I will assume that you have the USA version of PS2 DMC1. This is actually a harder version than the HD version as DMC1 HD was based on the Japanese version of DMC1. When DMC1 was brought to USA, it was made harder(your attacks do less damage, enemies do more damage), and so people who have played DMC1 on PS2 who then moved to the HD version noticed that it was easier. On the hardest difficulty though, it's pretty much the same between all versions.   One big difference between PS2 JPN and PS2 USA is the control scheme. The Japanese version of DMC1 has X for jump, Square and Circle as firearms, and Triangle for melee attacks. The USA version moved this around, so Triangle is jump, Square and X are firearms, and Circle is melee attacks. As the HD version is based on the Japanese version, the HD version uses the Japanese control scheme. Tthe issue with this is when you move on to other games in the series, and your muscle memory messes you up. Fortunately, DMC3 has customizable controls. DMC2 does not.  PS3, IMO, looks the nicest, but also has the most amount of graphical glitches. Of course, you might not notice these graphical glitches unless you have played DMC1 on PS2, so there's that. The 360 version looks different from the PS3 version. It usually does not have the same graphical glitches that the PS3 version has, but it has its own graphical glitches, but fewer in number.   Finally, the PS3 version, I've found, stutters here and there. It annoys me personally, but I'm not sure if it would bother you. I haven't experienced this in the 360 version.  I've also noticed that there is a BGM looping issue in the HD version of DMC1, which is most noticeable at the end of the game.   In summary, HD versions have their own glitches, mostly graphical. 360 has less glitches than PS3. HD version is easier than PS2.  DMC2 From my limited playing of DMC2, all versions are pretty much the same. You can go with any version.  DMC3 Now first of all, there are 2 PS2 versions, the regular release, and the Special Edition. As I assume you have the USA version, I would recommend the Special Edition. The Special Edition includes an additional playable character, as well as more options to make the game easier or difficult. In fact, with the PS2 Special Edition, if you really wanted to, you can play it as hard as the original PS2 USA release.   Now, I've haven't played much of DMC3 HD, but I've noticed that DMC3 PS3 also stutters, like in DMC1. My limited playing of the 360 version did not experience this.   Another difference is that there is an unlock everything code in DMC3. When you use this code on the HD version, it disables saving. Now personally, I would use this code to avoid the tedious task of playing the game several times to unlock everything, though that's also because I've done this before. Another thing I would use this for is for better playthroughs. I recommend playing the ""Very Hard"" difficulty after beating Normal mode, as the differences between Normal and Hard mode are not that significant.   Note about playing on 360 One thing about the DMC games is that they were designed for PS2. One of the main functions in the games is locking on. This button is mapped to R1 in all games. For the HD version, this button is mapped to RB on the 360 controller. You have the ability to change this button only in DMC3. So also consider if you are comfortable with holding down RB. (I use a PS2 to 360 adapter when I play the 360 HD Collection)."

DevilMayCry,36yrsb,TBAAAGamer1,5,Sun May 24 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen so far, it seems like speed only comes out quickly when you're not in combat."
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,KallyWally,1 point,Sat May 23 06:58:13 2015 UTC,"It may be due to the fact that most players use lock-on the majority of the time during battle, locking them into a walking state while they aren't performing any moves. Maybe, if we're lucky, Gregaman will show it with Nero. Perhaps I should make sure I'm on stream to ask."
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,terrSC,2,Sat May 23 07:11:09 2015 UTC,"Ah really? Most people lock on? Why? Actually curious, not trolling. Even with my difficulties in my hands, i find locking on limits what you can do."
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,NimbleBrain,5,Sat May 23 14:05:21 2015 UTC,Locking on is required to access your directional moves. It's not exactly a perfect method but it's been a genre standard for a while. You should probably get over the initial awkwardness if you want to access the full move list.
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,terrSC,2,Sat May 23 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"I briefly will lock on for certain moves, but I don't keep it locked on. I was assuming  you meant people always kept it locked on. Sorry"
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,NimbleBrain,2,Sat May 23 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"Oh, you're asking why people keep holding the lock? Probably because tapping lock doesn't guaruntee a lock on the enemy you might want to hit whereas holding it keeps the lock saved on your deskred target."
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,terrSC,2,Sat May 23 19:58:23 2015 UTC,"Even though someone else already answered this, I wouldn't say that holding R1 throughout most of the battle is necessary or preferable. It just seems that most players online (including the people streaming Special Edition) tend to have lock-on active more often than not.  Aside from the directional inputs NimbleBrain mentioned, it also seems that Vergil won't lose concentration while walking in lock-on (probably because he's not running), so holding lock-on will make it easier to keep Vergil at his peak efficiency, at the very least."
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,kampasta,2,Sat May 23 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"Vergil's my favourite character in the series, so being locked on all the time will be interesting. Thanks for all the answers."
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,Illidan1943,2,Sat May 23 21:00:06 2015 UTC,"In the first few gameplay videos that came out, vergil runs around on several occasions to show off the concentration drain and never enters sprint. Pretty sure out of combat sprint just happens way faster"
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,Warsc2k,2,Sat May 23 17:47:48 2015 UTC,"No, I found very clear that even if they aren't locked in speed takes longer in combat"

DevilMayCry,36yrsb,Warsc2k,1 point,Sat May 23 22:54:08 2015 UTC,"Speaking of asking, could you ask if the PC version of DMC4SE is going to...  ...you know...  have proper controls? Like, keyboard and mouse and not just keyboard?  I would ask, but timezones are a bitch."
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,Bloodhit,1 point,Tue May 26 20:54:42 2015 UTC,"My guess is that he'll only answer that question if he can check on stream, so if he isn't using the PC version I doubt he'll be able to confirm anything.  I think it would be safe to assume it will be like the original control setup for DMC 4 on PC (which is probably exactly what Greg would say if he can't check on stream). Either way, I'll try. :)"

DevilMayCry,36yrsb,NimbleBrain,1 point,Sat May 23 07:20:45 2015 UTC,"I've heard the theory that all the gameplay demos have been using the super costumes so far, so unless they've confirmed it on-stream we may still have to deal with the old sprint behaviour.  If it comes out that quick for normal costumes however, hell yeah. Rainbow is super fun."
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,KallyWally,1 point,Sat May 23 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to work Rainbow into combo finishers and boss fights. DT is essential for it to be a viable. I think it has ducking properties, but even though he's in the air, it can't be Jump canceled. Unfortunately, I don't think the changes to sprinting affect combat situations, so I doubt it's going to be any more viable."
DevilMayCry,36yrsb,Genei_no_Miria,1 point,Sat May 23 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"Greg just confirmed on stream that Speed comes out at the original (slow) speed during combat. :\  He did say it 'may just be this build', but I'm guessing it's final. sigh"
DevilMayCry,36x790,ColdVergil,9,Fri May 22 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"How did you guys not notice this from the trailer? You clearly see Sparda Dante in a cutscene of the original game. Plus, everyone knows the models used ingame are the same for cutscenes, which is why costume mods always worked in cutscenes as well."
DevilMayCry,36x790,DeathDevilize,3,Fri May 22 22:25:00 2015 UTC,"About mods: Actually, not. They have different folders, DEMO for HiQuallity models for cutscenes, and Game for lowpoly one, which contains the game models themselves, yeah, they use the same names, but folders are different, which is why if you'll copy a model from Game to DEMO, and do cutscene invalidation this will work.However, Texture mods work indeed, since they use same folder and same names as well.  And people noticed that, as well as weird colorswaps, well, except the OP, i guess."

DevilMayCry,36x790,scionicspectre,1 point,Sat May 23 01:32:37 2015 UTC,"Gregaman confirmed in this stream and the Lady stream that there is only one costume per character (aside from the default outfits, obviously). There are also recolors, some of which they've shown, others which they haven't. My guess is 2 recolors each.  To reiterate, we do have confirmation that we've seen all of the non-palette-swap costumes."
DevilMayCry,36x790,Genei_no_Miria,0,Sat May 23 02:46:02 2015 UTC,"he is wrong a semi decent amount of times . . .   for example, he said that lady and trish has no super character mode . . . for over a month running every single japanese stream featured them with infinite devil trigger, so yeah XD I wouldn't hold my breath for 10 costumes for everyone tho, but it is better to take all his statements with a grain of salt"

DevilMayCry,36egdn,scionicspectre,4,Tue May 19 13:46:50 2015 UTC,"I can tell you that in my experience that the main thing that makes beating Hell and Hell hard is the Chimera Assaults in the second half... I mean lots of other things are difficult when you die in one hit but but the Chimera attacks are so random sometimes that you just get caught.  Other than that, learning a lot of the boss patterns in DMC4 is pretty simple compared to some of the other bosses in the series."
DevilMayCry,36egdn,ThnderDwnUndr,3,Tue May 19 14:32:42 2015 UTC,"Except for Dante, I'd say. Sure, there's some AI loop you can use to cheese him, but if you want a real battle, this is the only really difficult part of Hell and Hell. You get 3 hits before death, after all, so I'd honestly say the S rank for all DMD missions would be much harder than this one.  Luckily, there are some decent guides on the exact requirements to S rank each mission, so having some idea of that will certainly make things more approachable. Apparently, taking no damage multiplies your overall score by 1.5, so sticking to that alone should help dramatically. Like most people, the no damage Dante battle in Bloody Palace is the one I'm honestly unsure I can deliver, even with a Super costume."
DevilMayCry,36egdn,Illidan1943,3,Tue May 19 15:06:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely agree with you 100% on that one. Dante is the reason I said ""a lot of the boss patterns"" instead of ""all of them"".  While I know it'll be a bitch, I'm pretty sure I can eventually no damage Dante, the only thing I'm worried about is how many times I'm going to have to practice the fight until I can do it.  And as for using super costumes, I don't know about you but for me I have a lot of trouble no damaging bosses with super costumes. I mean it's easy kills, but with the no knock back that the super costumes gives you for a lot of attacks I have a lot of trouble learning how to avoid things properly. Is it just me?"
DevilMayCry,36egdn,scionicspectre,3,Tue May 19 16:15:07 2015 UTC,"No, not just you. I played a BP run with Super Dante last night just for fun, then I did it regular again today and I was shocked at how much stun damage I was taking from tiny hits. I'll definitely have to prioritize evasive maneuvers for this trophy, and even then there's that sudden shotgun blast.

DevilMayCry,36c5yo,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Mon May 18 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"That's because it seems that when you sheathe and have summoned swords on an enemy, they explode. I heard it in one of the streams but the guy didn't try it."
DevilMayCry,36c5yo,TheMightyMrPlow,1 point,Tue May 19 02:13:32 2015 UTC,"funny story about that- In dmc3 when vergil was allowed to fully sheathe his weapon, you'd be rewarded with a style boost. this carried over to dante in dmc4, where performing the full sheathing animation would give a rank boost.  in DmC however, the devs decided to get brain dead about it, vergil got the most sheathing animations and some of the coolest ones, but literally NO style boost or benefit. it was the closest thing to a taunt we got though. so, to counter this and try to make DmC vergil look extremely cool, we started doing stuff like...this: https://youtu.be/OPnv-sflS08?t=171 Basically we'd hit red sword teleport just as the sheathing animation would finish, and this typically looked badass, and could even stop an enemy mid-combo, giving an advantage. on rare occasions the sword would just explode instead of teleport when the enemy was on low health, doing a bit of damage and killing enemies that were at 1hp.   it was our way of compensating for the lack of the staple ""stylish sheath"" which a lot of us sorely missed. I guess the developers who programmed vergil's combat must have either noticed this habit or been doing it themselves, it's actually a nice nod."

DevilMayCry,367ymr,P3RR01,1 point,Tue May 19 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"Devil May Cry (from Bayonetta wikia):       Devil May Cry is a series of games published and developed by Capcom, which follow the exploits of the half-demon protagonist, Dante, as he battles against the forces of hell. The first in the series was created by ""Team Little Devils,"" and was directed by Hideki Kamiya. The original series had four games (Devil May Cry 1, 2, 3, *and 4), the first three were exclusive to PlayStation 2 (although the third did receive a PC port later on), and the fourth was a multiplatform title for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows. The series underwent a reboot in 2013 developed by Ninja Theory, titled ""DmC: Devil May Cry*"". Despite the reboot, the original versions of the characters still appear in many Capcom crossover games, due to the reboot being developed by a Western company and gaining poor reception.

DevilMayCry,366n40,kampasta,6,Sat May 16 21:58:01 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, those boards. I hadn't been before so I just checked it out, petty much every page is like 4 people arguing about something stupid until mods lock the thread, and everyone seems to get pretty nasty in general. Even one of the mods is acting like a flat out asshole, is this normal for those boards or did something get stirred up because of the special editions? :(  It really bums me out to see that. The DMC fan base had traditionally been on the smaller side, and seeing and entire site acting that way makes me hope nobody else finds those boards and thinks we're all like them...  Sorry for the sudden rant, seeing all that was not expected, yeah costumes though. I'm pretty happy with classic lady, Gloria, and secretary trish. Could be neat if there were order of the sword uniforms as costumes for all the characters and not just trish"
DevilMayCry,366n40,PM_ME_STAB_WOUNDS,3,Sat May 16 18:21:58 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's not a bad idea. I'm totally up for fanart adaptations and stuff making a showing in this poll since there are plenty of good ideas we haven't seen from Capcom itself.  And yes, I often question what I'm doing at those forums, but the smack-talking usually comes from the fact that DmC and DMC fans are encouraged to come together there which can cause undue conflict. I happen to be a big fan of both, and I try to encourage sensibility there but sometimes I fall into the trap of getting into the argument that kills a thread. It's a real shame and I have very mixed feelings about being there, but I don't know a lot of other places to talk to the fandom.  The problem is that people got really defensive when DmC came out since they felt like DMC was dead, and now DmC fans are getting antsy because they feel like DMC 4: SE is threatening the existence of DmC. This demonstrates a fairly naive and uninformed view of the situation, and in general it would seem the forum is filled with angst-driven clods, but that's only because they get the spotlight amidst the more reasonable fans.  The person who speaks too loudly often has much less to say."
DevilMayCry,366n40,goddamn_owl,3,Sat May 16 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"imo both games are pretty good. Obviously I've got a big preference for the classic series, but the reboot is pretty damn good too, and I don't really think it's fair that it gets shit on so often just because it doesn't measure up against the original series in all the same ways, especially when it isn't even targeting some of the things the original series did.  If they're making special editions for both games, at the same time, for the same systems, I really don't see how that should make anyone worry that their series is being forgotten about, it's like they're just going out of their way to be offended so they can argue more.  Still, those are the fans, there should be no excuse for what I'm seeing the mods doing. I did a heavy amount of moderating back in my day (I'll just say that it was at some notoriously shitty sites, and we had our work cut out for us to keep things in line) and these mods are doing absolutely everything wrong. Jesus, not even 3 pages in and I'm seeing a mod who wandered into an argument after it had resolved itself, acted like a smug arrogant dick to provoke another fight, and then locked the thread after the most self important speech about respecting his authority that I've ever seen. In another instance I saw that guy lock a thread where nothing was even going wrong, but according to yet another dick stroking wall of text, he explains he just knows for a fact that certain posters will kill the thread, so he just shuts it down right in the middle. Just because he doesn't like people. I've never seen mods go so far out of their way to make bad situations worse, and it really explains the overwhelmingly toxic attitude I saw there, not even 20 minutes into browsing the site.  Back on topic! Sorry again for the rant, I'm really just blown away by how incredibly terrible a fanbase for my favorite series ever can be. Your comment on fan art reminded me though! This is one of my favorite fan costumes ever, and when bayonetta 2 was coming out I hoped and prayed that a crossover nod like this would be one of the unlockable costumes, but alas it was not. If Trish had a costume based on that fan art, I think I could die happy"
DevilMayCry,366n40,krynnmeridia,2,Sat May 16 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'd be the best mod, but I think I'd definitely be a decent mod if they gave me a chance. I mean, the mindset you have when you're a member trying to solve problems is completely different from how a mod is supposed to behave. You're there to enforce the rules and resolve conflicts in a calm and unbiased way. I guess my biggest issue is that I don't feel very good about the userbase there in general, but that may be a strength as I wouldn't have a strong preference.  Also back on topic, That's kinda' neat. Since I'm not Capcom I can definitely make whatever the community feels like, so that would be more than acceptable. I think the only issue with what you posted would be alpha-sorting on the hair, but I'm sure that would be easy enough to resolve. Also, since Trish doesn't have a coat, there's a chance there would be no bones to rig a coat to, meaning it would have to either move with the legs or float rigidly. Since Eva's Gloria costume has the tailcoat thing, though, I'm guessing it's doable to an extent."
DevilMayCry,366n40,KirillianAmurawr,1 point,Sat May 16 19:15:50 2015 UTC,If the coat was pulled in at the waist (which is a more feminine fit) the remaining length could probably be painted to Gloria's tails and it would look pretty good

DevilMayCry,366n40,Davidzeero,3,Sun May 17 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"yes. Seriously, that guy is so arrogant I almost registered an account just to fight him. I mean, not all the mods seemed bad, when most of them stepped in to a thread, they were usually reminding people to respect the rules. LordOfDarkness seems to love reminding people to respect his power.  Oh but... he really does have this way, of abusing punctionation.... making it seem like he's taking thoughtful, important pauses... it's so dramatic.  I am frankly appalled that this asshole is actually representing our community as a community moderator. I did my time in some shitty boards, even including 4chan for many years, and frankly I've never had someone shitpost so cancerously, and piss me off so much, with only like 4 posts. More people are going to be checking the community out as the special edition, and I can think of nothing worse than that guy being the first figure of supposed authority within the DMC community. Fucker."

DevilMayCry,366n40,Davidzeero,6,Sun May 17 07:37:24 2015 UTC,"Don't know, I was thinking of every single costume featured in the games (that of course is not a recolor or a coatless): All of DMC1, all of DMC2 and all of DMC3 plus the Graphic Edition costume for Vergil (since Dante's is almost like its final design for DMC1). As suggestions for completely new costumes:   For Dante: Just thinking about the possibility: what if Dante got corrupted?... and using the Majin Form from DMC2 with it, adding an actual DmC:DMC costume sounds nice too, Modeus costume (DMC anime), maybe a high-class suit. For Vergil: ...And if Vergil became all-powerful?, DmC:DMC costume but with hair up and changing SFX to a deep blue, Baul costume (DMC anime), an actual Nelo Angelo if its not added, maybe Henry Cooldown of No More Heroes but using DMC3 hair down and changing the blue hue of his SFX for a purple one, the DT for the last one could be similar to Doppelganger from DMC3. For Nero: What if Nero was raised by Vergil?, a costume based on another of his concepts but with DT being him turned into the ghost that normally appears with Yamato if its not added already, maybe Travis Touchdown from No More Heroes as well, DT could be Dark Side Mode with a fiery red aura. A high-class suit as well. For Trish: To clarify: she gets Lucia's costumes. As new costumes: What if she had a Devil Form? the DT would resemble an Electric Siren (with legs of course) of sorts but leaning towards a more demonic appearance than Dante/Vergil, a Nevan one perhaps with SFX turned electric purple, a Bayonetta one with Eva would be nice as a nod to the little sis of the franchise, a high-class suit/dress. For Lady: What if she followed her father's steps?, she could get a DmC:DMC one of Kat but slightly modified, a high-class suit/dress.   Dunno, got a thing for regal suits and also was on a NMH mood lately. Also got the head a bit hollow here :T"
DevilMayCry,366n40,Davidzeero,3,Sat May 16 23:45:20 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of post I'm talking about! A lot of good stuff that I could actually make from scratch.

I love the HUD which shows the 'ammo' and charge shot levels. All of the different charge shots looks really cool too. The pistols seem kind of weak compared to the shotgun and kalina ann, but maybe they're best for chaining attacks together for combos. (Surprised there's no Uzi like in DMC3) Her devil trigger replacement is a bit disappointing. I wish you could do more than just one super move with the 'bailout' button and that it built up faster. Seems like she's pretty screwed if enemies get close. Would be cool if she had a 'counter' move that could be timed like a just/royal block. Or maybe they should just give her Nero's dodge since she's replacing him.   Lady seems really fun and different. Always liked Gunslinger style so I can't wait to try her out."
DevilMayCry,363o26,AzuresX19,8,Fri May 15 20:59:22 2015 UTC,You can use Air-Raid if you have the Nevan weapon equipped just like DMC1's Alistor. I believe Air Raid is part of Nevan's move list. So if you haven't gotten that far then you obviously won't see it in the shop.

DevilMayCry,3625of,ColdVergil,2,Fri May 15 18:34:13 2015 UTC,"Welp I already posted my opinion on some other post but I'll do it anyway again.  Capcom wanted to go west or american style and that's why they let Ninja Theory do DmC. If it sells well, gets a sequel. But DmC didn't sell so well( 1.5 millions in comparison with DMC 4: 2.9 millions) so that's why they gave it a last chance with DmC Definitive Edition. What did they add? ALL THE STUFF THAT MADE OLDER DMC GAMES SUPERIOR. Just to start - Manual Lock on-   It makes me real mad that they firstly stated that DmC was way better and different from the others, it was ''superior''. So now they go and add all the old DMC stuff that made it so good, why? Because it was not selling, plus it was getting criticized like hell, Capcom realizes this and they say to Ninja Theory, add all the stuff ergo DmC Definitive Edition.  Now I can't find any info if DmC DE is selling a lot but Capcom starts listening to people and people want to know hey where is Nero from, it's been so many years. Capcom comes up with this: Let's give them a little teaser to see how much feedback we can get. They release that little teaser those 12 seconds that were better than the 2 min video of DmC DE. Vergil's back.   The feedback is HUGEEEEEEEEEE, DmC got boycotted like hell, so Capcom just gives green light on the Special Edition and now they want to see how well it sells.  If it sells amazingly well, we can probably expect a DMC 5, which has been a top topic on Neogaf.  Well, that is what I think of, this is mostly based on my opinion plus some research. I'm also studying advertising and makerting in college(not that i'm really good tho ;-;), and Capcom have really started to hear on us, 'cause you know in the past... XD  SO I SAY, PEOPLE! BUY THE HELL OUT OF DMC 4 SPECIAL EDITION, LETS GIVE THEM A REASON TO BRING DMC 5! (Tho I can't buy games BUT I'M HERE! SUPPORTING!)"
DevilMayCry,3625of,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Fri May 15 18:58:35 2015 UTC,"well, upvote this thread, capcom's marketing of devil may cry deserves a bit of discussion to be quite honest. I agree, lots of people liked dmc4's new vergil way more than DmC. I loved the spinoff, but if I had to choose between vergil's downfall and dmc4 vergil's halfassed campaign? I'd choose dmc4 vergil's halfassed campaign, fully playable and taking cues from his super broken counterpart? WIN MY FRIEND!"

DevilMayCry,3625of,Rerunhomerun,4,Fri May 15 17:44:04 2015 UTC,"This theories need to stop... DmC is not going to take over the original series and DMC is not going to erase DmC existence as a franchise... BOTH will coexist.. DmC is basically a spin off series.. This was confirmed by GregaMan in one of the weekly streams of DmC DE before launch. He said something like this: ""Just because one of them exist, doesn't mean we are ignoring the other one. Both of them will exist""   Now, DmC won't have a sequel anytime soon because NT is working on hellblade. DMC 5 is most likely already on the works, and the reception of DMC4 SE will just change how soon it will be released...  Can't we just enjoy both?..."
DevilMayCry,3625of,kampasta,2,Fri May 15 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. DmC is a nice compliment to devil may cry because it has a vastly different setting and premise, it's practically the first game where you see dante interacting with PEOPLE instead of, i dunno, demons or antiheroes, or cultists >.>  granted, it's not the same dante, but seeing him actually in society and culture was always something curiously absent in the classic devil may cry titles, he it was always offscreen or unimportant. and you got the sense that dante was a loner by nature and that he hunted demons in what were likely very closed off events that didn't really influence the world. dante was, for better or worse, a background hero who had all the flash and flamboyance of superman as well as ten times the personality. in DmC they at least expand upon WHY this is the case with new dante, they show him interacting with people in a cursory sense because he's always in danger of being dragged into limbo. he distances himself from people because it's never safe to be around him, and he goes to extremes to keep them at arm's length because he knows he'll drag them into what he considers to be ""His battles"" or ""his fights"" hell, that was interesting. it was basically what I had originally hoped dmc2 would be in terms of plot, showing what a cool badass like dante would be like in a city setting, and while it wasn't quite as good as the classics, it's certainly better than 2.  tl;Dr Both dantes are good for different crowds and different reasons, and both games are good for different crowds and different reasons. DmC for detailing why dante is an anti-social jerk and demon slayer by implication and setting, and the classics because they forgo this for the sake of being fun as hell explosions of narrative free awesomeness."
DevilMayCry,3625of,TBAAAGamer1,2,Fri May 15 21:53:46 2015 UTC,I don't think they're in competition anymore. DmC sold like trash compared to previous installments. I they were just trying to milk as much cash as possible out of it. DMC5 is going to be the next game.
DevilMayCry,3625of,Genei_no_Miria,2,Sat May 16 16:05:59 2015 UTC,"Why not both? The games may have similar mechanics (to a shallow degree) but the tone and setting are so wildly different, it would be like suggesting the Halo series ends because Half-life is also a shooter"

DevilMayCry,35yhfk,FarAsYouCanThrowMe,1 point,Thu May 14 22:48:37 2015 UTC,"It feels much better in the hand. That is, less pointed angles and more of a firm fit, so it's easier to play longer without fatigue or minor aching. You don't really need to consciously hold it, unlike the DS3 (comparitively).  Also, the analog sticks are far more precise and smooth to move, even near the center, and the triggers in the back are a massive improvement. Aside from that, the face buttons are a bit shallower so there's less effort involved with every button press, and they 'click' in more than mushing in like the DS3.  Overall, it takes everything I liked about the previous design and makes it better. I'll never go back unless I'm forced to (Devil May Cry HD Collection)."

DevilMayCry,35ykq4,kampasta,2,Thu May 14 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"try making an account right now. Go here and make an account.  When you install steam, you'll be prompted for some user info, but the stuff like your display name and avatar can be changed at any time and multiple users can have the same one, so no pressure on picking.  The main steam window has several tabs at the top, for accessing your games, checking your profile, and the store.  You only have to be online to update your games, play multiplayer games that use steam to matchmake, and buy games.  Once you've done that, you can click the steam tag and hit ""go offline"" and you're done.  Being online does have some handy benefits though -- every game, even non steam games, synch with the steam cloud.  You could totally uninstall steam and every game, burn your computer, get a new rig, and when you download your games you'd have every save file and setting ready to go, just how you left it.  It's extremely convenient when I upgrade or do reinstalls to just install steam, click download down the list of my games, and just let it do its thing.  Seriously, having one thing that just takes care of installing like 100+ games all in one shot is amazing for the times you need it  If you don't want to use the steam interface to access games (which is not really worth it if you only have one steam game) you can make shortcuts that launch your steam games directly.  TL;DR - using steam is kind of like cooking for yourself.  If it's your very first time and you need to download an entire kitchen before you can make a sandwich, it's a bit of a headache to get started, but once you've got it up and running, it's actually quite nice."

DMC3SE changes those difficulties around: Easy became even easier, Normal became what Easy used to be, Hard became what Normal used to be, Very Hard was introduced to be the new Hard, and Dante Must Die was left unchanged.  Basically, if you want to experience the original difficulty, start on Hard."

For some strange reason, Capcom USA decided the original version of the game was too easy, so they bumped each difficulty (except for DMD) up a notch, making American Easy and Normal the Japanese Normal and Hard, respectively. In the special edition, the returning difficulties are as they were in the Japanese original, while US!Hard got turned into Very Hard."

DevilMayCry,35xyj5,swordmalice,2,Thu May 14 13:26:54 2015 UTC,"I think the SE remixes some of the enemies you fight on the harder difficulties. Don't quote me though because I haven't played the original since I beat it on DMD mode back in '05/'06. As a result, the SE seems a tad harder. I remember having a royal pain in the ass beating it on Very Hard mode. So much so that I'm scared to even try DMD."
DevilMayCry,35xyj5,kampasta,2,Thu May 14 14:53:02 2015 UTC,"They really nerfed the 1st vergil fight on normal tho that's for sure, the thing that made think that SE was a bit harder was the fact that enemies did more damage and were a bit more quick to act."
DevilMayCry,35xyj5,AzuresX19,1 point,Thu May 14 15:29:42 2015 UTC,"every difficulty was shifted down by one in the special edition.  Normal in SE is easy in standard, however, the special edition now has a ""very easy"" mode, and one extra difficulty before dante must die, which is unchanged.  I highly recommend the special edition -- not only do you get to play as vergil, but you also don't have to put up with a lot of bullshit, like the standard edition's death system.  If you die in standard (or select ""yellow"" when it asks you yellow or gold) you start the entire level over, and using a gold orb respawns you at the last checkpoint, not where you died.  In the special edition, orbs respawn you on the spot, while dying sends you to the checkpoint.  Words cannot describe how insane trying to beat a new boss was when playing for the very first time, on hard, having to replay the entire level after every failed boss attempt.  Don't do it"

DevilMayCry,35tcs7,excelsis27,1 point,Wed May 13 22:02:55 2015 UTC,"That's mostly because all the cutscenes in FF13 are video files. So if you download both English and Japanese voice overs, you get double the amount of videos. DMC4 on the other hand uses realtime cutscenes, so it would only need to download audio the files, which are much smaller than videos. The reason why the Special Edition is so much bigger is likely because of uncompressed/higher resolution textures and higher quality audio."

DevilMayCry,35siz4,ShiftyAxel,1 point,Wed May 13 11:30:33 2015 UTC,"My guess would be a combination of improved assets and more cutscenes.  Anything  video or audio is bad in that respect since it has to be available in multiple languages, which can ratchet up the file size real quick."

Other than LDK mode... everything else should work on PS3 with this game. I fear they might've goofed up the game's amazing performance by making it for current generation consoles and not caring to keep it toaster-friendly.   Also, check out the minimum system requirements. The original release required only 512 MB of ram. This new version requires 2GB (3 times as much) as well as higher spec everything else, too. The hell are they doing? What could need 3 times as much ram in this game? What graphics could be so higher that putting the game on minimum would still require better hardware?  And I'm not using a toaster I have a beast of a PC. I just like it when things are made for toasters because they perform like fucking magic. Dat 120fps DMC4:SE is out of this world."
DevilMayCry,35siz4,FarAsYouCanThrowMe,1 point,Wed May 13 09:24:13 2015 UTC,The install size appears to have gone from 8GB to 27GB. It makes sense - my guess is they're simply shipping with uncompressed textures/audio to take advantage of more memory and storage on modern systems. I fully expect it to still run perfectly and at high frame rates.

DevilMayCry,35on1h,UnmannedSurveillance,4,Tue May 12 12:06:29 2015 UTC,Super    where's your motivation?
DevilMayCry,35on1h,kampasta,1 point,Wed May 13 06:06:21 2015 UTC,Gone if I made it past 100 boring Bloody Palace levels only to get hit by Dante's shotgun (which is unseeable and undodgeable btw). I'll just DT buster him till it's over.
DevilMayCry,35on1h,UnmannedSurveillance,1 point,Wed May 13 09:16:56 2015 UTC,"nah, it might be one of the trickier moves, but it's definitely visible and very much dodgable.  Pretty much if you ever see dante do a short hop into the air, immediately roll.  He'll only ever try to helmbreaker you in certain situations (mainly as a counter to one of your moves) so if you're just outside of his melee range and he suddenly hops up, he's going to shotgun you.  There are a few moves he will counter by attempting to shotgun, but I don't remember them off the top of my head.  However it's worth noting that for shotgun counters you are actually worse off if you are in permanent DT than if you're just normal!  If you're mid attack and dante leaps to shotgun, the only move that can avoid that damage is the invulnerability frames of your initial devil trigger transformation, which has one of the biggest invulnerability windows in the game.  However, this window is only for when you go from normal to devil triggered, not the other way around.  If you go to attack while in devil trigger and he shotgun counters, you're fucked.  An even easier solution is to constantly bait him into situations where he tries to counter with punishable counters.  If you simply walk back and forth toward him, he'll try to hit you with his sword, which opens him up for a grab and a few hits.  With careful baiting, dante will never attempt to shotgun you because you'll be locking him into a cycle of poorly attempting to counter you, and you punishing him for it.  But if getting shotgunned is a problem for you, a super skin will actually makes this problem worse by taking away your best damage avoidance.  Don't do it."
DevilMayCry,35on1h,kampasta,0,Wed May 13 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"I think the intended point here is that a Super character makes it much easier to get to Stage 101, and then if you just abuse the Snatch/combo loop Dante will die that much faster from the added DT damage.  Super Nero genuinely is the fastest and safest way to get this achievement unless they've patched the loop."

DevilMayCry,35on1h,UnmannedSurveillance,1 point,Fri May 15 08:04:13 2015 UTC,"It's what they're primarily used for to track player behaviour, progress an other general information. It's pretty obvious from just looking at them. Milestones for numbers of enemies killed, how far in the main storyline you completed, the time it took you between each chapter/mission based on achievement earning. 90% of them in any game can barely even be called 'achievements' that require skill or focus... more so just grind... some are even awarded just for turning the game on. The time-stamp on that alone is a big piece of information.  I think it was Obsidian who once reported findings on this. Apparently the PC version of Fallout New Vegas, a large percent of players never got the first achievement which was just basically getting past the character creation and intro area. This was very strange as they definitely started the game but must've closed it immediately and never went back. This wasn't a small percent I think it was 15% of users or something like that. A curious case indeed. Google brings no articles unfortunately but I definitely remember reading about it.  I think some speculate it was users who just booted to make sure it worked before they started modding and skipped the main game's intro area there or removed the DRM."

DevilMayCry,35ehka,ThnderDwnUndr,6,Sat May 9 15:44:07 2015 UTC,You know I've always had the same idea and it sounds like a fun concept but to put the whole game around co-op would be difficult to make while keeping the same or similar system it could probably work as a bonus mode and maybe worked on from there
DevilMayCry,35ehka,jokerdan12,1 point,Sat May 9 15:56:49 2015 UTC,I was thinking just make the game as usual and have a co op option for bloody palace would be the best way to do it... That way they wouldn't be interfering with the single player and people who would like to co op have an awesome alternative.  And as a bonus maybe they could have like a co op boss rush mode.
DevilMayCry,35ehka,KirillianAmurawr,3,Sat May 9 16:32:45 2015 UTC,I'd rather have 2 heroes playable at the same time on one level.
DevilMayCry,35ehka,scionicspectre,3,Sun May 10 03:46:36 2015 UTC,"I think it would be awesome since we could pick up each others combos in LDK. Like, who wouldn't love that? Even if it was just an afterthought, it would be awesome (just like DoppleGanger and 2P Vergil was).  So yeah, it would be fun, but it needs to be optional like that. If it were built into the game like it is in Kirby, it would suck to have the AI pick off demons for you just because you didn't have a friend around."
DevilMayCry,35ehka,scionicspectre,0,Sat May 9 17:25:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah no I don't think there is a single DMC fan that would want it built in like that... Even just the afterthought versions of co op in DMC3 were great, I only ever wanted to try it out without having to use the Super Sparda costume or the 2 minute boss fight with Vergil at your side.  Imagine actually getting to try out 2 different characters with different styles at the same time? Even if it's just in Bloody Palace that would be sick."
DevilMayCry,35ehka,UnmannedSurveillance,0,Sat May 9 17:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, free up the Circle button and it would be a lot more entertaining. I've been doing that in the PC version with the style-switcher mod and it's been pretty damn fun. I need to find out if 2P is even possible on PC, come to think of it."
DevilMayCry,35ehka,UnmannedSurveillance,3,Sat May 9 17:45:19 2015 UTC,I think it would be great as long as the base gameplay isn't changed. With a coop buddy that's good at the game I think 2 players could perform pretty cool dual combos. Dante in gunslinger w/ Lady would be pretty fun I'd imagine.
DevilMayCry,35ehka,terrSC,1 point,Sat May 9 21:40:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree... And as much as I love the idea of playing DMC with a friend, there's no way I'd want it if it took away from the normal DMC experience. That's why I made sure I let everyone know I was asking in the context of it theoretically not hindering the game in any way. Because I know nobody would ever actually want co op because almost everyone would be sure it would hurt the game."

Then there's walls of white text covering the actual action of the video, most of which is meaningless commentary or bragging about how awesome you are, which would already be annoying even if it wasn't blocking my view, but since I can't see shit around ""LE TROLLFACE"" now I'm just twice as annoyed.  When you're actually demonstrating your advice, the meat of your commentary is very sparse, basically amounting to ""do this"", but even this tiny amount of actual meaning falls prey to your verbal bulimia, and as always, words that say nothing are now blocking the view of the video I'm trying to watch.  Then when you actually give a more useful breakdown on how and why your strategy words, you pause the game, once again forcing us to try and read white text against the white text of the pause menu.  The how-to is so-so in usefulness and insight -- if someone literally could not beat a dreamwalker at all, you are relaying the bare minimum amount of knowledge necessary to actually take one down, but nothing more -- but the way you present this information is seriously godawful.

DevilMayCry,351hss,Musashi555,3,Wed May 6 09:24:41 2015 UTC,"I've platinum all three games in the Devil May Cry HD collection, so I'll tell you what I did to complete DMC2's Bloody Palace in the following steps:   Switch the difficulty to easy/normal (In campaign mode) before going to Bloody Palace. If you don't have the PAL version (I live in Canada, so I don't...) use Dante, since he's the more balanced of all three characters. Be careful when you're facing the mages (fire magic, ice magic, etc) don't use rocket launcher against them because there's a chance they can get stuck in the ground/walls and you have to start over again... Be super cautious whenever you encounter the goats, and I mean it! They are the most ridiculous and hardest enemies I've ever seen in this game. DMC3 has harder AIs, but at least you can figure out their behavioral patterns unlike those god damn goats... Everything else is pretty easy, boring, and repetitive; so it should take you 1-2+ hours to complete...   PS: I really wanted to play DMC3 so that motivated me to complete the piece of crap known as DMC2, so you should use that as your motivation as well.  Good luck and have fun (not really though...)!"
DevilMayCry,351hss,Diabel_Hanta,2,Wed May 6 12:54:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's DMC2 that's actually killing you. But if you really want to get the achievement then have you tried lowering the difficulty? If you completed the story on all difficulties like another guy here has, the BP will be on that difficulty."
DevilMayCry,351hss,Dethal,1 point,Wed May 6 09:46:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's a little bit of column A, and a little bit of column B, either way I completed MOST of the game. I haven't done Dante's Must Die mode yet cause I didn't need to after finishing Lucia's right? But it's Dante's file I'm playing cause he has all the items I need, which I had played on hard last time though the option to play it is there.   But how do you ""Lower"" the difficulty exactly? Will it stop enemies from DTing as well?   I think I had heard of something like that but when I checked GameFAQs no one seemed to know. Do I have to start a fresh new save file & recollect & re-upgrade?"
DevilMayCry,351hss,Dethal,1 point,Wed May 6 12:40:24 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhJybvUI6rs  I did some searching and found this, in the desc it says    Second, make sure you ONLY beat Normal Mode before doing this as bloody palace mode is difficulty related."
DevilMayCry,351hss,DarkDigiDragon,2,Wed May 6 12:48:10 2015 UTC,"It's just as /u/Dethal put it. DMC2 is the problem here. I had a similar problem before and learned the reason I kept getting my ass handed to me was because I was on the hardest difficulty without even knowing it. As far as I know, there is no way to lower the difficulty. It's insane how doing something intended- beating the game on all difficulties, can screw you over so badly. DMC2 was the last game I needed to 100% before moving on to DMC3, but it was really starting to mess with me. The community suggested I move on and I couldn't be happier. If you really want this, start the game over, only beat normal mode, and you should be good. I hope you get your trophy."
DevilMayCry,351hss,DarkDigiDragon,1 point,Wed May 6 14:27:40 2015 UTC,"Well oddly enough Dante's difficulty was on normal,  so I switched Lucia's difficulty & it seems to have made a difference. I actually made it to 2301 at a better pace, I think I could have gone farther if I didn't have to go somewhere in RL.  Though making a new file wouldn't be so bad I guess, I'd just have to recollect the items & etc on normal. But are you guys sure it'll work? Cause no one else I've spoken to has mentioned this but I'll give it a try. Since I've heard quite a few people here say it so it's worth a shot.  What all changes in Bloody Palace? Like I asked earlier do the enemies deal less damage, attack less frequently & can't activate Devil Trigger? That would be nice..."
DevilMayCry,351hss,DarkDigiDragon,1 point,Wed May 6 16:24:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's just not brought up often as not too many people are fans of DMC2, something like that I suppose. As for the changes, it's just difficulty and the amount of enemies on screen. After floor 1000 they gain the ability to DT. In my opinion it fails in comparison to DMC4's BP which forced me to learn new techniques and improve my skill in the game. It actually felt like a challenge, not a brutal cluster-fuck. Beating DMC4's BP gave me a sense of elation and pride in my skills. I can already tell beating DMC2's would not, which contributed to me quitting that game."

DevilMayCry,34u5uk,MegaDickCheny,4,Mon May 4 16:16:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've gotten pretty far already, so I don't expect it should be all that difficult to keep going. The first game is from 2001, so I think it's fair to say you should expect a pretty shitty camera system compared to what we're used to. I think it was pretty bad until DMC 3, honestly.  I'm guessing that what you're referring to is how you can't see yourself behind the masts due to the lack of camera control. All I can really suggest is to find a position you're most comfortable looking at the characters from and try to stay around there. Aside from that, it may be worth it to use some items during the fight just to get on with the next mission."
DevilMayCry,34u5uk,scionicspectre,3,Mon May 4 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"I've only played 3 and 4, but I know that DMC 1 was originally going to be Resident Evil 4. This should explain why so many of the camera angles seem to be from a fixed perspective. I don't know if this is what you're talking about, but directional inputs are performed in terms of the camera; the input for Stinger may read lock-on+forwards, but it's really lock-on+towards the enemy you're locked on to. If the camera shows that the enemy is to your left, Stinger would be lock-on+left, and High Time would be lock-on+right. Hope that helps."
DevilMayCry,34u5uk,Dreceratops,3,Mon May 4 19:37:01 2015 UTC,"To tell you the truth, there are seemingly a lot of new players seeing videos and hearing discussions about the games and it gets them into trying them, which is great no matter how you spin it.  But here is a bit of a problem... When you try games like this, knowing how people play them and all that, you set yourself up to not learn properly.  Like for example, a lot of the player here when discussing playing the game and their methods for doing so, it's always, ""which devil arms are good"", ""which styles are good"", ""which techniques are good"" and for the most part we will proceed to discuss combo strategies and ignore subjects like using guns as forms of damage or avoiding enemies instead of trying to combo. But that's exactly the kind of thing you should do if you're getting stuck.  I remember when DMC first came out when I was a kid and as much as I loved kicking ass with my big ass sword, sometimes an enemy will beat the ever loving shit out of you. That's when you get desperate, you don't care about looking cool or doing huge combos, you just want to get past this son of a bitch. So you find the safest way for you to damage the enemy without dying. Pick a gun you like run the fuck away and shoot the bastard until it stops moving.  If all goes well, you've done it! You're past the asshole that kept you stuck here and you find yourself with a way to play the game without dying, and before you know it you're getting past the rest of the levels. Now when you finish all the missions you can try the next difficulty, and you most likely won't be able to win the exact same way, but you know the enemies now and you can start adapting.  That's why there are multiple difficulties and that's why there is replayability. Don't be afraid to cheese your way past a tough spot, that's what I did when I started and now I can fully enjoy every aspect of the games without being held back and it's made for some incredible experiences.  Anyway... Sorry for the pointless rant, I'd just hate to see someone deterred from the series before they get to enjoy themselves. Either way, let me know how you go, and good luck."
DevilMayCry,34u5uk,ThnderDwnUndr,1 point,Tue May 5 05:11:19 2015 UTC,"Spamming the grenade launcher and making sure to dodge that one attack that launches you up is the best way to do it.

The first time I played, I needed to farm the first two levels for like 5 hours and just grind upgrades before I had enough power to try and gracelessly brute force the first boss.  The game is unforgiving and brutal; if you give it even a tiny opening, the game will rip off your nuts (or whatever, the game isn't sexist) and beat you to death with them while reminding you about your D ranking.  Beating the game is legitimately rewarding, because at no point does the game just hand you the win.  You'll have to earn it, but my god it feels good when you do!  For now though, I would just recommend trying to never use the same move twice in a row.  Yes, it matters.  Rolls and your first jump have frames of invulnerability, and are always good options.  Also for maximum killing power, try to only stinger or helm break an enemy if there is a wall directly behind them.  There are ways to cancel the knockback so you don't have to waste time running after them, but if you just started, you probably aren't there yet.  Good luck, and happy hunting!"

DevilMayCry,3445be,valdogg21,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:46:15 2015 UTC,"While DmC may or may not be good as an action game, it definitely fails as a Devil May Cry title and I feel you didn't factor that into your review whatsoever.  The largest reason being that the characters only share minor resemblances to the established ones. Donte and Vorgil are so drastically different than their DMC3/4 counterparts that they should just be marketed as different characters in a different universe.  For example, how many times has Batman, Superman, Spiderman, etc origin stories retold? They always keep the character pretty much the same though.  Batman lost both of his parents, is afraid of bats, uses technology to help him solve mysteries and fight criminals. Thats consistent in all of his reboots.  Superman was sent away from Krypton as it was exploding, uses the Clark Kent secret identity and saves the world with his speed, strength, flight, ice breath, X-Ray vision and heat vision.  With good reboots, the characters aren't drastically altered.  With Donte and Vorgil, almost everything got changed. Sparda and Mundus are now brothers? Eva was an Angel? Wtf? Vergil is no longer an honorable combatant who seeks to gain power above all else, Dante no longer has a demon hunting business, Trish and Lady are completely absent.  The ONLY things that the actual Dante and Vergil have in common with the phonies are that Dante is cocky, uses twin pistols + a broadsword, Vergil is more calm and fights with a Katana and that they're both half demon brothers.   You can try and justify it by saying DmC is primarily an action game, but Ninja Theory made it quite clear that they were trying to make the story amazing ( ""Shakespearean writing to rival TV and Cinema"" anyone?) but the fact is that they failed HARD in pretty much EVERY aspect of the game and the sales figures reflect that. Its a good looking game with intense action, but thats literally ALL it has. The fact that they showcase the game running 60fps @ 1080p in 2015 is laughable and they even made a point out of showcasing this new and unheard of ""Lock-on"" feature. Neither of which were in the original 2013 release which is quite a failing by itself."
DevilMayCry,3445be,KevinLee487,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:39:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading and commenting!  While some of the story points are different (like Dante not having the business), does it really even matter? I think people put way too much stock into the story of a game series that is 99% stylish, fast action with a story loosely holding it together.  And how is Vergil not on a quest for absolute power? Did you play the DLC? Its pretty clear that he is.  The important parts of characters like Barman and Superman are their story, their morals, and their worlds. The important parts of a DMC game is that Dante is a rebellious ""cool guy"" who kills demons with flair. I think DmC nailed that."
DevilMayCry,3445be,KevinLee487,2,Wed Apr 29 23:17:56 2015 UTC,"While some of the story points are different (like Dante not having the business), does it really even matter?   Yes, the story may not be a strong point of the series, but its at least there. Ninja Theory took a few key elements of the story established in DMC1&3 and threw the entirety of the rest out of the window.  Vergil's attitude isn't that he was seeking power. He just wanted to rule over the humans because he was powerful. He doesn't feel that responsibility like the OG Vergil to attain absolute power at any means necessary. At least not from what I've seen.  Super hero reboots keep the characters the same. Look at all of the Batman games, movies and TV shows. The only drastic changes are his outfits.  Whereas with Donte, he doesn't have the lighthearted and goofy attitude that Dante has. He takes himself far too seriously. He comes off as a douchebag 16 year old kid who acts like what he perceives as cool. Hes the stereotypical ""doesn't give a fuck about anything"" kid.  Whereas Dante goofs off, shoots off 1 liners and is generally just having fun. Hell, he only has 2 serious moments in DMC4 and those take place at the very beginning and very end of the game.  Donte doesn't embody, mimic, embrace or even look like Dante and who he is. Donte has similarities, but he is NOT even close to the character he is supposed to be.  This seems to sum up my thoughts very well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0a_QlurNZU"

The box set contains:   The DMC 4 Special Edition game 85 page full color Production Note book Soundtrack Original storage box (the pizza box itself) 3 Cover Replacements (one of each of the guys, I'd guess) Lady & Trish costume and Red Orb download code   The latter two say something about being limited but I'm not entirely sure (hopefully someone who knows Japanese better can come in and comment).  The set costs 7398円 or roughly $62.20 and is available for PS4 and XB1.  No PC version listed.  It will be released June 18th."
DevilMayCry,340x5r,Iyouboushi,2,Mon Apr 27 16:49:45 2015 UTC,I don't see it listed on any retailer websites yet (such as amazon.co.jp or Play-Asia) but it should be possible when it pops up.  Play-Asia will probably be the easiest to ship to the USA as sites like Amazon require an intermediary (such as Tenso).

DevilMayCry,33srjo,Laminard,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:03:16 2015 UTC,"Loving Lady gameplay. I was afraid she would be just a Dante without a Sword, but her moves have a lot of eccentric properties. It gives me a DMC1 Dante's vibe - Fewer options but low redundancy.   Now Trish is just a beast. WIth her, a simple Killer Bee becomes an stun-trap. It's strange seeing so many heavy units stunned and helpless. It makes sense, though. After all, she has Sparda, the Santo Graal of this universe.  Seeing this gameplay is like waking up of a nightmare. DMC is back! All is well in this world."
DevilMayCry,33srjo,UnmannedSurveillance,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:34:31 2015 UTC,"They both have a lot of re-used animations... I'm honestly disappointed. Lady jumps way too high for a human and seems too quick overall. Trish stands exactly like Dante when there's enemies nearby. Lady's recovery animation is a direct cut and paste of Nero's, too. It's much too masculine for the both of them."
DevilMayCry,33r85n,Dreceratops,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"In DMC 4, different enemies fall at different speeds. For example, the base scarecrow falls faster than Dante, so you can't JC Aerial Rave forever. For Jump Cancelling Aerial Rave, you use the Style Button right? The Style Button and Jump  Button are close enough where I don't ""press"" style then cancel by ""pressing"" jump, I slide my thumb between the two. Refine your timing until you JC right as the sword makes contact, or else the enemy won't be affected by hitstun and they'll just fall.  If you haven't already seen it, ChaserTech has a video on jump cancelling which involves learning the basics and more advanced techniques."
DevilMayCry,33r85n,Dreceratops,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:53:28 2015 UTC,I did see ChaserTech's video actually its incredibly helpful. So should I slide my thumb between and literally press them at the same time? Or is that just to help me go between them faster? If I've just gotta up my button rate I'll work on that.
DevilMayCry,33r85n,ColdVergil,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:07:59 2015 UTC,It helps me go between them faster as opposed to lifting my thumb off jump and then pressing style.

The idea is that you're cancelling the move's recovery and/or combo with a jump and cancelling the jump's height gain.  Downed Mega Scarecrows in DMC4 are the best to practice on - even Donguri990 said it, and the black-hooded ones in DMC3/white-hooded ones."

DevilMayCry,33nekc,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"Well, the media and gregman have kept saying that the cutscene will add something to the canon and so far the only non-action stuff in there is this woman we don't know look interested in Vergil and we know that people have been wondering what is Nero's relation with Vergil so I don't blame any jump to conclusion really...  Agree on the past point, also what interesting to me is what does Vergil's mean by 'what is your true intention?' thing?  Sure he is going to investigate the order but why is he interested in them so much that he goes investigating? I mean Dante doesn't get interested in the order until Trish take Sparda to them...  While I think we won't get too much additional story, this cutscene seems to indicate that either we are going to get more 'plot' than what we thought or a hint for possible DMC 5, I hope..."
DevilMayCry,33nekc,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"She's probably looking at him because he looks extremely scary. i mean, seriously, random guy in a filthy brown hood and cloak with pristine clothing underneath? that just reeks of suspicious....ness....osity.....fuck.  If they wanted to imply something, they could have just given her a face instead of a generic hood, like they did with credo, kyrie, gloria, agnus, heck, even nero, despite having a hooded outfit, never opts to use it. point being, people are jumping to conclusions as far as I can see."
DevilMayCry,33nekc,TBAAAGamer1,2,Fri Apr 24 16:58:35 2015 UTC,"Or... As someone in /cgg/ jokingly said, her face is a plot twist because turns out she looks like Kyrie! And Kyrie is actually Nero's half sister! Or that Kyrie is actually never aging!  Kidding aside, because there will only two cutscene, the production team needs to be as efficient as possible just like DMC3SE opening is explaining how Vergil and Arkham met and how Vergil is on the tower, so I think it is safe to assume she is going to be important character but (in my opinion) they simply don't get budget from Capcom to make asset for non-playable character so they are resorted to generic hood...

DevilMayCry,33nekc,Illummizolldyck,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:45:31 2015 UTC,Because we finally have a specific origin for Nero. Even if it isn't Vergil's mom per say. NOW we know for a fact how Nero was formed. Though it could have been a prostitute because I read that kids made fun of Nero saying his mother was a prostitute since no one knew who she was. But meh it doesn't matter. What matters is that Vergil had business there and he did something that not even Dante has done for some reason... Which is odd...

After playing them all, the old games are my favorite but, DmC is worth a playthrough or two. DMC 4 is my all time favorite though. Hope this helped."
DevilMayCry,33h9un,chaospercival,4,Wed Apr 22 14:55:34 2015 UTC,"Well, DmC is like a nice way to get into the series because it was made to bring new fans into the saga because the previous ones were hard enough to discourage new players.  You, as a newcomer, won't have a bias mindset towards the game and see it in a neutral way, making you actually notice its pros and cons (because most of the people who talk negatively about DmC are REALLY bias).  Now, DmC DE fixed a bunch of mistakes they did on the previous one, so the enjoyment factor is bigger and it has way more content and replay value, so if you're a fan of fast paced action games, pick it up, for its price and its content its worth it imo.  If the hard and challenging tales about the Original DMC saga doesn't scare you, or even better, ""motivate"" you, you should try out the originals (if you have a ps3 you should get DMC HD, which has all the 3 originals), trust me, no argument needed here... DMC4 SE is worth it in every way possible... even if still half a game.."

DevilMayCry,33h9un,Davidzeero,2,Wed Apr 29 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"DmC vanilla makes it easier to juggle stuff for fun. DmC:DE has tighter frame adjustments and is more for the hardcore crowd. In my opinion if you want an easy intro into the series's combat, DmC was, by design, just for that. it'll give you an idea as to what you're getting into, then you can try later games and GET REKT HARD- but, not as badly as if you were playing dmc3 for the first time."
DevilMayCry,33h9un,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:58:25 2015 UTC,I started playing DMC3 yesterday for the first time.  I got REKT like never before.  honestly probably the hardest game I have played in a long ass time.  yes beating even dark souls
DevilMayCry,33h9un,AzuresX19,2,Mon Apr 27 22:01:43 2015 UTC,"This is literally why DmC exists. it was always about a foot in the door, though admittedly, it's preferential. some people like getting repeatedly rekt over and over, gives em a sense of accomplishment. that said, DmC is just good fun with the basis of devil may cry combat fine tuned for juggling more than actual challenging combat. you can juggle EVERYTHING in DmC, just get used to just charges and even butchers will be sent flying."

DevilMayCry,33g3ye,Davidzeero,2,Wed Apr 22 06:21:06 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to think of who best represents the DMC 4 scene at the moment. Most of the players who are currently active are probably better than the Polygon guy and could help show off the gameplay. Did Sam D actually stream for DE, or did he just help make the promo videos? There are way too many players that I want to see stream SE but Capcom can't afford to fly them all over to stream."

To be honest, i don't know who can show the very best of DMC4 either since they are so many good players out there that are quite active lately, so i guess it should be Capcom's decision... perhaps they get the easiest to contact? idk...

Well, i won't bother that much for the ""mediocre"" performance he did because he was explaining bit by bit the mechanics of the characters, instead of doing sick combos or showing their potential...  Lady.. well, i couldnt see too much from her, but at least she got some power with her guns..  Trish on the other hand, CROWD CONTROL GOD... i think she is the one on par with vergil, or perhaps even better... and i like her breakdance ligthing kicks... she is badass...  Vergil is the one we have seen a lot now, so nothing new here, but still, awesome...  My only concern now is Dante and, especially, Nero... If they don't give them some buffs or new moves, they're going to be overshadowed by the rest of the cast... Of course, people will still use Dante because of how complex he is and the combos potential... but Nero...? He needs more moves, otherwise, we migth never see him again..."

DevilMayCry,33e1mo,MarkS00N,2,Tue Apr 21 21:31:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, I will begin commenting with negative thought then positive thought...  Lady  I am going to main the character and still going to, but I won't lie that I am disappointed that her most damaging moves (the multiple hit with Kalina Ann beside hysteria) seems to take too long to be used, makes it seems unable to comboed in to another moves...  I also never like charge shoot (either in Nero or Dante) because it doesn't really fit the fast pace of the game (and in Nero's case it reduce the moves that Blue Rose get due to how important the charge shoot is for Nero), so I am not that amused by Lady's version (which seems to apply to all her gun) especially because Lady only has guns...  But, I like the fact that she seems to have a lot of unique moveset for her gun, the double rocket jump (wow!), and the creative use of her grapple hook...  What currently puzzled me is what her button layout would be?  I use PS controller for reference, so her attack button would be square (gun button) while the bayonet is triangle (sword button). I thought Kalina Ann going to be circle (style button), but as the videos shown she needs to switch her weapon before she can use Kalina Ann...  Thus this beg some question: Would her melee weapon change as she switch weapon? What is the function of her circle button? Does it means her attack moveset going to be split between her square and circle button like Dante's gunslinger? If that so, isn't it unnecessarily complicated?  I really can't wait to have more information on her and play as her.  Trish  My disappoint stem from her seemingly copy paste moveset. I think I see some new moves (beside the obvious Pandora on air), but beside that I think her moves will copy heavily from Rebellion and Gilgamesh (plus Beowulf), while having lightning properties in her Devil Form...  So what I think the good thing from Trish here? Pandora's. Revenge. On. Air. Enough said.  Also it appears she has gauge for her round trip, this makes me think that she has special movement available to her circle button (her Sparda button if I am not mistaken) when Sparda is away from her (in form of hand to hand combat of course) thus her hand to hand option would probably more extensive than what has been shown (maybe her supposedly spinning kick launcher comes from here? Because she has rising dragon, so if the spinning kick launch her enemy I don't think they would implement two launcher in same button)..."

DevilMayCry,33aatk,UnmannedSurveillance,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"One thing i've noticed, he retains his DmC counterpart's crosscut, as well as what appear to be mini-judgment cut pause combos. he has a pretty insane sword flurry going on, and his yamato's range with some moves appears to be very broad (I.E. Soft crowd control) His summons swords do not seem to juggle, though storm swords still retain their ""send an enemy flying into the air"" thing. sword barrier does not share its ground juggle properties that I can see from DmC, but it looks like it can do some damage. I also see a lot of nelo angelo summoned sword play going on, which is nice. Vergil's final judgment doesn't seem to do much damage to bosses, so maybe it's a good way to finish a boss as opposed to a devastating damage option? rapid slash is so fast i wasn't even sure i was looking at it the first time I saw it, it was instant and with no slash effects that i could see, or they were so fast that I wasn't able to keep up. all in all vergil looks like he's a super fast, high damage high input character, which is very different from his dmc3 appearance but more or less similar to his DmC counterpart.  I'd say we may be getting the most balanced middle ground between the original calm classic vergil and DmC's heavy damaging input heavy insane speed vergil."

This might be a pause combo into Roulette, or they'll manage to stick classic Aerial Rave in there somehow.   I never doubted that Starfall/Killer Bee would return and now it's finally confirmed.  Rising Dragon confirmed, we'll miss you Rising Sun. I'm certain we see him charging a punch, but he gets hit and can't follow through. I can't tell if all his attacks will be chargeable or if it was just his uppercut. Also hoping he gets the Crazy Combo input.  I honestly never expected him to get Drive, but it's a cool addition.

DevilMayCry,32w5m6,Dreceratops,5,Fri Apr 17 06:10:01 2015 UTC,"Capcom did the unthinkable and actually made an effort. The Capcom JP stream definitely had a super costume on, so we can't fully be sure of his power level, but his non DT/concentration stuff still looks dope as fuck.   A lot of things look better than I was expecting. I thought they would just port over his DMC 3 moves and update him visually. I'm liking concentration and all of the added moves and I'm trying to figure out just what their inputs are going to be. Beowulf gets Kick 13 somehow? Force Edge has a move taken from Agni and Rudra? DT RAPID SLASH INTO A LAUNCHER? There is too much cool, unexpected stuff to name.  The few disappointments I have:   *No stand-alone Rising Sun. I mean, it's cool they added it to DT Lunar Phase, but it was so cool that it really deserves it's own input.  *Air stinger was a pleasant surprise that immediately became just kinda good instead of amazing. I'm thankful that they gave Force Edge another aerial move but I really expected something like Nero's Calibur. Instead, we get the DmC Calibur that needs to connect with the enemy to get any forward movement.   *I never expected much story closure, but I think we're all disappointed he's just getting a few cutscenes.   For just casual players, I think Vergil is going to totally outclass Nero. Grim Trick is similar in a lot of ways to the Devil Bringer, but Vergil just has a bunch of high-damage, cool tricks to use. Vergil might be on par with Dante, but requires a lot less technical skill. Getting good at style switching on the D-pad is really hard, and if Vergil can do stylish things without having to mess with styles he might be the go-to for high-level play. Unless Dante and Nero get changes or buffs, I think Vergil will be the character to play."
DevilMayCry,32w5m6,Dreceratops,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:43:39 2015 UTC,"While I definitely agree with you, I would personally add that I wouldn't really call anything a disappointment.  Having said that I'm sure there are people out there that had different expectations for Vergil but with all the discussions that have been going on in this place I think for the most part we all agreed before hand to not hold our expectations too high since we couldn't be sure what the result would be.  So while I second the opinion that the Force Edge could be given better aerial moves (and to be honest the low level gameplay video isn't much of an indication of whether or not it has more moves), I think you'll agree that while we might say there are things we'd prefer, none of this seems to be an actual disappointment so far."

DevilMayCry,32oq19,goddamn_owl,14,Wed Apr 15 14:15:51 2015 UTC,Gameplay was pretty awesome. Looks like Vergil is going to be a crowd control god.
DevilMayCry,32oq19,DarkDigiDragon,4,Wed Apr 15 14:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it looks like Vergil may be specifically designed for the Legendary Dark Knight mode, which fills the screen with tons of enemies."
DevilMayCry,32oq19,Forever_Zero,7,Wed Apr 15 17:37:10 2015 UTC,"It seems so, but Vergil was great at crowd control since DMC3SE. Some of Vergil's new attack are friggin' pure crowd control: that super dimensional rapid slash. It seems Yamato is for crowding, Beowulf is most likely for single target, and Force Edge is both. That's my opinion, anyways."
DevilMayCry,32oq19,KhalNayak76,4,Wed Apr 15 18:50:25 2015 UTC,"I think you might be right with the specific roles for each weapon. Unfortunately, this guy wasn't the best player and didn't seem to be too used to the game. I can't wait to see Vergil in the hands of pros though, it's going to be amazing how they use him."
DevilMayCry,32oq19,DarkDigiDragon,2,Wed Apr 15 18:58:29 2015 UTC,Indeed. Vergil has always been superior at CC and general monster slaying while Dante has had more defensive and tactical styles so he's favourable for bosses.
DevilMayCry,32oq19,UnmannedSurveillance,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"Looked like it, his screen clearing attack was BALLER"
DevilMayCry,32oq19,TBAAAGamer1,12,Wed Apr 15 23:29:23 2015 UTC,"So Vergil now is top tier.... We still need to know more to know about him to see if he is better than Dante, but clearly this showed us that he is crazier and better than DmC Vergil..."
DevilMayCry,32oq19,Davidzeero,3,Wed Apr 15 15:21:43 2015 UTC,The guy playing wasn't even that good either. Even so I don't see Virgil being better than Dante in terms of combo variety. It'll probably just come down to personal preference.
DevilMayCry,32oq19,l0stinthought,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"Well this depends, how is the Dante combo? I don't know it so yeahh.. However Vergil has very nice combos and setups, like spiral swords to blistering with beowulf combos into aerial rave (dmc3se) etc, unless you're talking about JC MAD combos. Vergil will be a very good combo character, judging by him attacks from the gameplay shown. Also, the guy playing was bad, as you've said... But some people (alexdmd; fantastic combo-er I've seen) can rip bosses apart."
DevilMayCry,32oq19,KhalNayak76,3,Wed Apr 15 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"Assuming Dante pretty much stays the same as he was in DMC4 he has so many different ways to create combos. It's been a while since I played DMC4 but I'll try to break it down and I'm sure others will correct me where they can.  Dante has 5 styles that he can switch between during attacks. He has 3 different melee weapons and 3 different projectile weapons, one of which can be used in 3 different ways.   Virgil has 3 different weapons and 1 projectile that he can use in a variety of ways. And then he's got that combo meter thing which I still don't completely get but I'm looking forward to it nonetheless.  Virgil is my favorite character from DMC3:SE. When DMC4 came out I felt like Dante was sort of made to have some of the skills that Virgil had so while I missed Virgil, I wasn't exactly pining for him either. I loved the fact that Dante could switch styles in game and there were just so many ways to mix it up.   So basically I'm not saying Dante is going to be better than Virgil, but he'll just have more room for creativity. I've never been able to fully use Dante the way I feel like he can be used or the way I've seen him being used in youtube videos.  Anyways I'm still really excited about playing with Virgil and he is still going to be my favorite character. I already have DMC4 for PS3, but I'm ready to get DMC4:SE for PC just so I can play with Virgil."

DmC's complexity lay primarily in the physics engine, new dante's moveset was almost entirely centered around taking advantage of enemy motion in mid-air combos.  it's a shame, the game was solid, but the execution of its theme, not so much. even so I still enjoy it."

Max-Act isn't exactly frame perfect, but it still takes a time investment in order to get the timing down. Level 3 charge shot is a launcher with a delayed launcher at the end, so an expert would need to be able to make use of that final launcher somehow. Summoned swords are also pretty tricky to use as there is a delayed summoning time and travel time but they suspend the enemy in useful ways. Table-hopper and every enemy's buster counter has their own timing you have to learn as well.   tl;dr: Nero isn't as simple as he seems and requires a lot of work to learn all his timings."
DevilMayCry,324vn1,Dreceratops,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, Nero isn't as simple as he seems at first glance. That's why I'm asking this question, to see where individual player would place him amongst other characters in the series in order of difficulty."
DevilMayCry,324vn1,Dreceratops,3,Fri Apr 10 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, whoops. I'd have to put him below DMC 3 Dante and Vergil and DMC 4 Dante. I think he's tied with DmC Dante because while Dante has more total moves (I think,) I'd say Nero has a lot more mechanics he needs to keep in mind. Also, Nero just feels faster than Dante, even on turbo, so it may be harder to learn. And while DmC has weird jump canceling mechanics that make every enemy JC the same, DMC 4 has enemies that fall at different speeds and have different amounts of knockback when hit, so with Nero you'd have to learn how to deal with each enemy."
DevilMayCry,324vn1,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:07:48 2015 UTC,Ok awesome that's pretty much the kind of answer I was looking for from everyone... I was just curious to see if different people had different experiences trying to increase their skill with Nero.  Whenever I've had the discussion with friends we've all ranked him completely differently compared to the difficulty of other characters so I figured I'd pose the question to a wider demographic.
DevilMayCry,324vn1,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"if you want to max nero out, you gotta learn his exceed windows and buster. but honestly, he's a very straightforward character otherwise, dante is by far more complicated."
DevilMayCry,324vn1,Warsc2k,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm aware of this, just wondering what people's opinions were on his difficulty ranking compared to each iteration of all the other characters in each game of the series (including DmC).  I'm not asking whether or not people find him difficult."
DevilMayCry,324vn1,Warsc2k,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:55:30 2015 UTC,his exceed would make him roughly a seven or a six.
DevilMayCry,324vn1,DeathDevilize,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:14:25 2015 UTC,"It honestly depends on what do you mean by difficulty.  Both Nero and Dante have moves (and glitches) that should be grinded into your muscle memory. MAX-Act, Guard Flying and Starrave come to mind.  Dante has a lot more depth, but they're both equal in terms of difficulty. It comes down to how much time you want to sink into them, really."
DevilMayCry,324vn1,Warsc2k,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"I guess if I had to elaborate slightly on what I mean by difficulty, I'm basically asking people for their individual experiences on how much effort they had to put into Nero to get better compared directly to their time and effort needed to get better at the other characters in the series.  Does that make more sense? I'm trying to word my question properly but it's kind of technical so I guess I'm having trouble getting it across."
DevilMayCry,324vn1,Chaotix247,2,Fri Apr 10 18:25:20 2015 UTC,"Dante's harder than Nero in that regard.  As Nero, you just need to find the sweet-spot for MAX-Act and the likes and just keep spamming it over and over and over until you can do it effortlessly.  As Dante, you need to master Starrave, double weapon-switching, guard flying, style switching, Lucifer, RG and RR timings.  DMC4 Dante > DMC3 Dante > Nero > DMC3 Vergil > DmC: DmC Dante > DMC1 Dante > DmC: DmC Vergil > DMC2 Dante.  DMC3 Dante is basically Nero with weapon switching and styles.  DMC3 Vergil: Blowhard  DmC: DmC Dante has some skill to it (yes, I said it). We're talking about mastering a character and its moveset here, not about how easy it is to pick up. Michellegun201 is a good example, compared to, say, me  I don't understand how DMC1's combat system works. I find it sluggish and I dislike it because of that.  DmC: DmC Vergil is pretty lackluster. Sure, you can do shit with him, but it's not that hard. I'd recommend a keyboard/mouse setup for this one, because of the layout. Check the first part of my video to see what I mean.  DMC2 Dante has no style, grace and he has a funny face but he has a sick character design. No depth tho, rip."
DevilMayCry,324vn1,KevinLee487,-7,Fri Apr 10 19:55:11 2015 UTC,DmC Vergil is deeper than dmc3 Dante.
DevilMayCry,325949,TBAAAGamer1,2,Fri Apr 10 18:11:35 2015 UTC,http://www.reddit.com/r/DevilMayCry/comments/324vn1/difficulty_of_nero/cq83g16  I stand by my point that DMC4's Dante is the deepest character as long as this and as long as Donguri-senpai~ exist.

I guess there's just the downside of it makes you feel like you're not really fighting something that's a threat anymore when it's simply no longer able to attack you that often.  That and trying to get MAX Exceeds makes my head hurt.

DevilMayCry,31yd5e,omegaAnubis,6,Thu Apr 9 12:44:04 2015 UTC,"its generally regarded that 2 is the worst game in the franchise, so your distaste of the endgame isn't an uncommon thing around here  timeline wise, you don't even need to play 2 to understand what is going on with the series, as all the other games take place beforehand.  i would suggest jumping to 3. its a prequel to 1, and yes, it is regarded by fans to be the best of the series (though it looks like 4 specal edition will contest that). just be warned that 3 is also the hardest in the series by a good bit.  good tidings and have fun."

DevilMayCry,31yd5e,Davidzeero,2,Thu Apr 9 19:19:21 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the DMC universe!  Devil May Cry 2 is regarded as the worst of the franchise and i agree with that. The game... oh god... i had no fun at all with it... and you can take my word... as a guy who didn't enjoy the game, i completed it 4 times... 2 times with dante, 1 with lucia and 1 with trish in lucia's campaign... Lucia's campaign is basically the SAME thing, but backwards... just 2 different levels and enemies... IT'S NOT WORTH IT! For the plot... just like you said, it really didn't make sense, and it basically destroyed the DMC timeline, not literally, but no one wants to continue the ""Plot"" in that regard. Trish doesn't have any relation to the plot here (again, they screwed it up) but she is in the game playable in both campaigns.  Devil May Cry 3 it is regarded the best game of the series, superior to the others except for Devil May Cry 4(combat wise)... again, i agree with this, its my favorite DMC game to date. Trust me, dissapointment here is impossible, just don't give up, as the game can be quite hard at first (DMC3 is the hardest aswell)  Have a nice time dude!  P.S. It doesn't matter what people tell you, you should try out DmC and judge it yourself, the game itself it's quite fun but it can't really be fairly compared to the rest fo the franchise, besides, it has been confirmed to be its own running series, so treat it as such and don't worry for it replacing DMC if you dislike it."
DevilMayCry,31yd5e,Dreceratops,2,Thu Apr 9 06:24:04 2015 UTC,I already bought DmC I've really heard a mix bag on that game I know it's fans love it so I figured why not. It only cost me 10 dollars.  Thanks so much for your response I plan to start the third one when I get off work tonight.

DevilMayCry,31yd5e,KirillianAmurawr,2,Thu Apr 9 17:28:33 2015 UTC,"You can continue through 2 if you're a real completion/masochist. Finishing the rest of 2 will make 3 all the sweeter, but you should probably avoid more self-harm and just move on to the best game in the series. DMC 4 has insane combat depth but 3 blows it out of the water in every other aspect. The only ""real"" flaw of 3 is that there are 1 or 2 gimmicky or lackluster bosses in a pool of amazing ones. Also, even if you've gone through DMC 1 and 2, 3 may have a near vertical learning curve, but you may enjoy that."

DevilMayCry,31ryd6,Davidzeero,7,Tue Apr 7 18:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, got the information elsewhere so I just figured it would be up here anyway. Looks like this subreddit could use more attention after all, so thanks for the post.  Also, to clarify, those songs are from the character bio pages on the website. It hasn't been confirmed that they are each character's theme either in cutscenes or during gameplay. Vergil already has another theme being remade aside from the website's music, and the original DMC 4 website had music that wasn't used in the final game. So, while it's possible, these songs aren't necessarily going to be where you would expect in the game itself."
DevilMayCry,31ryd6,scionicspectre,3,Tue Apr 7 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, they appear in the bio pages, however since everyone seems to be saying its their battle theme, i just agreed on it, however you may be right and this might be the song we will hear during the new cutscenes...

A part of me is sad it isn't the theme from vergil 2, but at the same time I suppose a song like that would be too epic to use for every fight against sandbags :p  I'm a huge sucker for vocals though, so if SE vergil's theme kicks in some vocals like it does in the trailer, that would be the most amazing thing"

But im not dissapointed at all with Vergil's theme, its super rad! I still think Lady/Trish theme is out of place, but its not bad a bad song..."
DevilMayCry,31ryd6,Dethal,3,Tue Apr 7 20:54:41 2015 UTC,"Lady/Trish theme, is just a theme, imo. I really bet that they'll get their own battle music... Reminder Hopefully they will just remix it, and will add some lyrics over it, that would be enough for me. As for Lady... Lady's theme might be either remix of some older songs, either a completely new one, but i swear, it WILL NOT be a dubstep song. As for Vergil's theme... Well, it sounds good(I would love to get some vocals though). But, then again, all of those are just music from the bio pages... But we'll see, with time."
DevilMayCry,31ryd6,UnmannedSurveillance,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, i agree, perhaps Lady/Trish theme is related to their opening or ending cutscene..

I do youtube as well (not very well might I add, I half half of your subscriber base) and I do mostly DMC4 as it stands. That game is also atrociously loud. The way I do it is, seeing as you are doing smaller videos as well in terms of length (nothing over 30 minutes), record your audio through audacity and don't record your vocals through your other recording software, then use something like windows movie maker so that the emphasis is put on narration. That way whenever the game audio peeks your narration will trump it. It works rather well."

If you hold on to it, the worst case scenario is that you end up hating the game for missing something that isn't ultimately all that significant to your prolonged enjoyment of the game. I won't be surprised if we have entire threads dedicated to how angry people are that Vergil gets little story emphasis.  I think it's wrong to say Capcom 'fucked it up' if they don't reveal Nero's parentage. Even still, I bet some people would be more angry if they revealed Nero not to be Vergil's son at all compared to just not talking about it."
DevilMayCry,31mdrg,scionicspectre,4,Mon Apr 6 16:38:39 2015 UTC,"Don't expect anything huge from Special Edition, you'll probably just end up disappointed. Sure, there may not be huge additions to the story in SE, but think about what SE signifies: Capcom is revisiting a series that was thought to be dead and are actually getting hype from the community by touching up a 7 year old title. Sure, there aren't story implications now, but a DMC 5 where those implications may be visited is much more likely."
DevilMayCry,31mdrg,Dreceratops,4,Mon Apr 6 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"Its an asspull for money more than anything, but I'd be willing to bet money on it that they're gauging community reaction to see if there is still interest (and money to be made) with the original DMC universe.   Being that this is the 2nd time Vergil has been added as an afterthought with overwhelmingly positive feedback, I'm hoping Capcom will come to their senses and either give us a Vergil game that brings him back into the current timeline instead of us not knowing weather he is truly gone or not. OR including him as a fully playable character from the get-go.  With his extremely vague demise in DMC1, they could easily bring him back. Maybe he finally comes to his damn senses and teams up with Dante. They don't have to be all buddy buddy, but it would be nice to see them get along to some degree. The Arkham fight showed that they're perfectly capable to teaming up.  Mundus said that he would return, what better reason is there to have D&V team up than to take down Mundus?"
DevilMayCry,31mdrg,KevinLee487,2,Mon Apr 6 21:57:38 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping so too. There are many possibilities, seeing as we see Vergil fighting Dante and pretty much replacing other characters in battles we have seen before. Personally I don't see why they felt the need to create this game. Sure it's great as I love as much DMC as I can get but really, they may as well have invested in a new game. I honestly think that the purpose of this game is to shift all the attention and legacy away from Nero and put it back into the original characters.  Back to the story, I've heard that the timeline in which Vergil visits the Island is completely different to the main story line we are used to. Yet, they collide for whatever reason. My bet is that Nero is a back up host body for Vergil, I know it's pretty far off but in all honesty Nero was ridiculously supercharged for someone of his breed (assuming Vergil took up those relations with a real human female). Vergil and Dante in DMC are Cambion (half human, half demon) and even their powers were limited until DMC 4 where we saw Dante in his prime. Nero is Half human, Half Cambion, yet he had a physical manifestation of demonic power that did not take form of a foreign body ie. swords, devil arms. His weapon was a literal devil arm, his devil arm, his celestial form took the appearance of Yamato.  Nero, despite being a young rookie was able to hold his own against Dante, he could manage. I would hope that perhaps he was calibrating his abilities to adapt to a body takeover. Anywho, this is just me and if we know Capcom only old, ugly people die. So that means that my theory and hopes are redundant nobody dies but vergil.  Likely scenario, Vergil goes to the island to take over order, he is defeated by dante (amidst confusion) or by himself (because his is a tad mental from what we gather in the trailer hearing voices in his head and all) and is then further defeated by the order, who clone him to create Nero and retain the Yamato until Nero was old enough and strong enough to serve their interests. Vergil writes some dumb ass letter and mails the amulet to Dante whom realises this means that the legacy has been passed on and asks for Dante to look out for the Child and be the father figure they never had.  When Nero is of age, the whole 'family' visits the island to protect and check up on him I guess.  The reason why I think cloning is such a huge part of the story when it comes to Nero and the purpose of having Vergil in the storyline is because Trish was a clone of Eva with demonic power. It's not a foreign concept to the series. I honestly hope Vergil doesn't die again.   Edit, Vergil also shatters his blade within the final battle against the order to ensure nobody can wield it as he realises what a mess he has made (as per usual), the Order however hold onto it and spend decades trying to decipher the secrets behind it's portal closing and opening power."
DevilMayCry,31mdrg,P3RR01,2,Mon Apr 6 13:14:33 2015 UTC,"Vergil can't mail his amulet to Dante, as we know Dante got the amulet in DMC1 after beating Vergil.  And Vergil would NEVER EVER willingly part with his half of the amulet."

DevilMayCry,31mdrg,TBAAAGamer1,0,Mon Apr 6 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"definitely a cash grab, if he wasn't he wouldn't have all those old weapons that he lost as quickly as he acquired them. he has both force edge and beowulf, despite never having them before or after dmc3. this has cash grab written all over it imo."
DevilMayCry,31mdrg,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:04:11 2015 UTC,"About his weapons, maybe it's just a plothole, because at the end of the day he needs unique weapons for his gameplay, they probably forgot that he lost them. Another thing, we saw him with a cape on, the ""typical vest of a traveller"", I dunno how to put it, but it really feels like the story of his travel I explained could be a reality. It also appears that he has some unique cutscenes, that appear during the trailer, so it might not be just a playable character with no background.  EDIT: This is Vergil's description:   Vergil is Dante's twin brother, and he also carries the bloodline of Sparda. Unlike Dante, he embraces his demonic heritage. Intrigued by the Order of the Sword, who worship Sparda as a god, he pays a visit to Fortuna many years before Dante's arrival.   Guess I was right lol Instant buy for me."
DevilMayCry,31mdrg,Exiled851,-4,Wed Apr 8 01:03:07 2015 UTC,"Asspull. Complete asspull. Same costume/look from DMC3, DT, and moves aside from the moves they took from vergil in DmC. They pretty much just took the 3D model and animations from the ps2 and just updated them. It's all just a money grab because they know they can and people will eat it up. Even adding lady and Trish I'm sure Trish's moves won't be much different from dmc2 and lady's are most likely a revamp of her boss battle moves."

I don't think it was the fans who only saw hair color"
DevilMayCry,31jhxu,TBAAAGamer1,14,Sun Apr 5 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with your statement, but if you're going to title your post that,   Things DMC as a franchise can take from DmC:    A tutorial that's better than garbage A training mode, no matter how barebones it is That little shine that indicates the start of a pause combo Must Style from Definitive Edition Starting a combo with one wep, but initiating a pause combo with another    Everything else is either subjective or would be a detriment to the series."
DevilMayCry,31jhxu,Dreceratops,3,Sun Apr 5 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"DmC may have done a lot of stuff poorly, but it at least wanted to be a tutorial game for the series. and when it came to that? it did that very well. I'll always see DmC as a sort of ""spinoff tutorial game"" than a main canon replacement. when i view it in this light, not only does it make perfect sense in the series, it actually becomes more enjoyable to play, as i'm not trying to hold it to the same standards.  besides, playing as vergil in this version is a blast, i don't think a single classic or spinoff devil may cry character, dante included, has ever been quite this fun. and dante rode demons like skateboards. actually, i take it back. dmc3 dante was marginally more fun to play than DmC vergil in light of having some pretty entertaining situational stuff not seen in 4 (namely pole spinning and demon riding, as well as quicksilver and doppelganger)"
DevilMayCry,31jhxu,PM_ME_STAB_WOUNDS,4,Sun Apr 5 18:57:52 2015 UTC,"Starting a combo with one wep, but initiating a pause combo with another     This is mostly an aesthetic thing, but I can't help but notice how classic dante seems incapable of this (even in cutscenes) while vergil does this all the time. If you consider vergil's complete kit to be yamato, beowulf, and force edge, particularly when using force edge he switches between all his weapons without pause.  With his habit of weapon juggling it becomes obvious that the big reason vergil practices iaido (instead of any other, more practical style) is so he can smoothly stab you with yamato, put it away, and murder you some more with a different weapon. I think it's for this reason that classic vergil always felt like he had better animations, while new vergil seems stiff and doesn't know what he's doing.   Where old vergil would sheathe yamato so he could punch you, throw force edge, or do some crazy full-body whirlwind kick, new vergil only does it because the old vergil does and he doesn't know why.   Sorry for of topic, but his animations always bothered me and this suddenly helped me realize why"
DevilMayCry,31jhxu,KevinLee487,2,Sun Apr 5 22:27:15 2015 UTC,"Part of Vergil's character is that he is a better swordsman/combatant than Dante due to embracing his Demonic heritage. Even going off of their in-game animations, Vergil is much more fluid and focused. Dante just kind of wings it and tries to be over the top with his style.  Just look at the way he uses Force Edge and Beowulf as opposed to how Dante uses Rebellion and Beowulf/Gilgamesh. Vergil is fast, direct and fluid. Every movement he makes is necessary and leads into another strike/swing. Dante swings Rebellion around like a madman and has some impromptu abilities that would seem like great ideas to someone who is just winging it. coughMillionStabcough.   If you notice, in DMC4, Dante even copies some of Vergil's abilities from DMC3. His entire moveset with Yamato is him directly trying to copy Vergil. Then with Gilgamesh, the last 2 hits of the basic combo are from Vergil double roundhouse kicking with Beowulf. He even implements Rising Sun into his Devil Trigger version of Kick 13."
DevilMayCry,31jhxu,krynnmeridia,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that's because he has so many cancels at his disposal that he doesn't need to pause a combo and switch into another move, you can literally stop what he's doing and set him up for another move so quickly that it generates a combo almost as smoothly as his counterpart. i'm not even joking about those cancels, he's got so many that it makes him broken."

DevilMayCry,315pmp,ColdVergil,3,Thu Apr 2 04:48:55 2015 UTC,With this and MGS V: The Phantom Pain... The level of hype inside of me is so big I think i'm going to explode soon enough.
DevilMayCry,315pmp,Dreceratops,2,Thu Apr 2 04:51:45 2015 UTC,"Yessssss this is great. It's all the info from that Famitsu scan and more.   Force Edge's DT Stinger looks a lot like Dante's, so it might have a similar piercing ability.  When I first saw this, I was hyped for the return of Rising Sun. But then I read a fan translation that implied that those rising kicks were part of DT Lunar Phase. This info seems to confirm that DT Lunar Phase combos into Rising Sun, but Rising Sun does not get it's own input.  Concentration seems to act like Nero's Exceed did. Keep it high by doing well and you can do all his crazy attacks. My worry about it is that I don't know what counts as ""missing a move."" Every Vergil combo video has reverse Helm Breakers to get to the ground faster. Also, does deflecting projectiles count as missing?  I'm assuming ""three variations"" of the Yamato combo means two additional pause combos or something. I'm assuming the last hit will be a crazy combo like Dante's Trillion Stabs.  Looks like Judgement Cut takes the form of 4's Dimensional Slash/DmC's Judgement Cut instead of it's form from 3.   Beowulf Combo A sounds like the combo from DMC 3, and Combo B sounds like it'll end with a Crazy Combo like Dante's.  Lunar Phase works both in the air and the ground, but no mention of Rising Sun or Beast Uppercut. Now we wait.  Stinger and Round Trip seem unchanged. No mention of it's combos, so I'm waiting for that.   Not sure how to feel about the changes to Air Trick. DmC Vergil had to teleport via summoned swords because there was no lock-on. He has to land a sword and then teleport to it, while Vergil in 3 could just teleport to whatever he was locked on to. But because of DmC's stance system, you could specify if you wanted to teleport to them or to teleport them to you. I will admit I'm interested in seeing how/if he telports between multiple embedded enemies, but it just sounds like a downgrade right now.  That is, if it's still mapped to the style button. With the changes to Air Trick and no real look at his movement options yet, I have no idea if Darkslayer will be ported over as is. His HUD doesn't have any style indicator, and all the info so far suggest he just has his one style. If Air Trick is somehow mapped to his gun button, I'll have no idea what his style button does.   This time around, Vergil seems to have lost/changed a few of his iconic moves, but he gains a whole lot as well. I'm also glad to see that Capcom is actually giving us info, and good info at that. I was pretty pessimistic before, but DMC 4 SE is shaping up to be really hype."
DevilMayCry,315pmp,TBAAAGamer1,2,Thu Apr 2 05:48:13 2015 UTC,Nice observation! I'll sure miss those DMC 3 moves but with all these new ones its going to be great. That teleport from DmC could be fun.
DevilMayCry,315pmp,kampasta,2,Thu Apr 2 06:11:59 2015 UTC,"if it's a broken as its DmC counterpart, then sword teleporting is going to make this game a blast. DmC vergil's sword teleport also juggles, so it can be used to extend an air combo on stuff like titans."
DevilMayCry,315pmp,TBAAAGamer1,2,Thu Apr 2 06:22:13 2015 UTC,"in every DMC game, nailing a projectile out of the air with a melee attack grants huge style points.  I'm pretty sure it won't count as missing in this case"

They don`t claim they create him or anything, but they can pretty much do what they want with him (in this case, make him a character). This happening opens possibilities of adding more characters from Capcom due to the shared license they have in Sm4sh, So getting Dante could be more simple than any other character with no license relation with nintendo..

DevilMayCry,30yb7g,mastersword130,3,Sun Apr 5 02:52:35 2015 UTC,"18, the Netherlands, I think they made one of the best designed and funniest characters of gaming into an unlikable and ugly character. From how he looks to how he acts. Instead of wise-cracks and good lines they went with swearing all the time. The hair isn't the thing that's wrong here. But they went with a dirty, gritty look. That's whats wrong with the design.  Also the gameplay was too dumbed down to make it more flashy. But in the old DMC's you made it flashy if you are good enough.   All with all the game felt like Devil May Cry made for a ""wider audience"" and I absolutely hate it."
DevilMayCry,30yb7g,Inconsistant-tone,3,Tue Mar 31 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"18, New Zealand.  The character design i'm not too fond of. The personality isn't great like OG Dante but it has some potential to grow I guess."

DmC Dante is fine appearance-wise, I've gotten over it (looks decent with the white hair), except for the way his face and mouth move when he talks looking gross to me somehow.  But personality-wise, I loathe the guy from what I've seen so far. His comedic moments fall flat, his badass moments do not impress me, and comes off as a failure to understand that you can be stupid yet cool, as was the case with Dante from Devil May Cry 3 & 4."
DevilMayCry,30yb7g,HayabusaZeroZ,2,Wed Apr 1 04:45:48 2015 UTC,"twenty something ( i stopped counting when they stopped celebrating)  Houseless college student looking for an apartment  My opinion of DmC is that it was designed and tooled specifically as a tutorial for its hardcore counterparts, it was made specifically to help you explore and understand various forms of combo tech that you wouldn't even realize existed had you played the classics on your own (unless you spent years with the game) the idea was clearly to inform the players of tech and let them experiment in an easier devil may cry, this way they would go back, play the other games and by then have a better idea as to how the game plays.  supporting this, there are countless mini-tutorials that have relevance to dmc3 and dmc4 enemy mechanics such as opponent specific parries, the loading screen gives clear indication of jump canceling mechanics and vergil's shop forces you to purchase just charged attacks, making you go back and explore the main campaign, where dante's own just charged attacks can open up new cinematic boss fight sequences (most notably, the just charged osiris attack does a cinematic counter on the hunter's claw shot that leaves it wide open.)  as a plot it's basically social commentary being turned into something for this new dante to hit.  the canon in this game is its own thing, and this is a good thing because it gives the devs an excuse to ""casualize"" the combat in terms of frames and difficulty, since DmC is a spinoff (using the word reboot isn't quite the best description) and in its own subseries, i feel that it can get away with it, as it's ultimately meant to be an easier devil may cry game that serves as a tutorial for the advanced devil may cry combat mechanics.  and no, nero from dmc4 is not a tutorial character, he's broken. quit using that excuse, if he was a tutorial character, we'd be able to JC easier with him and there would literally be a bunch of tutorials associated with him, making a game easier doesn't make it a tutorial, DmC doesn't just make it easier, it also INFORMS the player at every opportunity while making exploration of these mechanics easier.  and that's my opinion, DmC is basically ""tutorial may cry"" a fun playground to mess with the basis of devil may cry combat turned into its own sub-series and nothing more. it even has a training mode."
DevilMayCry,30yb7g,TBAAAGamer1,4,Wed Apr 1 00:51:53 2015 UTC,"I'm 16. Brazil. I like his overall design, but his personality is... Wrong. Just wrong.  It's a 7 year old vision of ""cool."" Those jokes? I think we can agree that everyone had that ""cringe"" moment with his jokes. ""That is just a big fat joke"", ""I like it rough."" and let's not even talk about the delightful dialog with Succubus.  Halfway trough the game, when he's all worried about Kat and stuff, he changes. He gets less stupid. HOWEVER, he simply turns into something that is 100% not-Dante. I mean, at least when he was a 7-year old vision of cool, it felt like he was just a poorly made Dante.  That said, i'd like to point out that i loved Vergil on the reboot, he actually felt like another version of Vergil, one that gets driven mad by power - and loses his honor. An alternate universe in which he does not cares about honor. Of course, the original Vergil is still way better, but it felt really good to see how DmC's Vergil's personality developed."
DevilMayCry,30yb7g,xirog,4,Tue Mar 31 19:12:25 2015 UTC,"25, Indiana and DmC Dante is terrible.  Its like NT tried way too hard to make him seem like the stereotypical "" cool and rebellious "" teenager who doesn't give a shit about anything.  Nothing about him is cool or likeable. Hes an insufferable douchebag.  OG Dante is cool because he just does what he does. He doesn't try to be cool, he toys with his opponents because he is 100% certain that they won't win when it comes down to it. The only time hes ever seen being absolutely serious is when he fights Vergil or Mundus.   Hes goofy and at least puts in a little effort to avoid a confrontation when at all possible. Hes having fun the entire time in DMC4.  DmC Dante acts like his enemies are a joke. DMC4 Dante knows his enemies are a joke.  Lastly, DmC Dante looks terrible. I don't like his aesthetics at all."

DevilMayCry,30yb7g,IpHobo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:42:36 2015 UTC,"22, UK. I mean he isn't the best looking character but his dress sense is more grounded in reality, it seems like something a person his age would wear. I can't say I dislike it and since old Dante still exists, I'm okay with the reboot.  He sort of comes across as a dressed-down Nero, they could've made this Nero and I actually would've liked it a lot more.  Hopefully if they also continue with DmC, they rework some of his features. UE3 was a mistake, kinda makes his face look stupid at times.   Personality-wise, again he comes across as Nero-ish, slightly angsty. The edginess also needs to go, I guess he could mature by the time of a potential DmC 2. I'd love to see a calm, confident DmC Dante eventually that actually resembles the older version.  Vergil - looks uncool, sounds uncool. Comes nowhere near original Vergil but post-game seems like he potentially could become more like the old version."

What sold me was the ending: Seemed like it set up an interesting story (which iirc was told backwards in the original series?) Also his hair color change sort of excused that he had black hair in the beginning - since he is only growing into the Dante you (more or less) already know  I just like that someone took the core of dmc and made his thing with it (would like that with the new metal gear game konami is making, too, btw)"

DMC was a blend of DMC3 and DMC4 but didn't quite get it right.  Its still a very fun game.    The backlash over his appearance and judging the game without playing it was really stupid.

DevilMayCry,30wyb1,Warsc2k,4,Tue Mar 31 11:37:14 2015 UTC,"4 's story went all over the place.  I even believe Mundus was supposed to be there at one point.  As For Vergil, end of DMC1 he seems to fade from reality.  He already tried to take his revenge on Mundus but failed and became his servant.  4 seems to introduce his overbearing spirit (Neros DT seems to be an apparition of him) but never really concretely states even his existence.  I think Dante only knows that the Yamato was his.  The novel says that Vergil got drunk one night and impregnated a prostitute at our near Fortuna but that's as close as anything relating the two."
DevilMayCry,30wyb1,Chaotix247,3,Tue Mar 31 12:45:17 2015 UTC,"But 4SE is a prequel, meaning it happened before 4.  Also, the novel isn't canon and Nero's DT isn't an apparition of Vergil. There are a lot of elements that are extremely different. Check the artbook (or Vash's video on the matter)."

DevilMayCry,30wcue,mastersword130,6,Tue Mar 31 06:24:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Not only is sparda's line hated, but being half human is a straight up disadvantage, so he's an easy target. Or he should be. Nobody (in game,  except for dante) knows why he's so much more powerful than he should be, and the ones who challenge him likely just don't believe the stories about him.   Or hell, maybe they do and just don't care? Berial was defeated by someone with human blood twice in one day, retreating in shame the first time. Maybe his pride just couldn't handle living to fight another day in these circumstances, so he chose to die fighting instead?"
DevilMayCry,30wcue,kampasta,2,Tue Mar 31 08:52:52 2015 UTC,"Yea but he has to know that he stood absolutely no chance against someone of Dante's caliber.   The 2nd part of the Berial scene when Dante kills him fits in perfectly, but man. You'd figure that Demons would know not to fuck with Dante ( or anyone of Sparda's blood for that matter ) unless you're some universally known badass of the demon world by this point in time.  Also, isn't it established that Dante is now stronger than Sparda was? Or was that just a word of mouth type thing?"
DevilMayCry,30wcue,RageVG,6,Tue Mar 31 06:29:54 2015 UTC,"Pride. Simple as that. ""I have retreated once, I will not back down again"" were his words, I believe. He knew he couldn't win. It's just he'd prefer to die fighting than live running."
DevilMayCry,30wcue,mastersword130,3,Tue Mar 31 16:35:00 2015 UTC,Over confidence and lead you into deep shit. Lore wise Dante is stronger than sparda but even in the anime it seems not every demon knows who Dante is and the ones who do know he is the son of sparda always want to fight him to prove themselves or to open some fucked up gate.  Think of it like those drunk short dudes in bars picking a fight with the bouncers. Everyone knows they're going to get their ass kicked but because they're drunk they become over confident and try to pick a fight with the biggest person there.  Even Belial was spouting some bull before fighting Dante about who he is and how he is a lord in hell.
DevilMayCry,30wcue,Dreceratops,4,Tue Mar 31 06:34:25 2015 UTC,"Making Dante fight all of Nero's bosses was probably more a time constraint than anything. I'm doubting they had time to make or implement his own bosses so Capcom just made him fight Nero's and recorded new lines and footage. I've heard that in DMC 4, Dante was going to venture into Hell and find Vergil or something. Judging by the name of his weapons, he was going to fight Demons called Pandora and Gilgamesh, and eventually Lucifer himself. If they were fought in Hell, they were probably Demon generals or bigshots or something."
DevilMayCry,30wcue,TBAAAGamer1,6,Tue Mar 31 06:44:53 2015 UTC,"I've heard that theory as well ( save for the Vergil part ), that DMC4 as it is isn't even half of what was originally intended. I wish Capcom would have given the team a larger budget to work with and not rushed it out of the door."
DevilMayCry,30wcue,ConradBHart42,3,Tue Mar 31 06:51:23 2015 UTC,"Well, berial is a warrior and a demon. these two mixed tend to equate to ""battle to the death for honor and glory!"" I guess his warrior's sensibilities couldn't overlook so powerful an opponent, sure he knew he'd die, but he couldn't be sure until he fought dante. TL;DR Some People just want to fight a stronger opponent for the pleasure of battle."
DevilMayCry,30wcue,HASJ,3,Tue Mar 31 17:45:41 2015 UTC,"It's implied that The Order defeated Vergil somehow, because otherwise how would they have Yamato?  Maybe I'm missing something about that.  Sanctus/The Order's hubris is perfectly reasonable because they believed they had the same power that Dante had (through Yamato and their artificial angels), but also they were sacrificing all of Fortuna to empower the savior, which they would then ride into Hell to wipe out the demons at the source.  That was their plan.  They either didn't expect Dante to care, or didn't expect him to be any sort of challenge for the Savior, or both.  They may have written him off as a myth.    As for Berial, it's already been pointed out that there were all kinds of reasons he could have believed he stood a chance against Dante.  It could have just been that Berial didn't think Dante would let him flee anyway.  Could be someone was giving Berial orders to guard that hellgate and desertion of that duty is worse than death."

DevilMayCry,30lxm7,HardDifficulty,11,Sat Mar 28 16:09:56 2015 UTC,"For those that don't want to sit through the whole thing:  Vergil's ""focus bar"" charges if you're in proximity to an enemy (Faster for more enemies) and not moving.  It also charges on attacks that hit, and dumps if your attack misses.  As the bar charges, you get access to more and more powerful moves, such as the huge screen clearing attack that vergil uses at the end of the trailer.  I guess this will reward players for playing vergil how he tends to be seen fighting in cutscenes.  Vergil also has DmC vergil's ability to embed a sword in an enemy and teleport to them.  Lady and Trish trade off the game the way Dante and Nero do, with Lady taking nero's stages, and trish taking the rest, mostly because lady has a grapple gun that functions ""comparably, but not the same"" to nero's devil bringer.  Vergil can clear all levels on his own.  Later they touch on the whole ""DmC vs DMC"" thing,  and go on to make the comparison to how games like megaman are ""kings of reinventing themselves"" and how games like classic megaman, and other games like legends and battle network are totally different than each other, but still acknowledged as part of the series  Edit - also around 32 minutes in, ""we want to stress that the existence of one thing doesn't mean we're ignoring the other!"" capcom is acknowledging that DMC and DmC are two different series, and both will get love"
DevilMayCry,30lxm7,kampasta,4,Sun Mar 29 00:47:54 2015 UTC,Just give DmC a completely.different name and we're good.
DevilMayCry,30lxm7,flawless_flores,1 point,Sun Mar 29 04:57:40 2015 UTC,"DmC wouldn't have existed in the first place if it weren't a Devil May Cry title, and as Gregaman mentions in this very podcast, DmC is far more similar to the original DMC series than people like to admit (somewhere around that 'same elevator pitch' part).  DmC would have to be altered beyond recognition to not be a Devil May Cry game. If it had a different name and slight changes to the characters and weapons, it would still be the most blatantly obvious ripoff of another title in videogame history.  So yeah, sorry, but I don't quite buy this, and it's probably the oldest argument I've been hearing since 2010 about this game. Haha, I just hope no one sees me as someone 'crawling out of the woodwork to fight over it' just because I disagree with the assumption that it would be so easy to detach DmC from the franchise. Just because some people want it to be that easy doesn't make it so."
DevilMayCry,30lxm7,scionicspectre,0,Sun Mar 29 09:53:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you meant the writing and thematic elements. I was talking about the gameplay. Nothing says Devil May Cry like smacking an enemy into the air with a double-edged sword and using twin pistols to keep them up there. Not to mention all of the other minute ways the weapons work that are nearly identical (stinger, million stab, drive, using a shotgun blast to prop yourself up, etc.).  So far as the tone of the storytelling and visuals go, I certainly agree with you that you could easily branch that off under a different franchise. Even games like Final Fantasy and Metal Gear Solid are closer to DMC in that regard.  The gameplay, however, is so similar in ways that even the next most similar games (Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising) can't touch. The gameplay would have to be changed beyond recognition to avoid a direct comparison."
DevilMayCry,30lxm7,scionicspectre,0,Mon Mar 30 06:54:54 2015 UTC,"Bayonetta is probably the closest, but that's understandable for obvious reasons (Kamiya can't really rip himself off). I guess this may simply be due to my being less familiar with the genre than I expected, as I haven't taken the time to play Red Steel. Even still, I'd say DmC is more similar to Devil May Cry than Bayonetta or Red Steel from what I've read, which is my point. Its gameplay is more similar than anything else out there from what I can tell.  All I'm saying is that the game is made to play mostly like a Devil May Cry game and it shows. If you revised it to be closer to something like Heavenly Sword or God of War, it would require about half of the gameplay to be changed. Even when you change the weapons and gameplay enough to make it distinguishable, you'd need to put in additional work to make the enemies and levels work around that design.  So yeah, you could take DmC and change it enough to be a convincingly original title with enough work, but it would be a lot more work than people around the web seem to acknowledge. And for what reason? I guess that's the main issue I have with this whole concept, since the only reason I can think of is that people don't want DmC to 'taint' the franchise. I don't think that's a useful mindset at this point (I didn't think it was very productive in 2010, either).  At any rate, Ninja Theory wasn't going to make a game like DmC without Capcom asking them to make a new Devil May Cry, so the whole idea of them branding it as something else seems odd to begin with. It really does seem that very few people discuss this idea without some kind of emotional motivation."
DevilMayCry,30lxm7,scionicspectre,1 point,Mon Mar 30 09:44:47 2015 UTC,"Rebellion's moveset, as I mentioned earlier, which has nearly identical inputs aside from the launcher button, of course. Osiris and Eryx also have a few recycled moves, although Aquila's version of round-trip is definitely different. Of course, many games have moves with similar uses, so we probably wouldn't have to throw too much out. I mean, the scythe and the axe wouldn't really need much reworking aside from maybe prop shredder.  Other than that, fireworks and rainstorm are quite obviously the exact same move as well. I guess the question is how many of these exact copies of moves we could get away with keeping. When you're done with all of that, you have to rebalance the game's enemies and bosses in particular to accommodate it. That is, if you want to do a good job.  But yeah, I agree with you on the aerial combat side- it's an extension of Nero's mechanics, and not something common to the series at all. Not to mention you have angel glide, so there are opportunities there to make some changes.  Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, the game could have branched out a bit more if it weren't a DMC game since there wouldn't have been as much pressure to make it similar. Even still, that only reinforces the fact that it feels so similar. DmC is essentially DMC if you could play around in the air a bit more. That is, with its own smaller variations with stances instead of weapon switching and auto lock-on, but I'd argue that's not as impactful as having much of the same moveset as classic Dante. The control scheme doesn't have as much impact as the actual things you can do.  Aside from a small selection of hack'n'slashes which we've already mentioned, I can't think of many games that have so much similarity to DMC's combat mechanics. I suppose that, for some, it's different enough to belong to a different series. I do find it amusing how it's been lauded for its originality when so much of it relies on Dante and Nero's existing gameplay.  Anyway, sorry for the drawn out replies, especially since this is off-topic. I'll try to be more concise next time. I do grant that you have a point, and I'm beginning to see how DmC could have transitioned into an independent series. Either way, I'm glad we got the game we did, and that we're getting a return to the most complex and deep game in the series (IMHO), DMC 4."
DevilMayCry,30lxm7,scionicspectre,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:59:24 2015 UTC,"DmC wouldn't have existed in the first place if it weren't a Devil May Cry title   You are hilariously right. Take DMC3 or 4, pitch it as a new title with new characters, and people will still play it, because it's still good and doesn't need to rely on sequel legacy to excuse its flaws. The same people behind inventing this series did exactly that with bayonetta, a game that sold amazingly well as a brand new ip, totally unrelated to dmc despite taking a whole lot of inspiration from it. How about ninja theory's attempt to do the same? Well, heavenly sword 2 was canceled for lack of interest, so you do the math. If this game wasn't called devil may cry, nobody would have cared. Oh look, a new brawler featuring heavenly sword's dual stance system, art style, writing, and treatment of boss fights as excuses for cutscenes? Wasn't the sequel to heavenly sword binned before it even left the gates for being shit? Oh wait, no, this game says ""devil may cry"" on the box, so let's buy it and then argue over its merits for the next 5 years  If ninja theory hadn't named the game dmc, nobody would have cared, and it would not exist. In this sense you are right.    So yeah, sorry, but I don't quite buy this, and it's probably the oldest argument I've been hearing since 2010 about this game. Haha, I just hope no one sees me as someone 'crawling out of the woodwork to fight over it' just because I disagree with the assumption that it would be so easy to detach DmC from the franchise. Just because some people want it to be that easy doesn't make it so.   If you hope people don't see you that way, why are you that way? It would be incredibly easy to detach DmC from the franchise: rename all the characters, call the game heavenly sword 2. Done, that was easy!"
DevilMayCry,30lxm7,PM_ME_STAB_WOUNDS,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"Hm, well the discussion has gone on a lot further than this point and I've already conceded a few things and gotten into a more nuanced argument with kampasta. Since I don't want you to have to read through all of that, though, I'll just say that I enjoyed DmC and I think it would do well on its own merits. I also think it takes a lot more than the stance system to make a game be like Heavenly Sword, but that's probably not what you're trying to say.  While I did enjoy DmC (played the hell out of it when it came out), I've still enjoyed myself far more with the original series, and I've played both 3 and 4 twice as much as DmC on an individual basis. So I'm not trying to defend DmC in opposition to anything in the main series- I love the original series and I've been playing since 2001. If it weren't for DMC, I don't think I'd really be much into gaming anymore.  So really, I'm not trying to pick a fight over it. I'm just trying to represent an honest viewpoint that seems to be the minority on this subreddit."

Dark slayer couldn't teleport you straight to an enemy that was too far from you (best you could do was blink up, neutral blink, to cover long distances) so if I could nail someone with a sword at 50 yards, deal with a small cluster, and then just appear next to that dude at my leisure, that would be pretty cool.  DmC did a lot of things wrong, but it also did plenty of things right, and even if it were as bad as some of the more vocal detractors claim (I don't think it is) useful information can be taken from even the worst game in the world"

DevilMayCry,30kn72,Walican132,2,Sat Mar 28 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"Ok, people are giving incorrect information for DMC1. These comments about using varied moves do not apply at all to DMC1. That is true starting in DMC3, but the style meter in DMC1 and DMC3 are completely different.  In DMC1, your Style meter will always go up as long as you keep attacking. When one attack lands, you have 1.5 seconds to have another attack hit, or else you lose your Style meter completely. As long as you keep attacking, your style meter will always go up. Moves like taunting, charging a round trip, and charging Ifrit moves will help you delay the delay the style meter from resetting, but it does not increase your style meter. In reality, for DMC1, you can ignore the style meter. It does not affect rank that you receive at the end of each mission, which it does starting in DMC2."
DevilMayCry,30kn72,bassomegax,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I've been having so much fun and i'm clearly getting better at the game, a few A and S rank combos aren't nearly as rare.  Once I figured out timing effected your Sword combos I was really impressed.  I don't really understand the use for ifirit (or what ever the punchy one is) though it doesn't seem to have more than its basic combo.    So DMC 2/3 play differently?"
DevilMayCry,30kn72,devil_put_www_here,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:59:26 2015 UTC,"Ifirit's base combo is punch, punch, kick, kick.  You can build a better combo by doing punch, punch, uppercut, backflip, jump kick.  You need to have the ability that turns your jumps into flaming attacks to do the backflip kick as well as the uppercut ability (back+attack).  Use Kick 13 like you would the Stinger to close distance and push enemies away from you and isolate a target.  Only charge an attack when you take an enemy's back, stun them, or score a knockdown.  If you get good you can time charged attacks so they land when an enemy walks into range.  You'll be doing a lot of jumping with Ifirit because while it deals very little damage it can interrupt enemy attack animations.  The Death Scythe gets absolutely brutalized by this weapon, and you'll need to to contend with the Frost's at higher difficulties.  Ifirit is a boss killer and great at dealing with a single enemy at a time.  Inferno is your ""oh shit"" move replacing Air Raid when you fill your DT gauge and need to maximize the amount of damage in a short amount of time with a solid AOE.  Obviously don't use this weapon on Phantoom.  It's the ideal weapon against Nightmare (inferno spam), Griffon (open to meteor) and Nelo Angel (easy to stun lock and break through his sword parrying).  And everything I said applies to DMC4's counter part :)"
DevilMayCry,30kn72,bassomegax,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:27:25 2015 UTC,Sweet thanks!  I'll definitely invest some orbs to ifirit next time I play.
DevilMayCry,30kn72,bassomegax,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"Ifrit is a weapon that is better when you know the situations to use it, as well as investing in moves. This is because Ifrit by default comes with very little, but is an incredibly powerful weapon once you learn how to use it.   I also don't recommend Inferno spam, especially against Nightmare. It works on lower difficulties, but it's really not that efficient. Regular combos and Meteors are better for Nightmare.  However, once you learn how to use Ifrit, you can learn to use it against Phantom. Ifrit is probably a better weapon against Phantom than Alastor(unless you know how to critical hit, but that's an advanced technique)."

DevilMayCry,30kn72,nebul0us,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:02:01 2015 UTC,"Ninja edit. Just realized you meant the game bundle, not the reboot.   Best way to rank up your style points is variation. Keep in mind the more times you do something in a row, the fewer points you'll receive for it.   So if you're shooting, try a different shot, launch an enemy. Air rave. Then go back to shooting. Or do some melee attacks with Rebellion or whatever you have in your arsenal (don't wanna spoil it). Then shoot some more. Launch and shoot. Switch up your weapons, switch up your attacks and you'll do fine. I've gotten to SS dozens of times and I don't fancy myself to be a really good player or anything. But I've also played every iteration. so I'm used to it. You'll get there."

Of course, it's not impossible to come to grips with it from a fresh perspective, but the amount of styles and replayability in DMC 3: SE, coupled with the fact that it tells the classic tale of Vergil and Dante's 'awakening' makes it essential in my opinion. The graphics and campiness may not be up to your expectations after playing DmC, but I'd say it's a worthy investment while you wait for June."

I also beat 1,3 and 4 on DMD/VMD mode. I don't disagree that DMC3 was the best and very special, however I had way more fun with the reboot than with any previous DMC.   I just feel like fanboys are butthurt because of the cosmetic changes to Dante. The weapons are amazing in the game and what u can do with combos really altered DMC as a whole. I think people got stuck in their egos and couldn't appreciate the new Dante which IMO is most similar to DMC 3 Dante. And people arguing about the story must have not played 1,2, and 4 and saw the convoluted mess that became.   The new DMC at least makes sense, is easy to follow, and I like the whole angel/demon thing. If they were able to fix things up that much in 1 reboot I could only imagine how much better the story and game can become over time. I don't think capcom  will release a sequel to the reboot tho because people never tried it or gave the reboot a chance. DMC1 was amazing when I first played it and DMC 3 just brought it all together. However, the new DMC is ridiculously satisfying full of hack and slash action, gore, and great weapons especially on DMD or Hell or Hell mode. (I feel like Ninja Gaiden 2 is the only game that can compare to it).  I can't recall any game out right now for the current gen(xbone/ps4, wii u doesn't count even though bayo 2 is really good) that has this type of action.

The one time he did he noted how much he regretted putting up something so pointless (but it is what his fans asked for).

DevilMayCry,307v7l,AjscoS4,5,Wed Mar 25 04:14:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, what I didn't like about DMC: Devil May Cry was how the game took itself so seriously. It's lacking the over-the-top cutscenes that make the characters pre-reboot memorable and even more enjoyable to play as. Why would you prefer a character who is serious and moody when you can play as someone who manages to make light of the situation while still understanding the gravity of their actions? (Obligatory Lucifer Cutscene)"
DevilMayCry,307v7l,ShadowdawnXIII,5,Wed Mar 25 05:39:16 2015 UTC,"The story was meh. It wasn't offensively bad, it wasn't that good, just meh. Dante isn't as bad as the FUCK YOU scene would have you believe, and he eventually grows on you. Still not the old Dante, but he becomes an alright dude. But even if the story had all the same characters and actors from the previous games and they managed to make an enjoyable story on par with or better than the rest, it would still be a bad DMC game.   Ninja Theory took what they knew, the Heavenly Sword stance system, and just stuck it in DMC inspired combat. Or, they they had a stance system, butchered the DMC combat system, and had Hideaki Itsuno salvage it months before release, I'm not quite sure, that's just an amalgamation of everything I've heard. Anyways, they base the whole combat system on two stances on opposite sides of the controller, L2 and R2. This specific set-up for the stance system, because if both stances were L1 and L2, it might be salvageable, is probably the root cause for DmC's combat being as disappointing as it is.   Because of the awkwardness of having to alternate between two triggers, they decided that having to hold down two shoulder buttons at once, like R1 and R2, would feel a bit awkward, and they were kinda right. For that reason, they added two dodge buttons. But with all 4 shoulder buttons occupied, there was no room for lock-on, which was integral to DMC's move variety and combat depth.   Lock-on allowed for 3 or even 4 inputs for one button, never minding pause-combos. With the removal of lock-on, lock-on+forwards was replaced with forwards+forwards, which even after beating DmD still feels finicky as hell. Neutral input remained the same, but things like Nero's buster and Dante's Air Trick actually changed depending on if you were locked on or not. Lock-on+backwards was replaced by it's own special melee button, the button that was previously reserved for styles. Don't forget, the style button also had different lock-on inputs. DmC takes the function of lock-on+ 1 button and requires the player to use 2 buttons.   Lock-on also helped with being able to see what enemy you were targeting, which sometimes made closely grouped enemies or enemies in the air hard to deal with. In DmC's defense, they added the lockon+health indicator along with classic stinger inputs to Definitive Edition. But only the stinger input. When DmC: DE was announced, there were a few who hoped that they'd finally get rid of special melee and that DmC could finally stand up to it's older brothers, but that never happened.   DMC 4 is insanely efficient with it's controller setup, and Nero also marked the addition of forwards+backwards inputs. DmC on the other hand, has 2 dodge buttons, 2 melee switch buttons, an unbound d-pad down, and a special melee button that doesn't even get it's own stinger input. DMC thrives on move variety, and with DmC's waste of controller real-estate, it lacks the depth and variety of it's predecessors. Yes, we've all seen Happy Birthday DmC, but that just serves my point even better. If lock-on existed and special melee became something like swordmaster, you'd essentially double the amount of melee moves and DmC's combat would be hype as fuck.  tl;dr: DmC is an alright game but a bad DMC game because the lack of lock-on killed the combat's depth."

I still think it was a bitch move from Ninja theory because if they have stayed with their original DmC  as they stated their game was ""way too good"" then it would have been let's say ''okay' but now they go and add all the things that made the lasts DMC's so good so now they release a game that should've had all those things on release!!. They add all the stuff and sell it as a new game for me it's a total bitch move at least. They released an unfinished game so now they can add all the things THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST PLACE to earn more money. Didn't they said their game was so good? Then why add to it stuff from DMC.   DmC it's so easy to everything.   Getting SSS is lame and easy Color coded enemies was just god... Don't even get me started on the lousy script, '' Fuck you fuck you fuck you'' Jump canceling is too easy. With Vergil you can just JC and press B and win. Add to that the Doppelganger and SSS Old Dante is a cool guy, he is badass! I mean even in the Anime series he is a little more serious which is great but still kicks ass, you can quickly now that he is a fucking demon and will beat the shit out of you BUT he is just funny and has fun. Now this new Donte is like a child whenever his Mom bitch him. I personally also think that the fucker from Ninja theory just wanted to be in the game, just look for yourself. It ain't bad to be in a game, it's like everyone's dream but this way? It's bs. Fighting bosses... Easy as eating cake. I used to rage a lot in DMC 3-4. I still do. Why the hell make fun of hair when your haircut is ten times worse... The only thing i really liked it was this mod. Heck it was hilarious. THE MUSIC IS JUST BS DUBSTEP OR WHATEVER. DMC3 Just makes you feel like smash those fuckers and encourages you to it!. Stinger... Remember? Lock on, Forward+ Melee. Done! In DmC... Gotta press back then forward to see if you can hit something.   I regret so much hating Nero. I remember when DMC 4 came out and i really didn't like Nero at all but thanks to DmC I love him now.

New Dante's hair is one of the new takes on the old-school haircut that is now commonly referred to as the Hitler Youth Cut. While this is largely subjective, New Dante has that cut for a reason. It's a popular style in modern day.   the music is just bs dubstep or whatever   The music in all levels except the club and a few cutscenes was aggrotech, which is basically ""screamo"" sounding music, similar to 3 and 4 to some extent, but then blended with an electronic sound. To be fair to the game, it had a MUCH better soundtrack than 4. I enjoyed the variety rather than hearing ""The Time Has Come"" in every fight that wasn't a boss fight for 11 chapters straight.

THe true reason DmC. was so harshly critizised is that a lot of diehard fans were butthurt that the franchise got rebooted.  Fanboys dont like change, and DmC. presents a rebellious teen Dante with SHORT and BLACK hair. That right there is a recipe for disaster. I knew from the moment I saw the first trailer that it didnt matter at all if the game was bad or a masterpiece, everyone would jump on fanboy hate train and it would be remembered as as the worst Devil May Cry game. When I played it and saw that they changed the combat system EVER SO SLIGHTLY I resigned and eccepted that everyone would consider it a bad game, becouse it changed.  The reality is that DmC. is an awesome game. Of course Its not the best of the frachise but gameplay and plotwise is at least at DMC4 level. ¿Wanna hate a DMC game? Hate DMC2. That game truly sucked.  TL;DR: people hate DmC. becouse dante was different from the previous devil may crys. All the gameplay gibberish is just a scapegoat for people not liking reboots of their favourite franchises."

I understand you (and MANY other people) liked the game, hell, I won't even try to say the game is crap, but the problems are there.  The changes themselves were the problem not the fact that there were changes. To say that the gameplay was changed ""ever so slightly"" is just plain wrong. Now I know that there are people who didn't bother getting deep into the combat of the previous games because I admit it is a chore unless you just enjoy it enough to keep going, and I know that those people most certainly wouldn't notice too much different in the combat but take it from someone who has spent thousands of hours on the originals and hundreds of hours on the reboot, the combat was changed too drastically.  Basically what it comes down to is what you've most likely already heard a million times... Most of us don't think it's a bad game, but it's a bad Devil May Cry game (still better than 2 though). If Ninja Theory made it their own IP it would have been praised as a reasonable entry into that DMC stylised action genre.  But to make my final point... I've never really understood why people would actually take it so to heart, I mean, the DMC games I love are still there and have in no way been made worse by the existence of the reboot so guess what? I play those instead... It's that simple."
DevilMayCry,307v7l,ThnderDwnUndr,0,Fri Mar 27 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"I really liked the game's story as well as Dante and his character arc going from foul-mouthed, apathetic, self-centered hedonist to a more mature man with beliefs and convictions, as well as finally having emotional attachments to other people.  The first half is a great hero's journey tale developing Dante's belief system, and the second is a deconstruction of the hero's motivations that include morality and the nature of revenge.  I loved the combat as it made everything so seamless and easy to switch between the different styles.  The enemies were incredible in terms of gameplay implementation and design and the weapons were all unique and I found myself using ALL of them in game (rather than my usual MO of just finding the dominant strategy weapon and leaving all the sub-weapons to rot since they weren't as useful, even in hack-n-slash games I love like Metal Gear Rising Revengeance or God of War).  Although some had valid points of contention with the new Devil May Cry, it was a well-made game that I feel got way too harshly criticized."

No? ok then how about a new young character with no real relevance to anything? hmmm...Yeah sounds great!

IT WAS GREAT! The first trailers were awful however the end product was great. People whinged and whined about the whole FUCK YOU line but it was good joke. Pretty much sums up all the youth and the attitude of a street rat who has no problem fucking over people he doesn't trust. Dante is a street rat, if you met him on the street you would not get along with him. Thats the point! people fell in love with Dante from DMC 4 (don't blame them he was a cool old guy) but he was never that polite or approachable in the comics or in early games.  The story was great! They explored some lore, a little but it was great.  * We met  Phineas an old ally of their fathers (their asshole of a Dad had allies!) * We found out about an ancient Nephilim army * We found out that the Flood of Noah (Nephilim genocide) in this game does in fact accurately allude to the mass genocide of the Nephilim by God? The one time Angels and Demons worked toward a common thing, wiping out the Nephilim army that once fought against and eventually with Sparda at some stage of his life . * We found out more about angels - Not much but some indicators as to their character- We know they didn't approve of Eva's decisions, they showed this by letting her die and witnessing her death whilst doing nothing. They are sticklers for the rules, they didn't help as they did not approve of her actions. They are private, hidden and do nothing most of the time. (pretty much a popular depiction of angels in popular culture ie. Supernatural.)  Character. Vergil the fit. neck-beardless, pasty, svelte sociopath of a neck-beard brother who despite getting everything had a void to fill. With a fedora and an anonymous mask. ok. That was funny. But his character was great. Cute even.  Kat. The characteristically inconsistent TV psychic with a predisposition for scoliosis and a preference for inauthentic Henna hand tats. ok. She had her good moments. She was smart I liked that, she was dependant, I understand that. I'm glad there was no love interest in this game. SO GLAD. The comic however, I did not see why Vergil had to get with her.   The aesthetic of the game was great. really great. Sound track was excellent. Its a good game and old albino wannabe fanfags really missed out by dissing it. Their loss. I hope there is another game of DMC.   Sadly enough (no in store limited edition merch 4 me)yet on another note lucky. I live in Australia, Tim Phillips who starred as Dante is on 'Neighbours' a shitty soap opera SUPER SHITTY CAN'T BEAR TO WATCH, BUT HAVE TO SO I CAN MONITOR HIM, so I pray thee that he dies soon! His contract is cancelled and that he does another game. His acting was great. TIM PHILLIP$ , 4 REELZ BOI, DIE ON DE NAEBORS ALREDDY!!! gosh darnit!  DmC was great! Anyone who disagrees can watch Neighbours. ITS AWFUL AND SO ARE YOU!"

Fans of both Dmc and DMC have gotten what they wanted out of their respective games. 60fps and tougher gameplay for the former, and the features we wanted from the latter. I expect Lady/Trish and Vergil to be treated roughly like Vergil was in DMC3:SE...which means that there may be still the ton of backtracking. At least there's more than an opening cutscene now.  I just need Daniel South Vergil in my life. I think Ultimate MVC3's the reason he's here now. I hope his DT from that looks as cool here."

I am happy with Trish and Lady. I'm really curious about Vergil. Can't wait."
DevilMayCry,302btx,Dreceratops,6,Mon Mar 23 22:19:53 2015 UTC,"It looks to me like they took DMC3 Vergil as a base and then added in some of Vorgil's moves from Downfall.  Watch this video and you can see that the Aerial Rave performed in the trailer is the same exact one Vorgil does in downfall.  The spinning move Vergil performs with Yamato is called Orbit, also one of Vorgil's moves.  I'd imagine Orbit is performed in the same exact manner as Nero's Roulette. As far as Aerial Lunar Phase, I'd bet its the same way Nero's Split works. Lock on + forward + melee whereas just pressing melee would make him do Starfall.  Lastly, if you look at that Force Edge and Vergil's arm while hes using it, you can see that the sword itself is shadowy and his arm is glowing. So it probably works like Yamato does for Nero's DT where it appears in Nero's hand for the move, and then disappears afterward. It probably works like DMC3 where you select Yamato+Force Edge as a weapon which is why Yamato has its own launching move aka Upper Slash."
DevilMayCry,302btx,KevinLee487,2,Tue Mar 24 06:02:10 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming Roulette is the first 2 hits of his new Rave, pause, Roulette. So yeah, just like Nero's.  Well, Orbit was just a less satisfying version of Lunar Phase done in the air, so I guess we've come full circle. As a name, Orbit fits Vergil's theming better than Roulette, but DmC's Orbit was a spin with a spike at the end while this is a launcher with a height gain.  Yeah, when Vergil used Force Edge, it used some sort of dark cloud/aura thing, which I thought was strange. I thought the after-image/phantom effect was an issue with the video, but it doesn't appear anywhere else, so it might just be part of using Force Edge."

DevilMayCry,303ls0,KevinLee487,8,Tue Mar 24 04:42:36 2015 UTC,"This already happened OP. They released the HD collection a few days or months before DmC was released. Guess which still outsold which?   Capcom already knows DmC is a failure hence why they fired Ninja Theory. This is just capcom double dipping with DmC and ""fixing"" it to say ""hey, the game isn't all that bad"".  In all seriousness though DmC4 SE is going to outsell DmC. It has much more to offer."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,mastersword130,5,Tue Mar 24 05:35:53 2015 UTC,"If the HD Collection came out BEFORE DmC, I don't think that quite counts.  I'd also have to say no lock-on really hurt DmC's sales as it was one the major complaints I saw that kept cropping up along with the game running at 30fps. Completely ruining the established characters damn sure didn't help though.  Now that DmC is ""fixed"" they're releasing a better DMC4 to really see where the fanbase lies.  Now granted, I know DmC was a complete flop and I'm glad for that, I just think that Capcom wants to be 100% sure that we don't want Donte and Vorgil before they either axe the entire series, or make DMC5. Thats just my theory anyway."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,mastersword130,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:42:35 2015 UTC,"The HD collection was meant to bring new fans in and to promote the new game. What they got was outselling HD collection and shitty sells for the polished turd.  Lock on did hurt and so did the 30 frame rate but the biggest issue was the stances, interrupting cut scenes (especially during boss battles), one awful story and god awful dialog and pushing female characters back 10 years.  They went from a kickass demon slayer with guns and a demonic demob slayer that takes the form of Dante's dead mom to a walking nav guide Kat and a walking incubator Lilith.   Game was alright, not great but it definitely sucked as a devil may cry game. I don't see it as an experiment but trying to double dip and hopefully redeem themselves with the fixed version which I'm sure it isn't going to happen. Too little too late."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,CH_GOROG,3,Tue Mar 24 05:48:20 2015 UTC,"I thought the combat was excellent.  I didn't notice the 30 fps, especially with the outstanding presentation they had with the game.  I liked the story with the thematic content they gave to Dante for his character arc.  Kat pushing back female characters 10 years?  I disagree.  I thought she was terrifically written, but to each their own.  I like all the new additions to the Definitive collection and I hope that Ninja Theory gets an opportunity to make a sequel."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,mastersword130,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:38:30 2015 UTC,"Really? You though Kat was great? The nav guide who was abused by her demonic step father and only use is for her to make you portals? Okay, to each his own but she contributed zero to the story, she could have been easily removed and replaced by a robot and nothing would have changed. She was forced into the game as a love interest which was bad.  Also NT isn't having another chance of making a sequel, they were fired for a reason.  The combat was bad, it was like heavenly sword without the good story. Once I can juggle an enemy in the air for 30 mins without stopping you know you made bad combat and tied the ranking to damage instead of combos which kills the whole DMC flavor of stringing up moves."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,CH_GOROG,4,Wed Mar 25 13:22:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do think she's great.  She's an multi-layered character who's very well written.  She's the one who can pull Dante and Vergil through Limbo, make enemies vulnerable to attack (in the case of the Hunter), manipulate the environment, provides intel and strategy, can get reconnaissance through Limbo, and she's the one who comes up with the planning to assault Mundus' fortress.  Her story is an incredibly important one as her foster father's abuse had led her to utilize Limbo as a  way to escape (that she now uses for reconnaissance).  Dante begins to connect with her as they both reveal that they've been attacked and abused by demons in their young lives.  It's something they finally bond over and actually gets Dante to start caring about others.  She's timid and shy, but that doesn't get in the way of her beliefs and dedication to her convictions, which I love rather than her just being another generic ""action chick"".  From the stand-point of story and character, I believe that the game is well-written.  3rd party developers aren't ""fired"" by publishers after they finish their contract for making a game.  Publishers finance and provide intellectual rights for developers who make the game.  In the case of Ninja Theory, they're not owned by Capcom, so unlike a game studio like 343 Industries or Naughty Dog, Ninja Theory is separate from the corporate structure of Capcom.  Capcom contracted them for making DmC, and if they want to make a sequel, they'll have to set up another contract for a new game.  You can fire individuals from a company, but you can't fire a company you've contracted to do work.  At the very worst, if Capcom decides to go with DMC5 and not Ninja Theory's sequel, then they're merely not contracted again.    Gameplay was fantastic, but agree to disagree on that, I suppose,"
DevilMayCry,303ls0,Raystacksem,2,Wed Mar 25 14:08:18 2015 UTC,"I always get annoyed by the butthurt fanboys. I played every DMC as they were released and none of them, including 3, had more action and fun combat than the the reboot. I love 3 and it will always be my favorite, but I would be lying if I said i felt the older ones were better. Ninja theory did an amazing job trying to fix a convoluted story. Some things they did right and other things wrong but if we compare dmc4 with the new DMC reboot, the reboot is better in every way and more enjoyable. I could argue about this for hours but I disagree with all the fanboys who don't allow themselves to enjoy the new DMC even though it doesn't ""feel like DMC."" (whatever that cop out excuse means)"
DevilMayCry,303ls0,mastersword130,3,Sun Mar 29 11:58:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest the only area that the older games are better is the difficulty. DmC was without a doubt overly simplified and the bosses were a joke in comparison to past titles. Other than that it was definitely a better game over all.  I always find it hilarious that people bash the story and characters when the previous games essentially had no story beyond ""Hur dur the son of Sparda, slayer of demons"" and all the characters have poorly fleshed out back stories and little to no development. They're all incredibly static to be honest with no foils for comparison which leaves you with an underwhelming cast. If it wasn't for the fact they all did bad ass moves in cut scenes they wouldn't be interesting at all."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,CH_GOROG,0,Sun Mar 29 20:20:52 2015 UTC,"Really? A great multilayered character? The one that was a forced love interest and a navguide who could easily be replaced by a robot? Her back story was crappy also which was obviously tacked on to make Dante feel for her to make him join anonymous.   And yes, NT was fired and yes they can fire a 3rd party developer and even threw NT under the bus because of the bad sales of the game. Even if they do make DmC2, which they never will, it won't be NT who will be developing the game. They don't own DmC so they don't have a say in the matter.   Kat was an abused ""witch"" who makes Dante ""feel"" and is a walking guidance system and portal maker, she is one of the worst characters I've come across right next to Lilith. At least Lady in DMC3 wanted Revenge and became a kickass hunter who didn't cry about her past nor did Dante feel for her or Trish, a demonic hitman to kill Dante and took the form of his dead mother to make him distracted.  Kat came out of the left field and made this ""none caring emo"" Dante start to care about humans and shit over his own brother who he didn't have any bad blood with until the end? Bad writing is bad writing.  Go look up demons blade and heavenly sword if you want more gameplay as DmC."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,mastersword130,2,Wed Mar 25 14:24:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think she was a forced love interest, and I don't think she could be just ""easily be replaced by a robot'.    It's obvious I'm not going to change your mind about this and I especially don't agree with your analysis of the story or characters, so I'll just leave it as agree to disagree, and that I loved DmC."

DevilMayCry,303ls0,GabeDevine,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:56:27 2015 UTC,"Because you don't need to show kissing to show romantic interest. Seriously who the hell are you? kiera in DMC4 didn't kiss Nero and yet there was a definite romance.   If Kat was to be shown as her as humanity than they did a shit job at it. She was weak, a GPS system and only was there to be the bridge to Dantes brother and limbo. Lady from DMC3 and 4 are a much better view of a strong human."

DevilMayCry,303ls0,mastersword130,2,Tue Mar 24 18:51:41 2015 UTC,"DMC 4 is remembered as a half finished game for good reason, but according to wikipedia, it got like 8's and 9's and was the best selling DMC. DMC 4 did a pretty good job binding DMC 3's tight combat styles together, considering it was rushed out.  The combat is probably the best thing from 4, considering the levels and aesthetic kinda got boring, not mentioning the whole backtracking thing.   But DMC 4 left an amazing base to build upon. If Capcom actually had the time, and they certainly had the money, DMC 5 could have built on 4's combat and had the time to polish the game to have 3's presentation. But instead of building on what they had, they mixed it all together and made the reboot. Instead of iterating on something that just needed more polish, they decided to reboot it and build from the ground up.   If Capcom realized the mistakes they made in 4 and then released Special edition when DmC was announced/came out, we might be sitting here being hype about DMC 5. Instead, the reboot happened, the backlash against the reboot happened, and the backlash against the community happened. DmC created the toxicity that exists in the community today. Just because it was an alright game doesn't mean it hasn't done damage to the community and franchise as a whole."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,GabeDevine,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"If only capcom gave the same amount of money and time for DMC4 that they gave DmC and people would have loved it even more.  Capcom got blinded by the CoD $5 million audience and decided to ""westernize"" (it came out more animeish than the originals) to get that audience while having the new Dev team insult old fans.  They wanted the $5 million and when they knew they weren't going to get that decided $2 million and dropped it even further when it wasn't even hitting that. Capcom really missed why people loved DMC and it wasn't for the story even though it was interesting.  Well this is the same company that killed off their most lovable IP mega man because they have beef with the original creator."

DevilMayCry,303ls0,autowikiabot,3,Sun Apr 5 02:35:26 2015 UTC,"I'll give my personal list on why I think DmC was an insult.   It was a reboot that completely unnecessary for the series.  Etnad and Vorgil were nothing like Dante and Vergil. Both in appearance and in who they were as characters. Since it was a reboot, the lore getting changed was nothing out of the ordinary, but the characters should never change to that much of a degree. Color coded enemies. This vastly limited your options on how to deal with said enemy which is the exact opposite to what Devil May Cry's combat is about. Ninja Theory straight up insulted the fan-base by trying to shove their version of Dante down our throats.  Dumbed down combat style rating system It ran at half the framerate that DMC4 ran at.   I would have been willing to pirate it (sorry, but when a company insults me as a fan, they aren't getting my money) if they hadn't turned Dante in Vergil into those two things in DmC. Change the story? Ok, whatever, the story isn't really a strong point in DMC to begin with. COMPLETELY change the characters that everybody loves in addition to making gameplay worse? Nah, shove it up your ass Ninja Theory. This sums it up pretty well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=BuoUfyMUQTc#t=323  Its also pretty clear that the vast majority agrees since DmC sold less copies than Devil May Cry 2. Financially, saying that it flopped would be an understatement."

DmC regular edition still sold better than DMC3 regular version.  Also, the PS2 was the most popular game system ever sold at its release, so I don't really understand why a new generation coming up would be a barrier for purchase.  I don't understand why a rumor of a new console months away wouldn't keep interested players from spending money on a game that they see on store shelves.  I find it weird that any company selling over a million copies is somehow considered a 'failure'.  Companies like Square Enix with Tomb Raider and Sleeping Dogs, or EA with Dead Space 3 just have astronomically inflated ideas of selling their games because it needs to be more to be successful, which I think is a poisonous way of thinking, for ANY type of game.  I would look at returns more like the (and I shutter to say this) Hollywood industry where a financially successful film is one that doubles the production budget in sales (the production costs as well as for marketing and international distribution)."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,CH_GOROG,2,Wed Mar 25 13:48:18 2015 UTC,"Because the million sold didn't justify the over inflated budget DmC had. It cost more to make the game and the 1 million sold (which didn't even hit their projected sales) did not make the game a profit.  This game cost much more than DMC3 and DMC4 combined and sold much less than either of them which is telling. The reason why DmC3 normal edition sold badly was because of the insane difficult setting for it and the crappy DMC2 which still outsold DmC. When the SE came however it sold much more and became a cult classic that everyone loved.   DmC had to live up to  expectation of DMC4 and 3 and when the developers started insulting the fan base because they were worried it only showed up much NT and capcom don't give a shit about the fans.  All in all 1 million sold copies is a terrible selling point. Hell, resident evil 6 sold $4 million and it still didn't give them justification of the budget they gave that game. These two games bombing was the reason capcom decided to shut down all over seas development branches and stop hiring 3rd party developers   Resident evil is going back to its roots as a survival horror or so I heard and if any other DMC game comes out you know it will be from the original story and the Team that worked for DmC3 and 4. They really wanted to make 5, just imagine if capcom gave them the money and time as they gave NT during the development of DMC4. Would have so much more content.  At least the SE is coming out with 3 new characters to play as."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,mastersword130,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"What was DmC's and DMC 3's budgets? For that matter, what was DMC4's?  It was a different take on the source material for new fans.  It's not like they now retroactively made all the other games not exist.    ""Hell, resident evil 6 sold $4 million and it still didn't give them justification of the budget they gave that game. ""  That's because they had a staff of 600 people working on it, unwieldy genre shifts and huge marketing.  It racked up its cost quite obviously.   I still think the term ""bombing"" should relegated to video games that couldn't be considered financial successes, like Shenmue, Beyond Good and Evil, or MadWorld.  Hell, the sales of Bayonetta were fairly disappointing, but was able to garner a sequel for the Wii U (which still has temped sales).  All of those games had strong critical praise, which is why they had life after their release, which DmC had with critics."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,CH_GOROG,0,Wed Mar 25 17:08:01 2015 UTC,"The budget for dmc3 and 4 was much less than DmC that is for sure.  It bombed because of the poor sales regardless of the critics liked it, even if the players themselves disliked it (I don't trust critics with game reviews anymore, they give anything a 9 if they're paid to).   You should do some research and see how badly the game failed to reach projections. Original from the get go they wanted $5 million sells, they were after that CoD money. When they saw the backlash they lowered it to $2 million but that didn't even happen either. It cost more to make the game than it what they got in profits.  Also it was a reboot so it did make all the previous games not exist which is why people also hated it. But that wasn't my point, my point was it cost more to make than the previous games and sold much less than any of their old games."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,CH_GOROG,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:14:25 2015 UTC,"""The budget for dmc3 and 4 was much less than DmC that is for sure.""  Well, unless you bring out the video game equivalent of Box Office Mojo, you can't make that claim, unless we're now talking about interpretational views of each game's assets and what they mean financially.     But it still sold more than DMC3.  And you haven't shown anything relating to how much it cost for any of the games, so it's difficult to argue that it bombed, which, once again, I still disagree with. Since selling well over a million copies ($60 million) is pretty damn successful for any game.   What does that tell you about Capcom that DMC4's 2.6 million sales still didn't satisfy them?  They're money-hungry and in this ""all-or-nothing"" mentality of ""we need the most money all the time"" rather than a respectable sum, they make outrageous claims.  No one is going to get that Call of Duty money, because that money is already going to Call of Duty, and the hack-n-slash genre will never get close to those sales.  I don't agree with the financial heads at Capcom, but I believe that DmC had good sales and a very strong critical reception."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,GabeDevine,0,Wed Mar 25 17:49:32 2015 UTC,"You have to research the cost of making for each game yourself but it is more from DmC than the original 4 games which is why they fired all over seas developers from their service.  Google will help you there.  Also yes, capcom is known for bad ideas. They utterly destroyed one of their most loved IPs, megaman, because they have beef with the original creator. It also shows how badly they are with the hiring process because they hired NT who still haven't proved themselves since all their games are bombs. They picked the wrong company to help them. Also shows how the director from 3 and 4 had to step in and fix a lot or the issues with the game before release and it still sold badly.  Also it only actually shipped 1 million copies, not even sold so that kinda puts into prospective of how badly the game did. It cost more to make the game, publish it, advertisement than it made from sells."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,GabeDevine,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:10:35 2015 UTC,"Isn't the definitive edition like the ""special edition"" version of DmC?   Pretty much, but I'm betting it doesn't even sell 500k.   DmC regular edition still sold better than DMC3 regular version.   And? As I said, reviews REALLY hurt DMC3's sales thanks to the learning curve. DmC on the other hand, got so many perfect reviews that it was completely laughable how obvious that the magazines were getting paid off. Are you implying DmC was better than DMC3?   Also, the PS2 was the most popular game system ever sold at its release   Which was 5 years before DMC3 launched. The Microsoft vs Sony war was in absolute full swing. Everyone knew the 360 was coming out VERY soon and rationally thought that PS3 would be right behind it. So why spend money on a game for a console that is going to be obsolete in a very short amount of time unless you know you have hundreds of $$ to blow on a video game system?  We know now that PS3 didn't come out for a while afterward, but at the time it made sense.  Lastly, I swear I read somewhere that Capcom didn't make their money back on DmC so financially, it was a loss. In either case, it has still sold less than every main Devil May Cry title and it will stay that way until we see some sales figures for definitive edition."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,Sunnyli1337,2,Wed Mar 25 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"That's assuming magazines were paid off (and I highly doubt since there's no evidence to that), especially since so many independent sites with no advertising for DmC managed to give similar high-praising scores.  And for the ""saving money for next console thing"" doesn't make much sense.  Xbox One was announced in May 2013, but that didn't stop Grand Theft Auto V or Assassin's Creed Blackflag from being a hugely successful games, even with ports to the next-gen being announced.    ""We know now that PS3 didn't come out for a while afterward, but at the time it made sense.""  Wait.  Are you saying that people held onto their money to buy a system that wasn't announced or existed at that time?  If it was SONY fans waiting for a PS3, they would still have money to get a copy of DMC3 while waiting.  And even if it was announced the SECOND after purchasing DMC3 on launch day, it would still be like a year before the actual release meaning that they'll probably be able to earn back that $50 from the purchase of that game before the PS3 launched.  And if they don't have the means to make back that $50, then investing in a video game system or game should be the least of their concerns.  You can't really say Capcom made their money back or not since there's no empirical evidence to point to besides the number of copies sold, and it sold more than the regular versions of DMC3, and DMC3 didn't even sell as well as the first that had similar associations with difficult learning curves."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,mr-mercer,0,Wed Mar 25 18:07:15 2015 UTC,"Theres no evidence? How about the entire fanbase being up in arms over 30fps, dumbed down style rating system, color coded enmies, the lack of a lock on feature and a Devil Trigger that makes the game more frustrating, but yet the magazines are giving the game extremely high ratings all around? No. That was fishy and you know it.   Xbox One was announced in May 2013, but that didn't stop Grand Theft Auto V or Assassin's Creed Blackflag from being a hugely successful games, even with ports to the next-gen being announced.    You're comparing massive triple A games to Devil May Cry. Rockstar could come out with a new GTA game on the fucking gameboy color and it would sell millions.  Also, you're forgetting that DMC3 had non existent advertising. There was ONE commercial for it in the US and ONE in Japan. That was it. Not massive amounts of pre-release coverage and all the other stuff that the likes of GTA and AC get.   Wait. Are you saying that people held onto their money to buy a system that wasn't announced or existed at that time?   I'm saying it played a factor. Like I said, the MS vs Sony war was going pretty hard, at the time, it was a logical line of thinking that if Sony wanted to stay competitive, they had better launch PS3.   You can't really say Capcom made their money back or not since there's no empirical evidence to point to besides the number of copies sold, and it sold more than the regular versions of DMC3, and DMC3 didn't even sell as well as the first that had similar associations with difficult learning curves.   1stly, DMC1 did NOT have as high of a learning curve on the standard difficulty. 2nd, I don't know why you keep bringing up the original version of DMC3. Special Edition is still Devil May Cry 3. And heres another earth shattering fact. DmC is multi-platform. DMC3 was a PS2 exclusive. That alone gives it a MASSIVE advantage in terms of sales. DmC only sold 790k on the PS3, the remaining 800k+ is between PC and Xbox 360. http://www.vgchartz.com/game/44652/dmc/  So if you truly want the fairest comparison possible, it sold over 500k less than the original DMC3 and less than half of DMC3 in its entirety sold."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,BizarreShow,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:56:07 2015 UTC,"The arguments of gameplay were worth talking about on an individual level, but it seemed like critics (and myself) from most outlets enjoyed the combat that was tailored to incentivize new players while also providing a great combat system for veterans [as shown here], the fun platforming brought into the game including boss segments (that are inventive and engaging), and the presentation.  That's not evidence against bribery, that's personal opinion.  You're essentially saying that they must be bribed because they liked things you didn't and saw more benefit than flaw.    Alright, we can also talk about the sales of Metro: Last Light, Metal Gear Rising, Saints Row IV, or Rayman Legends and how they weren't affected by the announcement of a new console.  And to cut you off at the pass, I would easily put all of those games on the same tier of ""status"" as the Devil May Cry brand in terms of recognized franchise (maybe a little more to Metal Gear).    If we're talking about sales and copies sold, are we then going to go into splitting down the DMC4 copies too?  The faireset comparison would be how many copies sold regardless of platform since it still a sale of the game.  Okay, you didn't like DmC, I loved it.  I'm just going to move on and not waste more time on this restating my opinions and arguing the minutia of 'winning sales'.  DMC3 had some pretty extensive advertising in magazines, and on TV.   You still haven't convinced me why in the world people would be hesitant to buy a game in favor for saving up for a console that A) didn't exist, B) had no price tag, and C) would not be released in the forseeable future when they would easily make that money back.  I mean Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Brothers in Arms, Kingdom Hearts II, and God of War seemed to have also sold pretty damn well in 2005, even with the other consoles around the corner."
DevilMayCry,303ls0,BizarreShow,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:51:34 2015 UTC,"1st, you didn't provide any links. Might want to check your formatting.  So let me get this straight. You're using platforming as a selling point in an action oriented hack n slash that lacked one of the most basic functions and was incredibly dumbed down compared to the previous 2 entries into the series? Haha ok then.   If we're talking about sales and copies sold, are we then going to go into splitting down the DMC4 copies too? The faireset comparison would be how many copies sold regardless of platform since it still a sale of the game.   We aren't discussing DMC4. And DMC4 was available to all the same people as DmC. So why on earth would we split them?  Lastly, you just keep rattling on about a new system generation. As I've already stated, being multi-platform was far more of a factor in the overall sales, which DmC has least amount in the entire series.  I get that you love DmC, but the vast majority of the fanbase doesn't and the sales figures back that up.  You've still yet to actually provide a point to this whole thing. You've been grasping at every possible straw and technicality that you could to try and down play the fact that DmC has sold the least amount out of every Devil May Cry and that most of the fans thought it was trash.  You love DmC, I think it was a steaming pile of shit that wasn't worth the plastic used to make the gamecase. How about we leave it at that?"

I actually hope something like Capcom releasing a comic telling an ""alternate"" story of DmC, one that shows how DmC was actually an illusion, something else, something that only existed in the minds of both protagonists, a twisted background inside their heads, like dreams. Meanwhile, they were actually doing that stuff, but in the real world. Imagine a Cambion Dante fighting side by side with a Cambion Vergil, defeating a corrupted demon king Mundus who actually is trying to enslave mankind trough war - not trough debts - while at the very same time, there's a whole alternate mirrored universed in which both Nephilim Dante and Vergil are actually fighting a corrupted banker-demon dude at the top of some buildings.

(i never could avoid her full room lightning blast.) and most of them were certainly the best in my opinion. past that? berial, from dmc4. i don't know what it was about berial, i just loved this boss, his design, the fact that he CONQUERED FIRE HELL-(whatever that is) and even goes so far as to admit that he's weaker than those he's fought, most demons are too prideful, but berial will outright admit it when a person's stronger, even if his determination to continue what he knows to be a hopeless fight leads to his demise. I honestly wanted to see him make a reappearance, he had the best personality out of the bosses in this series as well."

DevilMayCry,2zt126,AnAppallingFailure,2,Sat Mar 21 17:46:50 2015 UTC,Agni & Rudra from DMC3 were my favorite. RG Just Block until the RG gauge is full and then Just Release the second jump attack with a concurrent DTE and their health just melts away. It kills them on the lower difficulty levels.

Even though 4 was basically half a game, it was still really fun.  I'm not losing any sleep over the Definitive Edition though.  I liked just about everything in the base game, except for what I was supposed to like.  Dante and Vergil were like...what. And I'm not of the ""nyurrrr Dante is all emo hurrr"" crowd.  He's just a terrible, poorly written character, and Vergil isn't much better.  They both just seemed like different versions of the same asshole instead of good vs. evil, savior vs. sinner, etc. The combat, the soundtrack, the enemies, the graphics, those were all good. But the two characters who matter most were weeeeeeeak.   The only thing I'd like to see from the Definitive Edition is the improved combat.  I thought the combat was already pretty damned sweet and flowed well. But I wouldn't have shelled out more money just for that."

DevilMayCry,2zonng,Dreceratops,4,Fri Mar 20 20:11:13 2015 UTC,"it most decidedly does not.  DmC refers to the reboot, DMC refers to 1-4.  If you want to cause a huge shitstorm, when you report your findings label the reboot as ""DMC5"""
DevilMayCry,2zonng,kampasta,2,Fri Mar 20 20:18:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know what happens when you call the reboot DMC 5. In my last comment, I meant the OP/whoever made the survey probably used DmC as a catchall for the franchise. My bad, I should've been clearer."
DevilMayCry,2zonng,Dreceratops,2,Fri Mar 20 20:26:29 2015 UTC,"I think, if that is what the OP meant, they may want to simply say 'Devil May Cry', since that's more of a catch-all for the entire franchise."
DevilMayCry,2zonng,scionicspectre,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"yup.  When I want to be ambiguous, I'm extra careful to actually spell out the words ""devil may cry"", all lowercase, so nobody can assume one way or the other."

DevilMayCry,2zonng,scionicspectre,2,Sat Mar 21 05:22:27 2015 UTC,"well, that's the thing though.  The capitalizing is how a large portion of the fanbase is actually explicit in differentiating between games.

DevilMayCry,2zonng,kampasta,1 point,Sat Mar 21 07:10:44 2015 UTC,"Me, too. In my answer, I mentioned them separately and only talked about DMC 'just in case' that's what the survey meant by it. I think the only reason I thought it meant anything other than DmC is that the survey seemed to be taking a very general approach to the series as a whole, and it would be odd to omit the original series."
DevilMayCry,2zonng,scionicspectre,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:23:03 2015 UTC,I just finished DMC 1 for the first time yesterday never played the series until a week ago. I love it! aside from the reused bosses and subtitels for dante it's a masterpiece.
DevilMayCry,2zonng,AzuresX19,2,Fri Mar 20 14:25:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm, do you mean Phantom?  Nelo Angelo has a backstory that correlates with why he is fought multiple times.  Each fight is different too."
DevilMayCry,2zonng,Chaotix247,4,Fri Mar 20 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah nelo was a cool boss especially his 3th fight.  but fighting the phantom,griffon,nightmare 3 times each was a little too much.  especially because you only have 4 big bosses in the game each repeated 3 times."
DevilMayCry,2zonng,AzuresX19,3,Fri Mar 20 21:50:14 2015 UTC,"I think you'd really appreciate DMC 3.

DevilMayCry,2zosuv,Shameuno3,2,Fri Mar 20 13:19:26 2015 UTC,Well it changes how your doppelganger attacks so change it depending on what goes best with your play style or the enemies you're against.

DevilMayCry,2ze7c6,tucker42,3,Tue Mar 17 21:05:01 2015 UTC,that was the one detail I thought really rocked the game. just seeing dante's hair evolve like that was really cool.
DevilMayCry,2ze7c6,TBAAAGamer1,3,Wed Mar 18 00:28:14 2015 UTC,"Not that I know of, and it really kills the mood when your friends want to see you beat it and you have to explain to them what's supposedly happened to Dante. I think they should just have it occur whenever you're in-game as the original DmC Dante."
DevilMayCry,2ze7c6,scionicspectre,2,Wed Mar 18 23:50:06 2015 UTC,"So wait, if you rock his original hair color it doesn't happen in the story that way anymore?   Or can you only have white hair after beating it on that save file?"
DevilMayCry,2ze7c6,BetelGeuse-1987,2,Thu Mar 19 16:17:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah after beating the game, Standard becomes white hair with coat. Original is black hair with coat.

DevilMayCry,2zey7g,Shadow5040,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:43:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this sort of pettiness would be extreme."
DevilMayCry,2zey7g,kampasta,4,Wed Mar 18 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"adding content to a game is not something you can just pretend to do for several months and then fart out in a few weeks once you've confirmed you actually want to make a lot of content instead of a single cutscene (and that alone can be months of work on its own).  If they wait until DmC:DE's sales are good to ""reward"" their community with a better DMC4:SE, they're essentially sitting around doing nothing while they wait for sales numbers.  Best case they would be starting work on the special edition right now, and then releasing it mere months from now, trying to convince us they spent the better part of a year working on it.  Certification alone can take many months.  Starting work now, when the slated release date is this summer, would just be insane.  The more likely situation is that they've been working on both editions for long before the announcements came, and they aren't going to intentionally sabotage their game just to make up for bad sales numbers.  Call them what you will, but capcom is a company run by businessmen (rather than game designers) and they aren't going to keep a studio on payroll for that long, doing nothing, just to release an intentionally shitty game as ""revenge"" for poor sales for a different game.  Here, I just shot myself in the foot.  Don't like that?  Well as revenge, watch as I shoot my other foot, too.  TL;DR - I don't think capcom takes this DMC vs DmC rivalry as seriously as you think they do"
DevilMayCry,2zey7g,Dreceratops,-2,Wed Mar 18 03:10:34 2015 UTC,"Capcom hates money, or so it would seem. Like I said, just a hypothetical notion, nothing to get upset over. but again, the depths of pettiness don't have a measurement, so you never know. I for one think we'll be getting a playable vergil."
DevilMayCry,2zey7g,scionicspectre,2,Wed Mar 18 03:16:17 2015 UTC,"Well, Capcom does hate money, so nothing is ruled out completely. Lockon seems to have been implemented but scrapped, and I'm pretty sure the new cutscene was more like a deleted scene instead of a brand new asset. That leaves hardcore, God Must Die, Must Style, and  the other tweaks as things that can't be accomplished by ""simple"" modding. DE addresses some of the things that fans hated and was released 2 years after the shitstorm, so I'd assume any number of sales is a profit for Capcom.  Also, I heard this from a streamer on the DMC 4 SE teasers: If they only released info on DE and nothing on 4 or the classic series, that would essentially be Capcom saying ""DMC is dead, but here's more DmC because it's exactly what the fans asked for."" The SE teaser probably exposed more people to the DE trailers and probably made a few people give the game a second chance."

DevilMayCry,2zbo93,Dreceratops,2,Tue Mar 17 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"I still think they dropped the ball in terms of the ""important super serious side"" of the plot, but I do like what they did with their ""they live"" knockoff, this is legitimately the only devil may cry with the stones to rip off they live and turn it into something to hit with your sword."
DevilMayCry,2zbo93,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"Did the original DMCs need ""the stones"" to rip-off They Live? I've never watched it, how good was it?"
DevilMayCry,2zbo93,Dreceratops,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:15:17 2015 UTC,"To be fair, if you were to rip the plot of that movie off in any context and try to get away with it, most people who instantly recognized it would shake their heads in disappointment, so it takes balls to commit and try to make it work like DmC did. I gotta say, in terms of level design, not even dmc3 made something work this well.  but even so the ""serious"" elements of the plot just didn't work with the fun side of it."
DevilMayCry,2zbo93,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:18:07 2015 UTC,"also, dmc2 did actually try to have a corporation commentary in a city setting. DmC is the only other devil may cry to feature a city as prominently."
DevilMayCry,2zbo93,TBAAAGamer1,5,Wed Mar 18 00:39:43 2015 UTC,"That the devil may cry series has never been a serious one. it's a series where the main protagonist is just doing over the top stuff and having a good time. and well....DmC does a pretty good job of portraying that very thing. it's crude, but it's very much the devil may cry attitude, just a different flavor of it. Honestly, if you were fighting a big giant floating bill o reilly head and sabotaging his newscasts by entering one of them and beating up demons before jumping out, could you honestly say that this was a moment meant to be taken seriously? dmc3 is an example of the perfect balance of serious and over the top. on the one hand, dante was riding a rocket, driving a bike up a tower and running down said tower at the speed of a comet. on the other hand, the tale it was telling along the way was a very serious one about dante being forced to fight his brother. it had a stable balance of the two. DmC only had one half of that equation, but it was a half it did super well."
DevilMayCry,2zbo93,TBAAAGamer1,3,Tue Mar 17 18:37:20 2015 UTC,"I dunno, DmC had it's silly moments, but it feels like it's taking itself seriously a lot more often than the previous ones. The entirety of mission 11 and 12 are serious, and Kat getting shot is almost as bad as ""filling your dark soul with light"" without the overly bad acting to enjoy yourself. I can't tell how much of the story is ironic ""commentary"" and how much is what Tameem believes is something that ""rivals film."" In mission 16, Kat says the people in the finance wing ""are no longer human,"" with a totally straight face. The game was taking itself so seriously that I couldn't take it seriously.   The originals were great because you were a white-haired anime hero and the enemies you fought were all super silly or metal as fuck. The more realistic aesthetic changes and the ""Shakespearean"" story didn't really help DmC. While it has it's moments, the hamfisted, unsubtle ""commentary"" either means that the story takes itself more seriously than people think, or that the whole thing is a joke and I was the one who got fooled."
DevilMayCry,2zbo93,Dreceratops,2,Tue Mar 17 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"I always saw it as ironic to the point of being funny when kat said ""they're no longer human"" and i'm looking at these shadows of people flying to the walls and contorting in awkward positions. it doesn't hurt that the place you're in is literally corporate hell. followed by elevator hell. so in my opinion the serious themes you cited were at the very least humorous in just how goofily they were presented. It's like I said in a prior wall of text ""DmC sets itself up with super serious commentary shortly before dante comes in, bitch slaps it and loudly shouts ""this is devil may cry!"" and proceeds to wreck everything, laughing while he does it."" I loved the way the levels were presented, but the parts of the plot, the serious stuff involving dante's character development? it just felt awkward. like they were trying to build his character, and failing horribly because the moments of him becoming more of a good guy were disjointed, disconnected and simply didn't ""work"" for him. they could literally have made him old dante in terms of personality right from the get-go instead of bringing that personality near the final levels and we would have loved him. instead the most dante moment we get is twofold, the elevator hell sequence where he cracks a joke, and the following drekavac fight where he says absolutely nothing at all. he just cracks a smile while the two are squaring off. those two moments were old dante in the best possible sense. and it bothers me that we can't get more of that."
DevilMayCry,2zbo93,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"I was always hoping it was super ironic, and sometimes it's more obvious, but other times it feels like ""yeah, this is super contemporary and deep."" Maybe I came into the game too jaded or expecting to hate it.   But I'm glad we agree on Dante. I mean, eventually he grows on you, but his growth up to that point was pretty awkward. Do you think it was awkward solely because of the writing, or do you think his acting/voice were to blame as well? His voice just sounded whiny a lot of the time, like when he uses Eryx, and the voice clips used during rainstorm are just super awkward."
DevilMayCry,2zbo93,Dreceratops,3,Tue Mar 17 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say his VA did an okay job, (though we shan't revisit the worst offending moments) but no, it was definitely the writing. it's like they were so busy trying to write a step by step process for dante loving and siding with humanity that they forgot to add that part in, instead making him change halfassedly throughout. don't get me wrong, he ends up a solid character, but there's no rhyme or reason to it, he just, becomes dante near the end. and that's the problem, we were supposed to be shown a new dante ""becoming"" the old dante across the series, and we even had a LOT of promising stuff to work with. the idea that dante grew up fighting for his existence every single day, always fighting and struggling to survive, that shit was gold and they fucked it up halfway through by ignoring the ""I'm nothing but an animal, but now I can be human"" process, they just jump from ""Angry Hobo demon slayer"" to ""Cocky demon hunting badass"" with no fundamental reasons or situations that show how he slowly turned into this character. we get a few scenes with kat that ""kinda"" explain it, but there's nothing definitive. vergil just comes up to him, says ""Hai kill demonz fur me."" dante goes ""sure, why thfk not."" and the two kill demons and then mundus, becoming a good character right at the end. that's bad writing, we get this promising premise and literally next to no real developmental situations for dante to grow, he gets to feel sorry for kat, advice from phineas (who I think was the best addition and actually did a lot for the development with a few short lines) and suddenly he's uncle dante in his twenties. it just doesn't work."

That is, download the changelong - it's around the middle of the article and you have to click another link to download it. In that, they detail which collectibles were moved to where. So if you look at where the collectibles used to be, you can go check if they're there in-game, and if not use the change log to figure out where they moved it to. Hope that helps."

Vergil is kind of a self-assured douchebag, looking down on humanity with his snooty-eyed glare.  Gameplay-wise, though, despite Dante's wider array of options, I'd put them on equal ground because the just-timing with Vergil plays to my strengths, much like Royal Guard and demon evade. I like those kinds of movesets since they really reward me for staying on my toes and planning things out ahead of time. Don't get me wrong, Dante has plenty of this, but it seems more robust on Vergil's side of things."

So Vergil slowly regained his power in Hell and came to the human world. If it's handled in a fashion like this, then it will take place after Nero defeated the Savior.   However they handle it, I just want to be able to play as Vergil with a new move set and maybe a new style other than Darkslayer. I really hope they bring back DTE's, too. It was one of my favorite parts of DMC3. Full RG release coupled with a DTE just wrecked and it was tons of fun to execute."

It probably is going to end up being before the game, as that seems easiest to implement but all im hoping for is just interactions with vergil and dante/nero"
DevilMayCry,2yuowk,Broshadian,1 point,Fri Mar 13 08:35:20 2015 UTC,"vergils involvement will most likely be a prequel to vanilla dmc4 explaining some story elements. this one i don't really like but it is the easiest to execute by capcom.  the best case scenario without capcom actually altering the main game is adding vergil either before or after the game, with full cutscenes and interaction with dante and nero, which i definitely hope is the case.  theres only so much you can be optimistic for knowing capcoms past of lazy and greedyness, but my hype knows no bounds."
DevilMayCry,2yuowk,Broshadian,-1,Thu Mar 12 23:58:55 2015 UTC,"i think Vergil's part will be after event in DMC 4, he come to nero to take his Yamato back(Dante know that Vergil will come and beat the shit out of who dare take his Yamato away, so in DMC 4 ending, Dante give Nero Yamato so he wont be bother by his mighty brother) P/S: It Just a game theory =))"
DevilMayCry,2yuowk,quangdn295,1 point,Fri Mar 13 00:59:38 2015 UTC,Who is making these new scenes anyway? The orginal developers?
DevilMayCry,2yuowk,flawless_flores,1 point,Fri Mar 13 08:19:52 2015 UTC,"Spoilers ahead.  Uncle Daddy Vergil is gonna be fully playable. Considering that the Savior destroyed entire city of Fortuna when Nero killed it/him/thing and that the city of Fortuna looks like a normal city, DMC4SE is either gonna explain how the hell does Nero have the blood of Sparda and why is was Nero able to resurrect Yamato (and Vergil's reaction to that, obviously) or Vergil confronting Nero, taking back Yamato, and something something Dante.  But then again, I feel like there are some questions that need to be asked.  *Vergil doesn't have Yamato in the teaser (right before the fading-out begins, the wind lifts up his rugged cloth, revealing the lack of Yamato's sheath. There is also no bulge in the cloth during the full-body/lower-body shots which would be Yamato), that he lost Force Edge at the end of DMC3 and that he's not shown wearing Beowulf, how are we going to fight enemies up until Nero? Or even get Yamato from Nero? I doubt Nero's going to willingly give up his Devil Trigger. Maybe this could go back to the idea of Phantom DT, DT and Perfect DT.  Vergil being a cambion (half-demon half-human), whose DT is Yamato, could use a Phatom DT (ex: Nero's current DT is a Phantom DT) until he gets Yamato, which unlocks his regular DT. However, Vergil is shown saying ""I need more power"", and a lot of his decisions were based on the ""How much power am I going to get? Is it worth my time?"" mindset. Also, he wanted to be like Sparda ever since DMC3, so maybe he had some time before DMC3SE's Vergil intro (him standing in a library) to have sex with a human/demon/cambion? At any rate, I'm pretty sure that we will see some form of Perfect DT for either Vergil or Dante. Dante was originally intended to enter a Perfect DT and go berserk, but that was probably scrapped because, you know, how the fuck would you defeat him?  Nero, however, could get his own DT. In DMC4, he unlocked his DT when he remembered Kyrie being endangered and resurrected Yamato when he was on the verge of death, saying ""...and if I become a demon, so be it. I will endure the exile. Anything, to protect her."" , meaning that he would go all-out if she were to be in grave danger.  *If this game is a sequel, how far off from DMC4 is it situated? If it's a prequel, how far behind DMC3 is it going to be? I mean, we know that Vergil got enslaved by Mundus after DMC3 and he was basically a brainwashed zombie at that point, until Dante freed him from DMC1.   The answer: Probably during the anime.  We didn't see Vergil or Nero, or even Fortuna during the anime. However, it ended with Lady, Dante and Trish going after a mutual contract. This could mean that they're going to meet Vergil, either as him being the caller or as him being the ""demon""?  At any rate, we've got a lot of teasers coming up in the next three months. All we can do now is speculate.  Also, on a gameplay note, I heard that Vergil's gonna have styles, just like Dante. The styles would be ""Dark Slayer"", similar to Dante's Trickster style (hell, they're even coded under the same ID in DMC3. Source), ""Nelo Angelo"", which would give him NA's moveset from DMC3SE and 1, replacing Swordmaster, some form of Royal Guard (he's shown being able to parry, either with his sword or with his fist - see any Vergil battle from DMC3 that you want as proof of this), and some form of Gunslinger, but for his Summoned Swords.  I don't remember exactly where I read that from, but it's just speculation.  Edit: Minor mistakes"
DevilMayCry,2yuowk,Warsc2k,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:49:45 2015 UTC,"I think they will do the same trick they did in DMC3SE, except this time i they'll add more cutscenes.  Don't get me wrong, i hope for addinational missions that are unique for Vergil, new weapons/skills/combos/whatever, but i doubt this will happen."
DevilMayCry,2ysso6,iwascuddles,9,Thu Mar 12 15:00:01 2015 UTC,"There is almost no mention of angels in the original series. In the original series Sparda sealed Mundes and the gates of hell successfully saving humanity and becoming legend. But, in doing so lost most of his own powers and fell in love with a human who had twin...you should know this. Eve was mostly a normal human, and Devil May Cry 1 was about Dante following in his father's foot steps and defeating Mundes like Sparda did years ago, Dante unlocking the full extent of his demonic powers and defeating Mundes in this was insanely epic. We don't talk about DMC 2, the third game was a prequel focussing on Dante and Vergil's rivalry and how they viewed being Sons of Sparda and humans. This is my favourite in the series and I like how Vergi is presented here much better, Dante grows a bit similarly to how he did in the reboot and the final battle is in my opinion much better."
DevilMayCry,2ysso6,Shameuno3,7,Thu Mar 12 16:16:02 2015 UTC,You are an amazing person. Thank you for all of this. I like the part about DMC2. haha.
DevilMayCry,2ysso6,andreaschrst,3,Thu Mar 12 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"I have been a fan of the series, finished multiple times all the games (except the second one with which I got bored) and I have to say that I loved the reboot, except a few things here and there.   This is my opinion on some aspects of the game in the context of comparing them with the main series (I will try to omit/conceal spoilers as much as possible but be warned that it might contain information you might not like to know):  STORY:  Overall the cutscenes and dialogue (at least as far as the ones concerning the plot of the reboot) in the main series are shorter. That left more margin for atmosphere.  Angels never come into play; Dante and Virgil's mother was a human.  Mundus is not personified to the extend of this game and he has a different goal.  Virgil was not Dante's long lost brother. His involvement in the Mundus plot is very different.  GAMEPLAY:  The gameplay of any devil may cry is its strongest feature. Having said that, I think the gameplay of the reboot is the best, not with a wide margin though. Bare in mind that this might not be the popular opinion though.  Another strong feature of DMC is the difficulty. The difficulty in this one is not up to par with the most challenging of the ones from the main series.   Also, the boss battles. I think the boss battles are up to par with the ones from the main series, maybe a tiny bit less but not enough to be a problem.  GRAPHICS:  The graphics are great and smooth; the best from all DMCs (kinda unavoidable though since this one is five years after the previous one).  AESTHETICS:  The aesthetic aspect of the graphics is good and somewhat varied but I think it deviated from the atmosphere that was conveyed in the main series. In an objective scope, the aesthetics are great but in comparison I think the main series gives a more appropriate feeling regarding the story and setting.  SOUNDTRACK:  The soundtrack is great but in the same spirit as the above point, I think the soundtracks from the main series is better and more appropriate.  CHARACTERS:  The main characters from the reboot talk way more than their counterparts from the main series (except the girl which is a new character) but not really giving more depth to be honest. The characters from the main series behave less ...frustrated? I'm not sure how to describe this. They are more collected.  That's all that comes to mind right now. And remember that this is my opinion, it might not be the same for you. I place more emphasis on the gameplay/soundtracks/atmosphere than anything else when it comes to DMC."
DevilMayCry,2ysso6,TBAAAGamer1,2,Thu Mar 12 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the reboot focuses heavily on the demons, angels, their conflict, but does absolutely nothing to explain or even justify their existence. they're kinda just there for dante to hit REALLY hard for no reason outside of ""mundus bad, vergil good, humanity? what humanity?"" what it DOES do right is what it does with its level design narratives, and by this i mean it turns various important aspects of society that we consider flawed and bothersome into shit for dante to hit REALLY hard for no reason outside of ""This level is made of dubstep. I must kill everything in it."" or ""This demon is a parody of bill o' reilly that I can hit REALLY hard. I am going to monopolize on this."" or the ever infamous ""This is the slurm queen......this is a boss...that is the slurm queen.....fuck."" the reason this works is because the silly, ridiculous nature of the level designs and commentary FIT a devil may cry attitude the way they're presented. they're fun, silly, over the top moments that aren't meant to be taken seriously, despite being presented in an overly serious manner, like bob barbas ruling over the souls of the damned in an upside down version of limbo city while brainwashing people with fake newscasts, or the fact that the aforementioned dubstep level is influencing people and turning them into drones for lilith to use in order to find mundus's enemies. or the fact that the slurm queen's slurm is made to make people docile cattle. yet when dante enters the scene these supposedly menacing moments become ridiculous, goofy over the top fights and scenarios that pretty much define how a devil may cry game should be. so, in essence the plot is throwaway, it asks a lot of questions, then new dante comes in and bitchslaps those questions as hard as he can for no better reason than ""fuck your commentary this is devil may cry!"" and for the most part, it works. it's not a particularly well told story, and the ending feels forced as all hell as we get nothing on why this incarnation of dante loves humanity like his counterpart despite not being human in the slightest, but you get the sense that this is a game about freeing oneself from the importance of the world's problems and just having a good time. and that's really a vital element of any devil may cry game that I think needed expanding upon. that said, this game is ""just okay"" despite the wealth of design choices that got more work than most AAA titles."

My first Devil May Cry game was the third one and I thought it was fantastic. The follow up felt very much like an unnecessary sequel. Lots of strange Cameo's and re-used ideas. Virgil was great and his role was best explored in the third game. Tacking it on here seems to serve as a promise to return to the old canon. Trying to sell the remake off nostalgia for a character doesn't sit right with me.  I'm also sad to see so many people skipping the trailer ""to get to the good part"". I thought the trailer was really well put together, and highlighted the unrewarded effort the DMC studio puts into it's work."
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,berky115,10,Wed Mar 11 06:29:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think that effort is unrewarded, even fans like me who are basically only loyal to the originals have had good things to say about the reboot and even without playing the definitive edition I'm aware that what they've added to the game is a very welcomed improvement and serves only to shrink the gap it caused in the fanbase.  And i don't think I've seen a single bad word spoken about the launch trailer itself as it was very well made.  I'm simply wanting to see what people think about the new teaser and whether or not it makes them feel like their favorite character will actually be integrated into the game properly and not just tacked on (which has been the general assumption of what Vergil's involvement would be from the start)  I can see where you are coming from but discussions about the reboot seem to be the majority around here so i don't see how you come to the conclusion that ""so many people are skipping the trailer"" just because i personally would rather discuss a different game."

That game, especially when compared to its predecessor, feels unfinished. Makes me wonder if Capcom completely misjudged how much money HD development was going to cost and ended up misallocating the budget. The core gameplay is great, but the fact that you have to run through same 11 levels TWICE and have to fight all the same bosses THREE times dampens the experience."

DevilMayCry,2ynfke,King_Doorman,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:32:54 2015 UTC,"Seemed unnecessary. They've been more than generous with DmC info, but they seem pretty hush hush on DMC4SE details. Unless I just haven't been paying attention."
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,Foonsaki,1 point,Wed Mar 11 11:16:16 2015 UTC,You have to remember though... The special edition is still 3-5 months away.  I may have been out of the loop but I don't remember hearing about the definitive edition 3-5 months ago.  But please correct me if I'm wrong about that because I just may not have seen it myself.
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,smilesbot,2,Wed Mar 11 11:45:13 2015 UTC,"I don't remember when the they were announced. All I remember was the 1st trailer I saw had both of them and 90% of it was about DmC and seeing 1080p/60fps shoved in my face right off bat.  Part of me thinks that their withholding DMC4 details because more people would rather have that instead of DmC.  If they released DMC4 first, DmC probably wouldn't sell as well since the game is only a few years old and easier to find.   Either way I hope DMC4SE does well. Maybe then Capcom will consider having DMC and DmC coexist. They've invested to much into DmC to pull the plug. Sucks for people like me that don't like the game, but whatevs, guess I can stick to DMC 1-4 and Bayonetta."
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,Foonsaki,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:20:19 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, Ninja Theory has officially stated that they will not be doing a sequel to DmC."
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,scionicspectre,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:12:56 2015 UTC,That's surprising. I wonder why Capcom is still posing the game then.
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,Foonsaki,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:23:49 2015 UTC,Well it's not exactly official but the general consensus is that Capcom are trying to give fans a chance to express which direction they'd prefer the series to go... It seems they're not just pushing the reboot to the side until they're sure which series would be the better choice to continue.
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,scionicspectre,3,Thu Mar 12 07:06:17 2015 UTC,Here's to hoping for a DMC5.
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,Foonsaki,2,Thu Mar 12 08:09:09 2015 UTC,"I really want DmC 2. I Liked the story, I liked the characters, the combat (IMO) was the best in the series and the ending of both the normal story and Virgil's Downfall both led a cliffhanger that i really want to see continued. the only thing i didn't really like was Rebellion's redesign, it just looks off to me."
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,scionicspectre,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:54:19 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough...  Despise being an avid fanboy of the originals I'd just be glad to keep getting Devil May Cry games either way.  It's just hard for me to want a continuation of the reboot when the story I grew up on has room for continuation.  Not that I don't think DmC deserves sequels, I just know what I'd choose if I could have it one way or the other... It's a damn shame that there's really no way to have both."
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,Chaotix247,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"I'm worried. The two trailers have only shown  brief glimpses of someone who might be Vergil. Whereas for the DmC trailer, they have shown gameplay of everything that's new. Makes me wonder if DMC4 will actually have Vergil as a playable character or if they're just adding a few cutscenes with him. And if he is a playable character, will he have his own levels or will he just be playing on the levels already in place.   If he is playable, he won't have Yamato with him unless his campaign starts after Nero kills the Savior and he takes Yamato from Nero. I'm on the fence with this update."

I'd say just temper your expectations so that you can fully enjoy whatever extra features we get. The fact that this game is being revisited at all is enough for me, and the fact that we'll get any Vergil cutscenes to begin with is encouraging."
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,DMV7,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:07:43 2015 UTC,"If DMC4 has Vergil as a playable character, then I need to shell out for a PS4 as well as the game. This game is the reason I'll get a PS4, so I want it to be good. The only other game I'll get a PS4 for is if they make a Metal Gear Rising sequel. Or subsequently a brand new Devil May Cry game (not DmC)."
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:43:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd advise you to get excited about a few other games, since I love my PS4 despite having a pretty beefy PC, and if I were to drop 440 just to pick up DMC 4: SE, I wouldn't be giving the remaster a fair shake. If you want a slightly remastered game to give you a good impression of the PS4, that's just not going to work out even if it's the best combat gameplay you can find on the system.  There are plenty of other awesome titles that have come out and will come out in the next year or so, so I'd get hyped about any of those if you have it in you. Otherwise, I'd advise waiting until the PS4 is a bit cheaper. In fact, I think they already did a decent price drop, so don't pay 400 if you don't have to."
DevilMayCry,2ynfke,DMV7,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:29:20 2015 UTC,Appreciate the advice. Probably won't consider the PS4 until later in the summer. Any idea if there's going to be a slim version or something similar to that coming up?

Vergil's overwhelming influence in the story of DMC4 is not subtle what so ever.  His Yamato, Nero 's ability to wreck life with it, and Dante mentioning him are not coincidence.  Now the question is, if Vergil is involved, when exactly is he coming in? During the events of 4? After? When Nero is in trouble and he senses it?"

The one complaint I have is the first thing they do is highlight ""there has always been..."" which, as far as storytelling mechanics go, is one of the laziest ways possible to explain something.  Do we give angels and demons an interesting origin or backstory?  No, ""there have always been angels and demons"".  Get out.  My hype runneth over for vergil, though"

Hardcore mode is definitely meant for after you've completed one playthrough and have all the weapons unlocked, but honestly hasn't added anything for me personally. Turbo mode looks interesting, but I'm afraid it's gonna make me motion sick, but I'll try it at least once.  However, the best thing about it is the 60fps and 1080p. It makes combos so much easier to make, and parrying has never been more fun. As a PC gamer, it still looks a little strange, but I've been playing with SweetFX and other mods for awhile, so really it's just me getting used to vanilla again."

For the bosses, tho. They have different patterns, damage output and even make some ""enhanced"" attacks... The most notorious and easies example is Bob Barbas boss fight.

I hope it sells enough so that we can see a sequel. My favorite of series is DMC3 because it is super special to me, however I found the new DMC to be the best(in terms of fun and story). Only bummer on the definitive edition is that there is no achievement for beating it on hell or hell mode or gods must die.

DevilMayCry,2y8irx,PM_ME_STAB_WOUNDS,3,Sat Mar 7 12:54:18 2015 UTC,"You're saying it's possible for Vergil to fall in love, have a child, lose the woman he loves and spiral into madness all before the age of 18-19 (not sure the exact age but that is the age of the twins in DMC3)  And since Dante is estimated to be about 31 in DMC4 (this is through piecing together chronological event based on the knowledge that he's 19 in DMC3) that would mean for Nero to be Vergil's son he'd have to be about 12-13 in DMC4 according to this theory.  Now here's the thing... The creators themselves have been known to overlook chronology at times. I remember reading that one of the creators stated that Dante was approaching 40 years old in DMC4, which would obviously make it more reasonable for Nero to be Vergil's son, but then certain dates and ages wouldn't match up properly.  So basically what it comes down to is this... If anyone (namely, the creators) were so officially follow chronology, then the theory couldn't work due to unreasonable ages (I know the Japanese has a knack for portraying very young teens as older but surely there is no way Nero is supposed to be 12).  Or, the creators do what they do best and take liberties with the timeline and the story to suit their ideas then, yes, I believe that the theory technically could be made true in that sense.  So in closing.  If you're the type of fan that area about the chronology of the timeline (like myself and other diehards do) then it can't really work.  If you're the type of fan who enjoys the story regardless of that and are fine jus accepting what the creators say is legit (which I see no problem with since they are the creators after all) then it could work.  So how's that for a wall of text? Anyway just want to say I appreciate posts like this and it's these discussions that keep the community so close to me.

Lady's visual age seems to fit the time line though. In dmc3 she's a teenager, and Japan has this habit of making teenage protagonists around the 15-16 range, so I'll assume that age. I know that's not exactly an ironclad rule, but it seems true more often than not. Fast forward to dmc4, lady looks to be pushing 30, and if Nero was born one year before dmc3, that puts him at the prime Japanese teenager protagonist age of 15 or 16."
DevilMayCry,2y8irx,kampasta,2,Sat Mar 7 20:40:24 2015 UTC,"Sparda apparently lives for thousands of years without even losing his charmingly good looks, I think it's reasonable enough to assume that Capcom has room to bend the timeline if it's built around how old dante looks to be"
DevilMayCry,2y8irx,ThnderDwnUndr,1 point,Sat Mar 7 20:50:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I mean this game has Japan written all over it, teenagers could look 20 like almost every anime ever made for all I know.  I'm basically just giving you what details we do have about the timeline, for example...  As stated by the game director, Dante was 8 years old when his mother died, and in DMC1 Dante says ""I lost a mother and a brother to evil 20 years ago"" which mean he is undeniably 28 years old in DMC1. He has also stated that Dante is 19 in DMC3.  The producer of DMC1 and 4 has stated that Nero is the same age that Dante was in DMC3 making Nero 19, and he also stated that DMC4 takes place 10 years after DMC3 making Dante 29 in DMC4.  So since Dante and Vergil are twins, Vergil would have been 10 years old when Nero was born."
DevilMayCry,2y8irx,ThnderDwnUndr,1 point,Sat Mar 7 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"Hm, good point. I wonder how they're going to reconcile this plot hole. Nero is named blood of sparda more than once during the game, and there aren't many options for where he could have descended from. If they do commit to just making nero officially a descendant of sparda, the special edition might need to retcon some things"
DevilMayCry,2y8irx,ThnderDwnUndr,1 point,Sun Mar 8 10:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah true, I'd be curious to see what they do.  Perhaps they could have some plot twist where their mother didn't die and had another child 2 years later... Then you could just factor in the original theory of Vergil's death creating the devil bringer and it finds it's way to Nero completing him with the blood of Sparda."
DevilMayCry,2y8irx,TBAAAGamer1,3,Mon Mar 9 00:20:56 2015 UTC,"nah, I feel like the death of eva is way too important to the character developments of dante and vergil.  Dante watched eva died and came away with the belief that humans are stronger than demons, a very crucial (and controversial) aspect of his character.  Dante watched a supposedly weak human stop a pack of angry demons out for the blood of sparda's offspring, and now values his humanity in a world where where humans throw away their souls for just a shred of demonic power.  Vergil sees the same death, which seeds his eventual belief that humans are weak and pitiful (eva died to some pretty low tier demons) and decades later he's willing to commit genocide if it'll make his human side less dominant..  Undoing the death of eva would undo the very seeds of who dante and vergil go on to become.  It would be much easier to just say the twins age slowly, and nero is vergil's ~15 year old son"
DevilMayCry,2y8irx,TBAAAGamer1,1 point,Mon Mar 9 07:35:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely agree with you there, that was very well put... I'm just spitballing ways to make Nero legit blood of Sparda without him being Vergil's son that's all.  I mean I know they could just make up a reason as to why he is his son but they'd be contradicting themselves if they did.  But... It comes off like I would hate the game if they did that or something which I totally wouldn't at all."

But that's just my opinion :P  I mean the reference is even in my name > Cold Vergil < Which is why i like him.  What i'm really interested is in DMC 3 when they fight together to beat the clown and Dante says to him: ''Remember what we used to say?'' Vergil: ''Jackpot!''  That part has always interested me, what was it before that? They were cool to each other? That's something i'd love to see and know more about."

Sure, as he is in 3 he isn't looking for any love, but what about before? Before this point he apparently was at least fun loving enough to share dante's ""jackpot"" catchphrase.  We get one brief, shining moment where dante might just think vergil is coming back to his old self as he works with dante to beat arkham, and then he sinks right back down.  A good tragedy is when it could have been avoided, but character flaws pull away from salvation at the last moment"
DevilMayCry,2y7d3p,TBAAAGamer1,6,Sat Mar 7 02:46:41 2015 UTC,"Just give old vergil the moveset of new vergil, the ki charge taunting of old vergil, and the style rank increasing sheathing of old vergil, update his look a bit, give him a fuckton of alternative costumes to play around with and a story we'd find compelling and he'll be the best vergil in existence."

DevilMayCry,2y7d3p,hotshotvegetarian,2,Wed Mar 18 21:11:17 2015 UTC,"I actually use several different types of cancels. the first and easiest to use are the angel teleport cancels, best used mid-combo to fully reset vergil's stance. then after that there are trick cancels, where you alternate between trick up or down and a move, after the first successful trick cancel it loops into a ""cancel"" state where if you use trick up and say..divorce, you remain grounded and continue using trick up's teleport while remaining rooted for as long as you continue alternating between it and divorce. finally there are jump cancels, jump on an enemy after attacking to cancel the attack animation and do another one, giving you new opportunities to open up damage."

You may be surprised to know that most of the optimizations are merely clever artwork tweaks. While these guys knew their engineering, the artists did a great job of squeezing everything out of the engine's limitations. You just don't see this kind of production value in the west.  That said, I'd really like to see if they can do just a bit more with the Special Edition to polish one or two things that are feeling slightly old-fashioned.

DmC refers to the ninja theory series, DMC refers to the series under kamiya/itsuno.  Yes, the capital ""M"" really matters.  DMC dante is a human/demon hybrid, while DmC dante is an angel/demon hybrid.  Also, DmC is its own series, so there is currently no such game as DMC5 (since this is a common misconception, many google searches for DMC5 will incorrectly redirect to DmC anyway).  In fact a lot of hardcore fans of the original series will actually take ""DmC is DMC5"" as an insult."
DevilMayCry,2wi330,kampasta,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:38:00 2015 UTC,DMC3 is a prequel to the events of DMC1. I personally wouldn't worry too much about whether or not he is still alive regardless. Capcom isn't quite known for being consistent with their games.

DevilMayCry,2vusy9,DMV7,3,Sat Feb 14 10:55:11 2015 UTC,"different weapons have different strengths and weaknesses, but all of them are pretty amazing.  A really standard starter combo is rebellion and cerberus, as it has some really simple weapon switch combos that end up being very simple and effective.  For example, launcher -> switch to cerberus -> attack -> switch to rebellion -> helm breaker.  For tricksters, moves with fast and powerful aerials synergize well, so agni&rudra, cerberus, and the shotgun are great.  For gunslinger, nevan and artemis are insane.  For sword master I prefer agni & rudra over beowulf because it has better range and speed, and for huge damage ultimate tempest trumps a real impact, and lands more reliably.  For royal guards, it's all up to you.  Use whatever weapons feel best to combo with ( I stick to rebellion + cerberus) because your weapons won't have much of an impact on how well royal guard performs.  Mind you, none of this is set in stone: if you find that nevan and trickster feel great, rock on! In the end it's about what makes you feel like a crazy badass, and these are just some simple hints to get you started"

There's a vault that contains all of the game audio and some art concepts from all three games as well as some DMC4 concept art. Unfortunately, however, the game does not come with better customization options. Like in-game brightness adjustments and full button mapping. There is also the fact that in DMC1 the subtitles are half-assed and not always on-screen when it should be, but that's my personal grief. I bought it a while ago and would recommend getting it if you want to have all three games on a single disc that runs better and is more easily accessible.

DevilMayCry,2ubvbc,kampasta,2,Mon Feb 2 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, brea is well known for that total disregard for gravity. Oh man, and I can't believe I almost forgot, but definitely look up Dango!   Sadly he's decreased, but he's got a solid Nero, and his Dante is a huge troll with royal guard. For a new player, a lot of his Nero play looks like senseless craziness, so here's a few tricks to look out for in this video that even a new Nero could start working on.   1) max-act everything. Having your sword just blow up is too good. 2) table hopper is god tier. Nero's last second dodge doesn't just get you out of danger with minimal lag, but it can be chained, and used to reposition safely and offensively. 3) that thing he does where he jump cancels his launcher into an immediate helm breaker. For when you absolutely gotta go fast and don't want to wait for Nero to stop floating to follow up, jump cancel. Also sets you up to learn advanced tricks later on after mastering this. 4) my personal favorite because it's simple. Nero's DT transformation has a few frames of invulnerability, which I find arguably more useful than the damage bonuses it gives. With clever use you can avoid damage without ever retreating from attack range; a pretty typical use is demonstrated in the link, when dango uses it to avoid taking a hit from the angel armor team energy ball attack without needing to give up his combo  Hope this helps, stay crazy!   Edit - bonus video! credo is a great boss to style on using table hopper and DT invulnerability, so if you're looking to learn those things, look for videos like this one"

DevilMayCry,2tjih4,Shameuno3,2,Sat Jan 24 20:10:47 2015 UTC,"Any new Devil May Cry game is appreciated imo. DMC used to be the best game in the action genre because of it's innovative combos and stylish gameplay; however the repetitive nature of this over the course of several  games (DMC 2 not included) new innovation was needed, which is why we saw DmC: Devil May Cry. Of course not everything DmC2 brought was good, but it definitely had a lot of potential. I personally think that both of the new games annouced, DmC2 V2.0 and DMC4:SE are going to bring a lot of new things to the table in the same way DMC1 did."

DevilMayCry,2tc5rf,gmoneygangster3,6,Thu Jan 22 22:29:01 2015 UTC,"One of the most essential concepts in DMC is directional input. This is where you use R1 to aim at an enemy and either hold back or forward and an attack button (triangle or circle, depending on which Style you're using).  There aren't a lot of these attacks to begin with, but one of the most iconic things to do in Devil May Cry is to hold R1+Back and press triangle to scoop enemies up into the air. You can just tap triangle to stay on the ground, or hold it down to follow them up into the air.  Once you're up there, it's up to you whether you want to shoot to keep yourself and the enemy suspended in air, to press circle to do an optional circle attack, or to bring them back down with triangle.  If you can do all of this, you've grasped the basic core of the game. Aside from directional attacks, there are pause combos. A simple one with Rebellion is where you slash once, wait, then continue for an alternative attack.  So, if you find you aren't having a lot of luck varying your gameplay, just focus on the directional inputs and pause combos and you should be having fun in no time."
DevilMayCry,2tc5rf,scionicspectre,3,Fri Jan 23 05:07:33 2015 UTC,I would suggest going back to the first 2 missions to learn how to use attacks. Make it a point to use that new attack you learned at the statue in your fight against these worthless minions.  Give it a few goes and BAM you can now do the move effortlessly whenever you want which makes it easier to do it on enemies.
DevilMayCry,2tc5rf,Perplexed_Comment,3,Thu Jan 22 23:06:54 2015 UTC,"Is it a delay you're talking about? Check to see if your tv isn't on a setting that delays the image.

DevilMayCry,2tc5rf,DMV7,0,Fri Jan 23 07:32:00 2015 UTC,"The thing I hate about DMC3 is that most the moves rely on the use of the right analog stick. Other than that, it's mostly a fixed plane from point A to point B and the occasional puzzle/backtracking.  You'll get used to that, but as far as being pro when it comes to the movesets? Eh... It'll take some practise using the right stick.  A big thing about DMC3 which DMC1 and 2 didn't have is the use of Gunslinger or Trickster. DMC3 is based on your playstyle. If you wanna do more damage with guns, use Gunslinger. If you want to dodge easier, use Trickster."

DevilMayCry,2t5xyp,Kronos616,2,Thu Jan 22 22:49:21 2015 UTC,"I thought the story was fine for a spinoff/alternate universe, but the writing and the slurred speech for Dante's acting kind of threw me off. The combat system and music compliments the game quite well. Also, I never played the PS3 version of DMC4 but I reckon it isn't too bad (I only got it on the 360 because I wanted to have the achievements to shoot for). As for PC, I'd say the PC port of 4 is phenomenal."
DevilMayCry,2t5xyp,Dreceratops,2,Fri Jan 23 07:45:48 2015 UTC,"DmC is a better game than DMC4, the problem being that it is broken as fuck and the 30fps don't help much, the problem with DMC 4 is that it is incomplete, some fans call it the oldest early access in gaming because the content is really poor however the combat is way better than DmC and it runs at 60fps which are handy in action games like this.   Wait until the DE and the SE are out."
DevilMayCry,2t5xyp,RussellLawliet,2,Wed Jan 28 03:19:20 2015 UTC,"DmC doesn't match the Platinum games, but it offers a pretty competent combat experience compared to most other games out there. If DmC is your first DMC game or first game in the genre in general, you can do some pretty badass combos from the get-go. But if you know the ins and outs of the rest of the series, DmC is fairly easy in comparison. For example, while jump-canceling and staying in the air took some time to learn in the past DMCs, DmC has tools and mechanics that make staying in the air trivial. I can't really call DmC as a whole ""bad,"" but if I want to call it ""good"" than I'd have to call 3 and 4 ""perfect"" or ""amazing."""
DevilMayCry,2t5xyp,Dreceratops,2,Wed Jan 21 18:25:21 2015 UTC,Platinum have never made a DMC game.
DevilMayCry,2t5xyp,RussellLawliet,3,Wed Jan 21 20:07:10 2015 UTC,"What I meant by that was we haven't had an actual DMC game since ~2007/8, and that by the time DmC came out, it had to compete with both the old series and whatever Platinum games had came out, games which tended to occupy the same genre."
DevilMayCry,2t5xyp,Silentlone,3,Wed Jan 21 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. Yeah, in that case, I think I'd agree."

DMC3, that is damn near perfect. DmC combat system is more simple and less deep, but the game as a whole balances itself out with DMC4 imo."
DevilMayCry,2t5xyp,ColdVergil,3,Wed Jan 21 20:07:37 2015 UTC,"DMC 4 was half of a game with boring levels, out of place platforming, and like 4 tracks of music, but the depth of it's character action carried it for me.

DevilMayCry,2t5xyp,RussellLawliet,2,Wed Jan 21 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that spin-offs can be as much fun or even more fun then the original games to some people. For example I like Metal Gear Rising more then the Metal Gear Solid games (MGS 5 might change that tho :D) 'cause of the different gameplay.  But going back to DMC5, most boss fights are awesome and fighting the harder, mixed packs of enemies on higher difficulties can be challenging. Character animations and movement are much smoother as well. Overall it's a great experience if you can just look past the rather lame story and more 'modern' world it's set in."
DevilMayCry,2t5xyp,Bloodhit,2,Thu Jan 22 02:43:21 2015 UTC,Very true! I think a lot of this could be the technology and game engine though. If Capcom would make another DMC I'm sure it would be even better if used with current engines on the newest gen consoles and PCs.

Thanks for the response!"

IMO its only worth it for 3. 1 is a lot more slow paced and more focused on puzzles with less deep combat and 2 is straight booty. Also this is the first time i heard DmC: DMC be referred to as DMC squared lmao"
DevilMayCry,2t3uwt,z01z,2,Wed Jan 21 21:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah the souls series is my favourite, I'm gunna order the collection soon, im really excited to them it out!! Haha yeah I thought DMC2 fit pretty well."

DevilMayCry,2skvi3,Deadxcell138,2,Fri Jan 16 02:27:40 2015 UTC,Nero is Vergil's son like in the books is cannon enough for me. I'm thinking there will be a segment where he will have somehow survived DMC1 or is revived in his non Nelo(<-look familiar?) Angelo form
DevilMayCry,2skvi3,Deadxcell138,2,Fri Jan 16 02:32:24 2015 UTC,"i'm not saying he isn't, which would make the idea of vergil using nero to be reborn all the more sinister."

DevilMayCry,2skvi3,Gabu-chan,2,Fri Jan 16 03:16:10 2015 UTC,I always thought the 'I'm entrusting Yamato to you' and the silent goodbye following 'will we meet again?' was implying some dark twist in the future. This theory would certainly fit in.
DevilMayCry,2sh4qa,PL-QC,6,Thu Jan 15 02:58:38 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna get killed on this sub for saying shit like this, but I think Bayonetta really is one of the best games of the genre. But DMC is similar, and very good too. DmC4 is not the best one, but speed will pick up. The best one most people agree is DMC3. It's another very unpopular opinion here, but I liked the reboot a lot too (its my favorite) , a bit faster although less though and complex than previous DMC games."
DevilMayCry,2sh4qa,Shadow5040,4,Thu Jan 15 03:08:40 2015 UTC,"What the reboot did well was level design... by like a mile compared to other devil mary cry games. The story actually made sense. The combat was extremely accessible, but it had limits. However, the characters were boring and played out. The AI of the enemies was abysmal. Three guys would be on screen, I'd be beating the shit out of one of them, and the other two would just stare at me while I did it.  Oh, and Tameem Antoniades alienated the previous devil may cry fans. But that has nothing to do with the game, he's just an ass.   All in all the game was good, but not great. But the only devil may cry game that I thought was TRULY great was Devil May Cry 3. 1 was okay but didn't age well, 2 was awful, and 4's level design was disgustingly bad."
DevilMayCry,2sh4qa,PL-QC,3,Fri Jan 16 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer, I now understand the dislike better. And you're right, what I loved about the reboot was the story that made much more sense, and the great level design. But DMC3 was great indeed."

DevilMayCry,2sh4qa,Bloodhit,2,Sun Jan 18 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"If talk specifically about DMC4, game more opens on the harder difficulties when you already unlocked everything.  Just watch someone DMC4 DMD SSS playthrough, its gets really fast paced.  I also found this review of DMC 3&4 pretty much doing great job summing up both games."
DevilMayCry,2sh4qa,Dreceratops,2,Thu Jan 15 06:22:48 2015 UTC,"If 4 feels a bit slow, turn on Turbo Mode and wait until you unlock more moves and Dante. When you first start DMC, it may seem more barebones compared to a Platinum game, but the skill ceiling is incredibly high. Platinum combines excellent build-up, music, and style in general to create set-pieces that make even QTEs and button mashing incredibly satisfying, but DMC is able to make you feel like a bad-ass with it's core gameplay alone. I'm not saying that Platinum relies on QTEs or button mashing, but DMC has some very satisfying combat.   I haven't played 1 or 2, but I hear 1 is fondly remembered. Play it knowing that is set the basic ground rules for the character action genre as we know it. Also play it while keeping in mind that DMC 1 was originally Resident Evil 4 and look at the similarities it shares with the older RE games.   Never played DMC 2. I heard that you shouldn't bother. Or you could give it a try.  If DMC 1 laid the foundations of the genre, 3 is the genre's crowning achievement. Every cut-scene is ""Is Dante seriously doing this? Yes, yes he is."" Every music track fits the tone and the style of the game incredibly well. While the camera is sometimes not the best, you'll appreciate the variety in level design and aesthetic as well as the enemy and boss design. And while incredibly hard even on normal, DMC 3's gameplay set a bar so high that some will argue has not been reached in the past decade. From it's sound design to the particles that fly off each hit, every weapon and attack is a joy to use. While you can just mash and swormaster style and still have fun, there's skill to be seen in every facet of gameplay. From getting bonus damage from letting go a charge at just the right time to being able to cancel the rest of an aerial attack by jumping off the enemy, DMC 3 features both spectacle and mechanical delight. The entire experience is enjoyable, especially if you're interested in investing time into becoming better.  The same cannot be said about DMC 4, a game that is only really enjoyable if you want to invest time into it. If you enjoyed the DMC 3 experience as a whole but didn't enjoy the combat enough to learn all the ins and outs, play DMC 4 once or as many times as you can stomach it. In terms of characters, story, music, style and aesthetic, and just excitement in general, DMC 4 can not hold a candle to DMC 3. To understand the full extent of it, you unlock Dante halfway through the game only to play the first half in reverse, only as Dante. They weren't super exciting to play as through when you were Nero but now you're going through it in reverse. And then you keep beating it to try to unlock DMD and it's all aghhhhhhhhhh.   But if you're interested in deep combat, you came to the right place and some may say that DMC 4 Dante has more gameplay possibilities than DMC 3. The 4 main styles in 3 are now all usable at once without having to go through a menu. There are only 3 guns and 3 weapons, but they are all incredibly distinct and have their own purposes. Most of the main mechanics from 3 are still there, and combined with ~4.5ish styles in total, you can sink a lot of time into learning Dante. Nero's actually pretty interesting himself, but he only has 1 style, 1 gun, and 1 sword. But he effectively changes enough mechanics to differentiate from Dante and Vergil while being able to accommodate both higher and lower level players. If you love deep combat systems, that is one of the few things that DMC 4 excels at.  Currently, the de facto version of DMC 4 to play is PC, hands down. Yes, it runs on last-gen consoles at 60 fps while looking reasonably good, but PC has is locked at 120 fps, has even shorter load times, and supports debug mode which makes training and replaying only specific segments much easier. It also runs on a miracle engine that puts current gen games to shame. DMC 3 takes a bit of work to get running well on PC, but also has access to the style switcher mod which mimics Dante's abilities in 4. But I hear very good things about the HD collection, so feel free to go with that.   tl;dr: 1 is a classic actually worked on by Kamiya, 3 is an amazing all around experience, and 4 is only really exciting in the gameplay department, but worth a playthough none the less."
DevilMayCry,2sh4qa,Vittas_Nichye,2,Sat Jan 17 12:34:53 2015 UTC,"I just started my exploration of action games with Bayo and MGR, and I just finished the DMC HD Collection. It's not the same kind of action game as Bayonetta, but DMC3 is still one hell of party. Definitely give DMC1 & 2 a whirl, but DMC1 only because it's a Kamiya game, and DMC2 only to see the improvements from the first game, and both of them together as practice for the control scheme of DMC3. DMC3 is great, it's just much less forgiving and four years older than Bayonetta. DMCxBayonetta when?"

Personally I like the first game more than the 2nd or 3rd because the soundtrack is better and the mansion is totally Resident Evil-esque (it should be known that DMC was meant to be Resident Evil 4 but the team felt it was too supernatural for RE standards, so they changed a few things and made it into its own game)."

DevilMayCry,2sayuz,TheMagicGlue,1 point,Sat Jan 31 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"Well, let's start with an observation. Pretty much everything NT has done with design has been a deliberate theme, dante in this game looks and fights like he's some loose, chaotic fighter, but that's the trick. he's actually a VERY setup heavy character who relies less on jump cancels and more on the physics in the game and his gun and juggle tools to create unique combo ""traps"" that set him apart from his classic dmc3/4 counterpart. Conversely, vergil comes off as a character who is heavily reliant on setups and cleverness due to his limited moveset, but this is where the deliberate but super subtle design elements become very apparent. vergil's downfall, and summarily vergil himself, are PURE opposites to the main campaign, I can't stress that enough, it's painfully evident that they wanted to make downfall as clearly opposite to DmC as they could, the music, the level design, the enemy waves, even the plot. and finally vergil, who despite coming off as a setup reliant character, is literally as far away from that as possible thanks to his abundance of cancels. not even rare akuma has this many cancels, he can cancel out of virtually everything save for 1 move. and this leads to him playing super expressively, my VmD cakethrough with the boss? nothing compared to the enemy waves I tackled in the other four cakethroughs. vergil is so extreme that I can honestly say he might not have limits on what he can do, it's all a matter of what you want him to do, where dante = what you want to do to the enemy. vergil is a very freestyle character disguised as a cautious and hard to use one, so keep that in mind and try everything you can with him. you'd be amazed at what he can do. suffice it to say he plays like a parody of his classic counterpart, old vergil was very limited and had tools he had to rely on, like summoned swords, kara sheathing, etc. this vergil? he's rape in devil may cry form."

DevilMayCry,2s62k3,Bloodhit,2,Mon Jan 12 21:29:48 2015 UTC,"Well, they didn't release any info about him yet, so the safest bet, he will be just bonus character to play in a Bloody Palace. Which is cool, but not really that exciting.  They can't just let him in the main game like in DMC 3, there way too many devil bringer platformer elements in Nero part of the game. Maybe give him a go only in Dante levels would work?  I really need more info about how Vergil will be handled in a SE, to get hyped about it."
DevilMayCry,2s62k3,DeathDevilize,1 point,Mon Jan 12 21:52:20 2015 UTC,"They would just give him the necessary moves for devil bringer platforms, like they did in DmC. If they bring the already dead Vergil back to the game it really doesnt matter if they give him some new stuff too.

With all the clever dialogue in the reboot, taunts probably would have been something super witty like ""fuck you!"".  Oh wait, that already is a taunt against the Slurm beast.  God, that was cringey."
DevilMayCry,2rblok,AJockeysBallsack,7,Tue Jan 6 01:34:46 2015 UTC,At the risk of the down votes. I can say it's tied or better than DMC4. Which was my 1st favorite before. I really really like DmC. I have been making a real effort to 100% the game on PC. I completely agree with you on the combo comment.

DevilMayCry,2rblok,HardDifficulty,2,Tue Jan 6 13:44:46 2015 UTC,"Well that's disappointing.  Not unexpected, but disappointing.  $40 for what amounts to a re-release.   Edit - forgot it was for next-gen systems, probably took a good bit of effort.  Still, I won't be buying them outside of the semi-annual Steam sales."
DevilMayCry,2rblok,AJockeysBallsack,1 point,Tue Jan 6 13:54:30 2015 UTC,"That's actually the standard price for remasters, and at least they are not being so greedy like Square Enix by charging $60 for half assed 30fps remasters with little improvements.  Have you been around gaming forums and articles regarding remasters/re-releases on next gen consoles? $40 is godsend compared to other greedy publishers, and we're talking about Capcom (the greediest) here and they are not even charging $60 for their re-releases."
DevilMayCry,2rblok,HardDifficulty,2,Tue Jan 6 13:57:53 2015 UTC,CAPCOM wants to see where fans are lying on the franchise. Do we like douche Dante with shitty combos that play like DMC2's combat system. Or do we want good ol' uncle Dante with flashy combos and advanced combat system that DMC4 offered?  Im buying the hell out of DMC4: Special Edition  Honestly the only reason I am willing to give DmC: Definitive Edition a shot this time around is because of two things: 60 fps and manual lock on. People can try to blow off how it's not a big deal--get real. It is the biggest deal in any hack n' slash.
DevilMayCry,2rblok,leftstrummer,3,Thu Jan 8 10:19:44 2015 UTC,"It really is stupid easy in the new game. Demon dodge and use the axe. Combos are worst off in DmC while combos were the bread and butter or DMC.  Damage is what gives off ranks in DmC, not combos."

DevilMayCry,2qxoys,Brendyrose,3,Wed Dec 31 17:43:27 2014 UTC,"When I think of hack n' slash, I think of games with very basic, repetitive combat. Picture a game like Diablo or Baldur's gate, where combat consists of clicking on an enemy over and over.  The DMC games are sort of the opposite of that. They have very complex, varied combat - almost like a single player fighting game."
DevilMayCry,2qxoys,o0joshua0o,2,Wed Dec 31 18:02:39 2014 UTC,Yeah. I prefer the term stylish combat game - or as the best friends zaibatsu calls them - character action games.

That way also makes it so you experience the lows of DMC2 and then jumping into DMC3 which is a masterpiece, rather than ending on the sour DMC2 note. ;)"

DevilMayCry,2qteck,Inferno__,1 point,Tue Dec 30 15:13:51 2014 UTC,"Gameplay is incredibly repetitive, the guns are like better than every other weapon for some reason? So you can just shoot everything to death, the only thing the game really added that furthered the combat system was instant gun switching if I recall correctly.   The melee weapons literally add nothing, they're all pretty much variations of the same thing. Story is a mess, game was rushed and it shows. Dante's design is pretty cool, so there's that I guess...  Best way for you to see is to play it yourself. Then play DMC3 and see the insane improvement."

DevilMayCry,2qmbo3,Perplexed_Comment,2,Sun Dec 28 16:41:33 2014 UTC,Pretty sure 4 takes place after 1. At this point Vergil is dead.

DevilMayCry,2qmbo3,Adam_Absence,4,Mon Dec 29 07:08:51 2014 UTC,"Fair point, but it was a pretty decisive death in DMC1. My assumption is that DMC4:SE will have new content built in-engine, since it's coming out in the summer. As far as I can tell, that might mean we have a backstory for Vergil(between him getting stuck in hell and becoming Nelo Angelo). Or shining some light as to why Nero was the protagonist for the 4th game.   Edit: actually, upon rewatching the cutscene. Nelo Angelo only explodes in a light show, I suppose they could ret-con him back to life. Mundus only says that he was ""defeated""."
DevilMayCry,2qmbo3,DMV7,3,Mon Dec 29 07:16:39 2014 UTC,I can imagine Nero's devil trigger and Yamamato playing some role in his come back.

DevilMayCry,2qj234,HardDifficulty,7,Sat Dec 27 13:06:34 2014 UTC,I just hope delinquent dante died out with DmC...
DevilMayCry,2qj234,DeathDevilize,3,Sat Dec 27 13:24:43 2014 UTC,I'll never understand why people hate DmC Dante so much. Hes not likeable by any means. But the sheer amount of ridiculous hatred he gets baffles me because hes still a lot like the original Dante. They're both cocky pricks that make cheesy one liners and jokes.
DevilMayCry,2qj234,DeathDevilize,0,Tue Jan 6 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"With one being your average thug and the other having actual intelligence, thats a huge difference. Honestly i would have even prefered edgelord666 from the first DmC trailer over this guy."
DevilMayCry,2qj234,mastersword130,2,Tue Jan 6 22:13:58 2015 UTC,"Define ""actual intelligence"". As I look back on all the versions of Dante(DMC1-4) I find it hard to believe people actually see them as that different.   If we're being more specific DMC 1, 2 and 4 Dante are arguably much more mature. Especially DMC2 since hes super serious like all the time. But DMC 3 and DmC Dante's are both annoying punks.   And the renditions seen in 1 and 4 still retain the cheesy cockiness. Of course with their maturity its toned down. And he probably also has better one liners. But its still a core component of his character.   Which brings us back to my point. Theres very little difference between DmC Dante and the original Dante. And I think its a little fucked the way people trash his young persona and we'll never get to see how he developed with time in a sequel due to the game selling poor."
DevilMayCry,2qj234,Land-Shark,4,Wed Jan 7 05:16:36 2015 UTC,"I'll personally be fine if both franchises kept going since just like there are DMC fans, there are DmC fans as well, like release original DMC one year, and the next release DmC, makes it refreshing and competitive between DMC developers and Ninja Theory."
DevilMayCry,2qj234,mastersword130,2,Sat Dec 27 13:28:59 2014 UTC,"Ninja theory is fired and no longer working with Capcom, thank the 'verse. I'm glad they won't work on a DmC 2, if people want more of that type of gameplay they're welcome to playing demons blade."
DevilMayCry,2qj234,mastersword130,3,Sun Dec 28 06:31:36 2014 UTC,"They weren't fired, they are not owned by Capcom."
DevilMayCry,2qj234,mastersword130,5,Sun Dec 28 07:58:15 2014 UTC,I think Mastersword means Capcom won't give them the license for any more games in the DMC franchise.
DevilMayCry,2qj234,z01z,-1,Sun Dec 28 10:16:22 2014 UTC,They were hired outside the company to make the story and gameplay. They were supposed to be on retainer to make sequels but it bombed and it was a PR nightmare. So they fired them from ever touching DMC again.

Vergil as a playable character will be enough for me.  I'm also looking forward to DmC too. I had a great time with the original DmC, even thought it wasn't exactly what people had come to expect with Devil May Cry, it was still a fantastic action game, and the Definitive Edition looks to really improve on a lot of things.   I'm now CONVINCED that DMC5 is in development."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,Inferno__,-7,Sun Dec 21 05:23:26 2014 UTC,I am too. Also I'm thinking/hoping that DMC5 crosses the dimensions/timelines - resulting in both versions of Dante/Vergil meeting and Nero caught in the middle.

Yes, I can elaborate, the following is gone:    60fps  Lock-on  Accurate Style system  Ability to customize your way of play and weapon choice to suit your tastes  Dante's personality   But I'm sure you'll tell me I'm just pissed about the hair color."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,SmokinSickStylish,5,Wed Dec 17 14:28:17 2014 UTC,"You really didn't read the changes in DmC:DE? Most of this stuff is back, now we'll really see if it's about the hair or not."

Tameem's crew made fun of Dante at length."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,SmokinSickStylish,5,Wed Dec 17 14:33:39 2014 UTC,"Don't remember being called losers or being insulted. All I remember is Tameem trolling the people who hated him on twitter, just like other devs on twitter, e.g Kamiya, etc."

DevilMayCry,2piv2b,HardDifficulty,3,Wed Dec 17 15:33:16 2014 UTC,"While dante might not exist in real life, his character does. People can relate to and grow to love Dante's character.

It's also for $40, wtf are you talking about man... most of Capcom's rereleases are fantastic and well received by the media and the community, like Street Fighter 4's incarnations."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,HardDifficulty,-2,Wed Dec 17 17:58:33 2014 UTC,They could for the pc version at least. After all the pc version already has 60 FPS 1080p. It just needs the balance fixes and other changes.  Also street fighter 4 let you upgrade to arcade and ultra through DLC.

DevilMayCry,2piv2b,starburstempire,2,Thu Dec 18 12:12:00 2014 UTC,"God this post is old, but I'll do my best to sum this up neatly. If DmC were an entirely separate game from the franchise, it would not receive any hate. But the game's existence precludes the existence of another DMC game, and you have to judge the game by comparing it to a hypothetical classic DMC game, not by its own merit. And by its own merit, it falls spectacularly flat when comparing gameplay."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,DMV7,8,Sun Dec 21 05:30:45 2014 UTC,"Please humor me and imagine for a moment that it wasn't a Devil May Cry game, but just a standalone. For me it seemed that way, since it was the first one I played. When considered on its own, it's truly a fantastic game. The combat is very solid and enjoyable, the enemy designs are fantastic, the levels are varied and interesting, and the storyline is engaging. It seems to me people are disappointed because they are holding this one up to an impossibly high standard. It's not a perfect game, but it's a damn fine game nonetheless."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,o0joshua0o,5,Sun Dec 21 05:31:26 2014 UTC,Though as a stand alone game it's still outclassed by Bayonetta 1 and 2 as well as Metal Gear Rising. And that's just this gen.
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,runnerofshadows,1 point,Sun Dec 21 05:50:51 2014 UTC,"Even considering it as it's own game (which it isn't) it's still just a decent character action game at best, it's not on par with what currently exist on the market (Bayonetta 1&2, Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance, Wonderful 101 ...) it's not on par with DMC3 (2005) and much less DMC4 (2008) either. If you're not really into the combos and mechanics of the game or the only remotely action game you played before was God of Wars then sure DmC is a good game."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,Hka9,2,Mon Dec 29 05:56:21 2014 UTC,"I'll have to respectfully disagree with you. Also, bringing Wonderful 101 into the discussion is really mixing apples and oranges."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,o0joshua0o,3,Wed Dec 17 15:31:02 2014 UTC,"Mechanics and depth wise there's no debate to have, DmC is a downgrade from DMC4/3. And Wonderful 101 IS a character action game there are combos, a scoring mechanic, cancels, parry even a lot of similar moves to DMC (stinger, lunar phase,...) once again it's not really a debatable point. I'm not saying you're wrong just for the pleasure of it of course, it's a good change of pace to have a respectful conversation about this series."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,Hka9,1 point,Wed Dec 17 16:11:04 2014 UTC,"I beg to differ. Wonderful 101 is about as similar to the Devil May Cry series as Pikmin 3, and DmC has very deep combat. Maybe you didn't put enough time and effort into DmC to see it. Did you stop playing after the cutscene poking fun of the white hair?"
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,o0joshua0o,6,Tue Dec 23 23:48:31 2014 UTC,"No you see I completed the game, in every difficulty. It is not as deep as DMC4 or DMC3. There's a reason why most top players didn't make any combo videos on DmC and those who did came back to DMC4 pretty fast, brea, UltimeSon (one of those who came back to 4 after getting pretty much everything he could out of DmC), Kail/Kyle, Ramada and the list goes on and on. And the fact that you don't see the similarities between W101 and DMC kinda proves my point. Also don't asume that I didn't play DmC just because I don't like it, I didn't care about the hair color.  Look I've had this kind of discusion so many times that I'm really getting tired of it and I don't even want to elaborate but I will a bit...  30fps, color coded ennemies, shit boss fights, laughable difficulty, way too easy to get an SSS combo and keep it, no more styles... those are the pretty big points without going in too much extensive details about it. I know for most people those are pretty little things and I get that but to make a comparison let's see Smash Bros, when Brawl came out it was a perfectly fun game and not so much different than Melee and yet the competitive players stayed on Melee because it was a better game in it's core mechanics and gameplay.  Now, a lot of these things are going to be adressed in the SE sure, those are also complaints that only a minority will have too but it doesn't change the FACT that mechanics-wise and gameplay-wise at least DMC3 and DMC4 are better games than DmC (in the state it first came out at least, but I'm not too optimistic about the SE surpassing DMC3/4)  Edit : To make it perfectly clear, if you're not as into the mechanic of the game as knowing about cancels (jump, dodge, guard, slash,...), buffering, advanced weapon switching, just framing... most of those complaints will be completely irrelevant to you and you'll have your fun with the game without noticing a lot of difference with the previous titles."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,Hka9,1 point,Thu Dec 18 10:54:37 2014 UTC,"I found DmC's gameplay to feel rather clunky to be honest, compared to the other versions. I also found the mid air dashing repetitive and just redundant."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,deviant2k,3,Thu Dec 18 13:42:15 2014 UTC,"Same, I actually liked the whole game, I only really ever played a bit of DMC3 and completed 4 many times, so I don't have a lot of experience with DMC but I still found the reboot to be great and it's a great way to get people interested in the older games IMO."

DevilMayCry,2piv2b,HardDifficulty,-7,Wed Dec 17 10:17:41 2014 UTC,"No they didn't, capcom is just trying to recoup their loses and fix everything nt did to get at least a mediocre game."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,mastersword130,5,Sun Dec 21 23:36:28 2014 UTC,"Yes they did, whether you like it or not, at the end, they did. No need to disagree about this, let's not be children about this debate and just agree."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,HardDifficulty,-1,Wed Dec 17 07:36:12 2014 UTC,"Sure, they listened, but not before launching an all-out social media attack on the old fans.  Fuck Capcom and DmC"
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,SmokinSickStylish,2,Wed Dec 17 18:52:05 2014 UTC,That wasn't capcom but NT. Capcom looks like it's trying to fix it only that is way too late for that.
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,mastersword130,2,Wed Dec 17 02:29:12 2014 UTC,I can't accept that Capcom isn't at fault. They own the IP.
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,SmokinSickStylish,0,Wed Dec 17 06:05:44 2014 UTC,"Its their fault for hiring a team that shits our turd instead of gold. They hired a fucking team that didn't produce one hard hitting great game, the most they ever did was make a mediocre game with an alright story but with DmC even NT didn't outsource a writer like they did before.  I blame who ever in capcom thought hiring a mocap company that makes crappy games was a good idea. Still not their fault that NT went ape shit on social media sites alienating fans."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,mastersword130,1 point,Wed Dec 17 10:47:16 2014 UTC,"It was Inafune who green lighted the DMC reboot and wanted to to be more western focused, wouldn't have existed if Inafune didn't have that much power at Capcom in that time, we would've probably got DMC5 instead."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,HardDifficulty,1 point,Wed Dec 17 13:35:17 2014 UTC,I have no problem with a reboot more western focus if they actually picked a competent developer.   I know even if he greenlight it he didn't suspect that the people they hired were just terrible at their job.
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,mastersword130,1 point,Wed Dec 17 15:36:46 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he knew, Inafune is knowing for his terrible decisions when he was at Capcom, e.g green lighting FPS western developed MegaMan game, screwing up Clover studios and getting them out of Capcom (Kamiya doesn't even like the guy on twitter)."

DevilMayCry,2piv2b,HardDifficulty,2,Wed Dec 17 16:25:17 2014 UTC,"Yeah, ninja theory was fired from capcom after DmC. Seems they're trying to fix the game as much as they can, they even had to bring the old team that made 3 and 4 to fix the game while it was still in development and it still came out as that game.

DevilMayCry,2piv2b,HardDifficulty,2,Wed Dec 17 14:27:49 2014 UTC,"I'd consider Spectacle Fighters a specific type of hack n' slash game that focuses on complex, stylistic combat. It might help you find similar games if you know the more specific name."
DevilMayCry,2piv2b,o0joshua0o,0,Wed Dec 17 15:34:35 2014 UTC,I've heard it called a character action game by the best friends zaibatsu. Which sort of fits as well.

DevilMayCry,2pdg23,lastmexisamurai,6,Mon Dec 15 17:56:22 2014 UTC,Definitely more excited for what looked like a Vergil teaser in the special edition. After a lack of info or really anything related to this series I love that it's finally getting some attention.
DevilMayCry,2pdg23,JP891,2,Mon Dec 15 23:12:13 2014 UTC,Yeah dude i'm excited for Dmc 4: Special Edition. I really don't care much about DmC :P
DevilMayCry,2pdg23,runnerofshadows,1 point,Mon Dec 15 18:15:20 2014 UTC,Since they're making special editions in both universes - what if they made 5 and had it cross universes? As long as the gameplay is tight and characters are different enough that could be great.

But really, that 5 seconds of DMC4 Special Edition got me super extreme hyped! Are they going to add Vergil to DMC4's story?! Make him a bonus playable character?! Explain whether or not he is Nero's father?! Explain how Nero got Devil Bringer?! All of the above?!

''Looks like they're testing the waters to see if it's worth continuing the series and in which direction.''

DevilMayCry,2pdryf,OnyxMemory,1 point,Tue Dec 16 01:37:02 2014 UTC,The way i see it is... They threw out both DmC to taste on fans and maybe they're expecting some feedback on which they'll want. So which ever game has the more hype/feedback they'll probably make either DmC 2 or DMC 5. God i hope for DMC 5 XD Which is the most logical decision.

DevilMayCry,2pe33i,Kronos616,1 point,Tue Dec 16 17:04:29 2014 UTC,"By 'runs like shit', I mean that compared to other hack-n'-slash games. I'm not gonna compare DmC to The Last of Us or MGS4, because those games had really really good graphics. (MGS4's still wonderful, even after so much time) You're going to get pop-ins, awful loading times and random frame drops just because the game feels like it. Keep in mind I tried running DmC on multiple high-end computers."

I'll have mods link to it in chat if anyone asks any questions. Now I'm wondering if I can have hyperlink text in my stream title...

DevilMayCry,2oe4vc,mastersword130,-1,Fri Dec 19 10:05:00 2014 UTC,I just did and majority of fan also. Seeing how it's the worst selling DMC game we have spoken that it is shit.
DevilMayCry,2oe4vc,Zoiide,2,Fri Dec 19 13:32:19 2014 UTC,"You're talking about your opinion as if it is fact. A lot of people, including myself (a 'hardcore fan' of DMC) liked the game.  Also sales don't mean anything. DmC sold more than Bayonetta, and many people believe Bayonetta to be one of if not the best action game."
DevilMayCry,2oe4vc,mastersword130,0,Sat Dec 20 01:20:09 2014 UTC,That's because bayonetta didn't have a shit ton of advertisement when it first  came out and when DmC sells worse than DMC2 you know your shit stinks.  My opinion is the majority opinion of the game. It is the worst devil may cry game.
DevilMayCry,2oe4vc,Zoiide,2,Sat Dec 20 01:56:53 2014 UTC,"Ah okay, so now you've changed your statement. The reason I corrected you is because you said ""no hardcore DMC fan would like the new game"", which is stupid.  But if you say ""My opinion""... fair enough.   It is the worst devil may cry game.   I still disagree with this. DMC2 was without a doubt worse."
DevilMayCry,2oe4vc,mastersword130,1 point,Sat Dec 20 02:54:07 2014 UTC,"When the majority of ""hard core fans"" share my sentiment then you know its basically a fact.  Dmc2 was shit I give you that but so was DmC. They're both terrible games."

You should just play heavenly sword or demons blade when it comes out if you want games more to that style. Personally I never want the reboot series to continue, dialog was horrible and the gameplay wasn't Devil May Cry to me. Bayonetta was a closer DMC game than DmC"

Dante Must Die is a horrible mode for combo training; if you don't already know, Dante Must Die is Heaven or Hell, except you're the one dying with one hit, and enemies are Very Hard mode difficulty. If you want to train, stick with Hard mode. Not DMD, not Very Hard. Hard. You want your enemies to have a sizable amount of health, but at the same time if you're struggling a lot, you don't want to take loads of damage per hit. Very Hard mode does have the demons with the most health, but you're pretty much 2 hit killed from everything. Also, getting combos depends on the type of weapon too. Stick with the Rebellion. Don't touch the Nevan or the Beowulf weapons. The Nevan is more of a charge type weapon that prevents you from hitting demons for periods of time, but in trade can hit many hard blows, but it can often just keep you stuck in B rank at best. Beowulf hits even harder but is also pretty damn slow except for some select few combos. Cerberus and Agni and Rudra are fair game, not the best, not the worst. They're both odd in their own kind of way. Cerberus is a faster paced Beowulf that takes an annoyingly long time to start new combos directly after you ended one, and Agni and Rudra suffer from the same problems. Again, Rebellion is the best because you can go fucking beserk with it."
DevilMayCry,2k4gc9,GemsRtrulyOutrageous,2,Thu Oct 23 19:20:26 2014 UTC,If you already own DMC4 you should absolutely play it overall it's a better game than DmC especially gameplay wise.

Oh and 2's at the end because even Capcom hated it so decided to just chuck it at the end so it couldn't interfere with the canon timeline."

DevilMayCry,2hjpm7,Bongo_Kong64,12,Fri Sep 26 17:54:54 2014 UTC,"Well, first off, 90% of what you wrote is based on conjecture and hopefulness.  Secondly, Ninja Theory certainly didn't ""give in"" to long-term fans, they, and many reviewers publicly attacked them.  Lastly, I hope you understand that ""old dmc"" was intentionally cheesy, and over the top. I think what many mistake for ""campy"" is truly what the director meant. Motion capture and VA work was often done at Japan headquarters and included on Japanese release, so it was definitely sanctioned.  They even made Reuben Langdon re-audition for DMC4 dante. They kept a close eye on things."
DevilMayCry,2hjpm7,SmokinSickStylish,12,Fri Sep 26 18:23:43 2014 UTC,"No offense OP but your DmC story sucks just as much as the ""new one"" ( I honestly don't think they changed the story as you claim it to be).   Devil May Cry story lore always took a backseat to the combat mechanics and even though you like Ninja Theories combat the rest of us hated it. It was very shallow and by the time you got the angel discs and shotgun you really never needed to use the scythe, hand guns (which are badly designed btw) and the demon knuckles. Angel discs lock enemies, axe is OP and rebellion is a nice filler. You could keep enemies afloat forever with the scythe + roulette and there is no need for color coded enemies nor 2 evade buttons.  Add no lock on to the mix and you got yourself a very shallow combat mechanic system that is little more improved of the heavenly sword mechanics but not by much.   Story wise the game just....well it just left a bad taste in my mouth, What your story suggests OP isn't a devil may cry game. Why would you make a new IP (which is what the story you're making sounds like) and call it Devil May Cry? Why not call it another title and make a new series that can evolve instead of dragging DMC into the muddy?    Blame the fans all you want OP, it just tells you nobody wanted a reboot for Devil May Cry, there was a lot of unanswered questions from DMC4 that needed to be answered before a reboot was every looked at. The series was far from done.   I have no idea where you got the idea that the story was going to be a tryhard gritty game. The first trailer with the whole ""psychosis"" thing was met with bad reception and it was warranted. It wasn't devil may cry, it was a new game with the title slapped on it to sell the game. It didn't work all so well with this ""new"" story you're saying.   Also the series was always cheesy and campy. Look at the spiritual successor Bayonetta, all cheese and campy and that's what people wanted with DMC. A lot of Dante being campy because he is the most powerful being in the universe, he doesn't take a lot of things seriously. When he was serious it was with Mundus and his brother and that's about it."
DevilMayCry,2hjpm7,mastersword130,7,Sat Sep 27 04:37:38 2014 UTC,"Agreed, fans wanted a follow up to DMC4, not a reboot that no one asked for. Sad thing is DmC would've been a decent game on its own, with the DMC franchise. I hope DMC goes back to its roots."
DevilMayCry,2hjpm7,SeymourZ,2,Sun Oct 5 19:31:16 2014 UTC,Yeah decent but I'm not sure it would have sold either. Ninja theory isn't well known for making high selling or in depth games. Their last two games didn't sell either and people also commented how the gameplay was shallow.
DevilMayCry,2hjpm7,mastersword130,3,Sun Oct 5 20:40:32 2014 UTC,"I can agree with most of the comments here. Yes my proposed story is purely conjecture and I can definitely agree that it would have served better as a new series rather than having the DMC label slapped on.   And if they ever get around to continuing the original franchise it would be nice to know just who the hell Nero is? Vergil's son/reincarnation/chosen victim of possession?? They've got a lot of blanks to fill in.   As for the debates about the combat, I've been playing a bit of both of DmC and DMC4 lately, and it's really a toss-up. DMC4 has greater move variety, 5 styles, only 3 devil arms, but the guns are actually useful. (well sorta, E&I have never been good for much except cancelling and juggling).   But the problem I find with DMC4 is that despite all the badass moves at my disposal I rarely get to use half of them. DMC4 suffers from what I like to call the ""cheap-shot enemy syndrome"" where due to unfair design or camera angles you tend to just get blind-sided, a lot. Now experienced players will always chalk this up to a lack of skill, and that may play a part, but it's hard to deny that some enemies in DMC4 are just a total pain in the ass. Fausts and Mephistos on the higher difficulties seem to exist solely to waste your time, make platforming segments impossible, and swipe away half your health bar from off the screen.  DmC is the opposite, combat is slower, arguably less complex and with fewer options. But the thing I notice playing DmC is that I actually use all my moves regularly. Now enemies in DmC are a joke compared to DMC4's (or any previous game in the series), but on the flip-side when I die in DmC I know it's because I saw an attack coming and didn't dodge, or I pushed my luck too far. It feels fair. The game never reaches the punishing difficulty or breakneck speed of the previous games, but it makes you feel powerful from the get-go and gives you some breathing room to pull-off your cool moves.  TL;DR Yes DmC would have been better off as a standalone title rather than an entry in the DMC series. As for the combat, both games have pros/cons."
DevilMayCry,2hjpm7,mastersword130,3,Mon Oct 6 07:44:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah but DmC combat has more cons than pros. You said DMC4 has a cheap shot syndrome which I never experienced since I'm always jumping, dodging and moving. In DmC the enemies make this bit gesture when they attack so there is no need to keep being on your toes.   Also you said you use almost all your moves in DmC which you really shouldn't because of the way the game handles combos, badly. It's worst if you string combos together than just using the big attacks repeatedly, you get a better score if you just use the axe, shotgun, rebellion and the discs. There is no need for the others and that's a big mistakes. You seem to be under the illusion that combos serve a purpose in DmC which they don't unlike the original games.   There is too many problems with the basic gameplay that doesn't fit with a style base game with a score like devil may cry. Too many useless weapons, stances and evades. Seriously, there is no reason to have normal dodge, angel dodge and demon dodge. Too many and only one is actually useful, they rather use 3 dodges instead of making a lock on."
DevilMayCry,2hjpm7,mastersword130,1 point,Mon Oct 6 12:55:24 2014 UTC,"I definitely agree the different dodges were pointless (I don't think I've ever used demon dodge, or even seen what it looks like). I never had any trouble adjusting to the lack of lock on, however. Funny enough, I found that going back to DMC4 after playing DmC actually made me a better player since I wasn't constantly holding R1, but that's just me. Actually the most annoying thing in going back to DMC4 is the lack of the DmC's pulling/whip system. While Nero has the devil bringer to reel in enemies, playing as Dante involves a bit of chasing around. It's not a huge thing, but the easier maneuverability is a definite small improvement that DmC did make.   I can't argue that the combo scoring system is broken in DmC, it probably is and I've never experimented to find out. But I've never applied any number-crunching to DMC games. Hitting SS, SSS is easy enough in all the entries that you can basically use whatever you want. Sure some moves and weapons may get you there faster, but I've been primarily using Osiris and Eryx lately and I'm having no trouble raking in the numbers.   Overall I can see your points. There are some aspects of the combat like dodging, devil trigger, and the scoring system that could have been handled better. But I wouldn't say it's inferior to DMC4 in any way, just different."
DevilMayCry,2hjpm7,mastersword130,2,Mon Oct 6 15:45:48 2014 UTC,"Combat is completely different that it can't be called a devil may cry game and that's where the issues land. There is almost no similarities of the original devil may cry game and the Reboot. Only thing that is somewhat similar is the story and that isn't even the reason people played dmc3 and 4.  I agree with you though that it was hard to play as Dante when I was spoiled by Nero's devil bringer but I got used to it quick. That brings another point, in DmC, Dante is more like Nero in that game from the move set and somewhat personality. I wouldn't be surprised if they thought Nero was Dante and made a character based off him.  All in all I can fully understand why the game failed and it was the combination of the story, dialog and gameplay. It was just way too different from what the fans loved about the series.   Also I would say the gameplay is different in a bad way for this series."
DevilMayCry,2hjpm7,TreyMetal,1 point,Mon Oct 6 15:56:13 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure Ninja Theory did enough homework to know the who's who. But I think the adaptation of some of Nero's moveset into Dante's was just as you said, being that Nero's devil bringer was a useful feature why not keep it and expand it? For the most part though Dante's moves were similar to past iterations, just divided between the different weapons (e.g. Prop Shredder now being in Osiris, Round Trip in Aquila). And the gauntlets, always the same moves with the gauntlets.  Personality-wise...yeah I don't know what the new Dante was supposed to be in the end. Just kinda came off as a a piece of white trash wrapped in a good guy ribbon. I wasn't really rooting for any of the characters in that game.  But I think an important thing that hasn't been brought up is that the story being so radically different from past games was not Ninja Theory's fault. NT had originally planned to make the game more or less like the rest of the series (can't remember if they were told originally to make a reboot). But it was Capcom's insistence that they keep making it more and more radical to appeal to a younger demographic.  And I think that sums up both of our problems with the story right there. The reason the game wasn't a) another entry in the original series with the original characters and b) wasn't a gritty stand-alone title is because of damn kids and their damn pop music! I kid (get it?), but it was all a marketing thing in the end."
DevilMayCry,2hjpm7,mastersword130,5,Mon Oct 6 16:15:37 2014 UTC,"Oh I blame both Capcom and ninja theory equally. One for capcom making stupid decisions like this, I will never get over mega man legends 3, and ninja theory's awful script and subpar gameplay. Ninja theory should have outsourced their writer like they usually did with heavenly sword and enslaved, at least those stories were good.   I have no idea why capcom choose NT really, they do not have a good track record in selling games.  They never proved themselves."

DevilMayCry,2gz932,Adam_Absence,2,Sat Sep 20 21:48:56 2014 UTC,Personally the Succubus' appearance and mannerisims never bothered me. If anything they broke from tradition and what people expect when they hear the word succubus. Besides we already have Nevan in DMC 3 for a more traditional one.   But the Slurm Factory rip off was pretty lazy. They could have done something else and still had their succubus be a huge ugly monster.
DevilMayCry,2gz932,Kiisuke,-2,Sun Sep 21 17:42:58 2014 UTC,"Then they shouldn't call it a succubus at all. The Nephilim thing was already pushing it but since there's been so many video games that get the lore wrong on that as well I decided to ignore it.   All they did was copy the slurm queen and plastered a demons name on it. You're right, it far beyond lazy.   I can never forgive ninja theory for this hack of a writing team."
DevilMayCry,2gz932,mastersword130,-7,Sun Sep 21 18:04:14 2014 UTC,"Yup OP, that's why a lot of us hate the DmC storyline. It's a huge rip off of many other stories and plots. Slum Queen from futurama, They Live, Bayonetta with limbo/purgatory. It's a very badly written story that takes a lot of things from other shows/movies.  Also a succubus is supposed to be a demon that sexual assaults a male in their sleep, what Ninja Theory did here was turn the succubus into the slurm queen like how Stephen Meyers turned Vampires into sparkling fairies.   edit: guess some people don't like it when I call ninja theory out on their hack job of a writing team. Should have outsourced like they did with heavenly sword and enslaved. Dialog and voice acting in those games were miles better. Gameplay was mediocre like always with their games"

DevilMayCry,2gv1qw,mastersword130,5,Fri Sep 19 17:15:23 2014 UTC,"Shit the game was bad with the mechanics as well. Color coded enemies has no place in a devil may cry game.   DmC 2 will most definitely never be made, which personally I'm thanking the universe and fans for, since it was such a bomb.   Hopefully a devil may cry 5 will come out which explains more about Nero. Personally I think he's the son of Vergil since it was heavily hinted and kinda confirmed of the manga that came out after the game which the writer said he wanted that to be the story for the game but didn't have enough time or money."
DevilMayCry,2gv1qw,autowikiabot,1 point,Sat Sep 20 00:40:53 2014 UTC,"Well i don't think the mechanics are bad, they're just easier for new players and it's hella easier to get SSS which i think it's kinda bad. The game is really good but not as a DMC that's my thought. But anyway, i've always been such a hugeee Vergil fan, my cousin and i grew up with DMC so we always had this little fight for whom was better he loves Dante i love Vergil. Now could you please link me to that manga? I had no idea of that. Personally i think somehow Nero adquired Vergil's power since in one of his lines says ''After that day'' So i guess something happened that ''day'' or, as you say, his son, anything would be really cool. My hopes are high for a DMC 5  Oh please DmC 2 you just gotta be greateful that thing is in the past XD"
DevilMayCry,2gv1qw,Danzig_With_Wolves,0,Sat Sep 20 01:02:31 2014 UTC,"This is the graphic Novel that the main writer said that Nero is his son. The guy who wrote the summery of the novel was pretty butthurt about it so he would say differently which you can read in the summery.   The mechanics are bad even if the game wasn't a Devil May Cry game. It's not horrible but it's pretty bad. Here are my major gripes.  There really is no reason for two dodge/evade buttons. The stances alone would have suffice with one dodge easily or just get rid of angel dodge entirely since it served no purpose since the demon dodge was vastly superior since it gave you a buff. Angel weapons fucking suck, against a blue enemy it takes forever to defeat them since they hit like tissue paper. All you really need to do is lock an enemy indefinitely with angel discs and wail on any fuckers that isn't a red monster.  You can juggle an enemy forever as well with the scythe, I killed those dual sword demons by just keep them all the way up in the air for about 5 to 10 minutes, that's just bad. Color coded enemies fucking suck, it has no place in a devil may cry game. Not only does it break up combos but you basically just use your axe until they die since the fists are fucking useless as well. Game really needed a lock on, it was a pain in the ass to try to pull of a sting + trillion stabs and not hit the monster I wanted....it was useless until I killed most airborn creatures. Also like you said it was too fucking easy to pull of SSS, I usually just use the angel discs and pull everyone together and tornado and boom SSS.   The bosses, my fucking god the bosses were just pitiful. Not only they had shitty dialog but they can get torn apart like a wet newspaper, super weak. Doesn't help that everyone time you bring one of their health bars down to yellow or w/e the whole fucking fight stops with no way of skipping to spout their poorly written dialog. Only boss that had a cool entrance was Bob Barker, that was pretty fucking badass but meh.   Those are my issues with the game that had nothing to do with the story which is a whole other mess. Seriously they should have outsourced their writers like they did heavenly sword and enslaved. At least those games, although mediocre as well, had a somewhat passable story. Also...couldn't they hire better voice actors? Dude who voiced Dante sounded like he was drunk and his screams ""ehhh""....well at least it wasn't as terrible as Vergil's downfall."

I'm not sure about the console release, but the fact that you can rebind both controller and keyboard commands however you like made the game a lot easier to get used to. It can also run at 1080p 144Hz, which is pretty nice.   I've only played through 3/4 of DMC 3 so I can't speak for the series, but the newest DMC stands among other great games like Bayonetta and MGS: Rising imo.   I'm not too far in but it seems to have the advanced tools to make combos very interesting, arguably more so than MGS: Rising.  I'm not sure what the exact terms are for them but here're some I've noticed:   Buster Charge: I call it that because it's like what Zero players do in Ultimate Marvel VS Capcom 3. You can hold the Gun button down to charge Ebony and Ivory while you are doing moves with Rebellion and at least Osiris. There're also certain windows after moves with Rebellion that you can get the gun charge without even bringing Ebony and Ivory out. I'm not sure exactly when it is but its near the end of the attack animation that you can start charging.  Weapon Switch Offset: Similar to dodge offset in MGS and Bayonetta, switching weapons mid string allows you to finish the combo string of the weapon you switched to: EX: Y Y with Rebellion, pause and switch to Arbiter for the third Y and you will get Trinity Smash with Arbiter, without having to go through the slow ass first two hits with the axe Instant Drop: I think this one's pretty well known, but at a certain height above the ground, the Arbiter Tremor attack (creates the red fault line and launches) can be done instantly, as in Dante drops straight down, without doing the first part of the animation. I think maybe you have to do the Ariel Flush into Tremor near the ground to get it consistently but you can also do Inverse Rainstorm> Evade> Tremor and it'll usually instant drop.    Speaking of which,   Inverse Rainstorm (IRS) Evade: Inverse Rainstorm lets you instantly air evade in place if you do it fast enough after the inputs for IRS. It lets you instant drop like i mentioned and can also be really useful in keeping close to enemies while staying safe.    The classic DMC stuff is still there. Jump Canceling is definitely dumbed down in terms of timing, when I stopped playing DMC 3, I was just getting the hang of JC'ing but in the new DMC, it's already part of my combos.  Rake with Osiris and even just the normal Y attack have HUGE windows to be jump canceled. JC'ing Helm Breaker and Arbiter moves are a bit tougher but still pretty easy and the fact that  hooking with either Angelic or Demonic lets you JC instantly takes away any need to plan air combos out.   I haven't gotten the any other weapons besides Osiris and Arbiter so how those play out will determine my final impression of the game but so far it's been a blast.   TL:DR; it's a pretty great game so far, and it's got some fun ass nerd shit in it that even non-nerds can do. and that makes it FUN."
DevilMayCry,2ge80f,mastersword130,2,Thu Sep 18 08:02:44 2014 UTC,"It's an alright mediocre game but a bad devil may cry game. Combat is very shallow from what you would expect from a ninja theory game and the platforming is super easy (again what you would expect). It really does have a lot of problems in its own right that has nothing to do with devil may cry title.  If they named the game ""Nephilim blade"" and still had the same story but the characters had different names it still would be a mediocre game compared to 3 and 4 which is mostly why people like me are pissed off at it.   Game is very broken with weapons. Keep rebellion, use axe only for red enemies and keep using angel discs to lock enemies. There really is no use for the fists or scythe unless you want to keep an enemy juggling forever then use the scythe and just use y,y, pause, y and angel pull and do the same thing. Enemies wouldn't even touch you, combine that with color coded enemies that break combos so you're forced to only use your demon weapons is not what devil may cry is about. Angel weapons are very weak so blue enemies take even long to kill if you don't have the angel discs to lock the assholes down indefinitely while you use wail on them. No lock on is a big issue that some people brush off but without a lock on I basically never use stinger or Trillion stabs unless there's only one enemy on the screen because it always chooses someone I don't want to attack. Overdrive is also op  and there really is no point of two evades. One button would have suffice and only had them triggered by demon/normal/angel with the triggers, one button could have been lock on. Boggles my mind on how the developers even though of that nightmare up.  My main reason I hate the game is the dialog, seriously I couldn't stand it. Bob Baker was the only cool thing about it. I wish ninja theory outsourced a writer like they did with enslaved and heavenly sword because this just cements the idea to me that not only are they mediocre game developers but they can't write a story for shit.   Gameplay wise I give the game a 7/10 and I'm being generous really. It just fails as a devil may cry game. It reminds me of the reboot to robocop that left me angry and confused because Gary Oldmen was in it and I was expecting more...it was just soo mediocre"

But they removed Dante's personality and made his guns overpowered. You can kill most enemies by keeping your distance and wearing a hole in your square button.  It does have some cool enemy designs and bosses, but the challenge is gone, Dante's attitude is gone and we get a lot of screen time invested in a character that isn't very interesting at all."

DevilMayCry,29u0l6,itsachickenwingthing,4,Sat Jul 5 00:48:18 2014 UTC,"The biggest reason is that it was made by completely different people because Capcom wanted a sequel. The original director wasn't even told that there was going to be a sequel.  The soft-lock is redundant and far too aggressive. Even though they kept the lock-on button, Dante will constantly target enemies and objects from feet away. There was at least one section I can remember where you have to hit this object to activate a door, but there were also a bunch of infinitely spawning flying enemies that would be given priority, and so I spent forever trying to target the object.  Replacing pause combos with direction combos. Makes no sense and makes targeting specific targets even more of a pain.  Combat is just generally slower. Hangtime just feels too long. All of the other games are just a lot snappier and responsive.  Alternate weapons aren't functionally distinct. You're basically stuck with the same move set the whole game through.  Bosses aren't that great. A lot of them are airborn or highly elevated, which would be great if they had actually expanded Dante's aerial moveset. Devil Trigger works fine, but it's difficult to maintain meter. And so, you spam the guns and die from boredom."

Well one day he complained of black lines appearing in his game and random shadows... So I came out and check it out. Everything hardware seemed fine,  so I opened up the case and saw all the cords had magically become un-zip tied and we're shoved wherever... I noticed the wedged cord and pulled it out. It spun up and all that after it was reorganized,  but the damage was done. The card died like 2 months later. Luckily we were able to RMA it and get a refurbished one.

DevilMayCry,26ojt8,SmokinSickStylish,1 point,Wed May 28 11:27:19 2014 UTC,i think she basically likes all the ones for the ps2

DevilMayCry,26ojt8,SmokinSickStylish,1 point,Thu May 29 11:09:23 2014 UTC,"Good questions to start with smokinsickstylish. You'll probably want to consider the basics, though:  Food: check pinterest for recipes and ideas about snacks and desserts that could be themed around the games. You might get some good ideas from Halloween boards, etc. Decorations: goes along with venue (see below) but you want to get things that make your venue feel like you're in the video game...or at least an area reminiscent of it Stripper: costume = KEY!!! Venue: is there a way to decorate the venue thematically around the games? Invitations: should obviously feature either Dante or her favorite character Music: theme music from the games is likely available somewhere on the internet Favors: something unexpected, but fun/funny  Miscellaneous: maybe utensils that look like the weapons in game?  Just some basic starting points! Sounds like a great idea! Have fun and feel free to ask any questions!"

DevilMayCry,2597zu,Vergil387,7,Sun May 11 03:17:54 2014 UTC,You're trolling right? You know Dante's inferno is based off of the Divine Comedy right? It was written centuries ago.
DevilMayCry,2597zu,Gavininator,-3,Sun May 11 14:33:33 2014 UTC,No Im not trolling thank you very much. But even though the book came out first the game came out last and you said it yourself that it was first a book. So therefore it was EA intention to mock Devil May Cry one way or another. also it cant be just a coincidence that they made it into a hack and slash game
DevilMayCry,2597zu,lawliet1979,4,Sun May 11 18:50:08 2014 UTC,"It was EA's intention to take an ancient peloem, divine comedy, and make it a game. Besides that they weren't mocking dmc, if anything they were mocking god of war. When I played Dante's inferno it pissed me off how it played the exact same as God of war."
DevilMayCry,2597zu,lawliet1979,0,Fri May 16 02:39:16 2014 UTC,i kinda feel the same way towards god of war with Kratos's appearance. a straight up knockoff of Quan Chi from Mortal Kombat.  speaking of knockoff last year i took a trip down memory lane and i just notice that the new Dante from DMC: Devil May Cry is a knockoff of Raziel from Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver

DevilMayCry,215rcj,mr-mercer,1 point,Sun Apr 6 14:38:36 2014 UTC,"I think he's  more realistic.  Old dante is very anime like and everything he says or does goes along the lines of a badass character without a lot of depth. When he is killing demons, he has fun with it. The new dante is a bit more relatable in terms of the way he acts. When he fights demons, it's way more about his hatred for them. Hence why a lot of his one liners are more spiteful than playful"

DevilMayCry,20e3oh,Vergil387,10,Fri Mar 14 09:33:44 2014 UTC,"I think it could go either way.  If Nero is Dante's nephew, it would make sense Dante saying the Yamato should stay in the family, giving it to Nero for safekeeping.  But when Nero first awakens the Yamato, it seems more like Vergil's spirit is manifesting itself in Nero's devil trigger.  ""POWER! I need more POWER!""  Also I've heard (and have no source) that the similarity between Nelo Angelo's and Nero's names is a coincidence."
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,Chuck357,7,Fri Mar 14 12:06:41 2014 UTC,"true. but i think its more than a coincidence cause ""Nero"" means black in italian and Nelo Angelo (who was Vergil) i'm guessing was supposed to mean ""Black Angel"" which thats exactly what he resembled in the first one.  and lets not forget that Devil May Cry is a japanese franchise. and japanese do flip the L and the R a lot"
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,SeymourZ,5,Fri Mar 14 20:03:30 2014 UTC,"I'd love to hear an origin for Nero. Also, did he always have the devil arm, or did it heal that way after he injured it? I'd also love for Capcom to pick the story up following the events of dmc 4, and drop the reboot. Bring back Classic Dante!   Edit: just read about about the devil bringer, nvrmnd"
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,SeymourZ,2,Sat Mar 15 06:54:03 2014 UTC,"i doubt they would do that. dropping the reboot, since the reboot already succeeded and had a better storyline. but did you beat DMC: Devil May Cry?"
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,SeymourZ,4,Sat Mar 15 08:01:32 2014 UTC,"I did, working through on SOS mode now. It's a great game, but found the reboot unnecessary. People seem to love or hate it. I like that it's an origin story, but greatly prefer Classic Dante to Emo Dante. No complaints about the gameplay though. Solid. If the reboot does continue, I hope we see Dante evolve into the character who made the series great for us."
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,mitakamizi,1 point,Sat Mar 15 13:54:28 2014 UTC,his hair did turn white after he beat Virgil as he awaken his demon power further. So that should hint you out that he is going to involve into the classic Dante later on
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,mitakamizi,1 point,Sat Mar 15 20:15:49 2014 UTC,"I hope they ffwd it. Maybe skip 5 or 10 years and get right to it. Actually, I'd settle for confirmation on the next games release date...or even confirmation it's happening. I don't want to wait another 6 years for a sequel."
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,mr-mercer,1 point,Sat Mar 15 23:00:03 2014 UTC,that is most likely what's going to happen remember that he is a nephelim  not a human. So he obviously ages different. Either that or he could go through something similar to anakin skywalker the day he became darth vader
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,mr-mercer,3,Sat Mar 15 23:48:31 2014 UTC,how? the classic Dante practically never had an origin story. the classic devil may cry never gave as much details as dmc: devil may cry

DevilMayCry,20e3oh,Jcorb,2,Sun May 18 23:58:09 2014 UTC,that wont stop his attitude and personality to shift into that of the classic Dante. looking at the bright side he could become more powerful than the classic Dante since  both angels and demons are powerful immortal beings
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,SmokinSickStylish,1 point,Mon May 19 22:39:39 2014 UTC,"I don't see how his power level is relevant. You asked why false Dante can never become classic Dante, and I gave you a logical answer: the simple matter of species. The point of a character like Dante is that they are at least somewhat human."
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,Chuck357,1 point,Mon May 19 23:12:09 2014 UTC,hey but he was raised by humans and he still resembles a human fair enough. remember when he had that conversation with Kat about the time he actually found out he wasnt human because he tried to kill himself but couldnt?
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,SmokinSickStylish,1 point,Sun Apr 6 14:41:03 2014 UTC,New Dante cannot physically become classic Dante. But his personallity can become the same which i think is what he was trying to say.
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,Watty162,1 point,Tue Apr 8 00:36:44 2014 UTC,Better story is up for debate but it was successfully. No facts but I do remember reading it sold way more than they thought it would. Again could be wrong.
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,mastersword130,-1,Wed Apr 9 16:38:15 2014 UTC,oh yea and the soundtrack was a lot better too. i think Combichrist and Noisia's work was out of this world
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,Watty162,3,Thu Apr 10 03:05:40 2014 UTC,And Sanctus saying Nero had a connection with Sparda.
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,mastersword130,5,Fri May 16 02:47:10 2014 UTC,"Personally, I think Nero is the reincarnation of Sparda (note how he wears the exact same colors, just a more modern style). Vergil wound up possessing him arm (perhaps unwittingly so), and if the story was allowed to continue, I think we would eventually see Vergil regaining corporeal form, while also finding out that Nero inherited Sparda's own power.  I think the series being cut-short is what led to that employee making the remark of Nero being Vergil's son; because they knew there wouldn't be another game to explain everything, so they just tried to ""wrap it up"" posthumously."
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,Watty162,5,Mon Mar 17 18:18:10 2014 UTC,"Nero is Vergil's son.  *is there a reason I was downvoted? Feel free to challenge me on this, I've got backup."
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,mastersword130,1 point,Fri May 16 02:48:55 2014 UTC,"I didn't downvote, but it's probably because you should have backed up your claim before being asked to do so.  It just adds more to the discussion than just stating a ""fact.""  Good luck! (Also I am interested in hearing your ideas)"
DevilMayCry,20e3oh,Watty162,3,Fri Apr 11 08:45:06 2014 UTC,"It's not up for debate, it's an established fact in canon  http://devilmaycry.wikia.com/wiki/Devil_May_Cry_4:_Deadly_Fortune  It's the novellization by the Capcom scenario writer."
DevilMayCry,1zm3mr,blitzballer,1 point,Wed Mar 5 09:12:15 2014 UTC,"info;  Although it has not been explicitly explained how Nero received the Devil Bringer, there is an Order of the Sword report stating that Nero received an injury to his shoulder before the events of the game.  According to Nero after aquiring Yamato, ""From that day forth, (his) arm changed, and a voice echoed 'Power, give me more power' "".  Anyone have any theories/ideas?"
DevilMayCry,1zm3mr,RavenicusPrime,5,Wed Mar 5 09:12:42 2014 UTC,"I'm kind of hoping they just go back to the old DMC storyline, since I really wanted to see this answered. Most of the hints seem to point towards a meeting with Vergil or some relation, and many of the enemies in the game have names hinting towards Vergil."
DevilMayCry,1zm3mr,treeogre66,2,Wed Mar 5 13:05:12 2014 UTC,"I read somewhere that Nero is Vergil's son. The brother's are 19, I believe, in DMC3. Dante is 29 in DMC and so on in the anime, DMC4 and DMC2. It's entirely possible that Vergil conceived Nero before the events of DMC3. Following the timeline, Nero would be in his late teens by DMC4, and would also explain why yamato was resurrected. I think Dante may have known this because he gives yamato to Nero, after saying he wanted to 'Keep it in the family'."
DevilMayCry,1zm3mr,Chaz-Osgiliath,2,Wed Mar 12 05:21:28 2014 UTC,"can confirm, when working on the game Johnny Young Bosh [the voice of Nero] was told Nero was the son of Vergil. i honestly didn't want to believe him when he told me that while at a convention getting some DMC4 stuff signed"
DevilMayCry,1zcb0i,blu300,2,Sun Mar 2 12:27:13 2014 UTC,"You've gotta keeping in mind the difference between simply block & releasing, and royal blocks & releases. Time the block or release to be just as an enemy attack is about to connect; royal blocks will make you effectively invincible, while royal releases will let you deal massive damage.  The trick to really devastating royal releases is to charge up the so-called rage meter. Pay attention to the green orbs next to the health meter. They'll start blinking as you block attacks, and then become fully illuminated after a few blocks. You can kill most enemies in a single strike with all three orbs in the meter illuminated. Even an uncharged royal release will at least stagger most enemies."
DevilMayCry,1zcb0i,itsachickenwingthing,2,Sun Mar 2 21:27:25 2014 UTC,"Also, if you time the frames perfectly, if you release while sustaining the hit, you will accomplish a ""Just Release"" and hurt that enemy back with some multiplier and take no damage.  IIRC you do like a semi trickster dash but its just the Royal Guards release.  So if you're facing a tough enemy and know its patterns, build up charge by blocking, then just release and deal MASSIVE damage."
DevilMayCry,1zcb0i,Chaotix247,1 point,Mon Mar 3 03:43:35 2014 UTC,"timing your release is also important. basically, you want to time your release just before you get hit. the closer the timing is, the greater the damage, (risk/reward.) you can tell how full your gauge is by the 3 orbs by the health meter, (they will glow brighter the more full the gauge is.)"
DevilMayCry,1z1fq5,MetroidAndZeldaFan,13,Thu Feb 27 00:16:19 2014 UTC,"They were pretty big when they came out.  Have fun with 3, it's fantastic.  It's a prequel to 1, and it's a bit more frantic and difficult. They slowed things back down (by comparison) in 4, but the combat is smoother than ever.  The reboot's combat is just plain outstanding."
DevilMayCry,1z1fq5,AJockeysBallsack,3,Thu Feb 27 00:59:58 2014 UTC,"Right. DmC looks great. But just a question, why did they ""reboot"" the franchise? From my understanding, a reboot typically happens when a franchise died off and a company wants to restart(reboot) it--kind of like what Ubisoft did with Prince of Persia. Devil May Cry was still pretty fresh since DMC 4 is on the same console. I feel like I would consider DmC, ""Devil May Cry 5""."
DevilMayCry,1z1fq5,Chaotix247,4,Thu Feb 27 01:26:11 2014 UTC,"No one knows.  It never died.  So I don't understand.  The reboot was okay, I personally still hate it, but it's okay.  Combat is definitely not as depth as previous games.  All weapons use the same combo input, some enemies can only be hurt by demon/angel weapons (with a trigger defining what is angel and what is devil), and the bosses are not intriguing except the final boss."
DevilMayCry,1z1fq5,Trunksshe,3,Thu Feb 27 04:41:40 2014 UTC,"I heard it was more about CAPCOM not wanting to do the series anymore than anything, hence giving it to Ninja Theory."

DevilMayCry,1yzey8,mastershake04,2,Wed Feb 26 12:14:49 2014 UTC,"Pre-patch, demon evade gave a ridiculous power boost that stacked on top of the power boost in Devil Trigger, but it's not necessary. If you can find a way to work it into your play style then it can help, but I'd say angel evade is far more useful at this point.  As far as the Butcher, guns don't damage him IIRC. They're those types of enemies where you can really only get in a few attacks before they counter you and you don't really have any way of stunning them. Keep your distance so that they can only use their projectile attacks (which are broadcasted and give you more time to dodge), and then use a combination of Overdrive, Round Trip, and Flush to deal damage to them. Alternatively, you can go in with the Arbiter and get in one or two hits and then dodge back out of the way.  If you were talking about the Kabloeey, the thing you need to learn to use is gun specials. The default control scheme on consoles isn't very intuitive when it comes to the input for gun special (jump+shoot), so I just remap it to Dodge 2 (RB). There are a couple of things to keep in mind with the third gun: 1) You can only have six live darts at a time with all the upgrades, 2) you can manually detonate all of the darts you've fired by pressing Gun Special, 3) when an enemy is killed, all of the undetonated darts on them will detonate, 4) the damage and area-of-effect from detonations stacks with each dart, so if you embed six darts into a single enemy, detonating them will do massive damage and probably stun them, 5) plastering a fodder enemy with darts, using Buy-In to bring a mob close to that enemy, and then detonating will give you massive area-of-effect damage.  Ebony & Ivory are basically pea-shooters. Rainstorm does decent damage, and a fully charged Ricoshot has its uses. The Revenant is a little more useful if you know how to get around its slow rate of fire. Fireworks, its gun special, is pretty useful in the middle of a mob. I've never found a use for its charge shot.  Search for some tutorials on animation cancelling techniques such as jump cancelling. It's one of the main things that makes the Revenant and Kabloeey useful, among other things. If you haven't already, try swapping pause combos between the different weapons, e.g. use the first two hits with Rebellion's Hacker combo, switch to Arbiter during the pause, then combo into Trinity Smash.

DevilMayCry,1yzey8,kamaitachi96,2,Wed Feb 26 20:38:23 2014 UTC,"how to complete DmC 1 on ANY difficulty:  1.Jump up 2.Demon grapple enemy to you 3. sword attack, sword attack, wait 1 sec, sword attack 4. Angel grapple to enemy 5. Repeat 6. Gradually get higher and higher whilst no enemies can attack you.  tada, the only issue might be the drekavac which can be killed with a charged shotgun shot when they leave their portals (takes a few)  also the kablooey gun only detonates when you press A + B or something in at the same time :)"

DevilMayCry,1ysh8c,Vergil387,5,Fri Mar 14 10:32:43 2014 UTC,"I was really hoping to see a bit more character development from the Reboot. I actually could imagine the disgruntled douche bag developing into more of a wise cracking stoic Han solo analog who masked his pain in humor like the original Dante. In other words I was holding out hope that the Reboot would develop the character more so by the end he was closer to the person we know. Particularly seeing he hair turn completely white at the end seemed to reinforce this idea.  It still somewhat possible if they continue the alternate timeline to flesh out the character but I doubt it. Unfortunately, I was holding out hope that the DLC was going to involve more development that was going to be meaningful. However the DLC was total tripe and really is where the reboot pissed me off because it sealed the deal that the plot was irredeemable. On the other hand Mundus in the reboot was a great character in my opinion. Meh...  Of course the gameplay could have been fine tuned for a DMC game but over all the reboot was not as bad as people claim."

DevilMayCry,1xpmpj,BigDun,3,Wed Feb 12 15:07:32 2014 UTC,"I have of a lot of thought into this so fair warning, it's a long one;  First as far as the angels go, I don't know about you guys but the absolute only Angel that is seen, referenced,  or even mentioned is Dante's mother Eve. On top of that to make matters slightly more confusing is the fact that u fight countless angelic demons, or rather Angel based demons that can only be attacked with the angel weapons, so what r these things because Dante is half demon, half Angel being nephilim but these r mainly demon but are also part Angel? I mean it can be argued that they're ice based demons that for some reason fire isn't their weakness, areal based angelic based weapons that have no ice properties which also does not make much sense, for the whole angelic weapons only rule to work they would have to be actually part Angel which then wouldn't that make them technically a lesser form of nephilim, or could they alternatively be Angels disguised as demons to survive in this dual parallel world that the demons have created which would put a morbid twist on them being forced to fight and die by Dante's hand when they should be allies, idk if anyone has true clarification of this let me know because I am at a loss in the midst of all this  Also as far as the whole limbo thing goes, I think limbo is mainly a camouflage si that the henchmen demons can operate and control and influence the influence without them seeing the fact that their demons, this causing the fact that Mundus note any of the other informant guys that cry blood and yell ""Daanteee!!!!"" Can only exist in the human world as human bodies that r weak and frail allowing Mundus to be killed by killing Kyle Ryder's body, which I believe this rule them becomes null and void when the hell gate is destroyed and limbo and reality became one in the same all demons were dumped into the human world which may or may not have caused these disguised demons to revert back to their demonic forms, I don't know these were some vague concepts even thoughn they had a good deal of influence in the story"
DevilMayCry,1xpmpj,GoTrunks_Armada,3,Thu Feb 13 23:47:55 2014 UTC,"From what it looks like; the Angels lost and are holding back. Considering how far the demons have corrupted the human world...it would seem they won.  As far as Limbo goes, I think both Angels/Demons can use Limbo but since the Angels are hiding/defeated. And they aren't powerless, they choose to hide their abilities to continue the corruption/control of humans (note Mundus when he hits Dante/shoots that wave during the trade."

I was just curious, how did you get the lost soul thats way high in the air in Mission 11?  (when you first encounter a dreamwalker).    I couldn't get that one forever and when I watched a couple guides it showed them using Eryx's uppercut and then grappling the dreamwalker, jumping, and boosting over to the soul.  I couldn't get it with that strategy and finally I realized I could just use my devil trigger when the dreamwalker was right under the soul, then grapple up, jump, and get it.

DevilMayCry,1vezhy,NewLimits,5,Fri Jan 17 02:38:27 2014 UTC,"It's parallel AFAIK.  Kinda like the Matrix.  You can ""exist"" in both worlds, but you can only do your superpower stuff in one.  Dante and Virgil are special cases due to being demon/human hybrids. For the Barbas example, Dante weakened him in Limbo, then crossed over and finished him off in the real world.   I'd also like to add that this game got way too much flak.  I think it's mainly because Dante isn't as much of a fun-loving, wise-cracking, ass-kicking hero he was previously.  I wouldn't say he's ""emo"" (like the Internet community ranted about when the game released), just not as likeable.  He's more of an anti-hero. The only time you really see his heroic side IMO is when he's fighting for Kat and against Virgil. The only sympathy is when he's learning about his mother and the circumstances around her death.   Anyway, if you're looking to try out the rest of the series, stick with 3 and 4.  Get 3's Special Edition if you can it was a shitty port for PC, but it will probably be better for PS+.  Be warned, it's fucking hard.  4 is easier, annd the combat is smooth like DmC.  Not quite as refined, but still better than the previous 3. Nero (main character) is pretty neat, but the real fun is playing as Dante. He's more of an ass-kicking smartass than ever, and his moveset and combo abilities are nearly on par with DmC. Some of his weapons are very unique and have a high learning curve, but are very rewarding once you get the hang of them.   Also, fuck dreamrunners."

Like the Hunter demon knocking down the ferris wheel, the whole city crumbling in missions is just cause limbo looks different I geuss. Limbo is the demon realm, I remember Phineas talking about nephalims being able to easily travel through realms so it made them dangerous. I don't think they ever mentioned anything about an angel realm, so it's basically the human world which can't see limbo, and limbo filled with demons fucking over the humans. The only time we ever see Dante or Vergil using their  powers in the human realm is Dante's rebellion tattoo healing his scratches. I think that Vergil got through security using Yamato at one point, but we never saw if it did anything."

DevilMayCry,1uio5b,laterolus,3,Mon Jan 6 07:02:53 2014 UTC,"I would start with DMC 1 to get a taste of what DMC is all about.   I believe DMC 2 was an attempt to boost sales by making the game easier. great game, but it is a cousin of DMC that doesn't share quite the same blood due to it's ease and added bells and whistle  DMC 3 brought the series back towards the classic DMC with it's increased difficulty. dante was more of the original dante in the sense that he was a fast talking, wise ass, rather than DMC 2's brooding, laconic dante.   DMC 4 was amazing and the closest thing to being an updated classic DMC.  so to appreciate the series for what it's worth, start playing from the first. the second is optional because it strays from the classic DMC formula. then play the third and forth.   don't couple the reboot together with the rest of the DMC. it really is a game on it's own. try the reboot only after you've at least played DMC 1 and 3/4"
DevilMayCry,1uio5b,averytheninja,2,Wed Jan 8 22:36:44 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, the absolute best game mechanically and storywise is the very vanilla Devil May Cry 1, none of the other games even came close to how epic it felt to me. 2nd sucks ass, 3rd is all about mechanics and no story (imo) and 4th is pretty solid. As for the DmC series, I liked it very much, it comes close to the first game in story and depth and the visual eyeporn is impossible to get bored of.  All in all, I would say the original first still beats all the other games, but that's because I invested a lot more time and thought into the game so it became my sacred relic. DmC is the first game since then that actually gave that feeling back, all the other ones in between have just been kind of ""meh"".  I think that starting with DmC will ruin your experience with the first 3 games though, since it puts a lot into the visual side, and the first game can come across as very dull in comparison. My advice is to start from the beginning, and if you don't really enjoy hack'n'slash skip the second game, cause the story is really lacking there. DmC is a really good game, and I recommend you play it, just try to be smart about it and not let it highten your standars to the sky, or the first ones will seem less good than they really are."

It of course doesn't have the deep combo system of 3/4, but it does give you it's own tools to deal with the situations at hand. The game has the best atmosphere in the series, but the camera 'can' feel pretty archaic at times. Chock this down to being meant as an early Resident Evil game.

DevilMayCry,1u285x,averytheninja,1 point,Wed Jan 8 22:41:02 2014 UTC,"Unlike everyone ever, I actually really enjoyed DMC 2, it seemed difficult, had a peculiarly interesting story line and some really cool bosses.  DMC 1, is great too, for all of the right reasons, which everyone else on this sub will defend and explain.  But in all honesty, I enjoyed DMC4 more than the other ones."
DevilMayCry,1u285x,Trunksshe,1 point,Wed Jan 1 00:31:35 2014 UTC,"With all due respect, DMC2 didn't even have a coherent storyline. It was a collection of ideas thrown and stitched together right at the end of the development. The game was more or less sightseeing as you walk around big empty levels while seemingly random things just happen. How you get from one level to the next doesn't even make sense half the time. The combat was butchered and stiff as hell with the combo system changed to pushing the left analog stick in a direction every other sword attack. The boss fights were pretty ridiculous as well, with some of them where you can actually do nothing other than spamming your guns.  As for the difficulty, no, it was not difficult whatsoever. The only thing difficult about the game was trying to keep you style meter to stay active for more than five second. Don't even get me started on the characterization, there was none. Dante is a mostly silent husk and maybe has 15 lines in the game tops. Lucia is even worse, and her accent was all over the place as well.  The only redeeming factors for the game was that Dante and his devil trigger had some pretty badass designs here. It also probably had the best DMC soundtrack."

DevilMayCry,1u285x,Xolcin,1 point,Tue Jan 14 07:22:34 2014 UTC,DMC 1 is good but I'm not a huge fan. DMC 2 is garbage.
DevilMayCry,1twxgh,BVTheEpic,8,Sun Dec 29 02:06:57 2013 UTC,"4 is pretty fun. Standard original DMC fare. I did like the DT in DMC 4 more than the original. The story is also very original DMC like. Big bad demon, redemption-esque story, except you're not Dante. You sure as hell look like Dante and there has to be some connection there. I enjoyed it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's nothing new when it came out. It is a ""safe"" game that doesn't step outside of the perceived DMC boundaries.   I, honestly, enjoyed the reboot more than DMC 4. This may be because I was older when I played DmC so I had a better grasp of the game and its nuisances. I played DMC4 in I think, 2010 or somewhere around there. I bought DmC on release date. I did, however, revisit DMC4 for a short period of time when I got bored of my mainstay games. DmC is better than DMC4 because I feel like DmC Dante is a much stronger protagonist than Nero. Both are ""redemption stories"", but Dante's story has more substance. Dante goes from someone who didn't give a shit about anybody to someone who holds the world on his shoulder. I didn't get that sense off Nero.   If I had a choice, I'd go with DmC because its a new flavor in the DMC lineup. Dante's reboot is pretty fucking cool. He's foulmouthed, he's angry, he's misunderstood, and he's disenfranchised in a shitty world. The colors and level design are impeccable. Limbo is pretty fucking beautiful. Story's themes parallel our world's themes and woes."
DevilMayCry,1twxgh,TheCoxer,3,Sun Dec 29 06:56:40 2013 UTC,"4 is fun, but be aware that it's not like the previous 3 (especially 3) in speed,  handling, and difficulty.  Dante is a co-star rather than main character.  Nero (the star) only has one fighting style, and the game is tailored to him.  There are platforming areas that can be maddening, and it's just because they want you to use Nero's grappling arm.  It's artificial difficulty.   Halfway in, you backtrack as Dante through most of Nero's bosses and areas.  Dante's style-swapping fluidity is MASSIVELY improved from the previous games, allowing more combo possibilities for massive damage.  This is where the Nero-tailoring can be a pain.  Since the combat is slightly slower, chaining these wicked combos can actually put you in more danger than they're worth.  That just strikes me as nerfing.  The added fluidity is almost wasted completely if you don't get decent at move cancelling in combos.  If it wasn't, you would wreck shit so hard with Dante that playing with Nero would be a drag.  Nero's kind of a whiny bitch, so any more strikes against him would just kill the game.   As or the reboot, you have to look at it exactly as that; expect big changes. It's a bit darker, Dante isn't as happy-go-lucky (he actually comes off as an asshole from time to time), and it's...dirty? I can't think of a good way to put it. I liked the combat better than 4 though. They managed to improve the style fluidity even more, and the weapons are really satisfying when you pull of the good stuff.   They mostly got rid of areas and enemies that punish you for no reason. If it's super-difficult, odds are you'll get something rad; a weapon or a big piece of the story.  That said, having a less-charismatic Dante makes the story less appealing.   Overall, 4 is better IMO.   Turbo edit -  don't pay more than $5-$10 for 4.  It's almost 6 years old.  Reboot can likely be found for $15 or less."

It the perfect amount of badassery and cheesiness.  One of my favorite conversations with a certain boss...  ""Fuck you Dante""  ""No Fuck you.*  ""FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU """
DevilMayCry,1twxgh,EvilGrandpa,4,Wed Jan 29 09:49:56 2014 UTC,"If you liked the first three, you'll like 4 almost certainly, there's a new protagonist with a totally new style of fighting but you can also still play as Dante and switch styles on the spot (as opposed to 3 when if you wanted to change your style you had to do so in the menu before the missions). The story is standard DMC, bosses are pretty fun and I think Dante has the best gameplay of any game in the series.  As for the reboot, I personnaly didn't like it very much, it's still a good beat'em all though, it's easier than it's predecessor and gameplay wise not as good as 4 or 3 (but if you weren't big on making high scores combos and all these crazy shit like jump cancel, you won't really see a difference), the game also runs in 30fps as opposed to 60fps in 4 (but again, if you're not a crazy combo guy you won't see a big difference). I wasn't a big fan of the story or the characters, but that's more a matter of opinion I think, weapons I think were okay even though I didn't like most of their designs (and the whip thingy is pretty much a copy of Nero's devil bringer from DMC4) and the angel/demon duality replacing the different styles I didn't like (especially being forced to use one type of weapon against some ennemies). I'm not a big fan of the pace of the game too, it's pretty much room with ennemies, some platforming (that can be really bad sometimes because of the camera) and room with ennemies again, I would have appreciated some puzzle like in previous game to break away from the action from time to time but again, that's just me. And finally I really didn't like the monsters designs, boss fights I found very lacking (it's pretty much find the weak spot and hit it 3 time, on every boss), I didn't like the music very much except one or two from Combichrist and just to show that I don't hate everything about this game, the level design was really good and really unique and cool looking.  Also if you like character action games, I would highly recommend Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance both were done by Platinum Games, the original creators of the Devil May Cry series and both are phenomenal games.  I hope that helped you. :)"

Nevan has a couple of distinct advantages. For one, it probably offers the best crowd control out of all the weapons. Next is that you get a bit of a summoned swords equivalent with the lightning ball attacks if you know how to queue them up right, giving you great stun and juggling potential. Finally, most of Nevan's moves have long animations, which normally makes you a sitting duck if you can't guard cancel, but they generally have a large enough area of effect to stop enemies from attacking you and you can use the animations to buffer for other moves, especially crazy combos."

DevilMayCry,1ol2w5,ThePurpleGhost,3,Wed Oct 16 20:14:01 2013 UTC,"DMC, the reboot, is a solid game, don't feel discouraged to get it because some fans might not like it. As someone new to the series, you're more apt to enjoy it than others, I'd think. That beings said, get DMC4. Its plays pretty swell on PC and the graphics hold up very well."
DevilMayCry,1ol2w5,HighlordSmiley,1 point,Wed Oct 23 04:37:04 2013 UTC,"A bit late but...   DMC4 is an amazing port and has a PC only difficulty where the game throws tons of enemies at you. Definitely worth it  I like DMC 3 the best out of the series but the PC port is pretty crappy. But since you don't have access to ps3 or 360, you can make it work. Or depending on how good your PC is you can use PCSX2 to emulate the PS2 version (and if it's good enough to upscale you can make it look as good as the HD version on ps3/xbox).   As for DmC, it's a blacksheep of the DMC family but I enjoyed it. Just go into it knowing the story is cheesy and it isn't as indepth combat wise as 3 and 4.  As for the order, really it should be 3-1-4-DmC. But since 1 was never ported try 3-DmC-4.  Just be aware that there are a few story changes with Dante's character in the reboot and control changes that may throw you off. I would say to do 3-4-DmC but there's certain events that happen in 1 that you can get the gist of in DmC.   In any case, enjoy. The games may be hard in some places but they're an awful lot of fun no matter what order you play them in."

DevilMayCry,1m91ka,Ponce_In_A_Blue_Box,3,Thu Sep 12 15:25:37 2013 UTC,"Per each point:   Nero doesn't have a dedicated blocking action, but once you unlock Dante you'll find that he has a very useful set of blocking actions. However, both characters have effective parries, Nero in particular can do a variety of parries with his Buster and Snatch moves, though the timing is really difficult... Dodging is still a great option though, as parries have a bit of commit to them whereas dodging leaves you free to go in for any attack. The scarecrows are supposed to be fodder enemies. The rest of the enemies in the game are progressively more challenging. On higher difficulties a majority of the challenge is how they mix together. Depends on what version your playing. The console versions don't have the turbo mode (speeds up the game by about ~25%), while DMC3 Special Edition did; the PC version of 4 has it, however. Personally, the console version is almost unplayable for me. You should be able to use them from the menu. Are you sure that you have them in stock?   Miscellaneous Note: Nero and Dante play very differently from each other. Nero has a pretty low skill ceiling, though it may still take a while to get a handle on all of best techniques; Ex-Act and MAX-Act, Charge Shots, Table Hopping, Buster counters, Shuffle and Calibur, the list goes on and on and weaving all of these things into each other during a fight can be a little tolling.  Dante, on the other hand, has a very high skill ceiling seeing as he just has so many moves at his disposal. It's partially why I prefer 4 to 3; there are so many ways to build insane combos, even if the style-system makes it all a little clunky.  There are numerous combat tutorials on youtube which can help you to utilize all of the different game mechanics."

It's been a while since I played four. The I think of it is playing as Nero feels kind of like the first dmc, and playing as Dante is more like three, only you get to change styles on the fly instead of picking one per mission."
DevilMayCry,1m91ka,jgrex22,1 point,Thu Sep 12 16:15:16 2013 UTC,Nero unlocks a blocking move later where you can carry a smaller enemy and use them as a shield. You move slower while carrying it though.
DevilMayCry,1m91ka,Raonak,1 point,Fri Sep 13 02:05:07 2013 UTC,"DMC and dark souls are on the total opposite ends of the action game spectrum. But at the same time, reward you with the same sense of satisfaction when you finally reach that moment where you fully understand the game.  DMC is all about stylistically obliterating your enemies to the point of embarrasment.  Your whole point is to keep your style meter high, so you're gonna be attacking a lot, and attacks can be cancelled out of, so unlike DS, where you're looking for openings, you want to constantly be on the offensive in DMC.   Look up some DMC4 combat videos if you want to see how it's meant to be played.  Dodging is the way to go in DMC, learn it, live it, breathe it. you are completely invincible while dodging, and there is very little recovery frames after a dodge. The dodge input is a bit hard to get your head around at first, but soon you'll get used to it."
DevilMayCry,1m91ka,CatnipPhilosophy,1 point,Fri Sep 13 09:38:05 2013 UTC,"Compared to the careful approach you use in dark souls, and the more defensive approach you'd use in ninja gaiden, dmc4 is very offensive based. enemies don't attack much compared to those games.  dodging is best done by jumping (since it has some invincibility frames) or targetlock+left/right+jump. the trick is to dodge or jump as late as possible. But the best way to be defensive in this game is to increase your damage potential.(and thus decrease the amount of time an enemy has to attack you) Bind the gun button to R2/RT, and buy the charge shot skill. upgrade it as fast as possible. it does sick damage and stuns easily. you hold it all the time and during a combo you let go. Spam streak a lot (target lock+forward+swordbutton) as well as the demon hand (circle/B)  make a habit out of pressing the swordRev button while you swing. eventually it will work and you'll get a charge. when you have a charge use streak to do extra fire damage.  once you get to play as dante the game gets a lot harder, but also better. look up the dmc4 advanced combat tutorial part 1 and 2, to learn how to use him like a pro. Knowing how to play him makes the game incredible and unlike any other game you've played. You can make special moves out of combinations of moves. like the star rave.  video related. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIUtt8cNqXo"

DevilMayCry,1ivy57,Xolcin,4,Sun Dec 8 17:44:44 2013 UTC,"I've always had this thought since the first time I fought Arkham in DMC 3 with my friend. If they already had the ability to add multiplayer for the half of one mission, it would've been awsome to include it in the whole game as Co-op or competitive multiplayer."
DevilMayCry,1ivy57,IAMSPARDA,4,Tue Jul 23 16:43:12 2013 UTC,My thoughts exactly. Fighting arhkam in those glorious 2 and half minutes of co-op gameplay was amazing. The games clearly designed to be single player but with co-op being available it could really open a lot of doors. Idk if anyone has played mortal Kombat Shaolin monks but that had a great action/adventure game co-op. you could string together combos and play off your partner really well. I think DMC could do something like that.
DevilMayCry,1ivy57,Device90,2,Wed Jul 24 01:17:43 2013 UTC,Finally someone who agrees. Hopefully if Capcom makes a Devil May Cry 5 they'll spend a good amount of time tryin to incorporate co-op into the game.

DevilMayCry,1ivy57,ScarecrowsWord,1 point,Thu Oct 17 03:51:23 2013 UTC,Look at the latest Ninja Gaiden game by ninja theory for some multiplayer.  Would probably end up like that. What would be cool is actually creating your own hybrid character and fight against people like Dante and Vergil.  Then taking something like the dynasty warriors characters by choosing a move set depending on the weapon you're using.  Limit the players to only switching between 2 weapons maybe 3 (not including guns) and this could be balanced and fun with PvE and PvP
DevilMayCry,1ivy57,jsquared069,3,Thu Jul 25 21:21:18 2013 UTC,"It was TEAM Ninja that did NG3, NOT Ninja Theory. They are two completely unrelated devs other than making hack and slashers.  Personally, I'd rather see a cooperative mode than PvP if there is ever another DMC game."

I've heard this about DMC2 (the new one, if you don't get the joke):   Story: Kinda interesting premise but poorly executed. Characters: Butchered. They had a completely new look and behaviour planned for Dante but since the fans might not like the new Dante they merged him with the original out of fear. This made him unfocused and didn't feel like a person. Vergil has zero honour which is a defining character trait for him. Main Combat: Awsome. I don't know what people are complaining about. It looks fine and I've heard that there's been improvements compared to the original games. Ranking system: Broken. Your rank only goes down when you take a hit and it's easy to dodge. This means that you can flee for as long as you want and maintain the current rank (A, SSS whatever). In the old games it would go down if you didn't attack and reset if you got hit. Way too easy.   This is a summary of what I've heard. You'll have to choose for yourself if you like it or not."

I'm constantly learning how do new things and use my imagination to figure out even better combinations for combos. A friend of mine actually is really into Planetside 2 and is trying to get me to play but I feel it will be just like Battlefield. Where I'm constantly trying to get new upgrades and advancements. I feel like instead of throwing all of these advancements at you, these games should give you a huge variety of ways you can customize your own solider. However in an online setting people are always bickering about balanced classes and weapons and I think this is why these games cant have an overwelming amount of variety. So instead to keep you busy they just throw the stupid advancements and unlocks at you. In the end what keeps people playing a game is having fun with it, not trying to unlock every stupid little thing there is."

You think so, right?"" ""I won't lie..."" ""Then come on babes, LET'S ROCK!"" The screen then turns on and it cuts to DMC 4 Dante kicking open the door of some building. Inside there's blood everywhere, and something catches Dante's eye. Scene change! DmC Dante is shown waking up to a phone call from Kat, she says, ""Dante! Go look outside!"" In the skies above Limbo City, a massive demon lord sits atop a throne, raining death and destruction down on the city. Dante tries to stop him, but he is beneath the notice of this godlike entity. Just then, when all hope seems lost, DMC 2 Dante falls out of this massive portal, hot on the trail of the demon lord. Even this Dante, with all his might, is unable to stop this demon god. Him and DmC Dante hook up during the battle and they both just barely escape through a portal. End trailer.  The premise for the game is simple. There is no one consistent ""Dante"". Dante from DMC 1 was a cocky badass, and it's not unbelievable that he's the same Dante from DMC 3 and 4. In DMC 2, they made Dante a gloomy badass. And I don't need to tell anyone here how different DmC Dante is from any of the other versions. This game would not attempt to ignore or justify those differences as the previous games have, rather it would embrace them, as these Dantes are different men from different universes, and all 3 of them had very different experiences that shaped them into the people they are today. I wouldn't just stop at Dante though, that's just the opener.  There would be 6 main characters for the game, each with their own personalities and reasons for fighting.  DmC Dante: He's young and he has what it takes to be a real hero, but he's not there yet. For him, this journey is about saving his home, as well as self discovery, as he learns what it means to be a Son of Sparda.  DMC 4 Dante: He's the Dante we all know and love. Nothing has changed about him, except for the situation he's been thrust into. He sees himself as the father figure that DmC Dante never had. He's a trainer and mentor to young DmC Dante.  DMC 2 Dante: This guy is kind of messed up. For those that aren't familiar with the DMC 2 lore, this is the most powerful version of Dante. DMC 2 was his personal quest to surpass his father. By slaying Argosax and the Despair Embodied he truly believes that he is better than Sparda ever was. He's a hero at heart, but he's also a very callous and cold man that believes in his own strength more than anything else.  Vergil and Nero: These two are connected, and neither of their stories are finished. When this conflict begins and portals to other universes start appearing, Nero is crippled by pain in his right arm. Eventually the arm falls off, completely severing itself from his body. The arm mutates and turns into Nero Angelo. Reborn and now fully back in control, Vergil ends his DT state. As Nero lays there dying, Vergil explains to him that Nero never actually got his power from his arm, or from Yamato, because Nero has always possessed demonic power of his own. Nero is a Son of Sparda  Sparda: Yes, Sparda will be brought back. His purpose is to be the unifying central figure that his sons all rally behind to wage war on a demon god. How the hell this happens I haven't the faintest idea. Maybe Sparda wasn't really dead, and the release of the demon god has unsealed him from some ancient slumber. Or maybe it's the power of the demon god himself. It's not inconceivable that a being strong enough to rip holes in the fabric of reality just by his mere presence could also bring about the revival of his greatest foe. Either way, Sparda is back!  At this point if you're still reading, you're either as crazy as me, or you just can't stop laughing. I think this would be great though for a lot of reasons. There'd be a lot of interesting personality conflicts between the 3 Dantes, Vergil, Nero and Sparda. Great opportunity for some ham fisted comedy moments too. DmC Dante says to DMC 4 Dante, ""Dude! What's wrong with your hair! Are you wearing a mop?"" DMC 4 Dante pulls out a mirror ""You clearly need to get your eyes checked kid. There's nothing wrong with hair this fine."" admires self in mirror.  A game like this would need to be long, which is one of the big reasons why it would never happen. In order for each character to get a satisfying amount of screen time I think there'd need to be about 40 missions. Also yes, I'm changing canon a bit by saying that DMC 2 is not part of the 1/3/4 universe.  DMC MULTIVERSE GO!!!"
DevilMayCry,1f4rs2,Chaotix247,6,Mon May 27 11:12:43 2013 UTC,No.
DevilMayCry,1f4rs2,SmokinSickStylish,2,Mon May 27 16:21:16 2013 UTC,"There's a fine line between DMC4 Dante's swagger and flamboyance. I think you might have crossed it with ""hair this fine"".  I'd more realistically see a scene where a bad guy pops up and Donte says ""What do you want, sack of shit?"" and DMC4 Dante says ""Hey, kid, you don't even pretend to have class, do you? this here, is a minion of hell!"" While chuckling and clapping before bowing. The creature would then slam a fist down on DMC4 Dante.  Next thing we see is DMC4 Dante sitting on top of the creature's back looking relaxed, before jumping upwards and helm-breaking down with rebellion, destroying the creature.  He then turns to Donte, ""Now, see how much fun that was?"""
DevilMayCry,1f4rs2,Bassnectar_and_milk,7,Mon Jul 8 15:51:10 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and be that girl and say I'd play the shit out of that. I love the idea of all the Dantes together. (also DmC 4 Dante is hot) So yeah. Love the concept. Downvote me if you will, diehard original Dante fans."
DevilMayCry,1f4rs2,Bassnectar_and_milk,2,Mon May 27 16:26:34 2013 UTC,"Sorry, I meant DmC Dante. DMC 5 Dante? Reboot Dante? Call him what you will."

DevilMayCry,1euxrh,AJockeysBallsack,6,Wed May 22 20:56:54 2013 UTC,"Dante was more mash friendly and his damage was much higher at the start. Vergil relies more on parrys and evades to survive,  you cant just go in swingin. Once you upgrade Vergil's skills, he hits a lot harder than Dante but you still need to parry and evade often. The best thing about Vergil is how much easier jc loops are with him than Dante. I'd give those a shot with killer bee jc loops and helm breaker jc loops and eventually trying his other moves. Hope this helps."
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,IAMSPARDA,1 point,Thu May 23 01:13:06 2013 UTC,"Learn how to JC Orbit, Aerial Rave and Killer Bee. Also learn Atomic and Solar Flare (they're just charges, so it'll take some time). Vergil was designed for JCing"
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,IAMSPARDA,3,Thu May 23 01:25:19 2013 UTC,"Forgive my ignorance, but what is JCing? Jump cancelling? Dante was so freaking strong I never had to learn it. Can you give an example for me to try in training mode?   Turbo edit - if you mean doing thing like aerial rave and performing Orbit before the third slice that knocks them back, then I know about that. I'm just ignorant abot the more advanced techniques.   Unless you mean Jesus Christing, which would require lots of Golden Orbs badumtsh"
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,IAMSPARDA,1 point,Thu May 23 04:00:48 2013 UTC,"Yes, jcing is jump canceling,  the best ones to learn first are killer bee and helm breaker. Once you have the enemy in the air input one of the 2 attacks and as soon as Vergil makes contact jump off them using enemy step and repeat to get the loop going."
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,IAMSPARDA,1 point,Thu May 23 10:41:53 2013 UTC,"Guess I should invest a point in enemy step.  I always did with Dante, and seeing as how Vergil has no Air Hike (only Trick Up), I should have done it from the beginning."
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,IAMSPARDA,1 point,Thu May 23 18:54:31 2013 UTC,"Yeah, you'll need it to get some of the lost souls and collectables too."

DevilMayCry,1euxrh,Witha3,1 point,Thu May 23 23:14:24 2013 UTC,"There's one for a lost soul and later on another for a health fragment.  I can't reach either one with Vergil D:  I tried hopping up and demon pulling stygians for the lost soul, and the Wisps looked promising since they float around and make for easy angel and devil pulls, but I just kept falling to my doom so I gave up.  The ending was less than impressive.  Unless, of course, super-demon Vergil is your enemy in DmC2.  Assuming they make one.  Edit - Got 'em.  I was trying too much BS to get the lost soul.  All it took was getting an enemy near the arch, pop them up, enemy step, trick up, kill lost soul.  I was trying all this demon pull BS over and over and about ready to tear my hair out.  The health fragment was a different story.  I would probably never had gotten it if a Wisp hadn't been so kind as to float almost all the way up to the platform, making for an easy Angel Pull, Step, and Lift.  He was so high up I didn't even need to Trick Up to reach it.  Thanks, buddy!  I still have no clue how to beat the Imprisoners other than to just run around, dodge, wait for them to charge, then irritate them a bit with my sword until they give up.  Oh, and use summoned and spiral swords non-stop too.  Side note:  Fuck Harpies.  And fuck the Witches that ALWAYS appear with them.  I want my Revenant and Aquila D:"
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,fourthsequence,1 point,Thu May 23 23:29:22 2013 UTC,I felt the same exact way. But it sorta feels like they left it at a cliffhanger ending so they could follow up from there in the next dmc. Also I got those on son of sparda mode but demon pulling to enemy stepping on the rages. Hope that helps.
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,fourthsequence,1 point,Thu May 23 23:38:43 2013 UTC,"I just beat VMD but only by using items and have been wondering the exact same thing, especially since I can play DMD casually. It sounds like jump canceling is Vergil's secret. If anyone has some good vids to share that'd be sweet."
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,Aumur,3,Thu May 23 05:14:49 2013 UTC,"Here's one Vergil player I've been watching for a week or so now, trying to pick up on techniques:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzwlZkJJJQE (Playing through VMD Mission 1)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98c1dBs1WZ8 (Crazy looking air combo)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06MwQIWwyjc (Mostly Dante combos, but there's some quality Vergil JC work here)  Plenty of fantastic JC tech, but it's not necessarily all JC focused. The VMD playthrough shows how you can use timed charge moves for crowd control, and that Arial Flush/Drive loop is actually something you can do without JCs at all (just alternate between the two in the air). Lots to work with here."
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,UnashamedRug42,1 point,Thu May 23 15:56:53 2013 UTC,Thanks! Sounds like what I need. Playing as Vergil has showed me how much I relied on Aquila for crowd control as Dante.
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,jsquared069,1 point,Thu May 23 18:11:54 2013 UTC,"See, with Dante, I would use Hightime, Aerial Rave/Roulette, then before finishing the move, I would enemy step or Demon Pull, then Rake if necessary and then Hanger or Double up.  It was almost always a guaranteed kill, and it was so easy with Dante, I can't believe I skipped out on Enemy step when I used it so often with him.  It's a combo necessity.  I just wish Vergil had more weapons/air combos available.  Turbo edit - Aquila had some wicked enemy step/Demon Pull combos, and mixing up Aerial Rave with Aerial Buy-In made for great continuous air combos.  Goddamn, Dante was easy."
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,fourthsequence,1 point,Thu May 23 19:07:37 2013 UTC,This dude is playing the first level with full stats/abilities.  I was hoping for an actual first level play.  Oh well.   Edit - How the shit does this dude have almost 230k orbs?
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,jsquared069,1 point,Thu May 23 19:14:25 2013 UTC,"Well, it's a VMD playthrough, so he's already gone through Nephilim and SoS difficulty. He's probably spent lots of time re-running the campaign for practice, judging by the level of skill shown in his vids. I know I usually end up with a few thousand more red orbs after I've spent an evening re-running Mission 6 (I'm working on juggling the two tyrants right outside the final checkpoint right now), so the number makes sense to me."
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,fourthsequence,1 point,Thu May 23 20:00:10 2013 UTC,"Juggling Tyrants?  I'm guessing a well-timed Atomic?  Also, are the sword skills useful?  I have basic summon swords and uh...surrounding swords.  I know they're useful for Stygians, but what other purpose do they serve?  I mean, I can Demon Pull and Angel Pull without them.  Also, the moves with added Embed powers.  Any good?"
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,jsquared069,1 point,Thu May 23 21:15:30 2013 UTC,"Atomic and Solar Flare are good enough for getting them in the air, but keeping them up there is a bit dicey. I'm having some limited luck mixing up Orbit/Arial Flush/Killer Bee, but if I get too spam happy on Orbit I end up spiking them right back down to the ground. Gonna take some more work to get right I think.  Summoning Swords are generally useful for stacking damage in a combo, since you can call them out even when you're in the middle of another attack. They're also nice for juggling if mixed up correctly. Not sure if the embed swords really get you any tactical advantage though, aside from the extra bit of damage..."
DevilMayCry,1euxrh,Shameuno3,1 point,Fri May 24 00:07:36 2013 UTC,"Embed swords allows you to instantly use angel/demon pull, instead of waiting the small amount of time it takes for the sword to hit. It seems that embedded swords also get priority when trying to target an enemy in a cluster."
