Just a few tips for you, since I also have very thick hair: Yes, it is possible to grow long, but it may just be harder during the awkward phase. If you want to grow your hair long long, it's likely there will be an awkward phase, but you can deal with that in many ways.  Also, it's up to you how you want to begin growing it. For myself, my top hair was already long (about 5"") when I started growing it. Now the sides and back are trying to catch up, but I think the long hair on the top actually makes it look a lot less awkward. When growing it out, you can go for ""healthy trims"" where you cut off loose ends, or you can simply not go for cuts and just bear through it all and let it grow.  Goodluck!"

malehairadvice,3dyte1,murfi,3,Mon Jul 20 17:15:18 2015 UTC,Are you blow drying your hair?  And what wax/pomade did you try?
malehairadvice,3dyte1,BrightKnight141,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:21 2015 UTC,"when they're longer i do, now that they are short, i dont. i dont need a whole lot of hold in the gel type of sense. i want ""loose"" hair put in position. with the most products, i put them in and they are ok, but after 1 hour or so my hair begins to fall into my face, starts to go in my faces direction. i style my hair to the side and back a bit.  as for wax and pomade: i tried black&white pomade and v05 styling wax. the b&w was ok if i used a LOT of product when i had long hair. otherwise my hair would loose shape shortly after appying. same with wax, but that has even less hold. the way basically only seems to make my hair greasy without any notable amount of hold."
malehairadvice,3dyte1,BrightKnight141,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:41 2015 UTC,"Hairspray may be what you need product wise then, because most waxes and clays can only be so strong.  Maybe try Hanz de Fuko's Claymation?"
malehairadvice,3dyte1,BrightKnight141,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:47 2015 UTC,"yeah i would love to try that. thing is they are expensive and i'd have to order it from amazon uk, so that will be extra shipping costs for me being in ireland. since i'm cheap, i'll first try some of the other similar products i can get here locally. american crew fiber i can get here, i've seen it in a barber shop here."
malehairadvice,3dyte1,BrightKnight141,2,Tue Jul 21 07:26:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I would recommend fiber- if Claymation's hold is 10/10, fiber would be 4-5/10.  See if you can get some Dynamite Clay by Vilain or Layrite Cement.  Both of those are really high hold, and in the end, you'll be happier spending the extra few pounds as you'll have true hold."

malehairadvice,3dyte1,BigBeefyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is considered to be a clay.  Clays and waxes are usually pretty similar, although clays tend to have more hold, however, some manufacturer's just throw the term clay on what I would consider to be a wax, so I'd be wary of buying a random product off the shelf.  If you want to let /r/MHA know what product is, we can probably let you know how it preforms."
malehairadvice,3dyte1,joconno23,2,Tue Jul 21 09:39:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is mentioned enough but...    Volumising powder. Big Sexy makes some, American Crew makes some, try it out. Matte hold, let's you rework with minimal effort throughout the day. Hold is unreal. I sprinkle it at my roots after blow-drying, then sprinkle on top of hair, then blast with cool air how I want it, shape with fingers at the finale. It takes less time than other product and doesn't require me to wash/wet my hands afterward. I have used it with success on 6"" hair and 3"" hair (currently) and all stages/styles in between.      My only issue is the price. I am still figuring out how to make my own."
malehairadvice,3dyte1,Spencer1199234,2,Mon Jul 20 20:05:40 2015 UTC,If you are willing to spend around $20 on product then i would recommend mister pompadour natural beeswax or hanz de fuko claymation

malehairadvice,3dz7n3,AmbassadorFunk,3,Mon Jul 20 19:12:34 2015 UTC,"I see. Let's do some problem solving. What kind of place do you go to get your hair cut? Old fashioned straight razor barber shop, salon, modern barber, supercuts?"
malehairadvice,3dz7n3,AmbassadorFunk,2,Mon Jul 20 19:27:36 2015 UTC,"Tried a ""trendy"" salon in Manchester (£25, about $40). Lovely fellow, very nice chat about fashion! But still not what I wanted.  Dad's friend who happens to also be a ""trendy"" hairdresser (free), still not what I want.  Then a typical modern barber, again not what I wanted.  :-;  I feel there's an awkward stigma afterwards of telling them they didn't do it how you wanted because they can't do anything about it. I'm sure they'd love an undo button, but that's not how it works, and I don't want to make them feel shitty if I was unclear."
malehairadvice,3dz7n3,AmbassadorFunk,4,Mon Jul 20 19:48:20 2015 UTC,"Man, I know that feeling. Recently I had a bad haircut from a good barber and I don't know what to tell him. Back to your thing. Although I've never been to a salon, it might just be the place you're looking for. Folks at salons tend to be more experienced in cutting longer hair, so I'd recommend you look into that.   Alternatively tell your barber/hairdresser ""USE THE SCISSORS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE MADE OF COMBS"" These are some sort of special thinning scissors that do just the thing you want them to."

Making the sides longer than the top will emphasize thinning hair, so you want to cut the sides short enough so that the top looks longer/fuller in comparison to the sides.

malehairadvice,3dwf5x,Andrew49378,3,Mon Jul 20 02:30:05 2015 UTC,"I'm no pro, but can give some advice from experience with same hair.  Basically its hell to take care of them when they go above short/average length. So keeping them short is what i try to do most times. But sometimes i'm lazy or have no time to visit barber shop so few things help:  First thing don't shampoo your hair everyday, each three or so days should work. That will help with maintaining your natural hair oils, that ""puff down"" your hair and add weight to them.   Second after washing your hair don't go crazy with towel, NEVER USE HAIR DRYER, just gently stroke them with towel, and put on a hat (winter hat or so, that would cover as much hair as possible). Keep it on for about half hour, till your hair dries. This will help your hair absorb the water, and in turn they won't be as poofy.   After that apply some gel or wax, to keep em down for longer. Especially if its windy outside, and you wont be wearing any kind of hat.  Other thing i do is if i know i'm going somewhere on monday, i wash my hair sunday morning, that way they kinda poof down, as the hair get tiny bit oily over the day, and as a result don't look as poofy/dry the following day."

malehairadvice,3du4m4,sun12jul,35,Sun Jul 19 14:19:20 2015 UTC,"Go into a well reviewed barber shop and ask for a 2 on the sides, low, gradual fade into 2 inches on top.  Buy some American Crew Forming Cream on the way out and after your next shower, comb a marble-sized amount through your hair, back and to the side.  After you've done that for a bit you can fin tune and tweak what you want on your next couple cuts but right now your priority should be getting rid of the animal on top of your head."

It'll be tough to get a cut that good at a ten dollar barber, but as long as you keep it short on the sides and GRADUALLY fade up, you'll be able to figure out what you like and fine tune it from there."

But in the auto sector, ""WT"" is used in describing oil viscosity. It's incorrectly referred to as ""weight"" but actually represents ""winter"", or viscosity when cold. So a 10W40 motor oil has a viscosity rating of 10 when cold, and a maximum thickness of 40 when hot.   Anyway, I'm assuming that number has something to do with the pomade's thickness when applying. But I'm probably wrong."

malehairadvice,3drbr3,xraigekoux,2,Sat Jul 18 22:05:20 2015 UTC,Get rid of the sides and back dude taper/fade that sht. Get an actual part and trim the top just a tiny bit.
malehairadvice,3drbqi,DoesThisMakeMeLookFa,6,Sat Jul 18 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"Duuuude what's up haha you do look like me!!  To me it looks great. I'm so jealous of your volume. I think the immense volume you have is something you should take advantage of, and this style does do that."
malehairadvice,3drbqi,gumpshin,3,Sat Jul 18 18:52:08 2015 UTC,Thanks man! Having all this volume has its pros and cons. I'm experimenting with it right now so I can try to find out what styles work best for my hair type!
malehairadvice,3drbqi,gumpshin,2,Sat Jul 18 19:04:48 2015 UTC,Low key you should get a mowhawk lol
malehairadvice,3drbqi,tangbang,2,Sat Jul 18 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"Well I think a fauxhawk could look decent on me, but I don't really like the punk vibe I might give off with one haha!"
malehairadvice,3drbqi,tangbang,8,Sat Jul 18 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"Right now it looks like there's a puff of hair sitting on your head. I'd say try to bring the part a little lower like this. Your hair right now makes your head look pretty round. It will definitely take time to grow the hair on the sides out a little more, but by taking the part lower, your head won't look so round anymore. Also, it'll look flow better. On the side that isn't the ""main part"" so to speak, and the back, I would try to work a little product into your hair so that there's less of a disconnect there. There will still be the obvious disconnect due to the length of hair, but the shape of the hair itself will flow better. On the plus side, asian hair like ours tends to grow fast, so the side with the ""main part"" shouldn't take that long to grow out. On the down side, this kind of hair is super stiff so getting the other side and the back to play nice might be a little bit of a struggle (or at least it was for me).  Edit: I don't know if it makes a difference. When I used to go to a predominantly white barbershop, they gave me a cut similar to yours. I'd chalk it up to less experience with Asian heads / hair types. I started going to this place with a couple of Vietnamese dudes cutting hair, and I feel like the hair cut I got there really helped my hair naturally fall into place better, and just overall flow better. You could see if there's any Asian barbershops around. It might be worth a shot."
malehairadvice,3drbqi,PriceZombie,2,Sat Jul 18 22:41:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your advice! I definitely think you're right man, that's why it seemed to me like something had been a bit off! Could you explain what you meant by working a bit of product so there's less of a disconnect there? Yeah you see, my dad cut my hair when we formed the part, and even though he did a really good job of cutting it especially for someone who isnt even a barber, the part did end up being kinda off. I'm planning on going to this one Korean lady for the second time  at a salon because every once in a while, she has to iron out some kinks near my ears and the top of my head. I'll take your advice and try to bring the part down lower!"
malehairadvice,3drbqi,tangbang,4,Sun Jul 19 03:28:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure man! I don't want to make too many assumptions about your hair, but it looks roughly like the texture and quality of my hair, so I'll talk about the lessons I've learned about this stiff, dry kind of asian hair. Our hair is naturally WAY dryer than white people hair. You'll notice how hair doesn't really form these ""groupings"" for lack of a better word. This makes our hair look like a big poof on top of our head naturally. To combat this, I dip 2-3 fingertips up to the first ""joint"" in the finger, depending on how long my hair is, into a jar of coconut oil and run it through my hair. This adds enough oil so it'll stop being Sahara dry. I like coconut oil because it's pretty much scentless. The oil will make your hair flow better on its own, as well as give it a little bit of a ""grouping"" effect. It won't actually make your hair greasy, due to how absurdly dry Asian hair can be.  For product, you can pretty much ignore any product labeled ""extra strong hold"", because that's a lie. None of them have any real amount of hold due to how stiff our hair is. The only product I use is Murray's Pomade. This is the OG stuff. It's wax based, not water. This shit will actually hold your hair. Be careful not to use too much, since this is the only product that I've ever come across where it was possible for me to use too much.  Get a thin, quarter sized portion of this stuff onto your palms. It's going to be really sticky until you warm it up with your hands. Rub your two hands together. The friction will get the Murray's to warm up and stop being so sticky. Then it's spreadable. Especially if you JUST spread the coconut oil through your hair, the little bit of left over oil in your hands and the little bit of oil in your hair will help the Murray's glide through your hair. I like to just spread this on the sides and back to keep it under control. Then, comb it while using a blow dryer to blow it backwards and downwards. The extra heat will help spread the Murray's even more evenly.  A few comments:   The pink Gatsby will work decently for holding the sides and the back down. However, the feel of my hair is really important to me. The pink Gatsby will make the hair feel kinda gritty and not pliable, which I don't like. The blue Gatsby will be alright for the middle and for where the part is. However, it is alcohol based, which will dry out your hair even more. Make sure you don't use too much Murray's. Just a little bit will produce great hold. Too much and it gets sticky. You'll see a lot of people complaining about it being too oily and staining their pillows. That's really because they used WAY too much. Use just enough so that it disappears to the touch after hitting it with the blowdryer. Stop using shampoo. I only use conditioner when I shower. Shampoo tends to dry out hair. Conditioner brings back the moisture. Only use conditioner, so you stop drying out your hair. Also, don't use the 2 in 1 stuff, since it's not good at being either a shampoo or a conditioner.   Edit: Sorry I'm multitasking cleaning, drinking, and redditing right now. If something didn't make sense, I'll try to clarify. If it still doesn't make sense, I can try to clarify tomorrow when I'm less drunk lol."

I do feel pretty limited because of my water-only routine, but my hair is feeling better than ever, which I feel makes it worth the inconvenience.

I didn't think I'd need that much hold, plus it costs a bit more, but the original doesn't have very much hold unless you really use a lot"
malehairadvice,3ds5if,BrightKnight141,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:57:22 2015 UTC,"I use Baxter clay, I've used other matte finish pomaded and molding pastes but batters by far gives me the best hold. I have wavy hair and batters is the only one that can comb out the waves. I've used tigi bed head matte molding paste and morrocan surf paste to. Tigi is only good if u plan on using a blow dryer. Has decent hold but takes to long to dry. Morrocan surf paste actually thickens. Y hair which is nice since I have thin hair but it's hold is only okay. Great matte finish tho and smells great  Haven't tried the others u mentioned tho, except for layrite that my barber used on me once, honestly I do t remember anything about this. I've used murrays, suavecito and bonafide tho.   Murrays is elephant jizz. Takes like 3 days to wash out, high sheen and permanent hold. It can survive a hurricane. Suavecito is ok. It's barely better than hair gel in my opinion. Bonafide is good tho, good hold medium shine, if you're looking for that I would recommend."

malehairadvice,3dsvkp,Ctrix65513,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:21:28 2015 UTC,I'm trying to differentiate between these three styles and choose one for myself. Is it safe to say they are all a play on the side part? What's your favorite?  The first black and white one looks most basic to me being a simple side part with the sides faded.  The second one looks likes he has really short hair on the top but the part is still accentuated being shaven in.  The third (and the one I think I like the most) is longer hair on the top with the part being accentuated and shaven in.
malehairadvice,3dsvkp,triplee9,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:34:59 2015 UTC,the second fade is really High and really short. The second is pretty High aswell but the top is longer. The third one Has the longest top and the fade is lower than the other twos. Also he has the darkest hair which makes the fade stand out even more.
malehairadvice,3dt66o,BustinJurkz,2,Sun Jul 19 05:22:17 2015 UTC,"Hey! Lately my hairs been pretty unruly (I just re-shave the sides so I can save LOL). I've never looked into my hair in detail before - I'm unsure if its wavy or slightly curly - nor have I looked into the proper shape of my head. I'm open to any suggestion at all because I really don't know where to begin and I need a change.    Note: I've always had a large natural recede in my hair (2nd pic), so while I'm not self-conscious about it, I do know for a fact that buzzed hair looks awful on me - I had a Georges St. Pierre phase and thought I could pull it off :(. Thanks!!"
malehairadvice,3dt66o,Maaaaate,2,Sun Jul 19 05:22:49 2015 UTC,"I only shave the sides of my head too. Usually get a cut every 3-4 months just to get rid of damaged hair.   Your hair is wavy, which is good because you can pull of some really nice hairstyles without putting effort. Let it grow a little longer on the top (crown) if you want a more disconnected look since your sides look freshly cut. What I'd recommend (since you have the facial structure for it) is a cut like this. If you bring this in to your barber they should only take a few inches of the top as your current hair is Slightly too long for it.   How did you rock your hair before you shave the sides?  Your hair hasn't receded much at all. The reason it looks like that is because your hairline is higher up."
malehairadvice,3dt66o,Maaaaate,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:39:08 2015 UTC,wow I really like that example!  Do you think I can get that done today or should I let it the sides grow out a bit more for that?

malehairadvice,3dsm02,AliSighed,3,Sun Jul 19 04:34:28 2015 UTC,"+1 quicksand is the way to go, also American crew forming cream is great as well it has a little shine but not too much."
malehairadvice,3dtf6y,ms_PaintYourPost,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:35:57 2015 UTC,Thats a pompadour. Google it and find a real life picture to show to your barber. The product depends entirely on your hair and if you want shine or matte appearance. For matte try American Crew Fibre or Tigi Matte Separation. I personally don't like shine for my hair but I guess some kind of Pomade would be good.

malehairadvice,3drwj6,forgotmyoldpassword2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:33:30 2015 UTC,Yeah it might be hard to style your hair back with that hairline. I would personally trim the sides and back to a short length and keep the top relatively long.   Edit I think I am not the best person to give advice for your hair. I don't know how you can style that type of hair. Honestly if you gave it volume and kept it down in the back it would look a lot better though. Still trim the sides and back I think.

I tend to use whatever happens to be around (if anything) and I feel like I have to use a ton of it to actually have an effect.   Well you can use some conditioner to help with your hair (Like every 2 days) I would suggest shampoo-ing every 3 days.  I would use oils. Like coconut oil and Argan Oil.   I would use some sea salt spray if you're into that (texturizing spray).  I would lastly grab some cream product (HDF Scheme Cream or American Crew Forming Cream) Stuff with Medium shine. I would use quite a bit of it (a nickel worth) mix it with some water and apply it.   I don't know too much about long hair so I recommend x-posting to /r/FierceFlow

You can take that in whatever way you want but you come off with a warmer personality with your previous style. It could also just be the angle. With a username like yours though you might be seen now as a stoic and more intimidating character.
malehairadvice,3dpfl9,MysticalOrca,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:51:09 2015 UTC,You pull off the topknot really well. Even with the length on the sides (usually top knots have a #1 guard one the side) I like it. Will you be switching up styles?  I can see a slick back and a pompadour being done. Even a side-part since in your first picture it naturally parts to your right
malehairadvice,3dpfl9,Maaaaate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:55:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely, it really depends on the mood I am in. If I'm lazy I'll rock a top knot or slick back. But if I want to mess with it, I'll probably comb it in a rockabilly type style. But all I want is a messy undercut by leaving the crown droop and let my hair do the work because I have wavy hair and some subtle curls."
malehairadvice,3dp05d,bd33,2,Sat Jul 18 01:58:59 2015 UTC,"I think letting the sides grow out a little and styling the top of your hair more up, not back, would pretty much make your current style ideal."

malehairadvice,3dmwhx,punaynay,7,Fri Jul 17 15:51:48 2015 UTC,I say try it out! Leave the top relatively the same length.
malehairadvice,3dmwhx,manasource123,8,Fri Jul 17 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"I guess there's no harm in trying but if you'd like something different, I'd personally suggest growing your hair out instead."
malehairadvice,3dmwhx,s_waldorf,3,Fri Jul 17 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"I actually just got a similar cut that's working out for me very nicely. Based off this photo. http://hairstyleonpoint.com/top-10-short-mens-hairstyles-2015/6/  I get what you mean by having the sides match with the beard, like one continuous piece (if that is what you mean).  When I showed the photo to the stylist, I started with a couple acknowledgements 1) I'm not a model like in the photo 2) My hair on top isn't quite long enough to pull off the look entirely, but it's getting there. Based off the length of your hair ontop, it's kind of on the border. You might want to let the hair on top grow out just a few weeks more, which you can accelerate with a few home remedies.  She was actually beating me to that last point, but I was glad we were both on the same page. So I ended up getting a ""set up"" if you will, my hair on top is the same length, my sides are clipped, but with added length, and not completely buzzed like in the photo. But the same over all look is complete, and all I need to do  is let my top hair grow longer before doing that extreme side buzz.  It's much easier to handle, and I can do a lot more with it. I've been messing around with a few styling patterns, a few different pomades & mattes, even thinking about doing a zig-zag buzz design in the back.  But I've been getting really positive feed back the last couple days and has definitely been a major boost in my life as well as feeling good to have a real hair style.  So yeah, I'd recommend it. You've got the right idea, if this rant has been accurate to what you're looking for"

It's still pretty patchy. I'm not sure how old you are, but you might have to wait. Scruff would probably look good, but that beard simply is not.    And an undercut (super sort sides) would look fantastic with that lovely plume you have going on there up top as well as your head shape, imho."

malehairadvice,3djmp8,ConvertsToMetric,6,Fri Jul 17 01:09:59 2015 UTC,Hi  I am 23 year old student and want to change something about my hairstyle.  It was basically the same style you see in my album although it was a bit longer a few years ago. I cut it a bit shorter in the last years for easier maintenance (Also haven't used any products). The problem I have now is that my big forehead / high hairline are quite visible in combination with my side parting (pic #3). Which looks kind of weird.  You probably have noticed that my face is kind of unsymmetrical. Is there something I can do with my hair to counter that?  Now I'm looking for a haircut that's easy to maintain (shouldn't be longer than now) and needs no products. Besides that I am open for everything except undercuts or very short haircuts.
malehairadvice,3djmp8,Fanta-stick,3,Thu Jul 16 20:21:29 2015 UTC,Short hairstyles tend to work well with a high hairline. No idea how that will impact an asymmetrical face though
malehairadvice,3djmp8,forgotmyoldpassword2,3,Thu Jul 16 21:51:45 2015 UTC,I think you'd look pretty dope with a slicked back Christian bale hair. You have a vegeta hairline in a good way

malehairadvice,3dlzs2,JadedFish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:21:35 2015 UTC,"I generally just trim it down to a 4 on the top and a 2 on the sides and let it grow out. Willing to try something new (Probably an undercut am I right?).  Also gotta sort out hair products, they'd probably do me good, I don't use any products other than Shampoo/Conditioner a few times a week.  I did do the No-Poo thing for a month, hair looked a bit more curlier but the sides of my hair are unmanageable, I'll probably have to keep them short constantly.  Old barber also fucked with my widow's peak, mine's a bit extreme but I'm scared to grow it out because of that awkward growth period since hair there grows slower (also hairline looks cleaner - but the skin there is darker due to hair.....)  Any hairstyle/product/styling tips appreciated."

At the moment you look, a little, like your hair is receding so you had to shave it when in reality your hair isn't receding. Honestly, as an older guy, you have decades ahead of you when you'll probably have to rock the shaven head look. Enjoy having amazing hair now and leave shaving until later.   If I were you I would grow your hair and go for the long on the top, short on the sides look. Keep the fringe  long so you can comb in back and, then, if you like, you can keep your sides shaved."

That's the change that's going to have the largest impact on your life.  Hair is something you can play around and experiment with, but your health is invaluable."

Right now its a bit too thin and in my opinion doesn't look as good as the old style you were rocking. I think in a week or two this cut will look better.

malehairadvice,3dl0i4,Suhmedoh,2,Fri Jul 17 03:09:55 2015 UTC,Shampooing every day is a bit excessive. I would cut it to 2-3 times a week. If you work out or sweat a lot you could try water only or conditioner washing for the rest of the days.   Curly hair generally suffer from dryness. Definitely check out /r/curlyhair

If I leave it down it looks like the second pic, with long loose curls, but it gets frizzy when it dries, I haven't tried using mousse or conditioner when it's down.   I also sometimes just put it in a pony tail, mostly after it starts getting frizzy after being down all day.  Are there any haircuts or styles that would work while still keeping my hair unique? I Really like the undercut hairstyle but I don't think that would work for my hair.   Should I be shampooing or conditioning it less? I usually shampoo and condition it once a day, but now I'm hearing that's not good. I use Mane n Tail shampoo and conditioner.  Any advice or tips are appreciated!"

Most guys are shy about talking to a cutter before submitting to the blades. Take the time to talk about what you want. If you're going to someone new have a friend take a few good photos from all angles of the cut you want to maintain, so you can show a new cutter what you want them to aim for. Photos of how it looks when you like it most can be very helpful."

I use label.m products, specifically the Extra Strong Gel, Sleek Blow Out Cream and Power Paste. The full version of what I do in the morning is wash, wash, condition, comb diagonally back from my parting, a blob of Extra Strong Gel spread evenly, followed by Sleek Blow Out Cream. The cream can also be used on the sides to slick it back if it's too long. Then I blow dry it while combing. When it gets to moist/damp, I put Power Paste in and style it. I then let it air dry for the next 10 minutes or so. This look in the picture is that process 30 hours after. I realise now that the title may be misleading. What I meant was, ""should I do a quiff?"", but I poorly attempted to have a more interesting title. I will post another picture to show what it looks like with the process tomorrow morning (UK).

malehairadvice,3ddn78,ACatWalksIntoABar,2,Thu Jul 16 06:17:36 2015 UTC,how you get your hair like its styled in the first pics
malehairadvice,3dh8nd,ThrowawayKelp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:44:09 2015 UTC,"You need to stop shampoo-ing so often, it strips your hair of oils and leaves it super dry. Try shampooing/conditioning every 3 days or so instead of every night.  You will build up some natural oils that will give you hair some life back."
malehairadvice,3dh8nd,desmin88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:56:36 2015 UTC,any suggestion for product because right now i use none at all
malehairadvice,3dh8nd,desmin88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:00:03 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you want to style, but there are plenty of helpful guides in the sidebar."
malehairadvice,3dh8hp,TheManofAnotherWorld,3,Thu Jul 16 06:42:17 2015 UTC,"You need to get an undercut, and go back to the barber/salon to keep the sides trimmed. The only reason the sides stick up is because you let it grow to a point where they look like that. For your current hair to look good, you need an undercut or a sharp fade."
malehairadvice,3dh8hp,desmin88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:54:31 2015 UTC,"My hair grows pretty fast, especially my sides. Any advice to keep them short, mostly the sides?"
malehairadvice,3dh8hp,desmin88,3,Thu Jul 16 06:58:01 2015 UTC,"If you want the sides to stay short longer, get them cut shorter initially."
malehairadvice,3dh8hp,xraigekoux,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:00:59 2015 UTC,Alright thank you!
malehairadvice,3dh8hp,BlueGreyish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:07:56 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest getting a pair of clippers. I personally use Oster Fast Feeds with purple magnetic guards. They allow you to trim your sides to keep them short.   They're on Amazon right now for about $50. Might seem a little pricey compared to ones at Costco or Walmart... but it's an investment.   Started shaving my hair for 6 years starting in high school... and I've saved so much money that way. (1 haircut/ 2 weeks for 6 years... and I'ved saved $1560 compared to if I had gone to a barber for a $10 cut) I would even cut some of my friends hair and make a decent amount of dough on the side.  Plus, it's incredibly rewarding learning how to fade/taper. The dude who was most helpful was Cakenisrandy on youtube."

My brother has been saying,""Just get an undercut."" But I'm still worried that my sides will stand up because in the past when I cut my hair short, the sides always stand up."
malehairadvice,3dh8hp,ConvertsToMetric,2,Thu Jul 16 06:48:04 2015 UTC,I'd suggest getting a 1 on the sides. You'll probably need to get it cut every 2 weeks to maintain/keep it looking fresh.
malehairadvice,3df0ie,-AceOfSpades-,2,Wed Jul 15 19:27:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely cut the back shorter I would say. Like right up to your neck. After that I think you could rock it if you cut the rest by just a few inches, too and have it swept to the side like youre doing."

malehairadvice,3ddwys,dadsmeatwagon,4,Wed Jul 15 14:46:26 2015 UTC,"My beard looks like his. I don't shave my neck at all, only thing I shave is my cheek line. I simply shape the beard with my hands. Just press the sides and lift underneath. If it doesn't want to stay, wet it, then towel dry. That'll soften the hairs.  Edit: if it still won't cooperate, buy some beard balm and try again."
malehairadvice,3ddwys,southwade,2,Wed Jul 15 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"I also had this going on before taking my current job. I'd recommend taking a bit of beard wax, then a drop or two of beard oil and run that to create a sort of pomade, then brush it downward"
malehairadvice,3ddwys,loadedtomcat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:38:39 2015 UTC,"My beard looks like this too and I use the same method as you. For the best result I usually take shower, towel it dry and use a combination of beard wax, oil and a brush to shape it. Works like a charm and my beard will stay in shape for most of the day!  I'm a big fan of the waxes from 'Damn good soap company'. They smell amazing and aren't greasy at all. It gives my beard a natural look and feel while I can still shape it any way I like."

malehairadvice,3dh00q,helpmepls03,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:02:41 2015 UTC,Haircut is good man! I don't really like the trend of getting really close sides so I think your hair is just fine. Its pretty safe considering that it doesn't look too out of place.   Shave it off and keep it off.
malehairadvice,3dh00q,ItsActuallyButter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:42:52 2015 UTC,Thanks man! And yeah that's what I was thinking as well. Sadly my facial hair just doesn't grow well.

malehairadvice,3dfmk5,Scrubzyy,2,Wed Jul 15 22:02:43 2015 UTC,"(Not a hair expert by any means) I think maybe you should cut the sides, the top looks really nice, and I think with glasses it would look tuff"
malehairadvice,3dfmk5,bbubles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:06:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! I agree that it would look better with shorter sides
malehairadvice,3dfmk5,MLG_Panda,2,Wed Jul 15 23:41:44 2015 UTC,Looks great as it is! You could go shorter on the sides or make the parting more defined.
