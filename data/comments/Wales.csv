Wales,3dzquu,dwyfor16,3,Tue Jul 21 13:05:33 2015 UTC,What's the likelihood of it actually looking like this?
Wales,3dzquu,RConnz,4,Mon Jul 20 22:40:06 2015 UTC,"Who knows, there's been more then a few times in Cardiff when there's a completed building which ends up looking nothing like the renders, usually because they end up using far cheaper looking materials.  Since this and the development as a whole is a pretty high profile thing with quite a bit of money pumped into it I hope it'll look at least somewhat like the renders. Perhaps once they start cladding ""Central Square 1"" (that large building that's currently being built next to the station) then we'll get to see how close it matches the renders."
Wales,3dzquu,RConnz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:25:56 2015 UTC,"Central Square 1 looks pretty good so far, I just wonder if they'll take shortcuts with the bus station and it'll be half the size or something. Do we know if they've fully committed to this plan yet?"
Wales,3dzquu,dafydd_,2,Tue Jul 21 15:08:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think the planning permission has been sent out for it so there's certainly the possibility of it changing, but I hope they're committed to it. They're supposed to be starting construction later this this year anyway.  Although there's still a few questions over how this is going to fit in with Network Rail's plans for the train station, seeing the bus station plans shows a large canopy being connected to the station.  Although I wonder if the Cardiff Central expansion will actually be happening now, there hasn't been any updates from Network Rail since they announced it, and seeing as there's been lots of delays and cancellations of their rail projects recently I'm worried it might have been quietly thrown in the bin."
Wales,3dv68l,SirBlah,34,Sun Jul 19 19:58:43 2015 UTC,"There's no way they're going to try this on the Valley Lines, the trains can be so full the conductor doesn't even try to sell tickets to people, and most people end up buying their tickets when they get off at Queen Street.  If they're loosing money because of people dodging fares maybe they should invest in some bloody ticket offices, and stop closing the ones they have 5 minutes after peak time."

It would be nice if Arriva tidied up some of their stations though, on my local line the signs at some stations are becoming very faded.   force the Welsh Government to use their money for investments instead   What amuses me about this is this scheme near me - 4.5 miles of the work is actually in England.   using some of the worst trains British Rail ever created.   Can't disagree with that, the Pacers and 153s need to go. The 150s are slowly getting a refurb but it can't hide the fact that they're over 25 years old now. The 158s are pretty good but the air-con is shit on them.   And there's nothing anyone can do about it   The Welsh Government has this great idea of a not-for-profit system when Arriva's franchise ends, I doubt First or Abellio could do much better unless they invest massively into it. Unlikely if they won't make any money from it. I look at Scotrail with more than a touch of envy now."

Some smaller stations' ticket offices are closed and don't even have access to the machines until 7AM (provided they are actually working AND you have a card to pay with... what? you want to pay with cash? LOL), so unless you go to the station the night before to purchase/collect a ticket you're screwed. And forget about showing an email receipt of your ticket purchase- I've been told on a couple of occasions that this is not considered proof.  It's common to have 2-4 different guards on longer journeys, who change at different stations without any sort of announcement. So, if you have bought a ticket, but were unable to collect it for whatever reason, unless you get out of your seat at every single stop to (a) check if you have a new guard and (b) explain the situation again to them, you're at risk of being fined £70? Ridiculous.  ""The customer is always right a thief."""
Wales,3dv68l,haloraptor,5,Mon Jul 20 07:55:37 2015 UTC,"Then there's the scenario of needing to squeeze through the human-sardine-can of a laughably overcrowded carriage on these guard hunting missions.

Wales,3du9y2,ChaseTheWind,11,Sun Jul 19 15:16:36 2015 UTC,"Things to see in Cardiff:   St. Fagans National History Museum - a massive, largely open air museum containing dozens of buildings of historical significance that have been transported brick by brick or stone by stone and reconstructed within the confines of the museum. St. Teilo's Church is a paritcular highlight. Also has loads of interior exhibitions on Welsh history. Free entry and it could easily take a full day if not more to see it all. It's in the middle of some pretty exciting reconstruction projects at the moment, though I'm not sure when they're slated for completion. The National Museum & the Civic Centre - the National Museum has some surprisingly good art collections - particularly impressionists like Monet and Turner. Also home to some great geology / natural history exhibitions with a Welsh slant. Entry is once again free. It's housed within an impressive structure in Cardiff's civic centre, which is to my mind one of the finest examples of Edwardian planning and architecture anywhere in the world. Well worth a wander around - upstairs in the City Hall you'll also find a sort of ""hall of heroes"" full of statues of noteworthy Welsh figures. Cardiff Castle - The history of Cardiff is the history of the castle. It's built on the floorplan of the Roman fort, with a Norman keep and a vast Victorian mansion inside. The tour is costly, but worth it - some of the rooms inside the mansion are absolutely spectacular. Castell Coch, located on the northern edge of Cardiff, is a Victorian fairytale built on the foundations of a real castle. Built by the same architect as the mansion in Cardiff Castle, and it shows. Full of flamboyance and whimsy. Cardiff Bay - loads to see down the Bay. The Senedd, which houses the National Assembly of Wales, is a fantastic building which offers free tours. The Millennium Centre has you covered if you fancy some theatre. Plus there's loads of places to grab something to eat along the waterfront. The Rugby World Cup - you've timed your visit well. England are hosts this year, and Wales has managed to nick a few matches for the Millennium Stadium. Wales vs. Fiji on the 1st of October, New Zealand vs. Georgia on the 2nd, France vs. Ireland on the 11th and two quarter finals on the 17th and 18th. Be sure to soak up the atmosphere in the city centre on match day.   Outside of Cardiff:   The Brecon Beacons for hiking and natural beauty. Pen-y-Fan, the highest mountain in the range, is an extremely easy walk from the Storey Arms on the main road to Brecon. From there you could choose to walk along the ridge to Cribyn and beyond. Waterfall Country above Hirwaun is another great area to explore on foot. If walking isn't your thing you could also see something of the national park from the Brecon Mountain Railway. Castles, castles everywhere. Visit Caerphilly for sheer scale. Carreg Cennen for spectacular location. Dinefwr for a native Welsh castle. Raglan for a not-a-real-castle type of castle. Big Pit if you fancy disappearing down a coal mine for a couple of hours. Dan yr Ogof if you prefer a more natural subterranean experience. Tredegar House, Dyffryn Gardens and Margam Park to see how the gentry lived. The Glamorgan Heritage Coast and the Gower Peninsula for more walks and some spectacular coastal landscapes. Brecon for a handsome country town with plenty of interest in the vicinity. Hay-on-Wye for a truly unique place chock full of bookshops.  Caerleon and Caerwent for all things Roman. Caerwent was a Roman civitas - the tribal capital of the Silures - and still retains some impressive sections of the town wall. Excavations have also revealed the foundations of some shops and civic structures around the modern centre of the village. Caerleon (which comes from the Welsh for Fort of the Legion) is where you'll find the National Roman Legion Museum, as well as some pretty extensive remains including an amphitheatre and a baths complex.   I would recommend at least one day in a quieter part of Wales - most of the country is very different to the cramped valleys and coasts of the South-East. The area around Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire is packed with things to do. Carreg Cennen and Dinefwr castles - mentioned above, are nearby, along with Dinefwr House and park (a National Trust property) and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Llandeilo itself is a lovely little town, though there isn't much there, and the Tywi valley in which it is situated is just gorgeous (though perhaps less so on a rainy October afternoon!).  Hope you have a great time! One thing's certain: you won't run out of things to do."

Wales,3dr8zm,Kitchner,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:27:11 2015 UTC,"The original derivation of the word is not being disputed. In fact you could take it further: the first Greek scholars to describe the archipelago to a Mediterrancean audience - people like Pytheas of Massilia - also used archaic variations of Britain / Prydain.   That said, it's pretty indisputable that the word was adopted, and its meaning altered, by the English state in furtherance of its own geopolitical ambitions. The use of the term in its modern form was popularised by individuals such as John Dee, who was also keen to appropriate the Welsh mythos surrounding King Arthur to justify and advocate English rule over the entirety of Britain and Ireland. This was a well-established practise of the Tudor Court: Elizabeth I was at the same time using the legend of Prince Madog in territorial disputes with the Spanish over North America.  While the term was not invented by the English state, it's hardly true that it would today be used to describe the inhabitants of the UK without their intervention."

About 35% also included British as an identity, about 24% included English as an identity and 3% included other identities as well as Welsh.   Without access to the raw data I can't know for sure, but since only 65% of the population think of themselves as Welsh either on its own or with another identity, and then the large inclusion of English and British identities too, I don't think the majority of people in Wales described themselves as ""Welsh not british"" at all."

Wales,3dnx0t,shanfox89,2,Sat Jul 18 10:24:42 2015 UTC,"I went to St. Fagans a few days ago. There is a bus that departs from stand D1 at the central bus station which will bring you directly to the car park for the museum. I think that a round trip ticket was less than four pounds. It isn't part of the Cardiff Bus system but since the museum is free, it still makes for a cheap day out. I think that I leaves every half hour in the summer."

That must be worth the trip ;-) To be honest if you were driving I'd say yes, it's a nice little house with a lot of history. But it only is good for about 2 hours at the most and is a bit of a trek.... I'll leave that up to you.   Caerleon has a load of Roman ruins and a museum."

Again I don't agree with it. Again for the economic reasons. Stereotyping does no good.    What are your thoughts on the English buying houses in Wales and rocketing the prices?    Same   What are your thoughts on Englishmen/Women moving to Welsh speaking communities and helping erode our beautiful language?   Has nothing to do with the fact that they speak English and everything to do with the contempt of bilingualism.   Look, a lot of these things are a result of the economic differences between both countries. I said I'd prefer a federal-like ideal, mainly because of the resulting worsening off we'd be at this moment.

Wales,3dd7tt,HadrasVorshoth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:46:56 2015 UTC,I think you can get own brand spirits for about £10 a bottle in some places. Plus white cider can go as low as £2.50 for two litres at 7.5%. This seems to be more aimed at those that drink too much cheap alcohol. Rather than those who drink too much expensive alcohol.
Wales,3dd7tt,yrhendystu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:47:38 2015 UTC,In principal it's a good idea but the reality is that they need to go after the cheap and nasty stuff as that is what the majority of piss heads actually drink.  If they can do that without annoying the average person who doesn't want to pay £12+ for 12 cans of medium strength beer then it's all good.  This wont impact on those who get injured after getting tanked up on a night out as alcohol in bars is more expensive than in shops.

We got a nice spot on the beach & saw the Vulcan, Typhoon, Red Arrows (photos) etc.   The drive from Ogmore Vale to Fabian Way park & ride took 30 minutes. Then we had a 55 minute wait to get into the park & ride. There were 2 guys manning the entrance barrier. One wrote stuff on 2 tickets for us, took our £5, gave us verbal instructions, then pressed the button to raise the barrier. I don't know what the other guy was for. The bottleneck was due in part to that procedure, that I suspect could be streamlined, and also due to the single-server layout. The queue would move much faster if they had a second entrance barrier (& would give the other guy something to do!). Waiting for nearly an hour defeats a large part of the point of using park & ride. /grumble"

Wales,3cum1h,SirBlah,-2,Fri Jul 10 22:44:32 2015 UTC,Absolutely pathetic response. UFOs could be something simple like a local hobbyist launching a craft or a foreign aircraft. For them to reply with a made up alien language shows how immature the Welsh branch of London Labour really are.
Wales,3cum1h,yrhendystu,3,Sat Jul 11 17:02:56 2015 UTC,"What discussions has the Welsh government had with the Ministry of Defence regarding sightings of unidentified flying objects in Wales in each of the past five years?  What consideration has the Welsh government given to the funding of research into sightings of unidentified flying objects in Wales?   Must be that space-time rift in Cardiff Bay acting up again.  If there was a serious question about foreign or unknown aircraft flying around the airport then I imagine the Ministry of Defence would already know about it. Either Darren Millar's been watching far too much Doctor Who or it's his attempt at slagging off Labour's decision to buy the airport again.   Nevermind that if they didn't and instead let the previous owners shut it down few months later, you'd have the same people complaining that they didn't intervene.  Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer."
Wales,3cum1h,SirBlah,0,Sat Jul 11 19:07:43 2015 UTC,It still only mentions 'unidentified' and it's silly to jump to the conclusion this means other worldly.  I might be giving him too much credit but if I were him I'd first ask the same question to my London masters and then when I already know the answer I would then ask the Welsh Government.

There's no way you could march an army up there and have it ready to fight a battle the instant it reached the top, regardless of the hail of arrows, the about-face of his own archers and the trap Glyndwr sprung once battle was joined.  He was fucked right from the moment he decided to march his army up there. Look how steep it is."
Wales,3cvogv,KaiserMacCleg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:07:34 2015 UTC,Some think the Chartist march on Newport was a full on revolt.
Wales,3cvogv,remlap,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:10:58 2015 UTC,It was a revolt but it was localised and for only a few days. Plus it wasn't about Wales it was about workers rights. Same for the Merthyr Rising.  The Rebecca Riots were also revolts but again these were about rights and conditions not about Wales as a whole.
Wales,3cvogv,yrhendystu,3,Sat Jul 11 18:38:15 2015 UTC,Some in part of the march thought it was also for a Welsh republic. From what I've read each of the three columns coming down all had different idea on outcomes to the rising.

Wales,3cvogv,thewhiskybone,3,Sat Jul 11 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"An easy example is water.  Severn Trent currently steals water from Wales and sells it back to us for more than they sell it to their English customers. Whilst having token powers over water, Wales is not allowed to make any changes that affect how England is able to steal our water. This is set out in the Government of Wales act 2006 (put into place by Labour who were running UK and Wales back then)  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/section/152  152Intervention in case of functions relating to water etc.  (1)This section applies where it appears to the Secretary of State that the exercise of a relevant function (or the failure to exercise a relevant function) in any particular case might have a serious adverse impact on—  (a)water resources in England, (b)water supply in England, or (c)the quality of water in England.    Also MPs in Wales who represent British parties have on numerous occasions voted against fully devolving water, energy and The Crown Estates to Wales. They would rather follow the party whip and have our assets milked from London than used for the benefit of the people of Wales, ie the people who voted for them!"

Wales,3cfl9v,welshtux,-4,Tue Jul 7 20:42:35 2015 UTC,Here's their GE manifesto if you're interested.  https://issuu.com/ukip/docs/theukipmanifesto2015/1
Wales,3cfl9v,welshtux,7,Tue Jul 7 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"I've read the manifesto and the only policies specifically relating to Wales is to end the Barnett formula but with no concrete replacement, and quite frankly without EU funding or the formula Wales would go into sharp decline."
Wales,3cfl9v,RichieSM,-2,Tue Jul 7 21:18:18 2015 UTC,Mark Reckless is in the process of creating a manifesto tailored to Wales. I expect it will be released closer to the election date. Most likely 2-3 weeks before.  More info here: http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2015-06-27/mark-reckless-ukip-wales-policy-director-itv/
Wales,3cfl9v,BluePandaBear,6,Tue Jul 7 21:20:04 2015 UTC,So the leader of UKIP Wales is from England and the guy writing UKIP Wales' manifesto is from England.
Wales,3cfl9v,RichieSM,-1,Tue Jul 7 21:27:03 2015 UTC,"Yep.   The main reason for that is because he's a strong public speaker and a recognisable figure, being one of two MPs who defected to UKIP from the Tories last year.  He will be advised the entire time by Welsh UKIP party associates on local issues. He's not a stupid man and will campaign on behalf of you, your family, and my family who still live there in Cardiff and the Vale.  Don't mistake this campaign as an anti-EU message. John Redwood who is a very anti-EU Tory politician used to hold a rather prominent position in Welsh politics. And he wasn't Welsh either.  What UKIP will be doing is campaigning for localism. Sorting out hospitals, transport issues (and we all know how much that should be sorted), better refuse collection. That sort of thing. Things that matter to local people."
Wales,3cfl9v,BluePandaBear,3,Tue Jul 7 21:45:39 2015 UTC,"John Redwood who is a very anti-EU Tory politician used to hold a rather prominent position in Welsh politics. And he wasn't Welsh either.   Yeah, and he famously was caught mumbling and miming the national anthem as secretary of state for Wales because he couldn't be arsed to learn the words.  We've had enough English politicians badly representing Wales over the years."
Wales,3cfl9v,tyrroi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:53:53 2015 UTC,"I think youll find that most Welsh people don't know our anthem either, it's in a language 80% of us don't speak."
Wales,3cfl9v,RichieSM,0,Wed Jul 8 14:23:53 2015 UTC,We've had enough English politicians badly representing Wales over the years.   I know mate. I'm Welsh as I've explained and I'll be supporting the campaign. Providing advice where it's needed etc. The simple fact of the matter is that I don't see many Welsh politicians who are actually good at public speaking.  Leanne Wood is pathetic and mostly regurgitates the contents of the South Wales Echo whenever she's given a platform.  William Hague was pretty good but he's not Welsh either.  Who next? Charlotte Church? She's basically a female Russell Brand who's lost her thesaurus.
Wales,3cfl9v,SirBlah,-9,Tue Jul 7 22:03:08 2015 UTC,"We give more to the EU than we get back, so it's not a great argument to praise the EU for the allocation of our funds which we would be able to dish out appropriately without them."
Wales,3cfl9v,Zanza_N,6,Tue Jul 7 21:20:10 2015 UTC,"Right, because the UK government is definitely going to make up for that lost EU money. Sure.  Considering Wales is already underfunded, right now, I don't exactly have a lot of faith they'll do any of the sort, in fact I bet we'll never see that money again.  And wasn't one of UKIP's campaign messages that leaving the EU will save the UK billions of pounds of money? How can that be the case if much of that money saved will have to be instantly sent back to Wales, N. Ireland, Scotland and the poorer areas of England? That's not really saving money, is it?  All leaving the EU will do is make Wales more poorer then it already is, honestly."
Wales,3cfl9v,alun,0,Tue Jul 7 21:52:15 2015 UTC,"I think for now it'd be worth waiting to see their Welsh assembly manifesto when it comes out, UKIP being a relatively new party don't have much of a presence right now."

Wales,3cfl9v,Cleedo,6,Tue Jul 7 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be unfair to assume UKIP AMs would do this simply because some of them do it in Europe. Even then those in Europe do give speeches, vote and generally stay relevant.  I'd also expect them to take Wales more seriously as they obviously wish to stay a part of Wales, unlike the European Union."
Wales,3cfl9v,TeaDependant,0,Wed Jul 8 09:41:08 2015 UTC,"Why is that unfair? And why do they 'obviously' wish to stay part of Wales? They're a secessionary party, why wouldn't it be reasonable to expect them to believe in Welsh Independence / freeing England from Wales' debt obligations?"
Wales,3cfl9v,Zanza_N,4,Wed Jul 8 10:17:50 2015 UTC,If you're Welsh and you're considering voting UKIP you must be fucking retarded.    FTFY - it doesn't matter if you're Welsh or not. :)
Wales,3cfl9v,yrhendystu,3,Tue Jul 7 17:59:31 2015 UTC,"I'll raise the same question to you, why do you think this?"
Wales,3cfl9v,Cleedo,4,Wed Jul 8 09:41:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say the same for any British Nationalist party that takes its orders from London, not just UKIP."

Wales,3cfl9v,Cleedo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:59:37 2015 UTC,"Out of interest, why do you think that?"
Wales,3cfl9v,tyrroi,2,Wed Jul 8 09:38:56 2015 UTC,"The Conservatives destroyed Wales - like they destroyed a lot of mining communities. Therefore it's harder for right-wing parties to gain a foothold here. Traditionally because right-wing parties don't focus on creation of labour, which is realistically what Wales needs.  UKIP aren't and won't focus on the creation of new industries in Wales, they're too focused on wealth creation and asset management in large urban centres. They'll also focus on scrapping the Barnett formula, and leaving Europe, both of which would absolutely beggar Wales. Wales gets far more money from England and the EU than it could ever raise through tax - even if it had the power to change taxation - which it doesn't.    On top of that, UKIP would remove subsidies from a lot of industries that are some of the only ones left in Wales (for example Green Energy).   If you live in the South of England, which has a developed and strong economy that could benefit from leaving the EU and focus on wealth creation in urban centres then voting UKIP makes sense (assuming you're extremely short-sighted and selfish).   Not only this but let's not forget that UKIP has - at the very least - some very questionable policies (i.e being against gay marriage) as well as councillors that have said openly homophobic and racist remarks, as well as having several people suspended from the party for saying things that may not reflect party policy, but definitely belies the personal politics of the kind of people it attracts.   If you want to sink Wales, give it less money, destroy its NHS, internal transport systems and already precarious economy, by all means vote UKIP. If you want Wales to move forward, do some more research."

I'm a council ward representative for UKIP in Ealing Broadway (London) but Welsh born and bred - Vale of Glam and Cardiff to be precise. Lived there for 33 years.  The South Wales region is going to be highly targeted by UKIP because the party knows it is second in most of those areas and with the PR system of the Welsh Assembly they will most likely get a ton of seats.  To get to the point, you should be prepared to see a lot of political posting early next year from all sides even though you're a small sub. The political machine from all parties will be watching what happens in Wales.  The advice you give is good though, and I can tell you're a good mod.

Say they vote to cut a service by 10% in E&W, the bloc grants given out is based on how much money is spent in the 4 countries.

How could anything get done?  And surely due to the Barnett Formula even ""English-only"" laws can have a knock-on effect to the funding outside England.  The whole thing is a mess, a little bandage which doesn't really solve the problem that's there's no democratic separation between England and the UK, both of which share a political system rather then England having it's own. There really needs to be an English Parliament, and a separate (and probably smaller) UK parliament, a separate institution, in separate buildings with separate members."

Wales,3bn56f,SirBlah,7,Tue Jun 30 15:43:13 2015 UTC,"From the article:   A £600m next phase of the Metro integrated transport network for South Wales will be confirmed today by Welsh Government Minister Edwina Hart. This will include addressing the key question of what form of transport will be used on the Valley Lines, as well as the type of not for profit company that will take forward delivery of the Metro, alongside the Wales & Borders Rail franchise, which is being devolved from 2018. Mrs Hart is also expected to reference Transport for London, which has responsibility for the London Underground, bus regulation and increasingly elements of the capital’s heavy rail infrastructure, as a model to aspire to. The Welsh Government has deliberately not explicitly set out the form of transport, which are light rail [tram] or heavy rail, it would like to see operate on the various Valley Lines into Cardiff – or indeed a combination of the two. Consideration will also be given to aligning bus services to Metro services. “Metro aspires for at least four services per hour at the network periphery, increasing over time as demand dictates.” Currently from locations such as Aberdare and Merthyr there are only between one to two services per hour into Cardiff – taking at least an hour. A tram service could reduce journey times from Merthyr to Cardiff by around 20 minutes and with a service of one every 15."

Wales,3bcyaj,quantumpenguins,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"For ""left from glamorgan"", do you mean West Glamorgan? Cuz that's where I'm from!  I live on a peninsular called the Gower, just south of Swansea City.  We've got a bunch of villages of various sizes, beaches on all sides, and a tourist industry big enough to be established without being oppressive.  If you're interested in heritage,  we have a small museum/park type thing called the heritage centre.  Local food and drink, an old working water mill, it's a nice place to just wander around and soak in.  The Gower was the first place in Wales to be dubbed a place of Outstanding Natural Beauty - there are some fantastic walks and we have some gorgeous scenery.  A lot of places are quite expensive here, but we have two Youth Hostels which are really nice, and good if you're on a budget, and they're both right on a beach.  Beginning of August there's a massive agricultural show here. As well as all the animals, there's a funfair, local food, just a lot of culture.

Hopefully I can visit, my family in general including myself has taken a keen interest in who we are.  And the history of the surname that I carry has remained the biggest mystery. I would like to experience a bit of what Wales is like.  I hate to sound like just another curious American, I know y'all probably get a lot of that.  Nonetheless, I hope I can find an extended period to visit Wales perhaps this month."
Wales,3bcyaj,quantumpenguins,0,Sun Jun 28 15:57:08 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  And I understand the interest in family history - my mum has recently been delving into it. Must be harder living the the ""new world"" though as your roots lie so far away.  Williams is a really popular Welsh surname. I think (now I heard this on the radio, dont take it as gospel) it's due to the fact that in Wales's history, family names came in all of a sudden - before that, people just used their given name. If clarity was needed, they would use their name followed by ""ap"" + their father's name.  When people had to chose a surname, many people just dropped the connective and adopted their father's name. As a result, ""ap John"" became Jones, ""ap Evan"" became Evans,  ""ap Dafydd"" became Davies... you get the idea. As a result, simply tracing the ""Williams"" family may be difficult as it is such a popular surname.  And the wish to explore your history is perfectly valid - no one tends to mind people, not least Americans, tracing their roots. If anything, we tend to enjoy people taking an interest in Welsh culture, as Wales gets swept under the rug quite a lot.   As you may find out, Welsh folk are pretty friendly! Most of us, anyway. I've never been anywhere else where a total stranger can chat with you like they've known you all their lives. So don't be embarrassed about being American, people will probably find you interesting if anything."
Wales,3bcyaj,haloraptor,0,Sun Jun 28 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Hopefully I can find something Welsh to send to my father.  Unlike my mother's family who have close links to England and even the American Revolution, my Dad always thinks his family were just dirt poor farmers.  I think he would like to take some pride in where his roots come from.  I watched a programme recently on Welsh migration to Argentina, which I found fascinating.  Apparently these men and women went in an effort to preserve their culture and language.  I think my father (and I) would like to take some pride in our Welsh ancestry too. ;)"

Wales,3b3no0,UCBearcats,12,Thu Jun 25 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"You're a bit stuck as you're going through a small corridor in a tiny part of Wales, however...  Branch off the M4 motorway just North of Bristol on the English side of the border for the M48 (you're going to get dicked for £7 at either bridge getting in to Wales) and have a look around Chepstow. A small but pretty former Roman port town, Chepstow Castle ruins are worth a nose around. Pick up a Manic Street Preachers or Stereophonics CD to add to the experience.  At this point if you have half a day free, you can venture north along the A469 to Monmouth along the beautiful Wye valley, visiting Tintern Abbey a few miles north of Chepstow. Monmouth itself is a very affluent town just a few miles inside the Welsh border, and just up the A40 to the west is Raglan with its' castle, before arriving in Abergavenny twelve miles later, a pretty market town with a castle ruin. Up the other side of the Blorenge mountain is Blaenavon with Big Pit - a museum paying homage to the massive mining industry of the last 150 years. Hammer back down the A4042 to rejoin the M4.  Whether you took the diversion North or not, pop across to Caerleon just north of Newport to visit the Roman ampitheatre and take in the semi-rural affluence, then jump back on to the M4, through the Brynglas Tunnels to the outskirts of our fine capital. Don't take jcn 29 for the A48 as it's a featureless road in - continue on to Taff's Well or Culverhouse Cross. From here, I'm sure one of our Caerdydd residents will happily pick up the slack.  That, or just go straight to Cardiff. I know I'm biased, but it's the best city in the world. You'll enjoy yourself!"
Wales,3b3no0,RomeroGoon,5,Thu Jun 25 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"Thats a top recommendation! If time is limited I'd recommend a shorter loop: off at Chepstow, up the Wye valley stopping at Tintern, then continuing to Monmouth and back down the A40/A449 to pick up the M4 again at Newport. That'll add about an hour plus any stopping time to your journey."

Wales,3azqgz,SirBlah,6,Wed Jun 24 20:26:13 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty significant step for the Traws Link Cymru campaign, which has been campaigning to reopen this line and the line between Porthmadog and Bangor, so that there's a route for trains from Cardiff and Swansea to go directly upwards to Aberystwyth, and from there potentiality continuing up to North Wales along the western coast. (And the other way around of course.)  Map of the proposals."
Wales,3azqgz,Deeside420,7,Wed Jun 24 20:38:54 2015 UTC,"I'd love it if this went ahead, but I'd be totally shocked if they decided re-opening this line would be cost effective.  If by some miracle, they also re-opened the line to Bangor, I still don't think there's anything to be gained from an extra North-South service. Trains can travel much faster on the longer route through England than they would on this line.  The current journey time from Bangor to Cardiff is 3h 58m, going via England.  Look at the route map posted, a train from Porthmadog to Machynlleth takes nearly 2 hours. So does Carmarthen to Cardiff. So if you teleport nearly 50% of the proposed North - South route, you've matched the current journey time.  Yes, it would be a godsend for the likes of Tregaron, Pen-y-Groes and Aberystwyth. But it'd also be very expensive. I'd imagine it's not even close to economically viable at the moment, before the whole ""Welsh Assembly only care about Cardiff bla bla"" stuff.  Having said all that, someones spending 50 fucking billion pounds building High Speed 2. With that in mind, there's no reason not to reinstate these lines. I'd like a North South motorway too please following the A494 / A470"
Wales,3azqgz,redditthrowaway1995,7,Wed Jun 24 22:50:27 2015 UTC,"It depends on how it's built really, the main problem is that the Cambrian Coast Line is very slow, partly because the trains themselves are slow and stop at nearly every station, they have to slow down over level crossings (and there's loads of them) and because the track itself isn't really built for trains to run at high speed, but hopefully those are things that can be improved.  Personally though, if there's ever to be a proper north to south line it'll have to follow the route of the A470 (which itself roughly follows the route of part of the old Mid Wales line), so trains going from Cardiff though Brecon, Builth Wells, Rhayader, Llandloes, then continuing to follow the A470 to Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llandudno Junction. Build it correctly and that would be about 250km long, compared to the current journey which is about 290km. The current line from North to South isn't really very fast anyway, and has to stop and reverse though Chester, so anything could probably be built better then that."

Booking train journeys in advance from a site like National Rail can give you a much cheaper fare. Have a great trip!"
Wales,3akcfr,Trallwn14,2,Sun Jun 21 06:57:39 2015 UTC,"This is great advice, particularly booking in advance - it can save significant amounts.

Wales,3akcfr,firstLOL,2,Sun Jun 21 08:38:03 2015 UTC,It's worth taking a look at megabus gold to see if they cover any of your journeys. Megabus is generally a pain because it's horrible and cramped and takes forever but the gold service involves a lovely bus with loads of space (like a first class train carriage) and included refreshments. They don't do the gold service on all their routes but it's way cheaper than an equally long train journey and much nicer.

You can probably find a route to all the places you've mentioned using either, although i would expect longer distance train journeys to be more expensive.   For the longer journies (for example from liverpool to pembrokeshire) you will probably want to use a train route for the sake of comfort.   I would probably advise researching what routes are available and if and when you may have to switch to get to certain places once you know where you're going.

Cable Bay has an prehistoric burial mound that's worth visiting. There's an old abandoned manison in Beaumaris called the Baron Hill Estate it's pretty hard to find though.

Wales,3ae17d,WhyArrest,7,Fri Jun 19 10:33:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's ridiculous  that the Labour MPs for Islwyn and Blaenau Gwent are backing Liz Kendall.  They represent solidly left leaning areas and are supporting a Blairite.  If she wins she'll be the most right-wing leader Labour's ever had.  She even mentioned breaking links with the trade unions.  The party might as well dissolve under her because it won't stand for anything anymore.    I wouldn't mind Yvette Cooper winning.  I like Corbyn a lot but he doesn't seem to have much of a chance and his views on Hamas and Hezbollah are questionable.  I don't like Burnham very much, he has all the charisma of a damp rag."

Kendall is in the wrong party - plain and simple. If you thought Blair was right-wing, you ain't seen nothing yet.  That leaves Burnham and Cooper. Neither are particularly inspiring figures but both have solid track-records in Government.

Wales,3a2340,tyrroi,-2,Wed Jun 17 11:02:51 2015 UTC,Everyone knows this is coming.  Wales has 22 councils for 3 million people whilst Birmingham has 1.  I think Cardiff should stand on its own though as it's the capital.
Wales,3a2340,BluePandaBear,7,Tue Jun 16 19:49:35 2015 UTC,"And at the other end of the scale, there's Austria, a country of 8.6 million people that is divided into 2,357 municipalities (2,358 including Vienna, which is a special case) with a councillor for every 150 people. Let's not pretend that Wales is the exception to the rule here. Birmingham is an exception. So is Austria.  I must say that I'm really not sold on this. I've never heard an argument put together that doesn't amount to vague, unsubstantiated allusions to waste and inefficiency."

Wales,39tvmp,7ARedd,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"A few questions to give us an idea. What exchange are you running off, and how far away is it from your house. Also, don't listen to their fibre optic estimates, the cables run through my village to get to the next one (where they have fibre) but the date has repeatedly been pushed back and my roadside cabinet is now ""under review."""
Wales,39tvmp,Pavilo_Olson,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by 'what exchange' - but my best understanding of the question: it's a large metal box on the roadside, atop a hill leading down to the village, and we're about half a mile or less or so away from it, in the middle of fields.  If you need any more info/if I've not given you a proper answer, please let me know. Thanks for posting.  EDIT: Just to add regarding roadside cabinets, we don't have one for our own personal connection. It comes off a pole, and goes to a small box under the eaves of the outside of the house. In case this is of any help."
Wales,39tvmp,w0ss4g3,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:02:51 2015 UTC,Your local telephone exchange: stick your postcode in here and it'll tell you.
Wales,39tvmp,Wayitsray,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"Go to this site http://dslchecker.bt.com/adsl/ADSLChecker.address and that should give you a guide as to what speeds you should be able to receive through fibre (at the top) and standard Adsl (bottom part)  A couple initial things to check are: The router is connected to the master socket No damaged wires Adsl filters on all phones (unless you have a VDSL(2) master socket)  You could also try these things: Go to your routers homepage (type this into the website bar -  192.168.0.1) not sure what it looks like for Talk Talk but reboot the router to see if it can kick start it to get your advertised speeds   Also while on the homepage of the router try changing the WiFi channel, it's probably set to automatic, but usually channel 1, 6 or 11 are the best. There's a program that can scan for other WiFi in the area and will tell you what channel they are using the you choose a different one so they are not conflicting!"
Wales,39tvmp,Wayitsray,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"Also I remember when I was stuck with adsl and I heard about the superfast Cymru initiative, and when it came to my area I jumped straight into it and got fibre to the cabinet, I went from a lousy 3mbps to nothing special but a lot better 20mbps! If you haven't already search Google for the superfast cymru website to see if they give you a date for when you'll get fibre!  An exchange is where the cabling for telephone lines start, it's then copper wire all the way to the road site cabinets and from there to the telephone poles outside of the houses is also copper wire, then you get FTTC which is fibre to the cabinet, that's what it says it is, literally from the exchange to the cabinet is fibre then from the cabinet to the home is copper wire. Then there's FTTP, fibre to the premises, that's fibre directly from the exchange to the house! (Provides ridiculous speeds)  Sorry for the bombardment of information but I can't get to sleep ha"
Wales,39tvmp,Pavilo_Olson,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:36:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply and info.  I'm not sure if the info provided by the the dslchecker will be of much help, as I have had an 'acceptable' service shall we say in the past, such as the random highest download rate we've had as 600 kb/s or so, but has been very choppy and unreliable, dropping below 100 kb/s as if it has a mind of it's own. That and I can't get the link to work as well lol - I'm not sure if I've gone down that route as well in the past though, and were given some brilliant statistics, but in reality, had nothing near what they said I was supposed to get.  Master socket - I am not sure we have one? I looked into them, and if I understand correctly, they have an inbuilt test socket? None of our sockets have those. We have been using the socket in the living room for our main landline use and where the router is connected to, and dub that as the 'master socket'. It's also where BT engineers have come to check for faults in the past as well, and the same socket that was 'fried' with lightning a while back, but since replaced.  Router related/rebooting - wouldn't a physical reboot (turn off and on) be enough for this? If so, we've done that many many times, and it doesn't seem to have any affect at all. We've had to do it more frequently lately, due to what we call the 'yellow triangle of death' appearing on our computer's network status on the desktop. Sometimes it tends to kick the internet off when the phone goes as well, that's something new that's only started happening a few weeks ago.  Wifi - wifi related stuff doesn't really apply to us, as we use wired connections from all PC's and devices to the router, with exception of the one or two tablets that are connected via wi-fi occasionally, but not on all the time. Even when they are off, and it's just one computer on the network at the same time, there is no difference in the poor speeds.  Regarding Superfast Cymru, I think we tried to apply for that or at least show interest in it. Like yourself, we'd jump on the chance for fibre optic when it was available, but I can't quite remember how that went. I believe we were rejected, or told that the area was still 'under review' or something, and it never came to light - still waiting.  I'm a bit confused with the exchange then lol, as I'd always thought the big metal box was the exchange, could that be the roadside cabinet then? Though, that box seems to supply telephone connection to the whole village by my understanding. There's always a member of BT there at least once a week or two fiddling with the enormous amount of tiny wires inside it.  Thanks for advice so far again, and thanks again for taking time to comment. Very appreciated, and appreciate any further help you can provide."
Wales,39tvmp,Pavilo_Olson,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:02:53 2015 UTC,"It really does sound like a fault on the line here between the cabinet and your house. It's frustrating to deal with them but phoning talktalk and telling them you've had ongoing issues for months with no resolution, and that your like fit them to get BT to send an engineer out. Be firm and forceful but not aggressive.  Master socket is where the external wire comes comes into your house, filtered or not. You can find your exchange by googling ""Samknows"" and putting your postcode/phone number in there."
Wales,39tvmp,w0ss4g3,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:05:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment.  I was afraid of that, as we've been in several different forms of contact with them over the past few years with this same issue and resolved very little. The latest 'success' we had was them eventually sending an engineer over to have a look at things. The guy from TalkTalk arrived and got to work doing a speed test using the Ookla site (which I'd also used and could have told him the results before he bothered) as well as a TalkTalk official looking page. He tried 3 different TalkTalk routers - ours that we currently use not being one of theirs, but one we had to buy due to replacements, we've never had an ISP's official router.   Two of the three routers, which he freshly unboxed, apparently 'died' upon connecting to the house, while the third TalkTalk router displayed same speeds as the one we had used. The engineer concluded that it was a fault on the lines, and that he would pass the report on to BT to get it looked at. We haven't heard anything from BT for many many months now.  To add, in our recent call up to TalkTalk about 4 or 5 months back now, we enquired yet again on the progress of fault, and we were given yet another answer - as apparently stating that our router wasn't compatible with their 'systems' and they would send us one of their TalkTalk routers free of charge in the post, that we're still waiting for. Even then, if it did arrive, if they tested 3 of their TT official routers when the engineer was over here and none of them made any difference, what would be the point in sending over a 4th?  Our faith in TalkTalk is practically non existent at this stage. I can predict there will be a back and forth between them and BT when next time we call, with TT likely to say ""it's in BT's hands, talk to them about it"" and we contact BT only for them to say the reverse. So frustrating.  We haven't had much luck with BT in the past either. When one of the cables went down in the field, we were without a phone or internet connection for 3 months before they sent a team to fix it. Despite calling them every other day. They sent 4 reps over those 3 months to just look at it and go ""there's your problem"" and only after the 4th did a team finally show up to set up a temporary thin shoestring like line - which we had to use for two years before they came to put in a proper thick phone cable in place and pick up the old one that was still in the field.  I'm at this point in thinking they have different categories for priorities. Such as, if you live in a town/city, you'd be much higher on the list of 'get things done', but if you're out in the wilds and surrounded by fields like we are, you're very much bottom of the barrel.  Thanks again for the post and taking time to read/comment. Very appreciate."
Wales,39tvmp,w0ss4g3,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:41:44 2015 UTC,"Just to add regarding fault on line between house and cabinet -   Our nearest neighbours get their phone/internet from the same line, but they don't seem to have any issues, reporting an apparent steady 1mb/s. Our line that comes to the house branches off to 2 or 3 other poles before reaching us. So there could be a fault on the lines from those poles, or, could it be a fault on our specific serving line going down to the village, while our neighbour's one remains unaffected?  Another fact to add about the TalkTalk engineer: I had asked what we were supposed to be getting as speeds, and he said 7mbs. I asked if he meant 7 megabytes a second, or 7 megabits. He said megabytes. But I am not sure if fibre optic around these parts can provide such high a speed?  Another theory I have regarding TalkTalk is that prior to them being our ISP we had a deal with Tiscali, which were then bought out I believe by TalkTalk, and that we may still be on the old Tiscali package from many years ago - and being charged the same amount for less of a service, effectively paying more for less by today's standards. Yet they insist it has no effect."
Wales,39tvmp,w0ss4g3,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:51:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, yeah that's certainly not internal wiring causing the issue. I'm sure you've tried connecting it direct to the master socket test port (when you unscrew it) with a filter? Just to be sure. If that gives nothing then you can be 100% sure its their fault, and you need to pester them every four or so days with a call."
Wales,39tvmp,w0ss4g3,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:55:18 2015 UTC,"A note on your fault reporting to BT/Talktalk.  If TalkTalk provide your broadband, then they alone can take up faults with BT (Wholesale and Openreach). You can't - when you ring BT (Retail), they're effectively a different company, so they won't have a clue and will probably confuse you. All of your broadband-related fault queries must go through TalkTalk.. so if they've said BT are investigating then you need to get them to chase the outcome. They are also responsible for organising any engineer visits if they're required.  You may well be better off switching to another provider with a better fault-handling reputation, assuming you're not locked into some contract with TalkTalk."

Wales,39plpy,ManOfManyTentacles,8,Sat Jun 13 14:53:33 2015 UTC,"Howdy, boyo! I'll throw in my two cents.  1) If there's 1 things the Welsh love, it's drinking. And rugby. 2 things. Oh and singing. If there's 3 things the Welsh love, it's drinking, rugby and singing. Especially all at the same time. So come St.David's day, enjoying at least 2 of those is a must. And welsh cakes. 4 things.  2) (northern) irish nationalism has always been a contentious, sometimes violent issue, fuelled by religious difference. Scottish nationalism has dominated the headlines recently due to some wanting independence. Wales has its own Assembly/local government which has done much to quell dissenting voices, but there are still many people who seem to believe Wales should separate from the UK. It's a touchy subject.  3) there is very little irish culture in the states from my experience, but a bizarre amalgamation of different Celtic cultures under the umbrella term 'irish' which is just an excuse to drink (which is great). St.Patrick day corners the market in the public consciousness for a celtic celebration. Which is a shame, as the welsh impact on the US is hugely overlooked, from the huge mining communities, to much of New York's character (e.g Elis Island, Grand Central station) to many of the president who were from welsh stock (Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, even Obama apparently).  4) ""little nation""!? We're...perfectly formed, thankyouverymuch.  Traditionally, the North is where welsh is more widely spoken. Having said that, I live in Cardiff and find myself speaking welsh a lot of the time as there's a strong welsh community here. Castles you'll find everywhere (I may be wrong but I think we have the most castles per square mile in the world). The beauty of being a small perfectly formed nation is everything is just a couple of hours drive away at most, whether its the mountains, the castles or the stunning coast.  So if you ever make it over here, let us know! The first 15 drinks are on us.  Iechyd da!"
Wales,39plpy,Muridae,5,Sat Jun 13 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"Traditionally, the North is where welsh is more widely spoken.   Or more specifically, the north-west. Welsh is about as widely spoken here in Wrexham as it is in Cardiff. The language is strongest in Gwynedd and Anglesey, (particularly places like Caernarfon, Bala and the Llŷn Peninsula), where it's the first language of the majority."
Wales,39plpy,KaiserMacCleg,8,Sun Jun 14 08:15:43 2015 UTC,"1) St David was a sober vegetarian, so just be really sober and avoid meat and you'll be honouring him! To be honest unless you are religious or in school, St David's day is no big deal. Mostly because it's in the 6 Nations. Get into rugby union.  2) the old name for welsh is British. We were on this island first, I don't blame the Irish and Scots for wanting to leave, but we'll be here last, the English can leave if they like.  3) lots of welsh to America, but we had a really strong economy back in the day, so at the height of immigration into the U.S., the 2nd height was to Wales. As such emigrates didn't 'carry the culture' like others did  4) small country, go everywhere."
Wales,39plpy,Inversesnob,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:04:15 2015 UTC,"Welsh are good at drinking. Just looked up some stats and apparantly 19% of Wales ""binge drink"". Unfortunately we don't make the best drinks Brains is our biggest international brand of beer and its a pile of shit. There are a few decent breweries (especially in Wrexham and the Valley/South Wales area) but I doubt there isn't much internal demand. So if you ever come around then just grab a local beer and see if you like it or not. If you like whisky then check out some of the Penderyn stuff. Unlike Brains its actually good. So just drink what ever you want, as long as its in excess.   Food wise the Welsh don't really do much either. As North Walian currently living in South I have found people are much more about welsh cakes down south and I had more in my three years here than I have had in my life beofre hand. The only other food I can think of is Welsh Rarebit which may not even be welsh, leek soup, and laverbread which is all pretty homely food and nothing worth bragging about. I will give a shoutout to Snowdonia Chesse though, its good fucking cheese!  The most unifying part of wales of Wales is the rugby (even if south wales does take all the glory :P). Who doesn't love a good game of rugby union? And the songs we sing are great; bread of heaven, Delilah, and I geunally belive that the Welsh national anthem is one of the bets in the world, probably in the top 5.   In terms of nationalism I hardly ever refer to myself as British, and always say Welsh when I can. I don't really wanted to be lumped in the English and avoid it when I can. Plus has always a friendly rivalry  between the English and Welsh.   According to Wikipedia USA was a 0.6% population of Welsh-American and a 10.5% Irish-american population, that's just not worth making a fuss about. Welsh cultural events include the Six Nations and that's pretty much it. In my experience very few people care about dydd gwyl dewi sant, the eisteddfod, or dydd santes dwynwen. Seen much more welsh people celebrate saint paddy's day.  Unfortunately welsh is a dying language so not many people speak it with  ~20% of the country being able to speak it. Most of it is around the western edge of wales so if you want to experience that then that's the place to go. Wales is smaller than New Jersey so if that seems small to you then you could easily visit the entire country over a relatively short period. It takes about 3.5 hours to go from north wales to south on the train so its not that big a place. It would like to highlight some places. Cardiff obviously being the capital city and one of the only places welsh money goes to, or more specifically Cardiff Bay. There should be plenty of stuff to look at online if you want to visit. Like /u/XUD9TE suggested Anglesy is a fabulas place to go. There are some great places to visit but I don't know if it could keep anyone entertained for more than a day or two. I would recommend places like Llangollen, Llandudno, Harlech, Bala, and defo go take a trip to Snowdon. If you like castles then the ones that standout to me are Cardiff Castle,  Conwy Castle, and Caerphilly Castle which has a tower that leans twice as much as Pisa and I think its regularly ignored as being one of the largest castles in the world."
Wales,39plpy,Alunnite,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:31:48 2015 UTC,"why do you think there's very little in the way of welsh culture in the US compared to being irish?   There was the Welsh Tract in Pennsylvania but Wales's most successful colony was probably Y Wladfa in Patagonia (in the Americas, just not in your bit).  In addition to others' suggestions, the eisteddfod is pretty much unique to Wales and it seems it may be spreading in your general direction. It might be worth investigating AmeriCymru to see if there's anything going on near you."

Wales,39bs9p,colonelcardiffi,2,Sat Jun 13 08:39:34 2015 UTC,What has this flag got to do with Cardiff at all? I don't like it one bit.
Wales,39bs9p,joethepro36,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"Based on Cardiff's current flag, three nested hexagons are built from the chevronels from the flag of Glamorgan. This image recalls the form of walled forts from Cardiff's ancient history, and denotes Cardiff's status as the capital city (one can imagine, on a map of Wales, towns labelled with one hex, cities labelled with two, and the capital, Cardiff, labelled with three, as seen here).  So, yes, it is a bit more subtle than a dragon and a leek and a flag, on a flag..."
Wales,39bs9p,SimonJ57,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:27:59 2015 UTC,My honest opinion is that its awful and does not represent the city well. The logo for Cardiff Council is in my opinion far better.
Wales,39bjhg,Malthus0,8,Wed Jun 10 17:23:44 2015 UTC,"i dont think they should be banned outright. but putting a similar law in place to the smoking ban would make a lot of sense. why should everyone else in the office/bar/room be subjected to it too?  they arent nearly as offensive as regular cigarettes, sure, but they still produce a smell. whenever my housemate used to vape the room would just get this really stale smell.   the worst was he used to blow the vapour in peoples faces if they complained then laugh, and hes not the only person i know who would do that. 'its only water vapour!' no, its water vapour with nicotine and other shit added to it, not to mention the fact that its just circulated through your lungs two seconds ago, picking up any bacteria on the way out before you blew it around the room.   basically i think its great if its better for people, and even if it isnt you should be free to do whatever the fuck you want. its a frew country and youre free to do whatever you want. but once that extends to expecting a room full of other people, who are just trying to have a nice night, to put up with it what you want to do as well? theres a distinct line thats been crossed there, and people shouldnt be expected to just put up with it.   just smoke/vape outside."

Wales,391v48,KaiserMacCleg,2,Mon Jun 8 17:29:09 2015 UTC,You'd be lucky if the election featured in the narrative at all. It's more than likely it would be utterly drowned out by the cacophony being raised by the UK media about the referendum.
Wales,391v48,BluePandaBear,3,Tue Jun 9 17:02:04 2015 UTC,You'd need a political earthquake to remove Labour from government in Wales.  You'd need Con and UKIP to win more seats than Labour which isn't going to happen.
Wales,391v48,SirBlah,5,Mon Jun 8 21:02:32 2015 UTC,"I could only begin to imagine the uproar of a Tory-UKIP coalition in the Assembly, just the idea of the Tory party leading Wales would be unthinkable for most people.  But I would be honestly terrified of the damage UKIP, an anti-devolutionist party, could do if they had any power in Wales. They might have softened their stance a little since 2010 when they wanted to get rid of Assembly members entirely, but they still seam to oppose any more devolution in Wales and any of the other nations (other then England of course!).  When UK-wide constitutional reform is at the utter most importance, we'll have a party that is both campaigning for less devolution in Wales, while at the same time in England campaigning for an English-only parliament, or for second class Welsh/Scottish/N. Irish MPs though EVEL."
Wales,391v48,BluePandaBear,3,Mon Jun 8 23:02:33 2015 UTC,I really can't image a rise in Con in Wales after a whole year under the new government. Personally I hope for a rise in PC and believe they would work closely with Labour in the Assembly.

Wales,391guh,BigHowski,2,Mon Jun 8 18:12:19 2015 UTC,"Seconded.  This comment is about trains.  Unlike many countries, there is a variety of train operators, and each has a different policy regarding bikes.  TL;DR you can take your bike for free, but it's best if you reserve a bike space.  I suggest getting acquainted with First Great Western's bike reservations for the trip down from London Paddington.  All train services to Cardiff and Swansea are provided by First Great Western.  Most do not require reservations for taking your bike, but a small amount of trains do - better safe than sorry.  PDF Link.  Inside Wales, almost all trains are run by Arriva Trains Wales, a different company.  They're stricter with the number of bikes on their services (smaller trains), so I'd book as far in advance as you can.  Link.  Virgin Trains also operate a few services in the north.  Here's their policy.    EDIT: expansion and clarification"

Wales,38li2e,SirBlah,3,Fri Jun 5 00:04:28 2015 UTC,"So I stumbled upon this rather interesting tweet a while ago with says:    A student from Leeds won the competition to design a Parliament House in 1926. Space had been allocated in Cardiff    Along with the drawing, showing a much grander Catheys Park then what was eventually built. But the most interesting part is this massive parliament building at the end of the Park, which is surprising. Was Welsh home rule something legitimately being discussed back in 1926?  ...although I think if they were going to build that thing back then, then I think it would of been better if it had been front and centre where the City Hall is rather then stuffed at the back in that awkward position. anyway.  Edit: Would be interesting to see if there's any information about 'the competition', was it a informal exercise or something a bit more then that? And if there's any more detailed drawings of the building, or designs from the other entrants."
Wales,38li2e,KaiserMacCleg,3,Fri Jun 5 00:06:22 2015 UTC,"Was Welsh home rule something legitimately being discussed back in 1926?   Well, Lloyd George was a well known advocate of home rule for Wales as well as for Ireland. Some time earlier, before the turn of the twentieth century, he was a prominent member of Cymru Fydd, an organisation with the express intent of securing Welsh home rule.  That ambition seems to have been lost later in his political life, particularly during his tenure as Prime Minister (understandably, given the considerable pressures of the day).  Cymru Fydd had died back by the twenties. Labour and the Liberals accomodated calls for Welsh home rule to a degree, though as far as I'm aware they never explicitely supported the position as parties. 1925 saw the founding of Plaid Cymru, who would gradually gain traction over the following decades.  I'd love to know more about that picture, though. Perhaps it was nothing more than a contest for a newspaper.  It's a shame that Cathays Park never got that grand, though I still think it's an enormous asset for Cardiff and one of the finest examples of Edwardian architecture and planning anywhere in Britain."
Wales,38li2e,yrhendystu,2,Fri Jun 5 00:45:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was reading up on Cymru Fydd a while back, it's a bit of a shame it never really went anywhere, but then again it seams like the concept of Welsh devolution/home rule is something that's only really gotten popular support in the last few decades.  I'm kind of leaning towards this being some contest organised by either a newspaper (Western Mail maybe?) or from the Eisteddfod, especially seeing as the tweet was from the National Eisteddfod's Visual Arts account, I think. Maybe I'll send them a tweet about it."
Wales,38li2e,KaiserMacCleg,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:59:58 2015 UTC,The Liberals have a long history of wanting home rule and an equally long history of shafting us the minute that London comes calling.  Lloyd George and T E Ellis are both examples of this.  Just imagine how much better off Wales could have been if we had a Parliament back then. Even some form of devolution could have protected. Perhaps invested much of the wealth we had stolen and even prevented some of the events to come such as Aberfan and Tryweryn. Prevented or limited the ongoing colonisation from white flight settlers and turning our seaside towns into dumping grounds for English junkies and paedos.
Wales,38li2e,yrhendystu,4,Sat Jun 6 07:35:29 2015 UTC,"It's sad to think that many of the problems that Wales suffers from could of been migrated or avoided completely if we had a parliament (with power) around the 1920's or earlier.  If the language policies of today had been enacted back then, along with Welsh medium schools, then the language would be in a far stronger position ...maybe even the majority language today? Like it is in Quebec for example.  As you mentioned Tryweryn would have never happened, not sure about Aberfan but I guess that depends on whether the ""Welsh Coal Board"" had the same management problems that the National Coal Board had in reality.  Speaking about coal, if the parliament had control of energy and natural resources then much of the money raised by the industry could have stayed in Wales rather then going straight to Westminister.  And then the big one - Thatcher wouldn't have been able to close the mines. Now I have no doubt that eventually many of them would have closed, that's the inevitability of mining a non-renewable fuel, but it would have been a process, and it would have been a far more moderate approach; smaller mines closed down and the workforce consolidated into larger and more profitable mines, while the Welsh Government would have probably tried to get other alternative industries to slowly take their place. Not the dangerous, authoritarian, slash and burn approach that Thatcher took. In the end, like Tower Colliery I imagine many of the larger coal mines might have continued running right into the 2000s, maybe even today.  Edit: And another thing, depending on the Welsh Government of the day the Beeching Cuts might of not have happened, meaning among others the Carmarthen to Aber Line wouldn't have closed and it would still be possible to travel from North to South Wales without having to go though England.  Oh well, I guess we have to work with what we've got nowadays. Maybe in decades time Wales will be at a more economically sustainable place. Maybe."
Wales,38li2e,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Sat Jun 6 14:12:40 2015 UTC,"Welsh history is a long list of ""if only..."" situations.   Not that it would have been all sunshine and roses - de-industrialisation was on its way regardless.  The turn of the twentieth century must have been a pretty exciting time for nation builders in Wales. There was a revival of Welsh culture going on - the National Eisteddfod was still a relatively new institution (1860s), and there was a lot of interest in Welsh history coming out of London-based societies like the Cymmrodorion (revived in the 1870s). The University of Wales was founded in 1893, the National Museum in 1905 and the National Library in 1907. In 1914, the Church was disestablished in Wales - certainly the biggest single change to Welsh public life to have been brought about by an act of parliament since the annexation, and a significant departure from the established order in England.  And all the while, the cause of Welsh home rule was gaining traction. It's definitely possible to see a certain trajectory in the events of the day.  Then the two world wars happen, and all that change is put on hold for half a century.  Further constitutional change in Wales wasn't seen until the post of Minister for Welsh Affairs was created in 1951, and even then, the question didn't really become a political issue until the drowning of Cwm Tryweryn."
Wales,38l36t,xconde,5,Thu Jun 4 22:26:14 2015 UTC,"You don't need to consider so many networks, there's really only two or three real ones. o2/voda, EE, and three.  Giffgaff use o2. Virgin use EE (without 4G).  o2 and Vodafone now share their masts. If you check their 4G maps you'll find them identical.   EE was formed by the T-Mobile / Orange merge. Since then, the Orange masts are being brought into the T-mobile network to create EE.  3 and T-mobile shared 3G. So 3 has around 90% of the 3G that EE does, which will rise as the last few old Orange masts are brought into the T-mobile based EE network. They do not share 4G and 3 no longer have any access to 2G except in very rare cases.  EE have by far the most 4G in Wales, including silly places like the top of Snowdon. I'd suggest that there is already much more EE 4G in Wales than o2/Voda 3G.  Voda / o2 might have the best 2G but their 3G is miles behind EE / 3. Check the coverage map for any 3G away from the bigger towns, even places like Caernarfon are still 2G only. EE have 3G on pretty much every single mast.  If I had to recommend one, I'd say 'BT Mobile' as you get access to EE 4G coverage without paying their rediculous prices. All they offer though is 12 month sim only contracts so might not be suitable."

A 12 month contract with BT is indeed a bit long as I don't know how long I'll need it for. I'll check or EE and if it's indeed exorbitant the cost of the BT might be worth it.  Thanks again."

Wales,37gra1,yrhendystu,3,Tue Jun 2 20:49:28 2015 UTC,"Well it's a start. I'm glad that we're finally moving to reserved powers model, which will hopefully make it more simpler to understand the powers the assembly has compared to the UK parliament, and creates a assembly (or parliament as it will probably be called by then) which is far more freer to make its own laws without having to constantly consultant whether or not the law fits into a bunch of random pre-defined 'areas'.  But it's strange that Wales will remain within a combined jurisdiction with England still, even after Wales has gotten its own devolved government that can make its own laws - I'm not sure there's many places in the world that have that kind of setup. Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own jurisdictions, and in the US each state has its own as well I believe.

Wales,379cin,alun,2,Tue May 26 01:11:51 2015 UTC,"There are /some/ things in the east, but sadly useful roads don't make the list, so it's usually easier to drive on the English side of the border.  Hay-on-Wye / Y Gelli is an essential stop if you love books. It might be best to visit when they're isn's something on, as parking will be easier. http://www.hay-on-wye.co.uk/  Ludlow is about half-way up the border in the East. It is on the English side of the border, but it's connected to the history of Wales and still has a nice castle. http://www.castlewales.com/ludlow.html  The walking trails through my home town, Knighton / Trefyclawdd tend to be long-distance. The Offa's Dyke Trail runs the east side of Wales and K is the half-way point. There's a reasonable run of the dyke between Presteigne / Llanandras to the south of the town and a small museum at Knighton, http://www.offasdyke.demon.co.uk/odc.htm but I'd suggest this more if you were passing through than deliberately heading here.  There are some picturesque towns in the east. Montgomery / Trefaldwyn is far prettier than it needs to be, but there's not a lot there. It'd be worth a short stop if you're passing through, but again, given the main roads don't go there, if you are passing through you'll have taken a wrong turn.  There's Powis Castle by Welshpool  / Y Trallwng. That's a National Trust site. http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/powis-castle/ If you're planning on visiting a lot of National Trust sites, it might make sense to buy membership for a year at the first one, and you'll save money in parking fees and entrance. Otherwise it can get expensive.  Old Oswestry (English side of the border again) is an Iron Age hillfort you can walk over and get some nice views. That's likely to change due to urban development. http://oldoswestryhillfort.co.uk/  Up towards Wrexham there's Llangollen, http://www.new.llangollen.org.uk/ which is definitely worth a stop. It sits on the river Dee in a very pretty way and there's a few other sites around it. Get a good view and you can see why the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct is a UNESCO site. http://www.pontcysyllte-aqueduct.co.uk/ There's also the Valle Crucis Abbey by there http://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/vallecrucisabbey/?lang=en  I'll cheerfully agree the Gower is a must-see and the Pembrokeshire coast is amazing. I also like the Llŷn /Lleyn peninsula in the north. http://www.ahne-llyn-aonb.org/ but I think if you just take the A49/A5 to get up the east you could be missing one or two places."
Wales,379cin,KaiserMacCleg,2,Tue May 26 11:14:23 2015 UTC,"I've really gotta bust some myths here.  1) It's not worth doing a loop.  Categorically wrong. There's loads to do no matter where you are - east, west, north or south. If you're coming here with the express intent of driving around Wales, it would be a shame to miss out on most of the country on the back of some of the advice here.  2) The roads in eastern Wales are bad.  Not at all. I frequently drive from Wrexham to South Wales (so A483 - A470 most of the time) and the roads are no worse than the trunk roads through Shropshire and Herefordshire. The only hairy bit, IMO, is the Oswestry bypass - an extremely poorly designed road that should have been a dual carriageway. Very busy, with loads of overtaking (the road is wide enough to be three lanes, so lots of drivers take advantage of the chance to overtake - but that's also what makes it dangerous).  I wouldn't discourage taking the roads through Hereford and Shrewsbury either, though - it's a beautiful route with plenty of interest along its length. But then, so's the road through Newtown and Builth.  Oh, and north to south is four hours if you get a clear run. Three from Wrexham.  3) Snowdonia is all that's worth seeing in North Wales.  Nope.   Llandudno is the grandest, and probably the finest (possibly excepting Tenby) seaside resort in Wales. Its grand Victorian buildings and pier are shadowed by the bulk of the Great Orme, a headland which thrusts out into the Irish Sea, and which hides some of the largest Bronze Age mines in Europe. The views from the top are spectacular - you can even see the Isle of Man on a good day.  Llangollen is an absolutely charming town on the banks of the river Dee, which boasts, among other things:   The only remaining standard gauge steam railway in Wales One of the most spectacularly sited castles in Wales An excellent example of a medieval Abbey A UNESCO World Heritage Site.   The isle of Anglesey in the north-west is replete with things to see, from Iron Age burial mounds to stately homes to working mills to manmade moonscapes to the textbook concentric castle.  Elsewhere in North Wales, there are grand old houses, castles upon castles upon castles, great walks among the heather and hillforts of the Clwydian Range, and the most amazing Iron Age hillfort I've ever seen on a mountain on the Llyn Peninsula. Steer clear of Rhyl and I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Chester is just over the border too, and is definitely worth a visit."
Wales,379cin,lancerusso,2,Tue May 26 18:56:07 2015 UTC,"I'll repeat what tomOhorke said about no east side of Wales- not much interesting beyond Offa's Dyke there. North Wales has a plethora of wonderful castles built by our generous friends the English to suppress us (and a few natively built to keep them out). Conwy Castle is a spectacular example, with an adorable walled town, and nearby is Llandudno, the inspiration to Alice and Wonderland, which is a Victorian seaside resort with a huge limestone premonitory extending into the sea that has an ancient (2000BC) copper mine open for public visits on top of it. Conwy also contains a stunning example of a 16th century Manor house in the middle of town- Plas Mawr. The town also houses several good eateries and pubs/hotels/bed&breakfasts so is well worth staying there for one evening, I'd say.   Castle-wise, the best are Caerphilly, Caernarfon, Harlech and Conwy in my opinion. Beaumaris is also pretty good.  Also, with regards to cities, you will find only six. At least half of these are cities due to being hosts to ancient diocesan cathedrals for hundreds of years (almost a thousand iirc).St Asaph and Bangor, in the North (the only northern cities) and the Southern St Davids are such places. St Asaph and St Davids are the two least populated cities in the UK, and both have magnificent cathedrals, though I recommend the latter as a priority.   And if you happen to pass a rural stone built church on your travels, chances are it's in a place called 'Llan-something', as this is the traditional Welsh naming scheme; Llan is a way of saying 'parish of the church of Saint-something'. Countless minor saints founded these churches and many have seen settlement there since the dark ages, and there's a good chance that a church you visit holds the hidden remains (or often their empty caskets) of some forgotten prince or claimant killed trying to rebel. Many of these bodies were dug up and removed to stop people making them into martyrs by building shrines. A good example is Llywelyn the Great's stone coffin, which now resides in Llanrwst, down the conwy valley, who was initally buried in Aberconwy, and his body has been lost to time.  Edit: well, I had a good old ramble there. Hope some of it was useful!"

Wales,374sq8,SirBlah,3,Sun May 24 21:58:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit worried that the Central Station redevelopment is only going to make the concourse area bigger (which isn't a bad thing) and won't be touching any of the station platforms, which are horribly windswept and exposed.  Compare to other major stations like Paddington or St Pancreas which both have a giant canopy covering the platforms, and as well making the station less exposed to the elements also makes them look far more grand and stately, they make an impression. Cardiff Central feels like some small regional hub in comparison.  Looking at the renders they released a while back (and annoyingly they only released about 3 of them) it seams like that great big canopy they're building isn't actually going to cover the tracks for whatever reason. I hope I'm wrong because that would be a massive shame, that thing should enclose the entire station from north to south.  Edit: I'm also a little worried they might mess up the lovely art deco interior inside the original station building, it is listed and they did mention that the development won't effect it, but it's difficult to trust the people in charge of the railways sometimes, especially when they (or the people before them) did so much damage to historic station buildings in the name of cost savings, like the old Queen Street station in the 1970s (which used to have it's own canopy as well)"

Wales,3622i5,Charredcheese,14,Sat May 16 10:10:15 2015 UTC,"The terminology used is typical of this viewpoint and belies a certain prejudice.   We ""force"" kids to learn Welsh, apparently, and yet it is never said that we ""force"" kids to learn about English, Maths or Science - even when the methods used to encourage kids to learn are identical across subject areas.  Ultimately, Belfield's key argument has no grounding in reality. Examination statistics are published yearly by the Welsh Government and are available here:  http://gov.wales/statistics-and-research/examination-results/?lang=en  Below are the results for 2013/14, split according to medium. The figures given are percentages of all students (Welsh and English medium) who reach certain indicators of performance. For example, the Level 1 threshold is five GCSE passes of any grade. Level 2 is five good GCSE passes - grades A* - C. The Average Wider Points Score is an overall measure that considers all qualifications.     Foo Welsh Medium English medium    Level 1 Threshold 98% 96%   Level 2 Threshold 89% 83%   Level 2 (incl. English/Welsh & Maths) 63% 55%   Core Subject Indicator 61% 53%   Average Wider Points Score 592 528   Average Wider Points Score (capped at 8 subjects) 364 345    As you can see, Welsh medium wins on absolutely every indicator, so if anything, Welsh medium schools are dragging up the performance of the Welsh education system rather than bringing it down.  That is, however, an unfair comparison: on average, less kids in Welsh medium schools are on free school meals. Even when comparing like with like, however, Welsh medium schools tend to edge out their English medium counterparts. A full breakdown of examination results in schools by FSM entitlement and medium is available in this Excel file (third tab).  Only in the very richest schools - those where 10% or less of the students are on free school meals - does English medium win. No doubt because of private schools like Ruthin School.

The pool of talent simply isn't large enough to have a good Welsh language teacher in each and every English school, which is why I think we'd be better off targeting our efforts.   That's a different matter to Welsh medium, though.  Belfield claims that Welsh medium harms the educational prospects of kids - a point of view that is patently absurd and which is not borne out by the evidence.

Sitting kids down to effectively waste their time is no good to anyone and essentially undemocratic.  Otherwise I'd have to agree with you.

I am not saying that bilingualism is bad. It is extremely useful. But when the one of the languages that you learn is used in one major country in the world and is roughly spoken by 19% of that country's population, it's hard to say that that language is a useful skill to have.

He was attacking Welsh-medium and bilingual education, he was not attacking the Welsh Second Language course which you decided to rant about."
Wales,3622i5,ap_Cunedda,5,Fri May 15 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"Firstly, learning german or french at school is going to have little to no effect on later life. The quality of teaching foreign languages in the UK is shocking because a) we give very little respect to it and b) there is no opportunity to practice it in a natural environment, or learn it from native speakers. Learning up to GCSE french makes you less prepared to speak in france than learning GCSE maths would to make you an engineer.  Secondly, you won't run out of space by learning 1 language before another... if anything it will be easier, especially given that Welsh has gendered nouns, reverse noun and verb construction order common in many languages. As well as a shared heritage with any Gaelic influenced language. If anyone can handily learn their way around the way treiglads and contractions work in welsh, they can learn any language. Learning Welsh and English at school and then later needing to be able to speak German is no ones fault but your own if then didn't learn German.  Thirdly: You drastically under-appreciate the welsh language, which is not uncommon but it is uncalled for. It is one of the most fantastically rich and varied languages. It's linguistic influences range from Nordic, Gaelic, Breizh, Arabic and Hebrew. It's construction is so beautiful and poetic, even the most mundane of things like the circumflex ( ^ ) is wonderful in welsh - to bach - a little roof. When you describe the rain or snow, you don't say fall, you say bwrw because the rain in wales beats down. Chips!! Chips is sglodion, how can you not want to learn a language that has sglodion!... Faint o'r gloch? - That's not what is the time, that is how many of the bell. You don't 'go for a walk'... you mynd am dro - you go for a turn, because if you have to turn and come back.

Wales,3622i5,Huwbacca,2,Fri May 15 22:09:39 2015 UTC,"In my school, at least, we were given the opportunity, in all language based subjects, to visit the country(s) or vice versa have the native speakers visit us. Moreover, I know that many of those who studied German, French or any other language are now fluent, and not least because of their teaching in school.  For me it was not 'space' to learn languages that was the issue, but rather the time to do so; I had only the time to learn one language in addition to the usual science et cetera, and had no choice in which. So in part I do blame the school system for forcing me to learn Welsh, rather than another language.  It's not that I don't think Welsh should be there as an option, but rather it should remain at that and not be 'forced' on students.   Finally, I do agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment of the article - ""Tradition and heritage are important - but much more important is to ensure that we do not reduce the opportunities available for Welsh children"". This really resonates with me, I fear that by teaching welsh (often in the place of another language) we are isolating welsh children in an increasingly globe environment. My view is simple: Languages open doors, there are more doors available for languages such as Mandarin, German or French, than there are for Welsh."
Wales,3622i5,callumdg,4,Sat May 16 09:34:51 2015 UTC,"It must be very dependent on schools then. I went to school in what is probably, the closest UK school to France so we had quite regular exposure to the language. I had full secondary education in French, German and Latin up to GCSE yet the knowledge I have retained in those is fairly slim. My german runs out around ""Meine hamster in meine schlaftsack ist gestorben"" and how to order a beer. I will say that I really do value my latin education and wish I made more of that, but this is because I'm a bit of an etymology nerd..  I think the most important thing is that children, from 4 or 5, start making tracks towards bilingualism, irrelevant of the language chosen, and that sets you up incredibly well for learning languages later in life.  You might have heard about 'critical periods' when it comes to learning and language acquisition? (Apologies if you know this stuff, I'm approaching as if you don't!) But between 4-12 or so, the brain has a window were learning is especially effective compared to later life. Once you enter your teens, your brain starts this process of neuronal pruning which is where unused neuronal connections effectively die off because because they're not being used. In terms of intellect, this has no real impact, but in terms of auditory perception (my research field) it has quite the impact. You know how sometimes you might have someone from a foreign country teach you a word, and the sounds you produce are identical to theirs... yet they keep saying it's wrong? This is likely a result of pruning, the connections that would have allowed you to perceive those differences are no longer present. Neural plasticity is amazing  and it is likely possible to rebuild those connections, but it takes a lot longer.  Now if from a young age, the quantity of phonemes you learn during this critical period is a lot larger than just one language, then not only do you have twice the pool of vocabulary that might relate to this new language, but you have a greater range of phonemes that you can produce and perceive. I'm really lucky that I got to experience learning german, and later Dutch, in terms of my current welsh learning because phonemes like Ll, Ng (as in  ngastell Nedd) and ch are basically non-existent in English, French or Latin (I still struggle hugely with Ll).  I'm not saying what you said is wrong! This is just why I believe that no one language is better than the other to learn when at school!"
Wales,3622i5,Huwbacca,2,Sat May 16 11:07:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of that except the place name etymology. London is Llundain, and none of these names come from welsh. Strathclyde comes from Ystrad Clud, old welsh for 'straits of Clud' (that's where straits comes from iirc), that's a good example of derived placenames.  The most important thing here, I think is that if you're capable of learning Welsh non-natively, you are entirely capable of going and learning another language. The arguement that you didn't get to learn a 'more useful' language is not strong; you learnt a language, and it's eminently useful in welsh communities. It's laying the foundation for people to be able to work in those welsh communities which lacks certain skills, like bilingual science teaching."
Wales,3622i5,lancerusso,2,Sat May 16 09:39:11 2015 UTC,"llundain now yes, but I was led to believe it was stemmed from Llyn - lake, and Din - fort. And that was romanized into londinium which was 'celticised' back into llundain. To the best of my knowledge the examples I gave are all meant to be derived from the Welsh. I will happily hold my hands up if I'm wrong though!  Absolutely agree with your second part. The perceived usefulness of a language is a bit daft. I could quantify the number of people in the world speaking chinese and define that as more useful to learn based on that... But I'll never be in a professional situation where speaking chinese would be a benefit to me. I'd say that until you require a second language for a specific reason, they're all equally as useful to learn at school. I did latin, german, and french at school.... Latin was kind of useful for figuring out how to pronounce names of hospital departments, otherwise all 'useless' beyond the process of learning a language."
Wales,3622i5,Huwbacca,2,Sat May 16 10:48:37 2015 UTC,"Din is from Dinas, or Citadel, yes; caer is fort if you remember; You're probably right actually, I went looking- I thought it had a latin origin entirely from londinium, or something."
Wales,3622i5,lancerusso,1 point,Sat May 16 11:03:07 2015 UTC,"The interesting problem (or attraction) with etymology is that it is almost entirely ad-hoc explanations. We can only say ""This and this are similar so surely they are linked!"" though it can just be coincidence! It could well be that Llundain is just similar to Llyn din and it's a false relationship."

Learning similar languages like english/french/german is easy, if you have the skill. You either do or you don't, otherwise it's too much hard work. Being bilingual from an early age has been shown to contribute to language learning skills, too.  Consider, where would you be now (any different?) if you had learnt italian, or mandarin to the same degree? [ignore the fact that the latter is much harder due to logographic characters]"
Wales,3622i5,lancerusso,1 point,Sat May 16 09:42:28 2015 UTC,"I must admit my language learning skills are minimal. However I base my reasoning on where friends who speak said 'modern foreign language' are today, more than a handful are working (or at least have had the opportunity to) in other countries, and many are undisputedly in a higher earning/more satisfying job than that would have been had they stayed in Wales/UK."
Wales,3622i5,callumdg,-2,Sat May 16 09:47:59 2015 UTC,"Alive and kicking in a couple of bits of Wales, an economic backwater where 60% of the employed just work for the government."
Wales,3622i5,Ryuaiin,3,Sat May 16 12:56:09 2015 UTC,"I think you'll find the public employment rates for wales are at 26%, and are higher in northern ireland. Wales has the lowest percentage of public sector employees employed in central government of all the UK nations, and the highest percentage of public sector employees working in local government. This is symptomatic to a local council system that has to cover a very low population density with regards to public services, and a large amount of people in public employment for land regulation, forestry and agricultural commission. Public employment also covers the NHS and state schools (IE, most schools).  Furthermore, the rural, welsh speaking 'economic backwaters' of which you speak are precisely the ones with less than average public employment. Powys, Gwynedd, Conwy are such places, and the ones with above average public sector employment are the urban centres in the south: Cardiff, Bridgend, Swansea. It'd be nice if people looked up statistics. You can just as much find a company in wales that needs welsh speakers as you can ones that need 'foreign' language speakers. On the world's stage, it's not much, but you need a much more competent level of teaching and education than to a GCSE level french or other language for it to contribute to your employment capabilities- such as a degree level or A level skill."

Wales,3622i5,Ryuaiin,1 point,Sat May 16 15:16:11 2015 UTC,"Hahaha no worries. One of Wales' economic problems are the 'slums' of the north east. The cheaper land so close to liverpool has filled it with the population overflow from liverpool over the past century. This has diluted the local Welsh population- but that's no problem. The problem is that Wales gets less of a portion of public spending than it should do due to the unfair barnett formula, and as a result resources are spread thin towards improving living conditions for such people. IIRC this is one of the main contributors to Wales being one of the poorest areas in the whole of the EU"

Wales,35ygsb,cwtjon,2,Fri May 15 11:40:56 2015 UTC,"Public transport is a mixed bag - if you want to get from Aber to anywhere along one of the main roads or railway, it's not too bad, but if you want to get to/from the villages, it can be a struggle.  For houses, anywhere in town is quite expensive to buy due to the market for student rentals, but a few miles out, it gets significantly cheaper. If you want to live out of town, but with easy bus/train access, your best options would be Borth, Bow Street, Capel Bangor, Llanfarian They're all about ten mins drive away, although driving in to Aber during morning rush hour is usually a tedious experience. The train now runs every hour (used to be every two hours), so commuting by train is a lot better. Places on the train line are Borth, Eglwys Fach (about a mile walk to the station, though) and Machynlleth. The train ride between Aber and Machynlleth is glorious in the summer.

Wales,35ygsb,cwtjon,1 point,Fri May 15 10:58:24 2015 UTC,"It depends if you're going to live in town or out. If you both live and work in town, you can get by without a car very easily.   If you move out to a village on the bus routes, you can manage without a car OK, although it can be a drag if you want to do anything other than commuting (shopping, going out in the evening etc).  If you were to live in a village off the main routes, you could in theory manage without a car, but it'd be pretty masochistic.  Another option is do a CBT course (CBT being Compulsary Basic Training in this context - it's a day long course for about £110, and qualifies you to ride a motorcycle up to 125cc) and get a cheap little motorbike. I did this when I was living in Aber and working in Machynlleth, and it worked out cheaper than commuting on the bus or train.  Ferry-wise, there's ferries over to Ireland from Holyhead (2.5hrs north) or Fishguard (similar distance south)"

Wales,351sdu,DanJonMor,1 point,Thu May 7 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for other contituencies but Merthyr and Rhondda looks to be a two horse race for the first time in ages (maybe ever) between Labour and UKIP. It's been a Labour stronghold for donkey years but UKIP have set up a campaign shop in Merthyr town centre and announced their Welsh Manifesto in the old town hall. A lot of people in my generation (18-25) are voting UKIP (me not being one of them) and something tells me UKIP might swing it from Labou., I pray it doesn't given some of the things they've said in the past that pertain to me and others in my position but it's going to be interesting come tomorrow night"
Wales,351sdu,Elljp33,4,Wed May 6 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"Can't see UKIP winning in Merthyr. Bookmakers give Labour's chance at reelection here at 1/50. Haven't heard many people who are open about voting ukip, the lib dems seemed to have more support last election here than UKIP do now. Nonetheless, here's to hoping they don't get in."
Wales,351sdu,KaiserMacCleg,3,Wed May 6 17:43:18 2015 UTC,"UKIP won't take Merthyr. They may come a distant second, but there aren't going to be many safer seats on election day. The Lib Dems were Labour's main competition in Merthyr, and given the Lib Dem collapse and the increase in the Labour vote nationally, I expect a modest increase in Labour's vote share, albeit with some voters switching to UKIP.  I expect a very different scenario in Rhondda. Another easy Labour hold, to be sure, but I expect Plaid to make serious ground. Leanne Wood lives in the constituency, and has pushed that connection in the TV debates. A strong potential base of support exists for Plaid in the constituency - as evidenced in previous Assembly elections - and the opinion polls suggest fertile ground for growing the vote. The crossbreaks in this poll show a 9.5% increase in Plaid's vote in South Wales Central - an increase that I would expect is largely concentrated in Rhondda and the Cynon Valley. Election Forecast even has Plaid on 31% - though I'm not sure the increase in their vote share will be that emphatic. UKIP won't get anywhere much.   Another interesting Valleys seat is Neath. I wonder how many voters will abandon Labour there given Peter Hain's retirement."
Wales,351sdu,KaiserMacCleg,1 point,Wed May 6 17:45:55 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, just checked Llanelli on that Election Forecast and it's a tie with Labour and Plaid on 36%! I heard there was a bit of momentum from them there but wasn't expecting this."
Wales,351sdu,theemperorsfist,2,Wed May 6 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't take the seat-specific numbers on Election Forecast too literally. They do say this, after all:  ""When reading our seat predictions, please keep in mind that our model may not know as much about your specific seat of interest as you do. The model knows how the general patterns of support across the UK have changed in constituencies with different kinds of political, geographic and demographic characteristics. The model uses the Ashcroft constituency polls where available, plus smaller samples of polling data for every constituency, extracted from pooling many national-level polls. However, the model does not know whether your MP is beloved by constituents or embroiled in scandal, nor does it know whether Boris Johnson or Nigel Farage is standing in your constituency, let alone what the implications of that might be. Some of this might be picked up in the polls, but not all of it will be, and we do not have much polling data to go on when it comes to constituencies.""  Wales-wide, though, they are predicting a significantly higher vote share for Plaid: 18% versus 13% in the two most recent full-scale polls. That'll be the real test for Election Forecast in Wales - if they're right and the polls are wrong, that would be quite a coup."
Wales,34x6xf,Drowz0r,2,Tue May 5 08:39:14 2015 UTC,"Good luck, but I couldn't vote for a party that had this as a core policy:   Copyright should give artists and innovators the chance to make money from their work; however, that needs to be balanced with the rights of society as a whole. We will work for copyright reform and reduce copyright terms to 10 years to balance everyone's needs.   How would that balance everyone's needs? Which needs and rights of society should dictate that after 10 years I lose the rights to artistic works I have created? Most artists, writers, musicians etc are not high earners and rely on residual income that builds over time (sometimes after generations of modest living). They're not all Cliff Richard or Paul McCartney.   We will support preserving digital culture and introduce IP exceptions to allow the archiving of digital culture.   Could you provide any more information on this idea? What would the IP exceptions be and how might the preservation work?"

We can still have intellectual property respected and the original creator can still make money from it without it being as massively restricted as it is now.  There are some really fine creative commons licenses for example. You know this website? It's probably sitting on a Linux server with CC licenses or some similar licenses on it. If someone copyrighted that stuff and it was enforced - things like reddit wouldn't exist.  Also the music industry isn't suffering because copyright isn't tight enough - it's suffering because it's just too damn tight! For every 19 pounds a regular copyright respecting user spends, a pirate, someone who doesn't really respect copyright, spends 26 pounds. Pirates are showing us in real time that copyright being broken is exactly what the digital economy needs.  If you're worried about the artist themselves, the music industry is the most exploitive industry on the plant and movie producers are turning over constant record profits. The artists never get their due and it's not because of pirates or anti-copyright campaigners, it's because these huge companies horde copyright and choke out the artist from sharing, often, their own work.

Wales,34x6xf,MeiLewis,2,Tue May 5 16:48:05 2015 UTC,Some good points there but using Linux as an example is invalid - it exists perfectly happily under current copyright law.
Wales,34x6xf,beatlesbible,1 point,Tue May 5 18:25:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 and not copyright [restrictions]... thankfully. Or did you mean something else?  Edit: Pointed out to me that this was a bit unclear.  I mean of course, Linux exists under copyright law fine because Linus Torvalds didn't choose to restrict it under copyright law, he went to CC licenses. Sadly when rights are sold or horded, this doesn't happen.  In short it exists perfectly happy under copyright law purely because Linus Torvald released it under CC."
Wales,34x6xf,MeiLewis,2,Tue May 5 18:52:01 2015 UTC,"Copyright isn't the only license - it's just the only one that people tend to think of, at least at first.   Your party's policy only mentions copyright, and fails to outline a workable alternative. Shouldn't that be addressed before you talk about automatic removal of the rights to artistic ownership?   We can still have intellectual property respected and the original creator can still make money from it without it being as massively restricted as it is now.   By that logic, why have a 10-year limit for copyright at all? Why not axe it and force everyone to adopt a CC licence instead?   Also the music industry isn't suffering because copyright isn't tight enough - it's suffering because it's just too damn tight! For every 19 pounds a regular copyright respecting user spends, a pirate, someone who doesn't really respect copyright, spends 26 pounds. Pirates are showing us in real time that copyright being broken is exactly what the digital economy needs.   You do know that correlation does not imply causation, right? Large consumers of content may well be likely to pirate material before spending money on it. They try before they buy. I don't have a problem with that. Those people are already in the business of paying for content. It doesn't necessarily follow that everyone would do the same if copyright terms were reduced or abandoned. We simply don't know if revenues would inevitably rise. Personally I doubt it. In countries where piracy is particularly rife I'm not sure that the citizens are climbing over each other to pay for creative content.   If you're worried about the artist themselves, the music industry is the most exploitive industry on the plant and movie producers are turning over constant record profits. The artists never get their due and it's not because of pirates or anti-copyright campaigners, it's because these huge companies horde copyright and choke out the artist from sharing, often, their own work.   The music and film industry models may well be broken, but that doesn't mean copyright has failed. The problems you mention are more to do with exploitative contracts and avaricious companies, and are not relevant to the hordes of self-published authors or self-releasing musicians who are bypassing the traditional model, or to those whose artistic creations may become commercially viable after your arbitrary 10-year timeframe.  By taking away the ownership of a creation you're not just hurting the big studios and labels that you might dislike - you're also hurting independent artists, labels, studios, authors, publishers, writers etc, and we'll be culturally poorer if their output declines or stops because they can no longer make money from it. But hey, take the food off their tables. I'm sure it's for the wider good of society.   We also find when trust is placed in the public, through companies like Humble Bundle who release games DRM-Free for $0.01 (so less than one penny) users, especially on the Linux community, pay up to three times the RRP.   That's fine, that's what Humble Bundle wants to do, and it works within a relatively small subculture. But I maintain it should be up to content creators to determine how their products are sold, not some political party that wishes to enforce its preferred model on everyone. But I guess I'm less authoritarian than you. How ironic.   Generally the only companies that do suffer are the ones like EA that do absolutely no fan service and release what are essentially faulty games (riddled with bugs... and a game you can't get a refund on).   Well there's a straw man argument. Just because a company operates with a crap business model, it doesn't follow that IP and copyright is broken. If a business isn't working it's up to them to address it, not the state. EA is irrelevant to a great many gamers anyway.   Fun Fact: You're not actually allowed to sing happy birthday without infringing on copyright law   And I don't agree with that. The song was first published in 1893. I believe that copyright should end with the death of the creator(s). While that person is alive they should be free to exploit their creations as they see fit.  Look, I get what you're trying to do. I've read the arguments here and elsewhere, and I know I'm unlikely to change your mind. I also know that piracy will never be stamped out. But please don't try to pretend that imposing a certain content model is for the greater good of society. Just because people like having free stuff doesn't necessarily mean it should be free."

Honestly I think in terms of digital rights a large part of the UK is behind you (and if Snowden taught us anything it's that the UK is in a really bad place in terms of citizen surveillance) they just don't respect you as a political entity yet as the name suggests you're very one dimensional.

Wales,34x6xf,TrumanZi,1 point,Tue May 5 15:26:49 2015 UTC,"Loz Kaye, Leader of Pirate Party UK did a little video about it here. It's not even five mins long and sums it up perfectly:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1Ae5rgUG9U  For those of you who can't watch that right now:  Crowd sourcing policies sounds something a bit risky and complicated but it's actually, probably, the simplest and easiest ways to build a manifesto. I've seen the classic Labour method, I've seen the Greens method... and now Pirates and it's just infinitely better.  However that is merely a by-product of why we do it. We do it because regardless of having a simple, modest, one-liner idea or an entire full blown report, you can submit your idea for a policy. I've done a few myself actually!  Once submitted, the policy is discussed, both encouraged and critically evaluated. Everyone gets a chance to submit evidence for or against the policy, if they want to.  Once the policy discussions are over, it's put to the policy team to write it up into a formal and neutral policy. By neutral I mean it doesn't sound left wing, right wing or the wording isn't trying to convince/discourage the reader.  The last step is for the membership to vote for or against the policy.  You can even make a suggestion to have an existing policy removed, if you think times have changed and something needs updating.  It's a true Pirate way of doing things - Pirates try before they buy. So you can be hugely involved without even being a fully fledged member. This way people can see we listen way before them having to officially join the party.   We then find that naturally, when people are heard they join up.  We use our website forum and reddit primarily but many other sources are used too. Then naturally we advertise it through the usual social media outlets.  We recently finished a crowd source here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/policy2015  Another benefit is, you don't need nor should you have a few people trying to dream up all conceivable policies a party needs. You get a much more direct democratic process and it's a much more manageable workload for the policy team.  It makes a policy that isn't me or even us - it's a policy that is you."

Wales,34x6xf,Oh_jeffery,1 point,Tue May 5 11:30:35 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow ""Bridgedion""!  It felt wrong to wait until 7pm to answer this, seeing as you're right here in Bridgend anyway!  My name is David, I'm on the Broadlands where I built my home back in the early 2000s back when it was mostly fields. I understand people in Bridgend are often stuck between getting a commuting job in Swansea or a commuting job in Cardiff (I've had both) and our party has a lot of solutions to that - such as encouraging remote working to solve both our population and congestion issues in cities as well as providing a healthier lifestyle for employees. Of course this means our broadband infrastructure needs to really catch up with Europe.  Here are some specific Bridgend-Policies as well as some pledges that set me apart from the other Candidates here:  https://wales.pirateparty.org.uk/spokesperson-for-wales/bridgend/  If the above link is a bit tl;dr for you, then in a nut shell:  No fracking  Better Recycling (to reduce littler and collections)  No Dog Fowling - especially on the school run areas  Porthcawl seafront regeneration  More Schools - bigger schools, smaller class sizes  Better road infrastructure (we've had something like a 50% population boom in 10 years or something rediculous but the roads and rail have barely been touched)  Mobile signal dead zones eliminated  Highest crime in Bridgend is anti-social behaviour - so better community cohesion is needed (though we are a bit lucky there - as in my last town in Barry, store crime was a big one and in St Athan, it's car crime, which is where I also frequently visit).  We need to appreciate the benefits in Bridgend but not let them slide away due to neglect."
Wales,34x6xf,CheShA,3,Tue May 5 11:55:59 2015 UTC,"As someone who lives in Newport, but used to commute to Bridgend for work 4 days a week.  There is an above average amount of office work in Bridgend (Drastically more than Newport anyway), especially as companies now get grants for moving large offices there. However, the amount of work in Bridgend is dwarfed by that of Cardiff/Swansea.  Encouraging Remote working + improving your infrastructure are fantastic goals for your party, and could potentially bring even more work to Bridgend. I wish you the best of luck."
Wales,34x6xf,Caerau,2,Tue May 5 14:03:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Gosh, I'd hate to see your petrol bill... alternatively I feel for you if you brave the train, our infrastructure is really out of date!  Yes I completely agree there are quite a few (one in-particular) large, international corporations that are in Bridgend.  Often these companies are open to remote working as they understand it saves office space and reduces a sickness record.  It would also cut down on flexible working agreements being necessary as the remote employee can balance home-work life easier. Alternatively flexible working agreements need not be so difficult to agree as no time is lost in commuting :)"
Wales,34x6xf,Caerau,3,Tue May 5 14:12:51 2015 UTC,How can you make the broadband better in Bridgend? That would obviously facilitate more people working from home but I doubt I could do it with how much it cuts out for me. Is having the majority work from home the future for Bridgend? It's sad to see the amount of shops shutting down here in recent years. Is there no way of bucking that trend?
Wales,34x6xf,CheShA,2,Tue May 5 14:14:28 2015 UTC,"What really grinds my gears about Bridgend is that a lot of the housing here isn't even that old. We of course have some period housing but there was a housing boom in Brackla some decades ago and since 1998 to this very day we've been investing almost exclusively, massively into Broadlands for housing.  Why on earth they didn't lay proper cable infrastructure I don't know... and still aren't laying new internet cables! A lot of streets are still stuck on old copper wire while in Europe fibre optic is old news. Even then the exchanges are too far away or ISPs cannot deliver a stable connection.  It's absolutely baffling because when you go to rightmove.co.uk or most online agencies for houses, they factor broadband speed and availability into the listing now. Broadband is a selling point for houses... so builders REALLY need to catch up.  This is a beast that can be attacked from many angles.  1) Nationalise BT OpenReach to guarantee a basic Internet connection to all  2) Increase social housing so builders cannot monopolise the housing market, knowing people will take any property due to shortages - this means they will have to start considering things like which quality of cables to lay etc  3) Admit the Superfast Cymru scheme has failed because even where good connections were laid, the prices to use the faster connections are too high. We need to ensure the infrastructure increases while costs stay down - exactly like our European friends.  As an addition to a strong physical network; mobile phone deadzones being eliminated would also improve our internet coverage when roaming and we should also have public wifi spots where needed.  I completely agree with you about our shops here. The shops shutting down in the town centre was something I was always aware of but after the collapse of gamestation, blockbuster and now even clothes shops (something you don't typically go online for) missing from our streets makes it looks barren! There are some classic fixes for this which will help in the short term; reducing fees stores pay to set up (lease/business rates) and having free parking in towns so people are encourages to stop and shop... but ultimately we also need people's wages to increase to a standard where they can afford to shop. It also used to be the case where only one parent in a household would work and provide the money while the other would shop during the day - now we live in a society where both parents or both partners need to work because wages have been ground down so low - so our economic policies would help people to have to work less and having some actual free time to shop."

Wales,34v9n0,pearlsandwhiskey,11,Mon May 4 21:12:52 2015 UTC,"I applaud your bravery.  This is the correct pronunciation.  That said, you're not going to get very far without learning some basics first.   You may have noticed that double Ls in Welsh don't sound a thing like an English L. Ll is actually a separate letter in the Welsh alphabet - and there are five of them in Llanfair PG.   To say ""Ll"", start with an ""S"", and, while exhaling, move your tongue upward so that it comes into contact with the roof of your mouth. Air will now escape around the sides of your tongue, producing a hissing sound not all that dissimilar from an English ""Sh"". That's a Welsh ""Ll"".  Here's what it should sound like.  Another key sound is ""Ch"". Again, it sounds nothing like the English ""Ch"", and there are two of them in Llanfair PG. If you know how to pronounce Ch in German or a J in (European) Spanish, then you know the Welsh Ch. Otherwise, start with an English C. A Welsh Ch is articulated slightly further back in the throat than an English C, and involves constricting the airway, rather than closing it completely.  Here's what it should sound like.  All the other sounds should be familiar enough to an English speaker, though they might not appear when you expect given the differences in orthography. Here's how I'd break it down phonetically:   Llan - as in ""pan"", but with an Ll. vyre - as in ""pyre"", but with a V. pooll - short ""oo"", an in ""good"". Remember, that's an Ll, not an L. guin - all Welsh Gs are hard, as in ""gun"", not ""gin"". gill gog - fairly long O here, as in ""roar"" er - E as in ""pen"", not ""perm"" ich - Ch as above, not as in ""church"" uirn - both vowel sounds should be audible; don't revert to something like ""burn"".  drob - short O, as in ""orange"". ooll - short ""oo"" again - as in ""good"". llan - don't bother pronouncing the two separate ""Ll""s. tuss - as in ""Gus"". il io - short ""o"" again. go - and again. go - and again. goch - and again.   Technically your Rs should be tapped / rolled as well - as in Spanish."

This is actually quite an interesting poll, because like Ashcroft's constituency polls, it asked a supplementary question asking respondents to consider their voting intention taking into account the situation in their own constituencies. Therefore you could reasonably expect considerations like tactical voting and the popularity of incumbent MPs to be reflected in people's responses. Here are the results to that second question:   LAB: 37% CON: 25% PC: 15% UKIP: 12% LD: 7% GRN: 2%   Encouraging numbers for Plaid, therefore - if they manage to reach 15%, that would be their highest ever vote share in a general election. I'm sceptical that they will do that well on the day, but they've had a strong showing in this campaign, so perhaps it's not impossible."

Wales,33dk4c,JRD656,2,Wed Apr 22 06:15:02 2015 UTC,Scotland's GDP per capita was higher than England's for years before the price of oil collapsed and Scotland was actually a net contributor to the UK's finances before the price of oil collapsed.

In terms of constituency AMs, Plaid has 3 from the north and 2 from the south. In terms of list AMs, Plaid has 1 from the north and 4 from the south (and one from Mid and West Wales which straddles the country).   The party leader is from the deepest, darkest Rhondda, for god's sake."
Wales,33cwcx,KaiserMacCleg,3,Tue Apr 21 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"You seem to set great store by a false perception,  then.   Of course Rhondda is a safe Labour seat.  It's the definition of a safe Labour seat. That doesn't mean Plaid is nowhere there. Plaid have held the Assembly seat in the past and will no doubt mount a strong challenge in 2016, as Leanne Wood will be running for the constituency.    Labour is utterly dominant at Westminster,  and will be this year as well.  Plaid will likely be a distant second,  but second place is still second place. The South-east is not as unfamiliar with Plaid as you think.   ""Distant second"" is probably the best way to describe Plaid across the coalfield.  Realistically,  they don't stand much of a chance of winning any seats in the foreseeable future (Llanelli excepted),  but they remain something of an unofficial opposition to Labour's dominance.  In '99, they won two valleys seats -  Rhondda and Islwyn - and very nearly took others,  such as the Cynon Valley.    I don't understand your last comment.  If the issue is perceptions, as you seem to be saying, what is it that Plaid must reform? The party has been attempting to address this particular image problem for many years,  and that was most certainly a factor in the election of Leanne Wood as party leader.  Their policies are very much targeted at the archetypal disengaged Labour voter,  and their recent focus on the economy and austerity at the expense of the Welsh language is also,  quite clearly,  a deliberate choice. The party even picked up a bilingual name a few years ago.  Also not accidental. There is only so much you can do when faced with an almost non-existent Welsh media,  but there can be no doubt that the party is doing all it can to appeal to Labour voters in the south-east."

Wales,32p55f,Meliv23,5,Wed Apr 15 17:47:23 2015 UTC,"since when has it been a scenic rural valley?   A number of the suicides that were counted in the initial spate were from the Garw valley and Maesteg areas, both part of the wider Bridgend county.  Sorry to nitpick your post.   If this was a documentary into the supposed 'Werther Effect' or a look at how the oxygen of publicity can drive suicide rates up, I wouldn't feel so bad about them using Bridgend as an example. But it's pretty obvious this is a dramatisation that will feed off the idea that there was a cult of suicide in the area. That isn't just a lie, it's deplorable to the families of the dead."
Wales,32p55f,bllewe,2,Wed Apr 15 21:54:40 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I grew up near the town centre so I always remember it as such. The cult theory always makes me angry, the majority of the suicides were people who didn't even know each other. It was a media field day, if anything."
Wales,32p55f,Muridae,7,Wed Apr 15 23:50:47 2015 UTC,"Not only insensitive, it's hugely irresponsible.

Wales,32cbyb,gyda_dwp,11,Sun Apr 12 17:30:15 2015 UTC,"I would try and get out and about in Sept/Oct while the days are longer and the weather likely to be better. Some easy trips out by train from Cardiff are Penarth pier and Barry Island - both are seaside resorts that have undergone bit revamps in the last couple of years. Barry Island in particular has a lovely beach and nice walks.   Castell Coch ('red castle' in English) is a nice bike ride from Cardiff up the 'Taff Trail' cycle path. Cardiff has some wonderful parks - take a walk through Bute Park and Roath Park while you are here.  In town there are some good shops. As well as the big chains/department stores, you should check out the independent shops in the historic arcades. I love Spillers Records, supposedly the oldest record shop in the world. If you are feeling homesick, visit New York Deli for bagels and coffee.   Cardiff is famous for its nightlife. The city centre can get quite wild on weekends but you can have a quieter/more cultural time if you prefer, depends where you go. If you like beer, try the City Arms or Chapter Arts Centre's cafe/bar for a wide choice of local and guest beers.   In terms of restaurants, I often prefer ones outside the centre. Some to try: Bangkok Cafe, Ichiban and Chai Street in Canton. Vegetarian Food Studio in Grangetown. Canteen on Clifton Street in Splott. Milgi in Roath.   Take a trip down to Cardiff Bay by boat, bus or train - visit the Senedd (Welsh Assembly) - the do tours. Also the Millennium Centre and Norwegian Church. There is a big Dr Who exhibition and also location tours for that and Torchwood if you like those shows. If the weather is good, walk (or hire a bike) and go across the Cardiff Bay barrage and back. Great views across the channel to England.  I don't personally like sport, but if you do, try to go to a rugby game, especially the internationals if you can. You can take tours of the Millennium Stadium too, which could be fun.  My favourite museum is a short bus ride out of town - St Fagan's museum of Welsh life. Reconstructed buildings from around Wales - a good way to get a sense of Wales' history and culture. Well worth a visit."

Wales,32cbyb,KaiserMacCleg,3,Sun Apr 12 20:08:52 2015 UTC,"I'd also highly recommend Cardiff Castle. There's no better place to get a sense for the history of the city: the castle itself is a Norman construction located within the footprint of renovated Roman fort, with a spectacular Victorian mansion next door.  The interior of the mansion is the highlight, for me."

They've also been hosting quite a few meetings in some of the towns along the old line, which have been pretty successful."
Wales,328kuj,CaptainDjango,7,Sat Apr 11 16:50:12 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea and exactly what Wales needs, however:   Where is the money to do all this going to come from? Since they destroyed the railway last time and sold it all off then where could they actually feasibly put it? I don't think you could get a line from Carmarthen to Pencader without years of bureaucracy and farmers flipping their shit"
Wales,328kuj,I_miss_Chris_Hughton,6,Sat Apr 11 15:38:31 2015 UTC,"It would cost a fair bit, currently they're campaigning to get the Carmarthen to Aberstwyth part done since currently getting from South Wales to Aberstwyth by rail a pretty monstrous journey, more then 4 hours 30 minutes if you're lucky, plus having to change train halfway though.  Apparently only about 3% or so of the track as been built on, a bit of it has been turned into a cycle lane but most of it still survives, including most of the bridges and the tunnels. The big problem will be getting the line into Aber: that part has been built over and there's a big hill in the way, tunneling under it might be the only viable option.  The part from Carmarthen to Llanpumsaint would probably require redirecting the line to follow the A485 since the Gwili Railway owns that part of the track, and the campaign group is quite friendly to them. One advantage to that would be that the journey could be a lot quicker since the original line took a very meandering route following the Gwili river."
Wales,328kuj,bearjuani,3,Sat Apr 11 15:57:27 2015 UTC,COuld you not instead link the railway to borth or mac.? I mean then it becomes slightly easier to build the track and for people from north wales to go south by the sound of things
Wales,328kuj,bearjuani,5,Sat Apr 11 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the old mid wales line? I suppose that's also an option, although I believe that line has been built over far more, a lot of the A470 travels along the route. It also took a huge detour over to Caersws near Newtown, according to this map.   If you wanted to get to Aberstwyth to Cardiff then this route would probably be slower then the Carmarthen to Aberstwyth line + Swansea District Line + South Wales Mainline.  Of course in the end I personally wouldn't object to any railway line in Wales being rebuilt, Beeching completely butchered the Welsh rail system and it's time we started putting things right."

(The Ffestiniog line being the tracks on the right)  I believe part of the reason it was built like this due to the terrain being a bit too steep for a normal train, you can see the tracks are far more curvy then the standard gauge lines as it curves around the terrain.  ...Plus it means they wouldn't be able to use all those old 100 year old steam trains, there's an awful lot of heritage on that railway."

Historians call it Offa's Dyke so that schoolkids can get some cheap laughs Folk in Wales start calling themselves ""Cymry"" rather than ""Brythoniaid"" Age of the Saints Rhodri Mawr reks some Vikings Hywel Dda makes some laws Gryffydd ap Llywelyn unites the country before Harold Godwinson nobbles him Godwinson is also nobbled by William the Bastard; Normans take over England   NORMANS   Normans decide they'd like a bit of Wales too Normans almost conquer us Welsh fight back, taking back most of the country Normans build castles Welsh build castles Castles begin to reproduce by themselves, and turn on their human masters Age of the Princes Llywelyn ab Iorwerth & King John have a tussle; Magna Carta signed Llywelyn creates the Principality of Wales Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn II, loses the Principality of Wales English take over Fuck   ENGLISH   Repression & rebellion & more castles Black Death Owain Glyndwr comes along and brings with him a last gasp of Welsh independence He loses Shit Gentry start becoming anglicised Gradually the country recovers from ceaseless war   TUDORS   So it's time for more war. War of the Roses breaks out; gardeners everywhere turn on each other The war ends with one Welshman killing the King, and another Welshman stealing his throne. Henry of the Welsh Tudor dynasty becomes Henry VII, King of England. Names his kid Arthur, because destiny or some shit Arthur dies, because fuck you Henry VIII becomes king instead & abolishes the very notion of Wales William Morgan translates the Bible into Welsh and Lizzie I prints it en masse. She also uses Welsh legends (King Arthur & Prince Madog) to justify hegemony over Britain and North America   EARLY MODERN SHIT   Religious stuff happens, because people can now read the Bible and don't have to take the Pope's word. Puritanism! Fun! Wales stays on the wrong side during the Civil War despite producing the Cromwell family, gets rekt by the Lord Protector Olly Griffith Jones and his mobile schools turn Wales into one of the most literate countries in Europe A revival of interest in Welsh culture and history is lead by Iolo Morgannwg - poet, eccentric, historian, forger. Iolo recreates the Eisteddfodau of old - competitive celebrations of Welsh culture People leave for 'Murica, particularly Pennsylvania. William Penn briefly toys with calling the colony ""New Wales"" Methodism sweeps Wales along with the other nonconformists; Anglicanism swept into the dustbin of history west of Offa's Dyke Industrial revolution. In Wales that means coal, steel, copper, slate, tin and wool. Towns grow like never before, particularly in the coalfields. Rape of the Fair Country, rich capitalists, downtrodden masses etc. The first steam railway in the world in Merthyr Tydfil The first inklings of what would become socialism are developed in the South Wales valleys & the mind of Welshman Richard Price The docks expand: Cardiff becomes one of the largest ports in the world in terms of the amount of goods passing through Loads of immigration: the Welsh language begins to decline   MODERN SHIT   University of Wales, National Library & National Museum all founded Senghennydd disaster: coal mine blows up World War I: death, death & more death. Hedd Wyn, a Welsh poet whose bardic name means blessed peace, dies in the trenches before being posthumously awarded the chair at the National Eisteddfod Dai Lloyd George becomes the first and only Welsh Prime Minister of the UK; goes on to win World War Interwar period: the coalfields start to decline, Labour takes over as the dominant party in Wales from the Liberals Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, founded Gresford disaster: another coal mine blows up World War II; because one wasn't enough 1950s: Cardiff made capital 1960s: Welsh office created; Tynged yr Iaith; upswing in Welsh language activism; Prince Charles' investiture; bombings by Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru; Tryweryn; Aberfan disaster - coal tip falls on school 1970s: Wales says no to a Welsh Assembly, because we hate ourselves 1980s: Miner's strike, Maggie Thatcher, South Wales coalfield enters terminal decline 1990s: Wales says yes to a Welsh Assembly, because we said no last time and they gave us Maggie Thatcher. Welsh Language Act gives Cymraeg official status in Wales   I think that just about covers it."

Wales,32cgje,Barker700,6,Mon Apr 13 00:57:09 2015 UTC,That was actually really interesting.
Wales,32cgje,Barker700,4,Mon Apr 13 00:28:47 2015 UTC,"Welsh history is interesting!  There's an awful lot of fascinating stories that I did not touch upon, too - there's Caractacus (Caradog), who lead the resistance against the Romans after the initial invasion. After his final defeat, he was carried back to Rome with the spoils of war to be displayed and then executed in Claudius' Triumph. First, however, he was allowed to address the Senate directly, and the speech that he made so impressed them that they forestalled his execution, and he was allowed to live out the rest of his days with his family within the walls of the city:  ""If the degree of my nobility and fortune had been matched by moderation in success, I would have come to this City as a friend rather than a captive, nor would you have disdained to receive with a treaty of peace one sprung from brilliant ancestors and commanding a great many nations. But my present lot, disfiguring as it is for me, is magnificent for you. I had horses, men, arms, and wealth: what wonder if I was unwilling to lose them? If you wish to command everyone, does it really follow that everyone should accept your slavery? If I were now being handed over as one who had surrendered immediately, neither my fortune nor your glory would have achieved brilliance. It is also true that in my case any reprisal will be followed by oblivion. On the other hand, if you preserve me safe and sound, I shall be an eternal example of your clemency.""  And then of course there are the Rebecca Riots, and the Chartist movement, whose cause ended so tragically. Wales produced a great many thinkers during the last few centuries too: men like Bertrand Russell (atheists will know him from Russell's Teapot), Alfred Russell Wallance (co-discoverer of evolution) and Richard Price (a democrat and a socialist before those words were even in use)."
Wales,32cgje,skeptichectic,7,Mon Apr 13 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"Britain! The Welsh haven't migrated a great amount, with the exception of a colony in Argentina which still speaks Welsh to this day. This is a very simplified and brief version of events but after the Romans invaded and left, England in particular was open to a lot of attacks from Saxons and Vikings so a lot of the native people of Britain, the Celts, moved north or west in an attempt to get further away from the more vulnerable coastlines into places we today call Cornwall, Wales and Scotland."
Wales,32cgje,JRD656,3,Sun Apr 12 20:46:03 2015 UTC,I hope he bought you dinner first?!
Wales,32cgje,Barker700,5,Mon Apr 13 06:41:09 2015 UTC,Your name is Dylan. You should of known sooner. Fire away question wise
Wales,32cgje,colonelcardiffi,-14,Sun Apr 12 17:25:20 2015 UTC,Dylan is a Welsh name?
Wales,32cgje,lukeowain,6,Sun Apr 12 17:34:26 2015 UTC,Yeah its a pretty welsh name.
Wales,32cgje,remlap,-12,Sun Apr 12 17:36:02 2015 UTC,What about Robert and Davies?
Wales,32cgje,remlap,8,Sun Apr 12 17:37:41 2015 UTC,Davies is a massively Welsh surname. At least in southern wales.
Wales,32cgje,remlap,-18,Sun Apr 12 18:26:19 2015 UTC,Southern Wales. Is there a difference between them and the rest of the country? Do they look any different?
Wales,32cgje,JRD656,15,Sun Apr 12 19:09:09 2015 UTC,Are you fucking retarded?
Wales,32cgje,yrhendystu,6,Mon Apr 13 02:22:42 2015 UTC,"Haha, we're a very small country, but South Wales is where most of the population and industry is. They don't look different though. one thing that is very different in all parts of Wales is the accent and number of Welsh speakers!"
Wales,32cgje,terrynutkinsfinger,-10,Sun Apr 12 19:35:54 2015 UTC,Welsh is an awesome language! Too bad I don't know it :(
Wales,32cgje,KaiserMacCleg,13,Sun Apr 12 19:45:54 2015 UTC,"How kind of you to say so! Knowing a few phrases always comes in handy when trying to convince people you really are of Welsh descent :D The best thing to do would be to visit Wales, see the coastline that beat California to No.1 position for best beaches; enter into a hollow mountain filled with trampolines and ziplines followed by a jawdropping look around magnificent castles, towering mountains, and winding rivers! Top that off by drinking your fill of Welsh cider, mead, beer and even wine while downing a bowl of Cawl, Welsh rarebit, Welsh cakes and bara brith! Don't forget that we're also the country of King Arthur and Merlin, with the oldest language in Europe. Plus we have the best flag in the world :P  I may have over done myself here... but you should be proud to be descended from Cymry, Cymru am byth! xD"
Wales,32cgje,KaiserMacCleg,-11,Sun Apr 12 20:16:58 2015 UTC,You definitely have not overdone yourself! Wales sounds awesome! What some byth mean though? Is that Welsh?

Wales,32cgje,yrhendystu,-16,Sun Apr 12 16:52:45 2015 UTC,"Ok. For starters, what do the Welsh look like? I've always heard that they have darker features because they're the original Britons who came from the Iberian peninsula, is this true? Sorry if that was a loaded question, just curious."
Wales,32cgje,Babirusa1,10,Sun Apr 12 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"I guess you could say darker features, but honestly we just look every other brit. Yes, Welsh (Celts) was one of the original few that lived in Britain With the Scottish and the southern English ones. But as the Anglo-Saxon came over they kind of just fucked up everything and made us all pretty much the same. I hope that answers your question, im not sure if it did haha. Anything else?"
Wales,32cgje,JRD656,6,Sun Apr 12 17:13:54 2015 UTC,Stumpy legs and neck with broad shoulders is my go to description
Wales,32cgje,theemperorsfist,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:48:07 2015 UTC,"The Welsh are apparently more distinctive than the rest of the UK genetically, and also bear more resemblance to the original colonisers of the British Isles.  I also think they have a distinctive appearance, although it is so subtle I couldn't describe it."
Wales,32cgje,JRD656,-11,Mon Apr 13 04:42:10 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... I've got a lot of questions but now that I think about it, google probably could answer them. And I'm sure you've got anything better to do, haha."
Wales,32cgje,Babirusa1,2,Sun Apr 12 17:16:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it doesn't bother me, Ask away. Haha, this is a good time waster man, better than just scrolling through reddit all day."
Wales,32cgje,JRD656,-12,Sun Apr 12 17:24:18 2015 UTC,"Haha, ain't that the truth! Well, can you guys tell me a little bit of the history of Wales?"
Wales,32a0xy,NinjaNorris110,3,Sat Apr 11 23:07:38 2015 UTC,"Historically the name has been spelled with one L, like in the case of Llywelyn ein Llyw Olaf. But if you've seen modern spellings of the name with two L's I have no idea why it's pronounced the way you've heard. Hope this helps a bit :)"
Wales,32a0xy,orw1,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot more sense, thanks. :)"
Wales,32a0xy,logicalmaniak,1 point,Sun Apr 12 08:38:07 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_(name)#Etymology - gives Llewelyn as the most standard spelling. Apparently it comes from two old British gods, Lugh (Lleu) and Belenus (Belyn).   So the ""Ll"" sound in the beginning and the ""l"" sound in the middle of Llewelyn is the oldest pronunciation."
Wales,32a0xy,Torchedkiwi,3,Sat Apr 18 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"Misspelling, or an Anglicisation of the original name, same as how Llywelyn is pronounced as 'Lywelyn' in English sometimes."
Wales,32a0xy,logicalmaniak,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I knew welsh didn't have any weird exceptions like that so it had to have been some weird bastardisation. Thanks"
Wales,3237pn,ilikecatsalot,3,Fri Apr 10 05:20:39 2015 UTC,"In North Wales, if you are an experienced backpacker with a good head for heights, then certainly you should consider walking the Snowdon Horseshoe.       The nearby village of Llanberis is a centre for rock-climbing, and has lots of places to stay, ranging from hotels to hostels to camping. It also has a 13th century castle, Dolbadarn, which was built by Llewelyn the Great. There are lots of other interesting walks, of varying degrees of difficulty, and the world heritage site of Caernarfon Castle, and nearby Roman fort, is only about seven miles away."
Wales,3237pn,newydd,2,Fri Apr 10 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"I won't be able to do the Snowdon horseshoe. I have vertigo and accordingly I'm extremely terrified of heights and narrow ridges; I'll be alone, and without my partner to help me through, I will become paralysed and won't be able to do it. I am otherwise a fairly experienced and strong backpacker, though I don't rock climb. Do you have high recommendations for any other routes?"
Wales,3237pn,newydd,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:38:55 2015 UTC,"There is so much! What about a coastal walk? Or a railway trip combined with a hike? Or a forest walk?  Will you have a car? Do you want to camp or stay in a hotel or hostel? Do you want a route which is circular or linear?      I live near Caernarfon and Llanberis, so I can suggest a lot more if you can be a bit more specific about what you want.      Just noticed your user name. Our cat approves!"
Wales,3237pn,legobunny,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:27:12 2015 UTC,"I will have a car, but I want to walk as much as possible. I will have full backpacking outfit, tent, food, water pump, etc. I'm not necessarily interesting in topping any of the big mountains, but rather rambling about and stumbling upon some great forests, castles, ruins, etc. while taking in some great scenery. Circular routes would be great!"
Wales,3237pn,RConnz,3,Sat Apr 11 07:22:16 2015 UTC,"I went to the Brecon Beacons (one of the more easy hikes they have around the waterfall area) just a little while ago and enjoyed it tremendously. It's probably even nicer now that the weather seems to be so much better.  Hiking up one of the higher hills here is also really nice, especially because you can easily combined that with a few hours in Brecon or Hay."
Wales,3237pn,xBwainFweeze,3,Fri Apr 10 13:35:22 2015 UTC,"I can recommend the beaches in and around the Gower, near Swansea, rated some of the nicest beaches in the world. Me and my girlfriend always enjoy walking down there."
Wales,3237pn,Ferrisuk,2,Fri Apr 10 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"I live in the Rhondda Valleys, full of rich history and lush beautiful greenery, you should also check out Llanwonno. Which has some great welsh stories."
Wales,3237pn,ROBOTNIXONSHEAD,2,Fri Apr 10 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of nice trails up and aroubd castle coch, I think the taff trail runs through there."
Wales,3237pn,Yarg,2,Fri Apr 10 20:10:27 2015 UTC,Offa's Dyke for a fairly smooth path with many cozy pubs and nice locals. Or any part of the coastal path from Pembrookshire to Aberystwyth for some amazing scenery. You really are spoilt for choice!
Wales,3237pn,Ddraig_Coch,2,Fri Apr 10 21:18:54 2015 UTC,The Black Mountain in the Brecon Beacons will always be my favourite spot:  http://www.breconbeacons.org/black-mountain-range
Wales,3237pn,Ddraig_Coch,2,Fri Apr 10 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"I hate to give away my favourite place, but personally I love to go Upto blue lake near Barmouth/fairbourne in North Wales, it's pretty hidden away but locals can point you in the right direction, bit of a steep walk aswell at some points but it's great and well worth it for the views"
Wales,321vl0,ilikecatsalot,6,Thu Apr 9 22:22:45 2015 UTC,"If your interest is primarily hiking and stunning scenery, then I would recommend North Wales and Snowdonia if you want epic amd rugged mountains and Brecon Beacons if you want more rolling hills which are not as steep. The local villages and market towns are probably more quaint in the south but the north has better historical sites, ie Caernarfon castle."
Wales,321vl0,TCamilo19,4,Fri Apr 10 01:10:20 2015 UTC,"Oh this is my question all over. I live in the beacons and uni in Snowdonia.  For history I would go to Snowdonia, there are some absolutely fantastic castles up there."
Wales,321vl0,Fatherlorris,3,Fri Apr 10 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"The best route is definitely National Cycle Route 8 (Lon Las Cymru). It will take you through the Beacons by default, and if you take a detour between Porthmadog and Caenarfon you can pass through Snowdonia as well."
Wales,321vl0,ocamlmycaml,2,Fri Apr 10 01:43:41 2015 UTC,"Snowdonia every time, far more spectacular"

Wales,319c6o,wiseprogressivethink,13,Fri Apr 3 01:01:55 2015 UTC,"A consequence of her strategy: she chose to focus in on Welsh issues rather than taking a more ambassadorial role, as Sturgeon did. May well be the right decision - Plaid has to focus on getting its message across to Welsh voters, whereas the everyone in Scotland knows what the SNP's about.  This is less people saying that Wood lost the debate and more them saying that they simply weren't interested in what she had to say.  Not sure it means anything much. What matters for Wood and her party is how she was received amongst Welsh voters, which is still an unknown AFAIK."
Wales,319c6o,KaiserMacCleg,4,Fri Apr 3 01:19:53 2015 UTC,Do you know if there will be any Wales specific polls coming out?
Wales,319c6o,WobsJack,4,Fri Apr 3 10:37:05 2015 UTC,"No idea, but I hope so. ITV are the most active media organisation in the field of Welsh political polling, so I think there's a fair chance we may see something, given time.  In the meanwhile, I've put together a short survey here to satisfy my own curiosity. Not that the results will be indicative of anything much."
Wales,319c6o,KaiserMacCleg,3,Fri Apr 3 12:26:49 2015 UTC,Where would this community be without you Kaiser?  Excellent idea.
Wales,319c6o,WobsJack,5,Fri Apr 3 12:36:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair to her, this is a UK wide poll; she focused on Welsh issues (to the point of name dropping places like the Rhondda, the Valleys etc, and at some points I'm sure a lot of viewers in the rest of the UK probably didn't know what she was talking about, with Assembly politics and such), and Wales is only about 4.8% of the UK population, so I suppose it's not too much of a surprise she's scored so low. In the end it only matters what the Welsh population thinks, since we're the only ones who will be able to vote for Plaid.  But it's a testament to how well Sturgeon did that she was able to win the hearts of people across the UK, even though only Scotland (~8.3% of the UK population) can vote for her, and part of that was due to how she mostly focused on UK wide issues with a Scottish spin, which makes sense seeing as it's possible they could have quite a bit of power over the whole of the UK depending on what happens. I've also seen quite a few people on Twitter saying that they would vote for the SNP if they ran in England, which is a bit of a weird concept when you think about it."
Wales,319c6o,SirBlah,4,Fri Apr 3 03:16:11 2015 UTC,"Why don't they run in England? I mean, just for giggles?"
Wales,319c6o,yrhendystu,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:55:39 2015 UTC,"Even most Plaid people would have voted Sturgeon as the best because she was quite simply miles ahead of the opposition.  This is a similar method to the first past the post system which I'm sure many of us do not agree with. 'Winning' the debate is also not what people should be focused on, they should be focused on whether they agreed with the person or not."

Wales,319c6o,UnoAcoustic,7,Fri Apr 3 07:24:06 2015 UTC,"No, the headline's right - the fewest people thought she performed best. It doesn't give any information about the overall relative standings (for example for all we know 98% of people could have thought she performed second best)."
Wales,317ntb,KaiserMacCleg,6,Thu Apr 2 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"After losing faith in the other parties, Plaid are pretty much the only party left that I would consider voting for and this TV debate reaffirmed that for me. Leanne argued well and stood up for the most vulnerable Welsh communities, only to be ignored by the likes of Miliband who just wants to talk about his precious taxes.  Leanne is right as well, Labour represents a huge majority of Wales yet absolutely nothing gets done in Wales to support the people who live here. We represent some of the poorest communities in the whole of the EU and it's been that way for decades.   I might not agree with all of Plaid's policies but I think we are well overdue to have some people in government who will represent our interests and not London's for once."
Wales,317ntb,samaiwa,14,Fri Apr 3 10:29:32 2015 UTC,"I think Leanne did well. Always going to be difficult arguing Wales' case on a UK platform because 90 something % don't want to hear it. The important thing is that Welsh issues got some air time.   I have to say though, I thought Sturgeon was brilliant. A strong SNP showing can only help Plaid so I think we should celebrate that.   The main thing is that Wales got some bloody attention for once. We have been too easy to ignore and its time we made ourselves heard. Whatever you think of Leanne Wood and Plaid it took balls to do what she did today, to go out there and talk like that when you know the majority of the audience don't want to listen takes guts."
Wales,317ntb,WobsJack,6,Thu Apr 2 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"I think Wales and the people of Wales do need to mobilise behind a progressive Wales-centric party, not out of some desire for independence but so that we can more effectively argue with a Welsh voice in government. I liked a lot of what Leanne Wood said tonight. It was great to hear a Welsh perspective. We're here, too, and we're also not basically-England."
Wales,317ntb,haloraptor,6,Thu Apr 2 22:19:01 2015 UTC,Spot on mate. Does my head in to be honest.   I just get the feeling we in Wales don't back ourselves enough. I think given decent opportunities and proper funding we could start to sort some of our problems out ourselves. Give us exactly the same powers as Scotland and let us sink or swim. We should be prepared to put our neck on the line and take a jump. We have been marginalised for far too long and it is about time we took some initiative.
Wales,317ntb,WobsJack,8,Thu Apr 2 22:30:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Say what you like about the SNP, no one can argue that they aren't bloody fantastic at fighting Scotland's corner.

Clearly, Plaid and Leanne decided to focus relentlessly on Welsh issues, which was never going to play well across the whole UK, so no surprise to see her low poll ratings after the debates. Sturgeon appeared to be more successful in marrying a unique Scottish perspective with making the case for the relevance of the SNP to voters elsewhere, by putting her party's anti-austerity agenda at the forefront.  How Leanne's performance played in Wales is, of course, far more important to Plaid, and I don't think anything can be said about that at this early stage. I hope to see a poll or two on that subject, in time. After all, ITV does commission those Welsh Political Barometer polls."

Wales,30x8m6,SirBlah,7,Tue Mar 31 13:23:53 2015 UTC,"It's such a shame that in this First Past the Post system, that voting for smaller parties often feels like a wasted vote to many. Not to say it is, as a vote shows support and higher percentages encourage others."
Wales,30x8m6,WhyArrest,8,Tue Mar 31 20:21:36 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for a Ceredigion swing to Plaid - they're the second party here after the Lib Dems. Certainly encouraging my housemates to vote for Plaid. And we're all technically English.
Wales,30x8m6,thecritic06,1 point,Wed Apr 1 11:42:38 2015 UTC,"Just had a look at Ceredigion. The Lib Dems have taken a beating here but it looks like their votes have been snapped up by Lab, UKIP and Greens rather than going to Plaid."
Wales,30x8m6,WhyArrest,3,Wed Apr 1 15:25:10 2015 UTC,I live in New Zealand and we use MMP here. Basically you are allocated a percentage of seats in parliament based on the percentage of the vote you got. This gives a lot more power to smaller  parties and I think it's a much better system. However it does mean that if no party gets >50% of the vote then they'll form a coalition with a smaller party (often only having 1 or 2 seats) which gives that party a lot more influence than it otherwise would get.
Wales,30x8m6,Raticide,2,Tue Mar 31 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"We use a similar system (the additional member system - AMS) for elections to the Welsh Assembly, but there are no balance seats in the constituency votes as there are in MMP, so some parties (read: Labour) still get more seats than their vote share would allow if we used PR.   It's not a bad system, and it does introduce an element of proportionality to elections, but we could do a lot better."
Wales,30x8m6,KaiserMacCleg,2,Wed Apr 1 00:41:02 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, most votes are wasted under FPTP, even most of those cast for the major parties.   A vote for Labour in the Rhondda or Neath is a wasted vote. They were always going to win there anyway.  A vote for the Tories in Ceredigion is a wasted vote. They never stood a chance.  The only votes which actually decide the outcome of the election are those cast for the main contenders in a small number of swing seats across the country (caveat: the number of swing seats isn't that small this time round, as most of Scotland is set to elect new SNP MPs). Any individual vote cast in a safe seat is wasted, no matter who it was cast for.   I've always been of the opinion that you should vote for what you truly believe in, rather than the second-worst option. Plaid comes closest to fitting the bill for me, and so they've got my vote, even here in Clwyd South where they stand zero chance of winning."
Wales,30x8m6,KaiserMacCleg,2,Tue Mar 31 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with what you're saying.

From the 90's the market moved on from small ""amusement parks"" to ""theme parks"" with rollercoasters, and the owners simply kept their heads in the sand about that; it's the reason why Oakwood became such a success even though it started out much the same way that Barry Island did, and is located in the middle of the Pembrokeshire countryside.  Still, I think it's possible to turn it around, it's in a really ideal location: 10km or so from Cardiff, it's own train station with about 3 trains an hour to Cardiff Central.

In my first year of university I wrote an essay on the link between language/identity in Wales and this was the overwhelming result. English speakers in the south (for example) identify more with the English across the border than they do with Welsh speakers in Wales, and Welsh speakers identify more with their fellow Welsh speakers regardless of geographical proximity. So don't feel bad about it; English speakers tend to make similar distinctions!

My experience of being Welsh is competing in Eisteddfods and going to school with half the bloody cast of Rownd a Rownd, and having Welsh language culture as such a strong presence means that I'd be more likely to share my interpretation of Welshness with another first language speaker that I could identify with.   This is just my personal manifestation of nationalistic feeling though. I'd identify with a non Welsh speaker from Cardiff as being Welsh too, but it'd be different because we couldn't bond over things like watching Cefn Gwlad with Dai Jones Llanilar et cetera."

For Nuttall to make these comments shows a great deal of ignorance at best, arrogance at worst.

Overall, a cracking championship. How we are rueing that second half against England...who were shredded by Ireland...and should have destroyed Scotland in the first 20 minutes last week. The game is as exciting as it's ever been, and the naysayers will need to rethink their criticisms after this years thrilling denouement. And France!

Wales,2zmmex,newydd,5,Fri Mar 20 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"For many years, when I lived in London, I was a member of the Labour Party. After the defeat of the Labour left in the early 1980s I became more and more disillusioned. Blair's time as leader took the party too far to the right, in my view, and after the Iraq fiasco I decided that I couldn't support them any longer. Brown's role in the Scotland referendum campaign just served to confirm my decision.  Now I live in North Wales, and I will probably vote Plaid because they are closer to being a genuine anti-centralist socialist party than Labour. They are also consistent in their opposition to Trident.  Leanne Wood is an admirable politician who has broadened Plaid's appeal, particularly outside the Welsh-language heartlands.       The perceived language issue deters many people who don't speak Welsh. This is a shame because the true Plaid position is to move towards a genuinely bilingual society, with equal status for both  main languages of Wales."

Just seems like their ideas are naive and jumping the gun - they need the backing first and they're not even the 3rd party in Wales... after this election they still might not be with UKIP's bump in support. What is different between SNP and Plaid is: SNP are making headway because Labour alienated the Scottish people and Plaid have not clicked that the Welsh people may want a voice - but they do not want Independence like the SNP found out last September.  Look at the debates on TV... Leanne talked over other people when they were saying their piece while the UKIP guy just stood there quiet until spoken too. Something I don't like about politics is their inability to take turns and just give each other a chance to speak. It's not a bitching contest its the future of our people.  Plaid... It's not just jumping the gun its that I'm not sure what they're offering Welsh Labour do not... I would like to see a bigger turn back towards Welsh culture... ultimately our culture brought us down - the Princes and Kings broke their land equally between their sons and it cost them Wales. That equality. Women also had more rights in Wales than most other nations in Europe... and this was 1200... That's something we should probably be proud of in our defeat - or maybe slumber is a better word.  We were before our time and we paid for it with our nation. Ultimately it comes down to the voters: Scotland has a Scottish voice and I'd like to see Wales have a Welsh voice and not an appendage of the greater Labour party. What does Ed Miliband know about England let alone the ex-minning towns of the Welsh valleys? :/

I don't feel any more Welsh than any other person who identifies as Welsh. There's an abundance of people who cannot speak Welsh who  will have a greater interest in Welsh affairs, politics or history than me.

Wales,2z4wyy,KaiserMacCleg,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:16:58 2015 UTC,I think the Celtic languages split off from Indo-European earlier than other language families. I'm not sure if it's the oldest but Celtic languages are certainly unique compared to other European languages.  Thanks for your answer :D
Wales,2z4wyy,Aurlios,5,Mon Mar 16 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"This will be a rather long and convoluted answer, and I apologise, but there is quite a lot to go into.  Historically, the Welsh language has been absolutely integral to Welsh identity, because for a long time after the annexation by England, the language was almost the only defining characteristic of Welshness that remained untouched by our conquerors. At one time, Wales had its own laws, its own ecclesiastical traditions, a different form of social stratification to that found in England, as well as a far more rural (even semi-nomadic, for parts of the population) way of life.   Gradually, that all got eroded as the Middle Ages progressed. The Catholic Church eclipsed the native Celtic Church, and Wales became included in the archbishopric of Canterbury. Society came to strongly resemble a typical feudal pyramid under the Princes. Poltical independence was brought to an end in the 13th century. The English established a series of fortified towns across the country after the conquest, introducing a more urban way of life into the country.  By the time that Welsh law was done away with by Henry VIII in the 16th century, the language and folk traditions were really all that the Welsh nation had left, and that's the way it stayed for a long time. An English speaker in Medieval Wales (even if (s)he also spoke Welsh, was born and raised in Wales etc.) was a saes to the rest of the community - a Saxon.     That began to change in the 18th century. It was at this time that nonconformism (various forms of protestantism that did not subscribe to the Church of England brand of Christianity) was sweeping the country, and the nonconformists found particularly fertile ground in Wales. Wales soon became a country of chapels, male voice choirs and firebrand preachers, much removed from the safe, tepid Christianity of the Church.  In the nineteenth century, Wales' legal distinctiveness began to be re-established, thanks to laws like the Sunday Closing Act which applied only to Wales. The turn of the century saw the establishment of the first truly national Welsh institutions: the University of Wales in 1893; the National Museum in 1905 and the National Library in 1907.   The twentieth and twenty-first centuries has seen a return of a degree of political autonomy - first through the Welsh Office and later through the National Assembly and Welsh Government.    And at the same time, the language has declined. By the time it became a minority language in Wales in 1911, conceptions of what it meant to be Welsh were already moving towards a more civic identity, based around institutions and not language or lineage.   After Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, was founded in 1925, it was long torn in two directions. One wing of the party, lead by Saunders Lewis, espoused a form of cultural and linguistic nationalism. For them, Wales was all about the language, and apocalyptic predictions of its imminent demise was what motivated them above all else. The other wing of the party espoused a more civic form of nationalism. The Wales they aspired to create was a Wales of grand institutions and popular sovereignty. The civic nationalists won, and as a consequence the language has sometimes taken a back seat to Plaid's ambitions of nation building. The party has always remained sympathetic to the language, but it has been less forceful in promoting it than it might have been; certainly less so than Cymdeithas yr Iaith, Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg etc.  Plaid's internal tussle mirrors what has gone on, a little less visibly, across Wales as a whole.    In closing, the language is and always will be important to the Welsh identity, but it isn't as central as it used to be and it certainly isn't the case that one must speak Welsh before (s)he can be Welsh. After all, if we held ourselves to the standards of the Middle Ages, there would be no nation left. We'd all be Saxons."

Our persistence as a people has made it thrive and now Welsh medium education is oversubscribed because of it. O bydded i'r hen iaith barhau. (O may the old language endure) is in the anthem ffs.   It also enables me to fully immerse myself in both Hwntws and Gog culture. ATM I can only really be a part of a small section of Welsh culture from the Marches.

Wales,2z4wyy,BluePandaBear,4,Mon Mar 16 15:14:25 2015 UTC,"Well thank you for asking. And I see some people have given some excellent answers I really can't compete with.  I'm not a Welsh speaker. Never have been and never will be besides a few sentences and words that you see on signs and things (Wales is bilingually signposted).  I imagine that for many Welsh speakers it's a source of enormous pride. For me, it's something I'm proud of in the sense that it's something Wales has that no other country has, and you need those kinds of things to call yourself a country.  Does not speaking it make me less Welsh than people who do? I would say that in principle, it does not. But in practice, possibly: I'm a linguist, I speak French fluently and I'm doing a degree in Japanese; the fact I haven't made an effort to learn Welsh is probably indicative that I don't consider being Welsh to be an integral part of my identity on a fundamental level. Although it might not be popular to say here, I am probably more British than Welsh (British, not English).  On the other hand, I have friends who are extremely proud of being Welsh who speak even less than I do. My parents are of a generation where knowing Welsh in my part of the country was extremely rare, but my dad is more proud of being Welsh than I am.  I think that as a German, it's clearly difficult for you to empathise with that because for you, language has never been dissociated from culture or identity (excluding those few ethnic Germans whose countries changed hands during the 20th century). But for us, it's been usual to speak English and be Welsh for many, many years. We have a history of Welsh-English poets, Welsh-English has its own vernacular, its own accent.  Hope that helps."

Wales,2z4wyy,KaiserMacCleg,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:09:33 2015 UTC,"I agree. I was taught in an English speaking school, where Welsh lessons were compulsory. This meant most students ignored these lessons, as they felt there was no real need to learn the language due to its limited use in South Wales.   I believe Welsh lessons would have been more beneficial if they were optional, meaning only those students that really wanted to learn the language would be taught, without the disruption of the students that did not care about the subject language.   I personally did not take much notice in these lessons, as I felt concentrating on Maths/English/Science was more important because these are the subjects employers are asking for.   As for today, I work in a multi billion pound firm in South Wales, where the use of Welsh is non existent and not necessary."
Wales,2z4wyy,HadrasVorshoth,2,Sun Mar 15 21:41:02 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the problem is that Welsh is taught too late, and not enough (a problem that the UK has a whole seams to have with language learning). Outside Welsh medium schools Welsh language lessons feel like a tacked on sort of thing, I can't imagine many people becoming fluent with them even if they wanted to, I know I didn't. I'd also say the same about foreign language learning as well, unless you take the subject further, you're probably not going to know much more then how to say Hello in French by the time you leave.  If we really want Wales to be a bilingual society then we should make all our nurseries and infant school's bilingual, with children learning Welsh though immersion. That would basically guarantee that every child in Wales would be fluent in both Welsh and English.  Whether or not they choose to use it would be their own decision, and I'm sure there would be a few that would loose their fluent-ness, but at the very least I'd imagine there would be less animosity over the language if they've known it all their lives, rather then something they're forced to learn later in life.  ...I imagine this would be a pretty radical undertaking, I'm not sure how parents would react to this, plus the teacher training and everything. It would have to a phased process, probably slowly starting in the areas around the Welsh language heartlands outwards."
Wales,2z4wyy,ginger_jedi,0,Mon Mar 16 06:45:42 2015 UTC,I always think this is a silly argument.  You could say the same about religious education or art.  I didn't like those subjects and never use anything I learned from them.   Perhaps they should be optional too?  Compulsory Welsh is 1 or 2 hours a week.  It doesn't detract from the importance of the core subjects just as art or RE doesn't. School is meant to provide a broad education.

But what little I do know, I don't need in the South because nobody bothers unless you go to Clwb Ifor Bach.

Wales,2z4wyy,HadrasVorshoth,4,Mon Mar 16 15:11:00 2015 UTC,"Total funding allocated to Welsh Government departments for the financial year 2014-15: £15.3bn    The budget of the Welsh Language Commissioner in 2014-15: £3.69m (10% cut on the last financial year).    The allocation for the Welsh language within the wider Education & Skills budget (including spending on Welsh in schools): £24.38m (3% cut on the last financial year).    Total identifiable expenditure on the Welsh language in the financial year 2014-15 by the Welsh Government: £28.07m, or 0.18% of the Welsh Government's budget.    Figures on road signs and government literature are harder to come by, because there is no specific budget set for such things: the government has a commitment to bilingualism and as such those costs will be spread across all government departments. Regardless, it's a proverbial drop in the ocean. Road signs do not require huge capital investments in the first place, and will only require replacing infrequently. Train announcements are the province of Network Rail and Arriva Trains Wales, not the government.  You're getting angry over peanuts. In 2008, we subsidised the financial elites to the tune of £500 billion (17812.6113 times the Welsh Government's expenditure on the Welsh Language this year), and we didn't stop there. If you want to get angry about something, get angry about that.  EDIT: Actually, having done a bit more reading, I think spending on the Welsh Language Commissioner comes out of the budget of the Welsh Language Division (whose budget is included in the Education & Skills budget), so I've probably counted her budget twice. Cymdeithas yr Iaith cites a figure of 0.16% of expenditure, which would be consistent with considering only the budget allocated to the Welsh Language Division."
Wales,2z4wyy,Brochfael,2,Mon Mar 16 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I see my capacity to speak welsh as merely a tool. I use it to get into jobs, I use it to 'sound like an elf' in roleplaying games. It helps with business, it can be useful for fun, and that's it.  But then I had bad experiences with the Welsh language (from being illegally put into a special needs class whilst I picked up the language whilst in a Welsh school to a extremist Welsh nationalist primary school teacher pinching and scratching me whenever I slipped into English whenever I was alone with him), and most people I know either don't speak Welsh, or can, but prefer to speak in English because it's genuinely easier. Plus in Secondary School, there was an expectation in Second Language classes of ""oh you don't know this thing I haven't taught you and you didn't know was even a thing that's coming up later in the year in a class where there was no recommended textbook to revise from?  Why are you even taking this class idiot even though its the first bloody month of you doing this A Level, demoralise demoralise demoralise"".  I pretty much re-learned everything from scratch after I left school, because my teachers were jerks. So, to me, the Welsh language has no cultural identity status. It's just bad memories and a metaphorical screwdriver on my metaphorical toolbelt of skills.  I do think the language is cool though. Just.. The fact that it's a minority language makes a few paranoid people crazy enough to actively hurt and abuse children who aren't picking up an entire language fast enough for their liking."

Wales,2ydynr,jimofwales,8,Mon Mar 9 11:42:23 2015 UTC,"It's a national embarrassment for Wales to have such shoddy public transport. No North-South rail link, no electrified rail, not a single metro system even in Cardiff yet Westminster probably just look at a sheet of statistics and think ""Oh a lot of people have cars there, they should be alright then"".  Meanwhile it takes longer for me to get from Cardiff to Trefforest than it does for me to get from Cardiff to Bristol and if I want to travel within the eastern side of Cardiff, my only option as someone who doesn't own a car is to get a bus into town and then get a bus from town to the district I want to go, thus turning what should be a ten minute journey into an hour long or more just because East Cardiff is inaccessible via rail. I'd probably find it quicker to walk there if the A470 wasn't in the way, cutting off pedestrians.  Wales is in desperate need of innovation and positive change in public transport, otherwise we will find it very difficult to compete on an international level."

You should try and book a reserved seat if you take that route as trains are very busy on match days,  Might be worth ringing Cardiff Tourist Information Centre on +44 29 2087 3573 as they may be able to help with accommodation.  I'll post you some tourist info later when I get home from work."

Wales,2wzdug,gomezadams,2,Thu Feb 26 14:19:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry I got waylaid! :)  OK Cardiff is a great city with lots of open space, yet still remaining relatively compact  to get around.  I don't know what kind of stuff you are into so here's a selection off the top of my head.If you come back to with some interests I'll try and be more specific.  First up would be Cardiff Castle, a stones throw from the Stadium.  It was created by renowned architect William Burges for the third Marquis of Bute, who was reputedly the richest man in the world at the time.  Check out the elaborate gargoyles along the walls.  Wrapped around the Castle you'll also find Bute Park, 130 acres of landscaped gardens. ""A rambling riverside beauty spot with an arboretum, Victorian gardens, friary ruins and a cafe""  A few miles outside the city you'll find St Fagans National History Museum. Over 40 buildings, from an Iron Age Celtic village to a row of ironworkers’ houses have been painstakingly rebuilt in 60 acres of beautiful gardens.  Worth the trip to eat Bara Brith - a traditional Welsh fruit and tea cake - hot from the oven at the in museum bakery.  The National Museum right in the civic centre has a stunning collection of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings. (All museums in Wales have free entry)  A trip to Cardiff Bay will allow you to see the Wales Millennium Centre - the centre of music and theatre. Alongside many waterside restaurants. You can also take a boat trip along the river Taff. Or a fast boat ride out to the Cardiff Barrage. There's also the Cardiff International White Water Centre, where you can get very wet.  If you're feeling geeky there's the Dr Who Experience as well as a few landmarks from Torchwood.  How's that?  Tell me how long are you staying and what are you interested in if you want more."
Wales,2wzdug,gomezadams,1 point,Thu Feb 26 19:59:19 2015 UTC,"No problem, thanks for taking the time to write all that out :)  We're probably going to be traveling on a tight budget - the rugby ticket and transportation/accomodation already burned holes in our wallets - so boat rides and event stuff like the White Water Centre are probably out of the question. We're currently planning to stay in the Cardiff area for an extended weekend, somewhere between 3 and 5 nights in total, and then get on the road and see some more of Wales and possibly south England. Game evenings will be spent in pubs watching the games of course!  The Castle and National History Museum sound great! I'm not sure if we'll be in the mood for art - but we're all definitely interested in learning what we can about welsh history and culture while we're there!  Advice for cheap, good value eateries or good pubs is also definitely welcome, as is advice about which local food we have to try. And also which local beer we have to try - we're Germans after all ;)   (All museums in Wales have free entry)   That's awesome, we'll be sure to take advantage of that!"
Wales,2wzdug,gyda_dwp,2,Thu Feb 26 23:06:20 2015 UTC,"Cardiff City Centre is pretty compact which is good for getting around but does mean that the City itself and many of the eating & drinking establishments can get very busy on match days.  Also the city centre is full of chains, so you sometimes need to get a little out of the centre to get to some of the better independent places.  Here's a few places to Google anyway.  The City Arms on Quay Street (www.thecityarmscardiff.com), opposite the stadium, and The Old Arcade on Church Street (www.sabrain.com/oldarcade) are very atmospheric.  O’Neill’s or Walkabout on St Mary Street, both of which have massive roll-down projector screens are good for match watching.  Mochyn Du (Black Pig) Sophia Close.  Good for Welsh regional ale before watching the rugby on the TV. There are screens dotted around the pub, serves food too – the winter menu includes everything from fish and chips to cawl. (see later)  Another place to drink would be The Goat Major on the High Street.  Wales has some fantastic food and food producers. Traditionally known for leeks, Welsh lamb and Welsh black beef any dish containing those should be good.  Cawl is a traditional Welsh stew or broth made with lamb and veg. Another dish synonymous with Wales would be Welsh Rarebit - a sort of fancy cheese on toast.  You should also try Bara Brith (literally speckled bread) is a fruit loaf made with tea.  Last but not least you need to sample the delights of a Welsh Cake. A small spiced fruit cake cooked on a griddle or bake stone.  Get them from Cardiff Bakestones in the Central Market.  For good value food and drink try Brew Dog, Urban Tap House, Coffee at The Plan in Morgan Arcade or Coffee Barker in Castle Arcade (There's a Tea Barker too if you're that way inclined)  There are loads of great cheap ethnic restaurants around Cardiff.  You'll find some of them on my food blog http://www.corpulentcapers.com and even more on my mate Ed Gilberts http://gourmetgorro.blogspot.co.uk/  Enjoy!"

Firstly, you're lucky; you'll find lots of relevant people in Aberystwyth who can help with this. I would strongly advise getting in direct contact with Cymdeithas yr Iaith, the Welsh department at the university, the ultra-Welsh student community (just go hang around Pantycelyn...), /r/Cymru, and using to Twitter to find people (better than here - I guarantee people will help).   I don't live in Wales anymore and I'm not really involved enough with nationalism to be of any use, but I know there will be a lot of people delighted to help you with this. If I were you I'd aim for the younger members of Cymdeithas yr Iaith (cartloads of which will be the offspring of the nationalists of the 60s) and then maybe seek out people like Ffred Ffransis and Dafydd Iwan.  Also, the Welsh music scene and it's influence on (+the influence had on it) by nationalist movements even up to this day is an aspect I personally would be interested in if I were doing this. Recommend the book ''Blerwytirhwng?' The Place of Welsh Pop Music'.  Anyway, pob lwc! Sounds like an interesting dissertation! :)"

It makes no sense.   Edit: Found this on Wikipedia  ""The name derives from a Brythonic word Gobannia meaning ""river of the blacksmiths"", and relates to the town's pre-Roman importance in iron smelting. The name is related to the modern Welsh word gof (blacksmith), and so is also associated with the Welsh smith Gofannon from folklore. The river later became, in Welsh, Gafenni, and the town's name became Abergavenny, meaning ""mouth of (Welsh: Aber) the Gavenny (Gafenni)"". In Welsh, the shortened form Y Fenni may have come into use for a very short period after about the 15th century, although pronounced similarly in English or Welsh the English spelling Abergavenny is in general use."""

The term ""racism"" is widely used by practically everyone in society to mean far more than discrimination on the basis of race alone. That tendency extends up to the state itself: in this section of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, a ""racial group"" is described as ""a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins"".

Wales,2tzyp5,pauljaye,1 point,Thu Jan 29 13:52:29 2015 UTC,"Thorium-based nuclear power:       Thorium-based nuclear power is nuclear reactor-based electrical power generation fueled primarily by the fission of the isotope uranium-233 produced from the fertile element thorium. According to proponents, a thorium fuel cycle offers several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle—including much greater abundance on Earth, superior physical and nuclear fuel properties, and reduced nuclear waste production. However, development of thorium power has significant start-up costs. Proponents also cite the lack of weaponization potential as an advantage of thorium, while critics say that development of breeder reactors in general (including thorium reactors that are breeders by nature) increase proliferation concerns. Since about 2008, nuclear energy experts have become more interested in thorium to supply nuclear fuel in place of uranium to generate nuclear power. This renewed interest has been highlighted in a number of scientific conferences, the latest of which, ThEC13   was held at CERN by iThEC and attracted over 200 scientists from 32 countries.

Even Kirsty Williams, who I usually find to be insufferable.  Unless her performance is disastrously bad, though, I don't think this could possibly hurt Plaid. The party's biggest problem is exposure: it doesn't get any. These debates, if they actually go ahead as planned, will provide Plaid with the chance to remedy that, and  thereby grab the attention of the Welsh electorate. It hasn't had such a chance since the '99 Assembly Election, when it won a higher vote share than the SNP did in Scotland, with almost 30% of all votes cast.  I'm not sure I've ever seen representatives of both Plaid and the SNP in a debate at once. I'll be interested in seeing how that changes the dynamic. It won't be one loony nat against the world in these debates."

Wales,2rnrjh,Weiner_McDingle,2,Wed Jan 7 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"Staying in Machynlleth or Dolgellau wouldn't be a bad start. There are B&Bs aplenty in the area, you're not far from various other attractions and crucially, you're within range of they Dyfi and Hafren Sweetlamb stages, which are the sort of quintessential Welsh rally stages dating back to the days of when it was the RAC. You can also get over to the remote service in Newton without too much hassle.  From there, over to Bala or Llangollen for the next lot - personally either Clocaenog or Dyfnant/Hirnant.  Obviously, logistics wise it won't be that simple, because you've got stuff like stage access/traffic etc etc to worry about, so might be better of hanging around the stage stage and waiting for the second run rather than traipsing through the forest for two miles in the rain, sitting in traffic for an hour and seeing the last car go through the next stage, but that will become clearer nearer the time. Best to go a suitable rally forum for that - it's years since I've been and tended to involve getting up at the crack of dawn and navigating to some obscure bit of foresty road via OS map and then finding a bit of stage. It's probably a bit more organised nowadays.  There are plenty of touristy things in that part of Wales, depending on what you like - castles, mountains, beaches and so forth. Mach is about a two hour drive from Cardiff (well three if you don't know the roads) so if the family are fed up freezing their arses off on a hill in Mid Wales you can take them out to dinner or whatnot."
Wales,2rnrjh,schmung,1 point,Thu Jan 8 13:56:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response.  I think we will end up sticking to one stage for both runs of the stage. Seems to be the easiest logistic wise and from my experience with Rally events here in the US, unless you are working the stages and can drive through them go help marshal the next one, it is tough to drive from place to place then hike in. Even with our relatively small crowds for events.  I also think we'll follow the stages north each day and stay in an area close to each days events. I would like to see and stay in a few different parts of the country and explore it as much as possible for a few days before we head off for the remainder of our trip.  I'm from New England so I'm not too worried about the cold so I won't accept any whining from my wife about being cold, but I guess I could take her to dinner somewhere and feed her.

Wales,2rnrjh,schmung,1 point,Thu Jan 8 14:14:48 2015 UTC,"Haven't been there (Aber) in years, though my sister went to Uni there. It's a reasonably pleasant and scenic place, but if it's natural beauty you're after then head further north up the coast to the likes of Barmouth. Aber is reasonably sized though and the large student contingent means there's bars/pubs and suchlike there.  The area all around Snowdown is nice, though it can be a bit bleak that time of year.   Which way are coming from and where are you going afterwards? Based on that it makes it easier to recommend places. As others have stated, although Wales is a tiny country, getting anywhere in that part of the country takes an age, so if you know where you're going before/after it may be better to be further east/north and therefore closer to half decent transport and larger cities (i.e Liverpool)"

So coming from the south, after possibly either heading to Dublin then Edinburgh then down through England, or we could end up going the opposite direction and ending our trip with the Rally.

It's also fairly convenient for Snowdonia's mountains and walks etc.   Further south I'd suggest perhaps staying in Welshpool or Bala. I have no specific info on these places nor their accommodation offerings. I would say though when choosing a place, to check drive times to where you want to go. Wales is a mountainous country and there are no straight roads from A to B.   Here's some info from the Daily Post (the north's regional newspaper) on last year's rally. There may be something there.   I'd also recommend searching for UK rally forums for people with interest.   I'm based in the north west, you're welcome to ask any questions about the area.

I'm from the south, so a lot of this might not necessarily apply to the north, but it's all pretty much the same.  Food:   Welshcakes. Essentially scone mixture with sultanas, flattened to about the size of your palm and shallow fried, the coated heavily in course sugar. Homemade they are simply stunning, but if you come to Wales then nearly every coffee shop or cafe will sell them. Cawl. This is a lamb stew full of potatoes, root veg (especially leeks) and lovely stuff. Best served with warm bread and welsh cheese. This is best bought in a cafe, generally one that boasts traditional welsh food. Welsh Rabbit. Not what it sounds like - it's basically cheese on toast with more flavour and a slightly saucier texture to the cheese(often called Welsh Rarebit). Some people reckon the name comes from the fact that if a poor man's meat is rabbit, then a Welshman's rabbit is cheese.   Sport.   Rugby (often spelt rygbi, especially by welsh speakers, but it's pronounced the same.) Rugby is everything. The most heated derby is the wales-england game, but I would also reccomend going to see a New Zealand as well, just for the hacka. The atmosphere is incredible, not to mention the singing (I'll come to that later) Football, but only if you'll be coming to Swansea. Our team, Swansea City or just the Swans is the only decent one in Wales (sorry bluebirds...) and we like to remind people of that.   Music  Definitely listen to some traditional tunes on YouTube, though no one's expecting you to learn them. I'd say Canon Lan, Ar Hyd A Nos, The Ashgrove, Cwm Rhondda/bread of Heaven, Sosban Fach, and Suo Gan are the most well known. Also, try to get to know the National Anthem, Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadiau, of only so you know when to come in on the chorus. As long as you can shout ""Gwlad!"" with convition, you'll be sailing.  Also, listen to some Max Boyce - he's writen plenty of funny songs about rugby and welsh life in general. As its in English, I really encourage you to listen to ""Hymns and Arias"", as it has become a bit of a secondary national anthem, and is sung at most Welsh rugby matches (and at Swans games).  Lastly, watch a couple of episodes of Gavin and Stacy, a sitcom about a couple where the girl is welsh and the guy is English. Not serious culture but it gives a good idea about how a lot of south Wales looks and how the accent sounds, as well as language oddities. And by god is it funny.  Not everything in the list is necessary, in fact most of it is probably not, but if you really want to throw yourself in the culture then these are a good place to start.  Good luck!"

Wales,2rks6o,Gorau,1 point,Thu Jan 8 10:32:42 2015 UTC,"not unpopular, but it's hardly a massive community! with cycling there are some very useful blogs/websites with advice though, easily searched in Google.  i think half the problem is wanting to be 'prepared', but in all honesty, with such things as this you'll never feel fully prepared. you just need to get a half decent amount of savings and then the bravery to take the leap! even the best laid plans won't work out so don't worry about having too many of them, just have some goals and go see what happens."
Wales,2rks6o,kr43,1 point,Thu Jan 8 12:07:40 2015 UTC,"You are right in the sense of wanting to be prepared, and I am willing to give a lot on that but the budget seems critical, I wouldn't want to finish early due to a lack of money or broken equipment I am unable to replace. Most blogs and such I have found seem to suggest a similar budget to mine which probably means it can be done cheaper. I guess I need a route and see how long I expect it to take, I can't move in with my parents but I can probably save 1.5 to 2 years of budget per year."

How is mentioning a particular age group any different? 'Young' is clearly being touted as a special virtue along with 'creative and educated'. I would be fine with that if the statement had some balance such as 'as well as more experienced'."

His son, Henry VIII, then proceeded to abolish the very notion of Wales, and annexed it to England in 1536, an event that would see the end of Welsh law and render Wales all but indistinguishable from its much larger neighbour for the next four hundred years...or would have were it not for the persistence of Welsh culture and the Welsh language among the common people.

I imagine there are some other running costs that were added on originally, paying the toll collectors, maintenance of the bridge etc. but it does seem unlikely that it explains the rest of the cost.   Obviously there is also an element of profit for the companies, not sure what that is.  There was also an issue with VAT not being paid on the tolls when it was first opened.

Llandeilo is really worth a look if you're into your castles, though - it's also home to Dinefwr Castle, which was the principal court of the Kingdom of Deheubarth. Although little remains outside the inner ward, Dinefwr is without a doubt the best preserved native Welsh castle there is (Carreg Cennen itself was originally a Welsh construct, but the castle that now crowns the hilltop is Norman)."

I used to live in Cardiff and dreaded weekends in town when the merthyr horde arrived to shit up the streets and fight outside clubs. The accent and dress code is a dead giveaway.
Wales,2psh35,Crustyjuggler001,9,Fri Dec 19 15:09:00 2014 UTC,So can I ask have you ever been to Merthyr?
Wales,2psh35,Crustyjuggler001,-4,Fri Dec 19 15:58:53 2014 UTC,"Only through on the train. Been on the Brecon Beakons in that area, stunning bit of coutryside. However as for the urban areas I have been largely put off by the aforementioned horde of drunkards who loudly destroyed and besmirched the streets on Cardiff. I worked in the town centre on the street at variable times on a weekend as a promoter and the vast majority of people claiming to be from Merthyr quite put me off the idea of visiting. The destructive carnage and bigotry I encountered was unpleasant and most of it not even aimed at myself but other people. I'll admit this has askewed my opinion probably."
Wales,2psh35,Crustyjuggler001,3,Fri Dec 19 21:24:46 2014 UTC,"I'm really sorry that you had a bad experience with a select few residents of Merthyr Tydfil however it's absurd to base your opinion of a town on a few disorderly people.   Take football for example, around the time of the World Cup there are fans that visit foreign places and most of them are decent enough. They are there to enjoy the match and soak up the atmosphere. There are a few however that go just to get drunk and insight violence. If every country based their perception of another country based around the violence they experience a few times a year than I think we could agree that international relations would be very tense.   Please don't base our town on a minority."
Wales,2psh35,Crustyjuggler001,-5,Fri Dec 19 22:06:48 2014 UTC,"I agree it won't be everyone who lives there but seriously this wasn't only a few times. I lived near the Cardiff city centre for 5 years and worked on the streets for one of them as well as just going to town for a night out. It is a regular occurance. Valleys lads just revelled in trashing the place up and fighting. I'm not saying people from Cardiff don't do that too bit it was nowhere near the same extent. Hearing ""Merthyr Massive"" bellowed down the street and seeing a bunch of thugs degrading women, howling rascist remarks amd smashing bottles was scarily uncommon. Your town may well be lovely but the people who leave to visit Cardiff of a weekend are mostly not. I'm not saying all, but the are alot of loud ones that are ruining it for the rest of you."

The shouts of being valleys boys, being told by the people themselves and once by a policeman who I asked after witnessing one of these particularly horrible occasions. The trains coming from that direction through Cathays to Queent St and Central station also. Though the trains could be from different towns alog the way. It's the nearest big city basically. As I said not everyone in Cardiff city centre on a weekend are from Merthyr. Just alot of those that are are particularly aggresive, anti-social and destructive. It's not every weekend and every street, but alot of weekends and mainly kept to Queen Street, Greyfriars road and St Marys street. St Marys street being the worst."

Try to stop some of your citizens travelling. I still have friends in Cardiff so i'll be back. Also thanks for being the first person from Merthyr who wasn't a dick that i've spoken to."
Wales,2psh35,Crustyjuggler001,3,Sat Dec 20 10:49:50 2014 UTC,"Merthyr is a bad place for anyone who knows it.   Well you've said yourself that you don't know it, you've never set foot there, and your opinion of the entire town is informed (for want of a better word) by some lairy dicks on nights out in another city.  Parts of Merthyr have their problems (the Gurnos is a wretched hive of scum and villainy) but there are some decent places and people. Cyfartha Park and Castle are lovely, particularly in the summer."

They have a row of Miner's cottages which show normal life through the ages and at this time of year they are decorated as they would have been for xmas."

I would add if your feeling rich, the times line up and can get a ticket go see Wales play at the millennium stadium. Also I would recommend the smoke haus in Cardiff the food is really nice,  esp the steak. Mind you I am biased on that one as I know people who work there. If your willing to travel them Brecon is worth the trip up the A470, Pen Y Fan is an easy climb if you want exercise.   Probably my fav pub in Cardiff is the Goat Major. I really like this pub, its small and run by Brains so normally has some SA or Rev. James on:  http://www.sabrain.com/goatmajor  I normally like to go eat Faggots peas and chips in the market while people watching:  http://www.cardiff-market.co.uk/  Also the Pear tree is a nice place to have a beer, its not in the Centre though, however it is close to Roath park, which is really nice and you can take a boat out on the lake:  http://www.visitcardiff.com/things-to-do/roath-park-and-lake-p9121 http://www.sabrain.com/peartree  If you go down the bay I'd suggest the water taxi trip as it nice to take in the sights. Also I'd go to the welsh cake shop, they are lovely fresh.  http://www.fabulouswelshcakes.co.uk/index.php  I also quite like Penarth, although its been a while since I have been down there. It has a nice pier:  http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/national-trust-special-places-penarth-7567603  Cardiff does have its own museum, its right in the centre but I have not been in a while:  http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cardiff  St Fagans is good and people who come to Cardiff like it. We used to go there a lot for school so I've not been in a while:  http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans  If you go north of Cardiff you can take in Castle Coch an also Caerphilly castle. If you do I'd suggest popping in to Fagin's as thats a really nice pub (although the locals can be a bit clicky). Also really nice for a meal is the Gwaelod (this is where we normally go for special occasions as everyone likes it).  http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186460-d3792608-Reviews-Fagin_s_Ale_Chop_House-Cardiff_Southern_Wales_Wales.html http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/castell-coch/?lang=en http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/caerphilly-castle/?lang=en http://www.gwaelodinn.co.uk/  A bit further out is rest bay which is a nice beach that is normally quieter than Barry/Porthcawl:  http://www.south-wales.org/2009/rest-bay-porthcawl/  I also really like Ogmore the beach is rocky though.

One day people will look at Blair's reign in the same way as they look at Asquith's.  In a sense, Labour was brilliant in chasing the middle-road, but they went too far and largely annihilated their base.

Wales,2oqjtt,git,3,Tue Dec 9 18:05:24 2014 UTC,"I'm actually more inclined to vote Plaid than I am to vote Green, even as someone who considers theirself a lefty socialist environmentalist.    The Greens present themselves as the nice environmentalist vote, but their policies are fucktarded.  Ignoring their view of (or rather, entire dismissal of) economics even, they take tons of literally crazy positions on all sorts of topics.  They're not only anti-science, they're fucking insane."
Wales,2oqjtt,KaiserMacCleg,3,Tue Dec 9 23:00:31 2014 UTC,"You're not wrong.  It's worth pointing out, though, that Plaid too is seriously conflicted when it comes to nuclear power. It is official party policy to oppose the construction of new nuclear power plants in Wales, but the leadership and the assembly group have a long history of ignoring party policy on this particular issue and supporting Wylfa B, leaving them open to allegations of hypocrisy.  As a member of the party, this leaves me somewhat conflicted. On the one hand, I agree that nuclear should be a part of Wales' (and the UK's) future energy mix, and I support the construction of Wylfa B. On the other, I worry about the leadership's continued decision to blatantly overrule the wishes of conference. Plaid is traditionally a very democratic party - every party member can propose and vote on policy at conference, and that's a tradition I am loathe to see undermined."
Wales,2oqjtt,thenorthwinddothblow,-6,Wed Dec 10 00:30:21 2014 UTC,"I'll point out first that I am Welsh but not tied to a party, roughly left/centrist and liberal minded.  I don't think Wales being independent would be a step in the right direction. That's a big one right there. Looks like economic suicide to me. Wales having more powers would be good but I don't think independence is a realistic way of doing that.  As a language Welsh is dying, I personally think it should be left to die as it's doing more harm than good. If Welsh schools focussed on teaching English our pupils wouldn't struggle as much (I have first hand experience of seeing this in education in Wales).  Those are pretty much the issues that are Welsh specific and I'm not exactly towing the Plaid Cymru party line!  The greens are ahead of UKIP in polls and would legislate for the entire UK not just one part, I would love to see them get more influence and they have more of the size and coverage to do so. If I could my vote would definitely go Green over Plaid Cymru.  Unfortunately for me the Green party doesn't have a candidate in my bit of Wales. Conservatives are out straight away for me and after the student loan farce I don't see myself voting Lib Dem even though I class myself as liberal. I guess this leaves me with Plaid Cymru and Labour, it's then a case of picking the better one for the area out of those two.  It's not something I put too much effort into researching though as I plan on being out of Wales for a bit and then making a decision as to whether to come back."
Wales,2oqjtt,Danibaldi,4,Tue Dec 9 20:37:23 2014 UTC,"Firstly, on the independence question, I'd say that independence isn't a priority for Plaid right now. What's most important is fixing the Welsh economy, I'm sure you know that our economy is one of the worst in Europe and we have the highest poverty levels in Northern Europe. We do think that giving the Welsh Government enough economic levers to fix the economy is important, but we're not in the same position as Scotland, certainly. I'd recommend looking up what Leanne Wood has said on the subject, she's very sensible on this subject.   On the language, I have to say that when I read things like that I'm pretty offended. I don't want to guilt-trip you into changing your mind, but I just want you to know that all my family speaks Welsh together, a lot of my friends both at home in Conwy and at university in Cardiff speak Welsh with me. I'm not first language Welsh - I learned it as a second language. But nearly a million people speak it - it's not dying, I promise you.   But anyway, I do understand where you're coming from. But there are indications that children being bilingual is a benefit to them - most countries in Europe have bilingual education, and I don't think people in Wales only being able to speak English is a good idea. If people can speak any language it improves their chances of picking up another one, and considering the Welsh culture is right here in Wales (if you look for it) it's a lot easier to learn than international languages, at any early age.   In my opinion, we shouldn't be ""pushing Welsh down people's throats"", though. We should be giving everybody the opportunity to learn it, for free, but the most important thing we need to do to keep the language going is making the country economically viable. Welsh-speaking communities (almost the entirety of north West Wales) are among the poorest in Europe, and people are having to leave to find jobs - we need to give them the choice of staying in Wales. Oh, and according to a recent poll, over 60% of parents in Wales said they want their children to be taught at least some lessons in Welsh.   Basically - only Plaid Cymru, in my mind, will actually fight for communities and the people of Wales. Completely impartial experts say we're underfunded by Westminster, and that's money that should be going to our schools, hospitals and other public services. Right now, our priority has to be rebalancing the UK's vast wealth so it's more fairly distributed.   But Plaid is about so much more than that - it's also a party that's values go beyond Wales. We want Wales to be a nation on the world stage, and in the EU.

Wales,2oqjtt,thenorthwinddothblow,1 point,Tue Dec 9 22:20:36 2014 UTC,"Yep, I'm in North-East Wales, it's pretty evident how poor it is!  There's not much I can say/do about you being offended, that's your business, however you should know that just because your family continues to speak Welsh does not mean that numbers of Welsh speakers aren't in decline.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language  Definitely less than a million Welsh speakers and dropping. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's a good thing but you have to take the situation as it is.  I'm not saying Welsh shouldn't be an option, it definitely should, but when you have such a bad economy it doesn't help literacy levels to try and teach all kids two languages at the same time. I don't see why it can't be an option like Spanish/German with a proportional amount of welsh medium primary schools. Time that could go towards teaching English/literacy that will be of greater use than Welsh for those without a vested interest in Welsh, it will help the economy more to have people who are better versed in English than Welsh. Also it's a well known problem that there aren't enough Welsh teachers to go around since there are so few that speak it in the first place.  It's worth bearing in mind too that European languages are different to Welsh, English is a Germanic language with a majority of words based on Latin vocabulary. While being bilingual is great for those who can manage it studying European languages complements English to a greater extent than Welsh does and is better from an economic standpoint since you have a greater potential audience to communicate with. Welsh is only used in Wales and Wales is tiny.  From what I've read of Plaid Cymru on other issues I do generally agree with them, I love the millionideas thing and they do seem to be going in the right general direction I just fail to see them ever growing to a point where they'll be able to do much, especially compared to a party that isn't based on one (very small) country. I would love to see an end to two party politics, the way I see that happening is for Labour/Conservatives to shrink and for Green/Lib Dems et.c. to grow."
Wales,2oqjtt,KaiserMacCleg,3,Tue Dec 9 23:28:19 2014 UTC,"but when you have such a bad economy it doesn't help literacy levels to try and teach all kids two languages at the same time.   But where is the evidence that teaching two languages somehow harms literacy? The scientific literature, in fact, seems to point to the exact opposite; that bi- or multilingualism have extensive positive effects on both mind and brain. Here's an early example; a 1962 paper on the relationship between bilingualism and intelligence (the conclusions of which suggested a positive relationship). Here's a much more recent study, which found evidence to suggest that bilingualism helps to protect against cognitive decline in old age. This study suggested that bilinguals have an advantage in learning new languages over monoglots, while this one found that bilinguals performed better in certain cognitive tasks than monolinguals.   The idea that learning Welsh will somehow hold kids back from learning English at the same time is, as far as I can see, a load of old rubbish. I went to a Welsh medium school. I had no trouble in picking up both languages, and my English certainly hasn't suffered on account of my Welsh education.   Remember that multilingualism is the norm, not the exception. Multilingual people outnumber monolinguals worldwide. I'd argue that we should by assigning more time to language classes, not less. I'd like to see kids of primary school age learning a foreign language alongside both Welsh and English."
Wales,2oqjtt,thenorthwinddothblow,0,Wed Dec 10 01:23:06 2014 UTC,"relationship between bilingualism and intelligence (the conclusions of which suggested a positive relationship). Here's a much more recent study[2] , which found evidence to suggest that bilingualism helps to protect against cognitive decline in old age. This study[3] suggested that bilinguals have an advantage in learning new languages over monoglots, while this one[4] found that bilinguals performed better in certain cognitive tasks than monolinguals.   None of those things are proficiency in a main language spoken by lots of people and that's what matters in the real world. I'm not saying bilingualism doesn't have cognitive advantages, it really does. It also has costs too 1, 2. Vocabulary (i.e. words known) of children learning two languages is roughly the same as those learning one language, only since it is across two languages their working vocabulary (if you will) for each is reduced in their language development. By adulthood if both languages are used these differences obviously close. That being said success is measured on English speaking metrics not Welsh speaking ones, employers don't care if you get an A* in Welsh if you fail English. I suspect with your anecdotal example of yourself you were never at risk of not passing English. If I had done Welsh academically I wouldn't have failed it either, I still wouldn't have ever used it. I have anecdotal examples of kids who only passed their English GCSEs by dropping Welsh and devoting that time to more English lessons.  Do you come from a Welsh speaking family? I'm guessing since you got sent to a Welsh medium school you do. Again anecdotal but my friend's girlfriend's kid is struggling in a Welsh medium school because in our bit of Wales nobody speaks it to him outside of that environment. From what I've read it will take a year or two for him to be able to adjust, that's a huge load of school time effectively lost. That has got to affect him.   I'd like to see kids of primary school age learning a foreign language alongside both Welsh and English.   Where are you getting the time and resources for all these things? Have you ever worked in a school? They already have loads to do. Targets to meet. Budgets to keep.  At the end of the day there are only 750,000 Welsh speakers in the world, 600,000 of those are in Wales, less than 20% of the population, only about 16% of the population are fluent and these are heavily dependent on area. It is of virtually no economic advantage to teach it. Wales is falling behind in education and I think that pouring time and money into a sinking ship is pointless. Typically when a second language is used it has usage around the world and is therefore worth the time learning, Spanish for example has over 400 million speakers worldwide, definitely worth learning. If I told people I was going to learn Scottish Gaelic (spoken by less than 1% of Scotland) they'd say why are you bothering to do that? If I told them it was solely to boost my bilingual skills they'd still think it was a really bizarre choice. Yet people defend Welsh vehemently. There is no reason why it shouldn't be completely optional in schools, those who wish to learn it can, those who think their time would be better used elsewhere can do so. Keep Welsh medium schools where there is demand or within a decent range of those who would wish to attend one but I would never send my kid to one."
Wales,2oqjtt,Danibaldi,2,Wed Dec 10 13:14:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't want to say I was offended to convince you to agree with me, it's just hard because people in Wales who don't speak Welsh are so detached from the language and culture (through absolutely no fault of their own). About 600,000 people speak Welsh in Wales, and there's about 150,000 I think in England and a few thousand others dotted across the world. It's nearly 1 million added together, I think.   Yeah, I don't think there is any evidence to suggest that teaching kids 2 languages when they grow up harms their literacy in their first language. And by the way, the Welsh language is probably more of a European language than English. It's similar to French in a lot of ways, just look at the days of the week - Monday, Lundi, Llun. Tuesday, Mardi, Mawrth. Wednesday, Mecredi, Mercher...etc etc.  The important thing about Plaid is to remember that in Westminster elections, we're not going to win a majority. However, in the event of a hung parliament where parties have to do deals with eachother (which is very likely this time) a vote for Plaid will mean that the Westminster parties will actually have to consider Wales for a change - if we do a deal with anyone, it will be on the basis of the redistribution of wealth in the UK - not only to Wales, but Scotland, the North of England, Cornwall etc.   The main reason I would say to vote Plaid in Wales, not Green, is because Plaid can actually win. I love the Greens, but their membership in Wales is tiny, and if we really want to see a progressive, left-wing, sustainable party win, we really need to be clever about where we tick the box."
Wales,2oqjtt,autowikibot,0,Wed Dec 10 09:42:32 2014 UTC,"Welsh language:       Welsh (Cymraeg or y Gymraeg, pronounced [kəmˈrɑːɨɡ, ə ɡəmˈrɑːɨɡ]) is a member of the Brittonic branch of the Celtic languages spoken natively in Wales, by some along the Welsh border in England, and in Y Wladfa (the Welsh colony in Chubut Province, Argentina).  Historically it has also been known in English as ""the British tongue"",  ""Cambrian"",  ""Cambric""  and ""Cymric"".   The 2011 UK Census counted 3.1 million residents of Wales. Of these, 73% (2.2 million) reported having no Welsh language skills. Of the residents of Wales, 25% of the population are not from the country. Of the residents of Wales aged three and over, 19% (562,000) reported being able to speak Welsh, and 77% of these were able to speak, read, and write the language (making 431,000 - 15% of the total population).  This can be compared with the 2001 Census, in which 20.8% of the population (582,000) reported being able to speak Welsh.  In surveys carried out between 2004 and 2006, 57% (315,000) of Welsh speakers described themselves as fluent in the written language.   A greeting in Welsh is one of 55 languages included on the Voyager Golden Record chosen to be representative of Earth in NASA's Voyager program launched in 1977.  The greetings are unique to each language, with the Welsh greeting being Iechyd da i chwi yn awr ac yn oesoedd, which translates into English as ""Good health to you now and forever"".    The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 gave the Welsh language official status in Wales,  making it the only language that is de jure official in any part of the United Kingdom, English being de facto official.  Throughout Wales, roadsigns are bilingual with Welsh and English (e.g. Chepstow is the English name, also given as Cas-gwent which is the Welsh name). The language that appears on the signs first is decided by the local government.

Wales,2oqjtt,thenorthwinddothblow,-4,Thu Dec 11 18:04:44 2014 UTC,"I figured I'd get something like this given it's on /r/Wales. A significant amount of teaching time goes to teaching Welsh when it is not commonly spoken outside of the classroom. The English skills of Welsh students are behind those of their English counterparts and it is affecting the country negatively. That is a fact, being sentimental about the language won't change that fact.  Should we bring back Celtic/Gaelic while we're at it? I don't believe in teaching Welsh any more than I think Celtic/Gaelic should be taught. 1% of Scotland speaks Scottish Gaelic, what number is enough to force it to be taught nationwide?   Many of our European neighbours speak four or five languages and do quite all right ,if not better than us in the UK   Vast majority don't speak that many and those that can are generally able to do so because of the similarity between mainland European languages. Definitely not the case with Welsh. In said countries you can probably expect the vast majority of the country to be fluent too, not less than 20%...  I was also taught Welsh in primary school and I've done fine too. What's your point? It has served absolutely no purpose to me. If I had done it in secondary school it still would have been of absolutely no use to me. What I have seen though is students whose literacy isn't up to scratch yet they are still essentially made to do Welsh classes. Should we mess up children's futures over allegiance to a dying and nearly dead language?"

Wales,2oqjtt,thenorthwinddothblow,1 point,Tue Dec 9 21:45:47 2014 UTC,"In some cases I have genuinely seen kids who have only managed to pass GCSE English by the skin of their teeth by dropping Welsh and having that time replaced by more English/literacy lessons, completely anecdotal of course and it was only a minority of children who had to do this (less than half a dozen in a year) but it was probably their best chance to do so. That being said if this class time went into English/literacy classes lots more pupils could theoretically get better grades in English.  To me it seems obvious that taking time away from English speaking classes will negatively affect literacy, especially so in primary school. It is bound to be confusing for many and in my opinion it's not worth it. I can see the arguments for it and I see why people get defensive about it, I don't bear the Welsh language any ill will but I don't think its benefits justify the class time it gets and rather it was seen as completely optional."

English primaries have been teaching foreign/ancient languages from Sep-14.  In my experience of school, the children who would've failed English literacy would have failed it with or without concurrently studying another language.   I believe that general attitude towards education, combined with much less funding, leads to any disparity between England and Wales."
Wales,2oqjtt,thenorthwinddothblow,-1,Tue Dec 9 22:41:52 2014 UTC,"I guess we'll see with the English schools starting to do that, I imagine though that they'll be teaching European languages that complement English more than Welsh does. Is that mandatory do you know? I know the UK falls behind on foreign language skills but that's almost to be expected when English is probably the most culturally prominent language right now.   In my experience of school, the children who would've failed English literacy would have failed it with or without concurrently studying another language.   Possibly, these kids were obviously not the best students. Most were from poor backgrounds, unfortunately it's a vicious cycle.

Plaid is among the most left-wing parties in Britain. Out of those which stand a chance of getting seats in national elections, I would say they are only exceeded in their socialist tendencies by the Greens. They are certainly to the left of the SNP (though the SNP are also being steered further to the left by their new leader).  Besides, I very much doubt that any of those ""small-c conservatives"" would ever defect to UKIP out of any sort of ideological struggle: UKIP is as close as it gets to the antithesis of Welsh nationalism, be it left-wing or right-wing. A defection to the Conservatives, on the other hand, would be more understandable; after all, the Tories support the principle of devolution and are keen to see further powers devolved in future."

Wales,2nr4ol,ThatVelociraptor,1 point,Sun Nov 30 05:38:56 2014 UTC,"The history between England and Wales within these border areas is very bloody. Actually in general the history between the two countries has always been. For example, the castle was the site of a massacre of Welsh noblemen in 1175, and was attacked during the early 15th century Glyndŵr Rising. William Camden, the 16th century antiquary, said that the castle ""has been oftner stain'd with the infamy of treachery, than any other castle in Wales.""  Abergavenny is lovely though honestly, there's a market weekly.  However personally I'd look for a house in Gilwern. Its close but Golden is also by the canal where boat houses travel regularly.

All of them were just average criminals who got caught around the time that the Police measured their conviction rates ... and all outstanding robberies were just dumped on them, the guys wouldn't stand a chance in court as they were actually guilty of some robberies . So they plead guilty and hope for the best... and the police cleared their books of unsolved robberies.  I'm not saying the Welsh police do this ... but ""one man crimewave"" is often bullshit."

Wales,2mj3rc,eeeRADiCAKE,5,Mon Nov 17 04:25:42 2014 UTC,"1 - What would you like to tell me about Montgomeryshire?   Probably nothing that wikipedia couldn't tell you!   It's close to the border with England so depending on how close your ancestors lived to that border, it's possible they didn't consider themselves Welsh!  It's also in North Wales so it will be hilly, rural, and they will hate everyone from South Wales (plus the English of course).   2 - What are you most proud about being from Wales?    It's going to sound weird but I'm proud of the fact that Welsh people maintain their cultural identity.   This is very different from patriotism in the US, which is very much like ""This is my country, right or wrong"". Wales was conquered by England, reduced to the official status of a principality (i.e. part of a country not a separate country), and the English even tried to ban the Welsh language.  Despite all this Welsh people have retained their own separate identity, their own separate culture and history. People from Wales are proud to be Welsh for a variety of reasons, but they are all Welsh reasons.   3 - What is the most ""Wales specific"" food or dish?   Lava bread  or Welsh Cakes are probably the best ""traditional"" Welsh dishes to try, but no-one really eats lava bread anymore. Cockles are quite popular, as are fish and chips, so is  lamb. There's not a huge amount of unique Welsh dishes.  The recipe for lava bread is basically: Get some lava seaweed, boil it in water for like 4 hours until it's soft. Then you get your seaweed and put it in a pan that is frying some bacon so the seaweed is sort of fried with the bacon fat.   What you end up with is a sort of green slop that actually provides plenty of energy. Miners used to eat it for breakfast (lava bread, bacon, mushrooms).  As for Welsh cakes they are amazing but you need to get a good recipe and practice a lot. My nan makes amazing welsh cakes, I do not.    4 - Is there a movie that really captures the heart and soul of Wales?   Not really, Wales isn't really a country you tend to make movies about, unless it involves swords and dragons and stuff as a lot of King Arthur type legends come from Wales (Merlin's actual name was ""Emrys"", which was Welsh).   5 - Is there a very ""Wales like"" piece of winter clothing (like a specific type of coat or hat) that is common there?   Welsh people are immune to the cold.   There's no specific winter uniform though, walk through Cardiff on a cold winter's day and people will be dressed similarly to you would.  I suppose you could get a scarf with the Welsh rugby logo and stuff on though, that's a pretty Welsh thing to wear.   6 - What else? Tell me things.   Learn to like rugby. Also learn to shout at rugby when it's on the TV.  Even friendly looking old women in Wales will shout bloody murder at the TV when Wales are playing."

To be brutally honest going that far back is largely guesswork unless your ancestors were of noble birth. English and Welsh non-nobles couldn't even read and write back then, so they wouldn't have kept track of people's movements, births, deaths etc.   I have a lot more respect for people who move to another country and feel an affinity with it than people who never go there but claim their ancestors 1,000 years ago was from there. Scottish people have it worse with Americans and others wearing kilts for weddings despite never having been to Scotland.  Your ancestors could be English, they could be Welsh. Best thing to do is visit both and see if you feel an affinity for it all.    2- That's great about keeping your identity. That's one thing about USA it's that the ""melting pot"" has blurred some of our original identities.   That's the thing about the US though, you're a melting pot but that is your identity. Anyone can be an American, because there is this identity that goes beyond race, place of birth etc.  You and your kids would struggle to be seen as Welsh, but me and my kids could easily be seen as American if I lived there long enough.  This isn't a bad thing, Wales and the Europe in general just has a lot more history, and it's not based on taking in others from all other nations.   6 - Its funny. My wife is from Brazil and she is the sweetest little thing until her futbol team comes on & then she screams and curses at the game like a mad woman.

Other films which are Welsh or show life in Wales include Very Annie Mary (2003) I didn't really like it but it's a good portrayal of life in the south Wales Valleys. Human Traffic  (1999) shows Cardiff in the late 90s and is a great film which really catches a moment. The bits of Cardiff shown in the film have not changed too much from when the film was made although Cardiff's skyline and shopping centre has changed, dominated respectively by the Millenium Stadium and the St Davids 2 shopping centre. Mr Nice (2010) is a biopic of legendary former drug dealer and current pro-pot activist and speaker Howard Marks, who grew up near Bridgend in the South Wales valleys during the decline of the mines and went to university before getting mixed up in drugs. It shows community life in South Wales and is another film I'd recommend."

You'll probably burn a few on your first go, but no worries, they're still nice (dip in sugar!)

Wales,2mak73,BluePandaBear,3,Sat Nov 15 09:18:01 2014 UTC,"I just don't think the solution to having bad parties is to give away control to the EU.  If a party other than Labour or Conservative gets big enough, they will be forced to change their policis.  It's happening with UKIP right now, it's eating into the Conservative and Labour vote, so they're changing their stance on the EU and Immigration in response.  The SNP got big enough that they could have a referedum, and now they're predicted to become the biggest party in Scotland.  If Plaid Cymru got big enough in Wales, Labour would have to change it's ways or die out there."

First off - obvious point - you never boo your own players...EVER. Secondly, if a player is off form it's entirely down to the coaches/management to drop him for someone who's in form. There's no way a player will refuse to play for their country because their game isn't as good as it can be. He's become a scapegoat for the armchair experts and day-outters regardless of what the rest of the team is doing. If Hibbard puts in a throw-in which isn't straight, or if Halfpenny misses (one of many) up-and-unders or puts in an aimless kick to the opposition, or if North is defensively out of position and puts us under pressure needlessly...nobody bats an eyelid. Priestland puts one kick straight into touch and every fucker screams to the heavens. It's a load of utter shit. He was solid during the 20m cameo last week with a top territory game.  In addition, everyone's veneration of Hook is utterly misguided. He takes the centres out of the game due to his insistence on doing everything himself in flashy, dazzling solo efforts."

The border between Meirionnydd and Cyfeiliog then is the border between Gwynedd and Powys now. Tegeingl almost exactly corresponds to modern day Flintshire. Modern day Pembrokshire is readily recognisable as the cantrefi of Cemais, Pebidiog, Rhos, Penfro and Daugleddyf (plus little bits of Emlyn and Gwarthaf).  The amount of continuity is surprising."

Even in the North-east, a dim awareness of the old cantrefi remains.

The dipthong ""ae"" in the final syllable is pronounced similar to the English word ""eye"" and not like the ""ay"" in ""bay"". I've rendered that sound as ""ai"" in this explanation - you'll see it pop up again later on.    Sale-waith    The first syllable is pronounced the same as the English words ""sail"" and ""sale"".  The dipthong ""ai"" in the second syllable is, again, pronounced the same as the English ""eye"".    Am-dhif-in    Short ""a"" in the first syllable - as in ""ban"", not ""barn"".  The digraph ""dd"" represents a single sound in Welsh - a voiced ""th"" (""voiced"" meaning that the voicebox must vibrate to produce the sound). It's the ""th"" sound in ""the"" or ""then"" - not the unvoiced ""th"" of ""thing"" or ""thimble"". The double F later on is also a digraph, and represents the sound of the English letter F. Therefore ""ddiff"" is pronounced ""dhif"".  Short ""i"" in the final syllable - as in ""pin""    Man    Man, as in ""man this is hard"".    Huff-ordh-ee    The Welsh letter Y changes in pronounciation depending on its location within a word. Here, it sounds like the English letter U. So Hyff = huff.  Another voiced ""th"" in the next syllable, preceded by a short ""o"" - as in ""orange"", not ""door"".  Long ""i"" in the final syllable, as in ""keen"".    Kair-went    The ""ae"" of ""Caer"" sounds like the English word ""eye"", again. ""Went"" sounds like ""lent"" but with a W in place of an L.  Oh, and every letter R should be pronounced and be trilled / tapped if possible."

None have got off the ground, partially due to environmental concerns, as /u/Cymraeg_Atodeg alludes to (the destruction of intertidal habitats and the endangering of the birds which rely on them, mainly), but mainly because of the vast amounts of capital investment needed to get the project going.   More recently there have been proposals for a tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, which, if you ask me, is far more likely to proceed. If that gets going and proves the technology viable, there's plenty of potential for more lagoons off Cardiff and Newport and in Bridgewater Bay, south across the estuary.  Personally I'd love to see a Barrage across the Severn. Birds be damned - the proposal for a barrage running from Lavernock Point by Penarth to Weston-super-Mare has the potential to generate a whole 5% of the UK's energy needs - or all of Wales' - completely renewably! Not to mention the huge potential for new infrastructure - road and rail links running across the barrage, a new port in the middle of the estuary, investments in Port Talbot's port while it's being constructed etc."
Wales,2j0pgo,KaiserMacCleg,1 point,Sun Oct 12 14:38:15 2014 UTC,"Severn Barrage:       The Severn Barrage refers to a range of ideas for building a barrage from the English coast to the Welsh coast over the Severn tidal estuary. Ideas for damming or barraging the Severn estuary (and Bristol Channel) have existed since the 19th century. The building of such a barrage would be a huge engineering feat, comparable with some of the world's biggest construction projects. The purposes of such a project has typically been one, or several of: transport links, flood protection, harbour creation, or tidal power generation. In recent decades it is the latter that has grown to be the primary focus for barrage ideas, and the others are now seen as useful side-effects. Following the Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study (2008–10), the British government concluded that there was no strategic case for building a barrage but to continue to investigate emerging technologies.

Wales,2il2nq,WobsJack,8,Tue Oct 7 21:34:36 2014 UTC,"Westminster promised Wales bugger all, and it's precisely because of the political mood in Scotland that there's no chance the funding settlement will ever be reformed any time soon.  Scotland does inordinately well out of the Barnett formula. Despite being one of the richer areas of the UK, public spending per head there comes to £10,152, the second highest of any UK nation or region (coming in after Northern Ireland at £10,876). For comparison, the figure is £9,709 in Wales and £8,529 in England.  The Barnett formula is a blunt instrument that doles out money based on population and the level of public spending in England. If that were to be replaced with a needs-based formula, the Scottish Government would see a significant cut in their overall budget, while the Welsh Government would see a more modest increase.   Consequentially, reforming Barnett would be one of the most politically toxic things the government could do vis-à-vis Scotland. Wales has none of the leverage or influence within the UK that Scotland does, and so the calls by government and civil society here for fairness fall on deaf ears."

Based in northwest Wales, the rulers of Gwynedd repeatedly rose to preeminence and were acclaimed as ""King of the Britons"" before losing their power in civil wars or invasions. The unitary kingdom of the usurper Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was shattered by a Saxon invasion in 1063 just prior to the arrival of the Normans, but the traditional dynasty restored by Gruffudd ap Cynan slowly recovered until Llywelyn the Great of Gwynedd was able to proclaim the Principality of Wales at Aberdyfi in 1216.

We always sing Cwm Rhondda, Pen Park, Rachie, Diadem and Dring I Fyny and both the Welsh National Anthem and Star Spangled Banner. The church is divided into four sections for soprano, alto, tenor and bass. The director will even make us stop if a section is off or we aren't singing to their liking.  Each one that I've been to has been a little different depending on the director. We usually have a tea beforehand or after.

Wales,2hq5q8,SirBlah,10,Sun Sep 28 20:37:07 2014 UTC,"I would like to see the UK continue to move towards a true federal system, with the devolved administrations (plus several hypothetical regional assemblies in England) having legislative competence over most policy areas.   In addition to what we have now, that would mean the Welsh Assembly and Government would have control over areas such as:   Energy Policing Broadcasting Infrastructure development Most taxation Most welfare Some macroeconomic powers   Leaving the federal UK government with control over:   Foreign affairs International development Defence Some macroeconomic powers   With monetary policy to remain the remit of the Bank of England.    The West Lothian Question is a serious problem in our democracy (well, oligarchy), and I fundamentally agree that the current arrangement is unfair. However, ""English votes for English laws"" within a UK parliament context is, in my view, unworkable. Barring Welsh, Scottish and NI MPs from voting on certain issues will not so much solve the WLQ so much as reverse it, because of the way that the level of funding for the devolved administrations is determined. The Barnett Formula works out the level of funding based on population and the level of public expenditure in England - if the party of government decides to drive through a program of cuts in England, the budgets of the devolved administrations are also cut. Consequentially, if Welsh, Scottish and NI MPs are barred from voting on particular issues in the HoC, cuts can be forced on the devolved administrations without anyone representing those parts of the UK having any sort of say in the matter whatsoever.  Adittionally, it's easy to imagine a situation where a Labour government has a majority in the HoC but not a majority among English MPs, leaving it unable to influence many of the policy areas it has responsibility for.  The only sustainable way to solve the WLQ is to have a separate parliament for England - or a number of regional assemblies."
Wales,2hq5q8,KaiserMacCleg,1 point,Mon Sep 29 15:43:06 2014 UTC,Hasn't the Assembly already rejected the powers they are offering?
Wales,2hq5q8,ieu99,1 point,Tue Sep 30 07:09:18 2014 UTC,"No. I imagine what you're thinking of is Carwyn Jones refusing income tax powers before the Barnett formula is reformed.  Taxation is a tricky issue for the Labour government in Cardiff. If a portion of the tax take in Wales goes directly to the Welsh Government, that will necessarily result in a reduction in the block grant coming from Westminster. Wales is considerably poorer than the rest of the UK, so you'd be swapping a portion of the block grant, which is a net transfer of funds from central government to Wales, for a much smaller figure coming from direct taxation.   Carwyn Jones is looking for recognition in Westminster that Wales is underfunded in terms of relative need (which is true), and a move to end that underfunding, before he commits to tax raising powers. Oh, and he also wants to put income tax powers to a referendum, because he doesn't really want them in the first place.  It's all a bit ironic; Labour, who have painted themselves as the champions of devolution in Wales, are now the single biggest roadblock to more powers for the Assembly. Even the bleedin' Tories are well ahead of them."
Wales,2hq5q8,KaiserMacCleg,6,Tue Sep 30 09:54:47 2014 UTC,"The assembly is desperate for extra powers, and I hope that they're given them. The Richard Commission recommended more powers back in 2004  http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100410160947/http://www.richardcommission.gov.uk/content/template.asp?ID=/content/finalreport/index-e.asp  As far as the west lothian question goes, should men vote on women's issues, should mps be qualified in economics before voting on financial matters?

Consider this:   The HoL is reformed to introduce democracy into its black and crusty heart. An element of appointed peers remain (perhaps ~30% of the house?). Appointees are chosen by panels of citizens drawn from the population in a similar fashion to juries. Appointees must be unaffiliated with any political party, and experts in a range of policy fields from healthcare to science to environmental management.   The goal being to cut through party politics and the ambitions of career politicians to introduce an element of objectivity and informed opinion to debates on legislation and policy.  Of course such an arrangement would naturally raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest, but if we could find a way around that, then I think we'd be on the right track."

It seems reasonable to suppose that there is a considerable overlap between the sections of the population that would have answered ""yes"" to the Yougov poll and ""more powers"" to this one - i.e. there is a pretty significant group of people whose preference is a stronger Assembly, but would choose independence if that was all that was on offer."

Wales,2gye0z,Misstep_of_Nature,10,Sat Sep 20 15:04:12 2014 UTC,"Here is an email I sent my friend in work. No longer live in Wales but I am back often   Here are a few bits and bobs:  Probably my fav pub in Cardiff is the Goat Major. I really like this pub, its small and run by Brains so normally has some SA or Rev. James on:  http://www.sabrain.com/goatmajor  I normally like to go eat Faggots peas and chips in the market while people watching:  http://www.cardiff-market.co.uk/  Also the Pear tree is a nice place to have a beer, its not in the Centre though, however it is close to Roath park, which is really nice and you can take a boat out on the lake:  http://www.visitcardiff.com/things-to-do/roath-park-and-lake-p9121 http://www.sabrain.com/peartree  If you go down the bay I'd suggest the water taxi trip as it nice to take in the sights. Also I'd go to the welsh cake shop, they are lovely fresh.  http://www.fabulouswelshcakes.co.uk/index.php  I also quite like Penarth, although its been a while since I have been down there. It has a nice pier:  http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/national-trust-special-places-penarth-7567603  Cardiff does have its own museum, its right in the centre but I have not been in a while:  http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cardiff  St Fagans is good and people who come to Cardiff like it. We used to go there a lot for school so I've not been in a while:  http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans  If you go north of Cardiff you can take in Castle Coch an also Caerphilly castle. If you do I'd suggest popping in to Fagin's as thats a really nice pub (although the locals can be a bit clicky). Also really nice for a meal is the Gwaelod (this is where we normally go for special occasions as everyone likes it).  http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186460-d3792608-Reviews-Fagin_s_Ale_Chop_House-Cardiff_Southern_Wales_Wales.html http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/castell-coch/?lang=en http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/caerphilly-castle/?lang=en http://www.gwaelodinn.co.uk/  A bit further out is rest bay which is a nice beach that is normally quieter than Barry/Porthcawl:  http://www.south-wales.org/2009/rest-bay-porthcawl/  I also really like Ogmore the beach is rocky though. The castle has stepping stones across it:  http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/ogmorecastle/?lang=en"
Wales,2gye0z,BigHowski,2,Sat Sep 20 16:06:34 2014 UTC,Great list!  Just to add to the Ogmore recommendation. The Pelican is a great food-serving pub. there's also The watermill which does good food at good prices. You would pass both on your way to Ogmore. The Pelican is opposite Ogmore castle. Next to it is a horse riding school which does treks down to the beach along the river. Treks start from £25.   Southerndown is the next beach over to the East of Ogmore which is my personal favourite of the two. There's a nice walk around the old castle gardens and up the the top of the hill.  I think a car would be the essential way to visit this far out from Cardiff but there is public transport. If you decide to go and need more info. Let me know.  Also ST Fagans; you can get a bus there from Cardiff and it's free to get in.

I will have to admit my arrogance with disabled access sorry, but I will say that most trains and busses seems to have access so I think you will still be able to get around.   Caerphilly is easy to get to via trains or buses (take the train) but a word of warning they are crap on a Sunday (it's the reason I own a car). The castle is right in the heart of Caerphilly so it is not that hard to get to. It is about 5 mins walk for an able person, but there are busses that go there as long as you don't mind hopping on for 2 stops.   St Fagans contains a bit of walking from what I remember, but double check as it's been a few years since I have been there.   If your stuck for things don't ignore Swansea as it's very easy to get to via train and as much as I should not love it I really like the place (apart from on a Saturday night!)."

Maybe if they made an Owain Glyndwr 'FREEEEEDOM' movie maybe it would spur Wales on to want independence.  As a proud Welshman, YES. But as a realist I think it would be misguided as a few have said, we get a whole lot more from England than we generate.  I just hate the English arrogance that we even dare to have ideas of grandeur that don't involve them and create fear mongering propaganda that they are they only option."

Wales,2gjm16,Viking18,4,Tue Sep 16 10:00:32 2014 UTC,If we could just resurrect Brunel to build a tunnel under the Brecon Beacons that'd be lovely.
Wales,2gjm16,LE4d,2,Tue Sep 16 11:41:56 2014 UTC,"That would be a good scheme to have completed, currently the better rail links in Wales are the East - West ones."
Wales,2gjm16,crucible,3,Tue Sep 16 18:26:58 2014 UTC,"This is a key point for me - how can Wales become truly independent if the main North-South rail link goes through England, and the major North-South road links are pretty poor? I'm thinking of the A470, A483, A487 as examples. One of them should really be dual carriageway throughout like this.  It would need a major investment in infrastructure to correct all of this."
Wales,2gjm16,crucible,2,Tue Sep 16 23:23:27 2014 UTC,"tbh, a dual carriageway won't really cut it if it's only one; a motorway would be needed - dual carriageway won't be able to cope too well if there's needed lane closures.  Rail would be better, but it'd need to be something pretty damn serious, and preferably on the same gauge as the rest of the continent - cheaper to source better parts, faster, more efficient, more reliable, etc. Get that in place, run it, say, Pembroke - Newport - Chester - Bangor - Pembroke, and you've got something that could likely compete or exceed the english transport routes - Important thing to remember about continental style rail systems is they can transport more cargo, meaning there's a greater potential for profit."

Good point, and one which I hadn't considered fully. The A55 across North Wales is mostly dual carriageway and its often beset by delays if one lane needs to be closed because of roadworks or an accident.  Of course a lot of the M4 across South Wales only has two lanes on each carriageway - from the end of the motorway near Pont Abraham Services, most of the section from Swansea to Cardiff, the elevated section past Port Talbot, the Brynglas Tunnels near Newport etc.   Rail would be better, but it'd need to be something pretty damn serious, and preferably on the same gauge as the rest of the continent - cheaper to source better parts, faster, more efficient, more reliable, etc. Get that in place, run it, say, Pembroke - Newport - Chester - Bangor - Pembroke, and you've got something that could likely compete or exceed the english transport routes   Yes, if we were building a new railway it would be to the common European standards - the only difference to the existing railways would be a bigger loading gauge. Hopefully that would get cargo off the roads too, you could just have smaller vans for local deliveries at the end of the railway line, things like that. Or put the lorries on the train for most of the journey.  Personally I would say start any new line at Pembroke Dock  and then follow the existing South Wales Main Line past Carmarthen, Swansea and Cardiff to Newport but then make sure you build it up inside Wales so go through places like Abergavenny, Builth Wells, Newtown, and Welshpool.   Between Welshpool and Wrexham you would have to follow the border, from Wrexham you could go through Chester but that line is going outside of Wales. Not sure what you do then unless you build a new line to Shotton or massively upgrade my local line, maybe going through Chester is a better idea after all!  Question is with that route you are passing a lot of towns and cities, do you stop the trains in all of them in which case you only need trains with a top speed of around 100mph but good acceleration / deceleration capability.  Or build alongside existing lines to keep serving the local traffic, only serve the larger communities with the new line and go for something with a higher top speed. !50mph would be enough really. Cardiff to Holyhead by road is only 197 miles, if you used the fastest trains that can reach 190, 200 mph or so would they get up to a decent speed before having to slow down again for the next stop?  Honestly this is all a pipe dream at the moment, I will just be happy when the railway lines in South Wales are electrified by the end of the decade."

Wales,2gjm16,buckley118,14,Wed Sep 17 02:16:23 2014 UTC,"I have a few issues with the argument that we shouldn't be independent because we get from the union more than we get into it (in terms of public spending).  Firstly, Wales does not have a lack of resources or economic advantages at all; we actually have a wide variety of factors in our favour like tourism, green energy (as has been pointed out on a number of occasions), high proximity to a worldwide financial hub (London), agriculture, etc etc. We don't have Scotland's oil, but most countries don't. We actually have more natural resources than Ireland but are nowhere near their GDP or average wage, for example.   I think that this is because we have a national infrastructure that is, quite frankly, appalling.  Wales doesn't have electrified rail yet, the only country in Europe besides Albania and Moldova that can say this. Being able to travel from the south of the country to the north is difficult (even on the train we have to go through England 90% of the time). To get from Aberystwyth to Carmarthen on the train, you have to go through England.  We have a pathetic media. We have genuine national concerns - how is our health service being run? Are we educating our children well? Why is our language declining? Is our government performing well? But these questions aren't scrutinised by a national media. The BBC gives us the same news coverage as a region of England with none of these concerns and British newspapers don't have a Welsh version, like they do in Scotland.  The average wage in our country is very, very low, and the number of people on benefits is high. This is by no means our fault, it's a sign of the failure of the governments we've had to make Wales a good place to invest. These facts also make Wales a relatively cheap place to live and this attracts pensioners and more people on benefits - not exactly going to improve our GDP per capita, is it? I want to reiterate though that I have no problem with people on benefits - they have been failed by the government.   In many ways, Wales doesn't look like a country. Scotland is independent in a lot of ways that Wales isn't anyway, no matter the result of the referendum, and they have been able to build something that resembles a national infrastructure even without political independence.   Wales, as I see it, has two choices. We can continue to be a part of the UK and take the relatively comfortable existence that comes with that. Yeah, we're consistently the poorest region of the UK (and even at times the EU) but we're actually getting back more than we put in. If London creates wealth, it does sometimes trickle back down to us. When they make a loss, it's normally us who actually pays for it in the form of austerity (because we are a dependent nation), but we still get more than we give. We can either settle for that, or we can go independent. It'll take a lot of effort, and it won't be easy, but we would be able to instigate truly national policies that increase investment in Wales and creates more jobs. As probably the most famous living economist, Joseph Stiglitz, says - it's not the size of a country or even its resources that makes the difference, its their economic policies.  Wales has a decision to make."
Wales,2gjm16,Danibaldi,2,Tue Sep 16 11:10:41 2014 UTC,"It is a strange situation to be in. On one hand, we do not have the economy to become independent and on the other we have near to no control over big investments in infrastructure or national economic policy which keeps us at the level we are.  I hope nation builders start coming into power in our government; it'll be interesting to see if there is any kind of shift towards this at the Welsh government's next election after the Scottish events. If anything, I hope people become better versed in what devolution truly means for us, and how we can make it truly work in the country's interests."

I think I outline what I think pretty well there. Basically, we can stay in the UK and accept that we're always going to be an outlying, dependent 'region', or we can go for independence and build our nation and make it compete with other nations of a similar size (who happen to be among the richest in the world)."

Look around and see just how many things in Wales have a plaque or sign on/near them declaring they were funded by the EU.  I know our tax money is going towards it, but Westminster aren't spending much money on anywhere in England other than London (apart from billions to shave half an hour off of bankers from Manchesters daily commute...... to London), let alone Wales."
Wales,2gjm16,KaiserMacCleg,3,Tue Sep 16 10:09:13 2014 UTC,"West Wales and the Valleys have, in theory at least, benefited from a cumulative £3.35 billion in EU convergence funding, that much is true (in practice the government have tended to squander this funding on third sector crap instead of investing in infrastructure development or anything really useful).  However, Wales receives a net transfer of funds every year from central government which, cumulatively speaking, far exceeds anything we've received from the EU. It is still not correct to characterise this as England subsidising Wales, however. It is true that the Welsh public deficit is larger than the UK average, but as with the UK's own deficit, the gap between revenues and expenditure is largely filled by borrowing."

There's always lots to do there especially in the summer. Also try and stop by the Gower, Britain's first ""Area of outstanding natural beauty"".  As for cost of living, I can't really help you with that. There are plenty of high quality-low cost campsites around the coastal areas of Wales if you don't mind roughing it a bit.

Wales,2fufc3,Marowak,3,Mon Sep 8 21:33:01 2014 UTC,"I'm having trouble writing a reply that isn't an absurdly long list, so I'll just restrict myself to a few locations that I doubt you'll find in the guide books.  Tre'r Ceiri (Town of the Giants) on the Llŷn Peninsula, in Gwynedd, NW Wales, is an spectacular and fantastically well-preserved Iron Age hillfort with commanding views over the peninsula that really should get more attention than it does. It's located on a subsidiary summit of Yr Eifl (The Trident), a mountain on the north coast, so it requires a bit of a hike to reach. Unusually for hillforts, there is more than just earthworks left to see - hut circles can still be picked out between the vegetation, and an imposing encircling wall - which still reaches 4 m in places - surrounds the site. The whole place was built in the same way as the dry stone walls which criss-cross most of rural Wales. On a clear day you'll be rewarded for your efforts with fantastic views over the peninsula, Snowdonia, Anglesey and Cardigan Bay.   Bryn Celli Ddu (Mound in the Black Grove) and Barclodiad y Gawres (Apronful of the Giantess) are neolithic passage tombs on the Isle of Anglesey in NW Wales. They are fantastically well preserved and really worth a look. Barclodiad y Gawres is right on the coast, so I assume the coast path runs right past it.   Aber Falls near Bangor, again in NW Wales (and I'm not even from that part of the country!) is an impressive waterfall in a secluded valley in the Carneddau mountain range, not far from the eponymous village of Abergwyngregyn on the coast. It's a short, relaxing walk up to the falls themselves.  I can definitely send that absurdly long list your way though, if you think it would help!"
Wales,2fufc3,Jones-1,2,Mon Sep 8 23:05:17 2014 UTC,"So what you're saying is that Gwynedd is--more or less in its entirety--a cultured and beauty-laden locale? I should expect nothing less!

Wales,2fr8im,Raregan,11,Sun Sep 7 22:36:42 2014 UTC,"I think it will be a good thing in the long-term. The British state needs a shake-up and kick up the arse. For too long parts of the UK have been marginalised to the benefit of London and the South-East. Westminster have failed to recognise the growing discontent outside the M25 and I don't buy into this sudden 'shock' swing towards Yes in Scotland. This has been a long time coming and it speaks volumes about the sheer incompetence of Westminster that they have failed to put Devo-max or viable Regional parliaments with real powers on the table. Not putting Devo-max in the Scottish referendum has proven to be a massive mistake.   Undoubtedly Scottish independence will be painful for Wales in the short-term. 92% of Westminster will consist of English MPs. However, I think this will force the assembly to demand a gradual transfer of power to Cardiff where they can begin to tackle the massive infrastructural problems among others. I study in London and it is just depressing going back to North Wales to visit family. Wales doesn't even have a North-South railway for god's sake. I can't help but think that we have been treated unfairly.  I think a gradual approach to independence with Wales being able to tackle our own economic problems in our own best interests would be ideal.  I know many will disagree with me and I'm happy to discuss other opinions but Scottish independence might finally make Westminster realise that there is a lot more to the UK than just London.   If countries like Latvia and Lithuania are independent are don't see why Scotland, and in turn Wales, can't be independent when we have more to offer. Wales needs some self-belief. I think Scotland will do brilliantly as an independent country and it is about time that Wales starts to have a healthy debate about what we need to do next."
Wales,2fr8im,WobsJack,4,Mon Sep 8 08:58:58 2014 UTC,"Agreed entirely. And do add to that with a hint of bitterness and political bias on my behalf, if independence means getting away from a political scene where the far right parties like UKIP are growing in popularity then I hope they get as far away from us as they possibly can. Good luck to them I say."

The fact is we are better as a whole than we are in parts and that goes across the whole of the nations making up the United Kingdom.   As far as the flag goes I don't care too much..... Again it's historic why there is no representations of the Welsh in the flag, it our flag now with lots of meaning across the nation."
Wales,2fr8im,BigHowski,4,Sun Sep 7 23:05:39 2014 UTC,"History is in the past bumping your gums about it does not to change it   Good thing this referendum isn't about the past, then. It's about the future - what sort of country the people of Scotland want to be a part of going forward. The dominant narratives coming from those in favour of independence have certainly not been about Braveheart, bagpipes and Bannockburn - they've been about inequality, social justice and democracy. If you doubt that, start following the debate for yourself. I recommend you start here."
Wales,2fr8im,KaiserMacCleg,0,Mon Sep 8 11:47:01 2014 UTC,"But they are not, or at least so close as to not matter. I have a feeling that most people voting yes its more about Scotland being seen to be set apart from the English and getting back what they have lost by being part of the union.  Lets take the 10 reasons provided here (which admittedly the first google result with a list).   Taking Responsibility by moving all Governing Powers to Scotland Get the Government we choose No more building Nuclear Weapons Securing Oil Funds in North Sea Scotland has the resources and finances Believing in the creation of more jobs Believing in the benefits for Scotland and yourself as individual Believing in a more equal wages Believing that Scotland and England have opposite Political and Social views Understanding that NO may lead to changes for worse   I'll ignore point 10 and 8, as lets be honest its not a real point.   1, 2, 3 and 9 are actually the same point really which is that there is an ideology gap between the English government  lead by the Tories and the more left leaning Scottish heartlands. Fair enough, and probably true but being part of a democracy means that you have to take the rough with the smooth.  I don't see this as a valid reason to leave, just like (for the large part) Wales is more left leaning than England.  Would you leave Europe because they don't have the same ideology too? At the end of the day every single democracy is a mash of differing view points. Scotland has devolved power and gets to chose its own government.  Again 4, 5, 6. Well this is the big bone of contention I suppose. I feel that the Yes campaign is putting all its eggs in one basket with the oil. Yes it brings in lots of money but relying on it is short termism, I've not see any plans to make oil for for you like Norway. What else have Scotland got? Tourism and export of whiskey I can't see many other big employers.   8: Wages are not alone an indication of wealth, yes the average Scottish wage is a lot less than London but then where else is not really. Wages in Aberdeen are pretty high, but then so are all the costs of there. I don't have any figures but my guess is there is not a huge difference in wages.  7: I don't see a vast number of benefits and see quite a few dangers. The argument has been ill defined on both sides"

Wales,2f6gh2,Vrykyl_Nex,14,Mon Sep 1 16:27:57 2014 UTC,"Total government spending for Wales is 30 billion pounds a year and tax receipts come to 17 billion pounds. This is an issue which needs to be improved before any independence referendum comes.   I noticed shale gas was mentioned in one of your links but that would mean fracking one of the most populous parts of the country. An area with a very high unemployment problem.   In Swansea there is also the issue of the DVLA being one of the biggest employers.   In Wrecsam, Flintshire and a few other areas you have the problem where a large percentage of the problem work across the border in English cities.  Other issues I see are the North/South divide; the roads are rubbish and by rail you have to cross the border into England in order to get from Swansea/Cardiff/Newport to Aberystwyth/Wrecsam/Rhyl/Caernarfon.   Finally of course there is the currency issue. I've seen some say that the pound is valued too highly for Wales which is probably true if an independent Wales is to have an export based economy. This creates a problem as most people are against changing the money, and if it was to be changed what would be changed to?"
Wales,2f6gh2,Fyenwyw,2,Mon Sep 1 17:31:03 2014 UTC,"Those a very good points, ones that I hope I can deal with here.   Current UK spending for the fiscal year of 2013/14 is 720 Billion in expenses, with only £612 Billion in tax receipts. That's a huge gap, and shows a huge amount of borrowing - almost £108 Billion of it.   http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/20/budget-2013-tax-spending-visualised#zoomed-picture  The borrowing alone is over 3x the size of the Welsh economy. So, an independent Wales can meet the expenditure with borrowing, like every other country on earth does.   Though, you also have to look at what the expenditure is used on. As it shows in the links: £4.7 billion is the welsh contribution to the new trident program. As an independent nation, we wouldn't have need of that. Wales also spends £1.9 Billion a year on the UK's military - we wouldn't have to spend any where near that. The Rep. of Ireland has an established military, that more than meets an acceptable quality and only spends 500M euro on it. An independent Wales would only need to spend no more than 300M on it, and we have over 1,000km of relatively untapped power, and with the second highest tidal range in the world, the potential for energy generation is massive, and an economy where 15% of the GDP accounts for manufacturing. This all can be grown and invested in.   An alternative to the shale could be coal - about a trillion tonns of it is estimated to be underground off of the cost of South Wales. While not very green, there are many green solutions and alternatives to shale and coal aswell. Wales produces the majority of the UK's green energy through wind and tidal power, and with the Welsh population considerably less than England's, at 3.1 million compared to the English population of 53.06 million, Wales should more than be able to cover the power needs of an independent Wales, with any over being sold to England. These areas could be expanded upon and invested in massively.  The issue of the North/South divide is a big one, but that merely requires investment from the Welsh government - something we could solve more efficiently in an independent Wales.  The issue of a large percentage of population in areas of the Wales working in England could be solved easily by an agreement being worked into independence where they are issued with automatic work vissas if they work in England, Scotland or N.Ireland, and the fact that people work for the DVLA isn't a problem - they'll still have their jobs if Wales was to be independant.  Wales could also join a currency union with the rest of the UK - much like Scotland plans to do if the Yes campaign win the referendum - which I think they have a high chance of doing."
Wales,2f6gh2,Fyenwyw,6,Mon Sep 1 18:16:58 2014 UTC,Still the percentage difference in tax expenses and receipts for the UK is much better than the current situation in Wales. Even if you do adjust it for reduced military spending.    The North South divide I feel requires more than just saying investment as you still have 100 miles of mountains and not much else between the major population centres in North and South Wales.   the fact that people work for the DVLA isn't a problem - they'll still have their jobs if Wales was to be independant.   Will they? The DVLA office serves the entire United Kingdom right now where as if Wales went independent a large number of those jobs would be moved to England.

That is true I suppose, they will be moved to England. Some jobs will be lost in the process. But, I think that more jobs will also be created through the process. As there'll surely be the creation of a Welsh DVLA.   Still the percentage difference in tax expenses and receipts for the UK >is much better than the current situation in Wales.   What I am saying is that it CAN be dealt with through borrowing, and that there CAN be cuts in things that are not in the interest of Wales, like the £4.7 Billion spent on the new Trident program. There'll also be increased investment and growth in sectors that are important to Wales, which will provide more jobs. There are options, and options are what Wales needs.   The North South divide I feel requires more than just saying >investment as you still have 100 miles of mountains and not much else >between the major population centres in North and South Wales.

Rossett is just over a mile from the border with England. So about 4.5 miles of that scheme and probably a good £34 million of the cost is actually being invested in England.  Meanwhile people in the area are travelling from Wrexham and Flintshire to the Wirral, Merseyside, Liverpool and Manchester. Hourly trains to Cardiff will only benefit the Shotton - Chester - Crewe section of the line, most people use the ""premier service"" as a glorified commuter train between these locations now anyway."
Wales,2f6gh2,Viking18,9,Mon Sep 1 19:25:04 2014 UTC,"There is no reason why Wales, even as it is today, couldn't be a viable independent sovereign state.  That said, I don't think the question you ask in the title is the really important one. The question I would ask is ""Should Wales be an independent nation?"". My answer would still be yes, but it would be a more tentative yes, with qualifications.   The point that /u/Fyenwyw raises with regards to Wales' budget deficit is a good one. A critical difference between Wales and Scotland is that Wales is unquestionably a net recipient of funds from central government. Scotland is (barely) a net contributor. Per capita, the tax take in Wales is less than any other constituent part of the UK - a consequence of Wales' relative poverty - and that poses a real problem with independence. On independence day, the Welsh Government would have to be looking at spending cuts, tax rises and a painful amount of borrowing in order to balance the books.  And yet, I still contend that independence, in the long term, would be best for Wales. Why? How we got where we are now. Ed Miliband's ""redistributive union"" - that is, the United Kingdom - has failed Wales. It has failed to secure economic prosperity or social justice. GVA per capita (a crude measure of productivity, but it's all we have) has been declining relative to the UK average since 1987. The reasons behind the decline are many, but part of the picture is absolutely the overly centralised state of which we are a part and its almost total disinterest in Wales. It has endowed us with a lack of investment in infrastructure, a currency which makes exporting difficult and an inflexible tax code that doesn't allow for regional variation to offset economic imbalances. It's relentless focus on promoting the economy of London and the South-east has produced an environment where the median wage in Wales is £11,056 lower than in London, according to ONS figures, leading to an inevitable brain drain which only makes the problem worse.   Independence presents a real opportunity to turn our ailing fortunes around. I would advocate a more gradual path than the one taken in Scotland, though. Increasing taxation and borrowing powers to the Welsh Government should allow them to tackle the infrastructure problem head on (or it would if the government down the Bay wasn't so fucking useless), so the government's response to the recent Silk Commission is at least partly positive."

You've got decent East - West lines in the south, and to a lesser extent to the north, but there's nothing going north-south.  We'd need a N-S link if we were to become independent. We're not going to get a N-S link because we're incapeable of funding it on our own, and it's more efficient to go through England."

Everyone has a different opinion, some people say we can afford to go independent and others say we can't but there doesn't seem to be a diffinitive answer. I can see it from both sides really, I would love to see an independent Wales, I'm proud to be welsh and want my country to get the recognition it deserves.  That being said, from what I understand, Wales has had pretty much all of its natural resources ripped out, coal, slate, water, land, gold and that's just off the top of my head. Supply and demand, we have nothing to supply that others want, the scots have the oil up there, we all know how much that's in demand.

Wales has plenty of the above resources, as do many places in the UK. It's just not really economical to extract them. Why would a Company pay Welsh workers to dig coal out of the ground when they could get ten times as much for half the price shipped in from overseas?  There's a reason Thatcher shut down the mines. Arguably if the unions had been willing to modernise and accept heavy job losses we (the former industrial regions of Britain) could have been left with some form of low labour intensive, high tech industry but alas it was not so."

A little further out, buy very accessible is the Bassaleg area, which is considered more 'posh' than most of Newport. Other more upmarket areas include Ridgeway.  The office for national statistics is also a stonesthrow away from the Motorway Junction, so commuting from Cardiff would not be out of the question.  It depends a lot on your budget, but also if you can drive and such.

Historically, though, it must have been an important place to the local inhabitants, because there's just so much history lying about the place. There's a ruined twelfth century chapel. There's the ruins of a walled village that was occupied from the Iron Age right through the Roman period and into the Dark Ages. There's even a Neolithic burial chamber that's over four thousand years old just lying next to the road. To put that in context, that burial chamber predates not only the US, but the Roman Empire, the Persian Empire, the Qin Dynasty of China and the New Kingdom of Egypt. It's very old indeed.

So I won't be answering too much about the economical realities, but tax is here and going to get more significant, and questions are being asked discretely as to how to solve economical situations. The favorite idea is to appeal to very wealthy people from outside, and foreign companies are now able to come in. Until 4 or so years ago, that was impossible, becasue an andorran had to have the majority shares in any company. this served people who wanted to come here with lots of cash and not really put their name forward as visible. Now that has become complicated. The response to the offer of wealthy people being able to give the government a deposit of (I think) 250.000 euros (returned on leaving, no interest obviously) and make a minimum property investment of 400.000 in exchange for residency (non working) is inconclusive."

In the 19th and early 20th century the Argentine government encouraged immigration from Europe to populate the country outside the Buenos Aires region; between 1856 and 1875 thirty-four settlements of immigrants of various nationalities were established in Santa Fe and Entre Ríos. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe by 44 Welsh people who left Chubut, and another group settled at Coronel Suárez in southern Buenos Aires Province.  In the early 21st century around 50,000 Patagonians were of Welsh descent.  The Welsh-Argentine community is centred on Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin.  Chubut estimates the number of Patagonian Welsh speakers to be about 1,500, while other estimates put the number at 5,000.

Wales,2ebjcz,BigHowski,4,Sat Aug 23 14:46:18 2014 UTC,"First off sorry for the lack of links but I am on a mobile. edit: now with links  I think finding a job will be the hardest part and that will dictate everything else. I am pretty specialised in my skill set so I can't help you with general job info too much.  Reed,  monster and indeed seem to be highly recommended job sites. The local rags I know of are Wales online, which also has a job section.   Personally I'd suggest you look at areas such as Cardiff, Swansea or at a push Newport. The reason being that they have great links to places like London, which I guess will be on your list of places to see. Houses are cheaper up the valleys but public transport can really suck, esp on a Sunday. Websites such as zoopla and rightmove will give you an idea of rent and cost. You do get less for your money from what I understand of the US house market.   Not sure about if you have your driving licence but I hear that car insurance is more expensive (compared to Hungary at least!). Traffic along the m4 can be bad. Fuel prices are also much worse so try not to have a large commute. Train/bus tickets are not much better unless you book well in advance and travel outside of peak times.   Oh work wise from talks with us coworkers you will have a lot more holiday and a lot more rights once you pass 6 months and generally less hours."

Wales,2ebjcz,Timmeh7,1 point,Sat Aug 23 14:38:36 2014 UTC,"Not so sure about a driving license. Most of the people I know who moved across were students so funding a car was not really on the cards.  Getting a job might be difficult.....  Sad to say. To better my career I moved away but that's me in my field,  don't let it put you off. What type of jobs are you looking for?   I will probably get down votes for this but Cardiff is by far my favourite place in the UK. I am however biased as it's where both sides of my family are from. I like the area around Roath Park if your looking for accommodation, however it's far from the cheapest area of Cardiff."

Wales,2ebjcz,Puddleduck97,3,Sat Aug 23 20:18:45 2014 UTC,"I'm an academic in a Welsh university, so I know the immigration and visas procedure in more detail than anyone probably should.  Firstly be under no illusion that it's anything but difficult to move here long-term.  It's not the case that you can move here and hope to get a job later - you need to be employed, and that employer needs to be willing to sponsor you.  There are a few paths to this - the most robust is to be a skilled worker in a profession in-demand in the UK (see this list for details of what that entails), or if you work for a company in the US who want you to work in their UK branch.  There are a few additional edge cases like professional sportspeople which probably won't apply here.  I do note on that list that psychiatry is mentioned, though it appears to suggest they're looking for NHS medical doctors.  The more likely path is to get a job with a British organisation capable of sponsoring visas, and to enter on a Tier 2 (general) visa.  That job must pay at least £20,500 to be eligible.  In theory, this isn't too difficult; you can apply for a job, be made an offer, and sort the visa that way.  The problem, however, is when you ask the question why an organisation will go through the paperwork hassle; unless you have a specific skill that they need, or you REALLY impress them in some other way, chances are they're going to take an applicant from the EEA who doesn't involve that hassle.  That's not to say you shouldn't try, but be aware that it won't be an easy path to walk.  There are other types of visas, of course; the easiest would be ancestry.  I don't suppose any of your grandparents hold, or held British citizenship?  The details pertaining to this visa state that that grandparent needs to have been born in the UK, but in most cases simply holding British citizenship can be sufficient.  Failing that, you're looking at either a student visa (which can be very expensive as you don't get government support with university fees - generally a bursary required to make it viable unless you're obscenely wealthy), or marriage.  I'm definitely not saying it's impossible, indeed it certainly isn't; I've known several people in what I feel were weaker positions than you who successfully made it in.  Just be aware that it's not something that'll happen on a whim; it'll require effort and persistence, and even then there are no absolutes.  Good luck - feel free to direct any questions my way, if you have any."
Wales,2ebjcz,BigHowski,2,Sat Aug 23 21:05:15 2014 UTC,"This is extremely helpful, thank you. I'll check out the links and get back to you =)  I know it's not going to be easy, but most good things aren't. I'm wondering if I should come in on a student visa (finishing up my masters there) and apply for jobs while I'm in the area. I feel awkward enough trying to talk myself up during interviews, I can't imagine trying to convince the company to sponsor me as well... I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get to it."
Wales,2ebjcz,ItsJustBeenRevoked2,2,Sat Aug 23 22:19:49 2014 UTC,"Not a bad idea.  If nothing else, it'll let you check out the area (don't know how much you've visited?), and see what an area's like over a prolonged period.  Quite a few of our international students have studied master's degrees, moved on to PhDs, and found work in the UK based on their doctoral studies.    Of course, funding is the big question there, but you can work on a student visa (some restrictions) if you're willing to work and study simultaneously."
Wales,2ebjcz,Timmeh7,2,Sat Aug 23 23:19:30 2014 UTC,"Haven't visited at all yet, actually. Hoping to go sometime soon. Life kept getting on the way, so I haven't had time for a real vacation. I'll start looking into university and student visa costs. Hopefully the student visas take less time than the others, I don't want to delay my degree any longer than I have to. Oh god... I'd have to redo all my student loan stuff too I think. I don't think the US government will pay for an overseas education...   Oh! I looked at the list of jobs needed. Social work sounds like it could be doable. I was a bit confused by the description though. It mentioned band 5, 6, etc..? The internet says it has something to do with paygrades (which was obvious on the job page anyway) but what is it based on? Experience or..?"
Wales,2ebjcz,GraceDoran,2,Sun Aug 24 01:20:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah, experience and education would dictate the band you start on - it's all on the NHS unified pay spine.  Not sure if you're familiar with pay spines like this - each ""point"" on the spine is a yearly increment, but moving between bands requires a promotion (usually following an interview process), entailing taking on additional responsibilities consummate with that band, possibly including leadership.  You don't need to be at the top of your current band to be promoted to a different band by any means.  Band 5 is entry level for social work, but as you're not too far from a master's degree it's possible you'd start on band 6."
Wales,2ebjcz,GraceDoran,2,Sun Aug 24 01:39:52 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry if this sounds silly, but that doesn't even sound like real life haha I don't think we have anything like that at all here. Here you have an extremely awkward (and sometimes snobby) conversation during your interview where you basically have to barter your starting salary. At some random point you might get a promotion (read: title change and more responsibility) and if you're lucky you might get a small raise. Moving sounds like a better and better option everyday."
Wales,2ebjcz,batesmotel93,2,Sun Aug 24 01:44:15 2014 UTC,"That does sound like hell, and I assume probably results in some rather unfair pay rates to those who don't negotiate well.  I guess there's also no account made for inflation?  Spines scale pay rates (such as in this example used by universities) upwards to slightly exceed the increase of cost of living; without doing that, every year you surely take a de facto pay cut proportional to the rate of inflation.  Pay spines are fairly common here, especially in large organisations; the university I work for also uses one, with all staff on the same unified structure.  It's a good system, and trends mostly towards being meritorious; people often try to take on a few of the responsibilities of the band above them to demonstrate that their ability is becoming consummate with a higher band, which makes them a stronger candidate for promotion later.  I'm interested, if you don't mind me asking; given that you've not yet visited, what drew you to Wales?"
Wales,2ebjcz,batesmotel93,2,Sun Aug 24 11:00:28 2014 UTC,"Pop culture did, actually. I'm much more fond of tv shows that were/are produced in the UK. As with most interests, if you like it enough you want to know more. That's what happened with me. I started looking into the lifestyle, politics, and overall general attitudes of the area and grew to like it even more. Wales specifically.   At first, I was content to just be fond of the country, but the more things I learned, the more upset I was by the drastic difference. There are ideas and policies already being used to their full potential in Wales that people are just sitting around and arguing about here. People will call me idealistic and tell me that the world will beat it out of me soon even though I can point to countries that are already doing such amazing things. No, I can't sit around here and wait for everyone to catch up to the 21st century haha."

That's interesting, I'd be keen to know specifics (if only for my own curiosity).  Personally I was born here, and moved away for a time, but got drawn back within a few years.  I'm not inherently patriotic, but living elsewhere galvanized in my mind the extent to which, as a liberal person, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else."

Llys Y Fran was harder than I thought it was going to be.

I don't think there's a huge selection of these available but there are definitely a few. Un Nos Ola Leuad by Caradog Prichard springs to mind. It's a bit heavy/depressing and maybe difficult if you've been learning a more southern dialect, but it's a good novel.   Also have a look at some of Bethan Gwanas' novels. Again, they're mostly in north Walian dialect, but they're good and she's written a few aimed specifically at adult Welsh learners.  I personally like Dan Gadarn Goncrit by Mihangel Morgan, but it's quite  a weird novel so depends a lot on your taste!

Wales,2dnxni,Awkward_moments,10,Fri Aug 15 20:11:45 2014 UTC,"Yes, that's true.  ""Prince"" comes from the Latin princeps, meaning ""the first man"". It was a title that was used extensively in the Roman Empire, and was one of the many titles used by the emperors themselves. Compare the modern title Prime Minister, meaning first minister.  The Welsh tywysog literally means ""leader"", from the verb tywys ""to lead"".   The adoption of the title Prince / Tywysog by certain native rulers of Wales in the Middle Ages did not reflect a reduction in status but an elevation; Wales was glutted with kings at the time, so much so that the title had become devalued. The use of the title ""prince"" was an attempt to set themselves apart from the other native Welsh rulers and establish their claims to overlordship over all (or a significant part) of Wales."

Wales,2dn8ra,TCamilo19,1 point,Fri Aug 15 22:35:10 2014 UTC,"I've known of two ""save le pub"" campaigns?    The first was due to the owner selling the building, which meant the pub manager had to quickly find the cash to buy it herself.    This one seems to be due to sound complaints (didn't TJs experience something similar?)   It's not like the pub is failing to make profit or attract a regular crowd (it has always been very busy when I have been there and seems to be doing well).  It just seems to be unfortunate events."

Wales,2d5yx3,pal_b,7,Sun Aug 10 18:45:32 2014 UTC,"Outdoorsy stuff:   Brecon Beacons National Park for hiking. Pen-y-Fan is the highest mountain in South Wales and is piss easy to summit if you approach from the south. Climb its northern slopes if you fancy more of a real hike. Waterfall Country for more sheltered woodland walks. Loads of waterfalls, as you might expect, including one which you can walk behind. The Glamorgan Heritage Coast and the Gower Peninsula are the best places to head for coastal walks. Some particularly beautiful spots include Dunraven Bay in Glamorgan and Three Cliffs Bay and Rhossili on the Gower.   Historical stuff:   The best castles in the area IMO are, in no particular order, Caerphilly Castle (second largest castle in Britain), Castell Coch (a Victorian fantasy), Cardiff Castle (a Victorian mansion and Norman keep within the rebuilt walls of a Roman fortress), Castell Carreg Cennen (an imposing hilltop fortress of mixed Cambro-Norman heritage) and Chepstow Castle (a clifftop border fortress overlooking the River Wye). The National History Museum at St. Fagans outside Cardiff is probably one of the most visited places in Wales. Includes a massive open-air museum containing dozens of structures of all ages that were taken down from their original locations and reconstructed stone by stone within the museum. Big Pit for that not-quite-authentic coal mine experience.  Caerleon and Caerwent for all things Roman. Tintern Abbey for a spot of ecclesiastical reflection. The Abbey is within the Wye Valley on the border with England, another area that's well known for its natural beauty.   Towns and cities worth visiting:   Cardiff, obviously. In addition to its many castles and the National History Museum, it also plays host to the National Museum (period), the Dr. Who Experience (if that's your sort of thing), and quite a good shopping centre. Hay-on-Wye (in Powys) is a charming little border town chock full of bookshops, most of which are full of ancient stock that regular bookshops wouldn't dare put on their shelves. Hosts a literature festival every spring. One of the most characterful places in Wales, without a doubt. Brecon (also in Powys) is another beautiful place that has a certain Georgian grandeur that belies its small size. Not an awful lot there, though it does have a couple of small museums and a parish church that calls itself a cathedral. Also hosts a jazz festival, though unfortunately that's just finished. Still a very pleasant place to pass a couple of hours.   I don't think much of Merthyr itself, unfortunately. It's an ugly duckling to say the least, and consequentially I haven't spent much time there. There are a couple of sights which spring to mind which may be worth visiting, though: Cyfarthfa Castle and the Brecon Mountain Railway."

Roath Park has widely diverse environments across the park.  The park was built on 130 acres (0.53 km2) of reformed bogland, known then as a malarial bog, and includes a 30-acre (120,000 m2) lake 1.3 miles (2.1 km) around, formed by the damming of the Nant Fawr stream. It is a popular facility for fishing and rowing. There are four islands within a conservation area, home to many water birds.

I generally believe that we need to move away from large centralised governments and instead give smaller communities more control and power over their own destiny.  Even within the rest of the UK, I think local councils should be given more power and control within city/county borders.  I think independence for Scotland, whilst a huge gamble in many respects, is in principle a step in the right direction.

They change the entire foundation of the vote just to gain some more ballot papers, fucking pathetic.   The local governments have been getting more and more power and it hasn't been life changing so thats kinda void until they actually change dramatically county to county.   Without a large centralised governement who the fuck would run the UK national systems and overseas matters? Go Federal, yeah because that makes sense... I mean its not as if out constitution is based upon rapid change lending itself to a flexible system, unlike Federalism, take the US 20 reforms in a hundered years, 10 are the bill of rights, the 2 after that were bill of rights that didn't make it the first time round, then the rest were reforms cancelling out other reforms, that is since the birth of the USA in the last 4 years the UK has probably had more.

Wales,2bmbia,WobsJack,4,Thu Jul 24 19:15:39 2014 UTC,"In the interests of the avoidance of doubt...  A Principality of Wales did exist historically (from the 12th/13th centuries to 1542). The Principality was Welsh in origin, and was initially an attempt by the rulers of the Kingdom of Gwynedd to exert control over other native Welsh rulers within Wales. They were fairly successful in this regard, and by the time Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had firm control of the reins of power in the second half of the 13th century, the Principality controlled approximately 2/3rds of Wales and was starting to look like a united feudal state.  Then Edward I came along, trounced Llywelyn and conquered the nascent Principality. In the centuries that followed, the Principality continued to exist, though reduced in size (approximately corresponding to modern Anglesey, Gwynedd, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire), as an English possession. From time to time it was handed to the King's heir to rule as his personal demesne before he inherited the throne - this is why Prince Charles currently holds the title ""Prince of Wales"". The rest of Wales was divided between the King and the Marcher Lords - who were effectively petty kings in their own right, with very limited responsibilities to the crown.   This state of affairs ended in 1542 with Henry VIII's Laws in Wales Acts (sometimes erroneously referred to as an Act of Union between England and Wales). The effects of these acts were many, but included the abolishment of both the Principality and the Marcher Lordships, the annexation of the entirety of Wales to the Kingdom of England, and the division of Wales into a number of shires.  Needless to say, things have changed again since - the Laws in Wales Acts have been repealed and Wales is no longer considered a de jure part of England. Nonetheless, the Principality remains a thing of the past."
Wales,2bmbia,KaiserMacCleg,6,Thu Jul 24 20:04:02 2014 UTC,"It is a thing of the past, so, why is it even being mentioned in 2014? 472 years have passed since then!"
Wales,2bmbia,KaiserMacCleg,4,Thu Jul 24 20:39:39 2014 UTC,"Well, there won't be one motive. Ignorance, a desire to set the puny Principality of Wales aside from the mighty Kingdoms of England and Scotland (which, incidentally, also haven't been kingdoms for 307 years) or a desire to paint Wales in a romantic, historical light all could be behind the reasoning of different people."

Long shot.  Anyway, tartan is a mostly an ""Invented Tradition"". The idea that each clan had its own tartan only originated in the 19th Century. In fact, though striped and checked woven cloth has been found all over the world, especially in Celtic nations (such as Wales), it only really become popular in Scotland in the 1700s or so. So yeah, it's kind of invented. Not so much a scam, but it has no real historical basis (then again, neither does Scottish tartan. It's cultural without being a long tradition)  The Welsh Tartan shop in my town is one of the older commercial Welsh Tartan shops, invented by one of my Mum's old (and slightly odd, apparently) university friends."

Wales,2blaif,remlap,3,Thu Jul 24 19:34:30 2014 UTC,"Some of us care, and some of us don't give a crap.  For most of us Americans, some distant relative just picked up everything they owned, left their extended family and property and moved halfway across the world. We're a nation of immigrants who don't know our personal history for more than a couple generations back, living in a country that really doesn't have the established history like European nations do. We can't see buildings or towns that were built during the Norman Invasion. Our families haven't always lived in the same general region. We eat foreign foods on holidays because ""that's what we eat"". We're very much struggling to create identities for ourselves.  They say that America is a big melting pot of people, but that's not true - it's more like a bowl of salad. Everyone brought a bit of the old country with them when they came, and that doesn't necessarily make sense when you spend time with people from other heritages. I've dated Italians and Polish girls who take one look at a Sunday roast with popovers and refuse to eat, seen really strange customs at family gatherings, and met people with a totally different way of doing things even though we may have grown up doors down from each other. I think that all of these people haven't blended their cultures into one tangible culture, and that's difficult for many of us. We naturally seek out those who share culture and customs with us, but because our family may have a mishmash of cultures, we try to separate what's what and belongs to who.  I guess it's hard to translate, quantify, or describe why so many of us focus on our ancestry. Personally, I just want to be able to tell my kids their family history."

Wales,2blaif,remlap,2,Thu Jul 24 20:22:19 2014 UTC,"You do have an argument for that. My grandfather is from the valleys and once he earned a scholarship to Oxford in 1935, he never returned unless he had to during ww2 missions. After the war, he lived in Brighton and London. Found better opportunities for someone educated as a electrical engineer with war time experience and honors in America. Moved there and died there.  My story is different than the usual American with welsh relatives in a sense that his migration wasn't in a desperate mode escape something. Just a brain drain dynamic.  I can see the reason behind both thoughts on this issue. My grandfather could have stayed, he had a positive life in Wales and England, but he didnt stay.  But certainly didn't forget his heritage and passed on family stories that eventually made it to me.   I won't buy a Frikkin tartan though. ... I'll take one of your cool wooden spoons though."

Not sure about enclosing the old station building within the new development, though - I like that building. Seems to me it should be placed front and centre, facing onto the revamped Central Square. I guess Network Rail is after more floorspace to rent out.  I just hope Central Square's facelift is completed before the next economic downturn. Cardiff doesn't need another Adam Street...

I'll assume that the answer to both of the above questions is ""no"", for the moment.  Sights in Cardiff   Cardiff Castle Castell Coch National Museum of Wales (Art and national history these days - the history stuff has moved out to St. Fagans. Has quite a good collection of impressionist paintings - Monet and Turner and the like.) St. Fagans (Includes exhibitions on Welsh history and a large open air museum containing buildings of historical significance that were moved from their original locations and reconstructed stone by stone.) Cardiff Bay (Home of the Millenium Centre, the National Assembly and the Doctor Who Experience, amongst other stuff. A walk along the barrage can be a good way to cool off on a hot day.) Bute Park Roath Park   Sights in the surrounding area (which should be reasonably accessible by public transport)   Caerphilly Castle (Second biggest castle in Britain after Windsor) Caerleon (A suburb of Newport once home to a Roman legionary fortress on the scale of Chester or York. Plenty of remains to see including an amphitheatre and baths complex. There's also a small museum exhibiting Roman finds from across Wales.) Gower Peninsula (Beautiful landscapes...Rhossili Bay and Three Cliffs Bay would be top of my list to see. Easily accessible by bus from Swansea.) Brecon Beacons National Park (You mentioned hiking. This is where you'll find it. The best hiking is to be found along the main escarpment between Brecon and Merthyr. It's also an extremely forgiving mountain range, if you let it be. Pen-y-Fan, the highest peak at 886 m / 2907 ft, is a doddle if you approach from the Storey Arms to the south. I presume there are buses which pass the Storey Arms on the way between Brecon and Merthyr, but perhaps someone who's actually local could fill you in properly on that!)   If you do have access to a car, I highly recommend visiting Waterfall Country and the Black Mountains (plural, not singular - there's also a Black Mountain at the other end of the National Park) for some more great walks."

Thought I should include a couple of disclaimers here that I posted on the map's photostream page:   The meanings provided on the map should be taken with a pinch of salt. There is a very good chance that at least a few of the more obscure etymologies I've included in the map are erroneous. Multiple completing etymologies exist for a number of place names in Wales. Gwynedd, for example, here given as ""Land of the Wild People"", is derived from Proto Irish *Weidh-n-, via Old Irish Féni and Brythonic Vened- to give Welsh Gwynedd. Or, perhaps, it isn't. Perhaps it's derived from the Pictish tribal name Venicones - Gwynedd's semi-mythical founders. Perhaps it's derived from Old Irish fían, meaning ""war band"". Perhaps none of these explanations are correct. The map is, as of yet, unfinished. There are quite a few river names on the map (Gele, Mawddach, Aeron, Ogwr/Ogmore, Honddu, Tawe and Hafren/Severn), that I haven't been able to find any information on. If anyone can suggest a likely derivation, please let me know. If there are any towns or villages that I've left out and you would like to see included, get in touch! I think I've got room for a few more.   Finally, please note that this map contains etymologies of WELSH LANGUAGE names only.

Wales,2a31x0,calumhawk,2,Tue Jul 8 15:27:25 2014 UTC,How does Caerdydd (Cardiff) translate as 'Fort on the Dark River'? Surely it's 'Day Fort' or something.
Wales,2a31x0,tyrroi,5,Tue Jul 8 10:53:23 2014 UTC,"Nope! The Medieval form of Caerdydd was ""Caerdyf"", from which both the modern Welsh and English forms of the name are derived. The -dyf element was derived from the name of the local river, the Taf, and Taf is most likely an evolved form of a name meaning ""Dark"".   Loads of rivers in Britain share the same name - there's the Teifi in Wales, the Thames (Welsh Tafwys) in England, the Teme (Welsh Tefeidiad) in both, the Teviot, Tamar, Tavy and Tame. Probably others, too.  Interestingly enough the movement away from -dyf to -dydd may have been an example of folk etymology - i.e. people guessing at the meaning of the word and getting it wrong. Dyf has no obvious meaning in Welsh. Dydd does, and consequently the pronunciation of the place name changed over time."

An example from the other day:   Does this map show the very real problem Cardiff has with Islamic extremism?   ...the answer to which is, as with all headlines with a question mark at the end, ""no you fucking manipulative cunt"".  But then the bitch goes a step further and actually gives a definitive answer to her own stupid question that she so innocently posited:   ""This is the map that shows the very real problem Cardiff has with the radicalisation of young Muslims.""   Oh right ok fine that's settled, great work.  What follows then is a cheap recap of every story over the last 4 years possibly relating to extremism.

There is a hotel and a pub there, I've spent summer evenings sitting on the beach with a few drinks on my various visits over the years.  The arts centre at the top of the town is worth a look, especially if there's something on in the evening. In a converted church and the main hall has a really nice atmosphere for acoustic music.  Holyhead has suffered from being a place people pass through but it's surrounded by nice spots. Bangor or Caernarfon would probably be better for nightlife though."
Wales,29i09v,Gozaradio,1 point,Mon Jun 30 22:11:57 2014 UTC,Thanks for the info. Itinerary might be to walk to Trearddur bay on Saturday evening and have some drinks on the beach.

Wales,29i09v,Gozaradio,2,Mon Jun 30 22:21:16 2014 UTC,"Bring your own. The hotel bar will be a bit expensive, there is another bar/pub there but I can't remember if it's a private club or not (never actually been there, just the hotel).

The Waterfront in Trearddur Bay has just reopened so I can't really comment on that one though. In Holyhead the Standing Stones is quite good for both food and price but tends to fall down when it comes to the service and meals can take ages to come through. Pubwise there's the 79, Gleesons and the Stanley, all near the center of town."
Wales,29i09v,moz_1983,2,Mon Jun 30 23:10:38 2014 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, Holyhead has a really small population, around 12000 at most. Literally it's a port town and from what I know of port cities (Newport) nightlife is shit. Sure you got Pubs etc but nothing like clubs or w/e. Then again I could be wrong.  However what it does have is a lot of activities like coasteering and so on. Also loads of Roman (caer gybi is there) and Viking history if you want to look at that."
Wales,29i09v,rallyhomofo,1 point,Mon Jun 30 21:17:29 2014 UTC,Yeah. Honestly we were just looking for something to do on a budget this weekend and wanted to get out of Dublin and found out about the ferry and thought why not. Doesn't really matter too much if there's not sweet clubs or anything. We would be fine with just hanging out near the port/shore/etc. and just drinking at a pub for the night.

Another thing is Welsh fans are forced to watch the WC from an English perspective, are bombarded with English merchandise and are often told ""Our teams should just join together and be Team GB!"" meaning ""We'll just take your best players, keep our team's culture and identity, but rename the Team ""Team GB""!"".

Wales,285m8r,Fatally_Flawed,0,Sun Jun 15 11:41:53 2014 UTC,"But I don't think that's hypocritical either. In international terms, England are Wales' rivals. Sure, England don't really care about us, why would they? We're nowhere near their level. But regardless, England are ""the old enemy"". It's like the old rivalry between City and United. When City weren't great, the match against United was the biggest of their season, while it wasn't as big for United as it was against, say, Liverpool.   When clubs popular in Wales like Liverpool or Everton are playing in the EPL they're not representing England, so I see little reason that it's hypocritical for Welsh people to support them. Plenty of Irish supporters are massive Celtic fans and there's a big Irish/Scottish rivalry. International and club rivalries aren't easy to compare, and it's not hypocritical to support an English club, but revel in the failings of the English national team. It's not as simple as that."

They won't get the same (way, way over the top) media attention in 2016 like they did this year, so I expect to see a much lower UKIP haul. They are certainly in with a chance and look pretty likely to pick up list seats in North Wales and South Wales East, but that's as good as they'll manage, in my opinion.   Expect to see a minority Labour government struggle before eventually doing a deal with Plaid to see a big devolution settlement, possibly involving the devolution of the constitution that Leanne Wood recently called for."
Wales,282lrt,Danibaldi,2,Sat Jun 14 10:46:01 2014 UTC,"Assumptions of those results aside, I'm not totally sure how I feel about UKIP ending up the assembly. On the one hand they have always been anti-devolution which is a big ""go to hell"" from me but then it's only recently that Nigel has stated they accept devolution is happening and won't attempt to abolish the assembly.  I would cautiously welcome a change in attitude but until I see a manifesto on their stance on devolution I'd rather not end up with UKIP in the assembly contributing bugger all to the running of Wales if their stance remains the same."
Wales,282lrt,Jindail,2,Fri Jun 13 20:04:24 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure that the leopard has changed his spots either. The party leadership may recognise that an outward attitude of acceptance is more appealing to the electorate at large than calling for the abolition of the devolved administrations, but that doesn't mean that their own beliefs have changed, or that the wider membership isn't hostile to the idea of devolution.  That said, there's plenty of other reasons why I wouldn't trust UKIP with a damn thing - not least their policy of going full ostrich with regard to climate change."

Wales,27gloi,garfield4317,7,Sun Jun 8 13:40:38 2014 UTC,"Apologies for the wall of text, and I hope I don't sound too negative, but this is something I've been giving a lot of thought to recently.  I'm probably on the other end of the spectrum to you, and I know this treacherous blasphemy, but I think having Welsh as a mandatory subject is ultimately detrimental to the Welsh population..   I think having Welsh as a mandatory subject is what is holding Welsh GCSE results back, compared to England's. I don't know how it was for you guys, but for me - years 7-9 had 3 welsh lessons a week, 10-11 short course it was 1 lesson a week (If you didn't opt to take Welsh as a GCSE you still had to do the short course which ground my gears quite a bit), all those lessons add up to a lot of time that could be dedicated elsewhere.  I found in secondary school my knowledge of the Welsh Language actually regressed from what I had known in primary school, I was in a class of kids who couldn't give a fuck about Welsh, and I was probably one of the most pretentious little twats when I was aged around 13-16; ""This is not relevant to my live, I will never need to speak Welsh, everyone speaks English, the Language is dying, you can only speak it here and in patagonia, what's the point?"".   Looking back I realise how immature this was, but, at the time, given my life experiences I drew conclusions, formed my judgements & saw no reason to learn the language, and thought the only reason it was being kept alive was for purely emotive reasons, which didn't compute with my overly rational brain at the time.  Now I'm 21 and I've worked as a teaching assistant & cover supervisor, in both primary & secondary schools, so I understand both sides of the coin, and it is very difficult to teach children something they don't want to learn, as well as it is difficult to teach something you don't feel passionate about (this has been more noticeable in primary schools from my experiences, they have to teach the bear minimum, so they learn the bare minimum).  Another issue I've found more prominent in secondary schools is that a lot of children won't have much respect for a Welsh teacher, assuming they got their job just because they could speak a language, but the truth is that they've slogged their bollocks off and worked damn hard for a degree and for their job too...  Tbh I think the whole educational system is pretty fucked up from the foundations to the roof, we keep kids of the same age together, so they're slower to mature because they're not interacting with older people as much.   We have mixed ability classes, which frustrate children of all abilities because the harder workers/smarter kids feel held back, and the kids that have to really try hard to grasp something can't hold the pace and are left to feel less intelligent. We teach all the kids such a vast amount of information they don't care about, so they don't retain it, we have bulimia learning before exams (German expression, cram too much knowledge in at once and you'll be sick and won't digest it). Furthermore, we teach them how to pass exams, rather actually how to learn by themselves or how to expand on something they're really interested in.. And it really frustrates me, I think we'd be better off having an educational system tailored to children's wants and abilities rather than painting them all with the same brush, I think every child should have their subject times decided by themselves & their parents.  I hope I've not come across as being holier-than-thou, or as having all the answers, or even fully understanding it.. I've talked a bit matter-of-fact-ishly about this, but this is just my opinion from my experiences."
Wales,27gloi,welshman2495,4,Sat Jun 7 09:33:34 2014 UTC,"I understand alot of your points and I felt the same when I was in school. Welsh lessons felt like a chore. There was not really any passion from the teachers about it, it droned on like maths etc.  I do believe that learning Welsh is a good thing, it's part of our culture, our history and it's quite useful to be bilingual. I think a heavy effort needs to be made to make Welsh a more enjoyable subject to learn and not something that students dread or find boring."
Wales,27gloi,tyrroi,5,Sat Jun 7 10:03:55 2014 UTC,"As i've said before, all language learning in schools is shit. Your spend what, 13 years learning Welsh?

Wales,27gloi,CookieComet,3,Sat Jun 7 12:36:49 2014 UTC,"Though I can't really relate to it, that's quite sad somehow for me.

The Rummer Tavern opposite the castle is 300 years old and very friendly. If you're here for a Sunday you must get a roast dinner (or wherever in Britain you are). Most pubs will do a Sunday roast.

Following the road there is a turning to the left that leads down to Port Penrhyn and Dicky's Boatyard. Turn down there and follow it.  The road splits, to the left the boatyard and to the right a stone bridge. Do not go over the bridge, that leads to the Penrhyn Estate (private property), although you can stand on the bridge fine. It's the one in the picture and has a nice view.  Instead bear left and head towards Dicky's boat yard. There is a second bridge, not of stone, over the River Cegin. Go over that and then turn right, going under the stone bridge.  Et voila! You have found the path.  There are numerous other routes to it, there are I think two places you can get onto it in Meisgeirchan, but that one is the most convenient for me. Have fun exploring!"

The basic design of the flag by Mayum Choying Wangmo Dorji dates to 1947. A version was displayed in 1949 at the signing of the Indo-Bhutan Treaty. A second version was introduced in 1956 for the visit of Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuk to eastern Bhutan; it was based upon photos of its 1949 predecessor and featured a white Druk in place of the green original.

Wales,25uy8v,merlinho,4,Sun May 18 13:00:40 2014 UTC,"This IS a problem in Swansea streets around Townhill, the issue is more caused by straying dogs of which there are several. One on my street is allowed out onto the road all day. When I confronted the owner, he simply told me it was his dog, and the neighbours were all used to him as he's been letting the dog out for years.  Unfortunately he's too afraid of people so capture is impossible. I used to pick up one or two per month and report to the police on the first capture to enable rehoming, then deliver to the pound the second time... but I've pretty much given up now.  Here's hoping those straying animals see the pink and realise the error of their ways because many dog owners up here don't give a crap, dog or otherwise."
Wales,25uy8v,slicksps,3,Sun May 18 17:09:58 2014 UTC,"That dog should not be allowed to roam free. He could get injured, cause a road traffic accident, eat something that will make him ill, or destroy someone else's property. He might even get attacked (especially around Townhill). If he's human-shy, that suggests he's had a few unpleasant encounters with stray humans - even if the humans in question meant no harm. Please make no further attempts to contain him, as that will only reinforce his human-fear.  Since you've already confronted the owner, doing so a second time is optional (but advisiable). The RSPCA are arsing slow, but please call them about this dog, preferably the moment you next see him loose. They'll come over, offer an official warning to the owner, then do nothing. Every time you see the dog loose, tell the owner. If he refuses to recall his dog, or does so and then lets him out again a few minutes later, ring the RSPCA again. Either the owner will get the message, and keep the dog in his own sodding garden, or the RSPCA will seize him and have him rehomed - and if the RSPCA actually decide to sieze a dog, then you know that dog needs a new home.  Please, from the tone of your comment you sound sick of this, but think of the dog. If he's being left to roam the streets unsupervised, then his owner probably doesn't care much for him. He deserves a better home. At least make that first phone call, even if you don't plan to follow-up. It might be all the help he needs.  EDIT: Also, please call RSPCA only for the dog you know is being neglected. If you see a random dog wandering the streets without a collar and with no human claiming responsibility nearby, call Dog's Trust, not the RSPCA. The distinction is important.  RSPCA = Neglected/abused pets.  Dog's Trust = Suspected stray dogs."

Everywhere you went, dog shit, random dogs in your garden, barking at you if you dared to go outside, shitting all over your lawn.

So i'd probably say Bale. Think of all the countries that for whatever reason (language, politics etc) western pop music didn't become popular, or at least wasn't popular during the height of Tom Jones's fame and relevance. I'd say those countries are more numerous than countries where football isn't popular. And if you're into football, you'll know the name Gareth Bale."

The tone it was said is all too common.  If you cant speak welsh in wales where the fuck do you ? If you dnt like people speaking another language learn the language !! (If I was in england I wouldnt speak welsh if people couldnt understand me .out of courtesy. But in wales they can fuck off ! Its out of courtesy they should learn the language ) rant over
Wales,25hreq,welshdude1983,-2,Wed May 14 10:01:33 2014 UTC,"Whereas you raise valid points, I fear they may be overly patriotic to be workable.  In short, we go to a GP or a doctor to find a cure for a problem. Hell, we wouldn't go to a doctor if it's something we could treat ourselves. Even if the remark was made, telling them to ""fuck right off"" probably wouldn't get you very far in life. Certainly in the Southern areas of Wales, moreso in the South East, you're more likely to find someone being told to ""fuck right off"" if they start with the ""This is Wales, I will speak Welsh"" act rather than vice versa - but of course spoken Welsh is massively more common in the North where this incident is believed to have taken place.  I've been on the business end of it myself - the first time I went to a pub in Chepstow , it was a rather pleasant place. However, the moment the landlords clocked my accent, the whole atmosphere changed, it was almost as if I was some faraway stranger wandering in with a faraway accent and causing a scene. My personal view was that these are modern times, Chepstow is probably becoming more of a Bristol commuter town and the proximity to the border probably meant that Welsh people may have been less common. I didn't see the need to do anything out of courtesy though, or consider ""where the fuck can you"" use the accent?  I feel the whole thing is blown out of proportion. It's likely a simple quote taken out of context and surrounded by a sob story to flog papers."
Wales,25hreq,RomeroGoon,7,Wed May 14 14:15:32 2014 UTC,Overly patriotic? And if you read the article youd see this happend in North wales. English wasn't even first language to this doctor. If she was speaking her own language to a nurse say in england while treating a english speaking patient  you would be up in arms about it. The ignorance of people like you who thinks speaking the welsh language is merely being overly patriotic is the reason such incidents happen in the first place
Wales,25hreq,welshdude1983,0,Wed May 14 14:27:14 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Thanks for directing me to read the article when my comment specifically referenced the fact that the incident took part in North Wales too.   I'm not saying speaking the Welsh language is ""overly patriotic"" at all. I am merely stating that expecting everyone in a public service - be they doctors, nurses, firefighters, librarians - to learn Welsh is just not a workable solution. Being more specific to this example, considering that a great deal of our medical staff are brought in from overseas where English would be their second language, asking them to speak Welsh when their current skills are perfectly appropriate seems overly demanding.  To take this one step further, I would certainly debate whether I'd be ""up in arms"" about whether a doctor and a nurse were conversing in the native language. So long as I was kept updated in due course and that my care was of a higher standard, I wouldn't be all that bothered if they were tapping away in morse code between themselves.  Similarly, I'm no doctor but I very much doubt a reasonable person - doctor or no - would really care whether their patients are speaking between themselves in Welsh - crack on! So long as it doesn't affect the way the doctor is doing their job then there's no real reason to kick up a fuss, which is one of the key things which makes me think this article is a little suspect.  Hey, opinions are free for all though :)"

Of course I don't want the incident to have happened! Any normal upstanding person wouldn't want this to happen at all. However, I was merely debating whether it did happen in the not-so-subtle way it was portrayed in the article.  In an earlier comment you kindly took the time to brand me uninformed - the comment thread here clearly highlights the efforts I have made to state that I have no 'inside knowledge' of this incident, and am merely commenting on the linked article. Again, I have said that the article itself is sparsely populated with facts, and as such my opinion may well be way off the mark.

I do think it makes it less valid if others who are more informed than you make it clear how uninformed you are. It gives you an opportunity to change your opinion because you can re-evaluate with more information.   Not sure why you're trying to be patronising but I hope it helps you feel better about how dumb you come across when you're so proud about making up stuff and basing your opinion on that.

I can't see a doctor stating the above verbatim, or in any arrangement or fashion. Most modern hospitals have a lot going on, and from my experience of busy A&E depts, most doctors wouldn't give a toss if you were communicating in semaphore let alone a mother tongue, so long as it didn't interfere with what the doctor or paramedic was trying to do.  Plus, even if the remark was indeed made, what's wrong with clarifying with the doctor that it was in the girl's own interest and that it wasn't a personal potshot? Why go to the papers?

Wales,25hreq,HerrMackerel,3,Wed May 14 11:57:40 2014 UTC,"I guess the only justification for this would be if the doctor wanted to make sure that the information the mother was giving the daughter was factually, medically sound.

Wales,25g6vc,welshman2495,3,Tue May 13 22:02:56 2014 UTC,Bryan Sykes did some good research on this. It was in the book/documentary Blood of the Isles. He found that you still can roughly find enclaves of certain groups. Like Yorkshire is still full of Vikings and the west is full of people sharing DNA with Caernarfon folk.  I'm explaining this like a noob. More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Sykes#Blood_of_the_Isles
Wales,25g6vc,autowikibot,1 point,Tue May 13 22:15:32 2014 UTC,"Section 1. Blood of the Isles of article  Bryan Sykes:       In his 2006 book Blood of the Isles (published in the United States and Canada as Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland), Sykes examines British genetic ""clans"". He presents evidence from mitochondrial DNA, inherited by both sexes from their mothers, and the Y chromosome, inherited by men from their fathers, for the following points:   The genetic makeup of Britain and Ireland is overwhelmingly what it has been since the Neolithic period and to a very considerable extent since the Mesolithic period, especially in the female line, i.e. those people, who in time would become identified as British Celts (culturally speaking), but who (genetically speaking) should more properly be called Cro-Magnon [citation needed]. In continental Europe, this same Cro-Magnon genetic legacy gave rise to the Basques. But ""Basque"" and ""Celt"" are cultural designations, not genetic ones [citation needed]. The contribution of the Celts of Central Europe to the genetic makeup of Britain and Ireland was minimal; most of the genetic contribution to the British Isles of those we think of as Celtic, came from western continental Europe, I.E. the Atlantic seaboard. The Picts were not a separate people: the genetic makeup of the formerly Pictish areas of Scotland shows no significant differences from the general profile of the rest of Britain. The two ""Pictland"" regions are Tayside and Grampian. The Anglo-Saxons are supposed, by some, to have made a substantial contribution to the genetic makeup of England, but in Sykes's opinion it was under 20 percent of the total, even in Southern England. The Vikings (Danes and Norwegians) also made a substantial contribution, which is concentrated in central, northern and eastern England - the territories of the ancient Danelaw. There is a very heavy Viking contribution in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, in the vicinity of 40 percent. Women as well as men contributed substantially in all these areas, showing that the Vikings engaged in large-scale settlement. The Norman contribution was extremely small, on the order of 2 percent. There are only sparse traces of the Roman occupation, almost all in Southern England. In spite of all these later contributions, the genetic makeup of the British Isles remains overwhelmingly what it was in the Neolithic: a mixture of the first Mesolithic inhabitants with Neolithic settlers who came by sea from Iberia and ultimately from the eastern Mediterranean. There is a difference between the genetic histories of men and women in Britain and Ireland. The matrilineages show a mixture of original Mesolithic inhabitants and later Neolithic arrivals from Iberia, whereas the patrilineages are much more strongly correlated with Iberia. This suggests (though Sykes does not emphasize this point) replacement of much of the original male population by new arrivals with a more powerful social organization. There is evidence for a ""Genghis Khan effect"", whereby some male lineages in ancient times were much more successful than others in leaving large numbers of descendants; e.g. Niall of the Nine Hostages in 4th and 5th century Ireland and Somerled in 12th century Scotland.   Some quotations from the book follow. (Note that Sykes uses the terms ""Celts"" and ""Picts"" to designate the pre-Roman inhabitants of the Isles who spoke Celtic and does not mean the people known as Celts in central Europe.)

Wales,2576nh,LolFishFail,1 point,Sat May 10 10:55:18 2014 UTC,"I went on a School multi-day trip thing there to continue learning second language Welsh. Stayed in the old houses, When you'd look out and see the pitch blackness of the woods surrounding the village, So very creepy and isolating.  One of the people I met there got stuck in their room, For some inexplicable reason the door to the room wouldn't open. It was unlocked the handle was turned but it wasn't budging... bloody old door, it was the first time I kicked a door in, It luckily didn't make any damage other than a chip around the frame, so nobody was any wiser and I made a new friend because of it.  On about day 3 it must have been about 10 at night, The houses were locked during the day because of everyone's valuables. So we were waiting for them to be unlocked, they had the lights on so you could see inside though. I spotted a man walking past the windows on the inside, I pointed him out to everyone too, they saw him as well. He was completely dressed in black (almost like a cloak he was wearing, a poncho even), I distinctly remember him almost awkwardly avoiding looking at us it seemed, then he headed towards the back of the house, out of sight. We just all thought he was a cleaner or something.  Well, the teachers and staff unlocked the houses for use to go inside and so we all went to sleep, The next morning I was making a brew and thought about what happened the night before, with the man in black. I realise that there was nowhere for that person to go without bumping into us the night beforehand and there was no reason for him to be inside a locked building... I honestly believe I saw a ghost that night."

There's a fantastic documentary called 'Swansea Love Story' that's about that very thing. It makes for extremely grim viewing but in all honesty it could've easily taken place in Cardiff.   There's just a bit of a 'runner up' mentality with Swansea sometimes, just as much as there's a self importance that reeks from Cardiff sometimes.

They may appear to simply be shops selling a variety of overpriced craft goods, but the reality is far more sinister. Polly is a front for a shadowy organisation that controls Aberystwyth, which is also, unimaginatively, called Polly. Agents for Polly operate throughout the North Ceredigion area, being instructed via coded messages printed in the Cambrian news.  As you are a student, you should be aware of the Polly-sanctioned 'Student Exclusion Zones' that exist throughout the town. These zones include Penparcau, Plascrug Leisure Centre and the Vale pub. Access to the Exclusion Zones is denied to students at all times, with one exception. Transit through Penparcau for students is permitted for holders of a special transit pass, valid only on certain days at the beginning and end of term. The Penparcau Student Transit Pass can only be obtained by hand delivering an application form to a Polly branch five years in advance. All application forms must be completed in Welsh.  Any student found in a Student Exclusion zone without the necessary documentation will be taken away by Polly agents (or in the case of Penparcau, members of the 'Arky crew', who are Polly puppets). They will then be marched up Pendinas, hoisted to the top of the Wellington monument and left as a warning to other students to not break the rules.  Welcome to Aber."

Pentre Ifan (pen tree even) is in north Pembs too its like a miniature stone henge. Solva itself has a very quaint feel with a few nice shops, and a really good art gallery in the docks. a great restaurant is tavern zinc near the Presselli hills.  another cool historical sight is st Govan's which is a really old church that was built into a cliff.  if you want more adventure Pembrokeshire has a small theme park called Oakwood which is a great day out. there is also Heatherton which is more of an outdoor adventure center with archery paintball go carts etc. my personal favorite beach is broad haven south, it has a long walk to it past Bosherston Lilly ponds and among sand dunes but that is the south coast of Pembrokeshire about 40 minutes drive from Solva. st Davids has great beaches itself i don't know many of the more local quaint beaches of north Pembrokeshire being from Milford Haven. (30 minutes away from Solva)which has a few nice bars but its a bit of a shitty town. if you want to be a classic tourist Tenby is the place to go, it does have really nice beaches and cafe's and restaurants (the kook a bar in particular is very nice, its Australian themed though) but because Tenby is so very nice over the summer you cant move for tourists and locals that flock there year after year. if your looking for a proper city with great culture the capital of Wales is Cardiff and its a very vibrant city. Avoid Swansea I'm in university here and its a grim city with very little on offer other than a great student nightlife. the drive up cardigan bay is also a nice drive."

It is situated on a steep hillside high above the village of Tongwynlais, to the north of Cardiff in Wales, and is a Grade I listed building as from 28 January 1963.   Designed by William Burges, with an impressively medieval appearance, working portcullis and drawbridge, and sumptuous interiors which rival those of Cardiff Castle, it has been described as ""the most spectacular example of [that architect's] translation from High Gothic into High Victorian.""

Caerphilly Castle (Welsh: Castell Caerffili) is a medieval fortification in Caerphilly in South Wales. The castle was constructed by Gilbert de Clare in the 13th century as part of his campaign to conquer Glamorgan, and saw extensive fighting between Gilbert and his descendants and the native Welsh rulers. Surrounded by extensive artificial lakes – considered by historian Allen Brown to be ""the most elaborate water defences in all Britain"" – it occupies around 30 acres (120,000 m2) and is the second largest castle in Britain.  It is famous for having introduced concentric castle defences to Britain and for its large gatehouses.  Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was opposed by Gilbert's Welsh rival Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, leading to the site being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271. Despite these interruptions, Gilbert successfully completed the castle and took control of the region. The core of Caerphilly Castle, including the castle's luxurious accommodation, was built on what became a central island, surrounding by several artificial lakes, a design Gilbert probably derived from that at Kenilworth. The dams for these lakes were further fortified, and an island to the west provided additional protection. The concentric rings of walls inspired Edward I's castles in North Wales, and proved what historian Norman Pounds has termed ""a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain"".

Wales,22m3fw,CA3080,4,Wed Apr 9 15:31:51 2014 UTC,"From Bristol Parkway, you can go direct to Swansea. From Swansea you get buses to places on the Gower during the day, not sure how late they run. There may also be buses from Swansea to Brecon too.   Trains from Swansea can go to Camarthen and Pembroke as well.   Gower and Brecon are great place to go walking or hiking, and there are a number of campsites on Gower that are very close to the beach, we're talking walking distance.  Hope this helps!"
Wales,22m3fw,EpicEllz,3,Wed Apr 9 17:13:52 2014 UTC,The Gower coastline is stunning and the Swansea buses go from the city centre right out to some of my favorite walks in the world in under an hour!  Couldn't agree more with this recommendation

Wales,22m3fw,BigHowski,3,Wed Apr 9 17:53:01 2014 UTC,"I used to live in horfield a few years ago and coming from Wales I made the trip by train a lot! Your best off getting to parkway as they have a direct line in to South Wales. Newport, Cardiff, Swansea and Bridgend are pretty easy to get to. IIRC you can also easily get to Carmarthen but the trains are not as regular. After that is where is gets difficult via trains. For example going up the valleys (towards Caerphilly) is a right pain on a Sunday as it's one train every two hours. Still don't let that put you off!   Cardiff is a great city and it's really nice down the bay where you can get easily via train. I have heard good things about the doctor who experience (not a fan never been). Cardiff has a castle and quite a few nice parks as well.   Swansea is real nice and you have the gower close by (which is my favourite place in the UK) lots of nice walks and beaches if that's your thing. Never been to the gower by public transport, I know there is a train station closer but it's not close to the beaches IIRC"
Wales,22m3fw,bluepaul,3,Wed Apr 9 19:31:08 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure there's a bus from Cardiff which can stop at Storey arms. From there a nice walk up the Beacons could work (there are some specific walks on the Brecon Beacons national park website), returning to Storey arms for a bus back. The walk should take a few hours.  Oh and personally I'd recommend the Megabus to Cardiff over the train, mainly because its usually cheaper, and its closer to me than the train station."
Wales,22fxqt,Ddraig_Coch,17,Mon Apr 7 17:49:59 2014 UTC,"I'm fully welsh but a non-fluent welsh speaker and I have been belittled by many fluent welsh speakers as to not be ""properly welsh"" because i do not speak the language fluently. They have considered themselves better than me and more patriotic even though i love being from wales and love being welsh. It is annoying that people can use it against others however I do believe that is not necessarily a welsh thing but more of a global thing where humans feel the need to guard ""their territory""."

I am still massively resentful for the half-grade GCSE Welsh course being made compulsory in secondary schools where teenage students had zero interest in studying the language - that hour per week could have been better spent on core subjects.  That's not an anti-Welsh pop mind you, I have every respect for those who choose to study Welsh as a language - both primarily and as a second language and they have my full support."

Wales,22fxqt,tyrroi,2,Tue Apr 8 05:28:03 2014 UTC,"I went to a Welsh school in a non-welsh area, and the teachers were forcing the children to speak Welsh at all times in school by age 11. I've always thought it was ridiculous to expect an 11 year old to be able to speak fluently in a second language constantly, especially when surrounded by other children who speak their first language. Of course, as they grew and learnt the language to a better level everybody spoke it more often and by sixth form it was the most commonly spoken language. But this was after years of learning and after many hated the language for years. Forcing kids to speak it at an early level just creates resentment."
Wales,22fxqt,metalmorgan,3,Tue Apr 8 10:14:38 2014 UTC,"I remember learning Welsh in school, it was fucking horrible. The Welsh room was right at the back of the school, had no windows, something that probably isn't even allowed now.  Because it had no windows it was always boiling hot, which made you sweat which then made the room absolutely stink. The teacher was a fat cow, bloody horrible.   Couldn't of been less interested in the language while in school and since I left I couldn't be more interested in the language. Listening to Welsh music and everything has got me very interested.  It's not just Welsh that is taught badly though it's all languages, Spanish, French, German."
Wales,22fxqt,BananaJuice1,1 point,Tue Apr 8 11:22:06 2014 UTC,"Very true, though most don't have the same kind of publicity as welsh with people almost desperately trying to keep it alive, which is why it tends to get more bad press in the whole 'being shoved down people's throats' type of way. I defiantly think it's being gone about the wrong way, investing in welsh language (with subtitles for learners/non-speakers) quality programming, music and interests would be the way to go you would think, get young people interested and they'll grow up wanting to learn rather than having to"

The pub in the village I live now doesn't have a pool table for some reason, so I don't bother going in there. If they had one, they'd have my custom."
Wales,216938,kirkum2020,1 point,Mon Mar 24 09:59:38 2014 UTC,The pool league in my village collapsed and nobody wants to run it anymore.  The district league for the town 5 miles away is doing well but most people just go to the pub for pool matches it seems.  Some evenings in my village if it wasn't for the quiz or darts leagues then most of the pubs would be empty all night. Yet it's these teams that some landlords have tried to marginalise in favour of getting people in through the door drinking.
Wales,216938,scratchyNutz,2,Mon Mar 24 19:46:06 2014 UTC,"It is a shame, but as you say, it may be pretty irreversible. So many factors against pubs these days."
Wales,216938,popty_ping,6,Sun Mar 23 20:49:22 2014 UTC,"Mainly one problem and it is reversible.  Everyone mentions how many pubs are closing but never say how many of them reopen shortly after.  Pubcos, the businesses that the breweries created to buy their pubs when they were forced to sell them off, have learned a particularly nasty trick.  Pubcos have learned that, in their smaller pubs, they can make more money from landlords than punters.  They know many people dream of becoming a landlord or landlady and are willing to spend a fair bit of money to do so.  They get tied into horrid contracts, expecting them to meet targets that the pubco can change at any time.  New people pay anything from a few to tens of thousands of pounds just to move in, then the pubco might get them to dig deep for any maintenance work or refurbishment.  Next, they'll start raising your targets.  Considering that, by being tied to one of these companies, the pub can only offer a very poor range of equally poor drinks at ridiculous prices, those targets will be impossible to make.  Either the landlord makes way for the next mug or the bailiffs move in.  I'm sure we could do the same to the pubcos as we did to the breweries if the political will was really there but these are enormous businesses with a lot of money so don't hold your breath.  I truly believe that if we were to see more independent pubs, selling good drinks at a sensible price, we'd see a scaling back of our binge drinking culture too.  Good luck getting a license from your local council if your name isn't Wetherspoon, Yates or the like though."

Alongside the Toldi trilogy it is one of his most important works.  Arany was asked to write a poem of praise for the visit of Franz Joseph I of Austria, as were other Hungarian poets. Arany instead wrote about the tale of the 500 Welsh bards sent to the stake by Edward I of England for failing to sing his praises at a banquet in Montgomery Castle. The poem was intended as a metaphor to criticise the Habsburg rule over Hungary after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. It was a method of passive resistance to the repressive politics of Alexander von Bach in Hungary, and the planned visit of the monarch.    The poem was written ""for the desk drawer"" and was first published 6 years later in 1863, disguised as a translation of an Old English ballad, order to evade censorship.

Otherwise the 'ng' sound is pretty awkward if you separate it from the previous word.  Some optional information on pronunciation, if you want:  The singular 'f' in Welsh is also hard if you didn't know that already (like the English 'v')  The 'u' is pronounced similarly to 'ee' (methu = meth-ee). There's a slight difference between the actual pronunciation and 'ee' but it'd still sound more natural than an 'oo' sound (if natural's what you're aiming for)  The 'dd' is a thick 'th' in English (as in 'this')"

They lived in Great Britain during the Iron Age, the Roman era and the post-Roman era. After the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons the population was either subsumed into Anglo-Saxon culture, becoming ""English""; retreated; or persisted in the Celtic fringe areas of Wales, Cornwall and southern Scotland, with some emigrating to Brittany. The relationship of the Britons to the Picts north of the Forth has been the subject of much discussion, though most scholars accept that the Pictish language during this time was a branch of Common Brittonic.

Wales,1zplq4,myfi,3,Fri Mar 7 05:21:14 2014 UTC,If your not Welsh why do you care so much? We have our history and culture represented we have flags we are self aware this isn't Northern Ireland most people don't care for the union most are happy to be in it because of economics but personally I don't really see myself as British so why the hell would I care what the union jack looks like. As long as we can celebrate our culture among ourselves why do we need to ram it in other people's faces?
Wales,1zplq4,iowa92,13,Fri Mar 7 10:32:01 2014 UTC,"We've got the best flag going,  doesn't bother me at all that we're not included on the union jack."

Wales,1zplq4,KaiserMacCleg,23,Fri Mar 7 05:22:24 2014 UTC,"Which flag do we include? The Dragon or the Cross of St David?  I'm not bothered, but the Union Flag doesn't represent me. My flag is the flag of Wales. I'm Welsh, not British."

Wales,1zplq4,Osborne85,1 point,Thu Mar 6 16:22:18 2014 UTC,Bear in mind though that the Welsh flag represents the colours of the Tudor royals.
Wales,1zplq4,RealSourLemonade,2,Thu Mar 6 19:28:04 2014 UTC,"Well, the green and the white does. The dragon is a far older symbol, going back as far as Roman times if not further."
Wales,1zplq4,IncorrectMemeChoice,1 point,Thu Mar 6 19:43:19 2014 UTC,"The Cross of St David seems like the only viable option, no doubt a change in the flag is extremely unlikely.   As I replied to someone else here with the same sought of question, shouldn't you deal with the fact that the UK does exist and Wales is apart of it; yet it is unrepresented? I completely understand being Welsh before British, but in near all matters of international relations the UK is the preferred option rather than the individual countries. As a person who is not from any of the countries in the British Isles, I never refer to someone as British."
Wales,1zplq4,rachtee,2,Fri Mar 7 05:28:45 2014 UTC,"I have dealt with it. The government that I pay my taxes to and goes to war on my behalf (ha) is the UK one I'm an active citizen of Wales and the UK. That doesn't make me any more British, I have no affinity with that. My view is this predominantly ""British"" identity is a curious thing that probably only now exists in the upper classes and (English) people with a weird nostalgia for the Empire (this is controversial but eh) or the generally quite socially conservative and that's fine, that's part of being in a nation of nations. Its hardly unique to the UK for sub national peoples to have separate identities to their state either, many Bavarians see themselves as Bavarian not German, tirolians as that not Austrian/Italian etc.  I don't see a good argument for Wales being represented on the flag and it doesn't bother me, it's a historic anachronism. Where it comes to Wales being under represented let's sort out the actual material things that screw Wales over compared to the rest of the UK, like chronic un and underemployment, low GVA, lower life expectancy, poor public transport , reliance on the public sector, weak media etc. The flag and what I choose as my identity is trivial and whining about ""cultural suppression"" by our larger neighbour constantly is next to useless when they still don't care. At some point down the line I probably do care, but its so far down my list of priorities at the moment."
Wales,1zplq4,rachtee,6,Fri Mar 7 07:44:49 2014 UTC,"It bothers me more that the british national anthem is the English one. It's not even good. The flag I'm not bothered about, we have our own flag :)"

All the suggestions for the inclusion of a Welsh element to the flag look like shit, In the end it's just a flag, we have our devolved Government and if we want it we can devolve more/go independent."
Wales,1zplq4,Elljp33,0,Thu Mar 6 12:29:02 2014 UTC,"What about adding the flag of St. David? However, that is a religious symbol of something that is not indigenously Welsh.  I understand having a devolved government and the ability for independence, but Wales not being included seems like a remnant of English dominance and British suppression. Would you agree with that? I don't understand how someone can accept such a remnant."
Wales,1zplq4,Elljp33,1 point,Fri Mar 7 05:32:29 2014 UTC,St David is the only patron Saint of any Uk nation that was born in the country he's the Saint of though. And its not like Christianity is indigenous to the UK full stop.

Lets not let the past sour the future, we don't need to bother squabbling  over some stupid flag, If Scotland decide to leave then perhaps it will be time to change the flag.  and you have to admit, the flag looks pretty good as it is, the suggestions for a new one all seem a bit... meh."

Wales,1zplq4,Joe64x,5,Fri Mar 7 10:25:40 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I am not THAT bothered. I mean, I would like to see us represented in some way but I think that the union jack is a british icon and should be left the way it is. I have seen a few mockups of the UK flag with a dragon in the corner or in the centre etc and I just think it looks better without. The possibility of incorporating the flag of St David I feel would be a better option however I am not annoyed that it is not likely to become part of the flag.   I personally don't feel that the current flag is a sign of the dominance of when the flag was created, however I am sure there are other people in Wales who would disagree with me.   TL; DR: not particularly bothered, I do not feel underrepresented by the union jack."
Wales,1zplq4,Joe64x,-1,Thu Mar 6 11:55:04 2014 UTC,"Sorry to press for an answer, but why don't you feel underrepresented? Looking at the flag reeks of Welsh under-representation. I should also add that I am not from Europe, but my entire heritage is European - so, coming from an outsider this is how it appears to be for Wales by many non- Welsh."
Wales,1zplq4,ka6emusha,3,Fri Mar 7 05:35:23 2014 UTC,"I don't know, I just don't really mind. We have our own flag. And it has a dragon on. So I am just happy with our flag :)  I do like the union jack too and I feel that is represents Britain, which wales is a part of. But we have our own flag anyway!"

Wales,1yqq0f,wjw75,3,Mon Feb 24 12:26:40 2014 UTC,"Google translate has limited intergration with other programmes, this Microsoft service is likely to bridge that gap and hopefully be more accurate than Google (which is ok for basics, awful for accurate grammar).   If you don't want to use the service, then simply don't. There are people in Wales who would/will use this service and they shouldn't be penalised because of your very clear prejeduce towards the language. 99.999% of the people will find zero use in it - no hint of exaggeration there at all. I'll wager you're one of those people who continusouly leave bilious comments on Walesonline articles relating to the Welsh language - spewing off the usual cost, dead language, bilingual road-signs, duplicated bills arguments ad nauseum.

He had been working in the states for more than a decade and had never met someone here that could pick up on the differences and actually knew that the UK was more than just London. ;)

I gave a bottle of cologne or something to the first guy who caught it because I was completely floored that he got it after only a couple of sentences.  Nicely done for recognising!

Wales,1y97ku,clarityat3am,5,Tue Feb 18 21:48:53 2014 UTC,"The problem with that is that seemingly so few people understand there's a difference.

Wales,1xxovz,mattimas,11,Fri Feb 14 22:24:20 2014 UTC,Conwy. Definitely without a shadow of a doubt conwy.  The Conwy Castle IS Conwy.  You're not staying in a town that has a castle.  You will feel like you are in the castle. Caernarfon is a big touristy place with far more chavs and weirdos.  Conwy has a population of like 14. You'll have direct access to the north wales cycle path as well.  So Llandudno with the pier and great orme is minutes away. If you are not a psychopath - I would be happy to show you around and introduce you to tons of people across the coast. I have friends in pretty much every town between flint and holyhead
Wales,1xxovz,metalmorgan,3,Fri Feb 14 23:35:08 2014 UTC,Awesome! Thanks so much for the reply
Wales,1xxovz,pooinmyloo,5,Sat Feb 15 00:08:00 2014 UTC,"Although I agree with the gentleman above Caernarfon castle is pretty impressive too. I live somewhere between them both, not far from Bangor, but tend to spend more time in and around Conwy as it is a pretty town and has more going on.   Caernarfon has had a bad reputation in the past, and has had something of a nationalist reputation with the locals, but that's in the past and shouldn't stop you from visiting. Pop over to Beaumaris too, which is about a 30-40 minute bus journey from Bangor, as the castle there with its moat is also impressive. If you're heading East to Conwy then further on you have Rhuddlan, Gwrych (near Abergele) and Bodelwyddan all within 30 minutes bus journeys. Trains might be easier between Caernarfon and Conwy, but from Conwy to the others mentioned (other than Beaumaris which is on Anglesey) the local buses would be your best bet and they travel fairly regularly."
Wales,1xxovz,Boyuki,1 point,Sat Feb 15 09:55:26 2014 UTC,Conwy also has the smallest house in Wales.
Wales,1xxovz,KaiserMacCleg,3,Sat Feb 15 13:05:04 2014 UTC,"Both Conwy and Caernarfon are lovely places, and quite similar in character. I don't recognise the distinction that /u/metalmorgan draws - they're both touristy places, and everywhere in Britain has it's fair share of chavs.   Conwy probably has more of interest within the town - in addition to the castle you've got Plas Mawr and Aberconwy House, plus naff little attractions like the smallest house in Wales. Caernarfon has the Welsh Highland Railway and some nice views across the Menai.  Both towns have interesting hinterlands - /u/metalmorgan mentioned Llandudno and the Great Orme, but there's also the rest of the Conwy valley, all of which can be reached by train. Caernarfon, on the other hand, is on Snowdonia's doorstep - there are even buses that will take you right to the base of Snowdon if you fancy climbing the mountain.  If you're not using a car, Conwy will be easier. All Caernarfon has by way of public transport is buses (unless you count the aforementioned railway). In Conwy, you've got the added flexibility of a proper train station in the town. Of course, the other side of that particular coin is that Conwy is almost invariably busier than Caernarfon."
Wales,1xxovz,welshdragon2011,1 point,Sat Feb 15 11:25:57 2014 UTC,"If you REALLY want to see both, you can do Caernarfon in the morning, then catch the X5/5X and see Conwy in the afternoon, You also get to see some splendid scenery as the bus twists around the mountainside/cosatal route of the A55. I'd recommend doing it in that direction as the A55 heading the other way is in tunnels. and is a bit more boring, also don't get the 5, as it will take you round and round. You can buy a Red Rover at (i think) £6.95, or a 2 zones North Wales Rover for £10.  You ideally need more time to see the all the castles here, as there's quite a few (including a few that are a bitch to get to by public transport), Dolweddylan comes highly recommended, as does Ruthin, There's also castles in Harlech and Rhuddlan."

Also, nearby are places like Llandudno which has a fantastic atmosphere and a little place called Deganwy - there's not much there but it has a fantastic beach with views of the castle and the mouth of the estuary, definitely worth a stop to take some pictures (this is on the Llandudno line).

There are some awesome rooms inside the Victorian mansion in the castle - particularly the arab room. Castell Coch is another architectural gem right on the northern edge of Cardiff, built by the same master architect and for the same family as the Victorian part of Cardiff Castle.  The National Museum is pretty awesome. It's not huge, but it's got a wonderful collection of impressionist paintings, together with exhibits on Welsh history and geology. St. Fagans, as mentioned by others, is a part of the same organisation and is a large open-air museum consisting of a number of buildings which have been moved from all over Wales and reconstructed stone by stone within the museum. Some are really cool, such as St. Teilo's church, the inside of which is covered with restored medieval wall paintings. Gives you an idea of what British churches used to look like before Protestantism came along and ruined everyone's fun."

But, if we win it doesn't matter how ugly it is.   I feel that today we played very badly both tactically and discipline wise. But, I don't think Preistland is an international 10. Hook is a lot better and should have been on for this game. I am also a Scarlets fan, and for us Preistland is amazing, but, for Wales he seems to be missing something"

He wasn't responsible for our lack of answer to the Irish maul, he wasn't responsible for Lydiate going in on the side continuously which cost us 3 penalties and acres of territory in the space 10 minutes, he wasn't responsible for Warburton's inability to sort the forwards out for conceding endless penalties, he wasn't responsible for our failed lineuouts, or the knock ons, or the criss-crossing.   People like using Priestland as a scape goat but in reality he's had a good couple of games. It's a predictable gameplan and our failure to offer anything different that happened."

Wales,1x3jpk,jed2191,3,Thu Feb 6 01:17:32 2014 UTC,"The problem is that much of the industry power here declined rapidly in the 1980's, there are museums in most of the larger towns in the valleys but you'll notice they're not the huge industrial towns they used to be and alot of the large impressive structures are no longer here. (e.g. Crumlin Viaduct)  Trains from Cardiff Central train station will take you up to Merthyr, Trehebert, or Aberdare via Pontypridd, and Ebbw Vale via the Caerphilly Line. Pontypridd has a small town museum which is quite interesting but will probably take you no longer than about 15-20 minutes to look around!  As /u/Fyenwyw mentioned, the Big Pit is really interesting, definitely worth visiting if you're able to travel there. I've lived in Pontypridd for 3 years now (originally from North Wales) and have done a bit exploring, plenty of nice walks to go on. Dare Valley Country Park is really nice in the summer for example.  It is also worth mentioning, there is the negatives to living in the valleys. high unemployment rate, drug problems and poor school attendance to name a few. A very working class area. Of course though, what happens when towns and villages are founded around a huge industry that fizzled out to almost nothing in less than ten years? No jobs."

Like a tattered painting – or any other similarly unwieldy metaphor. Although the setting and the format are familiar, there is often something joyously abrasive about the chap known otherwise as Huw Evans.  If Hawkline isn't ploughing a completely lone furrow, he makes it seem as if he is. 'Cric Yn Y Cymylau' is sublime loner pop, the sound of a wild young man with dirt under his fingernails. Pastoral psych folk winds away while his deep vocal quivers along a cracked melody.  There is a little of the superbly bitter and cathartic as he yells ""beth sy'n bod?""

Wales,1wqe37,cedrickirk,-8,Sat Feb 1 16:53:50 2014 UTC,"The welsh: They're just the Irish that couldn't swim...  Although Anthony Hopkins is welsh, he’s never been accused of sheep shagging.  It’s all down to the silence of the lambs.  Have you heard about the festival celebrated by welsh Muslims?  It's called Ramalamb  I went to Cardiff last week and had a run in with the Taffia, the welsh contingent of the Mafia;   They made me an offer I couldn't understand...     An Englishman, welshman and west indian are in hospital, waiting for their wives to give birth. There is quite a bit of pacing up and down when the nurse comes out and happily announces that they are all fathers of bouncing baby boys.  ""There's just one problem,"" she says. ""Because they were all born at the same time, we got the tags mixed up and we don't know which baby belongs to whom. Would you, as their fathers, mind coming to identify them?"" The men agree and walk into the delivery room and look at the babies.  Immediately the Englishman stoops down and picks up the black baby. ""Yes, this is definitely my baby,"" he says confidently. ""Um, excuse me,"" says the west indian, ""but I think it's fairly obvious that this is my son."" The Englishman pulls him aside and says, ""I see where you're coming from, mate, but one of these babies is welsh and I'm not prepared to take the risk.""     A welshman, a sheep, and a dog were survivors of a terrible shipwreck. They found themselves stranded on a desert island.  After being there a while, they got into the habit of going to the beach every evening to watch the sun go down. One particular evening, the sky was red with beautiful cirrus clouds, the breeze was warm and gentle; a perfect night for romance.  As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the welshman. Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. But the dog got jealous, growling fiercely until the welshman took his arm from around the sheep. After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling.  A few weeks passed by, and lo and behold, there was another shipwreck. The only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the most beautiful woman the welshman had ever seen. She was in a pretty bad way when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed her back to health. When the young maiden was well enough, they introduced her to their evening beach ritual. It was another beautiful evening: red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze; perfect for a night of romance.   Pretty soon, the welshman started to get ""those feelings"" again. He fought them as long as he could, but he finally gave in and leaned over to the young woman, cautiously, and whispered in her ear...  ""could you take the dog for a walk?""    An Englishman, an Irishman, a welshman and a Scot are captured by the Iraqis. The Iraq troop leader says, ""we're going to shoot you, but we will give you one last request."" He says to the welshman, ""what's your last request?"" The welshman says, ""I want a thousand welshman singing 'Land of my Fathers'."" ""Okay, you've got it. What about you?"" he says to the Scotsman. ""I want a thousand Scots pipers piping Scotland the brave,"" says the Scot. ""You've got it"" says the Iraqi. ""What's your last request?"" he says to the Irishman. ""I want a thousand Irishman doing the Riverdance"" says Paddy. ""It's yours"" says the Iraqi. Turning to the Englishman, he says, ""and your last request?"" The Englishman says, ""fucking shoot me first""."

Always wanting to be different, and preferring the underdog, I went with Chelsea and Swansea.   It was great when I passed my driving test, I would travel down to the vetch and watch us play teams like Yeovil and Tranmere, not having a clue where these places were.   I wish we could be far more civalised football fans. I have a lot of friends who support Cardiff and would love to see the day we could walk to a derby game together, like you see in Merseyside.   I went to watch us play saint gallen in Switzerland in December, half our ""fans"" spent most of the game facing the wrong way singing anti Cardiff songs, didn't even watch the match. ( although in their defence you could only see half the pitch due to fog and when you could see us with the ball we were shit).

The Englishman keeps chickens in his garden and one night a chicken hops over to the fence to the Welshman's garden and lays an egg. The next day the Welshman returns the Englishman's chicken but claims the egg as his as it was laid on his property.   The Englishman disagrees and reasons that it was his chicken as therefore the egg belongs to him. The Welshman suggests that they settle the matter by the age old tradition of a ""welsh kicking competition"". The Englishman has never heard of this so the Welshman tells the Englishman to go into his house and slip on a sturdy pair of shoes and return to the garden.  When the Englishman returns in his sturdy boating shoes the Welshman is wearing his tough steel toed mining boots. The Welshman then explains the rules. They both take turns to kick each other in the testicles as hard as they can, and the loser the first one to give up. The Englishman sounds apprehensive but agrees. The Welshman then explains as it was his garden that he should go first. He then takes a big running start and hoofs the Englishman in the nuts as hard as he can. The Englishman drops to the ground in agony and writhes around on the ground for 15 minutes. He finally gets to his feet and says that it's his turn, only for the Welshman to reply ""Nah, you can keep the egg!"""

As for Cardiff, what my boyfriend and I did last summer was visited the castle and then spent a couple of hours chilling out, having a picnic and couple of drinks in Bute park (which is right next to the castle). It's a really lovely place to spend a couple of hours.   Mill lane in Cardiff is a good but obvious choice for dinner/drinks but there's lots of choice :) if I could recommend a restaurant I would say Casanova or the Potted Pig!

Wales,1uvwb6,w0ss4g3,5,Sun Jan 12 22:37:18 2014 UTC,"While in Swansea, make sure you visit the Mumbles. I'd say hiring a bike would be a good way to do it. I'd also suggest you visit the Gower, somewhere like Rhossili is nice. If you like beaches, then check out Llangennith, which is near Rhossili - great place for surfing (plenty of wetsuit/board hire and lessons nearby) and there's a good pub at Worm's head. Can't recommend places to eat beyond saying there's lots of nice places down the Mumbles - I don't tend to eat out in Swansea very often.  In Cardiff there's lots as well - the bay is really nice with plenty of places to eat/drink and you can walk/cycle across to Penarth via the barrage - lots of small shops and places to eat there. The Castle in the centre is good, but there's also Castle Coch (near Tongwnlais) to the north - you can cycle there via the Taff Trail in about 45 minutes, or drive in about 15. St Fagans is a bit of a drive away but worth a visit too. Could check out what's on (Comedy/Films, etc) at Chapter Arts Centre too.  Nice places to eat: I'd recommend a looking in Canton and Pontcanna, there's a place called Patagonia which I've heard good things about. There's also a farmers market in Riverside (over the river from the Stadium) on a Sunday which can be a good place for breakfast/lunch. If you're willing to go a bit out of the centre, there's also a few places along Wellfield Road (in Roath), including a nice Italian place (forgotten the name.. maybe Dolce Vita?) and a Tapas bar called Juno Lounge. If you like Curry, there's also loads of places along City Road.  Haven't linked to anywhere, but if you check out the places on Google maps then you'll hopefully get a feel.  Sure I've missed loads of things (e.g. The museum), but hopefully it'll give you a bit of a start!"

Wales,1ur9x3,Cwsh,12,Thu Jan 9 00:51:55 2014 UTC,"This idea that Wales cannot be a country if it is a Principality has always baffled me.   A Principality is a country (nominally) ruled by a monarch who carries the title of Prince. A few modern examples exist in Andorra, Monaco and Liechtenstein, all of which are universally recognised as countries.   I think the confusion in Wales' case stems from the conflation of the words ""country"" and ""Kingdom"" in the minds of some British people. England, Scotland and Ireland were all Kingdoms at the time they joined the Union. Wales was not - it wasn't even a Principality at that point - merely a part of the Kingdom of England. This lesser status seems to have stuck in the minds of some, which I think is the root cause of this Principality nonsense.  Being a Principality and a country at once is perfectly possible, but being a Principality and Kingdom is not. Somehow this obvious truth became twisted so that, in Wales' special case, it was decided that it could not be a country because it was a Principality (which it hasn't been since 1536 anyway)."

There's a lot of comments on here that I have to say I don't quite agree with (I've lived here for ten years and don't have a car-- you don't need one, and everywhere out of Cardiff is not equivalent to rednecks), but I'm glad there's a lot of comments to help you get a feel for the place. Keep in mind that a lot of people don't actually know this place though-- they're commenting on what they think of the place/have heard about it!  I'm American, from Pennsylvania, and came here for a semester as an undergrad. I loved it. Absolutely loved it. I had the best semester of my life on the sea, in the mountains, with friendly people, in an affordable place, with easy access via direct trains to Chester, London, Cardiff, Manchester, and Liverpool.   I came back to do my MA, stayed for a PhD in Film, and am now Dr. Maggie Parke, and the Uni hired me to help other students from North and South America come study in Wales (I also still work in film though).  So if you've questions, do drop me an email and I'm happy to set up a skype chat with you: maggie.parke@bangor.ac.uk  I'm also in the States a lot, so depending where you live I can chat with you in person, too.   And info for US students: http://www.bangor.ac.uk/international/countries/usa/  In my opinion it's awesome, but you've gotta get a feel for the place through whatever means you can. It's beautiful, safe, affordable, and a great education, especially in a few key areas.  Talk to you soon, and do let me know what other questions you guys in the reddit community might have!

Wales,1uklcd,thesleepsessions,0,Fri Jan 10 15:08:00 2014 UTC,"As someone born and bred in Wales, this is rather wrong.  A lot of Welsh people are phenomenally rude, I run a shop, and when I politely say ""I'm sorry, I don't speak Welsh"" to my customers, I often get greeted with a totally changed attitude, a huff and a puff, and then spoken at rather than to.  I have English, Scottish & Kiwi friends who visit and have tale after tale of being treated absolutely fine, until they open their mouths and are heard speaking with a different accent.  I went climbing Snowdonia last year, stopped in a pub on our way back run by a very rude man who did nothing but slag off the English, particularly those from Liverpool. When I told him my parents were scouse, he made a rude jibe at me and walked away.  I'm not saying all are, the majority are not, however there are a lot, certainly where I live, enough to make a mark and be noticed.  On the subject of road signs, I read/write/speak very little Welsh as I said, but I still think it's plain dangerous decking out road signs with the Welsh first. We, as humans, are taught to read from top to bottom, with relevant information such as roadsigns, containing what we need to quickly glance, process and act upon. Putting the Welsh first, at the top, not only means people, especially from outside of Wales, may miss crucial information, but may actually be spending LESS time looking at and concentrating on the road, searching for the translation. Just my two pennies."

I have just as much anecdotal evidence that indicates to the contrary. I can speak Welsh, but my family language is English-speaking and my parents don't have Welsh accents. I currently live in the south of England. When I was younger we travelled extensively around the country including very 'Welsh' areas of the north. Not once did we experience hostility for ordering food or drinks in English, speaking English in pubs etc. And I never heard anyone bitching in Welsh about us 'the English speakers' when we were in their presence. I feel that the tourists/English-speaking Welsh people who propagate these kinds of stories must be quite unpleasant people to have elicited such a reaction from people who were nothing but friendly to us! I'm not saying it never happens (some people certainly do hold a ridiculous prejudice towards England) , but I don't think it's half as commonplace as some people would have us believe. :S"

There probably are individuals who, in certain situations, will feel aggreived at their inability to use Welsh to procure a service of some kind. Hell, if I was an old cymro cymraeg from Aberteifi who recalls a time when he could walk into any shop and converse with the guy behind the till in his native language, maybe I would also be peeved from time to time that that is no longer possible.

Not as long as English is a minority language.   Welsh speakers often converse among their friends purely in Welsh and do so every day.   Yes, and this is normal and fine. But we're not talking Welsh about Welsh to Welsh interactions, we're talking Welsh to English."

Speaking in the presence of doesn't imply having a conversation with.  Yes, someone who continued to speak to you in Welsh despite realising you cannot speak it would be exceptionally rude, not to mention stupid. But I have never seen or heard, nor can imagine, that happening. Has it ever happened to you or are you trying to associate a hypothetical example of rudeness to all Welsh speakers so that you can call them rude in order to justify some sort of prejudice?  In fact:   getting upset when someone only knows [English]   Who has got upset over this?   If a person who speaks both languages of Wales chooses one to deliberately to not be understood, they are being rude.   I don't think this ever happens?

It's also a shame how I started off in a Welsh nursery but had to move to an English one because the Welsh one wasn't free.  I wish I bothered to learn in school and I also wish it was my first language. Teaching myself is out of the question and everybody I know who went to a Welsh school never uses Welsh and has since forgotten a majority so they cannot help teach me.

English is not a Welsh language; Welsh is the native language of the Welsh people. So do you feel embarrassed when speaking English in Wales? English is also an official language in India. So is India too an exception?   it is a historic language, and should be kept one   Except that it has about 750,000 speakers today, and that number is growing. Welsh literature is being published daily, Welsh is being spoken daily, and there is a rich cultural history confined to that language. If the Welsh language dies so does much of the Welsh culture, and thus the spirit of the Welsh people. I'm proud of my culture, and I wish for my children to grow up in a world where that culture continues to thrive and is not engulfed through law by another culture which has tried to strangle my culture throughout history. I want it to live side by side with British culture, and it can.  Wales is a bilingual country, and in my experience anyone you come across will be happy to speak with you in English if you don't know the native language of Wales. Simply because someone else doesn't know the language does not restrict your right to use it with other people who do. English speakers are not outcasts in Welsh society; how is the use of my own tongue with other speakers of it rude?"

By the 2011 cencus, it dropped to 19%.  The Welsh language should be fought for! I won't deny that. It is our national identity. But it is also a novelty rather than a necessity for most if not all of the Welsh population. Even my friend below who speaks Welsh and French as first languages speaks English fluently and doesn't know why.  The question is: is Welsh an official language of Wales because it is an essential language in Wales? Or is it to cling on to the language as heritage.  Welsh is an ancient language, so who decided on the Welsh for Bus, Ambulance, Police officer given that these didn't exist when the Welsh language was mainstream?"
Wales,1uklcd,slicksps,1 point,Tue Jan 7 13:09:27 2014 UTC,"is Welsh an official language of Wales because it is an essential language in Wales? Or is it to cling on to the language as heritage?   Well... Yes to both of those. I believe ""clinging on"" to Welsh as a piece of our national heritage is essential. Welsh is the language of Wales. Because it is an old language, because it is a living language, and because of the mass of knowledge and culture in that language; that is why it is worth fighting for, as you said. This is why people still speak different languages today, no? If the preservation of languages is not 'essential' we might as well all start speaking one language and destroy the culture, ideas and history of every nation.   Welsh is an ancient language, so who decided on the Welsh for Bus, Ambulance, Police officer given that these didn't exist when the Welsh language was mainstream?   Doesn't that also work with every language? I don't see the point. English saw the days when these things didn't exist. English evolved from Proto-Germanic as Welsh was evolving from Brythonic. Most innovations become borrow words from the language of the people that invented said innovation, some are drawn from the equivalent stems of the term, some are invented by natives and the rest of the world gets to play on it."

Principally from UK tourists, so it's mostly money just shifting around inside the economy. No wealth is being generated here.  And where does that money go? How much of it is used to bolster Welsh business and society?  Too many people have this dumb idea that money is the basis of economic wealth. It is not. The basis consists of energy and resources. Nothing else. So, what exactly is being paid for/bought with this 1 billion? The right to wander around and gawk at Wales' stunning scenery? Well, whoop-de-doo.

And don't miss out on our castles  For countryside, you're spoiled for choice!!!  From both Cardiff and Swansea, you can head into the Brecons for a hike or take a trip on the Brecon Mountain Steam Railway. Website or if you're feeling really adventurous take one of the many Gorge walks  From Swansea mainly (or Cardiff with a slightly longer journey) head into Gower and check out the coastline walks and views which are simply stunning.  Depending on the time of year, check calendars for special events like air shows etc.  From London, the South might be more viable for travelling times although if you can split your 4 days to see more, do."

But, with all that being said I agree with a lot of people here. St Faggans, Cardiff Museum, The Gower, The Welsh/English border towns along The Offa's Dyke trail, Machynlleth... I could go on.

Wales,1t6gvv,farcehole,2,Sun Dec 22 16:40:47 2013 UTC,People who speak welsh but do not know words for some things can use a english word instead . Some times this English word is used as is but other times the word is modified to sound welsh. This sometimes done by putting a io at the end of a word.like if you said you wanted to drill something .in welshlish (Welsh  English mash up) dwi isio drillio wrbath . Drillio is drill with io on the end to make it sound welsh
Wales,1t6gvv,welshdude1983,1 point,Wed Dec 25 13:18:02 2013 UTC,An English colleague of mine says that use of the word 'row' to mean being told off rather than as a synonym for argument is a peculaiarity of Welsh English. Pronouncing 'tooth' with a short 'oo' as in 'foot' instead of the long one found in 'loose' is apparently a Welsh trait too.

It used to have beautiful art-deco brass fittings everywhere, the 2 3ft women holding lightbulbs have disappeared from the bottom of the stairs it seems. It was set fire to twice about a year after it closed. It is a listed building and a developer would only be able to knock it down and develop the site if it was allowed to rot in exactly the way it seems to be rotting right now. The reason for its closure was the 'international sports village' being built in Spitty, meaning the residents and school swimming classes of Victoria, St. Julian's, Beechwood and Maindee would need to travel to an out-of-town industrial/retail area by bus to get a swim."

Wales,1sos9v,realjd,8,Thu Dec 12 03:05:26 2013 UTC,"As far as restaurants and pubs go, Zerodegrees is a great place that combines the two. They brew their own beer on site (the mango beer is a must-try) as well as doing amazing food. It's just across the road from the Millennium Stadium too which is worth seeing, it's one of the largest rugby stadiums in the world. If you happen to be in town on a rugby day, I would urge you to go and watch a game here. Rugby is a huge part of Welsh culture, and the Welsh are very proud of their team. It'd be expensive but well worth the money.  Just down the road from Zerodegrees is another great pub, Urban Tap House. They have a huge collection of beers and a great atmosphere.  If after a few beers you fancy a dance, you should visit Clwb ifor bach which is on the same street. It's the only nightclub in the world where barstaff are required to be fluent in both English and Welsh. They have 3 floors, each playing vastly different music, so you can mix and match between genres.   As far as tourist-y stuff goes, the castle is definitely worth a look, and the museum is pretty interesting. Also make sure you have a stroll around the Arcades. There's a lot of independently owned shops, including Spillers Records which has a claim to being the oldest record store in the world.  Hope this has been helpful, feel free to ask any questions if you have them.  I've lived in Cardiff for almost four years now, and I absolutely love it here. It's a shame you guys can't stay longer! Hope you enjoy your travels."

Wales,1sos9v,theterminizer,7,Thu Dec 12 14:08:26 2013 UTC,"American here who was recently in Cardiff. Will you have a car? Caerphilly Castle is pretty remarkable, but a bit of a drive. I'm an old architecture/urban history nerd, so I loved seeing the Coal Exchange building on the waterfront, and that's right by the Millennium Centre so worth a visit. I walked around Cardiff Castle but didn't go in because I'd already been in the UK two weeks by that point and had my fill of paying to go inside castles, unfortunately it's not very interesting from the outside as it's hidden inside the walls."
Wales,1sos9v,Kitchner,3,Thu Dec 12 05:30:45 2013 UTC,"Yeah I have to recommend the castles as well.  Caerphilly is actually my favourite castle (despite being from Cardiff) as it is what I call ""a proper castle"". You look at it's design and everything about it is designed to kill people trying to get in.  Cardiff Castle on the other hand has a lot of interesting rooms with a lot of gold leaf paint, and an interesting history. As it was used as essentially a stately home for a while though it's not really as ""combat"" looking as Caerphilly.  So Cardiff Castle has more history, but Caerphilly is a better example of castles as they were used in war."

The views from the Gurnos on a good day is stunning, but it is mostly to be found wrapped in mist/fog/rain. Keep an eye out for the chippy in Treherbert, makes me laugh every time.  Also Cardiff Museum has a great collection of impressionist paintings and The Museum of Welsh Life in St Fagans is fan on a nice day."
Wales,1sos9v,schmung,1 point,Thu Dec 12 14:24:12 2013 UTC,"Yes, the Penderyn distillery.   I found Treherbert on the map. Taking the back roads through there would be a nicer drive than the A470 then? I'm always up for taking a slower route (at least one way) if it's more scenic."
Wales,1sos9v,hansolo2843,2,Thu Dec 12 16:04:51 2013 UTC,"Drive as quickly as you can through the Gurnos though, place is a shit hole, but if you are up that way check out Morlais castle, the steam railway, the viaduct and Cyfarthfa castle.  The back roads are nicer but the A470 between Merthyr and Brecon is pretty spectacular."
Wales,1sos9v,moz_1983,1 point,Thu Dec 12 17:40:53 2013 UTC,"It is really stunning, whatever the weather and at maximum it may add about half an hour to the journey. I lived in the sates for 6 months and the distances were pretty mind boggling, here, it's kind of small and I am no big fan of the A470. Have a look on google maps, the idea of a big country is kind of relative when faced with the drive up to the Rhigos.  Iachi da."

You've got a 'proper' pub in the form of the packet and a couple of decent-ish restaurants.   I'd head into town though, there's a fair bit more there. For drinking I like 10ft Tall, the City Arms, The Rummer. My personal favourite restaurant is the Thai House, though it's not cheap it is good. Have also heard good things about Bills, but not been myself yet.  If you are going to the Penderyn distillery then there are a few decent gastropubs in that neck of the woods as well."

Wales,1rnu6q,nigelwyn,1 point,Thu Dec 5 15:19:09 2013 UTC,"The third one looks a bit like Queen Street perhaps, or the street that now has all the expensive shops on the other side of St Davids. The fourth might be the museum by the civic buildings in Cathays. I'll try and find out for you!"

Here is a slightly blurry photo of him from the same tour riding a donkey in Carthage.   This is blurry because I was taking pictures of pictures with my phone and I couldn't get a good shot of it, but the back reads ""Cardiff Castle"". Perhaps you can confirm or deny."

Wales,1rcj10,roddymcrodrod,2,Sun Nov 24 18:34:21 2013 UTC,Seems pretty easy if you leave Cardiff just before 9am bus stops right outside. Shame the First Call buses don't take the Network Rider.

Stop at Caerphilly castle, drive up over the Rigos mountains, enjoy the amazing views and then head to the distillery. It's a great day! The tour is cheap, and includes ""2"" tastes, but the two times I've been we have been able to convince the tour guide to let us sample more. I was there we convinced the hot tour guide to let us try everything...it was a good start to our day at 10am haha!"

Wales,1r266h,BenakaGinge,2,Wed Nov 20 14:33:07 2013 UTC,"It doesn't do much to dispel the image of footballers being overly macho, arrogant tossers does it - amateurs especially. 'Don't worry lads, just a bit of banter innit! Wahaaaaay, tits out for the lads!!!!' Etc.  For those directly responsible - throw the lot of them off the team. Socially backward morons."
Wales,1r266h,moz_1983,2,Thu Nov 21 12:09:08 2013 UTC,"The two responsible have been banned from all sporting activities, the students union and any recreational facilities associated with the university for their remaining time at Cardiff. They're lucky they haven't been kicked out altogether. The rest of the club are banned for two weeks and have been pulled out of this year's Varsity fixture, which is basically the highlight of their year.  General consensus seems to be that the two that put on the presentation did so without the knowledge of anyone else present, but the football club and the dance group at the social have both been criticised for not intervening or reporting the incident themselves. I'm not sure if the university officials are actually aware but the presentation was apparently made for the football club's tour last year, so it wouldn't have been new for some of the people there.  Having a brief involvement with the club last year in a playing capacity only, I can safely say that it was only a matter of time before something like this happened. From the initiation ceremonies to the socials, too many of them are nothing but trouble, and are a danger not only to themselves, but to others as well. I can't even remember how many establishments they got banned from as a club or as individuals last year, but all of the bannings came about because of stupid behaviour in the name of 'banter'. Some of them actually thought it would be funny to go dressed as Jimmy Savile and abused children for Halloween last year, so it's hardly a shock that they think making light of rape is acceptable."
Wales,1r266h,Hell0Dave,0,Fri Nov 22 00:31:20 2013 UTC,It's not just football. University sports society's are a cesspit of this type of thing. I was at uni 10years ago (involved in rugby and football) and I hated it. Not surprised it's still going on.
Wales,1r266h,jimofwales,1 point,Thu Nov 21 14:07:45 2013 UTC,"I don't really know much about uni life but I've seen the local uni badminton team, I don't think they'd do such a thing like this. But nonetheless, the attitude is appalling."
Wales,1r266h,duffking,1 point,Thu Nov 21 22:49:09 2013 UTC,"Depends on the team. Football/Rugby/Hockey tend to be pretty stupid wherever you go. I went to Cardiff for my undergrad and Rugby/Football were pretty bad for it. Hockey were just a bit rowdy from memory. Just about every other club tends to be fine, IMO. It's the same story now I've moved to Bath to do postgrad. I wonder if it's just an effect of being an all-male club as opposed to being a mixed one, there's nobody there to curb to stupid LAD behaviour. But even then the IMG/departmental Football/Rugby teams were pretty fine too, aside from the medics."

How about   If you were organizing a party, would you a) go to the supermarket or b) use this service.  Then try and make your service better than going to tesco to buy loads of cheap stella.   or for when a party has been organized, and more people than expected turn up.  consider stocking BBQ supplies in summer. turn up with charcoal and lighting fluid, upsell stella and red bull.   find a way to target people who've gone home from the pub with loads of mates.   and, how is this different than sending a taxi driver to tesco then to the kebabs.   good luck, sounds like fun."
Wales,1qw70v,mininmad,1 point,Mon Nov 18 19:39:08 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, but really I'm just determining numbers likely to use. The problem with offering shed loads of different things is that much of it may not sell, still, it's a good suggestion that I will keep in mind.It should be cheaper than a taxi run by far, but then it can't be cheaper than going yourself. (costs a fortune to get a business started, never mind afloat). Most people would naturally go for a supermarket or shop as it's bound to be cheaper.  That's why businesses like this generally operate after most places have shut or early hours in the morning."
Wales,1qw70v,DownDiggyDown,2,Wed Nov 20 00:49:48 2013 UTC,post in the student room or on the university of south wales spotted page or something could get a lot of clients from there
Wales,1qw70v,DownDiggyDown,2,Mon Nov 18 20:21:25 2013 UTC,Is there actually that much demand for this type of service? I've seen many businesses offering this come and go very quickly. I'd have also thought there is a lot of red tape as well?
Wales,1qw70v,DownDiggyDown,1 point,Mon Nov 18 23:33:28 2013 UTC,"yeah there is a lot of red tape, and as to determining demand, that's what I'm currently doing. Some of these businesses do really well, but as you point out, I imagine many more fail"
Wales,1qw70v,DownDiggyDown,2,Wed Nov 20 00:47:00 2013 UTC,"That's good stuff, but bare in mind that most people (literally) who say they'll use your service actually won't. The only way you'll truly know is when they part with their money. In my opinion, the best way to find out would be to just jump straight in and do it. Have some tidy leaflets printed and distribute them (I recon this could work quite well for what you're doing, much like it does for takeaways) and invest in a few hundred pounds worth of stock to start with. Be careful not to spend to much time faffing around with to much research etc.   Keep us all updated, I'm local and also own a business so I'm really interested to see how your endeavor turns out!  Also, how old are you, OP? If you're under 25 message me and I might be able to help you out a lot."
Wales,1qw70v,moz_1983,2,Wed Nov 20 12:09:31 2013 UTC,"Hello, and thanks for the offer and advice. I agree absolutely with all that you have said. However this is a necessary evil for a business plan, that in turn is needed to secure funding. This is the most faffy part of the research, the rest has mostly been done. It would be something ideally to be started at home, but council licensing laws look likely to prevent that. As to age, I'm unfortunately over 30."
Wales,1qw70v,wjw75,1 point,Wed Nov 20 12:22:00 2013 UTC,"It would be something ideally to be started at home, but council licensing laws look likely to prevent that.   Be careful if you have to get your own premises. I know from experience that commercial leases are no fun to be stuck in (was expanding to larger premises), and the only reason I got out of one was by luck. Negotiate in as many break clauses as possible if you go down this route.   And the reason I asked your age is because there's some (fairly hidden) grants available for Welsh startups owned by 18 - 25 year olds, shame you don't fall into that range.   If you're looking for some guidance, I'd definitely recommend contacting these guys and meeting with a local business adviser (it's free). The person who helped me was brilliant and really helped with all sorts of things I might have missed."
