Melt butter and add the milk, heat to 37C/98.6F.  Add the milk and butter mix to the bowl with jeast and stir till the jeast is fully dissolved. Add the syrup. Add a little of the flour at a time while mixing (both types). Lastly add the salt and knead the dough for 5 minutes.  Split the dough into two and let it rise to double size (approximately 1 hour)  Split the dough into 32 pieces and ""rundriv"", see https://vimeo.com/5728745 .  Roll out the dough balls and prick the dough. Brush with milk to gain a golden surface.  Bake in the oven for 6 minutes at 250C/482F.  Hopefully this is understandable, translated from swedish."

Breadit,3dxjih,yarnybarny,4,Mon Jul 20 10:35:43 2015 UTC,"The problem with microwave grills is that they pretty much work like toasters, full blast until stop. Small electric ovens - with resistors in the cavity - do the same thing with an on/off switch when the thermal sensor measures the right temp.  The issue with those is that they heat things pretty much exclusively by radiation, while a conventional oven will be mostly by convection (ventilated or not). And if I understand correctly, traditional (bread) ovens do a mix of the two.  So if you get an oven with the resistors in the cavity, you'll have to shield the baking plate from it otherwise it might essentially scorch the bottom of your loaf by the time the top is cooked. A baking stone might be a good idea, personally I mcgyvered it by putting the grid under the baking (metal) plate in mine. You'll want to experiment with cooking times and temperatures as well (like with any oven actually).  But yeah, microwave? I'd say no.  Disclaimer not a professionnal baker or anything, just someone with a small electric oven which I hate and don't have room to upgrade."

I use them to cover dough as it is rising and used two others to line a wicker bowl and a plastic collander (that were both the same size).

For bread machines, I like to use a very small measuring cup and put warm 90-95 degree water, the yeast, and any small amount of sugar in it and stir it up while I measure the other ingredients. By the time you are ready to put everything in the bread machine, the yeast should be bubbling and show you that it is lively. I put the liquid in the bottom of the bread machine container (with the paddle) first and add the dry ingredients on top of that.

Breadit,3dsmr4,DJShamykins,5,Sun Jul 19 01:48:35 2015 UTC,"Spread out flat, you say? Sounds like you just had it proofing on a flat surface.   Try this next time: Make sure you have lots of surface tension when forming your loaf. You want to stretch out the top of the loaf so that the loaf springs up rathe than out when it rises. Do this by rolling the dough as you form it and stretching it around the loaf.  Get a large bowl (salad bowl, serving bowl, mixing bowl) and place a kitchen towel inside. Coat the towel in flour. Form the loaf into a round (boule), and then flip it upside down and place it inside the bowl. Let the bread rise.   Then, when it comes time to bake, invert the bowl, flipping the loaf out onto your baking sheet or peel (if you use one) and place it in the oven.   Check out this video from the Max Piolane bakeries (famous french baker, although less well-known than his late brother, Lionel) about how they make their bread. At 1:50 you can see the baker forming boules with surface tension, then placing them in baskets.   Final tip, when you preheat the oven, place a steam pan in the bottom. You can use an old baking sheet, loaf pan, or something similar. Fill it with a cup of hot water when you put the loaf in the oven. The steam from the steam pan will help the loaves brown."
Breadit,3dsmr4,gingerbreaddan,3,Sun Jul 19 05:29:23 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/6YLkBNT  Another attempt using your advice. Second rise (proof) in a bowl with a towel and flour, and a pan of water in the oven. Also I did a shorter second rise because last night it seemed to fall near the end, just before the oven. It's a bit too dense still, and didn't Brown much, but I skipped the egg brushing step."
Breadit,3dsmr4,gingerbreaddan,5,Sun Jul 19 15:11:54 2015 UTC,"That looks better!   Too dense? Might be the kneading time. The recipe calls for 8 minutes, which a super long time. That probably contributed to the density and the small, tight holes in the crumb. Try kneading it for half that time next time (but make sure the gluten is still developed and all the ingredients are absorbed).   I would suggest you knead it until the dough is tacky, but not supple. Dough texture comes in three stages- sticky, tacky, and supple. You test this by poking your index finger into the dough. If bits of wet dough stick to your finger, the dough is sticky. If no dough sticks and your finger leaves a dent, the dough is tacky. If no dough sticks and your finger impression springs back so there is no dent, the dough is supple. I suggest you knead it next time for four minutes until tacky.   It looks like the loaf was starting to brown, but didn't have enough time in the oven. This bread needs to bake for longer. Do you happen to have a meat thermometer? Next time, try baking until the internal temperature of the loaf (measured by sticking the thermometer in the side of the loaf toward the middle) reaches 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96 C).   Try those tips and see how it goes."
Breadit,3dsmr4,gingerbreaddan,4,Sun Jul 19 15:22:02 2015 UTC,You are so damn helpful.
Breadit,3dsmr4,gingerbreaddan,2,Sun Jul 19 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"I've been told kneading up to 15 minutes is possible with some breads, how come this one is so short?"
Breadit,3dsmr4,gingerbreaddan,2,Sun Jul 19 16:14:03 2015 UTC,"Some breads need a long knead. When I do cinnamon rolls, I go for tacky dough. It just depends on what kind of bread you are trying to bake. A sweet bread with a lot of added sugars or oils (like a cinnamon roll) typically has a denser crumb by design. Artisan loaves that are just flour, water, salt, yeast, and sometimes olive oil typically aim for a more open crumb, so you knead it a lot less. I make a ciabatta that requires about 1:30 mixing and kneading. It just depends on the type of crumb you want."
Breadit,3dsmr4,gingerbreaddan,2,Sun Jul 19 20:52:39 2015 UTC,"The loaf sounded very hollow when I took it out, I'll try the meat thermometer this time though.  And good beta on the stages of dough, thanks, I'll remember that one. I may well have achieved supple on all these loaves."
Breadit,3ds9mk,Not_enough_yuri,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:36:42 2015 UTC,1 cup of yeast? Hoping that's a typo haha! I use a sharp paring knife and just cut about 2 mm into the loaf after the final rise right before I throw it into the oven.

A lot of people suggest heating your cooking vessel and dropping the dough in with it hot, I've done both and honestly saw no difference crust wise.   What kind of vessel did you use?  I certainly think it would matter if you were using enameled cast iron.  It wouldn't much with a vessel that didn't have much mass.    caveat: I'm not experienced to know for sure.  edit: I see the recipe calls for pyrex.  pyrex heats up fast. hmm.  I'll have to think about this and try some of this.  Ill be looking for pyrex in thrift stores."
Breadit,3dmzco,vbaspcppguy,2,Sat Jul 18 08:24:03 2015 UTC,"Thats true about the real cast iron. I have a cast iron pot with a lid, but it's too short. In all seriousness, I'm very pleased with the crust on the bottom and I think if it were thicker it would be too much for me. I still want to try it though.  I used this ancient pasta pot we have that doesn't have any plastic on it.  Its a bit big for the job for sure, but it still turns out very good each time. Some people use pyrex bowls and make a foil hat (cause the bread will rise)... really anything you have  with a lid that is oven safe will work great, if it happens to touch the sides and crust up thicker there, that's a bonus.  Non-stick does not seem to matter, the pot I use definitely isn't and the loaf just falls right out.  Keep in mind, I've made 3 loaves so far and I'm not a picky person, but I've loved my results."

My fiance doesn't like this one, it's a bit sweet for him.  Again, I halved the recipe  The King Arthur No-Knead.  I noticed on the first loaves that the back of the oven was much hotter and the back left side is a hot spot, so I made the loaves slightly different sizes and put larger ones in the hot spots so they'd brown evenly.  This is literally the simplest dough recipe that I think exists on the planet, and I adore it.  I don't have a bread maker, the only special ""equipment"" we use is a wooden spoon and will power.  And being a bit obsessive when shaping the loaves."

When I can afford it I like King Arthur, and I tend to get a name brand whole wheat flour, but for my bread and all purpose flour I get whatever.  I usually only get fancy flour when I'm baking as a gift or if I'm feeling indulgent."

Breadit,3desnq,ladymoonshyne,4,Wed Jul 15 18:33:19 2015 UTC,"I will tell you it will be equally crusty...perhaps a thinner crust then you're getting in a traditional oven less shine without steam.  If you can learn how the temperature falls-off after firing, you will have more luck against a burnt crust.  In my experience, a baguette is a great first loaf in a wood fired oven as it tolerated the high temp better than say a rich dough or olive/multigrain.  I'd offer the following tip...get to know the temperatures after the oven stops burning...remember, bread in a wood oven has no burning wood in it. I make pizza at about 1000-1100f. My oven is at about 900 after 30 minutes. All coals are swept out and the door is closed to equalize the oven temperature and place add a cast iron pan near front to get hot. After 90 minutes, i open the door, sweep the hearth and damp mop it ... please read that as damp only. If I'm good on my proofing schedule, the baguettes hit the oven at about 700* and I add a cup or two of water to cast iron pan to make steam...close door. I know some spray water on oven ceiling as an alternate idea.  Just be friggin careful with the heat and how far in you reach (at these temps you smell the burn before feeling it) and the steam (worse than heat alone)!"

Breadit,3dcb25,codfish_joe,6,Wed Jul 15 03:51:46 2015 UTC,Rye flour doesn't last as long before going rancid (it's about on par with whole wheat) and the style of rye found in the NE (generally New York deli style) is pretty dependent on caraway seeds being in it.

Breadit,3dcb25,amoryamory,5,Wed Jul 15 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"I grew up in the San Jose area (since 1980) and we always had rye bread with caraway seeds from the grocery store. It was my favorite bread as a kid and still is!  Now I live in central Florida and there is both rye and pumpernickel (both the hard, dense style and the soft sandwich kind) in the grocery store.  Seems odd that LA wouldn't have it given the large Jewish population. Safeway absolutely should be carrying both name brands and house-baked rye."
Breadit,3dcb25,kziv,4,Wed Jul 15 09:21:18 2015 UTC,"FWIW, with the exception of the occasional pumpernickel bread, i'd never heard of rye bread growing up in FL. but in pittsburgh, my current city, the jewish and polish (etc) communities have introduced me to such amazingness.  i know this sub will likely encourage you to make your own, but i've never made it myself. i do know of a bulk store nearby that sells rye flour that i've been wanting to experiment with though"
Breadit,3dcb25,wishiwasAyla,4,Wed Jul 15 05:12:01 2015 UTC,"The regionality of foods and breads in particular is something that still exists, but has decreased with time. The deli style rye bread with caraway seeds is something that comes from Northern/Eastern European traditions. If you didn't live in those places or in an area with a lot of immigrants from those places, it is unlikely you will find that bread.   Another example of this is bagels and bialys. Nowadays you can get a bagel pretty much anywhere, but it's much harder to find a GOOD bagel. Just a few decades ago you literally could not get a bagel unless you lived in say, Brooklyn. There just wasn't anyone baking them."
Breadit,3dcb25,apreche,2,Wed Jul 15 12:06:45 2015 UTC,"Of course. Rye is a cold weather grain; it does well in northeastern climates, and, perhaps more importantly, hails from Baltic areas. It is the bread of many eastern european nations, from Poland to Ukraine to Estonia, and the strong crossover between Eastern European immigrants and Jewish immigrants in NYC—many of them being both—and the strength of farming the grain in the region led to the creation of the ""New York Rye."" Globalization helps this kind of stuff spread, of course, but the origins are in Eastern Europe and the Northeastern US. It stands to reason that the farther you get from those regions, the harder chance you'll have for finding rye bread.   (I also believe rye is a commonly used grain in the Nordic countries as well as Iceland.)"
Breadit,3dcb25,adremeaux,2,Wed Jul 15 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"Rye isn't difficult to find but it may not be at the local grocer. Since LA has a decent deli culture Rye is definitely known out here and I've definitely seen it at places like trader joes if there isn't a decent bakery nearby where you are.  You can also go to Langers and pick up some fantastic rye, just ask for a loaf of the once baked and when you get it home bake it again.  edit - Add costco to the list, went down the bread aisle today and I could smell it before I saw it."

Breadit,3dcb25,batmansavestheday,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:00:32 2015 UTC,"Foods in particular still tend to be a regional specialty because a lot of the time they're tied to the culture of the area. In my area of Texas (and some midwestern states such as Nebraska, Iowa, & Wisconsin), kolache & klobasniky are unbelievably popular because of the Czech immigrants that settled here in the 1800's, but you're not going to find them in great abundance anywhere else in the US. Rye is definitely in the same boat, I think, at least if you want a good example of one. Maybe you should consider going to a NY or Jewish style deli and try your luck there?"

The original recipe (with my changes and adjustments after the strike-throughs):  1 package active dry yeast 2 1 1/2 cups warm whole milk + 1/2 cup warm water (approximately 100° to 115°) 2 tablespoons sugar honey 1/4 cup melted butter 1 tablespoon salt 5 to 6 4 to 5 cups all-purpose flour 1 egg white, lightly beaten (optional)  Add the yeast to 1/2 cup of the warm milk water, along with the sugar honey, and stir well until the yeast is completely dissolved. Allow the yeast to proof. (The mixture will swell and small bubbles will appear on the surface.) Place the remaining milk, the melted butter, and the salt in a bowl, or in an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Stir in the flour, 1 cup at a time, with a wooden spoon (if mixing by hand.) After the third cup, add the yeast mixture. Continue stirring in flour until the mixture is rather firm, which should take about 4 to 5 cups.  Remove the dough to a floured board or countertop and knead for a few more minutes, even if you have used an electric mixer, until it is supple, satiny, and no longer sticky. You may have to add more flour. Butter a large bowl and place the dough in it, turning to coat all sides with the fat. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Deflate the dough by punching it firmly two or three times, return to the floured board, and knead 4 to 5 minutes more. Divide into two equal parts and shape into loaves. Butter two 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pans and place a loaf into each. Cover and let rise again until doubled in size. This may take anywhere from 40 minutes to 1 1/4 hours, depending on the warmth of the space and the way you have worked the dough. Don’t rush the process, and watch the dough carefully.  Preheat oven to 400ºF.  Slash the tops of the loaves width-wise two or three times with a sharp knife and brush lightly with the beaten egg white. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until the bread sounds hollow when tapped with the knuckles. Remove the loaves from the pans and put them in the oven a few minutes longer to become crisped (I find the loaves are crisp enough after the baking)."

Breadit,3d4nw3,Bigfred12,2,Mon Jul 13 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"Use a stiffer starter. It will ferment slower, allowing for more flavor development."
Breadit,3d4nw3,Mister__Crowley,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:55:14 2015 UTC,I thought the key to getting the flavour in this one was rye flour.
Breadit,3d4nw3,dubastot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:13:30 2015 UTC,I did half the recipe for one loaf. Used a cast iron skillet with a foil pan cover.    stretch and fold should be at shorter intervals during warmer weather.  should let it rest longer that 30m after preshaping.  can I use plastic wrap for proofing? It stuck to the towel which I thought had more than enough flour.  Retarded overnight then took it out in the morning for room temp proofing.  The bread was moist 3 hrs after. Maybe wait a day to let it dry out.
Breadit,3d4nw3,troissandwich,2,Mon Jul 13 14:33:18 2015 UTC,"Use a towel with rice flour, it makes all the difference. If you retard overnight you don't really need to let it warm up, you can put it right in the oven."
Breadit,3d223x,ilessthan3math,3,Sun Jul 12 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"Proofing depends on a number of factors.  If the yeast is getting the job done faster, there's no need to wait around.  Looks like good bread for PB & J and/or french toast!"
Breadit,3d223x,dufus69,2,Sun Jul 12 22:34:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yea I think it will be good for that kind of stuff.  I just feel like proofing is so difficult to judge, especially when my numbers seem to suggest it being so much lower (like half) of what the recipe says.    Not sure why there is so much variability.  Temp here is 78F, within the range of what the recipe says it should be.  I fermented it in the fridge for the first 5 minutes since it was warming up as the day went on. Work in progress, I guess."
Breadit,3d223x,lackofcoherence,2,Sun Jul 12 22:49:55 2015 UTC,"So I was using the 'Beginner Tutorials - aBreaducation' recipe on the sidebar.  First attempt I didn't read it right and used wheat flour.  It completely deflated in the oven and looks like banana bread-sized.  Second attempt was this morning, which used the correct ingredients but still ended up deflating, specifically as soon as i touched it to brush on the water before putting it in the oven.  This last attempt I did a few things slightly differently and proofed it less.  I feel like it always proofs in like an hour though compared to the suggested 90-120 minutes?"
Breadit,3d223x,Little_birds_mommy,2,Sun Jul 12 22:20:58 2015 UTC,Can you give your exact recipe? I've tried baking bread dozens of times and it's never come out right.
Breadit,3d223x,ninetwosevenfour,3,Mon Jul 13 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"The recipe I used is this one from the sidebar of this subreddit.  The only alterations I made to it were that I was having trouble with the dough sticking to my hands REALLY bad during the 'Mixing' step, so during the first mixing of ingredients I never used my hands, I just whipped it with a wooden spoon until I felt it was good and mixed (a couple of minutes of beating it).  Other than that, I tried to follow the recipe to a 'T'.  which resulted in my first bread collapsing because I think it got overproofed.  On this one (which I still don't think came out as good as I'd want it to), I did the 'Final Proof' for only 1hr10min instead of the 1hr30min-2hr that the recipe suggested.  That worked better for my particular loaf."
Breadit,3d17tr,prophet178,7,Sun Jul 12 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"I've had some trouble with the last couple loaves I've baked. I've been experimenting with semolina and whole wheat with less than stellar results. I was convinced that the main issue is the baking temperature, as I've been putting the loaves in just as it preheated to reduce the amount of time the it needs to be on.  I decided to go back to the basic country white to confirm my hypothesis. The results are fantastic, yielding one of the best loaves I've ever baked.   Recipe:    Ingredient Percentage    All Purpose Flour 60%   Bread Flour 30%   Whole Wheat Flour 10%   Water 78%   Levain 20%   Salt 2.1%    Schedule:    Task Time Elapsed    Feed Levain 11pm -   Mix Dough 10:30am 11.5hrs   Autolyse 11am 30min   Divide 2pm 3hrs   Bench 2:15pm 15min   Proof (fridge) 10:15am 20hrs   Bake 11am 45min    Now back to chasing that semolina..."
Breadit,3d17tr,SonicBoom16,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:06:04 2015 UTC,"those both look awesome.  What's been your issue with the semolina and ww? both definitely require more water more than a country white loaf. If your issue is a dense crumb, maybe a touch more water is the answer.  also for ww (not sure about semolina), the rise is definitely faster than with white flour. If you're using a high percentage of ww, overproofing wouldn't be entirely out of the question based on your relatively long rise times (which i generally prefer, just noting that it does bring you a touch closer to overproofed territory)"
Breadit,3d1f61,pixelrebel,7,Sun Jul 12 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"Here's your answer.  I know that some French bakeries use diastatic malt powder. It contributes greatly to flavor, crust, and crumb.. but I sort of think of it as ""cheating"". :P Also, I disagree about using flour with a higher protein content. You should go LOWER. The finer/more delicate it is, the better. I always get a light crumb, and I use a 11% protein flour.   Also, common misconception, Type 55 isn't really an indication of protein percentage, but ash content. That's how French flour is classified, so... technically there's a 55 for cakes, and 55 for breads... etc.   You should never, ever, under any circumstance, use flour that's higher than 12.5% protein for a French bread recipe.

Breadit,3d1f61,tismith,2,Sun Jul 12 22:18:20 2015 UTC,I use diastatic malt at times. I use a very small amount - around .25% by bakers percentage (2.5g for 1000g flour)  Edit: I should also say that I'm not sure of the differences (if any) between dried malt extract and diastatic malt...

Breadit,3d1f61,boxxar,12,Sun Jul 12 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"According to this type 55 is what you are currently using if you're using all purpose flour in the US.  So you'd want type 405 if it's German, 45 if 'tis French, or 00 if it is Italian.  As the article notes another problem may be that supermarket flour is ""often old, lacking in taste and natural enzymes, and, most important, not very useful for bread baking.""  Granted the article author is from Holland, and maybe his grocer is a bad apple, but you may have to go to a baker for your flour."

Furthermore that table is nearly useless in my opinion, because an italian type 00 flour will have much more protein than a german type 405 flour. You just can't exchange flours that easily. Also, it has some facts wrong, for example german whole wheat flour has no type per definition.  (I'm german)"

Breadit,3cuij4,oddible,4,Sat Jul 11 02:29:29 2015 UTC,"Actually, you'll get a softer product if you bake at a higher temp (maximum oven temperature, preheat the stone for 40 minutes, switch oven from bake to broil at the last minute) for a shorter amount of time.  The naan cook faster, so they lose less moisture.  The exterior might seem more dry, but the interior will still have lots of moisture.  Let them cool for about 10 minutes, then wrap them in plastic.  The water vapor will soften the crusts slightly."

Breadit,3cv3h1,Harvey6ft,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:47:09 2015 UTC,"Recipe slightly modified from this one from food.com.  (Note that the below recipe scaled things back to one loaf and used a different method for combining with a light loaf than suggested because the person I was making this for someone who wanted a dark and slightly less dark bread.)  Ingredients  Slightly Less Dark Half   3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 package active dry yeast 3/4 teapoon salt 2 tablespoons molasses 1/2 tablespoon butter 3⁄4 teaspoon sugar 3⁄4 to 1 cups rye flour 1 1/2 vegetable oil 1/2 cup water   Dark Half   3/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 package active dry yeast 3/4 teapoon salt 2 tablespoons molasses 1/2 tablespoon butter 3⁄4 teaspoon sugar 3⁄4 to 1 cups rye flour 1 1/2 vegetable oil 1/2 cup water   Directions   Start with the slightly less dark half.  In standing mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, salt, and yeast. Place butter in a glass measuring cup, melt in a microwave, and then add molasses, sugar, water and vegetable oil.  Heat the entire contents for about 10 seconds on high in a microwave.  Temperature should be around 110° - 115°. Add contents of measuring cup to dry mixture. Use paddle attachment to beat at low speed for 30 seconds to a minute.  If you do not have a scrapping padding, pause halfway to scrap the unmixed portions into the main paste using a rubber spatula. Increase speed to high and beat for an additional 3 minutes. Switch to a dough hook attachment and run at low to medium speed, adding 1/4 cup of rye flour until a soft dough forms. Remove and place on a flat unfloured surface. Repeat steps 1-7 for the dark half.  The only difference is to add the cocoa powder to the initial dry ingredients. Slightly knead both doughs and cut each in half. Knead each of the four parts for about 5 minutes. Shape each somewhat rectangularly and of the same size.  Use a rolling pin to decrease the height to about 1/4 to 1/2 an inch. Starting with a slightly less dark piece on the bottom, layer the four pieces on top of one another. Use your rolling pin to press the four layers together slightly.  Do not overpress. Starting at one end, roll the dough toward you.  As you reach the end, pull the corners out to maintain the angular shape of the corners. Slightly brush or spray oil on surface and slash perpendicular to the length side of the loaf.* Cover and let sit for at least an hour to rise.** Bake at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes. Let cool on a baking rack. Enjoy!   *I screwed up here in my go at it.  I didn't cover in oil and slashed after rising.  **As this is a very thick and dense dough, I'd recommend letting rise more than an hour if you want something less dense.  Notes  Sorry for the lack of a crumb pic.  I gave this away so I wasn't able to snap one.  I was told by the person I gave it to that the bread was very dense (see my earlier note about the rising) and a little sweet by most standards (probably due to the molasses), but extremely satisfying.  It tasted good without toasting and was complemented very well with butter, but especially with jam.  This was my first attempt at this sort of thing and I think I'd do things slightly different in the future (again, see my notes above), but overall everyone who tasted it was impressed."

Breadit,3cqdsu,Tallis-man,8,Fri Jul 10 06:50:14 2015 UTC,Looks to me like your oven might have been a bit cool.  Perhaps worth checking with an oven thermometer that it reaches the desired temperature.  (And did you remember to pre-heat it?)
Breadit,3cqdsu,Tallis-man,9,Fri Jul 10 00:45:41 2015 UTC,My oven is old and temperamental as hell. This is quite possible. I usually try to compensate by preheating for longer but it doesn't always work
Breadit,3cqdsu,-H__H-,6,Fri Jul 10 01:25:43 2015 UTC,"It seems worth investigating, then.  Baking of any sort is primarily science -- temperatures really matter.  Oven thermometers are very cheap and can often allow you to deduce the oven settings that will give your desired temperature.  I'd recommend getting one, working out if your oven will go up to 400F and if so how to make it do so, and then re-trying the recipe (scrupulously following the written instructions) keeping an occasional eye on the oven thermometer to check nothing's gone awry.  There might be something more subtle that's gone wrong, but I suspect the oven's at the heart of it!"
Breadit,3cqdsu,copypaste_93,4,Fri Jul 10 01:34:47 2015 UTC,Thank you. This sounds like a good idea.
Breadit,3cqdsu,gingerdicks,2,Fri Jul 10 01:47:14 2015 UTC,You might be able to improve this further if you get a large pizza stone or some fire brick to put on the lower rack - should maintain the heat better
Breadit,3cqdsu,ccsdg,2,Fri Jul 10 03:08:33 2015 UTC,and a pizza stone is the best thing ever.
Breadit,3cqdsu,gingerdicks,6,Fri Jul 10 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"Looks like the dough volume exceeded the size of the loaf pan. Did the recipe call for more than 3 cups of flour? Lots of recipes call for amounts but put in small print that you should divide the dough into multiple loaves. I have had trouble fitting some recipes in a regular loaf pan, but recently invested in a big ceramic one.   Also you may have over proofed the dough and when you applied your egg wash it was too heavy on the puffy, delicate top and made it collapse on itself. It's always better to put the bread in a little early before it crests and allow the oven to do the work."
Breadit,3cqdsu,muddy_shoes,7,Thu Jul 9 23:15:25 2015 UTC,It called for dividing the dough into two pans that were the same measurements as my pans (which I did). I only did the egg wash on one loaf and they both turned out like this. I proofed the yeast for 10 minutes and let the dough rise in pan for an hour and a half. I guess I will let the dough rise for an hour next time.
Breadit,3cqdsu,muddy_shoes,8,Thu Jul 9 23:19:20 2015 UTC,"""40 minutes"" is a nice rule of thumb, and maybe it works for the commenter, but it would absolutely fail in my kitchen.  It really depends how fast the yeast is working: how much of it you put in and how active it is (eg temperature).  My sourdough can take 1-6 hours for a final proof, or even a whole day when refrigerated!  Some of my breads take 2 days from start to finish.  Don't watch the clock, watch the dough.  Assuming you haven't left the yeast out entirely, try a poke test.  If you poke it gently and it doesn't spring back, it's already overproofed.  If it springs back immediately, it's underproofed.  You want it springing back out slowly, and then if it starts not springing back all the way, you want it in a hot oven asap."
Breadit,3cqdsu,markocheese,3,Fri Jul 10 01:43:18 2015 UTC,Thank you. I will definitely do this.
Breadit,3cqdsu,ispeakcode,2,Fri Jul 10 01:48:34 2015 UTC,Yeah an hour and a half is a really long second proof. I prefer to proof any dough I make 40 minutes the second time. It allows maximum oven spring.
Breadit,3cqdsu,ryanosaurusrex1,6,Fri Jul 10 00:08:10 2015 UTC,I had read about proofing overnight so I didn't think an hour and a half would be a big deal. I will definitely be reducing my proof time next week.
Breadit,3cqdsu,acrediblesauce,4,Fri Jul 10 00:12:43 2015 UTC,"An hour and a half isn't very long for a first rise. I think there's some confusion about what you did. Usually when doing an overnight or longer proof/ferment you do it in a cool place or the fridge. Then you reshape the loaf and proof it again in the loaf tin or whatever before baking. If your kitchen is very warm and your dough isn't very cool to start with then it's possible for that second rise to be very quick and 1.5 hours could be too long.  However, you seem to be just talking about doing just one rise directly in the loaf tin and baking straight away. Is that the case?"
Breadit,3cqdsu,Mrfazzles,3,Fri Jul 10 02:15:51 2015 UTC,Yes it is. One rise. I usually do two but it turned out that I didn't have a much time to work on it as I thought I did.
Breadit,3cqdsu,DexterMacrame,4,Fri Jul 10 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, well that's going to work against you as the rise and reshape actually does a lot of the gluten structure formation. That's kind of how no-knead breads work.  I'd say your problem are that single rise and probably a cool oven. Definitely invest a few currency units in an oven thermometer."
Breadit,3cqdsu,beebeethebulldog,2,Fri Jul 10 02:28:05 2015 UTC,I will keep better track of my time next time and I'm definitely going to invest in an oven thermometer since mine is so finicky

Breadit,3cqmrc,noccusJohnstein,3,Fri Jul 10 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"I work full time, and come home pretty late every day (on average around 8pm). I bake by splitting up the steps over several days. The flavour that develops from the long fermentation times in-between is bonus.  Day 1: Come home from work. Prepare starter, leave to ferment at room temperature overnight (5 mins)  Day 2 morning : Pop starter into fridge (10 secs)  Day 2 evening: Make dough from starter, knead and refrigerate in oiled container (I like using an ice cream tub) for bulk ferment. I use a food processor with a dough blade to knead so the entire process takes around 20 mins including cleaning up.  Day 3 evening: Punch down and shape loaf, refrigerate (10 mins + 5 mins to clean up)  Day 4: Dough should have proofed, chuck into oven and bake."
Breadit,3cqmrc,sphingx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:28:51 2015 UTC,And I'm guessing that gives you enough bread to redo the four day cycle while using what you made last Time?
Breadit,3cqmrc,sphingx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:04:32 2015 UTC,"It does indeed last beyond the 4 day cycle for me, but it you can always double the recipe and leave half of the dough in the fridge for a second batch later. I've left dough in the fridge at the bulking stage for up to 3 extra days with no problems (the bread did taste a bit more sour when I baked it though).  My problem with bread generally tends to be the opposite: finishing a homemade loaf before it grows moldy. One interesting thing I do notice about the bread I make with this stretched-out-over-several-days method is that it doesn't seem to mold as easily. The breads I used to make would mold in 2-3 days while the bread that I make now still has no sign of spoilage on day 5, which is typically when I finish a loaf XD.   It's weird. I wonder if the long fermentation periods have something to do with it?"
Breadit,3cqmrc,sphingx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:29:55 2015 UTC,That is quite neat. Hmm..  Well it may have a lot to do with it. As well as all the fridge time. Maybe kills off inside bacteria at those Times?

Breadit,3cmsy1,pancakes_15,3,Fri Jul 10 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"The heat is much more important. Steam helps a little with oven spring, but mainly it gives bread a crisp crust. The heat it is what causes the gas trapped in the bread to expand, so I wouldn't recommend steaming it.  Bread is baked at such high temperatures to allow the expansion of the gas before the starch has a chance to gelatinize, as gases are more sensitive to temperature changes than solids and liquids."

I proofed this loaf longer than the previous one, and got a real razor to score it. I think it made a difference - the crumb had larger holes and was much nicer. I also got myself a real dutch oven! Any advice/feedback is welcomed. Thanks!  Same recipe: 1000 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting  700 grams room-temperature water, divided b/c using active dry yeast  22 grams salt  5 grams active dry yeast"
Breadit,3clnf5,psychfunk,3,Wed Jul 8 21:49:28 2015 UTC,"It looks good! A lot better than my third loaf ever was. Your shaping and moulding isn't perfect (mind you, it's not half bad for a 70% hydration dough, and perfect is hard to get) but the only way to improve that is practice, so don't sweat it. The crumb looks good too. It's not under-proved, but personally, and you may disagree, I'd prove it maybe 15 minutes longer.   It looks like the bottom crust is a little darker than the top, if so add a layer or two of baking paper to the bottom of your dutch oven next time.  I've experimented with razors, scalpels, stanley blades, professional  bread blades - you name it, I've tried it for scoring bread. My current favourite is an Opinel pocket knife. The square edges on razor blades always caught on the dough - I guess I wasn't patient enough to perfect the technique. What I'm saying is, don't get stuck trying to learn a method that isn't working for you - don't be afraid to keep trying new things.  I hope I'm being helpful rather than just rude haha :)"

Breadit,3ck8ii,kenvsryu,2,Wed Jul 8 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"I was the same way as you for the first few months, then a professional baker gave me some good advice.  Keep two jars of starter, or levain.  One in the fridge and one on the countertop.  The fridge starter can be left alone for a couple of weeks without being fed (if it's a mature starter).  The room temp starter on the other hand, needs to be fed daily.  The room temp is what I always use to make my loaves from.  If I don't think i'll be baking that week, i'll just dump the room temp starter out (so I don't have to waste a bunch of flour to keep it alive) until 2 days before bake -- then i start a new room temp starter from the fridge batch.  That fridge batch will only need to be fed like once every two weeks.  Honestly, it will make your life much easier."

The more oil the softer the dough but 50 g is quite a lot and I usually stay in the 25 - 35 g range.   The liquid weight will depend on everything from the type of flour you use to the relative humidity wherever you are. Retain some of the water component and you can always add more.  Knead prove and rest as per a normal bread dough and cook in a red hot cast iron pan.  I find this dough freezes really well if you scale and shape it into balls before its first proof.

Breadit,3ci71l,ladyanneboleyn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"When i make curry i oven roast the hard/fibrous/root veggies (like cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, yams, onions, etc) and sautee the more watery veggies (zucchini, bell pepper, mushrooms) in a big skillet with just a bit of olive oil. Then throw the roasted veg in the skillet too, add chickpeas or lentils or frozen peas or tofu or whatever, stir a tablespoon or two of curry paste into some coconut milk (get the coconut milk/coconut cream in a can, not the ""coconut beverage"" stuff from the dairy section. Use more coconut milk for a more saucy curry, less for just a coating on the veggies) or coconut yogurt - the brand so delicious makes a fantastic unsweetened coconut yogurt. Pour that into the skillet and heat it on low/medium, simmer it for like 5-10 mins, then pull it off the heat and it's done! If you don't like coconut, I've also had good luck making a tomato based curry sauce, you can use canned tomatoes or fresh but if you use fresh you'll have to let it cook down longer to let some of the liquid evaporate.   You could probably skip the oven roasting part and just cook it all together in a skillet, but I like the flavor of roasted cauliflower/broccoli/taters better than steamed.   If you have a crock pot and want to make tons of curry, just throw it all in there and set it on low, and come back to it later :p"

Breadit,3cdgci,calinet6,4,Tue Jul 7 01:31:02 2015 UTC,Beautiful! I am trying to get the nerve to make a sourdough starter. Any tips for a newbie?
Breadit,3cdgci,i_blossom,4,Tue Jul 7 21:58:02 2015 UTC,Google the pineapple juice method for creating a starter. You use pineapple juice the first few days instead of water which helps you skip the smelly bacteria stage of a starter.  Edit: Here is a blog post about it.
Breadit,3cdgci,TheSeaWolf123,2,Tue Jul 7 23:44:03 2015 UTC,That's so cool. I've never heard of doing that.
Breadit,3cdgci,i_blossom,2,Tue Jul 7 23:51:33 2015 UTC,"Try different brands of whole wheat flour. I finally got a great and dependable starter from an Arrowhead Mills stone ground whole wheat. No honey or pineapple or any of that, just equal parts flour and water left open to the air for a day. You can then gradually transition it over to white flour.  It's mostly a myth that the yeast and bacteria that inoculates a starter come from the air, as I've heard it. Mostly they're yeasts and bacteria that live naturally on the wheat, which is why they're suited to fermenting wheat. So the freshness and processing of the flour you choose is the real key to starting a sourdough.  *edit: one more tip. Once you have it going strong, don't be afraid to throw it in the fridge and feed it once a week. If you forget for two weeks, it will forgive you. It doesn't have to be a burden."
Breadit,3cdgci,Syllygrrrl,2,Wed Jul 8 03:35:57 2015 UTC,Gorgeous!  Good job!
Breadit,3cdgci,Chap_man,2,Tue Jul 7 04:48:26 2015 UTC,How do you subtract the water weight out of the starter in the overall formula? My math is weak
Breadit,3cdgci,boxxar,3,Tue Jul 7 09:57:45 2015 UTC,"Well, you basicly need to know how to convert baker percentage to overall percentage. For this, you need to calculate the total dough weight in baker percentage. For a 60% hydration dough this would be 100% (flour) + 60% (water) =160%, for a 100% hydration starter it would be 200%. Now devide hydration% by that number. Thus, if you work with 60% hydration, you get 60% / 160% = 0.375 = 37,5%. Thus one kilogram of 60% hydration dough would contain 375 grams of water (if there are no other ingredients of course).  This calculation is very easy for 100% hydration, which is common. In that case you get 50% overall water content, so you can just weight out the amout of starter you would like to use, take half of that, and that's the amount of water you need to substract from the total water that you want to have in your dough in the end.  I hope this was not too confusing.  EDIT: Oh, just to make this a bit more clear: You need to do the same thing for the flour of course. So lets assume that you want to bake a 70% hydration loaf like OP. Furthermore I'm going to assume that you want to have 10% of your flour in the starter and that you want to use 500g of flour in total.  This means that you want to have 50g flour in your starter, at 100% hydration the total weight is 200%, so you need to use 100g starter. 50g of that will be water. 70% of 500g are 350g, minus 50g is 300g. The total recipe in this case would look like this:   100g starter 375g whole wheat flour 75g bread flour 300g water   (Note that both flours together are 450g and 75g is 15% of 500g)"

Breadit,3cbcxz,TheJulie,2,Mon Jul 6 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"A redditor recently asked for ideas for using spent grain, which inspired me to contact a relatively  new local brewer, who was more than happy to give me about 4 quarts of the stuff to experiment with. I turned a bunch into flour, which I've added to zucchini bread, and have made a few attempts at making bread with it. My first attempt came out very mushy and barely rose.  My second attempt  came out extremely wan looking and dense, but tasted good toasted.  Then I realized I was probably overthinking things, and turned to Mark Bittman's adaptation of Jim Lahey's no-knead recipe.    I reduced the water to 1 1/2 cups (instead of 1 5/8) to account for the moisture in the grains, and increased the salt to 1 1/3 teaspoons.  I let it sit for 18 hours, and it was beautifully bubbly.  However, it was definitely too wet, and despite hearing all of my bread mentors yelling ""No, don't add flour"" in my head, I knew it needed more.  I think I ended up adding nearly a cup more flour before it felt right.  Clearly there was a lot more moisture in those grains than I had anticipated.  Heated up the dutch oven at 450 for a good hour while the dough bench rested, baked for 30 minutes covered, 20 minutes uncovered.    It tastes incredible. The grains give it just a hint of nuttiness and an extra dimension of texture.  Now I need to make another loaf to take to the brewery so  I can try to convince them to let me start baking bread for their taproom ;)  I've also made a batch of dog biscuits using the grain which my dogs absolutely love (and they're pretty picky for being dogs)."
Breadit,3cbcxz,lscully02,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:21:18 2015 UTC,Just want to confirm you used this recipe  as the base? And did you use 100% spent grain flour? Any wet spent grain? Yours looks lovely and I'd love to try and recreate it!
Breadit,3cbcxz,lscully02,2,Mon Jul 6 17:54:26 2015 UTC,"I used this recipe:http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread  I didn't use any spent grain flour for in this particular loaf because I've found that it tends to be very hygroscopic and makes the dough dense and gummy. I used only the wet whole grain. I considered running the wet grain through the food processor because the husks can be a bit tough but the long ferment resolved the issue nicely and they were more tender than in my previous attempts. I plan to try gradually adding some spent grain flour for added flavor in future attempts but at this point I was just really eager to have a successful loaf so I stuck to only adding the whole grain.  Note that my grain was not super wet by the time I used it in this bread, not nearly as wet as the day I got it from the brewery (which was on the day they brewed, so they were very fresh). As mentioned, I had to reduce water and increase flour - even with my grains being less wet, there was a lot of excess water; if you've ever made Lahey's no knead before, you should have a good sense for how the dough should look and feel. I ended up using the slap and fold method to incorporate the additional flour."

Breadit,3cbcxz,muddy_shoes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:35:12 2015 UTC,You used the wet whole spent grain without grinding it into flour? Did you use a combination of flour and wet whole spent grain with the Bittman/Leahy recipe?
Breadit,3cb58p,Jonnyrashid,3,Mon Jul 6 15:13:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting! I have not tried this particular recipe yet, but I will. I can tell just by the level of detail that it is highly evolved and thought out; not one of those ""first attempt"" recipes.  I, too, do some experimenting with yeast batters, and the main purpose for this comment is to call attention to the wide potential of this somewhat arcane method. It is distinguished from doughs and ""no-kneads"" in that development is with higher shear mixing as opposed to kneading or folding. Lots of interesting loaves can be made that will be different from those obtained by other methods primarily in the textures that can be obtained. As will be inferred by many from your description, if desired, more complex flavor can be obtained by cutting down on the yeast and increasing fermentation time.   A thing to watch out for is that batter breads are stickier, so it's a good idea to take extra care in ensuring release from your pans-especially those with corners and angles.  Preheated cast iron usually works well. I'm sure both of us would be interested in others experiences with mixed batter breads."
Breadit,3cb58p,loose_impediment,2,Mon Jul 6 17:29:47 2015 UTC,"Here's something: I added two more tablespoons of water when I thought the 1.25 cups wasn't enough (it was in fact more ""dough-y"" than ""batter-y""). I was worried it would be dry.   This bread is so effortless though, if it's a hit with my kid, I'll make it weekly as opposed to buying the stuff from the supermarket with 100 ingredients. Complexity, I suppose, is not a major priority here."

Breadit,3cb58p,loose_impediment,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:07:50 2015 UTC,Thanks! I don't have a pullman pan. Worth it?
Breadit,3cb58p,loose_impediment,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:51:32 2015 UTC,"You bet it is. Best pan I've ever used. I've had mine over a year, It makes a larger loaf, it's heavy gauge which promotes even baking, it is coated with a nonpolar release surface which allows oil or butter to coat, but has low affinity for doughs because of their water content. It makes a more narrow loaf that yield slices that fit toasters and sandwich containers better. If you get one, just hand wash it with hand dishwashing detergent, don't put it into the dishwasher because hot alkaline dishwashing detergents will degrade the coating. I got the lid too for more square Pullman loaves, but I seldom use it. I like the round top or split top better. So don't bother buying the lid. I bought a loaf cloche from Williams Sonoma, but after trying it for awhile, I returned to using the trusty Pullman pan except for specialty loaves that won't work in an uncovered pan. Better loaves, easier cleanup, less trouble to avoid sticking."

The whole point is they deconstruct recipes, figure out how to make them better/easier then teach you how to do it at home. There is a killer baguette recipe and croissant that will blow your mind. That being said, I am not a fan of straight copy/pasting the recipe from a paid site...   Lastly, try adding in a little diastatic malt powder to the recipe pre-fermentation. It makes up for the short rise time and further develops the flavor."

Breadit,3cbvcc,accentmarkd,3,Mon Jul 6 18:27:58 2015 UTC,"Fully whole wheat bread is tricky because it tends to be very dense. However, there are a few things that stick out to me.    How hot was your water? If it's too hot, it can kill the yeast if you added the yeast directly to the water (i.e.; without adding other ingredients first to mitigate the temperature).  Additionally, that rise time seems super short.  Did you use dry yeast or instant? If you used dry, I would expect it to need a much longer rise time.  I'd expect a much longer rise time even if you used instant, though.  I'd also expect a longer cooking time for a loaf that equals over 4 cups of flour.   I did a little backtracking and it looks like the recipe came from the Duggar family; I can't seem to find too many instances of people saying they made it successfully, mostly just people saying that the recipe looks great.  I mention this because it's the first thing I look for when I hit a snag with a recipe, or if one strikes me as off.  I'm wondering if whoever transcribed the recipe left off a few key steps.  A 20-25 minute rise, no degassing, no bench rest just seems really unusual to me. Compare it to this King Arthur recipe, which seems much more typical: http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/classic-100-whole-wheat-bread-recipe.  It calls for a 30 minute autolyse, a 2 hour rise, a  40 minute cook time."
Breadit,3cbvcc,TheJulie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:06:29 2015 UTC,"To the temp: I didn't add yeast to the water directly because it wasn't called for, I mixed it all together.  The temp was the same as any other bread I've made though (hot, but not boiling, the way I was taught was it should feel like a shower hot enough that you could stay in, but is just on the border of too hot.)  The rise time did seem weird. I was super confused and assumed it was something to do with whole wheat flour since I've never used it.  I used instant yeast, but even with that it seemed too short.    Interesting.  I got it from a friend when I said I was trying different bread recipes-I have a bread maker book but not a maker, and it constantly needs things I haven't been able to get in bulk or in the local shop yet (milk powder, gluten, etc) so her recipes were all supposed to be with ingredients in my pantry.  She sent me an e-mail with a variety of things, and the other 3 I've tried turned out so she may not have tried this one yet.  I'm more confused because she is not a fan of the Duggars...so many questions will need to be answered on that front.  But thanks for confirming my suspicion that this recipe is just the worst.  I won't even worry about trying to fix it.  I will try that King Arthur one instead tonight...though I will have to finally submit and get powdered milk it seems."

Breadit,3cbvcc,lyanca,2,Mon Jul 6 19:58:57 2015 UTC,"Just FYI since you asked about proofing the yeast- if you are using instant yeast you can go ahead and mix it directly in without worry. That's what makes it ""instant"". If you had been using 'active yeast' you'd want to proof it first."
Breadit,3cbvcc,calinet6,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:55:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've only used active dry or breadmaker yeast in the past, never instant."
Breadit,3cbvcc,lefsegirl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"Active will still mix right in just fine in most cases.  If the dough rose at all, then it is probably absolutely fine.  I think you just need to bake longer and at a higher temperature. I generally do at least 45 minutes for a loaf that size, if not a full hour. The crust tastes better baked to a nice golden brown anyway.  Don't be afraid to go off recipe. There are a lot of variables in bread making, and the ones in your kitchen might be different, so adjustment is okay and not unexpected.  *edit: dang that's an unusual recipe. But I get the idea: the honey is probably going to speed up the rise, due to the extra easily fermentable sugars. But 20 minutes still seems far too short. Are you getting any rise at all, or is it just undercooked and otherwise tasty? Sounds like this would be dense but good, and may need just a tad longer rise and a tad longer bake to really shine, which is not a bad thing."
Breadit,3cb4q3,Hongxiquan,2,Mon Jul 6 15:09:24 2015 UTC,"Bannock is dead simple to make; I've used this recipe from AllRecipes: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/bannock/  I can't think of much in the way of tips or techniques aside  from making sure the oil is nice and hot before you start to fry. I do use the same technique that I use for pancakes, which is to let the batter rest for 30 minutes before cooking with it, as I find it makes the batter a bit lighter.  In Thailand, they serve their version of frybread with condensed milk. It's a decadent combination that is especially good with coffee in the morning."
