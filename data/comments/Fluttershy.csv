Fluttershy,3di15a,Reelix,3,Thu Jul 16 13:03:39 2015 UTC,"What you're describing is the difference between what artists call ""local color"" vs. actual or apparent color.  I know that at one point in time some DHX assets got leaked. I don't know if Fluttershy's model was among them, but if so, someone might know what her official local color is. Barring that, your best bet is to find a scene with the most neutral lighting you can, and just run with that. The other approach would be to collect a large, random sample of screenshots and take the median color. You don't want to use the average because that will have the effect of desaturating the color."
Fluttershy,3di15a,ponytron5000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:22:50 2015 UTC,Have you asked over at /r/MLPvectors yet? They'll probably know more about this.
Fluttershy,3di15a,MissGoldenDragon,2,Thu Jul 16 16:37:18 2015 UTC,Will do - Thanks!

Fluttershy,3atsti,MissGoldenDragon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:25:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe limit your posts to small subs like these? It drowns out all other content, causing people to miss posts on other subs."
Fluttershy,3atsti,Myrandall,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:27:16 2015 UTC,If you insist.
Fluttershy,3aqx5v,nano23823,2,Mon Jun 22 20:00:55 2015 UTC,I really like this one.
Fluttershy,3aqx5v,Myrandall,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:45:55 2015 UTC,Yeah!     I should probably cross-post it.
Fluttershy,3an74i,Myrandall,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:42:35 2015 UTC,How horrifying. Where can I get one?
Fluttershy,3a4trr,FactoryofRainbows,2,Wed Jun 17 06:04:15 2015 UTC,Is there a way to view the sources of some of these works?  There are several exceptionally nice ones that I do not recognize and I would love to find the artists more easily than via reverse image search.

Fluttershy,385rhi,MissGoldenDragon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:24:40 2015 UTC,Omg its so cute!
Fluttershy,37xjrq,Protosega,2,Sun May 31 05:58:04 2015 UTC,I love this style and I absolutely adore Flutterbat!

Fluttershy,37lffl,MissGoldenDragon,2,Thu May 28 14:04:03 2015 UTC,That title is redundant.
Fluttershy,37lfr2,MissGoldenDragon,2,Thu May 28 14:06:43 2015 UTC,It should be pointed out that this was made with a dress-up game. And they cropped out the watermark.  http://www.rinmarugames.com/game/?game_id=421
