kitchener,3e3zvx,RageLife,3,Tue Jul 21 19:55:07 2015 UTC,I have terrible teeth (sensitive enamel that no sealants or fluoride treatments could conquer) and I highly recommend Dentistry at University Downs in Waterloo (Bridge and University) - I've been going to them for 7 years now and have been cavity free for the first time in my life -- for someone who has had multiple root canals this is saying something
kitchener,3e3zvx,bingbingy,2,Tue Jul 21 23:06:00 2015 UTC,"I recommend Dr. Ramirez. He is located at the corner of Fairway and Wilson, right across from Fairview Park mall. My fiance has been seeing him all her life and has said nothing but good things."
kitchener,3e3zvx,veetoe157,2,Tue Jul 21 23:13:39 2015 UTC,"Toothworks is a chain and can be on the pricey side. We went there in Toronto and did not like it. Can't speak for the local locations but we never saw the same dentist twice and never felt like we were getting quality dental care.  This was confirmed when we moved here and saw Dr Sumner at Lawrence Dental. He is amazing. Definitely cares, close attention to detail. Does an initial appointment where he goes over your history in detail, does new xrays (if you need them) and comes up with a treatment plan.  The caveat is that he isn't really cheap. But no really good dentist will be. If you're honestly looking for a great dentist who will do his honest best at getting you in good health, I highly recommend him."
kitchener,3e3zvx,BexterV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:32:59 2015 UTC,"I second Dr. Sumner. I never had a dentist I liked and I found him by going on some ratemds website and he was rated #1 in Kitchener and after meeting him I could see why. I didn't find him pricier than the average dentist but I don't have much experience with dentistry saying that. Before insurance, it cost me $228 for a new patient exam which included a few xrays and then it cost $517 to have 3 cavities removed and scaling on half of my teeth (he did the right side while I was under anesthesia from the fillings). I'm actually not uncomfortable going back to the dentist for once and am going to make it a regular thing like when I was a kid (!).  Edit: those prices include taxes and are exact - I got them off my credit card bill. His staff submits your insurance claim for you and if you have awesome insurance you get your money direct deposited within a few business days :)"

Despite it not being in your area of choice, if you have the opportunity to visit Dr. Tsandelis in the Pioneer area do not take anyone up on it. His office is... Less than stellar.

kitchener,3e2hct,mashmo,12,Tue Jul 21 13:21:52 2015 UTC,"A few remarks:   like the article says, if you have a road defect you want repaired, call it in. Make sure you describe exactly where the problem is, and what it is - for instance, potholes around sewer grate in front of 123 main street.   All three cities run pothole repair crews year-round and it'll go into the repair queue the article incorrectly assumes the standards for acceptable road quality is the same between cities in Ontario - they're not.  there's a couple good things about cycling on city roads in Waterloo Region - I'd say drivers are more aware of cyclists than in some of the other similar sized cities, and also, most times when roads are reconstructed, cycling facilities are added or improved, particularly for Regional roads."
kitchener,3e2hct,Branston_Pickle,4,Tue Jul 21 13:57:01 2015 UTC,"Great points. I hadn't considered that standards vary by city.

kitchener,3dr8zt,fon10alis,17,Sat Jul 18 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"But the event is in Victoria Park, I don't think anything is planned downtown.  Also many closer parking spots than the one you're at so not much foot traffic."
kitchener,3dr8zt,luckierbridgeandrail,2,Sat Jul 18 18:56:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, walking from Ontario is probably better then the mess that is down near Joseph and Queen. This way you would avoid the havoc that would take 15 minutes anyways and pop right onto Weber to just about anywhere in the city.   But if you look at the Ribfest FAQ, specifically parking - no one has adjusted anything to direct people to these lots (the one at city hall is great if your coming or going from Victoria-East, as the one on Duke would be better accessed from neighborhoods South of Victoria and People from Waterloo on the Expressway).    We could then direct people on streets that are clean, have retailers and services. Making sure that we showed off downtown. Instead, we have frustrated people everywhere, driving like maniacs, ending up in areas that they see the worse of downtown, not the best of it."
kitchener,3dr8zt,lingenfelter22,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:45:44 2015 UTC,"Directly between Victoria Park and King St is the bus terminal, which is how people get home from Ribfest. Unless they're just there to eat ribs, which makes no sense at all."

I'm taking the picture down my street, and maybe should have moved closer, but it's not about Ontario being empty (though more people up here would be nice). It's about King street being a ghost town.  And, yeah, the event is in Vic Park, but really, there should at least be SOME bleed over.  Maybe it's just my mood today, or whatever, but I can't help but feel that the construction of late is keeping people from the downtown core, and the emptiness of King during what should be a huge draw just sort of hit that home for me.  Again though, it's a blah day here, so my opinion of it may just be me reading more into it than there is..."

The people who frequent Ribfest also aren't going to be interested in thrift shops ""home small batch brewed coffees"", hipster movies, or comic books.  Ribest has its very own clientele, most of which is country or suburban.  Kultrun was a better example of a festival that appealed to more of what the ""new downtown"" vibe is.

I do recognize that Kitchener is a bit run down, and a bit hobotastic sometimes (which I partially blame Waterloo FOR, but that's another thing entirely), but really, Waterloo feels like a giant student housing complex to me most of the time, and I'd rather be downtown Kitchener than Uptown Waterloo on most weekend nights.  and every time folks mash Kitchener in WITH Waterloo, for some reason Kitchener just looks like less.

It doesn't help that legislation to go after property owners like this seems pretty toothless. There's a building near my neighbourhood in uptown like this; constantly dirty, everything in disrepair, building is an eyesore, tenants sitting on the stoop drinking all day, but despite complaints and police there constantly the city just kind of throws their arms up and says ""what can we do?""."

Ended up taking a place in the same area (Duke/Queen), only slightly better (crappy, broken windows that couldn't be replaced/repaired because it was a 'heritage' building, almost no hot water, ants like you wouldn't believe, drug deals in the lobby) but hey...

If that's you, it's your own damn problem. The suburbs are a real place where people of all kinds live, and having hens or hanging up clothes to dry improves peoples' lives while having no real harm to the community."

kitchener,3d735w,fon10alis,-1,Tue Jul 14 03:46:37 2015 UTC,"So, here's the thing: having chickens, or any kind of poultry, in close quarters to people in cities is a really bad public health problem.  Remember bird flu? People got freaked out about that. Now imagine if your neighbor had 8 chickens less than 25 feet from where you sleep. You'd be freaked out right?  It's just one of those things that urban centers can't enjoy like the country folk can. Might not be a big deal, but it's certainly not worth the risk of a mega-flu pandemic wreaking havoc."
kitchener,3d735w,mennojargon,14,Tue Jul 14 01:54:43 2015 UTC,"But heres the thing: Most Avian Flu's start out in the wild population and jump to domesticated chicken via factory farms. Where conditions are crowded, very unsanitary and the birds are not healthy populations. Most people would have closer contact with Chickadees, Robins and owls then backyard chickens. This doesnt mean that backyard chickens should be completely unregulated as these same conditions can happen in home coops. However, a healthy home population is not a health threat."

kitchener,3cv92v,Sachsmachine,2,Sat Jul 11 02:09:12 2015 UTC,"You are best off trying to manage until Monday. You may be able to go to a family doctor/on call doctor or walk in clinic and they will likely prescribe you some pain medication to get you through till Monday.   Try taking some extra strength advil or if you don't have that, Tylenol and see if that helps at all.   I mean if the pain is unbearable seek medical advice. Maybe there is even some emergency dental place?"

kitchener,3ct7yv,fon10alis,5,Fri Jul 10 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"Central Fresh Market had this same problem - they kept putting signs up and someone kept taking them down. I probably wouldn't have found the ""back way"" to their parking lot if not for the signs they put up. You might want to give their store manager a call and see what he suggests.  I work downtown for a large company and I know we have had a lot of problems with signage. Our Facilities staff have had several conversations with the GrandLinq crew and it's only marginally improved.  A couple of suggestions off the top of my head:   1) Contact the local Councillor - I think it's Frank Etherington downtown?  2) If you can get emails from the Region, the City, and GrandLinq all claiming it's not their issue, the BIA will pretty much have to step up. Since they represent all businesses, they have a lot more clout than you do.  3) Keep badgering The Record until they do a story on this. Reach out to your neighbouring business and see if they can corroborate.  Good luck!"
kitchener,3ct7yv,MrVictorianPainting,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks, we have been in contact with Central Fresh. Seems they are out on their own, not very much sympathy from RoW, or CoK. They have a person who's job is to replace missing signs daily.  I have called Frank Etherington, he seems to think the BIA will deal with it adequately. In the process of contacting him again.  GrandLinq has a PR Person who we are to deal with. However, the person seems to have little understanding of how impacted the businesses have been and how little Grandlinq has done to lessen the impact. We were promised great communication and sensitivity, which is not what we are experiencing.  We have a CBC interview on Monday, I am sure that it will result in more."
kitchener,3ct7yv,caleeky,2,Sat Jul 11 04:57:20 2015 UTC,"With respect to Central, you'll see their signs on private property (I and 3 other neighbours all have them - just to be cheeky). The community does want to support local business through this construction. Perhaps you could work with your business neighbours, and perhaps upstairs tenants to host the relevant signs? Harder downtown where there aren't front lawns, of course, but you get the idea. :)"

kitchener,3ct7yv,noxel,6,Tue Jul 14 05:51:08 2015 UTC,"Just put them up. If you make it high enough that it is not easy to take down, then you'll be golden.   If there is one thing that we have learned in all of this, it is that if you make something even slightly annoying for some of these guys, then they'll just ignore it.  If they're response is ""Why put signs up?"" , then I can only think that their response would also be ""Why take the signs down?"""
kitchener,3ct7yv,Ostabby,4,Fri Jul 10 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've dealt with signage bylaws here before and it's a brutal experience. RoW and CoK (as well as CoW) are misaligned and make up rules as they go. Half the time if you ask them to explain their reasonings or point out the relevant bylaw they won't be able to, either out of pure laziness or because ""that's just how it is"".   I would just ignore them and do what you need to do to benefit your business, as long as your not inconveniencing others it shouldn't be an issue. If it becomes an issue make a big stink about it on social media and contact local news companies."
kitchener,3ct7yv,Masamundane,4,Sat Jul 11 00:07:01 2015 UTC,"I had a shop and had a sign at the road for 5-6 years, I had a visit from a bylaw officer and was told to take it down. I asked why they claimed that someone complained about it. I asked who they said they can't give that information. I asked what bylaw I was violating they couldn't give me one. But I had to take it down anyways or be fined $300.  I took it down and left it down for 3 months, my business dropped so I put it back up it stayed up for 2 more years before I sold the shop. Not a single visit again from the bylaw officers."
kitchener,3ct7yv,Ostabby,2,Sat Jul 11 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"We got the same warning for the same reason. SOMEONE complained, which is to say, some other business.   We'd really only left the sign up when we moved to begin with because it was the middle of January. Either way, it was 'take it down, or be fined $300...  ...Point being, maybe put up the signs anyways, and wait for the bylaw to get to you. Seems that if your neighbors don't bitch, nothing will happen."
kitchener,3ct7yv,Quock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:00:13 2015 UTC,That's a great idea. Make it a game of cat and mouse with the signs. Maybe get them high enough that the people in the highrises could see them.

There's a reason all the good businesses are off the main strip))  So, downtown is ghost town, and even in this subbreddit, there's constant reminder of what Waterloo offers. Folks don't want to come downtown Kitchener. Why would the ION change that?   Why deal with the 'Kitchener Charm' of random bums, when you can just hop on the coming monorail, and ride it to Fairway, or to Waterloo? You can ride from mall to mall with no hassle.

Yah so fuck gentrification."

I'm very much looking forward to having light rail transit, but I'm not at all satisfied with the current impact to businesses or how confusing it is to find a new route when construction barriers keep changing, sidewalks are sometimes open and sometimes not (and often not marked), and no detours are marked for pedestrians or vehicles."

Another server came out, looked at our table, said ""umm, there are a lot of you here, so it'd probably be best if you just went up to the bar for your drinks"" and walked away. That exact wording, not with a kind apologetic tone, but with total indifference like she just couldn't be bothered to serve us. No service for the rest of the evening.  So yeah, the service is shit (at least in my experience). The drinks were good and the location is novel but it's not worth it IMO."

Instead of focusing on the REAL event to make it a yearly success (the paid concert that actually brings people to spend money) he got sidetracked.  BMF has failed in something like 4 or 5 other cities, and it's always been the same guy organizing it... I think we know exactly where the problem lies.

An anchor point in the 2-3 days of music at the park should be established, then going off and expanding into the more community interaction stuff later.  The lineups were great last year and the event overall was good but there were significant things to resolve for another year to keep the crowds, this is on the promoter as he's the head honcho who dictates how everything happens.  I worry about the longevity and success because they've skipped around a lot already and it would be a shame for us to invest in something that's just here for this guy to make a few bucks wherever he can do it...I wonder how many people are coming from out of town this year, will they bother to hang around on Sunday now or just take off (loss of potential customers to local businesses)  They also never bothered to answer people's questions on what they would do do resolve last years more concerning issues (VIP was terrible, water was banned from sale by vendors because an exclusivity deal being the biggest ones) then they jacked the ticket prices around 30%.  Sorry but that's just no way to run a continually successful show especially when it's not your first attempt, it's like your 10th."

kitchener,3cpy3g,bingbingy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:14:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they gave some silly ""sport water"" company exclusivity over sales so food vendors could sell pop, iced tea, etc.  This year I think they actually planned water refill stations which is really what any festival should provide.  some people will still buy water from vendors."

He has also interacted with another neighborhood cat who drops by our back yard from time to time. He watches him until he leaves, but seems relaxed.

kitchener,3cdbwp,Fogest,10,Wed Jul 8 18:49:01 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people of these groups do not feel safe in a normal shop? Being in these kinds of groups it seems like you should try to fit in and mix with everyone else rather than isolating yourself from everyone else. Everyone should embrace who they are and not have to attend special sessions just to feel normal.
kitchener,3cdbwp,sickofallofyou,6,Tue Jul 7 02:50:48 2015 UTC,Sometimes people just like to be in a space with folks just like them. It's relaxing.
kitchener,3cdbwp,charrzard,9,Tue Jul 7 12:44:32 2015 UTC,"workshops for things like fixing bikes and putting them together are more often than not male dominated, and women, trans and other non binary folks can sometimes feel out of place and awkward and yes, even unsafe.  The answer to these groups of people feeling unsafe or awkward in situations outside of a safe space isn't to tell them to ""try to fit in"" and ""embrace who you are"" it's to identify why these people feel unsafe and fix it  until then, as a girl, I'm excited to see this workshop happening and provided I can, I'll be attending."
kitchener,3cdbwp,GoldenTyga117,-2,Tue Jul 7 05:47:07 2015 UTC,Such fucking garbage. This was done in the states and had a major backlash because what you're doing is discriminating against an ENTIRE gender. It should not be allowed and I'm pretty sure it's probably illegal. This isn't something to be proud of. If you honestly feel unsafe at a BIKE shop maybe you need psychological help and not your own special snowflake night.
kitchener,3cdbwp,bingbingy,3,Tue Jul 7 12:30:37 2015 UTC,was done in the states and had a major backlash because what you're doing is discriminating against an EN   We encourage people of these genders to come. we don't turn people away.

kitchener,3cdbwp,chibot,0,Tue Jul 7 13:40:44 2015 UTC,Using AA is a terrible example since they don't prevent anyone from attending. So cool can I start a business and completely exclude women ? Maybe I'll do that and when there's a Shit storm I'll refer back to your comment.  No it's not going off the deepend. Discrimination against men isn't okay just like it isn't okay to discriminate against anyone else. The fact that you think it's okay to discriminate against men makes you an asshole. Once again this was done in the states and received major backlash.  Seriously if you're so fucking sensitive that you can't be around men then get some mental help.
kitchener,3cdbwp,Fogest,3,Tue Jul 7 13:58:57 2015 UTC,"WE DONT EXCLUDE no where do we say we do!! WE ENCOURAGE ALCHOHOLICS TO COME TO THE MEETING BECUASE ITS FOR ALCHOHOLICS.   It's like LGBT nights at a bunch of other places. people with similar lives want to get together to meet others.  Again we are not dis-allowing. if you really wanna come to a night with a bunch of women and trans/non-binary folk... Would you not feel uncomfortable and like you don't fit in?   And as for mental help, yup. if you are reciving mental health you are unallowed to visit any place ever except for mental help facilities. <sarcasm there are many small steps with rehabilitating after a psychotic break down. If you are triggered by men or black people or kids, you have to get used to it. But it's nice to have a space where you can build confidence with less worry.  It's been a 6 year process with me and I finally have a paying job, a significant other, friends, and am able to think clearly out in public around men, people of color, kids, and anyone else. It has nothing to do with these individual people, it make/made me start thinking scary irrational thoughts (when you think everyone can hear what you're thinking, having a negative thought about a person is a grueling anxiety attack)  People who understand and aren't going to judge me based on being scared are the type of people i need to be around for my health. Knowing that i'll find these people anywhere I go? Not very concrete.   I hope you actually read this and may think outside the box.

kitchener,3cdbwp,Fogest,0,Tue Jul 7 17:03:31 2015 UTC,Ya i usually don't either but at the same time I feel the need to show other people we fight for what's right. and who knows maybe some other people will learn something :)  Yes! we do sell bikes. As it's a volunteer based shop how often we get bikes out varies and we sell out very fast. really high demand. (we get a ton finished during winter so it's suggest to come at the very end of winter start of spring for a wide selection.)  And when we get busy we are helping people with their own bikes which means it takes longer to get bikes out. average price is 30-60 dollars cash only no tax. kids bikes are almost always free.    We suggest calling and asking what we have (if anything) and we can (usually) put it in the back until the end of the day to make sure you get a look at it.  519 804 2466 ext. 1
kitchener,3cdbwp,chibot,3,Tue Jul 7 17:10:09 2015 UTC,"Well it's not specifically 'feeling safe', it's about having support out there. Especially for people who identify as Trans, you see a lot of 'LGBT' groups coming up which makes sense right? People want to find people to identify with. So making things like this 'stand out' it may encourage people to learn about things maybe they weren't sure they really wanted to learn about.  A lot of people have anxiety, man, women or any other gender. And to create spaces with a social construct allows and encourages more social spaces which again leads to meeting new people, finding friends who have similarities to you.   hope that makes sense.  *side note, there is sexism in the bike shop. Not a shit load, but as a female i encounter it. The most common is being shocked when I'm the one in charge and know what i'm doing. On the odd occasion more serious things occur.  From a customer stand point in those situations as a female, a male may feel entitled to 'do the work for you' and assume you need help. Sometimes even to the point of taking tools out of their hands, or fixing something with out even asking. Women don't like it, but if it's in a space where they don't feel like they would be backed up if they wanted to confront the situation, we are more likely to shut up and deal with it."
kitchener,3cdbwp,bingbingy,-4,Tue Jul 7 15:45:22 2015 UTC,"If you want to be treated the same act like it. You can complain about males treating you different yet instead of fixing the problem are just ignoring the issue and trying to create a safe place. If males are doing this at a bike shop, then don't let them. I don't see how it is so hard? How is it any different than someone trying to help out a newbie? They don't know your skill level, prove it to them. If you prove your skill then males won't doubt you. I feel like the issue here is that you, and others are making it look like you don't have skill.  Act like a normal person in a bike shop and don't try and seek attention. No one cares who you are, they care about your skills and will naturally try to help those struggling."

It was canceled again as he was double booked or some stupid excuse.... Now I'm annoyed as I have waited about a year and a half... So we set another date, this time before the date happens I get a call asking if I wouldn't mind going with another one of the artist as Jamie is really booked and about to take time off. I say no, I paid for a bit of this, I have seen the art work as it has been drawn and I want it done by him.. We cannot come to agreement I wish for my art I've paid for. They say no, I want my money back, they say no as his work has been done.. So I am out a tattoo, I'm out my money and down payment and Tora can kick rocks.

kitchener,3bxm50,caleeky,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:24:02 2015 UTC,"Good ol' Frankie's. That's where I celebrated my 19th birthday many years ago. I love Kitchener's dives. Caper's used to be another favourite of mine but I would never go there without a group of male friends unless I wanted to get felt up by old men. Hell, even with a group i had an old man touch my hair and tell me to never cut it because ""long hair is feminine"". Okay grandpa, maybe back in the forties.  I was actually drugged at the Break Room so that is the one bar downtown I refuse to ever go to again.  Edit: which crack den across from the Museum are you referring to? Isn't the Walper across from the Museum (aka used to be Rum Runner, now is TWH Social)?"

kitchener,3bxpby,tbonecoco,4,Fri Jul 3 00:40:41 2015 UTC,"I don't own my own company, nor am I looking for side work but I just wanted to give you a heads up about GFCIs. I'm assuming by ""converting to GFCI outlets"" you have older ungrounded wiring? If that's the case, you don't need to convert every receptacle in your home to a GFCI, to have GFCI protection. You could just put a GFCI at the start of each receptacle circuit and anything down line from it (assuming it is hooked up correctly) would be GFCI protected. This will save you upwards of a couple hundred dollars (depending on the amount of outlets in your home) plus labour. If you're not talking about ungrounded wiring, ignore everything I just said. :)"

kitchener,3bxpby,joshoohaah,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"Once you decided to pick a company, check it out on better business bureau. It would at least give you an more accurate of what type of company you are dealing with. The last thing you want is to get screwed over or ripped off right after you just bought your new home.   And i want to point out, make sure the electrician/company you hire, has a 309A ticket. Thats construction and maintenance. People with 442A (industiral electrician) can't legally do that job. Another thing you want to make sure is they have a master's electrician in their company. Because if they don't have master's electrician, they cannot legally do contracting job, because one of the requirement for the company to get a contracting license for electrical work, is to have a master electrican in the crew.  Another thing to note is, if they are going to do rewiring/installation, after the work is done, they have the obligation to call ESA. Any good/real electrician would call them after a new install. This is because if they don't call, and your house burns down or some shit happens, the electrician that did the job will have to appear in court. But, if they have the ESA signed off on the job, they are immune from all legal responsibilty. ESA are professional guys, once they sign off, you know the job was well done and fits all the electrical code for ontario."

In the evenings they convert it to lane swims, I find that most times I went there was only a few other people there so I never had to share lanes.  There is also a city pool located on Fisher Hallman that is pretty nice as well, not too far from the Superstore. It's usually the same deal there, not too many people and a lane to yourself. Both of these pools also have saunas as well!"

There is also the waterloo rec centre near waterloo park,  but i find it really busy and the water has quite a bit of chlorine in it. Breithaupt is my favorite although it lacks a sauna which is nice for warming up first. If you are low income or on social assistance,  there is a discounted membership pass. just ask one of the people working at the cash register for the application pamphlet.

I have been so happy with all of them.  Unfortunately I don't really have pictures of me with any colours in. This is Deep Purple, after about two weeks, and also I mixed with conditioner for a lighter tone. I think that's the only shot I have. Be prepared, if you use their Atomic Pink or any of the pink based colours (Deep Purple is one of these), they are VERY tenacious. I have been doing red for about six months, and have only a few inches of leftovers from this purple at the ends, and still after a couple washes, the pink shows through the red. It doesn't bother me, but if you're looking to change often, you will have a hard time getting rid of this pink! On the other hand, if you want a colour that lasts....Atomic Pink. It won't go anywhere. Seriously."

I'll bet if you called The Record and said you were a downtown business who is having an issue with the LRT construction, Jeff Outhit would be at your door before you had a chance to hang up the phone.  There would be a big article in the Record the next day, with someone from the Region saying those signs are merely temporary, and just by coincidence someone will show up the very next day with professional signage that they were planning on installing anyway."

kitchener,3b2xrx,codyrat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:33:04 2015 UTC,"Similar situation for a friend who owned a small business on a road unde construction in Alberta. The construction workers made a sign in similar quality to the one posted above. He quickly printed off a design with all the business' logos that were on the street. When they were working he just asked for the guy in charge, showed him the sign and they said sure.   The city will always say no because they have to follow whatever rules they decide. But the guy operating the crane dosn care what the sign looks like."
kitchener,3b2xrx,resilientenigma,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:12:43 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea, however, the Region and Grandlinq have removed other signs. We'd love to get people using Hall's Lane more, it's great for walking, cycling and street art. I have talked to the Region about signs to direct the traffic through Hall's Lane and been told not to as they will be removed.   Part of the policy is to not to advertise specific businesses. From previous news stories, it seems the region and city prohibit 'temporary signs' from any roads to cut down on over use. Makes sense, when you see 10 of these signs on a corner can be a huge eyesore. Maybe a regional Councillor will see this and propose something to exempt the bylaw for temporary construction redirection."

I guess when looking for an apartment looking at mirrors, signalling, or just generally operating your car safely is not that important.  The Dashcam was $100 at Canada Computers.

kitchener,3ar6ob,thefringthing,2,Tue Jun 23 02:31:48 2015 UTC,Yeah. Pepi's thing is they have pretty top-notch toppings and they pile on a fuck tonne of them.
kitchener,3ar6ob,lingenfelter22,5,Tue Jun 23 03:02:40 2015 UTC,Franklin Pizza's Panzerottis are excellent both baked and fried.  Pepi's is great if you're a freak about having a ridiculous amount of toppings.  It's tasty but gets greasy quick if you order too many meat items.  I like Delicious Pizza Bakery at Fairway and Lackner as well. And they have good homemade desserts.
kitchener,3ar6ob,DestinysParent,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:22:40 2015 UTC,I like Franklin too.  Their wings aren't bad either if you're doing a pizza and wings.

It's not a go-to when I need to feed a bunch of middle schoolers.  Does anybody know a place that makes good cheap stuff in that area? I'm talking Forest Hill/Forest Heights.  Side note - I'm originally from Halifax, and even after years here I can't get used to Kitchener's mediocre pizza.    Are there any places that make it with any ethnic flair?  The Greek & Lebanese communities totally own the pizza in Halifax, and I miss it so much.  edit - spelling."

I wouldn't call it the best in the region, but it meets your criteria of cheap, good, and close.  I believe that they're family run. EDIT: http://www.magicpizza.ca  Pizzaville has decent pizza but price is average.   Pepi's has great pizza but its a bit non-standard...crust is more like pastry, and their sauce is sweet.  They are not cheap either but put on lots of toppings.  Ace Pizza & Shawarma on King near Queen in Kitchener /had/ amazing 'shawarma pizza' (that's right, pizza crust and sauce with shawarma meat and sauces.  It was amazing and cheap, but they recently had their pizza oven shut down because it wasn't vented properly. :(  I hope they get it fixed soon cuz that was quickly becoming my goto pizza!"
kitchener,3ar6ob,echothree33,3,Mon Jun 22 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"Pizza Roma on Activa is reasonably priced.  Quality is above generic chains, below Pizza Prosciutto.  Service is touch and go (specially wrt the delivery drivers), so takeout is recommended.    Rustic Slice is good, but not cheap.    Pepi's is great - not cheap per pizza, but each slice is much more filling than generic pizzas, so it evens out that way."
kitchener,3ar6ob,KJAWolf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:08:04 2015 UTC,I second Pizza Roma.  They pile on the toppings.  I always recommend pickup over delivery for the hottest freshest pizza (from any pizza place).

kitchener,3ar6ob,HeyCarpy,2,Tue Jun 23 00:51:26 2015 UTC,This isn't local - but maybe would help fill your need for some Halifax authenticity - it's worth the 45 - 60 minute drive. http://www.halifaxdonairandpizza.com/ The donairs are excellent.
kitchener,3ar6ob,HeyCarpy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:04:20 2015 UTC,I've been there!  It's pretty close to authentic. What's missing is the volume of customers that demands everything be fresh.

kitchener,3ae353,mpd618,5,Fri Jun 19 12:52:05 2015 UTC,"That's on an interior wall, and those rooms/offices had been rented recently. Probably just a poster that people had up for some reason.  The graffiti is likely from when homeless people used to squat in the mayfair."

kitchener,3aebz6,cupoftequila,7,Fri Jun 19 12:50:54 2015 UTC,I can recommend that you don't use Cooper Law. When we bought our house we were dicked around a lot. We had a lot of issues with them.
kitchener,3aebz6,FesteringZombie,2,Fri Jun 19 13:31:31 2015 UTC,I've used them twice without any problems.
kitchener,3aebz6,rpmcgovern,5,Fri Jun 19 16:10:57 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, the majority of the incompetence came from their paralegal that worked in the office. She got into a verbal argument with us regarding the amount of money we owed them, how much we owed the realtor (we put down 20%, and she argued that we didn't and got the numbers wrong)    It put a really sour taste in my mouth."
kitchener,3aebz6,FesteringZombie,2,Fri Jun 19 17:11:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any problems with Richard, except he didn't do the paperwork, his associate did and they charged me $1,500 for a standard and simple transaction when buying last fall.  My realtor is no longer recommending him based on price alone, it's too expensive.  My parents have used Richard for their wills and estate planing and had a great experience.  So his problem is the fees, when others can do the same job for $300 less, possibly a little more."
kitchener,3aebz6,ILikeStyx,5,Sat Jun 20 16:32:56 2015 UTC,I used Don Travers. Was very good. Found mistakes made by the other party. http://www.paquettetravers.com/

People go to him because he has set fees and is one of the cheapest in town BUT he charges EXTRA for a bunch of additional searches that SHOULD be done and are included in most other firms' fees!   I personally would recommend Warren Griffin, Steve Funk, or Ted Giesbrecht from GGFI Law. If you want a lawyer in Waterloo try Haney Haney & Kendall."

It is clean and quiet and the people are friendly but everyone keeps mainly to themselves on my street making it seem standoffish. Mostly full of upper middle class families. I have smelled the dump once in 15 years and it was very faint. The dump, traffic and noise are not even remotely an issue. In most parts of the neighbourhood you pretty much need a car to survive as most things are just too far to walk to comfortably. No one gets home mail delivery here as far as I can tell. This neighbourhood has a very poor walkability rating."
kitchener,3aebz6,ILikeStyx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:42:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! We were thinking it would probably be a lot of the things you mentioned--people keeping to themselves, upper-middle class, need a car, etc. We will miss the friendlier vibe in Downtown Kitchener for sure but hopefully Westvale makes up for it in other ways!"
kitchener,3aebz6,ILikeStyx,0,Thu Jul 2 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"You didn't inform yourself about your neighbourhood before moving?  You might miss where you're coming from but Westvale isn't terrible.  I actually have multiple friends who have moved there within the past 2-3 years and a few friends who grew up there and parents still live there.  It does every now and again get a nasty whiff of the dump, especially the closer to Ira Needles and University you are, but that is what it is.  I'm not sure how 'bad' the traffic/noise from the two schools is, obviously in the summer it's nice and quiet and it all depends on of you're living near them."

On Friday, I was walking to an appointment on King, close to City Hall, and decided to cut through the park.  Along the way, I seemed to pick up an unusual straggler, who followed me almost to my destination.    A really tall, maybe 6'-4"", black fellow, with African accented English, was pretty much lock-step with me from the clock tower, through the Manulife parking lot/complex/Charles St. construction, until I reached King.  He seemed harmless enough but the guy was right beside me for the entire stretch.  He didn't talk, except to tell others that called out to him that he had an appointment.  Just before getting to King, he bolted across Water St. and double timed it back towards the park.  When we were alone in the Manulife parking lot, I though shit was going to have to go down.  Nothing happened, ultimately, but it was one freaky situation."

If the cyclist is taking the lane, that means temporarily merging into the next lane to the left, just as you would pass a car.  I agree with your sentiment about irresponsible cyclists, with the exception that I think the practice of blowing through stop signs and traffic lights when there's even the possibility of any other traffic being present ought to be stamped out. But stuff like switching into the crosswalk without dismounting to get through a busy intersection and then back onto the road is fine, even if technically you aren't allowed to do it.

kitchener,39mkg9,Masamundane,14,Sat Jun 13 00:41:36 2015 UTC,"this here.   Folks, if we don't report these types of people EVERY GODDAMN TIME, the will just keep at it.   As the weather gets warmer, you'll see a lot more ""twinkies"" (folks pretending to be homeless because it's cool or whatever) on the streets in any town. Kitchener has an already unfortunate hobo to regular person ratio, which looks worse when these folks join the fray.  Should mention that the ones that threaten or cajole are part of the twinkie crowd, as they don't know the actual feel of desperate want that actual homeless feel. They're out for the kicks, and don't care really at all.  Add to that that Uptown (and other cities) ship us their homeless because of Kitchener's superior help. UNFORTUNATELY, these folks aren't often guided TO said help, and are instead dumped off a bus.  ANYways, while King was closed, we saw no one on the streets BUT the shifties, which made everything look worse.  SORRY, sorry, tangent. Call the cops every time folks. If no one says anything, these jerks will stay around making life miserable for everyone."

kitchener,39mkg9,modernparts,14,Sun Jun 14 12:18:20 2015 UTC,"I've done some thinking about this and its slightly related. If we picked a central point for where downtown is I'd say it's shifting. There was a time when downtown was really Frederick and king.  I think right now the central  point is near matter of taste. Soon it will shift close to Google and the new station. The reason I bring this up is that the Duke food block in my opinion isn't in a sustainable location long term. The revitalization is happening closer to city hall and the area south of there is trailing behind. You can see that in the places that still struggle to stay alive and the ones that are doing well.   Next, there's too any restaurants and coffee shops downtown. There's just isn't enough people coming downtown to justify them all. People see the success of places like holy guacamole though and assume any idea will work. Obviously this isn't true so you get a higher rate of failures.   Downtown also has an issue with niche stores which only cater to a small audience. These stores will always struggle because there's not enough new customers coming to the area to justify their existence.   Lastly there's the age old problem of the shelters and clinics that historically have been found more in downtown than uptown. They unfortunately attract people who are mentally unstable and will do shifty things like threaten rape and harass people. There no solution here that I can think of but it gets back to my original point. As the central point moves north those clinics and shelters won't be as visible and conveniently located.   Oh and one more thing: the city has said they don't expect the revitalization to be an immediate thing. It will take at minimum a few years to start seeing the effects.  Also it's a lot better already than it used to be. I remember going to Cameron and doing a social studies class on urban decay. It was really bad for a while so there was lots to discuss."
kitchener,39mkg9,caleeky,13,Sun Jun 14 14:42:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'd also say you need to expect businesses to fail. This article http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-marketing/five-pieces-of-advice-for-aspiring-restaurateurs/article592990/ says that 60% fail within 30 years. It's not a sign of decline.   In fact, the closures can be associated with renewal, as increasing rents put pressure on unprofitable businesses. As the economy of the area grows, you'll see waves of premature hype and failed investment, with some businesses surviving through it.  I'd say the average is towards improvement.   Not that OP is necessarily young, but consider that 20 year olds coming for University see the area over a year or so. I've been here 10 years (30s now), and have seen a big improvement. All it takes is a couple of unstable people hanging around persistently to change a vibe for someone with such a small sample.  Both centres are walking distance from home and I find myself headed to Kitchener more often. It has more to offer in terms of inexpensive ""ethnic"" eating, which is what I'm into. Yeah, some spots need to get tidied - Frankie's, the crack den apartments across from the Museum,  etc.  But overall I'm pleased with what I'm seeing.  That said, the people who are the ""undesirables"" need help. I'd be happy if my property taxes went to appropriate community housing (in the same area - no need to push people out), jobs programs, etc. Maybe a little more police presence (community policing, not ham fisted enforcement, please). Fix it, don't sweep it under the rug."
kitchener,39mkg9,modernparts,6,Fri Jun 12 21:06:23 2015 UTC,To add to that I think business owners go with what's safe and what's safe is what's known. Kitchener has lots of restaurants because they've worked in the past. Clothing stores have tended to struggle so you don't see as many new ventures there.   If I was a business owner I think I'd be looking at uptown though and seeing what businesses work there that can't be found downtown. Just quickly thinking I'd say baby clothes and a grocery store closer to Victoria would be smart. A new book store might do well too depending on location
kitchener,39mkg9,kookydad,6,Fri Jun 12 21:19:57 2015 UTC,Believe me it way better now than 30 years ago. Although IMHO the city need to give up its obsession with charging for parking.
kitchener,39mkg9,Masamundane,11,Fri Jun 12 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"Revitalization has seen ups and downs of late, but what you're talking about is another problem that no one really wants to discuss.   Kitchener has a large amount of mental health, rehab, and homeless facilities, or at least we did. (many of the shelters will be closing due to safety issues and lack of staff). Due to this, Waterloo, Toronto, and other cities often ship us their homeless.   WHICH was part of the agreement, at least where Waterloo was concerned.   http://communityservices.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/communityprogramssupports/domiciliaryemergencyshelters.asp  You'll note it's called the Kitchener-Waterloo OOTC program. You'll also note that there are no actual shelters IN Waterloo. As this works, Kitchener gets all the money earmarked for shelters for both cities, and then gets ALL the homeless for both cities.  Waterloo Uptown looks all clean and whatnot because they ship all their undesirables to Kitchener. Kitchener, in return, tends to look like a bus shelter, so folks LEAVE our downtown and shop uptown.   THAT'S where the revitalization goes wrong, btw. Or at least is part of the problem. The problem isn't Kitchener's homeless, it's EVERYONE'S homeless, and mentally unstable in ONE GODDAMN CITY. Waterloo needs a shelter to thin out the homeless ratio.  The homeless and the addicts and the mentally unstable DO need assistance, and that assistance SHOULD be available. What it should NOT be is all set in one city.   ALSO? Folks need to stop leaving Kitchener to shop out in Waterloo. Seriously, the more dangerous types (like OP dealt with) feel a certain sense of safety in their actions because THEY'RE the only ones on the street.  Even here on this subreddit, I've seen several times where someone has asked about retail services, only to be told about a store in Uptown, instead of one here in Kitchener.   Sigh. Sorry, rant mostly over. the point is that for Kitchener to thrive, we need to stop being the dumping ground for other cities. That and people need to SHOP downtown, or yeah, stores go under."
kitchener,39mkg9,mpd618,7,Sat Jun 13 00:19:58 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the social services are all concentrated in downtown Kitchener, and there aren't yet enough people living downtown to balance out that population and counter the particularly bad ones by having more eyes on the street.  I think there has been quite a lot of downtown revitalization, but my sense is that the landlords have gotten too optimistic (in the form of rents) relative to the real demand and to how much it really is going to change with LRT. As have some businesses. We don't yet have a lot of people living downtown, nor do we have much likelihood of having a lot of people driving to downtown as a destination. There is a high peak lunchtime demand for restaurants, but it can be hard to exist on that especially if you thought it was going to be more."

In terms of revitalization, we've got two major condo projects under construction beside City Hall and at King & Victoria.  There are another 2 condo towers planned nearby on Victoria in addition to a massive Transit hub that will likely also host residential and commercial space.  Of course that Hub is coming with a transformational Light Rail Transit System (Ion) that traverses the city's core.  There's numerous other developments e.g. the new Courthouse, Google's beautiful/huge office building and a central Library that's been renovated/expanded to the point that's it's pretty-much new.  These are just off the top of my head.  I'm biased of course, but Kitchener's DT revitalization seems well in-hand."
kitchener,39mkg9,eandi,9,Sat Jun 13 02:08:25 2015 UTC,"This all happened today, but in terms of how often I work downtown it's usually a daily occurrence just not so much in one day.  I'd say at night is really bad, I used to do patient calls at night. It will no longer do them after being threatened several times, followed, barricaded in a stairwell...  I have a lot of friends who work at Google, live in Kaufman, or are part of the medical community and a lot of the women have experienced similar episodes. A lot of my friends (late 20s, early 30s) would 100% prefer to go take their money uptown because the social scene is better and they don't have to deal with these issues.

kitchener,39mkg9,charrzard,11,Sun Jun 14 14:13:07 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I agree. We need to deal with the homeless and panhandling population somehow. Programs, shelters, and arrests in some cases, whatever. The problem is that no one really does anything about it because ""that's how it always was here"" or because ""it used to be worse"" . I'm not from here originally so I don't have that mentality - newsflash, it fucking sucks here. It's sketch as anything all the time and I as a 5'10 man don't feel safe going out at nights by myself.   My building has had to remove dumpsters entirely at this point, because of harassment and all night dumpster divers as well as drugged up people just frolicking in there.

King St W was going to be a pedestrian-oriented retail utopia anchored by a pair of malls (for newcomers, the other one was the King Centre at 255 King W now occupied by Manulife). Market Square originally had an open public space at the corner (just like the new courthouse next door) with stairs to overlooking patios, which all got wrapped in glass when a later round of downtown revitalization briefly acknowledged winter — there was a proposal in the '80s for a mall-to-mall glass canopy.  More recently, the Canada Trust building revitalized downtown by bringing in office workers and a dead block for everyone else to walk past, the new City Hall revitalized downtown through pure civic pride, and the ongoing project of torching and/or flooding unwanted buildings revitalized downtown by bringing in more natural light."

Ask why social and metal Heath programs are cut.  Get to the root of the problem, the underlying social issues.  Why these people with problems are left on our streets to deal with.  Ask him what happened to the programs like house of friendship,  ROOF and HomeShare and why their budgets where cut, or driven into non-existence.

kitchener,39mkg9,lackoflogin,2,Sat Jun 13 13:52:14 2015 UTC,"I've mentioned it a bit, but the reason these budgets were cut is the WATERLOO is supposed to be paying for part of these projects, in return that KITCHENER takes ALL the homeless and mentally unstable so that Waterloo can be squeaky clean.  Thing is, Waterloo hasn't been paying its share anymore (from what I've been told), so Kitchener STILL has more homeless and whatnot than one city would normally produce, while having only half of its regular budget to deal with it.  Yes, talk to MPs about it. The best way to get an answer is to go to the top. That said though, maybe also ask why Waterloo has zero shelters in its borders. Ask what they are doing about the social issues beyond shipping them away.   EDIT: It should also be pointed out that much of the winter shelter in Kitchener has in the past been given by churches and similar groups. Many of these will be gone next year due to a lack of volunteers that have the qualifications, and a lack of proper protection for said volunteers from more unhinged users of these shelters. I'd strongly suggest though, that if folks are really concerned about these programs, they look into what they can do as a volunteer to help."

These cuts have been going on since the early 90s, and they've been deep.  Waterloo has a serious problem tho, just watch. Every time i go downtown waterloo I can't help but feel out of place."
kitchener,39mkg9,designut,0,Mon Jun 15 11:30:22 2015 UTC,They need to move the methadone clinics and shelters and soup kitchens to the outskirts of the city and let the scum thin out from the core.  That's the only way. Kitchener downtown sucks and has since the 80's.
kitchener,39mkg9,sonofamitch10,10,Mon Jun 15 13:49:59 2015 UTC,"As much as this is being downvoted, it is important to point out that Kitchener does host a number of social services to those who are mentally ill, challenged, suffer from addiction and/or those who are homeless. Waterloo doesn't. So, though, truthfully, the majority of people who require these services 'live' in Waterloo, they are often in Kitchener during the daytime - fortunate for uptown Waterloo, isn't it?  Though I certainly don't want people to feel unsafe in dt Kitchener, I also think that these services are the character of Kitchener, exemplified - it's a town which has heart, and I remind myself of that when I encounter some of the less-savory realities that come along with that."

kitchener,39cix2,matt_452,3,Sun Jun 21 16:56:40 2015 UTC,No one who is a fan of Rod Stewart wants to see him in a mud pit. That's basically what it comes down to.
kitchener,39cix2,matt_452,2,Thu Jun 11 12:55:45 2015 UTC,"wonder if another promoter will pick him up and put him indoors on the same night, where it will sell out."
kitchener,39cix2,ErnDizzy,2,Thu Jun 11 13:14:16 2015 UTC,that would be an interesting move.

kitchener,398dog,HeyCarpy,5,Wed Jun 10 05:37:00 2015 UTC,Its the same for getting out of downtown Kitchener. Slowly I am going crazy...
kitchener,398dog,BexterV,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:28:45 2015 UTC,"Or getting to the South end of Kitchener. With the Homer Watson exit shut down, Courtland, Fischer Hallman and Fairway are all congested. Then add to that the construction on Manitou from Bleams to Fairway/Courtland.   I just hope we don't experience the annual 401 shut down that we do almost every summer where all 401 traffic has to travel through the South end while all this going on."
kitchener,398dog,Kace10,3,Wed Jun 10 11:07:23 2015 UTC,"King st and Wellington St closures are driving traffic down Park too which is screwing up union. I live in Belmont Village and it's incredibly frustrating to get anywhere.   I moved to this town at the wrong time. But seriously why so many large scale, long term construction projects happening simultaneously? Its like there was no planning"
kitchener,398dog,BexterV,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:11:20 2015 UTC,"This is what's up in Cambridge as well. ION stops shutting down The Delta and Hespeler Road, and carving up the major intersections of Franklin Blvd to put in roundabouts all at the same time. Could this not be spaced out? There is now no way to get around this city."
kitchener,398dog,HeyCarpy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:55:03 2015 UTC,"NONE! And it's going to be going on for at least 18 months, which will inevitably get extended. I understand the desire to get all of it done at once, but it needed to be spaced out more. Waterloo isn't too bad north of Union for now but Kitchener is just a complete write off right now."
kitchener,396pi8,AccidentalRob,4,Tue Jun 9 17:26:54 2015 UTC,There is a similar service offered by a company called Game Asylum. They are a mobile LAN truck that comes to your house and holds a 2 hour birthday party playing a variety of games. Google game asylum and you will have all the info!
kitchener,396pi8,StefanGG,2,Tue Jun 9 18:32:39 2015 UTC,Of course! Game Asylum! I have seen them at various events in Kitchener... totally forgot about them. Thanks for the reminder.
kitchener,396pi8,mamoocando,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:49:58 2015 UTC,The Galaxy Waterloo does Xbox parties (xbox one or 360) and has Minecraft available to play. You schedule a 2 hour party and can do 4 players at onces. It's about $200 and you can get pizza and drinks during the xbox party or do some time in the party room before or after.  The only thing is the party has to be booked before the theatre opens or after the last show.
kitchener,396pi8,resilientenigma,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"4 players, for 200 bucks? might as well buy an xbox1, just saying."
kitchener,396pi8,mamoocando,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:24:13 2015 UTC,It's 4 players that can play at one time on the xbox. You can have as many people as you want in the theatre.
