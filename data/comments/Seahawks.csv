Luck, Wilson, Newton, Stafford are the only guys under 30 on that have guaranteed future success, who have shown they can carry the game on their back and win.  Do Russ and Cam get help from D, sure.   Do Luck and Stafford get help from those WRs, of course.   Its a team sport.  Securing any of those 4 for your franchise is going to be huge going forward.  Carr is unproven, but could be something if the Raiders don't fumble him like the Texans did his brother.  Bridgewater has a shot, but no way he out performs Russell. Kaep could progress.

Lazy journalists love to point out volume stats without so much as a single pause to consider things like what type of offense is being run or who did they put up such gaudy numbers against. IMO Luck is somehow riding his own coattails while putting up good enough (but not godlike) numbers.

Seahawks,3e3hw1,Soperypear,10,Tue Jul 21 19:52:54 2015 UTC,Yeah and Wilson has played in the toughest division in the NFL in the tougher conference his entire career while Luck has been in probably the easiest division in the easier conference in the NFL his whole career.

And on that note the Colts D is nowhere near as bad as their fans would lead you to believe. Were they world beaters last year? Hell nah, but they aren't jackasses either."

His hero is Manning so if you aren't a pocket passer who throws high percentage throws then you aren't any good.  Well, once Lynch is gone, hand the fucking ball to Wilson and watch him run circles around the D.  If you can't appreciate his leadership, his field sense, his athletic ability then go suck Mannings balls all you want.  I hope things work out for Wilson no matter where he ends up because I want a lot of people talking trash now to have to eat shit later.  Of course nobody remembers and as soon as they are stroking off Wilson they will say they said it all along and few people will actually know if they did or not."

Wins against a lackluster Bengals squad and a ""just here because they told me to"" Broncos squad are nowhere near enough to put him in the top 5 for me. His regular season stats are inflated as hell because of the lack of quality defenses in the AFCS and the AFC in general (although to a lesser extent).  I'm not about to tell you he's a scrub, because that's just as dumb as saying he's top 5. He belongs in 6-10 as far as I'm concerned, saying he's better than Brady, Brees, Rodgers, Rothelisberger, P.

Seahawks,3e3hw1,_MMCXII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:02:22 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think it's Rodgers at Tier 1, then Brees and Brady at Tier 1A, then everyone else.  I think what's interesting in this is that they wrap it back around to what he wants to get paid. Which is unfair. I don't think we should pay him as much as Rodgers, but Flacco money sounds good. And definitely more than Dalton.  *edit And what I mean about everyone else is that it is just too convoluted and hard to figure out. The differences in schemes. The scheduling. The defenses they face, etc. I'm ok with Wilson being 8th best for right now. As I think he'll move into the ""elite"" category next year."

Seahawks,3e3hw1,JusChilln345,-9,Tue Jul 21 19:24:47 2015 UTC,there is no question the colts team as a whole is not very good at all. the trent-trade fail was a huge miss-step in trying to create a balanced offense.
Seahawks,3e3hw1,frankthe12thtank,3,Tue Jul 21 19:27:20 2015 UTC,I'd say they should have re-assessed their offensive line and its ability to block for the run. Inserting a back expecting them to simply move the ball is easier said than done. That's one reason why I don't value the passing game as much in most offenses. When the team needs to run and can't then who cares about the passing game?....unless you win a title with it.  NOTE: The loss to the pass-happy Pats doesn't count in this case since goal line interception and whatnot.
Seahawks,3e3hw1,JusChilln345,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:32:22 2015 UTC,"That's one reason why I don't value the passing game as much in most offenses   well ya when you emphasize the opposite of the trend and exploit it in any sport, those are usually the teams that tend to excel for a long period of time.  the smash-mouth running game, the tall and rangy corners, the versatile linemen are all contributing factors."

He was calling 2 minute drills in his rookie year.  PFF found him not primarily responsible for a single sack he took in his second year. He correctly identified every pressure and blitz and made the correct adjustments on every down.  Defenses admitted to having a hard time of getting into a coverage or formation that he didn't pick up on before the snap last year.  The Colts had a 17th ranked pass blocking line that acquired a 5th(tied) best sack rate because of how good Luck is before the snap.  He was the second best passer on throws over 16 yards last season behind Aaron Rodgers.  With one of the lowest play action usages rates last season, Luck threw the most TDs and fewest interceptions on play action last season.  PFF graded him as the 5th best QB when passing under pressure last season while facing the 10th most pressure.  Luck was drafted to a team that is still recovering from a complete roster overhaul. Wilson was drafted to a team that had dynasty written all over it.  I love Russ to death for his intangibles, leadership, athleticism and jaw-dropping playmaking ability. But to think that Luck does not serve to be rated ahead of Wilson and to throw out stats to one game vs New England as your evidence is just piss-poor."

Apparently you've never watched Wilson's mic'd up segments before. Half the time he's telling Bevell what plays to run.   He was the second best passer on throws over 16 yards last season behind Aaron Rodgers.   Wilson has the most accurate deep ball, not Luck.

Seahawks,3e3hw1,Squatch11,2,Tue Jul 21 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"sando was the creator of the tiered QBs article. blount just mentions it in this ""article""."
Seahawks,3e3hw1,frankthe12thtank,0,Tue Jul 21 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"Sando created the tiers and defined them, but not even Sando graded Wilson, it was based on grades given by league personnel. This really highlights how clueless the league is IMO."
Seahawks,3e3hw1,JusChilln345,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:15 2015 UTC,it was based on grades given by league personnel.   yes i get it. i read it too. i just don't get how you are blaming blount for this. ;)
Seahawks,3e3hw1,frankthe12thtank,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, just to clarify: I'm not blaming Blount at all and instead trying to show how some of the league perceives a QB's effectiveness and how sad that is. True, Blount is worthless and I prefer to blame him for everything wrong in this universe like Jerry from Parks and Rec."
Seahawks,3e3hw1,JusChilln345,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:09 2015 UTC,ya he is just a fancy version of a summarizer.  he would be ok to read if you wanted to learn the tldr version of hawks news. he is just not appropriate when it comes to articles for this sub where the majority are die-hards.
Seahawks,3e3hw1,frankthe12thtank,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think ESPN decided to buy low and....sell lower...
Seahawks,3e3hw1,JusChilln345,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:13 2015 UTC,i think we got severely spoiled when sando was local at TNT and as the NFCwest blogger. his spreadsheets were the shit.
Seahawks,3e3hw1,frankthe12thtank,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:27 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I didn't read the spreadsheets as often as I ought to have, but that's mostly because I hate the detail involved and would rather just look at the results."
Seahawks,3e3hw1,JusChilln345,2,Tue Jul 21 21:34:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds like people are putting a lot of stock in the verbiage alone. Being ranked as a top 10 QB, at #8, means he's widely respected in the survey. Tier 1 could have been 6, 8, or 10 quarterbacks - 5 mostly seems to be an arbitrary number. Then again I can't read the article, so I could be wrong."
Seahawks,3e3hw1,Nekokeki,3,Tue Jul 21 18:52:25 2015 UTC,"OK. Let's just agree on a Tier 2 contract. Deal, Russell?"
Seahawks,3e3hw1,hawkssb04,4,Tue Jul 21 19:15:27 2015 UTC,What if the ones who voted him tier 2/3 are Seahawks cap personnel for this exact reason
Seahawks,3e3hw1,Soperypear,3,Tue Jul 21 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"That's a brilliant tactic, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off."

Seahawks,3e3ch5,SeadderalCheatHawks,12,Tue Jul 21 17:49:52 2015 UTC,Bills...at home   Looking forward to Percy getting boo'd out of the stadium.
Seahawks,3e3ch5,Awkward_Lubricant,7,Tue Jul 21 18:04:09 2015 UTC,That's assuming he is able to play and isn't injured.... or isn't cut/traded.

Seahawks,3e3ch5,CVBrownie,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"Since we played the Pats at home 3 years ago, didn't we know when we played them it would be in their house? Or is that now how the rotation works?"
Seahawks,3e3ch5,pirana6,4,Tue Jul 21 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Sometimes they play two in row at one opponents field. For example, we have played the Steelers twice since XL. Both times were at Heinz Field."
Seahawks,3e3ch5,connerc37,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:34 2015 UTC,"ah yes good point. I guess it would be boringly predictable if the schedule was decided years before, minus the two games for the previous years standings."
Seahawks,3e3ch5,pirana6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:45 2015 UTC,"I think that was actually because they slightly changed how the schedule was made at some point in between, can't remember which year. Two east coast teams got stuck with having to make 4 separate trips to the west coast all in one year (@Here, @SF, @OAK, and @SD), so they adjusted how the schedule worked slightly so that no team would have to make more than 2 trips to the west coast in a single season. That's why we played @PIT twice in a row. Should be entirely predictable now, I believe."

Seahawks,3e338b,henry_wold,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:38 2015 UTC,I hope Norwood wins the 3rd or 4th receiver spot getting most snaps at X and slot. He might be our best perimeter-ish possession receiver this year but I don't see him making big plays downfield like Kearse who's only good routes are something vertical.   I say this assuming Richardson is slow to get back.   I think that one of either Murphy and Lambert at SS will make PS and have long term potential.  Sokoli if he clears waivers. And maybe Kasen or McNeil for WR.
Seahawks,3e338b,Shitty_Thesis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:55 2015 UTC,Norwood would definitely be claimed before he reverted to our PS. I think Pinkins might make the team because he will make a big contribution on special teams this year.

The amount of irrational hatred for a fellow (likely DRUNK) 12 on the way his face looks is utterly ridiculous.  It even looks like Kanye is photoshopped into the picture.  Jesus Christ people.

It's not only television and ticket sales revenue that count towards the salary cap.  There are also merchandise, sponsorships, etc that are included in the number.  This is great for the players, as there are many avenues for money to come from.    From the Owners standpoint, they have to pay, not only the players, but coaching staff, administrative staff (think of how equipment gets from game to game), marketing staff, etc.  They also have things like stadium costs, chartered flights (in some cases the team owns the plane, but the rest of the flight incurred costs can't be capitalized, and are completely operational, like fuel), insurance costs for all of the events, and business related insurance, like insuring practice facilities.  The list goes on and on for what the owner is responsible for paying for.  We all think of the players making millions, but most players don't make that money.  At the same time, we think of the owners as rolling in the dough that they're making from the team...most don't.  This is why cities like San Diego and St. Louis are struggling to keep their team.  Otherwise, owners would happily plunk down the full cost of the stadium to have their team there.  For reference:   NFL CBA  STL and SAN Stadium Discussions"

Seahawks,3e0rgd,jenomico,12,Tue Jul 21 06:52:01 2015 UTC,"Here's a quick look at the defensive end spot for the Seattle Seahawks heading into training camp. The team has 10 players listed at the DE spot entering camp, but the Seahawks also have fullback Will Tukuafu, who also contributes at DE:  Locks: Michael Bennett, Cliff Avril, Frank Clark, Cassius Marsh. The first question is whether Bennett will show up the first day of training camp. He's unhappy with his contract and has said he might skip part of camp. But Bennett and Avril will be the starters come September. Clark is the controversial rookie but also a talented second-round draft choice of the Seahawks. The Seahawks need him to contribute immediately at a spot that lacks quality depth. Marsh missed most of his rookie year last season with a broken foot. The Seahawks have looked at him some at outside linebacker, seeing if he can make the same move Bruce Irvin made.   He got the locks correct.   Likely: Demarcus Dobbs, Obum Gwacham. Dobbs did a decent job down the stretch last season for the Seahawks and finished with 16 tackles. Gwacham is a rookie and former WR who still is learning the position. He may end up on the practice squad if the Seahawks don't want to risk losing him.   I am inclined to agree for the likelys. I'm not positive but given Obum's size and athleticism i would imagine he could earn a ST position if he really takes to it naturally in camp. But maybe there aren't enough spots open on ST for him. Not sure.    Bubble: David King, Ryan Robinson, Greg Scruggs. King played in three games for Seattle last season. The coaches love his work ethic. Robinson suffered an Achilles tendon injury in organized team activities, cleared waivers and was placed on injured reserve. Now starting his fourth season, Scruggs has played in only eight games, spending most of the past two years on IR with knee injuries.   Yup, sounds about right.    Longshot: Julius Warmsley. Warmsley spent time on the Seattle practice squad last year as a rookie out of Tulane.   Yup.   As for ""Frank Clark needs to contribute immediately""....i don't know where he got that from. Would it be fantastic if he did? Hell yes! But does he need to for us to have an effective pass rush? Lol no. We still have Bennett, Avril, Irvin, Hill, Mebane, Marsh....i mean we lost who from last year? O'Brien Schofield, that's it? We would need Frank Clark to produce if Bennett had been traded or something, but for now, whatever Frank Clark brings to the table just add to our already pretty good pass rush, making it potentially very deadly."
Seahawks,3e0rgd,M3rc_Nate,6,Tue Jul 21 02:10:29 2015 UTC,Yepppp. When I saw the article title I was wondering if someone got injured. Nope... just clickbait.
Seahawks,3e0rgd,RabbiSchlem,0,Tue Jul 21 04:33:02 2015 UTC,"He was focusing on DE and last I checked Mebane, Hill, and Irvin weren't DEs. And while you're eternally optimistic about every guy on the roster, we have no idea what Marsh will do on the field at this point.  They also need him to perform because there's been almost zero contribution from their top draft picks in the previous two years. Can't keep swinging and missing."
Seahawks,3e0rgd,Tyr64,0,Tue Jul 21 11:31:55 2015 UTC,"Lol, well you are wrong right off the bat. Marsh is focusing on Irvin's position per Pete and Marsh himself in the final pressers of mini-camp.   Cassius Marsh, drafted on '14 as DE, completes 1st day at OLB (SAM). For future flexibility, coach Pete Carroll says. Weighs in at 250 lbs (Irvin weight). Can play SAM as well as LEO like Irvin does (or is at least trying it out, seeing if he can do it well enough). Basically, Marsh went from Bennett backup (270lbs) to Bruce backup (250lbs). Clark the new Bennett backup. Obum 3rd string Bruce.    Mebane, Hill, and Irvin aren't DE's but they do rush the passer and get sacks (actually Irvin does play DE on third down, its called LEO, a hybrid between Linebacker and DE, but he gets down in a DE stance and puts his fingers in the ground and pass rushes. See here.   Marsh is hard to know what he will do on the field given his new position that he is practicing...will he still be in DE rotation? Play some snaps (when we have a winners lead) at Irvin's position to see how he does? Idk how he will be used on the field, but fact is he was starting to become an impact player before he got injured. He has since then had months and months to learn the defense like the back of his hand, to workout, to get mental reps, and now will get an entire camp to train and develop more.   Same can be said of Jordan Hill, who was really starting to come into his own and get production and then got hurt."

IMO the Seahawks should offer him a fair deal but on the low-to-medium side $ wise. That is assuming they feel confident in Gilliam or their options in the 2016 Draft class at LT. If they don't they we might have to make a competitive offer.   But overall i'd tell him ""we've paid you a shit load of old CBA money expecting a top tier LT, we got a LT prone to injuries, a billion off-side calls on you, and inconsistent play. So here is our offer, we imagine you will get offers for more elsewhere but we just can't afford to high ball you, and we hope you love Seattle and this team and this atmosphere and want to stay.

Others might want a new LT, and maybe we could be lucky and Gilliam turns out to be good enough and more consistent or a LT we draft ends up being better than Okung...but LT's are rare, and an extremely important position.

Seahawks,3dzlc8,Tyr64,15,Mon Jul 20 20:31:56 2015 UTC,Maybe that's why we drafted so many o-lineman this year
Seahawks,3dzlc8,FUCKSTORM420,8,Mon Jul 20 20:51:06 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who wouldn't mind another few years of Sweezy? Plus from what I hear Cable loves him. I know he's not perfect but I think he's the least of our worries on the line.
Seahawks,3dzlc8,_MMCXII,6,Mon Jul 20 21:47:27 2015 UTC,I personally  think he performed the best on the line last year.
Seahawks,3dzlc8,daveimprovement,5,Mon Jul 20 22:22:44 2015 UTC,I think sweezy stays unless someone overpays for him. He's really the one who fits Cables system best right now.
Seahawks,3dzlc8,dHUMANb,3,Mon Jul 20 23:05:23 2015 UTC,He is going to be overpaid.
Seahawks,3dzlc8,Drchrisco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:43:32 2015 UTC,"Eh, he's meh on pass protection in an age where there's only a few teams wanted to run. There's a better chance than most of our other position groups that he slips through."

Seahawks,3dzvx6,ridensj,4,Mon Jul 20 22:08:39 2015 UTC,Lol seriously. I hope people talked shit to him the entire time he was sitting there. He shouldn't even have been allowed to get tickets. Screw opposing fans.
Seahawks,3dzvx6,keatonisballin,4,Mon Jul 20 22:37:55 2015 UTC,The news cameras were eating him up. Every time I turned around he was being interviewed…so annoying :(

Seahawks,3dzolr,PNWQuakesFan,-7,Tue Jul 21 12:15:23 2015 UTC,"There was NO point to Sunday's lineup. None. I guess those that lined up on Sunday got actual seats for the Steelers and Lions game, but even people w/o wristbands got tickets for the Bears and 49ers and Rams and any other game that met their fancy.  The 2015 Seahawks Box Office Single Ticket Sale method was a total bust. They would have been better off letting people camp out overnight on Sunday and do the sale on Monday.  I guarantee people were in line from 10am to 9pm yesteday, then again in line today from 8am til 11am. 14 hours of waiting for someone to get tickets to a game that was available for people who showed up at 2pm today.  Hope it was worth the wait, Sunday campers."

Seahawks,3dzolr,Gunkwei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:13 2015 UTC,"You know, I waited 7 hours in line Sunday, then another 7 on Monday, all so I could get tickets to the Rams game that was apparently one of the least popular in tickets purchased. So yeah, you're right, I could've just come at like 4 on Monday and waited 5 hours or something for the same tickets. Live and learn. However, if you wanted to see the Steelers or Lions, waiting for the wristband was probably worth it."
Seahawks,3dzolr,PNWQuakesFan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"Rams tickets were available today too. That was a 1 hour wait.   14 hours of line-waiting to save at least $200 per ticket... at 4 tickets thats 800 bucks saved. Prooooobably worth it either way.  edit: although i know I got Steelers tickets today, and so did other people. Lions game was also available for a little while."

We need to keep the team cheap assuming we sign Russ and Wagner, and certain spots will need to have players on rookie deals filling them. RCB is one of those spots given our staffs ability to find and develop CB's. Right now we had to get Cary (Simon is questionable, Tye Smith is unproven and a rookie) but i dont believe he is a long term piece to our team. I wouldn't be shocked to see him get cut in 2016 and a rookie contract player (Simon, Smith) take over as RCB.   BUT i love that he loves it here, that he loves the Hawks for making him what he is and everything, and i'd love for him to retire here."
