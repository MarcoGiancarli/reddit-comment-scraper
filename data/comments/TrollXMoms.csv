I swear she actually looked sad when a few minutes later she told me they couldn't turn my breech son so there was no way to use forceps on him.  I don't know how many stitches I have or even what degree my episiotomy was or if I have other tears, I asked but either they gave me a vague shrug of the shoulders or I was too stoned to recall.

My daughter's room is where we first spotted them. It went from nothing to ""holy shit, what are these bugs and why are there so many??"" We have no idea where they came from, but we do get stuff from thrift stores and yard sales sometimes, so I'm thinking that's what it was.  Bought diatomaceous earth, those interceptor cups for under the bed posts, mattress and boxspring encasements for each bed, and a spray (that one was mostly for peace of mind because I'm not convinced they do a lot, but the reviews were favorable). We emptied our rooms, put everything cloth in huge ziplocks and threw it all outside (or in the outside garbage). We spread that powder everywhere and sprayed down all the furniture. I washed all the clothes, and washed our bed stuff daily for a week.  Since we powdered our house like a doughnut and sealed up our beds, we haven't seen a single one or had any bites. From the day we first spotted them until three days later when the supplies came in, we were seeing them constantly. I'm not convinced they're gone, but I'm hopeful that eventually they will be. Sorry for the wall of text, but I'm traumatized, lol. I think my days of buying used stuff without a care are over.  And an update: We have seen three since we took all those precautions, but I think the diatomaceous earth route takes a while. It's been a couple of weeks since the last sighting, though. Tomorrow we're throwing out our recliners (not a huge loss, they came from Big Lots and are crappy anyway) and rolling up the living room rugs and storing them in bags outside. I've been taking off our outlet covers when I get a chance, and spraying the diatomaceous earth right inside. Pretty much any ""at home remedy"" I've read about, I've tried. It's cost us about $200 plus about $500 in stuff we had to throw out. Best of luck to you!"

I had no choice but to cosleep and I did so from 8 to I wanna say 14 months? I also had to rock her to sleep. Then randomly one night I was like, ""I'm going to lay her down in her crib. If she cries, she cries. This is just an experiment."" She cried for maybe 3 minutes and passed out.    She also attends daycare though, so she's in a nap routine there which I think is one of the reasons she was able to fall asleep on her own."

All I can say is that he is slowly improving, and I hope by the time he is 18 we will be able to eat in a restaurant. ;) My dreams of kids that will eat a variety of foods have drowned in a shower of self-induced vomit.   They will eat one or two things (bell peppers and creamy vegetable soups, carrots/mushrooms in stews, peas/corn if they are hidden so they doesn't realize he is eating them), so that's what they get, mostly. I ask them to try a bite or two of other vegetables regularly. Not much success, though. We can't beat vomiting, because we don't want to clean it up anymore. Bribes sometimes work, but they'd rather skip dessert than eat vegetables most days.

It drives me crazy... He's five years old. Most of what he does or tries to do should be common sense not to do anymore. At two, i understand.. But not at five. His older brother..also five... Doesn't do anything he does so that doesn't help with my understanding of what possesses him to continue doing what he does... Fingers crossed he grows out of this and fast.

Or where he would get angry with me so he would pound his head into the wall or punch himself (that'll TEACH MOM).   He's since grown out of those.. Thankfully. That was age four.   Or where he thought it was cool to push his brothers into the burners (on the stove.. While they were still hot). That was a fun one.   Or where he wanted so badly to see what the garbage disposal felt like.. So I would catch him sticking his hand down there. This was a short lived phase.. Thankfully. We did everything to show him what happens to things went they go down there. I got so angry I almost googled pictures... Which he begged me not to do. I would panic whenever I'd be in the shower and hear the garbage disposal ... Thankfully all its ever been was my husband doing dishes (which is a shocker but hay it's not my kids hand so we're good).   We've had so many angry stages and dangerous stages. He just got over one where you're talking to him and he zones out. Like completely zoned out.. You're talking to a wall. He can't hear you and you can literally scream as loud as you can in his face and he won't budge or hear you. It's like he's not there. I think I lost it one time and just screamed and he didn't move or blink (his eyes stay wide open the whole time, it's weird). I talked to his doctor and she said it's a phase.. So keep doing what I'm doing and it'll pass. So I didn't scream at him again .. That was just the one weak moment. I would have to touch him when we spoke and ask questions to make sure he's listening and reward that behavior. It was tough.. Such a frustrating phase. And it's a dangerous one because I would tell him to stop doing something and he just plainly ""cant hear"" me. Which meant that he got hurt a couple times when he otherwise wouldn't. And then he got in trouble for not listening. That was end of age four and first two weeks of Age five... The phase lasted a solid two months and words cannot express how thankful I am for that shit to finally be over.

Places like starbucks include the caffeine amount on their website. It's about 15mg/8 oz cup vs 150mg/8 oz cup for caffeinated. Your luck will vary wildly based on the brand/blend."

Spoons are an intangible unit of measurement used to track how much energy a person has throughout a given day. Each activity ""costs"" a certain number of spoons, which might not be replaced until the next day. A person who runs out of spoons loses the ability to do anything other than rest. One of the tenets of the spoon theory is that disabled or ill people must plan their activities to ensure that every day is manageable, while healthy people have a ""never-ending supply of spoons"" and thus never need to worry about running out.  Because healthy people do not feel the impact of spending spoons, they may not realize that chronically ill or disabled people's considerations include mundane tasks such as bathing and getting dressed.

I had completely forgotten what it was like to have a period for like, two years straight, so it was a really unpleasant surprise. And it was HEAVY, but I figured that the tap had been sealed off for so long, that had to be normal. But then I had to dump out my diva cup or change a pad every half hour and even then I was overflowing. I ruined at least six pairs of pants. And it lasted for sixteen days.  Day 14 I went to the ER because I woke up dizzy with my heart going wobbly. My iron level bottomed out and I had to have a transfusion. They did a bunch of tests but they found nothing conclusive, so they gave me a bunch of hormones to stop the bleeding. Period started again a week later and was even worse. Back to hospital. Still couldn't find a reason. I had to take three packs of birth control in two weeks and I was constantly puking. Got a mirena and everything stopped except light spotting.

TrollXMoms,36pyck,Shaysdays,0,Thu May 21 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"""During puberty, melatonin rises later in the evenings so sleep onset can be delayed,"" Blunden says.  This is why we see the common scenario of teens not being able to go to sleep at a reasonable hour and then struggling to get out of bed in the morning.  ""One of the problems is that the awareness as to why this is happening is really low ‚Äì that there is a physiological change in adolescents' sleep, and that it actually isn't all their fault,"" Blunden says.  While teens sleeping in on weekends may seem lazy to their parents, to an extent they need this chance to catch-up on sleep.  Stress and anxiety can prevent teens from dozing off at night, and this effect can be compounded when they begin worrying about the fact they're not sleeping, contributing to the cycle.  Seton says that from clinical practice, the majority are simply not getting enough sleep, though around 20 per cent of the sleep-deprived teenagers are suffering from Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder or Syndrome. This means their circadian rhythm, or natural 'body clock' runs closer to 25 or 27 hours, causing them to struggle to sleep until very late at night or even the early hours of the morning.

You don't need help with the baby, you need help with everything that goes to shit for the first two weeks after the baby is born.  None of this is her fault, BTW. I am not at all ungrateful she came by, but I ended up explaining things for more time than I was helped. I was the first of her children to have a child, she'd been out of the game for over ten years. (I'm the oldest of four well-spaced siblings)   She had to ask how the diapers worked, a couple times, since she was used to pinned ones and freaked out about Velcro touching the baby. Didn't remember which cream to use on the belly button and which to use on butt. (I think after the fourth day my husband wrote BB on one and B on the bottle in sharpie) She didn't know the schedule we were establishing day by day because she was only there for 1-3 hours, so half the time I ended up waking up to greet her after only two to six hours of real sleep during 24 hours so she could help me out. I had to deal with having a third or fourth party (if my husband was home) distinguish between a hungry or tired or whatever new thing crying pattern was. She wasn't unhelpful, she tried her damnedest to help however she could. But she was kind of in the way for things I wasn't sure how to do yet, and sharing that with another person who's not there for the long haul is more confusing and stressful than helpful.  So it's a mixed blessing if they do come and stay unless they are the awesome magic kind of moms who can read you and your baby's mind. I honestly figured my mom could! But by my second kid I was like, ""I appreciate the offer more than you know. How about we figure out a weekend once the baby is six weeks old where you watch the baby for a couple hours so I can get out of the house and watch a movie instead?""  Another thing- My mom wasn't the type to say things like, ""You're still hormonal, let me just take care of the baby for you for a while,"" for pre-pregnancy childraising ideals but that is a thing I've heard other people had to go through. Honestly unless you're paying someone for help or someone volunteers to give you a day off or come by for an hour of pre-planned help like laundry or dogwalking every day you're not going to get that blissful lay-in-bed, bring me the child to suckle experience so many TV shows and movies hold out."

My mom brought me similar reports during my first pregnancy and I was skeptical then too.   Not saying anyone is outright lying, or that it couldn't be true, but I can't help but wonder if your husband isn't just not remembering, or reinterpreting cases that don't fit the narrative he wants to hear, or writing them off as unusual circumstances e.g. ""well Susan, Monica, Brandy, Nikki, Erin and Patty had drugs and were laid up for awhile, but they had other, factors and we surely won't, so I won't bother relaying that story to the wife."" (When my mother was meddling into my birth plans she did this. According to her every single woman who needed drugs or didn't hop right back up to go to work was a ""special case"" even though that was most of the women she talked to, herself included.)  I mean, let's be honest, we all have our biases and naturally do things like this when we're gathering information. Unless you put effort into making sure you get a truly representative sample and force yourself to include every bit of information you get, things like selection bias easily happen.  Also, since he's getting all this second hand, and then you're getting it third hand, I can't help but think some of these stories would change slightly if you talked directly to these women yourself. I wonder how many SOs forgot about an IV with Demerol or remember her making a few quick trips to the office as ""going back to work full time two days later.""   Edit: or, it could just be that coworkers who have stories other than this aren't telling your husband because they don't want him to be scared of the birthing process and newborn stages. They're saying ""oh yeah, it's easy. Piece of cake,"" while thinking to themselves ""poor guy, he'll find out soon enough."""

TrollXMoms,31496k,Shaysdays,4,Wed Apr 1 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"So today: Get up, make a list of things to accomplish. Get in car- nothing happens. Dead battery.  AAA shows up for a jump after 45 minutes. Alright, I can go to the DMV, drop off the charity clothes, give my friend her coffee machine back, grab some stuff at Target, and then have dinner. Promptly forget list of things I need to do and where they are.  Take my daughter to the DMV to get a driving permit, realize every other teen on vacation in town is doing the same thing- three hours on line. (But she passed, yay!) I just wasn't expecting that long on a Tuesday. Manage Target, but I forgot what I needed so I had to go through the past three days and reconstruct. Forget clothes and coffee machine.  Get home, I'm ready to make dinner, then my mom calls and asks if she can eat at our place (this sounds obnoxious but it's not- we live right near her office and it's not a problem if she has to work late, usually I save her a plate of leftovers.) And could my daughter be ready for the play? What play? The one she was supposed to tell me about, so sorry.   Okay, fine, but my husband won't be home until 10:30 and we got a big new dog I don't want to leave with the 10yo for three hours just in case. I can schlep my son with me to rehearsal at 7:30, it's not ideal but there's no school this week and he's a well-behaved kid.  So dinner is fine, but I'm making fried fish, which won't keep, so shit, I gotta move that back a half hour so it's ready when she gets off work, for about 6:20. Which means I've got to leave right after dinner for rehearsal, 45 minutes away. Might be late, but I'm usually the second one there so not a huge deal.  So I have a little time to double-check my work since I've got a half hour now and I realized- I accidentally learned the leads for a song the other singer in my band is doing, and the backups for mine! So I'm trying to get that rearranged in my head and print out new sheets for break notes when... the printer dies. WTF- now I have to hand-write everything.  Mom gets here, new dog goes slightly bonkers with happiness and gets excitable all over the kitchen floor. So everyone else is mopping while I'm cooking fish trying not to slip on the kitchen floor. (thankfully we have a rice cooker and canned black beans are easy.)  Everyone sits down to a nice dinner. It was peaceful and homey until it's over and I realize- THE FUCKING DISHES IN THE DISHWASHER ARE DIRTY. So I can't really clean up before I leave. Which sucks, because my husband works 12 hour days and while he will totally understand, I don't like leaving a mess for a) him to deal with and b) big new dog to possibly counter-jump up to.  Get as much crammed in the washer as I can, leave everything else to soak, son is ready to go, great! We are driving down Route 1 to get to rehearsal, he's singing along to my practice songs, it's quite nice. I see a notification pop up on my phone- at a glance it's ""Sorry guys, I have to bag it."" Shit shit shit... depending on who that is, rehearsal could run late. Pull over to a convenience store, and I find out that out of five members, once wrenched his back, one is out of town on emergency business, and one decided there wasn't a point. At this point I've been on the road for twenty minutes DRIVING TO REHEARSAL I KICKED MY OWN ASS TO GET TO.  So we turn around and head home, I muse about how to murder band members, and as soon as my husband gets home, I'm going to have ALL THE WINE.  Thanks for letting me vent."

TrollXMoms,2ztex6,An_angry_wife,7,Sat Mar 21 16:27:29 2015 UTC,"Random (hopefully useful) info ahead!  You should clean all coffee pots about once a month. (Depends on usage).  You can buy the cleaner from the manufacturer and use it, follow the directions. Or.....  The cheapest at home way is vinegar (you can go 100% run, I do about 50/50 vinegar to water). Pros will say run half a cycle, let it sit an hour and finish. Next let it cool, run clean water, let it cool, and repeat about 3-4 times (water to flush, not the vinegar). I typically just run my whole vinegar cycle at once.  NOTE- I put a filter in my basket. It shows the goop you cleaned out, it isn't needed, but it also keeps the scale from possibly clogging your filter hole.   For Kcup types- remove all parts like your book says, clean with vinegar and if you want to, baking soda, and citrus or hot hot soapy water.   Filter baskets in regular types are cleaned the same as above.  For pot types: You can clean your pot with ice, salt, and a lemon. (Really useful if you happened to burn coffee in it). Put 1-2 cups ice (crushed if you can) 2-3 tbs salt and your lemon. Swirl around and around for 3-5 mins, it will be very frosty. Do NOT use hot water to rinse it! (After the pot is warmed again it is fine to do so).  I only know all this because I once worked in coffee and I drink waaayyyy too much for most humans."

Throw in carrots, celery and chicken  Let boil while you throw together dumplings. Tell the toddler that she can't help you, because shit's hot.  Dumplings  2 cups of flour...supposed to be ""all purpose"" but all you have in your cupboard is enriched, so fuck it I guess.  4 teaspoons of baking soda  1 teaspoon of salt  1 egg  2 tablespoons of melted butter that you forgot until you needed it. Microwave that shit, then pour it in away from the egg. Keep your fingers crossed it doesn't scramble that goddamn thing.  A shitload of dill. You were supposed to measure a tablespoon, but the cap broke off. So a shitload it is.  3/4 to 1 cup of milk   Mix together dry ingredients, throw in egg, butter and slowly mix in milk until it's a weird lumpy consistency. Drop by the spoonful into boiling soup, turn down the heat  and let simmer for 18 minutes. Make yourself a Bacardi Limon and diet coke, and try to sit down on the fucking couch for 3 seconds. Rmember 4 minutes in that you were supposed to cover that shit, and that you didn't set a timer. Cover. Guess time. It'll probably be fuckin edible anyway.  Serve. Throw toddler's bowl into the freezer because godfuckingdamn that shit is fucking hot. Marvel in the fact that she was willing to eat any of it in general, let alone 2 goddamn bowls worth.  Realize 3 hours after you ate that that goddamn pot has been sitting on the counter. Throw away half a pot of soup because you're pretty sure if you give your husband food poisoning again he'll divorce you.  Drink all the Bacardi in the house."

TrollXMoms,2ssb35,asxestolemystash,2,Sun Jan 18 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"sounds like my parents. Latest one is ""you've got to heat her bottle, it's cold. No wonder she gets an upset tummy"". A) upset tummy was from the formula she's on plus the constipation thanks to said formula and B) the bottle is room temprature, it's summer - it's not freaking cold (and heating the water can kill the cultures in the formula). FFS woman, it's been nearly 35 years since you've raised a baby - things change!  Sorry - rant over"

TrollXMoms,2sskka,ThomsonTrio,3,Sun Jan 18 06:27:54 2015 UTC,Friday was my last day pumping at work and damn it feels so good.  Good for you for exclusively pumping for that long!!

I've taken to telling people that they're supernatural, smiling at their confused faces and walking away.   Oh and I also get this frequently:  Them: Twins??? Me: Yep! Them: Boy and a girl?? Me: Yep! Them: Are they identical?? Me: No, one is a boy and one is a girl Them: Yeah but are they identical boy girl twins? Me: ..."

TrollXMoms,2ss1ui,Scandinavel,6,Tue Jan 20 03:42:40 2015 UTC,No one has ever asked me that!? Maybe it's because we are pretty young and we both look young for our age so everyone assumes they were oopsies haha.
