Ogawa and Woshige have each won one match with this match deciding the set.  In this final match, Ogawa won round 1. Then, Woshige won round 2. Woshige probably thought the match was over and celebrated. However, there was a final round and Ogawa took advantage of Woshige's celebration by dealing a very damaging combo to take the final round.  Embarrassing moment concludes."

Prematurecelebration,3duir0,bluepepper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:01:47 2015 UTC,"The score bar at the top is not part of the game, it's overlayed probably by the competition.

Prematurecelebration,3cmqbg,xStaabOnMyKnobx,5,Thu Jul 9 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you're being downvoted. The Mavs lost DAJ and, more importantly, the opportunity to productively use that cap space. Both compounded by the loss of so many other Mav FAs. The West is brutal, the Mavs are absolutely scuttled for next year. All this because one professional athlete can't be bothered to operate as such."
Prematurecelebration,3cmqbg,Hooligan8,3,Thu Jul 9 06:06:31 2015 UTC,Getting downvoted by Clippers fans probably but it's the truth.   DeAndre Jordan single handedly destroyed the Mavs by pulling this immature stunt and now they are probably going to be forced to tank the season away.
Prematurecelebration,3cmqbg,Schneeky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:16:42 2015 UTC,Im not a huge nba fan so how does his actions tank yhe mavs so hard? Is it because we wasted time and kept money aside for him while other FA's got picked up?
Prematurecelebration,3cmqbg,Slammybutt,3,Thu Jul 9 22:29:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah basically the Mavs reserved most of their cap space for the chance to sign DeAndre Jordan.   When he said yes, they threw out all their Plan Bs and were just waiting until July 9 to sign him because of NBA rules.   However, this man-child decided to go against his own word and went back to his old team, causing the Mavs to not have a good enough team to win the competitive western conference.   Which is why tanking would be a good alternative for them so they can reload their roster and maybe get a decent young player from the draft."

EDIT: As /u/bigcountrybumgarner said, he cut himself off from his agent as well as the Mavs during that time.

Prematurecelebration,3cmqbg,rumilb,6,Thu Jul 9 14:35:13 2015 UTC,Not only that but he physically locked himself in his house with his Clippers buddies and avoided all contact with his own agent or the owner of the Mavs Mark Cuban until he could officially sign. He's a child.

Prematurecelebration,3cgj17,spamthegreat,21,Tue Jul 7 22:42:26 2015 UTC,The blue team was taking a corner kick at the last minute of the game. Scoring a goal would allow them tie the overall 2 game score. The goalie in the opponent's box was used to create additional pressure. The downside is it's easy to miss a counter attack (which we've seen in the video) but it doesn't matter when you are losing anyway.

Prematurecelebration,3cgj17,trebor04,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:41:06 2015 UTC,Yeah not sure why but the norm for Mexican soccer is to always count from 1-45 minutes and just indicate the half instead of the more standard count 1-90 and that's it.

Prematurecelebration,3bz6da,knestleknox,-21,Fri Jul 3 20:20:25 2015 UTC,"I've said this before when it was posted elsewhere. How good of a kick can it be when the keeper has time to move in completely the opposite direction, realize he guessed wrong and still make the save.  Sure it has a pretty curve. But it doesn't go in.  Also he never said it wasn't an impressive kick just that the save was more impressive. Which it is."
Prematurecelebration,3bz6da,xStaabOnMyKnobx,16,Fri Jul 3 20:57:42 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you're arguing that the skill of the keeper negates impressiveness of a kick? You're both right. It's extremely impressive for a keeper to read that curve so quickly and manage to get there in time. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a good kick. That logic just doesn't make sense. It takes so much skill to even put that much curve on a ball or even place it so accurately. He fucking did both. There's more to skill in soccer than ""the ball going in"".  And saying ""Not a particularly hard free kick,"" kind of translates to ""That wasn't an impressive kick"" in my book."
Prematurecelebration,3bz6da,knestleknox,-18,Fri Jul 3 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"technically, it wasn't kicked very hard, maybe that's what he meant because with a curve like that it would be a hard save. And I agree, it is skillful and I still can't figure out how to consistently put outside curve/knuckle curve on a ball. I just have a problem with this video being always being framed in the reference of this being a ridiculous free kick when in reality, this is an otherworldly save but people are never interested in highlight reel saves as much as they are interested in goals."
Prematurecelebration,3bz6da,xStaabOnMyKnobx,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"With a curve that hard, it's almost impossible to kick it hard. The harder the kick = the straighter it goes"

Prematurecelebration,39y48r,Sinonyx1,20,Mon Jun 15 22:21:03 2015 UTC,"not sure why the downvotes. it's not like a casual sports fan can keep up with the rules that seemingly change every season. And, if you're not from the U.S. the rules make as much sense as cricket's do to me.  yes, once upon a time there was no need to punish celebration and anything went. Then, celebration started to almost become part of the game. Dances after every play, which impeded gameplay. So, rules started filtering in. Only celebrations after scores were allowed.  So, then there came the entire dance routines with choreography for multiple teammates. So, then rules stipulating only the scoring player could celebrate.  you know the saying--give an inch and they take a mile. If you watched the dances get longer, and the taunting get more offensive you could understand the rules.  One season they completely banned celebration altogether. But, with the emotion involved in game play it was too draconian. You get excited when you score. Not showing any emotion was too strict, so the rules were relaxed.  Now, throw in the mix NCAA football vs NFL football. the rules vary between uni and pro, with uni rules promoting sportsmanship and being much more strict on celebration.  so, yes there is a distinct possibility a flag for celebration was thrown. depends on the year as to what rules are being enforced. but, if you saw the antics that led to the rules you'd understand why they were in place."

Prematurecelebration,39y48r,Thoumas,6,Tue Jun 16 00:27:34 2015 UTC,"The rule says the penalty kick is valid as soon as the ball's motion is the result of the initial kick.  You are 100% right when you say ""As soon as the keeper catches it, the ball is dead."" Because when the ball is catched the initial motion is stopped and the ball is no longer in play.  But in this clip the goalie didn't clearly catch the ball, it slipped through his hand. Hence the ball was still in play and the goal is valid. Maybe unfair, but that's the cost for prematurely celebrate :)"

In smash bros, if you fall ""off"" the stage, you lose. Ganadorf was about to fall off the state, but Robin was on the platform that was leaving the stage faster, so Robin actually fell off first and lost."
Prematurecelebration,38vxs5,StupidGeek314,3,Sun Jun 7 16:03:53 2015 UTC,Ganondorf manages to jump back into the screen just before the very end of the round.
Prematurecelebration,38vxs5,PhantomLord666,2,Mon Jun 8 06:44:24 2015 UTC,Eh? Where? What am I looking at?
Prematurecelebration,38vxs5,filthgrinder,15,Sun Jun 7 13:22:25 2015 UTC,The guy with the blue cape (Robin) was kicking the crap out of the one with the red cape (Ganondorf).  Robin launched Ganondorf off-screen and thinks he's won the round by doing that. So he then does a taunt (non-combat action/pose) and the platform slides off the screen. The game then declares the one in the red cape as the winner because he just manages to jump himself back on-screen.
Prematurecelebration,38vxs5,PhantomLord666,3,Sun Jun 7 14:52:40 2015 UTC,"In Super Smash brothers the goal is to knock your opponent off the stage, killing them. Hitting an enemy weakens them and causes them to get knocked back by your attacks more and more, so after you do enough damage you can send them really flying.  If you go far enough in any direction on the stage, you die. So you can kill another character by hitting them extremely hard so that they just go flying off the screen to the left or right, or even the top of the screen. But they can also die by falling, which is what was about to happen to Ganendorf in the gif. The other character (Robin) had racked up enough damage to send Ganendorf flying off the stage far enough that his jump abilities couldn't carry him far enough to land back on the main stage. So he's seconds away from plummeting to his inevitable death on the bottom of the screen.  Since Robin knows Ganendorf doesn't have the ups to make it back alive, he performs a taunt just to rub salt in the wounds. Taunts serve no purpose in the game and it's just an animation that plays when you press a button of your character showing off, just as a middle finger to whoever you just killed.  In this case though Robin is performing his taunt on a moving platform. On this particular arena the platforms will fly off the stage sometimes, and it just so happens that Robin initiates his taunt right before one of those times. Normally a player would be able to react when they see where the stage is going and jump off to safety, but the taunt animation can't be cancelled so the player can only watch as the platform carries their character past the edge of the screen, which kills him. So he kills himself by accident a second or two before the other character would have died by falling to their death on the bottom of the screen, all because he celebrated early and decided to taunt his opponent."

Prematurecelebration,38we0k,Qckrply,7,Sun Jun 7 20:13:22 2015 UTC,"Video game commentators do two things: Explain the more technical stuff to those that may not know much about the game, and add hype. These guys weren't good at that, but a lot of the more famous commentators in the Smash scene (D1, Wife, Toph) are really good at it, and are very enjoyable to listen to. However, sometimes the commentators go insane and you get stuff like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dT836HvP3Y"
Prematurecelebration,38we0k,rico90909,4,Sun Jun 7 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"Is this more common for smash commentators?

I've never seen these explanations in the smash scene, but I've admittedly seen a very little amount of tournaments."
Prematurecelebration,38we0k,Qckrply,4,Sun Jun 7 23:17:01 2015 UTC,It's a mix of everything. Usually these tournaments for smash run pretty long. Sometimes commentators go into detail about certain matchups or the quirks of some characters or moves. But often the game moves pretty fast so hype and talking about the player's overall strategy takes precedent.
Prematurecelebration,38we0k,Johnny_Gossamer,-1,Sun Jun 7 23:20:27 2015 UTC,"> other fighting-game matches, like street fighter or mortal combat, commentators usually explain the moves, setups and the reasoning why something was impressive, as if their audience are new to the game.  smash is a much more intuitive game to watch than other fighters, even if you don't know much about the intricacies of the engine. It's a physics based game unlike other fighters, and it's relatively easy to understand at a spectator level.  When something is impressive or disrespectful in smash, it's actually  pretty obvious just because of how elegantly the game's combo system is designed."

Prematurecelebration,37v6ay,powerchicken,17,Sat May 30 21:42:27 2015 UTC,"I know people always make a fuzz about it, but can't we give it a rest already? I love football, and I don't give it even a single thought when someone calls it soccer, at least, not until someone makes the ""achum, it's actually football"" comment. People call this particular kind of football ""Futsal"", when in my country we just call this (directly translated) ""hall football"", so calling this Futsal makes me cringe more (if at all) than when an American calls Football ""soccer"". That's just how they pronounce it. To be honest, people who keep coming back to this argument just seem to want to belittle Americans because they have a vastly different sport culture than the rest of the world and they somehow feel the need to focus on alienating them further from the sport, as if they're somehow different soccer fans because of the way they call it. Just get over it already. /rant-ish"
