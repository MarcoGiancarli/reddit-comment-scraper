PhotoshopRequest,3dvwfw,a_Light_Umbrella,2,Mon Jul 20 05:23:39 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. Your colorization looks to me like a real color photo from 1975 saved until now. That's really cool in a realistic sense. Thanks!

PhotoshopRequest,3dvwfw,CentaurOfDoom,3,Sun Jul 19 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"I can colorize if you give me details on the colors. Eye color, hair color, clothes color, the more the better.  EDIT: Nvm... Saw the comment below."

And you, being a guy (I'm assuming) you probably don't know a whole lot about makeup and I doubt you could get this out of your wife without her really being like, ""What the ever loving fuck?"" Anyway here's my two tries. I used a_light_umbrella's t-shirt and green foliage colorization (good job btw I know that took forever). Imgur #1 Pink Undertones ;   Imgur #2 Peach Undertones"

PhotoshopRequest,3dvwfw,LukeIsAPhotoshopper,2,Mon Jul 20 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping to present this picture framed for my wife on her birthday in August. It's the only surviving picture of her parents and it is in pretty bad shape on the edges. Anything you can do would be great. If someone feels like colorizing it after it is repaired that would be over the top. I don't know anything about this stuff so I don't know what expectations are realistic, so whatever you can do to make this look as good as possible I will be super thankful for. Thanks in advance. Very excited to see what I have waiting for me when I come back in a few days."
PhotoshopRequest,3dvwfw,LukeIsAPhotoshopper,2,Sun Jul 19 23:45:29 2015 UTC,"For colorizing, we would need the colors of the clothing, items and people. I recommend giving the colors and then providing current color pictures of you and your wife."

Both pretty fair skinned. This is all from childhood memory so she can't remember much. And I can't press for more without her being like ""wtf?"" Also, this was taken circa 1975 so the colors would be as expected for the times (hence we think the suit was brown). Thanks!"
