He also needs someone in teamspeak to properly explain the game. Last time Bikeman didn't do a very good job, and Waffle told him the game was very difficult because he spent almost all his playthrough by binding keys to his joystick.   OP asked that exact same question three months ago.   I don't know what you mean by that. I just posted this epic video. No question asked."

How neat would it be for twitch to implement the option for .gifs & .webm into the video player banner. It would be mostly useless, but it could spice up a channels design when the broadcaster is offline.  Just imagine, Lirik goes offline & we're left with not the static ""Stream is currently offline"" page we've all grown used to, but instead a looping gif of Lettuce Cat sleeping beneath a whiteboard which has ""Stream if currently offline"" written on it, occasionally getting up to go eat catfood, play with a ball or use a scratching pole & then returning to where she was before.  I think it could be neat, but might be a little over the top. Essentially a glorified screensaver! lmao"

DatGuyLirik,3dsnra,Lawliet117,4,Sun Jul 19 16:36:50 2015 UTC,"I admire his professionalism: he's always been very discreet and tight-lipped when it comes to anything relating to money or being a pro streamer, always trying to maintain the image that he just does it for fun and doesn't care about the money or success. Most people would just brag or ""let slip"" how great things are, which is an awful PR move."
DatGuyLirik,3dsnra,gg4444,4,Sun Jul 19 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason for his huge success is because of this. He is literally so level headed. When he was on dropped frames or whatever, it seemed as if they were trying to make him disclose some wealth info or like, how good his success was to him but he remained so composed and I think it's not something he HAS to do, it's just him as a person and his personality.  Probably all stems from the fact he streams to entertain, not to make bank (Even though he probably does)"
DatGuyLirik,3dsnra,Portrend,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:10:37 2015 UTC,He streams because it's his job but I honestly feel like he enjoys the fuck out of it.  A stand up comedian will never complain about not having a normal 9-5 like most of us have.  The only phenomenon I see with lirik doing this is how he doesn't get burned out from playing games for 8 hours a day 6 days a week.  That is fucking intense.  That when it becomes a 9-5 for him.  The line between streaming for bank and streaming for fun is thin.
DatGuyLirik,3dsnra,0b4m4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:20:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe there is a mentality from him that it is his job and that's what stops him from getting burned out. Remember he only plays games he wants to play, even when the subs vote on Sunday if Lirik thinks the game is trash he wont play it for long, and this is a big part of how he can maintain playing for so long - They're games he's interested in playing! :D"

If the UI is clean i stay if they are funny or commantates on gameplay.

DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,SLVRRR,2,Sun Jul 19 08:25:01 2015 UTC,"Having too much shit on the screen while playing the game throws me off. I don't know why people think thats the way to do it because it takes the focus away from the gameplay. I also really like the non-cam style Lirik has, gives the focus to the game and what he's saying."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,Pedarsen,4,Fri Jul 17 16:41:21 2015 UTC,All that text just to say that it's hard to become a successful streamer and that you shouldn't necessarily buy expensive equipment. Alrighty then.
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,HeexX,3,Fri Jul 17 23:52:27 2015 UTC,"Earlier was - Stream for fun and success will come 100%, eventually. Until like year ago - Stream for fun, dont expect anything but perhaps you will have success. Now it's - Stream for fun, you will never succeed except if you are cute looking girl or you have big streamer to shoutout and you still need to justify fact that you can entertain everyone.  EDIT: No matter how quality content you provide if your viewer count is low people will not stay. That is a fact and everyone who think otherwise are without experiance. Especially if you have on mind that streamer need interaction and streaming for noone while random person join and that same viewer expect some dialog as bigger streamers do is kinda weird."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,Schnappi07,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:38:12 2015 UTC,"Yea it's really hard for early streamers.  Unless you got some niche or you're like a pro at a specific game with an abundance of viewers, starting at the bottom of the barrel is hard.  I think the only way to be successful nowadays is to literally be pro a the game you're playing (excluding already saturated games like sc2, league, csgo, dota2, etc...) like Camgears.  I watch a few old streams for the past few years that have only grown 10k-15k followers.  So it's really hard."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,airikewr,7,Sat Jul 18 07:41:07 2015 UTC,"I agree and, I wrote exactly this (not in so many words) during their argument about sound quality. Almost everyone who wants to stream has 'ok' setups nowadays, which leads to the setup arguably holding less importance.  You need to find your niche or style that feels natural to you and the viewers. If you have two people with the same style and personality of course you choose the one with the better setup, but otherwise I find it more important with the actual person behind the stream."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,E38V12,5,Fri Jul 17 14:56:54 2015 UTC,Most streamers started for the fun of it. Lirik said 'if you stream for money you're a fuck'. So not everyone is expecting to make money back.
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,l0st_t0y,4,Fri Jul 17 15:55:01 2015 UTC,"You basically just need good enough quality for people to be able to hear what you are saying clearly and to be able to tell what is going on in whatever game you are playing. After that, a streamer has to have a kind of personality that can attract viewers and they usually need to interact with chat a lot. If you have all of that then the hardest part is just getting your name out there which is a bit harder to do today than when Lirik started."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,l0st_t0y,3,Fri Jul 17 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"Basically what I wanted to say but very concise plus you don't need an expensive mic, amp, or mixer to do that."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,0b4m4,2,Fri Jul 17 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah another way to attract viewers is just to be really good at a popular game like Dota, LoL, and CS:GO, but usually you also need a bit of personality added into your stream too."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,Sixteenarmed,5,Fri Jul 17 21:57:23 2015 UTC,I stream because i can. Not because im looking for success.  I get bored of actually playing video games after 2 or 3 hours.  I don't know how lirik does it.  I can watch him all day tho.
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,Schnappi07,3,Fri Jul 17 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"Me either, I find enjoyment watching people play video games than playing them myself recently. lol"
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,QUSHY,4,Sat Jul 18 07:42:52 2015 UTC,"When I join a low viewer Stream and the Streamer sounds like he streams right out of a public restroom, I leave. Sound quality is important to me, and people who like to stream want a good quality anyway."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,SgtKeeneye,11,Fri Jul 17 14:04:17 2015 UTC,A $50 mic is fine but not like a $150 mic + mixer + amp.
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,lobster_liberator,6,Fri Jul 17 14:05:44 2015 UTC,In fact 10-15$ headphones with software like VSTHost or Adobe CC can make quality pretty much as it's summit for example if not even better. It's easy for people who have money to buy stuff and then other think that its requirement for good quality.
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,lobster_liberator,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:43:02 2015 UTC,Totally.  Definitely can be a want but definitely not a need.
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,Mari0us,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:41:44 2015 UTC,What do you mean but not like a $150 mic etc? That should be fine too
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,MrZappa8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:54 2015 UTC,$150 mic is not needed but can be wanted.  Same with a $1000 mic.  A Yeti is probably the cheapest mic that's needed to sound somewhat clear.
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,SLVRRR,2,Tue Jul 21 02:21:10 2015 UTC,"I guess, but where I live rent, utilities, tuition, and food is a lot of money.   Another $300 is a lot.   I saved to be able to get good internet and a decent computer.  Unless it's absolutely necessary, I think an investment is only good if you know you can make a return on it.   There's no such thing as investing in a hobby, unless somehow you're able to make money off that hobby.  Most hobbies are purely for fun.  If you absolutely know you'll become a successful streamer, by all means invest."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,SLVRRR,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:36:04 2015 UTC,"Well, if people have the money to invest, by all means do it lol.  For people who don't and want to be successful in streaming should not.  It's about how much money you have to spend.  If you're rich, do whatever you want.  I'm just trying to prevent upcoming streamers that look up to Lirik or Waffle thinking they need all this tech to become more successful than the next upcoming streamer.  It'll definitely help along the way after you've kind of made it, but no way in hell do you need that anytime soon."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,redbull666,2,Fri Jul 17 14:55:24 2015 UTC,Of course im pretty sure that is common knowledge. Unless you already have a an established community else where that will come like YouTube then you just need a Decent set up. A blue snowball and be somewhere there isnt a shit ton a background noise or get a make a noise gate would easily do the trick.   However like the guy mentioned if this is your hobby which is something you love doing then having high quality streams is something you can invest into whether you want make money in the end or not.  Just because they do not want to be successful doesn't mean they don't get enjoyment out of what they produce at okay or high levels.   At the end of the day invest whatever amount of money you want to invest because it what YOU want to do. Not because someone said you should or shouldn't for whatever reason.
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,dejurka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:07:54 2015 UTC,"Totally.  I just want to stop any upcoming streamers that think getting all hi-tech with their equipment = successful streamer.  Lirik and Waffle made it really adamant that it's something you need.  If ABC streamer wants to and has the money, by all means."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,dejurka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:14:50 2015 UTC,"Fastest way to get a big following is to leech off the success of a big name streamer. Playing with them once will get a viewership that normally takes months to develop. I can name about 3-4 streamers that goldglove created out of nowhere. Fairlight actually started by streamstalking goldglove and then became friends with him. Big streamers have a ton of influence in helping small streamers.  All that fancy stuff helps, but as long as your hardware isn't stopping people from joining, the hard part is the dedication in growing an audience"
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,KickinWingz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yea but streamstalking isn't really taken lightly these days.  Especially with high profile streamers, so it can actually backfire sometimes."
DatGuyLirik,3dmgy4,kratier,2,Fri Jul 17 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"I don't mean streamstalking in the annoying sense (i.e. following lirik around interrupting gameplay yelling ""HI LIRIK HI HI"") but pretending you don't know who the streamer is and not ruining their game and going along with the gameplay like normal. Being annoying just works out worse for you. Leave if you're not wanted, help if they don't mind the help (again without ruining gameplay)."

DatGuyLirik,3ddabv,WallusTheWalrus,15,Wed Jul 15 10:59:35 2015 UTC,"Still blows my mind how Lirik's channel exploded after the release of DayZ SA. Fully deserved though, congratulations."
DatGuyLirik,3ddabv,Veenux,4,Wed Jul 15 11:12:03 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate more? How much did his channel grow after DayZ?
DatGuyLirik,3ddabv,JackCarver,14,Wed Jul 15 13:14:07 2015 UTC,"Lirik was basically the go-to place to see how fun a DayZ session could be. I'm pretty sure most of us watched him because of the huge laughs we got out of the randomness of DayZ. I remember that around that time he started breaking 10k live viewers, especially when he played recently released singleplayer games. (TLOU comes into mind)"
DatGuyLirik,3ddabv,igotinfected,3,Wed Jul 15 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"When i started watching him he would do bandit challenges set up by his subs on sundays. He would have to give away his shit to random ppl and had other goals. That shit had me laughing so hard, i wish he would bring it back!"
DatGuyLirik,3ddabv,rnplyr1985,5,Wed Jul 15 16:49:59 2015 UTC,"The graph at the bottom of this page shows a steady increase in subs that largely appears to have started in line with the DayZ SA release (Dec 2013).  http://socialblade.com/twitch/user/lirik  That said, he hasn't been playing DayZ very much at all, until recently, and yet the follow count continues to increase. While DayZ SA could be argued to have been the catalyst for growth, I think it's fair to say it isn't the only reason, especially given it hasn't been his 'main game' for quite some time."
DatGuyLirik,3ddabv,dave1up,5,Wed Jul 15 13:30:24 2015 UTC,"DayZ definitely isn't the reason why he is so popular. But DayZ SA was the reason why he got exposed to so many people, because the hype for that game was immense. People just liked his stream so much that they stayed even after he started playing other games again."
DatGuyLirik,3ddabv,Veenux,5,Wed Jul 15 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"Lirik was already a very established streamer before DayZ SA and averaged around 4k viewers. But the day SA hit he had over 20k if I remember correctly. At that time I thought ""this will probably go down, once the DayZ SA hype has settled down again"", but it didn't. He actually gained even more viewers since then."
DatGuyLirik,3ddabv,Veenux,45,Wed Jul 15 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"This is great and all, but it's honestly sort of shitty that it happened while he was offline."

DatGuyLirik,3ddabv,Blacerrr,2,Wed Jul 15 20:04:06 2015 UTC,"IMO I honestly find it kind of dumb that Syndicate helped to get the last few hundred followers. It would've happened today anyways without anyone's help. No one asked him to do so and I honestly think that Lirik is not really liking that anyways. I mean, he is trying to be a nice guy, but the fact that he raided an offline stream feels kind of sad to me."

DatGuyLirik,3ddabv,Blacerrr,-2,Wed Jul 15 12:57:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he knows what he is doing too, I still find it kind of weird.

Like Artwork, there is no set superior. @GuthGFX comment, when interpreted, was looking entirely for feedback which would be based largely on opinion. Stating that lirik's opinion is preference is just stating the obvious and does not serve to help."

DatGuyLirik,3d881j,GuitarIpod,7,Tue Jul 14 09:02:03 2015 UTC,the reason the woman was speechless after he said the amount was because he re muted his mic incase she read any information out.  He unmuted it for the amount to allow the stream to hear he had donated the right amount.

DatGuyLirik,3d15lm,baramgood,3,Mon Jul 13 04:23:04 2015 UTC,That's very fucked up.  You guys are pathetic.
DatGuyLirik,3d15lm,Niklas11,6,Sun Jul 12 19:51:11 2015 UTC,Thats not fucked up. Sodas community is based on spamming dumb shit and shitting all over soda.  He himself encourage it as well. This is just standard sodapoppin chat. 90 % of the reason people sub to soda is to avoid slow/sub only mode so they can shit on him even more.  It'd be fucked up if was spammed in any other channel but sodas.

Before his channel got approved for partnership twitch partners had a overall pretty high standard.   Now so many channel are just built around being retarded and telling the broadcaster to get cancer and hope they get hit by a bus.   Which really just bring the standard of twitch to a new low. Just look at how 99 % of girl streamers has the gimmick of ""Oh someone subbed - lemme go write their name on a board behind me and totally not show off my cleavage as I get out of the char and totally not show off their ass as they walk to the board behind them.""  And the entire CSGO section on twitch is basically just a fucking advertise for gambling for underage kids."

DatGuyLirik,3cx88o,Maggost,4,Sat Jul 11 19:54:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. Didn't really catch that much of this one but from what I saw lirik did a good job at keeping his spirits up and the content entertaining, which I can imagine is not an easy task. When it's for a specific reason like charity, however, (don't know if the 24h stream or the charity idea came first or if charity was the idea from the start, but it doesn't matter), it's a good format. People can check in when they have time and see how it's going and throw in some money here and there. I think it's an amazing thing to see how generous people can be. Big cred to lirik and everyone who donated. In general though, I feel 24h streams are a bit of a waste, but it's still enjoyable and everyone should just take away from them what they will."

Lirik broke his initial target goal well before this time if I remember yet its hard to argue when in the proceeding 12 he more than doubled it.

I prefer this over daily steam, because he do things and play games he normaly wouldn't bother to check (maybe not this time) but you're right its only worth it if there is a reason, you can't do it too often and we have been waiting long time since last 24h.

Also, yes I did watch a few of his streams but I had to leave after a few minutes because of how cringy it was. It's kinda sad too that he is 23 years  old, has no job and lives at his mother place isn't it.  Funny thing is before he was streaming you could hear Lirik's stream echo in the background and when he first got exposured he said he didn't know who Lirik was lol. He was streamstalking and crawling up Lirik's ass since Asylum.

Sayeed might or might not have gotten his partnership through association with Lirik, the fact of the matter is that he does enough outside of popping up on Liriks streams to have people still tune in to his stream.  Besides which the vast majority of streamers get noticed because a pre existing audience sees them in another stream and then decides to check them out.  I only ever found Lirik because he done a night stream with Summit, i only found out about Waffle because of a night stream with Lirik, i only knew about Summit because of mEclipse, i only knew about Northern Lion because of Quill18 and so on and so forth.  If a streamer is genuinely just riding on the coat tails of someone better than them, then given enough time they will lose their initial boosted audience and go back to being regular gamers who cannot stream for a living."

DatGuyLirik,3cyfmr,Laiserg,2,Sun Jul 12 08:56:46 2015 UTC,24 hour League of Legends stream is confirmed for 1 million followers

DatGuyLirik,3cxiyj,CharmExclusive,3,Sat Jul 11 17:43:18 2015 UTC,"$42,500 when the stream went off"
DatGuyLirik,3cxiyj,Namjax,6,Sat Jul 11 17:46:29 2015 UTC,And 50% of sub money and 1k from his own pocket. So i guess at least over 45k.
DatGuyLirik,3cxiyj,Pedarsen,4,Sat Jul 11 17:48:39 2015 UTC,He doesn't get all the money from subs. Twitch typically takes a 50% cut but I'm pretty sure Lirik has a special deal. He probably gets around 75% of the total amount...
DatGuyLirik,3cxiyj,Panosgads,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:57:59 2015 UTC,Oh yes I know he only gets some and twitch takes another percentage. But he said he was going to pay for the full $5 so idk
DatGuyLirik,3cxiyj,xen0cide,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:05:36 2015 UTC,It would be really cool of twitch if they do such a thing and if you guys havent donated and want to donate the link will be there till monday

DatGuyLirik,3cxiyj,xen0cide,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:14:09 2015 UTC,Know I am kinda late but he said when he wakes up he will update the amount in the description of the stream and post on twitter.  On Monday's stream (since he is not streaming Sunday) he will manually donate the amount that was made through subscriptions and the 1k he pledged.

DatGuyLirik,3cw6dq,Schnappi07,7,Sat Jul 11 07:42:29 2015 UTC,"Trying to park with a trailer is 100% different than just reversing a car. People in chat just like to pretend they are experts at everything without actually knowing about it. It took me a while to get used to parking my trailer in the driveway. You have to reverse in the opposite direction you would normally, its weird."
DatGuyLirik,3cw6dq,FAWKS-HOUND,-2,Sat Jul 11 08:00:40 2015 UTC,Well yes its 100% other way around so..not so hard to park. If you think about it it's pretty easy just turn wheels opposite way and dont be too fast
DatGuyLirik,3cw6dq,OneOfTheBestNames,7,Sun Jul 12 08:49:40 2015 UTC,"Chat think they are experts at fucking parking a truck - my dad is a truck driver, and I've sat in his truck on his long distance journies - it is FUCKING hard, even driving one is hard, you need to take big swings when turning, it's not some Fiat that will never flip over, also, you need to be able to trust your side mirrors and blind spots, if you miss a car and you try to change lanes, both you and the driver of that car are most likely doomed, and a collision is going to happen.  You have to reserve in the opposite direction, you also need to take it slow and actually trust your side mirrors, one mistake, you're most likely going to be sacked from your job."

DatGuyLirik,3cw6dq,Deroni76,3,Sun Jul 12 08:50:51 2015 UTC,"gotta trust your side mirrors! but also reversing out of places is a pain like say.. you dropped off a delivery to a construction site and gotta reverse back out onto a road, you can't exactly see oncoming traffic with side mirrors alone. usually have say a second guy or something just to help you and stop traffic and such. and driving in real life and ingame are two different things, emotions and anger and such can have consequences. --- Also know a guy who was depending just on his side mirrors and the house became narrow so he reversed into it."
DatGuyLirik,3cw6dq,Deroni76,3,Sat Jul 11 07:58:59 2015 UTC,"Dude, you can't say you've never driven and then say 'it's fucking ez'...even I know it's hard as shit and I've never driven a day in my life.  I've had to do it on ETS2 and I can say it's a chore...so usually I just skip the trailer parking for the cost of points. Eventually I'll learn if I have enough patience.  Big props out there to truckers though."

DatGuyLirik,3ckbxm,Vanquishhh,-6,Wed Jul 8 18:52:48 2015 UTC,doctors with borders isnt much better they have been aiding Hamas a terrorist organization with over 1 billion $ (the second richest in the world after isis).  Sources:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/4305519/Israel-Hamas-hijacking-Gaza-aid.html   http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/gaza-one-year-after-2014-war-abject-misery-across-gaza-and-west-bank?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=social  blaming Israel for the lack of supplies to Gaza even though Hamas is making its people starve to death while its leaders are enjoying luxury suits around the Mediterranean sea.   former Hamas member speaks about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKbvrrqogQ  Brooke Goldstein on the same topic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUpGFMoPtjA  Non of you probebly even care but as someone who grew up 15 years under daily Hamas bombings in South Israel it completely breaks my heart.
DatGuyLirik,3ckbxm,Goldenkidney,7,Thu Jul 9 02:29:25 2015 UTC,What the fuck are you talking about? Because a terrorist organization hijacked Gaza aid then a charity organization is somehow at fault for aiding people in Gaza? Your first story literally says nothing about DWB. The second story was them going in after Gaza was destroyed.
DatGuyLirik,3ckbxm,Vanquishhh,-3,Thu Jul 9 02:34:38 2015 UTC,"I saw you reply on my comment too so ill just respond here. The red cross and the UN are guilty at it too. If you were to read both articles to the fullest you would have understood what I meant. The wording DOB is using in that article clearly indicated a biased and an anti against Israel that is an attitude that a claimed to be ""neutral"" pure charity organization cannot take. DOB has been treating Hamas fighters in the 2008-9 crisis according to ""Terrorism: International Case Law Reporter 2008, Volume 2"". You know I shouldn't have said anything because this topic is so sensitive to people that know so little about it. Something I should add here to make you understand why the wording of DOB bothers me so much; Gaza went down hard after the 2006 elections where they chose Hamas to take the lead meaning that they officially disconnect from Israeli responsibility even till this day Gaza gets free water, gas, and electricity from Israel and Egypt.  Articles about the elections that changed the reality in Gaza (note that these are not some biased israeli articles):  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/26/AR2006012600372.html   http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5622/palestinians-vote-hamas"

DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,somack87,26,Wed Jul 8 17:56:19 2015 UTC,"For me personally it's because he doesn't really use any gimmicks, just plays games and is a funny guy. It also helps his voice is easy to listen too."
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,Calgarydan98,3,Wed Jul 8 18:57:46 2015 UTC,I think the voice does add a lot to that.
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,w3sp,13,Thu Jul 9 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"Firstly, he's been streaming for years - so his dedicated fan base makes up a large portion of it. Secondly, he has a set schedule and is consistent, unlike most streamers. And lastly (for me), when Lirik plays his signature games, he nails the RP and entertainment right on the head like with A3L or DayZ. Can't get enough and have been watching for ~2.5 years"
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,cowboychicken,11,Wed Jul 8 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"Many reasons, each for each person. For me it is the no HUD so i can enjoy the game as well.  Cam is cool but it kill imersion for me. And he is funny as hell."
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,yonixw,3,Wed Jul 8 21:34:36 2015 UTC,True...not so much ego. Why does a streamer think I want to see their ugly face?
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,dried_meat,9,Thu Jul 9 13:19:36 2015 UTC,"As a nonsub I really love Sub Sundays, because he plays different games every week, not only this BS LoL and CSGO."
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,xMatityahu,7,Thu Jul 9 00:16:33 2015 UTC,"He just seems a like a normal, approachable person.  He doesn't make a big fuss about subs and donations unless warranted, he doesn't have any fake reactions and he is genuinely good at a lot of games he plays. (Aside from the puzzle sections Kappa)  Now I could say this is all luck, but it's not, it's pure dedication. He streamed while he was in college, I'm pretty sure he even streamed on the day of his graduation, he's put his heart and soul into streaming and honestly, after having streamed myself for a while that takes a tremendous amount of effort not to get burned out on chat acting retarded or people purposely trolling you in multiplayer games.  Say what you will about him, but he's earned every bit of success he's gotten.  Signed, a dirty non-sub."
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,ZettaSlow,3,Thu Jul 9 15:24:37 2015 UTC,"He doesn't eat on stream...that's good manners.  I get the feeling that if he came to your house for dinner, he would compliment the meal and then help with the dishes."
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,dried_meat,4,Thu Jul 9 13:23:14 2015 UTC,"I like the variety of games and his streaming times are usually perfect for me as EU.  His nightstreams tend to be great too, and in general I see myself sharing opinions somewhat often with him."
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,draanexle,6,Thu Jul 9 01:48:15 2015 UTC,he does not make hiself a whore for his viewers.
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,Dr-GimpfeN,3,Thu Jul 9 00:30:10 2015 UTC,He rules his chat with an iron fist. He is not worried about offending anyone and calls people out on their bullshit. People respect that.
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,dried_meat,3,Thu Jul 9 13:21:01 2015 UTC,"While being hilarious, he's also very good at gaming (esp H1Z1 battle royale)...and he's also funny/good at being bad at gaming. So, to summarize, he's funny and good (and bad) at games...if that's not a recipe for success on twitch, I dont know what is.  Did I just make any sense at all?"
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,dried_meat,2,Thu Jul 9 13:14:46 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best way to describe it.  Even when he is terrible at a game he will make it fun and entertaining.  When it is a game he is good at, he doesn't act like an ass but instead makes it fun/dramatic/hilarious.  I would also add (at least for me), it is the interactions he has with other players and streamers. The constant banter between him, Shortty and Waffle always puts a smile on my face.  It reminds me when my friends and I are playing board games.  His night streams made me WISH I had friends to casually play random video games with (instead of always wanting to play popular competitive games)."
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,Gearjock,2,Thu Jul 9 17:46:13 2015 UTC,"I like the length of his stream as well as most of the other reasons people have said, like the lack of overlays, cams, etc - Streamers who stream like 2 hours and then complain they're knackered really annoy me. Especially when they have no set schedule and have a like 15 minute segment at the end of their stream asking people to support the channel. Got a streamer in mind but I won't mention his name."
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,AlzuraOS,2,Thu Jul 9 11:25:41 2015 UTC,"He is always on schedule (I think this is a really important reason), he is hilarious and reacts really funny to all kinds of things (ingame or chat), plays a lot of games, he has his own opinion is not a sheep and also he is really skilled in shooter games."
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,Naratik,2,Thu Jul 9 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"The fact that he streams variety games is a big plus, along with the fact that he focuses on gameplay, which means that I very much enjoy that he doesn't have a webcam. But the major thing for me is that given how popular he is, he gets subs and donations many times throughout the day, and he doesn't stop and read off every single one like an idiot (cough summit cough), which makes his stream very watchable. Oh and his subtle humor, makes me crack up plenty of times."
DatGuyLirik,3ckr6y,atomsej,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"Personally I enjoy his ''just do it'' attitude towards games (especially in A3L), his fairly easy-goingness with chat, the fact that he has a minimalistic hud, his playing of a variety of games so it doesn't ever get stale, and he doesn't have ANY SHITTY MUSIC playing like pretty much every other streamer."

DatGuyLirik,3cgdzx,lehsmiT,3,Tue Jul 7 18:28:43 2015 UTC,Potato aim started back when Lirik ran into African Guy and 3 UK guys in DayZ standalone.  I would say this was around January 2014 or so.  (This is from what I remember)
DatGuyLirik,3cgdzx,comment23,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:12:47 2015 UTC,"While i was researching for this VOD i have come up to other people saying it was around 2 weeks after the games release which gives us the dates of 16 January 2013 to 1 January of 2014, if it was the new year stream Lirik and chat would have remembered it so it must be between those days. If it was the first the first day then again he would remember it, since it is a remarkable day, if we even take a bit of risk, it is probably not in the first 2 days of release. Lirik played DayZ:SA on 17th so that gives us the date of 19th of January. Starting from that day and there is around 63 hours of footage. There are no official highlights of it neither on youtube and twitch channels of lirik. All i have an audio file of the guy saying ""potato aim"". I thought it could be a cool little ""gift"" for lirik to find his VOD.   After hours of intense google second and third pages searching I gave up . And i contacted to the guy who made the soundboard app which includes the original ""potato aim"" audio file, sadly he doesnt have the VOD, or anything else related.  There is still hope for it but searching will be harder and probably it will take longer than 63 hour because it happened 1,5 year ago and it seems no one has a written or saved memo of it to anywhere.  At this point I gave up searching for it. All those reddit threads and peoples questions will be unanswered for a while, maybe forever."

Sony and Microsoft had policies that they will never allow AO games on consoles. To earn a M rating from the ESRB, most of the scenes depicting sex (one of which is interactive) and other adult content were removed from the North American versions.   So the version that is being selled on Steam is probably the rated M version."

When multiple people surrounded Lirik shorty would assist Lirik then leave. Its not like shorty actually stream sniped Lirik.

DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,Bossanac,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:34:11 2015 UTC,This wasnt even possible he hasent choosen any games at that time for sub sunday and we would wait for teh downloads
DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,tanhuynh226,-2,Sun Jul 5 16:05:08 2015 UTC,I thought Lirik was fat so it's not like he could go anywhere
DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,ALLAAFK,-4,Sun Jul 5 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"because sadly, majority of his viewers are 12y old retards with autism"

DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,l0st_t0y,6,Sun Jul 5 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Though I don't understand where the confusion came from in the first place. It's seemed pretty clear he meant a 24 hr stream today, continuing on from his normal stream"
DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,MegaGralha,3,Sun Jul 5 02:09:34 2015 UTC,Absolutely insane that he got over 1k subs in a single day. Twitch amazes me sometimes.

DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,l0st_t0y,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:01:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I do remember that. Its just kinda crazy that he can do that when he's playing a game that is fairly aged.
DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,MarcraM,2,Sun Jul 5 02:07:32 2015 UTC,Chat loves their 24 hour streams.
DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,0b4m4,4,Sun Jul 5 02:09:41 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the appeal to it. Very few if any people watch the whole thing. It was pretty cool when streaming was new I guess, but the idea has kinda died to me. I would rather him just do something different and cool with the stream although I don't know what that would be."
DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,MediocreCovers,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:14:23 2015 UTC,how much did he actually hit?
DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,Gramercy_Riffs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:28:26 2015 UTC,In my opinion he should do it next Friday for optimum viewership but it's his call.  I'm not going to be late to work and not be able to sleep afterwards so I'm not going to be watching all of it tomorrow.   Just my opinion tho hope everyone who doesn't have full time jobs has fun.
DatGuyLirik,3c5oju,MediocreCovers,0,Sun Jul 5 03:49:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hope it's a 24h sub sunday stream. What else is he gonna do for the next 12 hours?"

All the problems I had to deal with every day just flew away. I've been almost subbed since the very beginning with my account ""NotBlacer"" but had to switch to ""Blacerrr"" just 9 months ago. Just hit 25 months subbed yesterday technically. I still remember how it gave me chills just to watch his uncommentated BF3 gameplay back then.   Im so glad that he will revisit DayZ Mod.

DatGuyLirik,3buwh4,Dr-GimpfeN,0,Thu Jul 2 10:42:55 2015 UTC,clearly best perk of watching live
DatGuyLirik,3buwh4,Larryx123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:57:20 2015 UTC,I work during most of the beginning/a3l part of the stream and get home for night stream.  I usually just watch some of the previous days a3l on Thursday or something like that.  Or you know just watch or play something else.
DatGuyLirik,3buqy7,Short_Kings,9,Thu Jul 2 08:56:46 2015 UTC,I rather have a sub/donation alert blending in than an alert that interrupts the stream IMO. Maybe lirik should turn of the alert (I don't know how much work it takes to turn on/off) when he is doing an immersive playthrough or having a good rp session. So he can give a shoutout for the notifications he missed after the playthrough/session ends.  For the Darkest dungeon guy I think it is
DatGuyLirik,3buqy7,Holymormor,2,Thu Jul 2 14:21:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed.    The only interrupt I notice is Lirik stopping to let the sound play out then continuing his sentence.. which he's done for.. I don't know how long.  Personally love the sound and think it's very fitting to new subscribers, but if you check my comment history in this subreddit i'm a little biased :/"
DatGuyLirik,3buqy7,Orsenn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:42:10 2015 UTC,"See but that's the thing, because it blends in, it feel like you're hearing multiple people talking at the same time and sometimes you can't even understand anything being said, that is interrupting the stream.  The last one stands out in a way that is easy to filter therefore it was pretty damn rare the times were you couldn't understand something going on at the same time and to me that's not interrupting the stream.   I do see how the new sub sound might be better in single player games tho, but Lirik rarely plays those."
DatGuyLirik,3buqy7,oldage,2,Thu Jul 2 17:49:47 2015 UTC,it doesn't even have the spooky darkest dungeon filter :(

DatGuyLirik,3bemtp,sixpooler,-1,Sat Jul 4 19:46:40 2015 UTC,please get rid of bean bandit and lirikC. No one uses it anymore
DatGuyLirik,3bemtp,rcon__,21,Sun Jun 28 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"To those of us who have been watching Lirik for years, the Bean bandits still hold great meaning to us. If you don't share that history and those memories then that's unfortunate, but just because it means nothing to you, does not mean it is the same for everyone.  If nothing else the bean bandit emote serves as a reminder of humble beginnings. Please don't write it off so easily. Thanks.  Edited to add: I upvoted you anyway as people should not be downvoting you just because they disagree with your opinion. Downvotes are meant to be for abusive or off topic comments only, and your post was neither."

DatGuyLirik,3berhd,thecakeslayer,2,Sun Jun 28 20:48:16 2015 UTC,yeah and he doesnt understand that randomer thing with the roadblocks and stuff like maintenance
DatGuyLirik,3berhd,Dr-GimpfeN,2,Sun Jun 28 20:53:15 2015 UTC,The game looks like a smaller version of Anno. A larger focus on resource management and building placement/proximity more than anything else.
DatGuyLirik,3berhd,GJB_93,2,Sun Jun 28 21:02:55 2015 UTC,game look similar to pharaoh game that is like 15 years old
DatGuyLirik,3berhd,JrFryta,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:41:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what I thought. They could have modded that old game and change the textures as an easier way to develope this game."
DatGuyLirik,3berhd,sigserio,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:09:32 2015 UTC,the main game mechanic are the roadblocks to control the pathing of the randomer/wanderer. he doesnt understand that yet but i hope he will if he ever plays it again

DatGuyLirik,3bbgj3,lefiath,18,Sat Jun 27 16:55:09 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he said he wasn't gonna do a Single Saturday today because of all the Batman he has been playing this past week.
DatGuyLirik,3bbgj3,Mystbrai,12,Sat Jun 27 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly, he's been playing a single-player game all week. Single Saturday is designed to be a break from all the multiplayer games Lirik plays throughout the week, but when a single-player game comes out and he plays it all week, then he can postpone Single Saturday."
DatGuyLirik,3bbgj3,bDoDDleS,2,Sat Jun 27 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"One Saturday was due to personal events, and the other (today) is due to what everyone else has said - Batman all week.   If you'd listen to the stream he mentions what's happening with regards to any changes in the schedule at least half a dozen times - and rounds up at the end of the stream what's happening (easily playable on the vods if you don't care to watch the whole show) or if you don't care for that at all there's usually some sort of mention on twitter.  Sometimes changes like this happen - look at the amount of times sub sunday had to be rolled over because of events that clashed, just roll with the punches and go watch the Batman VODs for your single Saturday fix :)"
DatGuyLirik,3bbgj3,BecsFTW,2,Sat Jun 27 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"Relax....he only started singles saturday like what, 2-3 weeks ago? And the only reason hes not doing it this week is because he played a single player game literally all week"
DatGuyLirik,3bbgj3,atomsej,4,Sat Jun 27 21:16:19 2015 UTC,"Technically, he announced singles saturday over 2 years ago. Classic Lirik though, it took two years two start doing it."

DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,Milfguaardian,4,Sat Jun 27 07:19:05 2015 UTC,"Well so far it's the Witcher 3, I'm a 100 hours in, captivated like I haven't been in years, and only about half done with the game. Lirik has praised the Witcher 3 on stream many times,  but sadly I fear he is done with it. Other than that,  we need to see what the rest of the year brings, Fallout 4, Phantom Pain and a few others could be huge."
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,Tmp20,2,Sat Jun 27 08:01:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I've never played and invested that much time on to a single player game since skyrim. IMO witcher 3 just stomps skyrim in terms of content. And yeah this year isn't over yet, still a lot of games to lookout for but for now witcher 3 is my baby."
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,Yomanpepsican,2,Sat Jun 27 08:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah man I never liked skyrim but holy shit the witcher, my dream is a game like witcher 3 in another universe and setting with character customization and classes."
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,ingenious28,3,Sun Jun 28 23:33:54 2015 UTC,i'd rather see someone play a game that they're enjoying than sludge through a game that i personally enjoy but they hate.
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,Capn_C,2,Sat Jun 27 12:34:28 2015 UTC,I don't think he necessarily hates it though.
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,ingenious28,0,Sat Jun 27 14:16:03 2015 UTC,"True. I'd say he hates the lengthy dialogue, which occurs fairly frequently in that game."
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,Capn_C,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"Which seems odd considering how much he loved Witcher 2, which had a lot of dialogue as well."
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,Trutherbot0,2,Sat Jun 27 15:32:37 2015 UTC,"Lirik isn't patient enough, I was watching his vods of witcher 3 and you could tell that he was kind of ""speed running"" the game. He took no time on reading dialogues and ended up confused on what you are supposed to do in certain quests. He progressed so much of it, but what's the point then? Stopping after he has played for 20ish hours. It's like watching a movie half through and quit watching it. I just wished he gave it more of a chance."
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,Dofty,5,Sat Jun 27 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"Sadly that's just how lirik plays video games. He is very impatient and reading is hard, if he doesn't get instant gratification he loses interest."
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,Fonager,2,Sat Jun 27 23:38:33 2015 UTC,"So far The Witcher 3 is my GOTY, that will most likely change when Fallout 4 releases. Hell, it might as well be a tie."
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,CandyFTW,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:05:46 2015 UTC,"Fallout CAN still be dogshit you know. Also, I think for the majority TW3 is gonna be GOTY its just so rich in everyway. Fallout might be amazing but I realy doubt it can be as full, rich, beatiful as TW3."
DatGuyLirik,3ba9cy,Capn_C,0,Sun Jun 28 02:42:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed, never really got in the fallout series but personally I don't see myself liking fallout 4 than how much I enjoyed playing TW3(my first witcher game)."

DatGuyLirik,3azzep,baramgood,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"I don't get it, how does this affect you? I don't own Ark because I don't like Ark, and so the sub server will have nothing to do with me. The state of the game is irrelevant, if people want the sub server why shouldn't they get it?  Also, the server will ofc be whitelisted with only subs; I have never played in a sub only server, but I assume there would be little to no griefers. Let's be real, Lirik will probably play very little of Ark compared to his subs if this server goes online, and that's fine because it's meant to be FOR the subs."
DatGuyLirik,3azzep,Yomanpepsican,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:21:40 2015 UTC,why should subs not grief?
DatGuyLirik,3azzep,Dr-GimpfeN,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:24:47 2015 UTC,"They can do whatever they want, but killing players and their dinos as well as destroying the player's house while he or she is offline kinda does sound stupid as fuck. I am just assuming subs would probably treasure their server and community more so than randoms would in the other official and public servers."
DatGuyLirik,3azzep,Yomanpepsican,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:00:57 2015 UTC,Does the server still password based? I doubt that sub server could be better. Unless the server log has pretty nice systems and Admins monitoring the server 24/7.
DatGuyLirik,3azzep,Yomanpepsican,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:37:27 2015 UTC,What do you mean password based? You have to be whitelisted to get in.
DatGuyLirik,3azzep,happyleo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:51:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, sub servers have always been for the subs, not Lirik.   Entertainment quality of the stream would drop drastically in a sub server because too many people would act like total idiots when he's trying to Stream. It would be non stop Stream sniping, not necessarily everyone trying to kill him, but lots of subs would just follow him around, and some of them will be extremely obnoxious. This is why he typically tries to hide the names of the public servers he joins for games like this."
DatGuyLirik,3azzep,Vargurr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:59:01 2015 UTC,"He said he's gonna back to public server like he did in first time. I don't want him to get suffer every time he login. I'm hype for him to go back in ARK world, but I want him to stay in Moon server."
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,Hawaii_Beach,3,Wed Jun 24 09:18:11 2015 UTC,"First time he played CG was when A3L died for couple days (drama),  but he didn't like it too much and switched back.  I think deciding factor was Timmac asking him to try it out again and  this time it was a lot better and he decided to stay."
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,Larryx123,3,Wed Jun 24 14:15:07 2015 UTC,I think it is because of the server admins. The ones on A3L are just plain stupid.
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,Tikotjee,2,Wed Jun 24 11:36:30 2015 UTC,"Life Studios (The original A3L server) has had a ton of drama even since the early days of the mod. Lately, it has gotten way worse and people started to leave the server because of it. That's when people started to switch over to CG because the admins are better there and less drama.  Lirik doesn't care about what happens behind the scenes though, he just wants a full server. It's boring being on an empty server or with just people you know are from the stream in his game. That is why he switched over.. plus Sayeed convinced him a bit."
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,Jokez4Dayz,2,Fri Jun 26 04:21:45 2015 UTC,"Because there more people in CG, and there the casino and a lot of new stuff compare to the regual a3l."
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,Cumpilation,0,Wed Jun 24 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"Well, it was because Sayeed and Lo migrated I think - they were the people he played against the most often. He probably just went there to check it out, since Sayeed recommended it to him. He's said he's considered playing on both servers but I don't think he's bothered to install both servers (it's tricky to switch back and forth) and he might not get as good RP there anymore."
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,anarkandi,2,Wed Jun 24 12:52:14 2015 UTC,"Actually its pretty easy, just make 2 folders and switch files back depend what u wanna play, takes 30 sec."
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,Larryx123,4,Wed Jun 24 14:09:59 2015 UTC,"sayeed and lo chang are the ones following lirik around, i highly doubt lirik would switch just because these 2 streamstalkers switched"
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,byKonzii,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:43:20 2015 UTC,"Afaik Assassino (Lo Chang) and Milosh never sniped him, can't tell about others tho. Surely many of them do to get that e-fame. But yeah, Lirik definetly wouldn't switch cuz others did. Stream comes first and CG is more fun right now, so that's why he switched IMO."
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,Larryx123,0,Wed Jun 24 14:20:21 2015 UTC,.. Ok and why did Sayeed and Lo Chang switch to criticalgaming?
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,Pedarsen,5,Wed Jun 24 13:05:04 2015 UTC,I think Lo Chang switched after Lirik and Sayeed went over but Sayeed played on Critical looong before Lirik did.  Lirik went over after Sayeed told him it was better. Don't know if thats the only reason but it's at least one of them. The biggest reason is probably that he wanted something new and on Critical there is more to do.  Sayeed went over when he was banned on A3L. Thats what most people in the start of Critical did. They were fed up with the admins on A3L so they went to Critical.
DatGuyLirik,3axn6l,assassinozockt,2,Wed Jun 24 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"I was planning on going to CG for a long while but I never did it because all people I play with were on A3L at that time. Then Sayeed, Brian and the entirety of the Suits switched to CG and I went with them."

DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Euradys,85,Mon Jun 22 16:56:02 2015 UTC,"He's been getting a lot worse. He goes on rants for 15 minutes now and spends a decent portion of his streaming time being negative about other things (this game sucks, this movie sucks, chat sucks, that player sucks, not a single positive comment in an hour) in a bitter, whiny, angry voice. The first hour of his stream is usually the worst.  He needs a vacation and a new perspective on how to interact with chat: he's way too emotionally invested in the smallest critiques or negative comments / trolls right now. Should call up day[9] and get some help."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,gg4444,15,Mon Jun 22 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i want Happy Lirik back too ("
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,domoreyoga,12,Mon Jun 22 20:24:32 2015 UTC,"He also give up on games to fast, he says we gonna play more of this tommorow then he regrets. Then he sits in a hour in intermission. He basically loved Basement and probably won't go back to it. Then he complains no good games. He also liked night stream games like WWE that he was going to play with waffle & shortyy and never happens.  He loves ""ark"" he said but then he dosn't play it because other people is higher lvl. That dosn't make sense. The point is to survive and build a house to go through the survival. Frankie, Sada strated at begging and its amazing to see how much they grew in such a little time.  He does need vacation yeah thats true but he complains on many gumes but he dosn't realize he has over 100 games that he loved on sub sunday."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Rustic77,27,Mon Jun 22 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"I see those as separate issues. I honestly don't care at all about him giving up on new games fast, but the negativity just kills his stream for me.   His stream, at it's core, is about his personality - he's not a pro at any of the games he plays. It's an ""experience"" stream as opposed to a high-level ""pro"" stream. And when his personality goes from funny, witty and upbeat with moments of rage to just bitterness, whining and negativity with moments of being upbeat, I mute him or turn it off."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,gg4444,17,Mon Jun 22 20:21:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. Lirik used to be my go to streamer, his streams were very entertaining. Then it seemed that they were becoming tedious for him and I really started to notice an increase in negativity. I can still see the appeal, but personally I have tendencies to dwell on negative thoughts myself, and I'd rather not spend my free time watching someone else give off that negative energy too. In fact I'd rather watch the complete opposite, someone interesting who genuinely seems like they're having fun and enjoys engaging with games/chat, and it seems Lirik can't really offer that these days.    So I started watching various other streamers and I haven't looked back. I just watch occasionally when he's playing a game that I really enjoy, like Fallout 3.   I think he needs a break or something. There's some degree of irony in that this thread is a pretty negative critique of Lirik - I hope he doesn't read it just like he shouldn't read the trolls in chat. He's definitely most entertaining when he's just doing himself and ignoring all negative comments, but I imagine it's easier said than done and it's hard not to let them take a toll."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,MysteriousTony,2,Mon Jun 22 21:22:30 2015 UTC,So I started watching various other streamers and I haven't looked back   What have you found?
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,gg4444,5,Mon Jun 22 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"Well nothing extraordinary or 'underground', these are just the streamers that i'm enjoying watching but i'm sure many will find them insufferable: my man Spamfish, FuturemanGaming, Bikeman, ManVsGame. I'll always watch Geers if he's streaming. And then a couple of Diablo 3 streamers who are always entertaining and engaging - Quin69 and DatModz. Too many!  Oh and DansGaming of course."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,MysteriousTony,4,Mon Jun 22 22:30:41 2015 UTC,"This is kind of niche, but I've started watching a guy named GameJ06 (that's a zero, not an ""O"") who streams speedruns of Mario Lost Levels along with other older games. This guy's attitude is just overall cheerful all the time and he's family friendly without being too sensitive or nerdy or... I don't know how to say it. It's a great change of pace and it's pretty impressive when he does some of the stuff he does on Lost Levels."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,PeefHats,2,Mon Jun 22 23:49:59 2015 UTC,"He did a speedrun at AGDQ 2015 and gained a lot of popularity from it. Very nice, upbeat streamer.   Would you like an eggroll?"
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Blowsight,4,Tue Jun 23 14:59:40 2015 UTC,I think he's got slight depression for some reason and I remember when even just a few months ago he was so cheery all the time. It really sucks seeing him all bitter now.
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,IMadeThisforMineZ,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:06:43 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, but yes negativity is bad.  Lirik is generally not afraid to show affection, a humble side, which we all know is part of who he is.  It's also what makes his sarcasm a little funnier, because it's a stark contrast to how sentimental he can be.  The one day a guy in H1Z1 said, ""jesus was a non-sub"" was funny.  It was cute, and all well in good fun.    Long complaint fueled rants though are distracting, not happy, and I do turn off the stream myself.  Lirik makes me feel good when he's having a good day, and makes me laugh.  That's the one I will watch, not the one that's bitter.    Who knows?  It may be from pressure, not enough vacation, or maybe not enough time with actual friends outside computer life.  The strain has been showing a lot more over the last year.  My wife and I have talked about it some and pondered how difficult success can be.  He does learn from his mistakes, and I can see him turning things around."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Roez,6,Tue Jun 23 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, he's just so lazy that it actually effects him playing games. Even in games he is so lazy such as fallout 3 or other games that actually require some effort to play, read, pay attention for a minute. Then he says that something sucks because it's boring but in reality he didn't play it right so his opinion is negative."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Vaultwanderer111,-1,Tue Jun 23 01:36:55 2015 UTC,"Lirik has always been a bit ADD with games (and pretty impatient).  That's part of his success and why his personality is attractive.  It keeps the content fresh and interesting.    He's one of the few streamers who play tons of different games and has success, and things like this are the reason."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Roez,-1,Tue Jun 23 16:32:50 2015 UTC,"really? doesn't seem that bad to me. lirik just says what he thinks, that's why he is lirik. you have also realise that chat is getting worse lately with sub Sundays and Saturdays.  But yeah, have to agree that less he concentrates on negative the better"
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Marmidon,2,Tue Jun 23 05:07:05 2015 UTC,"Yes saying what he thinks has always been a good thing about the stream however. Back in the days of around 2+ years ago it was almost always about the game he was playing or responding to the talk in chat, hardly ever over the top negative stuff. Now a lot of the stuff he says or comments on is bitter stuff.  As said previously it irks me because back in that time frame Lirik was really entertaining to watch and engage with and was the reason I subbed and donated to him. Now though it's just not the same.   Like you, I believe that this could be solved by just focusing as little on the negativity in chat and other places."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Jovatic,28,Tue Jun 23 18:05:35 2015 UTC,yes
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,philphilphil,17,Mon Jun 22 16:59:53 2015 UTC,"I have definitely found myself frequenting other streams lately, for this reason. I understand that it is probably hard to ignore the negative comments with a following as large as Lirik's, but it seems that when a streamer is nicer to their chat, the chat is nicer to them in return.   Why would you want to watch someone when all they do is complain, insult chat, and act like they hate every game? I watch streamers like GoldGlove, Waffle, and DansGaming because they always seem like they are excited about the games they are playing and they are just nice people even when there are some idiots in chat.   Unfortunately, I think he may start to see a drop in numbers if things don't change and the only people left in chat will be the ones who caused this toxicity in the first place. It's too bad that people just can't be nice to one another. That goes for chat AND for the streamer."

DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Kiiilerke,4,Tue Jun 23 08:25:46 2015 UTC,"This kind of negativity is usually the worst during H1Z1, where it's clear to see that he doesn't enjoy the gameplay and is looking for distractions. When he actually enjoys a game, it's quite rare to see him focus on such irrelevant stuff."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Jtaneli,16,Tue Jun 23 14:14:33 2015 UTC,I think he/his mods needs to strike down on them a bit harder with the ban hammer. Hopefully put things in a good state again.   He gets all pissed and it ruins my immersion. :'(
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Kopelin,4,Mon Jun 22 17:21:18 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this since SubSunday started to get out of control. I don't want to see Lirik annoyed, I just want to see him kick back and have some fun playing games.  I don't really think it's as big of a deal as some people make it out to be, but again, I just want to see him and chat having a good time."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Limelol,-3,Mon Jun 22 17:34:36 2015 UTC,He already bans people who comments a sarcastic/satire statement that most of have a Kappa at the end.
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,WallusTheWalrus,9,Mon Jun 22 18:52:00 2015 UTC,It saddens me how angry he becomes just by reading some comments
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Swerry,7,Mon Jun 22 21:38:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have to agree here, don't wanna be a person that flames, but really got me thinking especially yesterday when he went on a long rant. It doesn't have to be like this. :("
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,DatUrsidae,6,Tue Jun 23 12:10:38 2015 UTC,I love liriks adorable chat. I personally use sub sundays to update my block list with the new adorable people who have subbed throughout the week.
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,P1XEL,3,Mon Jun 22 23:56:06 2015 UTC,i think its because hes getting bored of playing the same games over and over  i guess he's waiting for that next big shooter to come out
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,uoftsucks,6,Tue Jun 23 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely but it won't change, I think at this point Lirik goes out of his way to find the stupid comments and enjoys to rant off cause it entertains the stream or at least a good some of them. The more people that watch the more stupid that comes, nothing we can do about that but ignore what we don't like or leave."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,outla5t,6,Mon Jun 22 18:00:11 2015 UTC,He is not going to change and it's surely not happening soon.
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,VickFVM,6,Mon Jun 22 23:02:00 2015 UTC,If he keeps answering to hate he will only encourage it more. No one will send positive messages of they feel they won't be read and haters only keep sending messages because it gets attention from both broadcaster and viewers
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,rfdinis,4,Mon Jun 22 20:28:49 2015 UTC,blame the subs
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Santusak,3,Tue Jun 23 09:20:51 2015 UTC,"The thing about our bean bandit community is that they all jump on one persons dick. If someone says a negative comment they tend not to be the one to keep it quiet, they spam the shit in to chat and other people tend to jump on their band wagon. This is why the occasions throwaway account is made to talk shit about something and it just blows things way out of proportion. We need to ignore it to help Lirik ignore it."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Portrend,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:08:04 2015 UTC,"Kinda feel like he shouldn't read chat except maybe a private chat channel with people he feels comfortable with.  That and no donation messages, those are so fucking cringe it is ridiculous.  But yeah, I feel bad for him, I mean sure he makes good money playing games, but it really seems like the retards/clingy kids who need hugs from their parents are getting to him."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,bonedead,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:41:38 2015 UTC,"To add my two cents, Lirik has clearly stated many times in his stream that if something is stupid, or a game sucks whether or not the dev is watching he will voice his opinion. He has always done this in his stream, one of the biggest reasons people watch him play new games is for his honest review of a game. He is looked at as a trust worthy source in a time where devs pay to have positive reviews.   As for him being negative towards other people, you need to understand half the shit most people say in twitch chat is RAW stupidity. So when he  on someone hes letting that person know ""Hey, you're being stupid. Please grow up"". Some of you that are streamers, you will understand. Those who are not, you wont.   He may give up on games too fast but you have to understand at least he is playing multiple games. On a site where 90% of the broadcasters play 1 game and only that 1 game. Of course if you don't like how Lirik broadcasts you could always not watch him.  But that is too easy right...."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,KostonV,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:17:10 2015 UTC,"it's only natural to notice the bad comments in chat over good ones. but yeah it does go on for awhile when he rants but i more hate the chats about ""making it as a streamer""  that is boring ._. and happens to much lately."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,stjunk,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not even a sub but i agree, this happens way too much, P.S. I had to use the stream as a vent outlet one day and it was the best time I ever had. Great community, great streamer."
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Brite_Lite,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:23:22 2015 UTC,"I think the sub mode should be disabled and a huge slowmode enabled instead. Or just a sub mode + huge slowmode.

Its really on the rest of us as a community to discourage this behavior and as a group show those making these kind of comments they aren't welcome.
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Mucx,-5,Tue Jun 23 03:32:23 2015 UTC,We should offer Lirik three weeks of vacations. Can we force him to take some time off?
DatGuyLirik,3aq88j,Daflesh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:27:36 2015 UTC,3 weeks? I think it should be 1 week max to like a Con or event. 3 weeks off would probably be bad for his channel more than good for him.

DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,darkayk,25,Mon Jun 22 18:00:04 2015 UTC,"I think OP was also referring to Lirik himself. He said something along like ""when people create their own chat to talk about you, you know you've made it as a broadcaster"", almost belittling us like it was made to talk negatively about him, which is not the case at all.  It was really sad to see the subs who spammed ""HEY NONSUBS lirikPOOP"" and the like in the non-sub chat for a good 20-30 minutes though. It's a vocal minority and the non-sub chat is in no way Lirik's responsibility, I get that,  but Lirik adding fuel to the flames doesn't help. You have to be acceptant of non-subs if you want to create a friendly community, or else these things start to happen more and more."
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,NoIMBrian,11,Mon Jun 22 20:00:08 2015 UTC,"I've followed Lirik for 2.5 years and I most of the time arrive 5-10 minutes early just to chat before the chat goes crazy.  I'm not a sub, and I've never really taken anything Lirik says about non-subs to heart or serious. Just thought about it as a joke. But if he really belittles us just for not giving him money, that would be pathetic. Since I've probably spent more time in his channel than the majority of the subs have. The non-subs is what keeps him at the top of twitch if you think about it, so I can't see Lirik actually being serious when he talks about non-subs."
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,imsparkly,3,Mon Jun 22 21:36:37 2015 UTC,Or at least have one day in the week with subscriber mode off the whole day. I guess it would not damage his stream if he would give the non subs one day in a week.
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,extivity,3,Mon Jun 22 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't fix anything though. There are too many people trying to talk in chat at the same time, making normal conversations impossible. Adding non subs to that mix would just make it worse. The separate Non sub chat fixes that problem by just having less people in it."
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,kroom_,10,Tue Jun 23 07:22:22 2015 UTC,"Non-subs make up 2/3 of his viewer number. I can't understand how he can hate on them.    Btw the non-sub chat is a lot better than the sub chat. Sub chat is basically just emotespam, X LirikH, and people trying every way not to get banned while voicing their opinion."
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,meandyouandyouandme,25,Tue Jun 23 16:22:02 2015 UTC,Without the nonsubs lirik would be nothing. Shame on him for belittling them. He should know better.
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,Vaultwanderer111,26,Tue Jun 23 01:39:04 2015 UTC,Probably just salty that it's actually more civil then sub chat.
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,IMadeThisforMineZ,8,Mon Jun 22 21:03:36 2015 UTC,"I would like an explanation as to why in the fuck is making a separate non-sub chat ""sad and weird"" in his opinion... What He said was just straight up stupid."
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,dszklarz,12,Wed Jun 24 15:23:42 2015 UTC,"I felt very insulted by Liriks comments about nonsubs and nonsubchat. Normally I am very tolerant when it comes to stuff like that. It sounded very greedy and arrogant. Why shouldnt the nonsubs have their own chatroom? I mean he alway stream with subonly chat. Which is also totally ok, because even the subonly chat is crowded. You cant subscribe to every channel you watch. Nonsubs also include people who were subs for like 6 or more/less months who arent subbed anymore. Its the basis of his streams. You cant just insult them only because they arent paying viewers. This time he was serious and not just joking about nonsubs. Regarding the other thread about Lirik focusing on negative things I have no real reason to come back and watch something like batman. Why not just e.g. watch ManvsGame playing while he is having FUN? Other Streamers are focusing much more on building a nice community and having a great time streaming. Another aspect are the subs he is getting by doing subsunday sellout things. Like naming something after subs. i dont think that its the best idea to reach out to such people."
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,RulOrphant,17,Tue Jun 23 10:16:20 2015 UTC,I actually think the idea of nonsub chat is pretty cool. Even the chat itself is pretty civil most of the time.
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,Limelol,5,Mon Jun 22 17:54:26 2015 UTC,Yeah some of us even listens to music together sometimes at https://plug.dj/lirik-non-subs  I havent had time the past week but it used to be pretty active.
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,xZneak,17,Tue Jun 23 17:41:11 2015 UTC,"It comes down to money. Lirik knows there's less incentive to pay for subbing if there's a non-sub chat where people can talk, instead of paying to ""talk"" in his official chat. So he naturally tries to shut it down, because I don't really see how having a second, unofficial chat is ""sad"" and ""weird"".   I would be honored that people like me that much and care about me that they wanted to create an active place where they can talk and comment about the stream because they're unable to do so in the regular channel."
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,bacje16,5,Tue Jun 23 07:25:14 2015 UTC,"i agree with most of you here, like when he gets 30-40k viewers and we know only he only has around 10k subs you shit on the non-subs? he wouldn't be on top of twitch without them"
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,Giony1,16,Wed Jun 24 01:28:24 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a douche bag thing to say on Lirik's part, maybe he didn't understand the donation but he talks shit about his chat all the time so maybe me meant it.   I've never been to the non sub chat so don't know about porn links and stuff, but the sub chat at the time were pretty defensive of the non sub chat saying it was cool and were asking Lirik why it was weird so...."

Just disable chat and see how amazing lirik's stream is! Sorry, me no englando!"
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,TomekCalavera,0,Tue Jun 23 07:15:52 2015 UTC,"I remember when I first came to the stream and he chatted with non-subs, even I got noticed and it made me happy. Obviously it's a whole different situation comparing around 10,000 views average to 20,000 - 30,000 viewers average which pretty much forces a sub-chat and drives both chats to their own community, hence there is a Non-sub chat group created that's very cool (but spammy).  I can't read when people are serious with sarcasm or just insults, but non-subs are human too. :)"
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,DatUrsidae,7,Tue Jun 23 12:06:23 2015 UTC,"Non-sub chat is the opposite of ""spammy"", unless you count whole sentences or even ""essays"" as ""spammy"", instead of 1 liner emoticon spam in sub-chat."

DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,DatGuyPassa,5,Mon Jun 22 22:35:21 2015 UTC,"It's a democratic channel, you can choose to ignore the spammers - who more often than not are subs. With enough reports, they'll be IP banned. There isn't always a mod online to deal with it."

DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,Ultimate_Me,-17,Tue Jun 23 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"For subs it ruins the value of their sub package if non-subs can have a cool chat to hang out in. For Lirik, it makes it harder to monetize his stream (via getting subs) if non-subs have their own chat place too."
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,gg4444,4,Mon Jun 22 18:37:33 2015 UTC,A) The thing that ruins the value of the sub package is the dire state that subchat is in.  B) Lirik has no bearing on whether non-subs want a place to chat and this will never change. If they want to sub they will sub.  This is as an almost 2 year subscriber.
DatGuyLirik,3aqd90,Jovatic,-10,Wed Jun 24 00:11:30 2015 UTC,Because subs love the feeling of being special. Probably because non subs often post bullshit because they dont fear the ban. But i guess its a mix of more problems

DatGuyLirik,3as5bu,Edentrail,-2,Tue Jun 23 10:39:22 2015 UTC,"Because Fallout 4 release was/is the biggest hype right now ever. I don't even hear about Witcher 3 that much anymore.  You gotta realise it's all about the hype. He played Evolve during beta it was fun as fuck, but full-release and no one cared.  I know Witcher 3 is probably one of the best games released in a while and it is pretty impressive even though I didn't really make time to play it myself. Point being it's much less interesting than when everyone aren't talking about it. Skyrim really being the last game that gave me long-lasting ""hype"" since the release."
DatGuyLirik,3as5bu,ajaxwow,7,Tue Jun 23 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"People still regularly talk about Witcher 3 and give it praise, like on /r/gaming. It's brought up all the time as a likely GOTY contender.  Fact is, is that the Fallout and Elder Scrolls franchises have larger and more vocal fanbases than those for the Witcher series, and FO4 had the added benefit of being highly anticipated for years. It didn't help that it was announced only a few weeks after W3's release. Skyrim probably wouldn't have had as much long-lasting hype if something like HL3 or anything else else that is equally anticipated by many fans was announced soon after the rpg's release."
DatGuyLirik,3as5bu,Capn_C,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:25:21 2015 UTC,I was really just saying that this is Lirik we are talking about. He gets excited about the games every other streamer does. It's understandable.

And, to be honest, they are not only fun to watch, but lirik has a fun time playing them as he would not usually play these games. If you do not like the game(s) he is playing NOTHING is forcing you to watch."

DatGuyLirik,3ahups,flamuchz,13,Sat Jun 20 12:14:39 2015 UTC,that's a perfect explanation of how how the non-sub jokes has now turned into elitism & hate towards anyone who is NOT subbed to Lirik
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,outla5t,52,Sun Jun 21 08:34:56 2015 UTC,Isn't 'a joke' supposed to be funny? As a sub I'm getting a bit tired of the non-sub bashing. These days more and more people don't sub with the reason to support Lirik anymore. They just think they are more 'elite' when they do and this is reflected in chat. They want shoutouts and start crying when they don't get one. They think they can choose the games Lirik plays just because they sub to him.
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,koen092,25,Sat Jun 20 10:20:00 2015 UTC,"They think they can choose the games Lirik plays just because they sub to him.   Well... Technically they can, on Sundays!"
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,redditor401,-8,Sat Jun 20 12:16:34 2015 UTC,"For an hour which is no way experience most games, singles saturday is faaar more enjoyable. I voted for Fallout: NV 8 weeks in a row, and it was never chosen. It eventually was though, but Lirik barely made it out of Goodsprings before the hour was over. An hour is not enough time to really sink your teeth into a game."
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,TehJellyfish,-2,Sat Jun 20 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"The only reason non-subs don't do all of these things you listed is because it's in sub-only chat. Not to mention, a majority of the donations for game changes are probably non-subs."
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,dubslove,2,Mon Jun 22 15:24:38 2015 UTC,Saying those donations are 'probably non-subs' proves my point. It's the same with streamsnipers. Chat blames the non-subs for streamsniping but how can you even know who they are. I think there are probably quite some subs that think they're 'allowed' to streamsnipe because they are subbed.
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,koen092,-1,Mon Jun 22 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"How does that prove your point?   ""I think there are probably quite some subs that think they're allowed to streamsnipe"". lol nobody thinks they're allowed to streamsnipe."
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,dubslove,2,Mon Jun 22 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"You said that the donations are probably from non-subs. It shows how a sub like you (you are a sub if I'm correct?) assumes that non-subs are the ones that do wrong. And about the streamsnipers. There have been several occasions where Lirik shoots someone in a game like DayZ and they yell something like: 'don't shoot, I'm a sub'."
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,koen092,2,Mon Jun 22 21:36:41 2015 UTC,I'm not a sub.   Them saying that doesn't mean they actually believe it. Why would anyone who watches Lirik think he would not kill them? It's just them trying to be funny.   Both subs and non-subs do wrong... I'm not sure what your point is exactly.
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,dubslove,3,Mon Jun 22 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"My point was that some subs think they're holy just because they pay $5.- a month and that I'm getting tired of the non-sub bashing. I agree with your main point though, both non-subs and subs do wrong, but you'd expect more from people who pay money to supposedly support someone."
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,koen092,3,Mon Jun 22 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"Lirik usually jokes about how non subs are plebs and I think it's funny but some subs take it seriously and do feel that non subs actually are plebs. Many subs think they are far superior than non subs [like the Nazis did to the Jews]. I've seen subs disrespect non subs while Lirik is offline using comebacks such as: stfu nonsub or talk to me when ur a sub. I've been around since the days of wee woo and still haven't sub (even though I wish I could) and there's people that have been watching for a week and subbed and still think they're better just because they have an adorable crying cat next to their name. I have respect for most subs and mods especially, but there'll always be bitches since there's an abundant number of subs. Then again, shit like that shouldn't be taken seriously since it's the internet where there's always assholes so I'm pretty much a butthurt hypocrite. Plus, Lirik's chat is probably 10 times better than most chats like Sodapoppin's."
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,tanhuynh226,2,Sun Jun 21 19:54:11 2015 UTC,"yeah, but at least sodapoppin engages with subs and non-subs alike. He and many other streamers don't treat us like shit."

DatGuyLirik,3ahups,Gogkti,8,Sat Jun 20 09:13:28 2015 UTC,"I wonder though, if I were streaming, can me and my chat spew racist shit all day but add ""it's just a running joke"" at the end of the day and everything will be a-ok?  I don't really care what subs and lirik say and I'm not offended by it btw, just some food for thought."

DatGuyLirik,3ahups,Arkwoman1990,-3,Mon Jun 22 15:43:23 2015 UTC,Comparing racism and non-sub bashing.... lol.
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,dubslove,3,Mon Jun 22 15:25:36 2015 UTC,"Completely missing the point and focusing on the most obvious thing. No shit one's worse than the other, what's important is the point.   But seeing that it's difficult for you to comprehend, I've come up with another example:  Lirik is the captain of the football team, subs are his ass licking buddies and nonsubs are the not-so-popular kids who get bullied by the football team.  If they say ""We're just messing around"" after bullying someone, does that make it ok?"
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,bacje16,-1,Mon Jun 22 16:12:06 2015 UTC,"Again, you're comparing apples and oranges. You can't compare such extremes.   but seeing that it's difficult for you to comprehend, let me break it down for you.   Bullying is personally attacking someone mentally or physically. Saying ""fuck non-subs"" is not hurting anyone. If you're actually saying that non subs are being bullied is the most retarded shit. By that logic we should never ever think about offending anyone. You must hate comedians that make slightly offensive jokes. You must have been the whistle blower on fatpeoplehate.   Honestly, if you get offended by the non-sub jokes, you're too young / immature to be watching Lirik anyways. (Since you seem a little dumb, I'm not talking about you specifically when I say if you're offended by non sub jokes)."
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,dubslove,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:55:05 2015 UTC,"Talk to me being ""a little dumb"" when you learn to read kiddo, my first post in the tree which you replied to:  ""I don't really care what subs and lirik say and I'm not offended by it btw, just some food for thought.""  I won't be offended by it, because I'm an adult. There are however kids and insecure teens that watch him too and they can take that shit personally. You argue that online bullying isn't a thing apparently and I can show you quite a few cases that ended tragically because people thought it was just fun and jokes while on the other side on the stick was a person with some serious emotional issues. And that doesn't strictly apply to him shitting on nonsubs either, he's singling out people regularly too and subs all hurry to jump on the shit-bandwagon.  It's time to jump down from your high horse, oh white knight, because lord lorik wont give you her maidenhead."
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,bacje16,0,Mon Jun 22 18:17:20 2015 UTC,"""you claim online bullying isn't a thing"". When did I ever say that?   saying ""fuck non-subs"" isn't a personal attack lol. You're now comparing this to online cyber bullying? are you for real? You clearly don't know what cyber bullying is if you think this is it....  He's singling out people for acting retarded.   That last line... r/cringe"
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,dubslove,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:19:56 2015 UTC,"Bullying is not necessarily a personal attack and ""fuck non subs"" is not the extent of it, you and I both know that, you're just playing dumb.  And no, he's singling out people for having a different opinion than him.  I don't care for arguing with fanboys so here my correspondence with you stops."
DatGuyLirik,3ahups,bacje16,5,Mon Jun 22 18:25:22 2015 UTC,"Its pretty much a running-gag on entire twitch, atlest on the channels i watch. Non-subs are often reffered as ""peasants"" or ""plebs"" or something similar like that. Subscribing to a channel doesn't really make you inferior, its just a way to support the broadcaster you like.

DatGuyLirik,3aiqo1,LifeBringsDeath,-14,Mon Jun 22 06:35:46 2015 UTC,I hoped he will play it today since last singles saturday voting was rig'd
DatGuyLirik,3aiqo1,atomsej,8,Sat Jun 20 17:09:05 2015 UTC,he mentioned he was going to be playing fallout on saturday throughout the whole week...
DatGuyLirik,3aiqo1,S14N,3,Sat Jun 20 17:33:48 2015 UTC,I thought there was no voting on Single Saturday.
DatGuyLirik,3aiqo1,BecsFTW,-6,Sat Jun 20 17:28:24 2015 UTC,"There was a poll last time, Black Mesa x Mafia 2"
DatGuyLirik,3aiqo1,SnuggleMonster15,7,Sat Jun 20 17:30:20 2015 UTC,That only happened last time because he was going to play Mafia 2 but had been craving Black Mesa so got chat to vote (which ended in pretty much 50/50). Lirik has said quite a few times that single saturday will be him choosing the games :)

DatGuyLirik,3ah1d3,kalamies0,11,Sat Jun 20 02:42:39 2015 UTC,He simply doesn't want to play them on stream. Lately he has said that he finds them boring now but he used to play league and such. He says that most of his viewers would find them boring due to the games he has built his community out of (which is true).
DatGuyLirik,3ah1d3,CataChaos1320,5,Sat Jun 20 04:53:32 2015 UTC,"I know lirik used to play league, and I'm sure he watches the international every year, but im sure he doesnt play them anymore let alone on stream. Nothing against it im sure, just no interest."
DatGuyLirik,3ah1d3,Blahcookies,4,Sat Jun 20 06:10:33 2015 UTC,"He likes DotA and DotA2 a lot, he plays them off-stream sometimes, he played some other mobas aswell afaik (probably league is his second best choice), yet he doesn't want to stream them coz they're not related to his stream's theme + he doesn't like moba communities and moba fans (+ some other reasons like these).  Edit: Also besides the mobas, he likes the custom WC3 maps so he appreciated the DotA2's Reborn update. (Tweet is not that related with custom WC3 maps, I just wanted to throw it in there but he talked about the custom maps on stream.)"
DatGuyLirik,3ah1d3,forHonorDotA,4,Sat Jun 20 08:29:02 2015 UTC,"He used to play them a decent amount. Now he occasionally plays off stream when there is a big update. It seems he does like them, but he will never stream them."
DatGuyLirik,3ah1d3,Rasfada,3,Sat Jun 20 07:05:16 2015 UTC,"I think he doesn't hate them, but is more bored with them, because he used to play them and now he does not."

DatGuyLirik,3aah5m,FusselP0wner,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:30:29 2015 UTC,I'm not positive but I'd bet that twitch implements ads for all streams on mobile. Doubt Lirik can turn them on or off.

DatGuyLirik,3aah5m,Mucx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:56:27 2015 UTC,Lirik is indeed part of the old system whereby subbing = completely ad free.

Also hopefully, lirik will try to make a character with low intelligence levels, so check this video if you don't know what happens when you give little amount of points to intelligence.  Also if you are looking for a good disturbing book, check ""I have no mouth and I must scream"", iirc Vault 11's story is kinda related to this book.  Edit: Changed Vault 22 to 11."

I'm assuming he will finish the game too because he will probably only do the main story quests (which kinda sucks because of how much he will miss out on).

DatGuyLirik,3a2pkb,Mojacks_,2,Tue Jun 16 20:46:58 2015 UTC,"TBH, I'm 29 and a huge Nintendo fanboy.  I have almost 2 dozen pieces of Nintendo art hanging in my house. Right now I don't own a single console system.  Nintendo's press conference was extremely embarrassing.  Star Fox: Zero looked like it was being played on a Nintendo 64.  My eyes were bleeding watching that whole mess of a conference.   Most games today don't appeal to me.  Single player games are so dam easy now that its just not worth the effort to play them.  I only find enjoyment in Multiplayer games.  I'm even having a hard time finding time to play The Witcher and GTA 5, and those are amazing single player games.  Honestly I dont know if its just me or what but pretty much the last 7 years gameing has been taking a huge noise dive.  Everyone Copycats any games success. Which in turn makes a shitton of bad games.  Examples: Everquest was successful back in its day.  World of Warcraft took the good out of that game and built a solid platform and became something hughly successful.  After that EVERY. SINGLE. MMORPG. was a WoW clone and fuck me they were all so fucking bad.  Just like how LoL is insanely successful MoBA with the Free to play aspect.  Now everyone is including F2P models.  Then games like Minecraft and Dayz came out both different games but the princpals behind them are basicly the same.  Open world/sandbox (that word is fucking a joke now) no rules, no quest, no Objectives, no fucking nothing just play the game and have fun.  Now every mother fucker making games is trying to cash in on that survival/open world/sandbox bullshit and its leading to more and more shit games.  And don't even get me started on early access.

DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,forHonorDotA,19,Tue Jun 16 07:17:51 2015 UTC,"I think this is the first time I've ever wished the lirikTRASH emote wasn't a thing. I guess it's just the way it is, but reading chat today wasn't really any different from reading the actual E3's chat.   Maybe I'm just being hypersensitive, but it does get old seeing residentsleeper and the trash emote spammed. It's like the haters on sub sunday spamming next game. It's just so frequent, useless and annoying."
DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,Milkz,12,Tue Jun 16 08:22:15 2015 UTC,What started as a harmless emote has evolved into one of the most obnoxious things about chat.
DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,0b4m4,2,Tue Jun 16 13:52:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's weird but just a thing like the trash emote fuels negativity and aggression. It's so easy for people to just spam the emote. I think that's what I dislike the most with twitch chat in general. Lirik's chat and community has a huge potential to be something great, because in all honesty it's already pretty good. Maybe it's time to go slow mode when it's 30k+ people?"
DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,airikewr,2,Tue Jun 16 12:42:57 2015 UTC,"Is there an option to have slow mode affect subs? I think if the chat is sub only, then you can't use slowmode, unless there is some way to change that. Even so, that still means 1k of the 30k people can still spam the trash emote. Slow mode won't fully solve that problem."
DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,TylerConlin,2,Tue Jun 16 13:36:26 2015 UTC,What pisses me of the most is when I see all the mods in chat just chilling instead of timing out all the toxic idiots

DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,Capn_C,7,Tue Jun 16 19:18:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the only way I think the stream could currently be ""improved"" is for Lirik to be more deliberate in addressing his critics. I realize that that's just part of his personality and some people take what he says a little too seriously, but using terms like ""adorable"" has been a pretty good step towards improvement imo.   Also as for the community I dislike how black and white some people make it when it comes to enjoying the stream. Either you're a perfectly ideal fan who loves everything about the stream or you're an annnoying complainer who loves to whine all day and be toxic. It's like you can't be in between, loving the broadcast while still pointing out some potential improvements. Unfortunately the voices of those who get overly offended over everything done on the stream drown out those who might actually have positive well constructed criticisms. The moment you point out anything even remotely negative, even with the intention of providing constructive criticism, is often the moment when you're labeled by both fellow fans and mods as a pathetic whiner that doesn't deserve to still be a part of this community, and honestly that's a little sad."
DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,DzejBee,30,Tue Jun 16 13:55:43 2015 UTC,"MFW this and the other threads  But seriously. One thing I noticed lately is, that I think people just take stuff that Lirik says way too seriously. Doesn't matter if it's a ""review"" of a product or an insult to chat.   There's definitely a lot of fanboism and white knighting going around lately, when people just blindly follow what he says, even tho the topic is delicate and his opinion might be ""controversial. But you can't blame him for that. Some people, especially the younger ones, just don't have their opinion.  The only constructive criticism I can have for Lirik is, don't pay attention to the small bunch of vocal dipshits. For each one of those adorable potatoes, you have 5 or more fans that love you!  When comes to online chat, there's not really much Lirik or us mods can do, unless we would go full Auschwitz.  I have no idea, why I spent 10 minutes on this comment, but whatever.

DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,E38V12,3,Tue Jun 16 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"I know I've said this before in this sub but I really think you have to compare things said on twitch by streamers to things like what Howard Stern says on radio. Since Stern moved to Sirius, he owns his channels, he can say what he wants, when he wants. Sometimes he tells people off and if you don't like it, well he doesn't care. (and there are tons of people who don't like him because of it)  This can really be applied to Lirik too. If people don't like it, thats totally fine, Lirik doesn't care.. If he doesn't care, then I don't care, and I'll continue to watch."
DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,davidhero,8,Tue Jun 16 13:34:02 2015 UTC,Uhhhh I kinda miss the ARMA 3 BR because he was really good at it and it was always very exciting to watch. So basically I miss a game that lirik is super good in? I'm not trying to insult but yeah thats it I think. Other than that it's fine and I don't really read chat/participate.
DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,Jolieftw,2,Tue Jun 16 10:54:33 2015 UTC,"I understand. Lirik's stream for me is basically warm up to A3L, A3L itself, and then winding down from A3L. I'd never ask him to play it in chat, as I know it's a semi regular game. But for some reason, I just want him to play it everyday even though I know it would even get old for me.  Other than that, I don't quite focus on what game he plays, and just chat with people. Love you chat lirikH"

You feel close to that person/those people. Like igneus that fat fuck. He always talks rude to me but i find it really funny. Because i know hes just joking (i hope).   What i would change?

DatGuyLirik,3a0igb,Geoppetto,2,Tue Jun 16 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, so, I've been watching for maybe 2 years now and I really enjoy Lirik's stream and his style. What I think would improve the stream immensely is if people stopped feeling entitled to everything. Lirik does his thing and always has and probably always will. Don't nag about the game he is, or is not, playing. I don't always enjoy the life mods, but then I do something else and go back later if I feel like it. It's not like he's gonna change game because someone asks in chat. It only creates negativity and hostility. Same goes for a lot of things.  I realize this is an Internet chat with many thousands of people and there's no way it will ever be perfect, but if we can make just a few people behave in a more positive manner it will spread and be better.    TLDR: Think before you type and be positive! You, and everyone around you will feel better and like you more."

But if he should change anything ""for the better according to me"" it would be:    Take a vacation (he deserves it). Play what he wants to play, not what chat wants him to play (looking at you Ark, and A3L). Stream games which arent ""streamable"" (I for one is super happy about single saturday) as long as it is what he wants to play.   Besides those 3, he should carry on just like he does. Keep on being outspoken and unfiltered, thats what makes him entertaining."

Chat is a massive 50k people echo chamber of Lirik's opinion and that is because if he's in a certain mood, he will call you out and talk shit to you for not agreeing. And that of course causes a massive wave of REKT and LMAO in chat.... I tried going in against his opinion about Rust in a donation once. I thought I'd brought up a good point. He just called me salty, didn't even thank me. Like... I wasn't even complaining, I was just sharing an opinion that wasn't his. After that i stopped resubbing and donating.

I simply donated saying that I did NOT see that difference at all, because I had put in hours and hours of gameplay in Rust as well and lost everything over and over again. So what's the difference?

DatGuyLirik,39xhip,Euradys,4,Mon Jun 15 17:28:19 2015 UTC,First mistake was taking twitch chat seriously and giving a shit about all the mindless spam.
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,Joonaa,3,Mon Jun 15 17:31:03 2015 UTC,yeah much sheep.

DatGuyLirik,39xhip,JixieZ,3,Tue Jun 16 04:37:42 2015 UTC,"The gaming community is full of sheeps. Nothing new here. Funny thing is, DOOM was meh at most yesterday but NOOOO, the holy gaming community has decided that everyone must shit on Microsoft and praise Bethesda. This is sad."
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,Short_Kings,2,Tue Jun 16 19:11:39 2015 UTC,"I actually thought doom looked amazing. Especially with the map creation and mission creator. Tops halo forge imo. Because halo has made so many games it's hard to get excited for a new one. But I mean I understand everyone likes something different and that's what is so great about gaming, there is something for everyone!"
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,JohnDoh666,5,Mon Jun 15 16:45:16 2015 UTC,Or maybe we just have people with differing opinions in a chat of couple of thousand people...
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,TrollingGuinea,4,Mon Jun 15 16:51:54 2015 UTC,Or maybe everyone is spamming trash until lirik says he likes something then they spam GOTY and 10/10
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,forHonorDotA,8,Mon Jun 15 17:02:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a large portion of his chat does this. It can get a little annoying that when Lirik says something, no matter what it is, people will agree with it simply because he said it. I personally don't see it as too big of a deal, but hey, that's just me."
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,mikelitorise,0,Mon Jun 15 17:27:09 2015 UTC,Or maybe it's different people spamming different things?
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,19cocaine95,5,Mon Jun 15 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"So it's just a coincidence that the change from trash to hype or viceversa happens exactly at the moment lirik says something? Multiple times trough the whole day?  Yeah, I don't think so man."
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,bacje16,0,Mon Jun 15 18:23:25 2015 UTC,It's really hard to belive that someone actually agrees with him without being a fanboy in a chat with 20 000 people right?  Or wait... is it you that's a upset Fallout fanboy that can't stand that lirik is all meh about your game?
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,DUHDUM,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:23:41 2015 UTC,Forming your own opinion? I thought that was something only famous people could do...
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,Yomanpepsican,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:01:25 2015 UTC,"That's what happens in every streamers chat and its not even weird, streamer says something and the people who share the same idea (in this case people who think fallout 4 will be bad or the fallout haters) gets encouraged to spam their thoughts.   Also another thing is, there're games that makes almost everybody get hyped, and they're not low in amount, so there's a high chance for majority of chat liking the same game with Lirik. Then Lirik types something into chat and this is not something usual except e3 days etc, so people are being like ""omg he typed something into chat, like we do all the time"" and the kappa train effect starts.  The only time that I agree with you is, the actual sheeps which are low in amount (maybe 1/10 of subs or less), but every streamer has some of them (they're everywhere tho, like the sheeps of politicians/movie stars/athletes). In your case, they're the ones who spam trash and poop when Lirik gives shit to Fallout 4, and then they'll spam 10/10 and goty if Lirik starts to change his thoughts about Fallout 4.  Also one last thing, welcome to the twitch chat, where even the most sane people may want to be the part of mindless spams. If you won't care about what I said above, just close the chat and ignore the chatty box in the stream window. Have a good E3 week."
DatGuyLirik,39xhip,Limelol,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:17:59 2015 UTC,One way of looking at this is have a look at his streams and see the number of chats of people that disagree with any of his opinions.. hardly NONE. Most don't because they probably know how they will be treated: not only by chat or mods but by Lirik himself. Y'all should know this: not every critic is a hater.
DatGuyLirik,3a4pac,19cocaine95,2,Wed Jun 17 05:15:46 2015 UTC,"As much as I don't like the game, I can appreciate good art.  These look like they took a while to produce and are of high quality."

DatGuyLirik,3a392s,adamcsay,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:03:43 2015 UTC,"Ark needs A LOT of polish to get it to be nearly as entertaining as Rust is. The UI is awful, there's little to no PVP given that leveling and weapon access are solely based on XP farming, which can be exploited, building requires absurd amounts of resources which can be farmed in ridiculous amounts once you tame certain dinos, it's kinda dumb. The game had promise, and still does, but it would need to copy/paste Rust over the current code, and port in dinos. Otherwise, I don't see it lasting."

DatGuyLirik,39tuar,ihatemaps,20,Mon Jun 15 05:13:24 2015 UTC,It's just a joke that has got a bit old.  If he wanted to sell out there'd be much more lucrative ways to do so.

I don't blame him at all, btw. This is his job: there is no pension, no health care plan, no secure industry to move up in. This is a job and a risk, and he's clearly very calculated (behind the scenes) about making it a monetary success too. Good for him. But if you consider trying to get subs or trying to monetize his stream as selling out, he sold out a very long time ago."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,earth159,3,Sun Jun 14 19:58:06 2015 UTC,"I think what hes saying, is that relative to the VAST majority of twitch, Lirik doesn't utilize many corny ways to profit of viewers at all. Sure he accepts donations and sets a minimum to dissuade people from repetitively disrupting the stream, but what is that compared to like every other streamer on twitch?  Top contributor boards, giveways and mod privileges given to contributors are all a common occurrence on the site, and people are calling him a ""sellout""? I hear you, he makes good money and if you want your message in front of 30k people you have to pay $3, but sellout? It is a FACT that Lirik would get far more huge donations if he had a donation board and ""top donator"" and stuff like that but he chooses not to, so personally, i disagree."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,AManAPlanAvacado,7,Mon Jun 15 01:59:54 2015 UTC,It would be pretty cool if he just picked the last X people who subbed instead of announcing the next few people who subbed would get to participate.  That way it wouldn't necessarily encourage a shit ton of subs and make it seem like he's selling out.
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,FilthyNonSub,-1,Mon Jun 15 03:59:46 2015 UTC,That way it wouldn't necessarily make it seem like he's selling out.   As if he really cares what idiots like that think.

Guys, lets spam SELLOUT so he changes it! xD""  There's a reason why Lirik (and most other top broadcasters) mainly ignores those types of idiots.

He tries to pull it twice or so every game, each time it takes 5 minutes, really annoying.  edit: apparently I'm the only one who wants gameplay and not staring at some input box for minutes - every few minutes."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,ikwtif,-12,Mon Jun 15 04:05:21 2015 UTC,"It's not that bad. Nightstreams are alot worse lately in that respect. They don't know what to play so just browse steam, play crappy aigor/wait ages for each other, or just set up things that they should do oustide of the stream, in my opinion (like the E3 stream thing they set up).  Before they just didn't do nightstreams when there was nothing to play, now they don't seem to care that much."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,SLVRRR,7,Sun Jun 14 21:57:52 2015 UTC,I mean.. kind of? The big difference is that subsunday is official streaming time. Whereas lirik started the nightstreams back then for a more relaxed stream AFTER his official stream.
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,ikwtif,0,Sun Jun 14 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"But nightstreams where never about not playing games. If they didn't know what to play it was about playing games that wheren't his main-game. Now, nightstreams feel forced. And for example doing a setup for E3 shouldn't be streamed at all, that's something for behind the scenes, that's not remotely what a nightstream should be (haven't even seen them using the gary's mod for E3 so far). Just like browsing steam for a whole hour to find games...those things shouldn't happen during a live stream at all. They don't stream casually, it's their job, so these things should happen outside of the stream. It's one of the things I respected Lirik for, he was professional in this. Lately it feels like he doesn't care about it that much, at least not during nightstreams, wich is a shame.  Everything streamed is official, it's not because they label it nightstream it should be regarded as non-official. The only thing official about his ""official stream"" is that he plays his main games, nothing more."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,hilariousninja,20,Sun Jun 14 20:52:39 2015 UTC,"It started as a joke, but its kind of gotten out of hand with him working it into every single subsunday game. I thought lirik would be above this kind of nonsense"
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,ThisIsReLLiK,2,Sun Jun 14 21:22:41 2015 UTC,"He sold out for his $3 cut of the new sub? Compared to what he makes, I don't think you can call this selling out."

DatGuyLirik,39tuar,drewson87,-6,Sun Jun 14 19:21:16 2015 UTC,Lirikripp. Welcome to the $5 bandits!
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,BooWillbury,-8,Mon Jun 15 14:38:51 2015 UTC,"Sub Sunday has always been full sellout mode lets be honest here. The whole ""sub now and I will name something after you"" is just half of it. Look at the games that get chosen, so many of them release just days before the cast and some are even closed access. I mean is it just a coincidence that Mehdi is playing Big Pharm today on his cast and also interviewing the devs?   Can't really prove this obviously, but it is a very easy way to make deals for airtime whilst making it look legitimate. All a dev would need do is subscribe and vote for their game...and it gets chosen, no one can really say anything as games with 1 vote can technically get chosen (and have multiple times).  Perhaps I should remove my tinfoil hat, but I have this feeling for a long time...that Sub Sunday is far less about the subs and more about what Lirik wants to play/gets incentives to play."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,bicarbofyoda,18,Sun Jun 14 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"Mehdi has always had a day devoted to indie games and has featured plenty of games that lirik hasn't played.  People want to see new releases and hence vote for them, which is why they are often played on Sub Sunday. Lirik has stated before he has been offered money to play games and talk about them favourably and has turned it down. If I was a dev I'd be worried about him playing my game; he's brutally honest in my experience.  Did the sellout thing get out of hand and cringey? Yes, but I imagine Lirik will read this and drop it. Every single thing he does can't be funny and work all the time (I remember when he had text to speech donations for a week or so)  Some of these replies are crazy though."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,BooWillbury,-4,Sun Jun 14 22:20:50 2015 UTC,"You make some fair points, but we really can't prove it either way. I have always wondered why Lirik doesn't just broadcast the choices at the end of his Friday stream, then there would be no justification for my original post.  Yes I agree, people do vote for new releases (we can see this in the poll results which are posted every week). But the frequency of them getting chosen is what I am concerned about.   Lets take week 19 for example, which was streamed 3rd of May. He played:  Software Inc. - 1 vote and was released 1st of May. Cosmochoria - 4 votes and was released 27th of April Silent Hill:Alchemilla - 1 vote and was released 17th of January (major update 3rd of April) WWE 2k15 - 29 votes and was released 28th of April Chroma Squad - 13 votes and was released 30th of April Dirt Rally - 37 votes and was released 27th of April Kerbal Space Program - 52 votes and was released 27th of April  All but 1 game was released in the week leading up to that weeks Sub Sunday. Yes it could all be down to chance, but I just don't believe it...this happens every week.  Again, could just be me thinking too much about this...but to believe that Lirik wouldn't take a some sort of incentive to play a particular game is naive imo.  EDIT: Just another two I thought to mention. Exanima played 17/05 released 29/04 (he missed a subsunday on 10/05) - Exanima was a game which I knew of two other streamers who had streaming deals with the devs and had played the game on their casts. Kholat played 07/06 released 09/06 - again, another game which had deals with other streamers and was not even released when Lirik played the game on this day."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,Pedarsen,7,Sun Jun 14 21:42:38 2015 UTC,"I think you need to put your tin foil hat back in the closet where it belongs.  You are just using random stuff as ""proof"" for this. 5 out of 7 games today were old games. Did he play old games this week to throw away the suspicion of Big Pharm!??!??!?!"
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,BooWillbury,-1,Sun Jun 14 22:22:20 2015 UTC,"Not at all.   As I said, not ALL games are ones which I would suspect are paid/incentivized in some way. However I would argue that some certainly are. I could go back and match up release dates to the dates they appeared on stream, but I don't much think people will appreciate the gesture. There is also much more said in the casts themselves which have caused me to feel this way, such as the permabanning of any criticism and the overly positive way he can react to games he will NEVER play again."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,Pedarsen,2,Sun Jun 14 22:40:29 2015 UTC,Using that is just silly. I have loads of games in my steam library that i have played for like 30min to 1 hour and i really enjoy. It's just don't touch them anymore for other reasons.  If all this was really the case then we would have seen more games beeing played on the regular streams imo.
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,bicarbofyoda,2,Sun Jun 14 22:55:49 2015 UTC,"He has said plenty of times he wants to save 'x' new release for Sub Sunday, which he feels is one of the main points of the day. It's pretty obvious he doesn't just draw 8 or so games and play them, he just uses the votes as prompts as far as I can tell.  It would be interesting to see how many of those new games he has played that he has shit talked, which would have been a pretty poor investment from devs if they had indeed paid him.  I'd suggest you were being cynical rather than me naive, but agree there is no way we can tell for sure and appreciate that you're putting your point across in the right way unlike some in here."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,BooWillbury,-1,Sun Jun 14 23:05:40 2015 UTC,"He has said plenty of times he wants to save 'x' new release for Sub Sunday, which he feels is one of the main points of the day. It's pretty obvious he doesn't just draw 8 or so games and play them, he just uses the votes as prompts as far as I can tell.   Well I would argue that it should therefore not be called ""Sub Sunday"" - if the subs choices are essentially meaningless then it is disingenuous to call it as such.  There are many games which Lirik is overly positive about as well though, take StoneHearth which in my opinion did not deserve the praise he gave it. Exanima was another that Lirik was particular positive about, along with Software Inc. and Kholat.   But yeah, maybe I am just being cynical but this isn't as if I am just hating on Lirik for no reason. I love his broadcast but I feel that in certain aspects he is trying to pull wool over our eyes."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,hilariousninja,5,Mon Jun 15 12:58:18 2015 UTC,Where the fuck did I say he was doing anything extreme? All i'm saying is that he's appearing as a bit of a hypocrite because he has criticised streamers that go fullout sellout mode and has boasted that he doesn't like that kind of BS.   Get your head out of his ass and see reason mate.

If Lirik really wanted to be a sellout, I'm sure he would do much more cheap things than just the name of something in game."

DatGuyLirik,39tuar,bacje16,2,Sun Jun 14 21:24:14 2015 UTC,"I'd argue it's pretty clever. Minimum work for pretty good profit. Every time he does that he gets 5-10 subs, if he does that 10 times during the stream it's 50-100 subs, meaning 250-500 dollars per month minus twitch tax.  Fuck, I'd do it."

Its a bit extra money for the guy we all love, so all the wealth to him. He doesnt force anyone to sub and I like it as a way to interact with his community more. And he is far away from being a sellout. He always said he turn down deals from game companies and most sponsors. Also name one streamer as big as him who interacts with his chat so much. If he wanted money, he would just play a3l all day."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,FusselP0wner,2,Mon Jun 15 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"LOL, this is so funny, lirik makes fun of all the sellout streamers, and you guys dont even realize it. Chill the fuck down, lirik is an awesome guy."
DatGuyLirik,39tuar,drewson87,2,Mon Jun 15 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"I remember when Kripp always talked about sell out streamers and he wouldn't acknowledge subs. Then he started as a joke saying ""wecome to the $5 club (subname)"" and giving an ""ironic brofist"". Well its like a year later and he's still doing it. And he sells t-shirts. And he got sponsored by a gambling company, and shills for nVidia shields, etc. and so on and so on.  Its just what happens when you offer people money especially in a field thats uncharted like streaming. Who knows if this job will even exist for much longer if at all? Better make that $ while you can."

Please don't bring that argument into this.   As for ""sell out mode"" no comment, tho I will say honestly if I was him I'd do it to I mean why not easy money. But I really don't care for sub Sunday the games are mostly boring & I don't watch on weekends cause of life & if I am on twitch I prefer LCS & other tournaments that are on the weekends.   I will say this tho some people here & a lot of people in chat really seem revolve their lives around Lirik whether they are complaining about every little shit thing he does, I mean why care right I appreciate good criticism which I have seen here but a lot of comes off as whining needless bitching. At the same the white knight defense Lirik gets is also out of control, the blind sheep that repeat everything he does is really strong, Lirik hates something so do you anyone that doesn't agree basically gets called ""adorable"". Even worse those that will harass other streamers in Lirik's name for no reason, can't tell how many streams I've been lately with people telling said streamer ""they suck Lirik is better"" it's pathetic those people seriously get a life Lirik is not asking for you to do that & if he saw you doing it I'm sure he'd ban you from his chat. Basically if you don't like what Lirik does then find another channel for the day, he does not care much for our opinion & we should accept that unless he asks for it, chat annoys you then do what I do most streams go full screen or find another channel Twitch has so many great streamers."

The shame is that both sides have their loud parts that will spout vitriol towards the other, both adding to the problem and a lot of the time it eventually ends up grinding down on Lirik as well. Exhibit A is the ramp up in his backlashes at stuff recently compared to how he was a year ago let alone two years ago.

DatGuyLirik,39vqtd,combatrifle,0,Tue Jun 16 13:25:05 2015 UTC,"Never mind that, there are beautiful people on reddit that are obsessed with him allegedly cheating in DayZ few years ago. He puts out a lot of great content and the only thing some individuals on reddit remember is him supposedly cheating (very little solid evidence, it was never really proven) and it brings out their inner virgins."
DatGuyLirik,39vqtd,lefiath,5,Mon Jun 15 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"I actually used to defend Frankie like mad until I saw a video of him allegedly admitting it and there was a lot of surrounding stuff I read into that just made me dislike him.  Never talked trash about him though, certainly made for an entertaining series of videos just felt as if I couldn't go on subscribed to him on Youtube after that."
DatGuyLirik,39vqtd,Portrend,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:25:47 2015 UTC,"If anything, he never admitted it, and had very hostile attitude about the whole incident, which obviously rubbed many people the wrong way, especially some people on reddit that aren't used to being told to fuck off. I personally think he hacked, but there was very little evidence that could be counted as solid, therefore it was never definetely proven.   The thing is, some people made such a big thing out of it that after years they're still capable of throwing a temper tantrum over it as if it was such a big deal for them. They forgot to move on - he got away with it, and I just don't think it's worth to constantly mention this, sadly some redditors can't let it go just like people still using arrow in the knee jokes. I simply enjoy watching his content, he does a great job even with one fuck up. I think he's a bit of a dick, but as long as what he does entertains me, I don't mind."
DatGuyLirik,39vqtd,lefiath,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:53:56 2015 UTC,"""He got away with it."" Thats the point.  Its his job to play games and Im fine with that. But if you cheat in real life, lets say doing something illegal as police officer, you WILL get shit for it and you will likely lose your job. Maybe its just because people who cheat piss me off to a level you couldnt imagine, or maybe it is because Frankie always said how much he hated cheaters (even dedicated 1 episode to a rant) and still did it. He is a hypocrite and for me, a bad person. Call me an idiot for caring so much, but it just triggers me that his fanboy army tries to silence everyone who mention this and just acts like it never happend."
DatGuyLirik,39vqtd,combatrifle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:20:01 2015 UTC,"You should move on. I'm not gonna call you an idiot, but is this seriously that important to you? Worse things happen in life... I don't even know why you use real life comparisons of something serious, when this has nothing to do with it, that certainly didn't help me understanding your viewpoint. I get pissed at people online, sure, but I don't hold grudge for years like some... also, don't you think you can give people second chance? From what you're saying here, I could almost see you being prepared to chop off someone's hand for cheating :)   As a person that regularly has to deal with cheaters (and I've been banned many times in CS and Battlefield for ""cheating"", aka killing admins), I despise them as well, but people that do it again and again just to mess with others are real problem, not some youtuber that was apparently desperate to get some interesting material. If I encounter cheater in battlefield for example, I just leave server, perhaps went off a bit, and then I forget about it. If anything, I think the positive effect of his preaching against cheaters outweights his possible cheating in few episodes in DayZ."
DatGuyLirik,39vqtd,lefiath,2,Tue Jun 16 18:46:12 2015 UTC,"I think you got me wrong. I dont really care about him, I dont watch his videos and get my POV in arguments like this every now and then. Im not some guy who cares enough to go around and post everywhere that ""THIS GUY IS A CHEATER!!1!!"".   Im playing CS aswell, a lot actually. This is also how I learned to hate cheater so much. Its just depressing to know people have fun by destroying the experience for others and before you judge, see it that way. A Cheater in your game and you lose motivation to play, you still have to stay around, wasting time on nothing. Just so someone else can have fun by messing with you and up to 8 others (CS).  See, I dont see why not. Its his job. Just as it is someone elses job to get people who deal drugs, its unacceptable for him to deal drugs himself. So it should be unacceptable for a Youtuber/Gamer who earns a lot of money through that to cheat. Also, people like him are the people others look up to, call them losers call them kiddies, some people want to be like him.   If he is cheating, its ok, so why not do it myself, right?   My examples may be horrible, but I hope you get my point. He may be clean now, but someone who does everything just to get more clicks and more money is, for me atleast, not a person who deserves a second chance. Then again, Im a person who thinks noone deserves a second chance."

DatGuyLirik,39nu99,Loryk,46,Sat Jun 13 03:28:57 2015 UTC,"He's also repeatedly put down this subreddit on stream, calling everyone here stupid and useless (in a serious way), etc. To every poster that means ""everyone else here"" and ""not me"", so they all follow his lead and let everyone in this subreddit know how stupid they are while sucking his dick.   This includes the mods, btw, who censor any even subtle criticism or observation about Lirik. To be fair though, he sets the example of crass negativity: he is really bad at handling even the most carefully written constructive criticism."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,airikewr,12,Sat Jun 13 14:32:25 2015 UTC,Kind of sad that he puts down his own subreddit. I get that it might not be perfect but negativity breeds negativity and vice versa. I think it could be great if people went in with a better attitude. Same goes for chat.
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,herrodenorth,21,Sat Jun 13 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you. I don't understand why mods/lirik deletes threads with constructive feedback, where even some of his moderators participate. One of the most recent examples was the thread about the arma 2 ts event, where some people were saying in a very polite and friendly way he needed some vacation time to rest and come back at full power, since they were noticing Lirik has been in a bad mood frequently this past weeks and that maybe he was burnt out. No one was bashing him, it was just people giving their own opinion based on their own experiences. This thread ended up being removed by someone and 2 new ones about the same topic were created, but were allowed to stay since there were only sheepish comments praising Lirik on how well he reacted to the admin.  Another example would be a thread I created about getting 5 ads in the same hour, where people said he should consider lowering the ads he plays, but always understanding it was his choice and they would respect it. Other people were saying to sub and so on... Even though the topic had constructive criticism in it it was deleted because only a small amount of people were circlejerking about his holly figure, saying to sub or f*ck off when I originally said that I just wanted to keep his stream whitelisted since watching the ads was the only way I had to support him and show appreciation for what he does.  Without any doubt he is the one in charge, but he should really learn how to take criticism when people are trying to help and being polite instead of removing threads and bashing non-circlejerkers.    People should really check VODs from 2 years ago if they haven't, even tough lirik didn't have so many epic moments as he has now, he used to be so cheerful, happy, laughing every 3 minutes. Nowadays he seems kind of tired and drained out of his characteristic happiness and that kind allowed his edginess to grow."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,Yomanpepsican,7,Sat Jun 13 17:00:02 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more with you guys. I'm glad this has all been said, but I have a feeling this post isn't going to last much longer. They can't handle the truth as it would seem..."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,warmingglow,-1,Sat Jun 13 18:08:55 2015 UTC,deIlluminati
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,Yomanpepsican,3,Sun Jun 14 02:52:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. About a month ago there was a thread that was negative toward the calls coming in to Hotline, and providing constructive criticism on how people should plan the calls better and try to think of things to say rather than just saying hi and giving shout outs to chat. The consensus on this subreddit was ""Lirik can do what he wants if you don't like it gtfo."" Two weeks later he cancelled Hotline because he said the calls sucked.  There was another pretty popular thread last month criticizing the new emotes. It was also approached in a constructive manner, with many people agreeing, and one of the mods (Anna?) said something to the effect of ""if you don't like it don't watch.""  This is the most ridiculous type of argument. Lirik has even asked this subreddit for criticism in the past. This is a business in the six figures. He can't just get online and play games. It is important to know your audience and what they want to see."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,Yomanpepsican,-5,Sun Jun 14 15:10:53 2015 UTC,"Bro what're you talking about, the post with the comments about lirik needing a vacation are still there. http://www.reddit.com/r/DatGuyLirik/comments/39bcvt/go_fuck_yourself/ I think you'd be stretching to say the thread was deleted because of those comments...

DatGuyLirik,39nu99,Yomanpepsican,4,Sun Jun 14 02:45:36 2015 UTC,"Yep. Lirik is always negative towards his viewers. He may say its a joke, but its still kinda mean."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,RagingElbaboon,3,Sun Jun 14 09:37:42 2015 UTC,"My own thread got deleted or removed silently, it being a joke, by the mods or Lirik. So I'm not surprised.  http://www.reddit.com/r/DatGuyLirik/comments/3809qk/lirik_playing_homesick_on_subsunday/  It was at the top and a few hours later it was gone. You do have to realize a large portion of lirik's viewers are extremely immature and young, it is not that surprising that he holds that view, it's his abrasive behavior compared to others that people then have these topics come up."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,nys0,-2,Sun Jun 14 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"It was probably removed because that image was posted so many times, I remember seeing at least three including yours. I mean cmon, I highly doubt that the mods, who also talk shit to lirik ALL the time, would remove a post that was CLEARLY humorous. It's not how they are, and it's not how Lirik is either, and that's the type of stream he maintains.  I'm kind of shocked how so many people don't get sarcasm, like Lirik (even a lot of subs) talk shit to non subs all the time and it's super funny. Ofc they don't mean it, but if a non sub actually gets butthurt because of such a joke then he reaaaallly shouldn't be in Lirik's channel."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,bacje16,-13,Sun Jun 14 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"I would NEVER describe Lirik as toxic. He might call chat a bunch of fucking idiots, or shit talk his subreddit but if you think he's 100% serious about that I don't know what to say lol. He has an online persona, do you seriously think he walks around in real life calling people a bunch of fucking retards (Although that would be hilarious)? Edgy is a great description IMO.  What I think (and I'm sure most will agree) is that 97% of the people that watch the stream, chat in chat, and check out this subreddit are not toxic at all. I would go as far to say that less than 3% are actually toxic.    Whether or not he takes criticism well... I mean.... Looking through a lot of old posts by him... It's sort of debatable lol. However, often times the criticism he gets is not carefully written constructive criticism. It's usually a butt hurt fan reminiscing about the ""old days"" and how Lirik doesn't care about his viewers anymore for one reason or another (mind you he went from 1-3k ---> 30k+). Sub hotline was born out of the idea that he wanted to get to know his viewers better. I would love to see it's return but maybe once every other month so it doesn't get stale (Constructive criticism! Yay!).   As for the mods censoring criticism, can you give an example? I just can't see Lirik even having mods that would go all Ellen Pao in chat. Now, if someone is just shit talking and spamming constantly about how lirik ""should play this and not that because I like this better"" they should be banned. They are part of the ~3%. Lirik always chooses what he plays, and everyone should know that by now unless you're new to the stream. And since only subs can talk most of the time...  As for the OP, I posted a video I made here (it sucks, but i'm a Political Science major lol) and I literally got no insults. This community is actually very diverse and supportive, but that ~3% loves spamming chat and reddit to get a rise out of anyone that they can.  All Lirik wants to do is play video games. It wasn't his choice to become this big. And, honestly, it must be infuriating for him to take all of this time to make his stream the best it can be for some idiot to come in and say something like...  ""Lirik is just lazy when it comes down to it. He doesn't care what his viewers want to see. Now before you down vote this because you blindly follow lirik I dare you to think about it. He's very stubborn when it comes to new ideas and now his stream is deteriorating due to it. Sub sunday is what kept his stream fresh from the constant prison time in a3l. I hope he sees this and realizes how important it is to keep it fresh.""  (-Taken from http://www.reddit.com/r/DatGuyLirik/comments/33325b/all_these_great_ideas_for_the_stream_keep/)  The really terrible thing is that no one thinks/cares about how he feels. You can go back and listen to some of his older broadcasts and hear how this whole blowing up thing has changed him. He's only human, of course he's going to get mad sometimes, but calling him toxic is just wrong IMO."

I don't expect him to be extremely rational and analytical about everything but he should at least attempt to be nice to the people who love what he does and want to help him grow into a even bigger streamer, but generalizing all subs (and non subs for that matter) and bashing them every other day is another option too that seems to be his favorite.  This guy is an example of someone who tries to be constructive but comes out in a harsh way mainly to the hyperbole he uses, but Lirik's response is completely out of proportion and behaves like an insecure teenage girl insulting the guy on the start and swearing every other sentence."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,nys0,12,Sat Jun 13 17:32:50 2015 UTC,"The first paragraph tells everything really. He calls him out as a pussy because he didn't use his twitch username when you can clearly see the very reason that guy did that - he felt that Lirik was fickle enough that if he posted his opinion on reddit under his ""real"" name, he'd risk getting banned in twitch chat. And lo and behold, he was right (I presume that if Lirik actually went to check if that account exists, he'd click that ban button as well while he was at it).  Which really is a terrible thing that it came so far, that people have to hide under different names if they want to state their opinion, because they fear repercussions (presuming they are not trolls - and I don't think he was)."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,Yomanpepsican,5,Sat Jun 13 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"I don't see this example as something coming from an idiot. It could be better worded, but it's still a valid opinion. You can argue against it, with your own arguments, but he really hasn't said anything THAT offensive.  This is just another example of how some of the people like to think of him as a delicate flower that needs to be shielded from any kind of criticism, which in turn makes the whole situation even worse since he literally became one.  And nobody caring what he thinks, that he's only a human is a void argument. Does Lirik think how developers feel when he slams their game on stream? Do you, when you spam lirikREKT and lirikTRASH while he's slamming it? They are only human too you know. Do you think how all of movie makers, musicians and whatever feel when you criticize their product? No, you probably don't. Because this is entertainment industry and this is how it works. So if you enjoy praise you better be ready to eat some shit too."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,RagingElbaboon,8,Sat Jun 13 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"You pretty much hit the nail right on the head. Even though people should value Lirik's opinion for what it is, sometimes he is very harsh with some games he plays, when he doesn't understand the game because he decided not to do the tutorial since he is no ""n00b"". Being the game development industry one of the worst and where most employees are explored, something like this could hit them really hard on the short term. So saying he doesn't bend over when criticizing games and then not being able to take some honest feedback himself is being kind of hypocrite."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,bacje16,2,Sat Jun 13 17:47:56 2015 UTC,"Can you give an example where he unjustly crucified a game? Even with games that he subjectively would never like, he is aware of that. For example, sunless sea, a game with a lot of reading; he quit that game very early and didn't say OH WHAT A SHIT GAME, but instead he said ""not my type of game.""  Homeworld is another game that is definitely not lirik's type of game, but he was very fair when he played through it. From my experience, I find Lirik to understand both the difference between objectivity and subjectivity as well as the the effect of his opinion on his viewers."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,RagingElbaboon,-4,Sun Jun 14 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"Woah woah woah, for the record, I said absolutely NOTHING about the point he was trying to make. Simply the way it was said. Which was pretty insulting, even if unintended. And totally agree with you on the ""better be ready to eat some shit too"" part, however being in the entertainment business doesn't mean celebrities aren't allowed to get upset or shit talk their fans. That's what i meant by being human."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,bacje16,5,Sat Jun 13 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"As we can see in his reply, Lirik is not the most articulate person either. So I don't think it's really fair holding him accountable for being a bit crude. The point is what matters IMO."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,RagingElbaboon,-5,Sat Jun 13 18:17:31 2015 UTC,A bit crude... He called him lazy and told him that he didn't care about his viewers. That's not a bit crude. That's just plain rude man. And I'm not sure the point you are trying to make? That Lirik shouldn't get upset when people (EVEN IF UNINTENDED) shit talk him?
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,VickFVM,5,Sat Jun 13 18:22:57 2015 UTC,"I'd use ""lazy"" too for the lack of a better word. Lazy not in a sense that he doesn't do shit, but lazy as in he rarely puts any effort in something that is out of his comfort zone. And you can't deny it. For example, how many times he stopped playing singleplayer games because ""he didn't feel like it"" even though if by some miracle he was convinced to continue, he usually enjoyed it? Single Saturday is a step in the right direction, I admit.  As for the other one, he regularly says that he doesn't care what chat wants him to play, he plays what he wants. So I don't know how is saying the same thing considered rude.  And he can shit talk the trolls all he wants, but he shit talks the people who express their opinion too (not to mention calling out so chat can unleash their fury too) and by doing that he alienates people.  Also, as a public person he should show some restraint and realize that some people won't like him and learn to look beyond that, instead of having a fight with every single person that stands in his way. He comes across as an entitled douche when he does that."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,teepa,-1,Sat Jun 13 18:33:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, he might not want to come out of his comfort zone. I won't deny that. I agree he needs to keep his stream fresh. The only thing I disagree with was the way it was said. Which, again, was very rude.   Every streamer streams for their viewers. Because they wan't to provide a quality stream for their viewers. And it's not just what games he plays. It's maintaining consistency (12pm 6 days a week unless RL happens), keeping up to date on the latest tech, downloading all the games for sub sunday etc etc... He decides what he wants to play because if he plays something that's not enjoyable for him, it won't be enjoyable for us. That's why he picks what he picks to stream, not because he doesn't give a fuck about what his viewers want to see.   BTW, I do enjoy watching Lirik. But I'm not so far up his ass that I won't criticize him. There are times when I'm bored with the game he's playing or the things he does (sub hotline every saturday) I just change the stream, and that's that."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,cxco2r,5,Sat Jun 13 18:56:47 2015 UTC,I wonder how long this post is gonna last until someone removes it.
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,krikit_,6,Sun Jun 14 01:49:11 2015 UTC,I agree that the stream has gone downhill for a time now and that Lirik seriously seems to be burnt out. He has also become somewhat toxic and quite annoying to watch actually.
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,Nilwx,3,Sun Jun 14 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"I hate to agree with this but yes... I can tell he's getting tired of it. Before he did it for fun, now it's just a job to him. I wouldn't mind him taking a break before he's conpl consumed."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,RagingElbaboon,20,Mon Jun 15 16:15:12 2015 UTC,"Lirik used to be a very good and frequent streamer, right now i feel as though he is doing it mostly because of the money. In all seriousness comparing streams before and right now is showing how much he changed. He divided the whole community and right now every person who is not subbed to him is not respected at all and gets shit on by everything they say. Especially other subs having literally zero respect towards other people whos opinion is just as important as theirs. Nonsubs are  90% of liriks viewers. Everyone has their reason not to sub and subs have no right to judge them but Lirik keeps supporting them. In the past this community was nice and friendly to people and I remember it. Lirik streamed frequently and now every second day, is a day off. Most of the streams are repetitive and he needs to take a shit on at least 20 people on stream because of their opinion. Subs think they have so much privileges because they give lirik money that it is crazy. I was a sub myself for a long time but this community made me not to. There is just so much disrespect and Lirik keeps supporting it not by just agreeing to it but disrespecting others who make him stream and who built his stream with him from zero. Before viewers were ones who were listened but now if you say something, you are most likely going to get banned just as i will soon when someone of the mods, or lirik, read this message. If anyone gets offended by this, just so you know this is my opinion, and i dont give a shit if you have anything against it. Peace."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,-l--l-,8,Sat Jun 13 20:21:22 2015 UTC,"Lirik streamed frequently and now every second day, is a day off.   I can empathize with the rest of your comment, but do you really believe that this is a true statement?  He's taken two days off only this week, and you somehow think that this is the rule when it's only an exception."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,-l--l-,0,Sun Jun 14 15:28:23 2015 UTC,he works 50 hour weeks and people shit on him for not streaming enough lmao
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,bacje16,2,Sun Jun 14 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"Im here with you, i've been watching lirik since 2012 when he had around 4-6k viewers on Arma 2 he was very nice and entertaining guy. i have never subbed him because im 16 right now and i have now more important things to get in my life as im not so ritch and dont have money spend on Twitch sub. He wasnt such a dickhead before towards nonsubs and chat was not 24/7 submode but again i understand he gets 20-30k viewers and chat might go sometimes full retard but still its quite sad how things are going right on Liriks channel now compared good old times. :/"
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,InconspiciousMonkey,3,Sun Jun 21 02:57:24 2015 UTC,"Members of the community are still nice and friendly man. There are just more people, which leads to more idiots.   I compare the non-sub rhetoric to Meg from Family Guy or the proverbial ""red headed step-child."" It's a joke man. Take it like a joke lol.   Also, TBH, subs (and i'm currently not subbed FYI) should be entitled to more things. Bottom line is: they pay money to Lirik. They are responsible for paying his rent/car/cellphone bill/food and whatever else he needs; his livelihood if you will. That's like going out to eat and being required to give someone half of the food you paid for because the other guy just so happened to be there.   And I'm not sure if you've watched recently, but Lirik like never takes time off. Everyone seems to forget that he didn't even start taking off Thursdays again until relatively recently. Unless RL stuff comes up, he's always on 12(ish, always late =P)pm EDT 6 days a week."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,bacje16,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"It's because people takes his jokes very serious and keep whining over little things. Do you thing its easy to deal with people like this every fucking day? While I agree that Lirik response is out of proportion and he doesn't know how to deal with those things. I understand him and others streamers for example when some retard keep asking the streamer to play their favorite game, the"" fuck off my channel""  become a common response and some people get butt hurt for the others and starts to criticize over little things and keep searching for every fucking slip and every fucking excuse to annoy them and this keeps snowballing. I'm glad that lirik doesn't suck his viewers/sub balls but somehow this makes some people more and more whining retards."

DatGuyLirik,39nu99,RagingElbaboon,7,Sat Jun 13 21:23:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but Lirik's response was on a level of a 12 year old. Yes admin was stupid, but saying go fuck yourself before quickly hanging up so he couldn't respond was the cringiest thing I saw in a while."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,Verboten247,4,Sat Jun 13 21:37:13 2015 UTC,"The admin pulled him out of the game and interrupted the stream because he committed a thought crime. He seriously deserved to get shit on for being a moron, and I hope the owner of the server banned him for ruining any publicity they could of been getting, and for that communities sake of not having a toxic admin like that around.  He's streaming to 20,000+ people, Lirik doesn't have time to spend 10 minutes trying and explain to somebody the exact reason he is a complete moron. He did the best thing he could in that situation, got the fuck out and played a new game, barely commenting on it.  I've been an admin in communities with people like that, and you could sit there and explain step by step the reasons they're a idiot, but almost always they will never understand. In that situation you just leave. You can even see that when it happened, Lirik initially tried explaining that it was a joke to the stream and he hadn't even turned around, but the admin replied with ""I know, I know but we take that stuff very seriously here"".  Could Lirik have followed up to that to explain to the admin why stream-sniping and then trying to pull him out for thought crimes in ridiculously stupid? Yes, in theory. But why waste the time, fuck him and just leave, that's not being a 12 year old it's being an entertainer trying not to bore his audience debating an idiot."
DatGuyLirik,39nu99,-l--l-,7,Sat Jun 13 22:13:45 2015 UTC,"Or, you know, he could just say ""Alright bro, I don't have time to deal with this right now, goodbye"" instead. Doesn't make you lose any more time AND you don't look like an angry teenager.  And as someone pointed out, admin probably thought that he said that in-game, which doesn't excuse him completely, but still.  As for publicity, I'd argue it's a double edged sword. Yes you get more players, but quite a few of you are retarded, plain and simple. I hope he never plays PR again to be honest, that community is great, yet since Lirik played it the other day there have been quite a few trolls and retards on the servers. It coincided with a new release though, so it MIGHT just be a coincidence."

DatGuyLirik,39g2l9,Larryx123,2,Thu Jun 11 15:15:34 2015 UTC,ty
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,pedromaga2014,60,Wed Jun 10 18:11:20 2015 UTC,The whole idea that a server can supposedly ban someone for threatening to run over someone else's fictional character blows my mind.
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Ptoastmann,25,Wed Jun 10 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"Not only that but it was not even a public threat, from an RP point of view there is no way that admin should have been able to reference what Lirik joked about with his stream."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,DougyAM,5,Thu Jun 11 05:38:56 2015 UTC,admin is probly a non sub
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,darozay,23,Thu Jun 11 07:49:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, hey, don't put us together with this trash."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,dem0nhunter,-38,Thu Jun 11 14:46:05 2015 UTC,i thought this /r was subs only ....
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,darozay,14,Thu Jun 11 15:11:25 2015 UTC,its not
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Arkwoman1990,-33,Thu Jun 11 15:39:03 2015 UTC,unsubbed to this /r
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,darozay,12,Thu Jun 11 15:45:28 2015 UTC,"Like anyone is going to miss you, this is reddit, everyone who comes on here can subscribe or talk. Idiot"
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Arkwoman1990,-12,Thu Jun 11 15:49:59 2015 UTC,its reddit 99% of comments are sarcasm .. go back to twitch chat pleb
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,darozay,8,Thu Jun 11 17:50:41 2015 UTC,Its people like you who give subs a bad name -_-
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Duckmaster64,7,Thu Jun 11 19:35:12 2015 UTC,I know. I am asking how the fuck is it even a rule what the admin was suggesting.  It's a fake threat of a fake action. Nobody is harmed.  Doesn't impact the server at all either.
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Ptoastmann,8,Wed Jun 10 20:43:43 2015 UTC,When people get authority over others (even something small like this) They tend to abuse it.
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,popx94x,78,Wed Jun 10 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"I love lirik. He's got personallity. Some of these twitch streamers are so flat, and they do their best not to offend anyone. Lirik is himself, for the most part.   I respect that."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,onemanmanywomen,31,Wed Jun 10 21:08:56 2015 UTC,This is pretty much the reason why I started watching him. He's entertaining and he's HIMSELF unlike half of the people who stream on twitch
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,PeterDinkleberg,2,Wed Jun 10 20:10:25 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely.  While I know that the guy has no idea who I am or gives a shit he just seems like somebody I'd be good friends with. There are too few of people nowadays with a fun relatable personality.
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,0b4m4,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:48:36 2015 UTC,"He's brutally honest and only plays games that he likes and has a good time playing them which is entertaining for us(the viewers) so thats why he's my favorite streamer, other than the reasons that I've already stated lol"
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,PeterDinkleberg,24,Sat Jun 13 01:52:11 2015 UTC,"I think that also carries over into how he deals with developers or PR people when he is talking about their games.  You see plenty of streamers who bend over backwards not to offend a developer etc. knowingly praising a terrible game because they got a free copy or some other ""deal"".  Meanwhile Lirik has the actual game developers or PR people in his chat and he will point out flaws all day long, think about how much he has criticized Day Z, H1Z1, Arc etc. Hell he even talks shit about twitch when needed.  Its refreshing to see someone not bothering to censor themselves out of fear of annoying developers/publishers."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,DougyAM,6,Sat Jun 13 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, developers should praise people like Lirik that actually gives a fuck and gives his honest opinion. Credit to a game when it's good but there is always some flaws and it's important to point them out for improvement."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Pedarsen,34,Thu Jun 11 05:37:43 2015 UTC,Admin wanted some 1on1 with senpei
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,GlomB,18,Thu Jun 11 08:55:11 2015 UTC,Yeah because the admin must feel inadequate as fuck. How sad is that?
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,BitBurner,6,Wed Jun 10 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's some pre-crime stuff right there. He didn't even threaten to run them over in-game, heck, he didn't even hurt anyone in-game! It's like that game/server takes place in some dystopian, dictatorial setting with thought police."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Palivizumab,3,Wed Jun 10 22:36:21 2015 UTC,"It's like thinking ""i should punch that annoying guy in the face"" but not doing it because you know better then having a cop car pull up and give you a bollocking for thinking that."

DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Duckmaster64,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:00:55 2015 UTC,I wonder how rude he might have been otherwise?
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Ijustsaidfuck,3,Thu Jun 11 12:58:04 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling he would have been much nicer had lirik muted ts, he probably felt the need to assert himself when he knew everyone was listening."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Duckmaster64,3,Thu Jun 11 01:46:32 2015 UTC,"That just reinforces how stupid he is. You don't heckle the guy with the mic, as Lirik demonstrated.  Now the entire server looks like poop because of this one retard."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Ijustsaidfuck,40,Thu Jun 11 03:46:30 2015 UTC,Why ruin the video with that stupid MLG shit. It isn't funny at all.
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Myspeld,38,Thu Jun 11 08:53:51 2015 UTC,"That admin just fucked every bit of popularity that server was getting. How stupid can you be? A live streamer with a following of 30k + viewers watching him play on YOUR server, and you call him out for making a fucking joke?  Damn, hope that admin realizes how big of a mistake that was."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,agooddaytodie,28,Thu Jun 11 19:41:09 2015 UTC,It's very likely the admin is not the server controller and just a super user. In which case the server controller is probably pretty irate with this douche he OP'd.
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,0_________o,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"Cool bro. The damage has been done, however. Maybe don't appoint low ranking mods to handle interactions with offenders, just observe and notify higher ups. Can't say much about you and your server. It sucks, but your mod salted the land for you essentially, and put a bad taste in everyone's mouth. I'm sure there was some idiot lirik-fan boy backlash in someway, which sucks for you guys, but you can't blame lirik. All he wants to do is play the game. He doesn't wanna be chased, followed, or treated any differently than anyone else. Being that you ""own"" the server, you're responsible for the actions of the people to put into power. Admins, mods, etc. If they fuck up, it reflects poorly onto you. This is how it works for most things in life with similar semantics. Good luck with everything, and stuff."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,0_________o,2,Thu Jun 11 07:40:19 2015 UTC,"Not trying to get on Lirik's dick but when Lirik plays a decent game it skyrockets in popularity, at least temporarily. Devs are willing to give him games for a reason. Getting your game played by Lirik on a day like Sub Sunday is marketing heaven (or any other day for that matter). That being said, if you piss him off on stream then it's gonna hurt your game/server-- a lot."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,lobster_liberator,6,Wed Jun 10 23:48:51 2015 UTC,my ears. He still got that admin though.

DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Cielo11,42,Sat Jun 13 02:26:43 2015 UTC,"He was getting stream sniped. He drove away from them, and said ""maybe I should run...Nah"" He said it to chat, not even in game.   Crusty Admin was watching his stream, pulls him into TS to give him a telling off.   Apparently talking to his channel viewers, about wanting to killing stream snipers in game, is rule breaking offense on that server. I agree with Lirik, go fuck yourself and your server."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,mirac_eren,-3,Thu Jun 11 00:42:31 2015 UTC,"Admin just warned him not to do it. told him the consequences and they take those cases seriously. The community over exaggerated the situation, like admin threatened him with a ban. It still wasn't necessary for admin to tell that to lirik, as he said he already know the rules of the server and as we all know he has been rping for long times, I guess what happened there was, admin thought Lirik doesn't know rules, so he stopped him and wanted to tell lirik the rules, when Lirik told that he knows the rules, he felt ashamed maybe or he was excited so he messed up. Tbh it wasn't a «rekt» situation. Lirik was fed up already and he blew up.  If admins banned the stream snipers while he was watching him he wouldn't be named stream sniping admin he might have had this intention so he would see the problems easier. Why would admins want to make liriks rp harder deliberately, he would lure lots of people if he enjoyed it on stream. I don't think admin had bad intentions so imho he didn't deserve that much of a harsh and unexpected reply"
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,ZombieShawn,13,Thu Jun 11 11:30:02 2015 UTC,ROFL! Best Lirik response EVER. Loved it. Made my day.
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,GlomB,18,Wed Jun 10 18:34:20 2015 UTC,"With no hesitation, straight from the heart, gives him no time to respond, just leaves. Sooo fucking good. Admins think they can abuse powers like that over lirik? Get fucked mate."

DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,stjunk,20,Wed Jun 10 21:24:18 2015 UTC,"Dude... You're missing the point. The admin was watching the stream, heard Lirik say something about running the stream sniper over to the people watching him stream, not in-game.   The admin is getting all this deserved hate for abusing what little power he has, a server admin and/or mod for a dying arma 2 mod. The guy is way out of bounds, and has nothing control over what Lirik does or says on his own, damn stream. Guy just acted like a major dick, and deserved what he got."
DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Santusak,-29,Thu Jun 11 00:17:29 2015 UTC,"no i fully understand that, so that is worth dedicating a hate forum and making youtube videos to this guy? ""sigh i think i should go bomb a airport"" -- ""excuse me police? why are you at my door? it was a joke and it was said in a email and not in person.. personally i think you're abusing your power by looking into my emails"" -- mod just wanted to make sure his server was played by the rules, if lirik wasn't in a bad mood and said ""yeah i'm sorry thanks for reminding me"" this entire post would be switched to a spam of ""what a nice guy emotes"" instead because the sheep follow exactly that of liriks opinion. --- i won't reply in this specific forum again due to the numbers against me won't end. i just try and view it from everyones point of view."

DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Gramercy_Riffs,14,Fri Jun 12 03:01:10 2015 UTC,"Wow... Way to make a poor comparison. I can't speak for everyone, but I found it fucking retarded that he went out of his way to ""assert his authority"" by contacting a guy playing on their server because he overheard him making a quick joke about running another player over, outside of the game chat!  Sure, this might have gotten out of hand, but the guy was a proper dick, and he should have seen this coming since there was 30k people watching. He could have been the bigger man and let it go, hell, he could even have gone after the root of the problem, and talked to the stream sniper (though we don't know if he did, I'm not gonna give him the benefit of the doubt).   And please, stop calling people ""sheep"" for agreeing with Lirik on this. It was seen by 30k, it was a funny clip, and of course people will think the admin was a bit of a dick.   Besides, I would hardly say Lirik was in a bad mood when it happened.   And please do answer, I won't down vote you for having a different opinion, and I hope no one else does either."

DatGuyLirik,39bqs0,Testnick,14,Thu Jun 11 04:15:50 2015 UTC,"I guess the hate is because what Lirik said about running the guys over was on his stream, not in the game's chat nor TS. What the admin tried to do is called censorship and who the heck is a game's admin to tell anyone what they can or cannot say outside the game? The admin overstepped the boundaries of his authority, so even if what Lirik said wasn't a joke, the admin still had no valid reason to do what he did just because he heard it on his stream."

DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,Pedarsen,29,Wed Jun 10 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"He said it last week and went back to it. So you never know.   TBH I didn't enjoy watching ARK, so i'm not fussed. But its part of watching Lirik. He doesn't play what chat wants him to play, he does what he wants and you've got to go with it, or find another channel."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,Cielo11,3,Wed Jun 10 17:20:25 2015 UTC,Totally agree!
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,DiveBarMassacre,3,Wed Jun 10 20:07:57 2015 UTC,"I dont really enjoy watching Ark either, mainly because it's so grindy. But I have subbed to watch Lirik and what ever he decides to play so I'm not complaining.   I mean he played Ark 5 hours monday and tuesday, it's just dumb that people go all ""bohoo we are majority play ark pls"" when he isn't playing it 3rd day in a row.   It also felt and sounded that Lirik was in a bad mood yesterday at the start of stream so yeah we'll see."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,winnishEnt,7,Thu Jun 11 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'm wanting to say that he was being sarcastic considering he followed that up with ""I always buckle under the few haters"""
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,Ghash1,10,Wed Jun 10 19:11:58 2015 UTC,"I think I prefer watching Ark over Rust, at least with Ark it doesn't just become stream sniper heaven within 15 minutes. Ark just needs a better system for PVP."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,shankeyx,6,Wed Jun 10 18:03:22 2015 UTC,Not really. ARK involves too much grinding and lacks the fun RP interaction and fun/rewarding PvP found in other survival games. It just isn't very entertaining to watch right now. The ARK binge sessions didn't help either.
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,Herbspiceguy,2,Wed Jun 10 17:38:48 2015 UTC,I agree. He doesnt enjoy it very much and viewers too so why push it? He will probably come back to it later like Rust.
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,ryleih,5,Thu Jun 11 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't take his ""never playing again"" arguments seriously, he literally played every single game that he said he will never play again."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,Vanquishhh,3,Wed Jun 10 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah hopefully, but still he seemed kinda upsett about it."

DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,anarkandi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:41:14 2015 UTC,Not playing ark? Apparently the haters that doesn't like seeing spesific games were really loud this time.
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,winnishEnt,3,Wed Jun 10 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I wouldn't think there would be such an uproar against Ark. I feel like people only want him to play A3L, despite the fact that he often seems bored of the game, and that he overall struggles to find good games. I haven't been watching him as much lately because he's been so noticeably bored with all the games he's played. He's fun to watch when he's having fun."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,LoveJustHate,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:55:36 2015 UTC,"It's not that people dont like watching Ark, more like people dont want to watch it 3 days in a row when he already streamed it all day monday and tuesday."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,6in,-1,Thu Jun 11 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"Lirik playing A3L is amazing to watch, IMO."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,Blahcookies,2,Thu Jun 11 03:18:34 2015 UTC,i used to love his arma streams after i watched like 3 of them... in the end its basically always the same content. But then im not gonna bitch about that in chat because if i don't want to see some games he wants to play i just do something else until he finished that game
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,Ready-Set-Dead,2,Fri Jun 12 00:42:59 2015 UTC,"For me, I'm not worried for it. Personally I didn't enjoy Ark, and I enjoyed more Rust. I actually enjoyed his Rust gameplay on stream a lot and because of that I bought the game!  I hope he plays more Rust."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,19cocaine95,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:08:42 2015 UTC,"I bought Rust because of him as well. I really did enjoy playing that game and his sub server was fun at first. It's sad seeing how quickly that game went downhill after lirik stopped playing. Maybe after the update he will play it again, he needs to find a private server that is active imo."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,stjunk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:53:27 2015 UTC,When he said it It sounded like sarcasm. I don't think he was serious
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,Slozor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"he has also said that about a3l.. rust.. miscreated? dayz.. ect ect, don't take his word seriously."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,noxlius,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:42:52 2015 UTC,"I think arc is a really good game, however the streamsniperage was so crazy that there's no point in pvp. And honestly, I did miss some action while he played arc on Moon's server."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,l0st_t0y,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:23:55 2015 UTC,i hope he will play ark in future. it was fun to watch. would love to see the end game in ark.
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,sohammey,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:37:00 2015 UTC,"He has said that about a3l, DayZ, H1Z1, Rust, and probably more games. He might not play it for a bit, but he will probably come back if there is a big patch or if he can get on a server similar to Rust where the crafting and gathering is sped up. I like watching it but just like every game its not for everyone."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,anarkandi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:12:05 2015 UTC,"Ark over Rust,DayZ and h1z1 right now"
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,TokyoFireworkz,5,Fri Jun 12 21:53:05 2015 UTC,"I always stop watching Lirik during witcher, h1z1, a3 BR. I dont complain or tell him what to play though. I just check out other streamers. :p"
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,LoveJustHate,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"I always liked A3BR. I thought it had enough action, but wasn't just CoD run n gun. Of course Lirik added his touch to make it funny. H1z1 though is tough for me to watch. Something about the mechanics or graphics. In any case, he streams for nearly 8 hours so there's nearly always something for everyone."
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,AzehDerp,0,Wed Jun 10 22:28:55 2015 UTC,H1Z1 legit just looks so clunky and codish
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,baramgood,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:09:32 2015 UTC,Yeah of course you can have that opinion. But (not saying you are) you don't have to spam this like crazy on twitter and twitch chat to make him stop. I also don't enjoy watching him play H1Z1. When he plays that i just leave the stream on so he gets the viewer and then i do something else untill he plays something i like.
DatGuyLirik,39bhyr,darozay,-1,Thu Jun 11 03:20:00 2015 UTC,Yay.
DatGuyLirik,39d231,GrilledChickenXL,5,Wed Jun 10 23:13:01 2015 UTC,"ye he did graduate. Nothing changed tho, same stream times like before now he's just an official full time streamer."
DatGuyLirik,39d231,zyxone,3,Thu Jun 11 00:38:42 2015 UTC,"he pretty much was doing it full time for over a year now, his last year in college he took his last few classes prob hybrid or online but his schedule was the same as it is now (sometimes he would skip a day because of a project or something but that happened rarely)."
DatGuyLirik,39d231,Vanquishhh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:00:36 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he does full time plus overtime doing it 6 days a week.   While not always 8 hours a day it's a good 40 hours a week.
DatGuyLirik,39d231,0b4m4,0,Sat Jun 13 02:17:27 2015 UTC,yeah but nothing will change just that he is officially doing nothing else in life now basically. but same time slots ect.

The obvious choice for me for donations would be a simple ""What a nice guy"".   Or perhaps, with his great gravelly otherworldy voice in mind for donations ""A peasant has made an offering"". For subs, ""Another soul has ascended from the non sub pit of doom and dispair"".  Hopefully others can come up with some better ones, but I'll keep thinking."
DatGuyLirik,394vlu,rcon__,19,Tue Jun 9 08:48:07 2015 UTC,"These are good ideas, but remember, Lirik gets A LOT of donations and subs so it should be something you wouldn't have trouble hearing X times during a stream and wouldn't intrude too much. I also think that Lirik, since it's his stream and all, should decide how it should be said. Should it be something happy? Sarcastic? Ironic? Dark? I mean, this is a pretty sweet opportunity and thinking about how long he's had the current sounds, we might be hearing these for a while. Excuse the rant, I just wanted to put in my thoughts!    Edit: I might be overthinking this"
DatGuyLirik,394vlu,airikewr,5,Tue Jun 9 11:32:31 2015 UTC,"You make some good points for sure. And fear not, Lirik should and will decide on what is said. He's just come here for some idea's to help get his creative juices flowing."
DatGuyLirik,394vlu,rcon__,3,Tue Jun 9 11:59:46 2015 UTC,"You're right, I just meant he should first decide if he wants it in a special way, that would make it easier to help him come up with something to say. There's so many ways of saying the same thing! :) I really like the ""What a nice guy"" idea. It's short and to the point. I'm trying to come up with something that really takes advantage of this man's fantastic voice."

(Catalan: Desperta Ferro!, IPA: [dəsˈpɛrtə ˈfɛru]; Medieval Catalan: Desperta Ferres!) was a battle cry of the Middle Ages employed by the Almogavars. It was shouted on entering the fight, to frighten the enemy and invoke the presence of iron in the battle.  Other Almogaver war-cries were Aragó, Aragó!, Via Sus! Via Sus!, Sant Jordi! Sant Jordi!. However, of these Desperta Ferro! has emerged as the most famous, as it was unique to those forces. The cry was given as the Almogàvers struck the earth with their lances and darts, causing sparks to fly up from the stones.    Image i - Desperta Ferres! Desperta!

DatGuyLirik,39c53d,ReadingNotAllowed,-6,Wed Jun 10 20:59:55 2015 UTC,"Sayeed was the biggest stream sniper before partnership... You can easily prove this by watching lirik's A3L VODs before Sayeed started streaming.   You can even watch this video that's supposed to be funny but really is pretty much a stream sniping highlights video of Sayeed: https://youtu.be/QY1Why6h55g ... even Lirik felt something sketch.. ""You're like a ghost at this point"" LOL!   Not saying that Sayeed isn't funny or a good streamer, maybe he is.. but he definitely stream sniped and used Lirik to get partnership and I don't respect him for that and will never support him."
DatGuyLirik,39c53d,davisjunior,5,Thu Jun 11 04:03:56 2015 UTC,"I actually watched Sayeeds stream just a few days after he started, and he said that he didn't even know who Lirik was before people were telling him in his chat. When he found out who Lirik was he also said that he didn't want to actively seek him out in-game because he didn't want to be annoying. He was also always trying to prevent metagaming in his channel. Of course you would know this if you had actually watched his stream."

Wasn't till I watched an old stream I realised it was Sayeed did this, it may have been same guy.   Its obvious some of A3L streamers snipe, its hard not to, I think most people would try to RP with him. Its been a little obvious recently certain police officers always follow him. Also the guy that did the Pacman song, the very first meewting with him it was obvious he was desperate for Liriks attention.  Still Sayeed, is funny and deserves the views. As long as they are good RP'ers I don't think sniping is all that bad."

If you look positively they just took opportunity that presented itself. But if you're smart, you know that to make stream successful it takes a lot of effort and dedication. It's not enough to stream snipe someone popular and start your own stream. Both Lo & Sayeed put good amount of hours into streaming and trust me it's not easy to stream 12 hours in a row like sayeed often does (trust me, I tryed). They deserve all credit they get, sure Lirik helped them, but the rest is their work, and u can't take it away."

I like being able to switch between Lo/Lirik/Sayeed and other A3L streamers perspectives. Most streamers support each others. That said Lo isn't my favourite in the streamer community. He could do more to help promote and support other streamers in return for the things they do for him. Sayeed and Timmac for example really deserve their recent succes - they've self promoted themselves by being humble, open minded, and helpful towards Lirik and other streamers. Lo hasn't really had the same success, because he doesn't have an as friendly personality."
DatGuyLirik,39c53d,assassinozockt,19,Fri Jun 12 06:10:09 2015 UTC,"Ehh, are you talking about the way I RP? That's just how the character is. Lo Chang, the character just is a dick. lol  'He could do more to help promote and support other streamers in return for the things they do for him.'  I try to host as many people from the A3L community as possible and I do quite a few shoutouts/raids. For example: I hosted Pudding/Grandma for +2 weeks because he had a huge viewer drop and I wanted to help him a bit.   Also, I've never looked for 'success'. People keep asking me 'Why are you not streaming that much when you have a sub button?' I've never intended to get a sub button and Twitch is and always will be just a hobby. It's not that I'm not thankful for the button, it's just that it still is a hobby to me and I don't see why I should force myself to play video games when I'm just not in the mood for it. I don't care about viewers, hell I wouldn't even care if I'd go down to five viewers again like in the beginning of this year. I still had fun.   People just take this shit way too serious and they actually think that I make plans to play with Lirik or some bullshit lol. I know three people who did this and that claimed that they didn't know Lirik. Funny thing is that you could hear Lirik's stream echoing in the background of one of those guys and the other guys only logged on when Lirik was around before they started streaming lol.  Because of shit like this and the monotony of A3L I just wanna drop A3L, take a break from streaming for a few months and start streaming again with a new game at point zero. Jesus."

I just said Sayeed/Timmac have a more inviting/humble approach to their viewers and are more extroverted/stronger social networkers than you, which I prefer in a streamer. I still watch your stream ocassionally and you shouldnt worry about what I think since you have alot of people out there who like your personality and stream. All viewers have a different taste in streamers and your cool vibe is alot like forsens, another popular streamer, so you have alot going for you. My personal attitude to stream sniping is that its all good as long as the sniper isnt a dick/weirdo/blatant fanboy/stalker, its good that streamers leech viewers from each others as long as they help and support each others."

DatGuyLirik,39a9ij,Kiiilerke,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:12:50 2015 UTC,"In my case there is no general rules, there are cases where the game is boring but the streamer is being hilarious, in which case I keep watching.   There are cases where I don't like the game/the game is boring and the streamer loves the game and is just playing it normally, in which case I just close the stream. If anything memorable happens people will talk about it and I can just experience it latter without having to lose hours of my life watching the rest of it.  The most recent example I can think of is Black Mesa, I personally don't care for the game, I already beat it and is not one of those that I consider to have replay value, much less in the form of watching somebody else play it, but I don't doubt that Lirik could have hilarious moments with the game so I check the highlights and the ""Finally someone who is not trying to kill me"" thing happened, almost fell of my chair laughing and that's good enough for me, I'm still not interested in watching the rest of it personally even though I'm sure most people probably enjoyed it.  There is also other ways I could let the stream on even if I don't like what is happening, for example I like Lirik, I've watched him so much that I consider him my friend in a weird onesided kind of way because he doesn't know me and probably never will so when I have nothing else to listen to at work like podcasts or I'm not particularly in the mood for music, I just listen to the stream regardless of what the hell is happening and whether or not I like the game being played.  The answer you wanted is really not as simple as personality>gameplay or gameplay>personality for most people, it all depends on context."

There's only a possibility that servers will crash, it's worth a shot, especially if it's organized properly.  For example, in GTAV he can start a crew only session and have people come in and fuck around with him. Maybe send out a sub only email on twitch that lets subs know which server he's connected to in a game then it'll be first come first served."

DatGuyLirik,392r4c,byKonzii,4,Mon Jun 8 23:38:57 2015 UTC,This is it.  Go over to the ark sub though and you will get all kinds of hate for suggesting this is a game breaking problem right now.    People make this same mistake over and over every other year:  defend a new game based on what the future holds and not on how it is right now.  Then they get burned half the time and wonder why.
DatGuyLirik,392r4c,Roez,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:46:50 2015 UTC,"Just because other's fail, doesn't mean Instinct Gaming will. Just looking at the passion of the devs, the patch rate, and the fact that they started this game July last year, means they are way faster and more efficient than the other alphas you're thinking of, and more serious."
DatGuyLirik,392r4c,anarkandi,2,Tue Jun 9 07:29:40 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why the mistake is repeated.  You don't know what the outcome will be.  In every one of those failed games people said the exact same freaking thing.  A failed game doesn't mean a company goes bankrupt either, it can simply mean they didn't reach close to expectations.  It's not that they will fail (hopefully they won't, I like the content) for sure anyway, it's that people fight tooth and nail to support a game and down play faults largely based on what might be versus what actually is."
DatGuyLirik,392r4c,Roez,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:54:03 2015 UTC,They've already reached mine. I'd play this game even if there were no more patches.
DatGuyLirik,392r4c,anarkandi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:07:09 2015 UTC,"If people didn't buy failed games there wouldn't be games?  Or, if people didn't just hand over money hoping to get a good game there wouldn't be games?  If I'm reading that right, what you said doesn't really make sense.    What's generally accepted in most consumer-producer situations is people don't buy shit products and gravitate instead toward better products, and this motivates production competitors toward continued improvement.    If you're saying investors taking a chance on a product can help promote games, that's different.  But, it's not an excuse to push unreasonable expectations on everyone else (who cares what you do with your own money), and insist promises about future development are set in stone."
DatGuyLirik,392r4c,Roez,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:25:54 2015 UTC,"I guess my post didn't really make any sense, but are you really that paranoid just because you've wasted money on some shitty games just because you didn't have the patience to watch streams or find out it isn't going to be kept updated?   How does one figure out that's a failed game now? Ark is exactly what it was in the trailer. Ark told that 60 fps on Epic wouldn't be a thing in a very long time and we knew this. So what are you expecting of them?  Nothing even defines that these games failed in any way. Many say DayZ failed, but it's still early access for fucks sake. They didn't promise you ANYTHING.  Try to lower your expectations and not buy a game and expect for the game to be exactly what you saw in the trailer."
DatGuyLirik,392r4c,ajaxwow,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:15:02 2015 UTC,"Don't confuse my complaint with me giving a shit what others like or chose to do.  I've made that clear.  The complaint is specific to over zealous fanboys (and girls) who make a sub almost worthless, fail at any objectivity about what others might think, and do stupid crap like have a voting brigade to downvote all the ""thumbs down"" votes on steam.   That type of shit isn't going to magically make a game better, improve it or keep a game going.  You know what is getting the developers to work 100+ hours a week getting performance up to speed?  A bunch of people asking for refunds and bitching about the worst graphics performance one can imagine, and insisting it get changed.  Not the fanboys.  It also sends a message to other, future developers about what a market will put up with and accept.    A game failing simply means to the individual.  False expectations can lead to the sense a game failed, and I meant it as a measure of the lack of objectivity many fanboys have later on down the line."

DatGuyLirik,38wwhf,Santusak,6,Sun Jun 7 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"Dyatlov Pass incident:       The Dyatlov Pass incident was an event that resulted in the death of nine hikers in the northern Ural Mountains on the night of February 2, 1959. The incident happened on the eastern side of Kholat Syakhl. Since then, the mountain pass where the incident occurred has been called Dyatlov Pass after the group's leader, Igor Dyatlov.  Investigators determined that the skiers had torn their tents from the inside out in order to escape from an apparent threat. They fled the campsite, some of them barefoot, under heavy snowfall. Although the bodies showed no signs of struggle, two victims had fractured skulls and broken ribs, absent contusion. Soviet authorities determined that an ""unknown compelling force"" had caused the deaths; access to the region was consequently blocked for hikers and adventurers for three years after the incident. Due to the lack of survivors, the chronology of events remains uncertain, although several theories exist, some involving a possible avalanche.

I have heard it can cost the streamer up to $20 for a chargeback, even if the original donation was only $1. Then of course we have taxes.  In short, Lirik is nowhere near your estimate.

Towelliee was liking DayZ and kept saying ""I don't play this game a lot. If you want to see someone who knows what he's doing, check out Lirik"". Puddn was the one that actually made me the most curious about Lirik's channel. He and his squad was talking about Lirik cloning beans or something and, well, I was curious.  The thing that made me almost instantly hit the follow button was his personality. His interaction with chat was top notch, he was very clear with what he said, avoided drama, and he could express his emotions very well through his voice. Those are my favorite traits of a streamer, so well, that's kinda what made me stick to his channel."
DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,Limelol,4,Sun Jun 7 00:02:09 2015 UTC,"I also found him through Towelliee, but i checked him out maybe 2 months later than you. So glad i checked him out though _^"
DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,NorwegianGhost,6,Sun Jun 7 00:39:23 2015 UTC,The first time I watched lirik was in last May. I remember watching Takistan Life mods and they were hilarious.
DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,Argvir,3,Sat Jun 6 23:37:26 2015 UTC,"My first stream of lirik's that I saw was also Takistan, it was hilarious. I thought it may just have been like a really good day or something, you know like how Lirik himself says A3L is hit or miss, but then I saw him play DayzSA and he was the same so I fell in love full homo. (Kidnapped a group of people with Actor guy, and well... The rest you can imagine.)  So yeah, I'm pretty sure I can speak for all of us when I say it was his personality that made us stick around. Obviously :p."
DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,Yomanpepsican,2,Sat Jun 6 23:54:27 2015 UTC,Takistan life was one of my favorite parts of the stream
DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,busfullofjews,5,Sun Jun 7 18:46:35 2015 UTC,I watched lirik cause people were talking a lot of trash about him at the first survivor games so I went to see what the drama was and realized chat was just salty their favorite youtuber got killed by lirik.  Never looked back since
DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,warcrime1331,5,Sat Jun 6 23:52:05 2015 UTC,"When DayZ Standalone was launched. He was topping the charts for DayZ, I had recently gotten into the whole Twitch.tv thing and he had a cool attitude towards everything mostly."

DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,DzejBee,4,Sun Jun 7 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"First time for me lirik was playing A3L. I had no idea what a life mod was. It was the funniest shit and I couldn't figure out what was going on. I thought it was just an organic encounter with random players. These two dudes were RPing kidnapping him in a cooper. Lirik did his classic double cross and stole the car. Then he felt bad and went back to pick them up. Entirely ridiculous.  It's a shame A3L had became stale. I'm waiting for the day a new life mod come along. Maybe we'll experience a new ""great escape"""
DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,pizza_burrito,3,Sun Jun 7 03:14:41 2015 UTC,Now that he's on Critical Gaming server rather than Life studios I think the RP and stuff has improved to be honest!
DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,Portrend,3,Sun Jun 7 09:48:49 2015 UTC,"First time I watched Lirik was in December 2013, he played DayZ BattleRoyale, and since then I watch basically every single day he streams. (I never played DayZ or Arma series, so I guess it's kind of interesting that I liked the stream so much)  I think what I liked about Lirik is that he didn't care what viewers like or want him to do. (I don't know)  Also, I'm from EU so streaming schedule is almost perfect for me."

He was just going about in dayz, i was just about to switch when he finds a guy behind a wall and starts the usual.  You over there, dont move! John if he moves, shot him in the face! (I had heard that was common occurence in that type of games, but damn i dont know it was just kind of impressive that it worked) makes him lay in the ground, drop his weapons and then, kills him saying. There is no John!  Aaaaah... i've been swooning ever since."

I was like ""who in the fuck would watch this game and how he has 20k viewers"".  I saw him play A3L or Takistan Life and I became intrested.

DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,projectgene,2,Sun Jun 7 20:52:33 2015 UTC,"Found him around April/May of last year through a recommendation from GoldGlove. I had seen him on the top of Twitch's directory here and there beforehand, but mostly when he was on DayZ( Which I wasn't particularly interested in at the time). I decided to see what the fuss was all about & ended up enjoying his style of play and commentary for the game. Since then he's progressed a ton from channel format for the stream and also graphics for the stream (Intro/Chat/Emotes/Notifications etc)   I always believe that every streamer (big/small) can always improve as the platform is still growing out of its infancy so there's a ton of ways to grow the stream's future."
DatGuyLirik,38ul4o,visualsights,2,Sun Jun 7 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"I already knew of Lirik from Hunger Games and DayZ videos, but started following his channel around March 2014 when I watched him play DayZ SA."

I watched about 20 of them in one day and was completely hooked so found my way to Twitch and Lirik through that.  I feel bad for some of the newer viewers who have never really seen a good Lirik DayZ stream.  It could go from buttclenching PVP (think Arma 3 Battle Royale) to hilarious role playing (think Arma 3 Life) in seconds.  Throw in some glitchy PVE to make it even funnier/ epic and it was so, so good at times.  So much nostalgia for that.   Still watch semi-regularly (yesterday was particularly good)."

Rust was obvious to come back to cause it's been updated a lot, and everyone was playing it again.  I don't see the point in complaining in the first place, they're fun games anyway, you've probably played a game that Lirik has played cause you thought it was fun, there's no shame in it."
DatGuyLirik,38us4y,aesopofspades,2,Sun Jun 7 00:37:20 2015 UTC,I actually think SUmmit was first on the back to WarZ and SUmmit is an old school WarZ player. Summit also played Trackmania a long time ago and i think Lirik's stream just reminded him of the game again.

DatGuyLirik,38r13w,Goddess_Jessica,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:58:21 2015 UTC,Yeah that's not gonna happen and it wouldn't make any sense. It would be questions that Lirik has already answered. I would imagine he gets a boost of followers when E3 is on and it's 80k to go anymore.   Honestly the Shortyy & Waffle and Lirik IRL should be something they could do someday but not something to celebrate Lirik's 1M on. It's hard to think of something that doesn't have to do with IRL stuff for 1M though. Possibility is a day of Waffle's main stream game which is Minecraft and okay fuck no that would be cringy.
DatGuyLirik,38r13w,ajaxwow,11,Sat Jun 6 11:24:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I remember one guy put up the idea of him playing with waffle at one of their places. I thought it would be cool."

DatGuyLirik,38r13w,oldage,3,Sat Jun 6 05:24:09 2015 UTC,the whole point would be to watch them interact. I imagine there's a difference between a camera overlooking a living room and a camera pointed right at your face so I doubt lirik would have problems with it.
DatGuyLirik,38r13w,Capn_C,3,Sat Jun 6 08:33:14 2015 UTC,would he do it though?   Probably not.

You wouldn't ever define a mentally challenged person as a retard. The definition of retard is ""delay or hold back in terms of progress, development, or accomplishment"". If someone makes a statement that seems stupid and was developed with what's perceived as a held back thought process, you can perfectly say that their statement was ""retarded""."

DatGuyLirik,38fv77,iReactZz,4,Thu Jun 4 01:24:56 2015 UTC,Who cares if it's basic? It's a visual representation of how the viewers dropped after lirik stopped streaming a certain game.  Are we here to analyse Lirik's exact drop in viewers and work out the standard deviation of viewers present in the time period that the OP included in the graph?

DatGuyLirik,38fv77,Calgetorix,3,Thu Jun 4 08:20:03 2015 UTC,"I mean the basic graph should always have labelled axes, especially for /r/dataisbeautiful posts. Of course there's no need to do deeper analysis of the graph, you're kinda going over the top now."

Once everyone is inputting their own sentences, it all merges together into a blob of spam. When that happens, people will understand that it's basically unreadable and then realize that the only thing they could contribute into the chat room is even more spam. As a result, things start to make less and less sense not to mention more and more copy pasterinos."

It takes some time for them to fall down so I'm sure when everyone is a higher level there will be fights over it. There are different color of sparks which means that they require an specific level to open. Don't quote me on the color and which level as I don't remember!    Then you also have the spheres which are boss fights(?) as far as I know. They need alot of hard to get supplies to be summoned. I'm not sure if there are any rewards when you kill them (I guess there are but I have never seen anyone fight one of them). People also use the spheres as where abouts they are on the map.

It's not about an imaginary divide, everyone watches him for him. Yes people can get fucked off with some non-subs, claiming they are annoying, but I can assure you there are plenty of subs who think they are exempt due to subbing.

There is no fucking way you can successfully offend the non subs because there is almost nothing you can say that will be personal to all of them.  This is just a joke, a funny joke IMO and you shouldn't take it that seriously.  Also, I love that Lirik is trying to use the word retarded less and less. It's funny to me that a few stream ago he said he grew out of saying stuff is ""gay"" at the start of college because that was immature but then he followed that statement using the word retarded to describe someone, which is pretty immature in itself. Maybe someday he will grew out of ""retarded"" too, I don't really care either way but it's nice to watch him grow as a person."
DatGuyLirik,388fvk,Short_Kings,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:41:38 2015 UTC,"I think what Lirik means is that people tend to go through an immature phase of using 'gay' not as a homophobic insult but more as a word to describe something negatively - Just how sick by definition means ill or upset but in terms of school-yard slang it means good.   Retarded is more to say how people are acting, so it's not IMO a phase thing that he'll grow out of! However, with the change to adorable, maybe it'll spur him to use more caring insults so to say!"
DatGuyLirik,388fvk,Short_Kings,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:01:16 2015 UTC,"He is using retarded to describe something negatively 100% so I don't get what your point is.

Saying one is worse than the other is also rather immature, like are you saying the feelings from the homosexual community are more important than the feelings of mentally handicapped individuals?  Bottom line is using any of those words in the way most people in online games do is immature, comparing the two is also silly as if you needed to use one of the two, you can say moron, idiot, dumbass, asshole and there are a pletora of other insults you can chose. But hey, I'm not the moral police, you or lirik or anybody can say whatever they want over the internet all I'm saying is that it would be pretty cool to see them grow out of it."

I get that maybe people want to see what he looks like, but there's plenty of footage of him out there.  So my question is and I'm legitimately curious: What does a facecam bring to the table and why do people want it?  To me, personally, it doesn't add anything beneficial to the stream and it makes the streamer a little less comfortable due to a spotlight constantly being on them.  Maybe it's just because it's early or maybe I'm just being simpleminded... idk, but again, why do people want one?"
DatGuyLirik,387si6,Limelol,5,Tue Jun 2 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say over 50% of the viewers don't care for a cam, because they either don't want one or they respect Lirik's opinion. No you are not alone.  I can't watch people play survival games or MMOs with cams, but scary games are pretty great with it not gonna lie. Just for expressions. Lirik knows how to express with his voice so it's not necessary."
DatGuyLirik,387si6,ajaxwow,2,Tue Jun 2 14:11:11 2015 UTC,"Lirik knows how to express with his voice so it's not necessary.   Yeah, I guess this sums up why I don't see the reason for Lirik to have one. Nicely put."
DatGuyLirik,387si6,Limelol,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:33:10 2015 UTC,well put. so true.
DatGuyLirik,387si6,rushad88,-1,Tue Jun 2 14:54:44 2015 UTC,"I understand where your coming from. Lirik never wanted to do a subcam in the recent years. In his podcast, he said he would like to though. This was just a idea that could apply to any broadcaster."
DatGuyLirik,387si6,MrDexterTheAwesome,0,Tue Jun 2 16:11:05 2015 UTC,"To be more sellout? I know that us subs pay to SUPPORT not to get perks. And me personally do it to support this streamer. But there is NOTHING wrong with getting a few perks for it anyway. So if he were to have a sub only cam, he wouldn't be a sell out, he would be nice enough to add one more perk to the people who enjoys and supports his entertainment and job."
DatGuyLirik,387si6,applemask00,0,Tue Jun 2 14:31:42 2015 UTC,"Well, this could be applied to any and all broadcaster. This isn't just aimed at lirik. If he does decide to do it. Maybe do it at a sub goal or something that's really rare to make it special."
DatGuyLirik,387si6,Yomanpepsican,3,Tue Jun 2 14:46:04 2015 UTC,"I've watched a lot of streams. I have found none of them that I thought were enhanced by a cam. I actually think it detracts. It's ruins the fun to see a person super imposed over the game acting sad, angry, whatever... but then you see this guy sitting in a computer chair, blank expression, sucking down an energy drink. Many streamers are pretty decent, but PAINFUL to see. (to say nothing of physical attractiveness).  Also... many people, not just gamers, do not have great facial / body reactions (acting). In the drop frames interview lirik seems really stoic as if the interview is annoying, boring, painful, and he is enduring it. Likely he is just listening but isn't putting forth the effort to ""act"", visually show his feelings.   I think most streams just have a cam because it shows they are more serious (production value), like having a mic in game. Or if their stream is better known, they want to be the face associated with it.   Probably the single biggest thing that lirik does differently then other broadcaster is he DOESN'T listen to viewers a lot. If he did what the collective ""we"" wanted, we would dismantle the channel by the weekend.   tldr; unless you are a good actor, cams distract from the game and are unflattering. People shouldn't be asking for lirik to add a cam, they should be asking other streamers the like to get rid of them."
DatGuyLirik,387si6,rushad88,2,Tue Jun 2 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"I normally think that getting a cam is a horrible idea at this stage, but you know what, imagining the non subs' reaction when all the subs are talking about the subcam in a sub only chat would be hilarious."
DatGuyLirik,387si6,Portrend,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"if a broadcaster does not want to use a cam then why would they want to use on for subs. Lirik and other streamers who dont use cams are not going to turn it on for subs, they have reasons they dont want a camera and just cause its a perk wont make them turn them on.  EDIT: not against you or your post. but i also never understood why ppl so desperately want a sub cam. like yesterday a SUB asked why you dont have a cam. if you sub to lirik i would assume you know he does not use cams and most likely never will. still ppl keep asking.  Also its more fun to Troll with !subcam on"

Nothing unique when it comes to these type of games, seen it once, seen it all.  When this game comes out of early access will prove if it's any good, as right now it's a pretty mess."
DatGuyLirik,38581j,IJudgePCBuilds,3,Mon Jun 1 23:10:04 2015 UTC,Nothing unique? You can ride a fucking DINOSAUR.   Games been out for a day and you already have working transportation methods other than foot.   DayZ has been out for 3 years and they can barely figure out how to add cars.
DatGuyLirik,38581j,740Buckeye,2,Tue Jun 2 13:36:54 2015 UTC,"So the fact that you ride a dino makes the game unique? I don't think so.  Most of everything else is copied from other games, except the enemies are dinosaurs instead of zombies/aliens/wildlife/whatever. One additional feature does not an unique game make. Every single game is unique then if we go by this criteria.   I hope survival games go out of fashion soon because it feels like that's all we're getting these days."
DatGuyLirik,38581j,bacje16,2,Tue Jun 2 14:51:41 2015 UTC,Every EA survival game
DatGuyLirik,38581j,Warhorse07,0,Wed Jun 3 19:05:47 2015 UTC,"So what game IS unique?   Arma 3? Boring tactical shooter.   H1Z1? Boring survival shooter.   Splatoon? Boring casual shooter.   ALL games are essentially the same, and YOU keep buying them."
DatGuyLirik,38581j,740Buckeye,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"Well   a) I haven't bought any of the mentioned.   b) Nobody said it's boring (evrn though Arc was pretty boring)   and  c) You're using extremes for no reason  And no, Arma and H1Z1 are not particularly unique, but are unique enough that they're instantly recognizable. Splatoon IS unique, despite your attempts to categorize it, because the primary goal is to paint and ""shooting"" is secondary and there are no similar games.  Arc on the other hand looks exactly like Rust with dinosaurs and lots of people share this opinion."
DatGuyLirik,38581j,bacje16,0,Tue Jun 2 15:50:42 2015 UTC,Splatoon is essentially a kid friendly version of any domination game mode across every shooter.   Ark has been out ONE day and people are already shitting on it. Remember when everyone threatened to basically burn DayBreak to the ground on the release of H1Z1?
DatGuyLirik,38581j,740Buckeye,2,Tue Jun 2 15:53:31 2015 UTC,Cool. But Splatoon doesn't FEEL like domination in any other game.   Arc FEELS like Rust.
DatGuyLirik,38581j,bacje16,0,Tue Jun 2 16:08:13 2015 UTC,How doesn't it feel like domination? You're attempting to capture territory from the other team.
DatGuyLirik,38581j,740Buckeye,2,Tue Jun 2 16:14:06 2015 UTC,"Because the gameplay is different enough? You're telling me when you play, say, Unreal Tournament domination and Splatoon it feels the same?"

I really don't understand people who say it's better than Rust. Almost all of the major mechanics are copied straight from Rust, and Rust does them all better.  On the plus side, the connection seems pretty stable and the VOIP is almost flawless, so they have a working foundation here.  Might be worth a buy at full release, have to see how much effort they put into the updates."
DatGuyLirik,38581j,Kurp,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:28:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have anything that really sets it apart from the genre, at least to me.

If it doesn't majorly improve (not just UI, optimization, AI), I'm pretty letdown."

DatGuyLirik,37u47c,irr4,3,Sat May 30 12:22:10 2015 UTC,You are probably better off with the Beyerdynamic DT-990 Pro. Same price and all but they are open headphones. Those generally sound better than closed headphones (like the DT-770 Pro) but will leak more sound in and out. So if you just want to use them for gaming and such in a not too noisy room I'd go with the DT-990 Pro.
DatGuyLirik,37u47c,Santosch,1 point,Sun May 31 09:08:58 2015 UTC,"I just bought a pair of the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro 32 ohms about 2 weeks ago and love them so far.  I don't know which ohms Lirik has, but they make them in 80 ohms and 250 ohms as well.  If you plan on using them for more than just music from your ipod or phone, then they suggest getting the 80 or 250 ohms but you will need an external amp with those."
DatGuyLirik,37u47c,adarker2morow,0,Mon Jun 1 15:31:36 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people need to have the same stuff lirik has, there are so many good headphones, pick something you like."

Not because I need what they have, but I know they like quality so I like to go with what they have. Before I buy I always look at reviews though, and streamers seem to actually have the funds to buy $150+ headphones, which I don't."

DatGuyLirik,37raoz,Yomanpepsican,4,Fri May 29 20:50:37 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind he also loses subs every time he plays such games for some reason, those who only watch him for a3l or something get pissy."
DatGuyLirik,37raoz,Yomanpepsican,5,Fri May 29 20:58:06 2015 UTC,at least he is doing single saturday from next week on. I like a bit of change watching the same game everyday gets boring
DatGuyLirik,37raoz,Goddess_Jessica,2,Fri May 29 21:02:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, single saturday is a great idea. Saturday and sunday make the stream fresh for old viewers while still being very entertaining to everyone else who enjoy video games. Every other day of the week can retain all the new viewers and other people who only like watching lirik play his main games."
DatGuyLirik,37raoz,Yomanpepsican,2,Fri May 29 21:10:45 2015 UTC,"Tbh, he also got over 1k subs, because the new payment options came out for twitch, you were then able to pretty much sub with everything, from bitcoin to subway cards"

Because deep down they find it offensive too,  and want to impose their ""beliefs"" on their service.   I think Twitch should move to China if they believe in censorship."

DatGuyLirik,37kz59,bacje16,8,Thu May 28 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because other games aren't full of sensless murdering."
DatGuyLirik,37kz59,Santusak,2,Thu May 28 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"I'm on Twitch's side on this one. It's too easy for kids to just click on the ""Yes, I am 18 or over"" button and view content that is WAY too graphic for them (I'm not talking about popcorn violence like Mortal Kombat, or GTA, etc, but graphic themes or heroifying mass murderers and lethal misanthropy). I'm all for games of any nature being made, freedom of artistic expression and all that, but there needs to be protection in place for games that go beyond the Mature rating.  They're being very responsible in an industry that needs to be seen as such more and more these days when games are pushing more boundaries and sparking media witch hunts at every opportunity.  The game is still gonna be there for people to play if they want to."
DatGuyLirik,37kz59,The_Rockheart,-8,Fri May 29 01:10:08 2015 UTC,thank's twitch! you people asking why? grow up and than ask yourself again!
DatGuyLirik,37l2vi,dagla,13,Thu May 28 12:24:13 2015 UTC,I think they are trying to hide the new AO ban is simply because of Hatred even though it's painfully obvious.
DatGuyLirik,37l2vi,oldage,9,Thu May 28 13:00:29 2015 UTC,what were the tweets? or did no one save them?
DatGuyLirik,37l2vi,moonylorr,3,Thu May 28 15:22:14 2015 UTC,"he just said something like ''not allowed to stream hatred, surprised and disappointed @twitch''"

DatGuyLirik,37l2vi,Solar_F,9,Thu May 28 17:09:23 2015 UTC,He said something about being surprised and disappointed and tagged @Twitch.

For the record i would like to know why Lirik deleted the tweets.  Delting tweets is always strange imo."
DatGuyLirik,37l2vi,Gankdatnoob,1 point,Sun May 31 01:42:34 2015 UTC,"I imagine it is a similar feeling as to this story I'm gonna tell.  I got a B on a math test once instead of an A because the teacher said I used a calculator to figure out 2n+1 where n= 1, 2, 3, 4.  I didn't show that 2x4 = 8 + 1 = 9 and instead just wrote n4=9.  Could I have gone to the head of the math department and caused a fit and possibly gotten things changed?  Maybe.  But would it have been worth the hassle, especially if it accomplished nothing?  Having to continue to go into that class the rest of the semester and having that tension between me and the teacher every day.  I opted to get over it, perhaps Lirik was feeling similarly with Twitch."
DatGuyLirik,37l2vi,bonedead,3,Mon Jun 1 14:23:05 2015 UTC,Its a conspiracy!! Interesting find though
DatGuyLirik,37l2vi,adarker2morow,3,Thu May 28 12:44:19 2015 UTC,"Well, to clear this up, Lirik just announced he was the one to delete the Tweets simply because it's not that big of a deal."
DatGuyLirik,37l2vi,Limelol,1 point,Fri May 29 16:14:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't jump to conclusions. He said himself that it was a dumb reaction and that this ban won't affect him at all since, well for hatred at least, he is not really interested in that sort of games."

DatGuyLirik,37l2vi,Ijustsaidfuck,-1,Fri May 29 00:55:15 2015 UTC,"One game, and one review (and sure, pointing to Polygon was not the best idea) does not make for a bad policy. ESRB website determines the rating, we take that as bible... after that, its best discretion on available evidence. People ask us for rules, we set them, then they get irked when we do. Cant win for trying sometimes.  Play the game, have fun regardless, and don't worry about broadcasting it."
DatGuyLirik,37l2vi,Mucx,1 point,Fri May 29 07:21:31 2015 UTC,"Explain to me why it makes for a good policy?  You have a mature content filter, you can put 18+ in title of your stream. Meanwhile you have all these 16 and 18+ games that are being streamed and most likely already being watched by children.  If you really want to take a stand for the sake of morality, then I'd suggest you ban a lot more games. (gta V torture scene anyone?)"

DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,Diegest,10,Wed May 27 08:18:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like A3L is superior, by far, but it might just be that it's new and that Lirik hasn't set up a stable RP routine yet. I feel like Lirik is doing bad RP atm because he's just running around carelessly betraying and insulting pretty much everyone he meets. He seems so impatient and bored with everyone and everything he doesn't really have the patience to wait for good RP moments to happen. Lo Chang's RP has also dropped considerably (he'll kill lirik/sayeed whenever he has the chance.) I wish they could stabilize and ground their characters more. Be a little smarter. :P"
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,anarkandi,2,Wed May 27 09:33:49 2015 UTC,Followup: I feel like CG turned towards the better yesterday. Things are getting more fun. :)
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,anarkandi,1 point,Thu May 28 11:21:38 2015 UTC,"Sayeed and Lo Chang were never about pure RP tbh, especially Lo Chang failRP'd dozens and dozens of times. Both of them are very triggerhappy characters in A3L who like to shoot other people. Sayeed has at least some portion of RP in his routine.  There's other characters who RP more interesting characters, e.g. Don Mario.  The reason that Lirik's A3L sessions have become sort of boring recently is that he doesn't have any concepts at all and always ends up coincidently running in the same people who directly and indirectly (e.g. through their twitch chat) are streamsniping him."

A3L turned into a gang ""realm"" where you either joined one or you just had to get bullied (get shot for any reason if one at all, they'd tax you for anything etc) see the suits who felt entitled to the entire world would RDM instantly instead of rp-ing. Ofc there were good times on A3L too but almost every streamer from A3L moved to Critical the SAME streamers that had good RP situations with Lirik.  Secondly stream snipers are on both servers since Lirik got a lot of exposure to the A3L mod. A lot of the guys Lirik interacts in A3L are stream sniping him, few of them happened to be fun, others were just kids that tried to look cool and impress Lirik. The difference was that the whitelist system on A3L was better so not every 12 kid could enter while on the other hand most of the A3L rejects could somehow enter in CG, probably the main reason was that server needed players and let anyone with a mic in.  Also saying fake lo chang, fake don mario is a bit too much. They did not invent that type or RP they are using it the same as others. In fact Lo Chang was at first a fake Bulut, Bulut himself said that he copied someone from altis life(I can't remember the server). They also add personal traits to those type of RPs.  Also the cash cab, kidnapping to make them sing (Lakeside got talent) those were used at first by tyrese to kidnap and rob people and every other guy just copied it because was fun. This is how life mods work."
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,w3sp,4,Wed May 27 08:41:02 2015 UTC,"the one playing as LO chang cousin was playing his role in A3L but in CG he copy paste the same accent/way to play, i respect original RP!  as for Don Mario there's actually someone called Don Maario doing exactly the same as the original and claiming that is the real one ''accepted by Avon"", that's kinda sad tbh... also i agree on getting inspirated by others people RP but again... NOT COPY PASTE :( but yeah, i get what you're saying"
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,Euritv,1 point,Wed May 27 08:54:07 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about ""Ching Hansen""? He's a Lo Chang clone who RDM'd a lot, glad that he got perma'd from A3L."
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,Pedarsen,5,Thu May 28 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"My experience on CG:  good content (really really good content) but the people there are really really bad as RP, about the fake Don Mario thing i don't mind anyone tbh, priests is a common thing nowdays since my ''blessing'' thing, can only be happy with that, for the rest i do my things (apart from that Don Maario that got already banned so problem solved, closed discussion) About the cops Tyrone sorry but i can't agree, had horrible experience everytime in CG and what u said for me is the opposite compared to A3L.  Also i think diegest asked to viewers, also my opinion is as a Sayeed /LO chang / Lirik Viewer right now  Cheers"
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,PGpanda,5,Wed May 27 09:33:05 2015 UTC,"I like Critical better right now. A3L had gone stale because of fewer ""original"" RP characters. With Critical there is some new life. I don't think this will last forever but at least for now it's better.  I agree that there is less RP on Critical, but i think there is enough to make it work. They could be a bit better but i think it's ok now. I miss Asylum and this is more like Asylum's RP."
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,Larryx123,4,Wed May 27 08:44:12 2015 UTC,Its refreshing to see any life mod thats not A3L.
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,iReactZz,10,Wed May 27 22:35:54 2015 UTC,"Let me Clarify few points u mention.  You are totally right about development and RP, More hardcore role-play is definitely in A3L, its enforced by hardcore rules and people get banned for everything. Apart from that, CG is better at everything else. Better Admins, better players, better developers, more shit to do.  Everybody is fake in life mods, I'm from Poland and RP as a African American, doesn't mean I'm real, and it doesn't mean other people that RP's like me are fakes too. If you go with this logic, I would be a fake of Jamal from Altis life, and Sayeed would be a fake of me. Sure we all watch Liriks streams but there are limited persona u can do.  Cops are way better on CG, they can have a joke, laugh etc. Cops at A3L are tryhards that failed their dream of being a real cop and are PJSalty every time at you.  CG has different rules than A3L, u can steal a weapon from dead body, there is no problem with that. Metagaming and Streamsnipers will happen everywhere Lirik goes, that's just the way it is. If Lirik is annoyed by somebody he will msg me and I'll make sure this guy in PERM'd on CG.  And also, people who don't know, people behind the A3L are the biggest scumbags on internet. Everybody moved on from there cuz of that, Ask Timmac, Pydrex or other broadcasters.  Sorry for long post :)"

DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,Callum-Hemsley,2,Wed May 27 09:39:08 2015 UTC,"A3l is ahead by far, it makes perfect sense to me.  You think 50 people are on that shout box?  If critical won, then you might have had a point."

DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,Mukoro,3,Sun May 31 18:38:35 2015 UTC,"This. Critical is just better, and the only thing they need to improve on is RP for cops and civs. And this is gonna happen."
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,Larryx123,3,Wed May 27 10:12:04 2015 UTC,Tim is biased because of what happened with him and the origional a3l a while ago. Right now the entire a3l development team is focused on making an entirely new map than expanding on the new one.
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,w3sp,2,Wed May 27 18:05:29 2015 UTC,I hope I'm not too late in asking but; what was the drama that unfolded a bit ago with A3l which caused most of its members to leave to CG?
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,IJudgePCBuilds,0,Wed May 27 20:17:55 2015 UTC,"There was a guy, who came to our channel on TS and called our Gay friends faggot's couple times and all around bad words, we had it all recorded and 5 Admins signed on perm banning this guy. But Caiden unbanned him cuz he was a big donator and told us to fuck off if we don't like it. That was like the final insult, there was many before that."
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,ajaxwow,3,Thu May 28 08:11:51 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree on certain things there.  It's true that CG is better in terms of FPS and features, but that's all about it already.   Better players: I believe that's a joke, right? All the good RP'ers are mainly playing A3L while the others and those who got banned play on CG nowadays. Any time I watch a CG stream, no matter which, there's RDM and VDM going on...and it's ridiculous. Better developers: See above. More shit to do: See above Everybody is fake in life mods: Well, that's what you get when you play a Life RPG mod. I'm also not a 84 year old Grandpa irl, who would have guessed :) Better cops: That's bs honestly. In A3L I got off lots of random things by good RP. Everytime I see Sayeed being restrained by cops in CG they don't even argue with him but just powergame everything, it's retarded. Better admins: that's your subjective opinion...are you an admin on CG yourself? I haven't had any major problems with A3L stuff at all yet. If you're an admin or sth, send me a PM."
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,make_it_reign,0,Thu May 28 18:00:22 2015 UTC,"I'll disagree with you there Tyrese. The admins are terrible at CG, depending on the situation and if they are friends with the person in trouble you are screwed regardless (which can be said for any RP community - I've been in most of them). Other than adding a casino and more options for clothes CG isn't that different.  Each server, whether A3L or CG cater to a specific audience. Do you want to roleplay hardcore? A3L. Do you want to roleplay, but want leeway and more gunplay? CG. Each server caters to their own thing. Just because you got banned from A3L or didn't have fun doesn't mean they are  bad. It's a roleplay mod, depending on the server owners they can choose how strict they want it to be enforced.  The fact that you can get people ""permd"" because you know someone on CG (whether that is true or not) is ridiculous - and I've seen this happen to other members where they are friends with admins and get banned. CG has its own issues. Everybody moved on because of the issues that A3L had when the whole Caiden fiasco took place. So they moved on to the next thing while it was down. And whatever issue arose with Caiden and your party, was not the only reason for everything occurring, you are acting like the world revolves around you.  You are heavily favouring one server and not offering an unbiased opinion because you are more liked (and apparently know the admins) on CG than you were on A3L."
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,0b4m4,2,Sun May 31 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"I guess you could say it's better RP, but it's always the same RP. Sure, CG can get repeatitive one day too, but A3L is just one little circle rping atm in my opinion.  Had a lot of fun watching CG since it was something refreshing, didn't seem to have as many obvious streamstalkers either. No drama. So much more content and RP elements like well gambling, motorcycles, whatever.  If both manage to keep their servers full, then Lirik can always decide which one he wants to play which is even better."
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,Larryx123,2,Wed May 27 10:24:02 2015 UTC,After today's stream the choice is easy: CG is better at the moment.
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,IJudgePCBuilds,0,Wed May 27 23:22:09 2015 UTC,"i give you that, yesterday was really fun apart from cops being random as always !"
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,Callum-Hemsley,1 point,Thu May 28 08:49:15 2015 UTC,I am coming around to the critical gaming server.   I am getting laughs from the situations but my suspension of disbelief for my imagination to try and picture this as a real world is harder to believe.   A lot of shit is random and chaotic and RP can be poor at times.   A3L kind of felt like there were higher stakes with them being so strict and professional in a sense.   Lirik stealing a cop car in a3l was a big deal and a highlight where in CG it was just like hahalookatme.   I also dislike the UI/HUD in critical but that will just take some getting used to.   With some better staffing and moderation I believe that CG can be a great fun server for lirik to play on.
DatGuyLirik,37fq3z,Daiuki,4,Wed May 27 13:20:39 2015 UTC,"bro, r u serious? A3L stole that shit from all around Armaholic and mod creators to the point that Tonic the Altis Life creator stopped deving. Pretty sure CG has permissions on all mods they use apart from stuff that A3L developed (which is not much)."

DatGuyLirik,3741oo,Fridom,15,Mon May 25 09:45:19 2015 UTC,"Dear Lirik,  if you read this, please try to sit very relaxed in your chair and try to imagine the following.  You come home after a Very long and hard day at work. You are sweaty and exhausted, not even enough Energy left to play video-games. So you decide to watch another person play video-games for your entertainment. Nice! Your favourite streamer is online. He's an obese little shit without friends, but everybody loves him.  When this particularly obese and entertaining streamer plays games, it's an adventure. It's like you are with him in a world, every time a different one. These story driven singleplayer games make you feel like watching a movie. Now imagine you go to the theater and  1hour into the most epic movie you've ever seen, you get pulled out of your seat and you can't ever finish the movie. Ever.  This is how it feels when you never play one of these games again. Lirik, please. Dedicate a day to all those unfinished adventures and BREAK THE CURSE.   We love you."
DatGuyLirik,3741oo,Herbspiceguy,5,Mon May 25 03:31:36 2015 UTC,"Also, in order to not burn out too quickly, you could do it as a bi-weekly thing. And don't forget, it's supposed to be fun. If it feels too much like work (even though it technically is), just quit the game, or the whole thing. I'd much rather watch a happy streamer play what he wants, than watching an unhappy streamer playing what I want."
DatGuyLirik,3741oo,Pedarsen,4,Mon May 25 13:46:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is a good idea.  If he really wanted to play and finish those games he would already have. Doesn't that make sense?  I get the impression that he only mentioned it because chat simply can't shut up about that same old list of games that they think Lirik must get back to. You can hear in his voice that he's not really sure about this. Maybe some people just need to let go of this obsession that Lirik needs to finish games.  I say let Lirik play whatever he feels like singleplayer or multiplayer, not to satisfy a vocal minority of subs. That will make for the most entertaining streams."
DatGuyLirik,3741oo,GeTwIrEd-,1 point,Mon May 25 08:43:16 2015 UTC,"I think he wants to play those games, but it's hard to finish them because the good ones take a lot of time of the regular multiplayer games. If he then gives it a day a week for it then everyone can expect it and don't be dissapointed when he doesn't play the regular games.  He might say that he just plays what he want but he also thinks about the viewers a lot."
DatGuyLirik,3741oo,teabagZz,2,Mon May 25 16:58:57 2015 UTC,"Could be fun, but I doubt he will since he finds it awkward to not talk that much."

DatGuyLirik,3741oo,SmackDE,1 point,Mon May 25 12:08:14 2015 UTC,"Damn, that would be awesome - hope he sticks to it. I just hope people end up being chill about it. I've seen some dudes rage over lirik making mistakes in a game, or taking too much time to do something. It must be annoying for a broadcaster to read such stuff, and perhaps one of the reasons he's reluctant to play single player games.   So maybe just try it out for few weeks and see how it goes. Sounds like a good idea in theory."

DatGuyLirik,373n1c,lobster_liberator,5,Sun May 24 16:29:13 2015 UTC,I still think that my game was the best choice
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,drewson87,1 point,Sun May 24 16:48:52 2015 UTC,Personally I think my game was game of the year and your game was bad.
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,w-man,10,Sun May 24 17:19:59 2015 UTC,Why do people pick long RPGs like Fallout for Sub Sunday? Do you really want to watch him spend half the hour doing character creation and then the other half of the hour doing a tutorial or intro scene? There will be 1 minute of actual gameplay in this Fallout session.
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,l0st_t0y,10,Sun May 24 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"Why do people pick games like ""X"" for Sub Sunday?"
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,lampa_cz,17,Sun May 24 22:55:05 2015 UTC,Probably because it makes Lirik finally try out a game that a lot of the stream has been wanting him to for a long time. Now he knows he actually likes the game. He may not ever play it but at least there is a better chance he will play it on a normal stream in the future.
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,l0st_t0y,6,Sun May 24 16:47:36 2015 UTC,"There is no chance he will play it, you know that."
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,BecsFTW,3,Sun May 24 21:35:48 2015 UTC,"I know its a slim chance, but he did seem genuinely interested in it. At the very least it will get him more hyped for a new Fallout (assuming one is being worked on)."
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,740Buckeye,2,Sun May 24 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"shhhh, shhhhh it's okay. They character creation only took about 2 minutes anyway, and most games usually have intro scenes and tutorials to go through. Now breathe and say: it's all going to be okay!  MOTHERFUCKING FALLOUT BABY!!!!"
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,drewson87,2,Mon May 25 05:17:47 2015 UTC,Why do people bitch about what Lirik plays?   You're probably still fucking watching anyway.
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,740Buckeye,3,Mon May 25 05:24:57 2015 UTC,I'm not bitching about what he's playing on his own time. I'm bitching about what people picked. Do you see the name Lirik in that post? Someone who voted for Fallout 3 has probably already played Fallout 3. Why do they want to watch the intro hour over again?
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,bacje16,5,Sun May 24 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"Why not? Why did people vote for fucking A3L?   They vote for games that they think Lirik will enjoy, or they think he'll hate so fucking much that he'll rage at them."
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,lobster_liberator,4,Sun May 24 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. It's an awful Sub Sunday game, because if he hadn't stretched it into 2 hours, he'd just about get out of the vault before switching games. You need to take time for Fallout or he'd have to do the tutorial before playing on stream for an hour."
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,hunterkiller001,3,Sun May 24 16:54:20 2015 UTC,I think out of all the games today I probably had the most fun watching him play Fallout 3. Some of those games were kinda dreadful IMO.

DatGuyLirik,373n1c,rushad88,2,Sun May 24 16:14:21 2015 UTC,"Only 2 games in, but this is amazing so far."
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,MrZappa8,4,Sun May 24 16:34:46 2015 UTC,I dont understand you guys. What were you expecting playing a game like Fallout for an hour. How can you get involved in it. Its a horrible game for Sub Sunday. And you all wanting him to play it so desperately prob ruined it for him anyway.
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,SirNugget,12,Sun May 24 18:41:12 2015 UTC,Why? He really liked it and he said he wanted to play more with graphic mods
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,MrZappa8,6,Sun May 24 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"That doesn't mean anything, Lirik says that about a lot of games that he never plays again."
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,rushad88,1 point,Sun May 24 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"Sure it doesn't. But he did enjoy it and that's all that matters! With (hopefully) a single player day coming up, the chances are high he will play it again though."
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,Tuxiak,2,Sun May 24 18:58:14 2015 UTC,Let's hope so. I'm sure if he got into it he would enjoy it. But let's see what happens.
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,rushad88,3,Mon May 25 04:29:22 2015 UTC,Propably because he would never play it if it weren't for sub sunday.
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,Rijonkulous,2,Mon May 25 07:18:12 2015 UTC,Well we know he would never play it. If it was not for sub Sunday. No chance. So many new games why go back 10 years for a game.
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,rushad88,1 point,Sun May 24 21:49:34 2015 UTC,why go back 10 years for a game   Mods make it less dated and content and gameplay wise its a lot better than most of the crap released nowadays.
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,Dr-GimpfeN,1 point,Sun May 24 22:23:19 2015 UTC,That is true. Well looks like he wants to play and finish more SP games now either on Fridays or Saturdays. That should be fun.
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,Cynis001,3,Sun May 24 22:47:33 2015 UTC,Kill the Bad Guy is a great game.  i dunno why he was bitching about it from second one. he didnt even want to think about how to play it

DatGuyLirik,373n1c,Arkwoman1990,2,Sun May 24 20:58:43 2015 UTC,Actually I take that back. Lirik isn't the kind of person to play fallout if he's just gonna go around killing everything
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,GeTwIrEd-,5,Sun May 24 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"theres nothing wrong with that, it's his play style, i rather go around killing things than do missions. Its what i did in all the GTA games"
DatGuyLirik,373n1c,GeTwIrEd-,0,Mon May 25 00:32:30 2015 UTC,Yeah he seems to enjoy it. Wondering how the hell he knows how to do shit in that game. If it was me I wouldn't know what to do

It stuck and never changed.  That's the actual reason, it's not a sentence or anything. Just his sub emotes in the old format. You could probably go back in VODs to see it in chat."

DatGuyLirik,36vaib,krikit_,4,Mon May 25 09:04:20 2015 UTC,I'm very good at sensing when a Youtuber or streamer is driven by money more than passion (which is why I watch so few nowadays). I have never gotten the sense that Lirik does what he does purely for the financial gain which is why I'm perfectly fine with him making as much as he does. In fact I'm happy for him.
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,Mirrror,9,Mon May 25 13:20:17 2015 UTC,Ya'll need to stop obsessing over how much people make.  How about working on your own situations instead?  Would be more productive.
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,Geersart,14,Sun May 24 13:57:28 2015 UTC,"You have to understand that the reason people might be interested in what streamers make is because it's such a new niche thing. Money is what controls our lives. The income of streamers is a way to validate the whole profession. It often changes people's  opinions on streamers when they hear about their income from ""nerds throwing their life away playing video games"" to ""wow, these are actually successful people."" I get that people might not like to discuss others income, but it's not so much about what Lirik as an individual makes, it's more about what a top streamer makes.   How about working on your own situations instead? Would be more productive.   Really?"
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,swirreftw,-5,Sat May 23 10:51:03 2015 UTC,"There's a vast difference in comparing salaries of different jobs, looking at statistics comparing them and using that information to validate or begin a journey toward a profession, to obsessing over how much a certain streamer makes.  If the discussions about money expanded to average wages of all professional streamers, how long it takes to get to that point, etc. It would be understandable but would also belong in /r/Twitch.  But the discussions happening here are ""where does he live"", ""we pay for liriks life why's he so mean"", ""so rich, stop donating"", ""I'm depressed because I only make ____$""  This isn't about validating a job type.  It's people obsessing needlessly.  lets be honest here, how will knowing how much he makes or where he lives, help you?  Really.  When I said people should work on their own situations that's exactly what I meant.  Lirik didn't get to where he is by sitting on forums being negative or speculative.  He's been working his ass off every day for 3 years.  The sooner people start the sooner they'll realize that's the only way to get where they want to be.  And before people start throwing in that stupid argument ""Sitting playing video games for 8 hours is hard work?""  Yes, doing anything consistently all day every day and making growth is hard work, mother fuckers."
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,Geersart,2,Sat May 23 15:24:45 2015 UTC,"Even though I think most of the comments in this thread aren't serioius, I agree with you on that 100%. I saw for example in one of his latest tweets about one of his friends getting engaged which made him feel old and someone replied something like:  ""you're making mad bank tho"" and Lirik said that has nothing to do with money. Stuff like that I hate and I can understand that it has to be frustrating for the streamer as well, when people are trying to make everything about money. What I was talking about in my comment was just general speculation, which I can understand and condone, but when it becomes less of that and more of what you said then it's not something I condone. Lirik is probably more of a target of this because this is such a new thing, and there aren't many others like him. That might make it seem like people are more interested in what he makes as an individual rather than what a top streamer makes.   Streaming is hard work. I can never imagine it being easy running a community, let alone while also streaming 8h+/day. Lirik deserves to be where he is, and hopefully even reach farther.   While we do agree on that, I still don't think that people's own situation has anything to do with just discussing other people's income or whatnot, it's a whole other thing."
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,swirreftw,3,Sat May 23 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"People are free to discuss whatever but there is a fine line between general discussion and active abuse.  One thing people don't seem to realize (or maybe they don't care) is that discussing someones personal information, whether it be income, location, etc is rude and invasive.  Especially when it's something that he has expressly said wants to remain private.    And you don't think that streaming every day takes quite a lot of effort?  If so you must be fairly naive."
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,Geersart,5,Sun May 24 11:22:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, but to be fair, Lirik has made his income very public to begin with.

I'm not saying it's not rude, but I wouldn't call discussing his salary ''invasive''."

You care so much about other people spending money, why not donate to a charity yourself? Lirik saying that only answered to your own question/complaint."
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,ajaxwow,3,Wed Jun 10 16:44:05 2015 UTC,"You do realize that you can say that for every single person that is getting paid above what's absolutely necessary for living right? All CEOs, managers, football players what have you could live on a whole lot less. But why would they? They have a certain skillset and they know how to use it and people are willing to pay for it. It's the same here, who are you to decide how much is enough and who people give their money to? It would be nice if they gave it to charity too, yes, but it's not your place to tell them they shouldn't give money to Lirik, even though they love what he does and he entertains them every day, because he ""has enough"".  You can do with your money whatever you want but so can everyone else."
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,bacje16,3,Sat May 23 09:44:50 2015 UTC,"You presumably bought your computer and are paying for internet access and electricity etc.  Do you realize that to some people that is a luxury that you could easily have done without and instead could have donated that money to charity? To them you are no better than the people you are criticizing for choosing to send Lirik money.   I donated to better charities. Yogscast does a great charity stream a whole month and thanks everyone for their donation. You can look it up.   Yogscast do it for one month a year and between the 12+ of them they individually put little time into it when compared to Lirik who streams 6 days a week for roughly 8 hours a day throughout the entire year.  They also derive their income from other sources, namely their youtube income and the money they get from games companies for marketing their games. To them a stream is just a nice publicity stunt. To Lirik his stream is literally his day to day job.    Basically, stop telling people how to spend their money. It is the single most obnoxious thing a person can do when discussing charity and income."

DatGuyLirik,36vaib,redditor401,21,Sat May 23 04:03:49 2015 UTC,"After taxes Lirik does not make close to $500,000 off of subs - even with 10,000 subs, which I don't think he has anymore, I think he went under.   He makes roughly $250,000-$300,000 (based on a 10,000 sub figure + and a 60/40 split) from subs after taxes, and with donations (which is a large variable) that can go up to $350,000 and higher easily. This is all speculation and approximation based on my time watching him and his split which is not 90/10 as n0thing mentioned, some have said he makes 60/40, which is more believable. Surprisingly Lirik doesn't make as much from donations as Summit or Sodapoppin does. I've been paying closer attention to his daily intake of donations, and other than the small deviations, such as coobah donating $500, he makes his donations primarily between 12pm and 4pm, afterwards his donations drop off to near nothing. His donations can amount from anywhere from $300 (on a bad day) to $1000+ (on a great day). That's why Sodapoppin and Summit are able to be on par with Lirik in income, because they have donators that splurge more.  I know Lirik doesn't like people prying on how much he makes, but I was bored and am in between jobs, and I was curious how much these streamers make and I wanted to give people perspective. But understand this, beyond the few top streamers, this is no where close to what people would normally make such as Dansgaming, MANvsGAME, LethalFrag, etc. Lirik is an anomaly, as he rode the wave of DayZ mod to the top, one of the few gamers that was there early, has a good personality, is interactive and is consistent. Lirik's consistency and program (i.e. you know he will always be playing h1z1, a3l, nightstream) when it comes to streaming compared to others is probably what brought him so far. To touch upon his program schedule further, people love consistency right? Viewers like that Lirik not only plays good games (and new releases as well), they also like to know roughly what he will be playing and when (think late night TV show lineup). H1Z1 in the ""morning"", A3L in the ""afternoon"", Nightstream at ""night"". I don't know if Lirik is aware of how smart the setup which he has created, intentionally or inadvertently, but hats off to him.  To add my own personal take on what I like about him that many people don't care for, are not interested in, or is overlooked, is his very forward take on things. He will not shy away from calling a game shit, he even called Halo garbage when Phil Spencer (Head of Xbox Division) was watching him, which is unheard of. People at the top easily take money and not care, but what's impressive is Lirik's restraint from taking large sums of cash to promote certain games, which I'm sure he is getting as he mentioned on JP's podcast (?) he gets AT LEAST 1 legitimate offer a day.  Just a last note, just remember the numbers I gave you are estimations based on basic knowledge of what we know, the 50/50 split streamers get, my personal study of his monthly donations, etc. I could be off by $1 or $50,000. Just be aware of that."
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,IJudgePCBuilds,6,Sat May 23 13:43:16 2015 UTC,"After taxes Lirik does not make close to $500,000 off of subs   Of course he doesn't make that after taxes, but typically when you talk about someone's earnings, you talk about pre-tax income. Lirik fluctuates between 9600-10000 subs a month, which at an 80 split is 38,400 - 40,000 x 12  = 460,800 - 480,000, which is very close to 500,000. Add in an additional 240k a year in donations and their figures are very reasonable, if not low."
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,GrandmasChicken,2,Sat May 23 15:50:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you roughly on his sub count. As to the split we come at a disagreement. I really doubt any company would accept an 80/20 split, especially when it comes to it being the only popular service. People who have gone elsewhere have lost 70%+ of their viewer base (i.e. Destiny, CLG, etc.) You are assuming a large split, but there were rumors that Lirik's gets 60/40, while regular streamers get a 50/50 split.  And of course it may seem like a lot, but in the end of the day, the tax bracket he is in makes his actual intake seem a bit more normal you know? Whereas before it seems like he is a millionaire not so much anymore. As for donations that is probably the largest variable, as I have stated, as that fluctuates based on numerous factors, the 240k you are looking at is definitely on the high end of things, but could be a possibility, before taxes of course - don't forget that the donation program many streamers use takes a % and so does Paypal, and we all know how greedy paypal is."
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,IJudgePCBuilds,2,Sat May 23 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity I once counted donations on a slow day in the last hour of the stream (usually the slowest time for donations). I think that he pulled in about 60$. And when I say slow, I mean slow - tips every three minutes (seems fast but try measuring time between then, it's usually 2 per minute) and most of them 3$. If you multiply that by 7 hours of streaming and say 25 days per month of streaming, you get 10500$ per month/120k per year. And that's on the very low side. If you count that a lot of people chip in with more than 3$ and that he gets more donations on average at the start and during the stream, it rises significantly. I'd argue he's pulling close to sub-button earnings with donations, effectively doubling it. That's raw though, I don't know what percentage stream tip takes, but I heard it's in low single digits.  Also, let me reiterate, I'm NOT jealous of Lirik and I totally think he deserves it, not to mention all money is given to him voluntary by viewers anyway, so I don't have the slightest problem with how much he makes and how he makes it. I'm just interested in economics and such, I research and calculate similar stuff about lots of businesses, not just streaming or specifically Lirik."
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,bacje16,1 point,Sat May 23 09:35:36 2015 UTC,"Donations are a hard to determine concretly. I/You could be off by $1 or $50,000. It really depends on who is donating and on what day. I've noticed usually Friday, and Sunday are the slowest days of donations (Sunday also being a slow sub day as well), of course this could mean jack shit if people just feel like donating. He could be earning one month on par with sub-button earnings, and the next could be half of that. It's hard to get concrete numbers unless Lirik supplies them personally, which he won't for obvious reasons. All we can do is speculate, but I can see where you are coming from as well. I think personally, that the donations Lirik gets is not only a smaller portion compared to subs, he is also missing out on a potential donator ""market"", the same people that watch Summit or Sodapoppin. Not until recently when Lirik added the top donation of the day graphic, which he did quietly, were high donations coming in at the frequency as it is now - you can bet Coobah will be donating at least a large sum once per week - which was smart of Lirik business wise. Of course the donation per month you listed does not take into account the stream tip program fee, the paypal fee, and finally taxes. After all of that it doesn't amount to as much as we would like to think.  No one thinks you are jealous by the way. Twitch is a new ""job"" market, since streaming is not really a job as one would normally define it, he is more like a busker. Lirik and a few other top streamers were smart to capitalize on something that no knew would take off as it did, and it has paid off, it is only natural that we are curious of the earning potential of being a streamer. I'd be curious about solid research, literally someone counts all donations/subs in a month, just to get a more concrete perspective, as what we are doing is not substantiated since there is no research besides our oral interpretation of events.

DatGuyLirik,36vaib,stefan1338,10,Fri May 22 17:08:15 2015 UTC,I don't think someone with 10k subs should live at his parents place...
DatGuyLirik,36vaib,kamumu,5,Fri May 22 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"Lirik easily makes 50k/Month(before taxes) from twitch. Then maybe he has other sponsorships on the side where he makes money from. Then we have his shirts which he sold A LOT of, so there's a big chunk of money. Bottom line is, Lirik makes a very good living from Twitch. And him being super defensive about it just makes it more obvious."

DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Euradys,17,Fri May 22 16:25:46 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I feel like lirik loses interest too quick. This happens in almost every new game, he will play just for 2 days.  I agree with him sometimes when he says ""X game was not a good game to play on stream"", but there are games which Lirik actually likes and enjoy streaming, but he will just stop playing after the second day, unfortunately..."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,deluhi,10,Fri May 22 22:33:44 2015 UTC,"I don't get why he either rushes games like crazy or simply gives up on them just to return to his usual games. A LOT of people (including myself) enjoy watching Lirik play entirely new games, and discover new things (that's why I absolutely adore Sub Sunday). Is he just afraid of losing his A3L/H1Z1 viewers if he doesn't play those games for a certain amount of time everyday ?"
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Tazeredfrog,8,Fri May 22 22:38:08 2015 UTC,"Not at all. Lirik is pretty much the same as me in terms of gaming. I lose interest very quickly, and always return to my main games. It's not that I didn't enjoy the games, because I did, but I couldn't be bothered to open them up again. Be it apathy, indecision, gamers ADHD, or just plain lack of interest. If I'm not 'feelin it' or I'm unmotivated, I'm not going to force myself to play something I won't enjoy."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,bacje16,2,Sat May 23 03:15:04 2015 UTC,Multiplayer kid. Lots of people are like that.
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Holymormor,44,Sat May 23 13:27:17 2015 UTC,I think Lirik did the right decision because I didn't watch the stream because I wanted to play the game my self. And IMO don't find liriks RPG gameplay is not as entertaining as the usual games that he streams.
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,zergling212,32,Fri May 22 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"I find Lirik playing story driven games to be extremely entertaining. It's a breath of fresh air after watching games full of Stream Snipers screaming like retards and asking chat to spam Kappa. I'm really sad he won't stream The Witcher 3 anymore, I enjoyed every second of his playthrough."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,yokai134,9,Fri May 22 16:38:30 2015 UTC,I hate watching Lirik play any game with a lot of options. He misses so much stuff.
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,ajaxwow,4,Fri May 22 18:19:09 2015 UTC,like Black Mesa. Wanted to see him play and beat it but it'll never happen :(
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Padalanbg,1 point,Fri May 22 19:56:52 2015 UTC,Lirik plays RPG's differently on stream as he would by himself. He most likely played them by himself before he became big.  On stream it's like everyone rushing you through the story and the other half of the chat wants you to do every little side quest.
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,JesusFChristMan,-9,Sat May 23 10:12:51 2015 UTC,When most of you will realise that watching someone else live thier lives to the fulles rather we live our own is an addiction.Shut the fuking stream and play the game yourself
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Padalanbg,12,Fri May 22 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"Well, pay me a fucking gaming rig that that can play the game.  Till then, stop your self-centered bullshit. Not everyone has the money for that. Rent, food, car, grad school. Shit is expensive when you don't have mommy and daddy paying for your 970s.  Often, streamers is the only way some of us get to experience a game."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,nissen1502,-19,Fri May 22 19:51:14 2015 UTC,u crazy dude i live in one of the poorest eastern countries where an average wage a month is 300 euro.I gathered money for 7 months + scholarship 25 euro a month to buy my gtx 660 (11 grade back then) and now i have shitty 150 euro amd 4ghz cpu and i run Withcer 3 on high with 25-35 fps. Fuck your 970 my rig cost me around 500-600 euro MAX that was 3 years ago so STFU
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,SnuggleMonster15,2,Fri May 22 20:27:09 2015 UTC,That sounds like an awful amount of work for a mediocre gaming pc. Why don't you just let them enjoy the stream? They havent been rude to you.
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Evasii0n,3,Sat May 23 12:04:20 2015 UTC,I agree.  That's why I'll be skipping his streams when he does Arkham Knight.  I've been looking forward to that for a long time and don't want to be spoiled.  That's the downside to streaming AAA solo campaigns.
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,anarkandi,2,Fri May 22 23:28:13 2015 UTC,Yeah same didn't want any spoilers
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Yomanpepsican,2,Fri May 22 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"I stopped watching his stream during Witcher3, I enjoy watching people stream some RPGs, preferably minimum-dialogue RPGs with beautiful worlds that revolve more around puzzles. But not hack-and-slash - gear - quest RPGs. Those who complain: Be happy he showed you an introduction to witcher 3 and buy the game, or watch someone else play it."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Edentrail,1 point,Sat May 23 08:00:35 2015 UTC,"I stopped watching right after he killed the griffin, before lirik's stream, I was not that hyped for witcher 3 strangely enough. But after seeing it in action, I couldn't help wanting to play it myself. Thx lirik, my wallet says fuck you."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,BodyDoubles,38,Sat May 23 12:54:00 2015 UTC,"""SO MUCH HYPE WITCHER PLS COME"" -> ""Well, I don't have time to play W3... A3L, agar.io, some other bs..."" Lirik please don't hype the game if you won't play it."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,DanjaCSGO,-7,Fri May 22 20:45:21 2015 UTC,"I know right. That's why I won't trust Lirik anymore. Same thing happened to one of my favorite games of all time, Bayonetta 2. It was even worse, he only played it for 20 minutes (it was during a 24h stream and he was grumpy as hell) and chat spammed lirikTRASH and lirikREKT, he barely got past the tutorial and said ""fuck that game"". Funny thing is, he put up with an atrocious unfinished RPG (for like, 1h30/2h) right before. I still remember how mad I was that day. I was waiting for Lirik to play and enjoy Bayonetta 2 as much as I enjoyed playing it myself, but my dreams were crushed. Don't get me wrong, Lirik is a great entertainer, but he has his flows too."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,dangoth,18,Fri May 22 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"""I still remember how mad I was that day.""  How sad. The guys just plays video games for a living and you let something that small dictate your feelings for the day? Some of you take his stream WAY too serious. I hate to say this but, it's time for you to get a life."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,dangoth,5,Sat May 23 07:06:14 2015 UTC,"Haha, I read through and thought the same thing. Especially the ""my dreams were crushed"" part."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Yomanpepsican,-2,Sat May 23 10:37:14 2015 UTC,"And you take my comment way too serious too. You really think I was THAT mad over it ? It annoyed (should've used that word instead I suppose) me quite a bit, yes, but that's all. I expected to have a great time watching one of my favorite streamers play one of my favorite games, but got wrecked in the end. I don't get how you could judge me and my life just from this single comment, you must be some kind of psychic of something. Or a person with a superiority complex, I guess that works too."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,BecsFTW,11,Sat May 23 07:20:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, screw him for not wanting to play what you want him to play"
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,IJudgePCBuilds,-9,Sat May 23 06:09:39 2015 UTC,"He didn't give Bayonetta 2 a fair shot, AT ALL (even though this game is extremely enjoyable to stream/watch/play). He was grumpy as hell from his 24h stream and chat was really toxic too. He often complains that there is no game to play other than the usual stuff, but doesn't want to give very good single player games another try because he's not in the ""mood"" apparently. And he's never in the ""mood"", let's be honest here. At least there is still sub sunday, the only day I watch the stream more than 1 hour straight. The other streaming days got very boring after a while, H1Z1 is always the same thing, Rust is full of stream snipers screaming like 10 y/o and A3L is pretty much the same thing over and over (Lirik fucking with cops with Lo Chang and Sayeed). That's why I was hyped as fuck for Lirik's playthrough of The Witcher 3."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,vortexnl,8,Sat May 23 06:59:17 2015 UTC,do you get angry at people in the real life too when they don't act like you want them to act?
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,BecsFTW,3,Sat May 23 07:37:36 2015 UTC,Everyone has different tastes.
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Swerry,9,Sat May 23 00:14:14 2015 UTC,"Such a shame. I was so looking forward to the playthrough. I think he was the only streamer I follow who was doing just story, avoid side quests thing - which really appealed to me with it being such a big ass game. Maybe he'll get a craving for a single player game... one day :P"
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,elloman11,21,Fri May 22 16:57:18 2015 UTC,"Is anyone surprised at this point?  Witcher 3 is added on to a growing list of games we'll never see completed on stream.  FEAR, Ori and the Blind Forest, Mafia 2, Black Mesa, etc.  RIP"

DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Hellhunter,9,Sat May 23 17:40:17 2015 UTC,Why the fuck...would you hype the game up so much when you know that you don't enjoy streaming RPG's and are just gonna disappoint people. Just say from the start you'll most likely stream it for a day or two and play the rest offline....Holy fuck.
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,icefriend,7,Sun May 24 06:51:20 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunate, really wanted to see the story through. No way I can invest that much time into playing it myself though."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,petarkazic,2,Fri May 22 16:47:47 2015 UTC,But you could watch it?
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,outla5t,9,Fri May 22 23:39:44 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar case, I can watch the stream while I work (Lucky I guess) but I could not find the time to actually play (or afford for that matter) the game.  Today Lirik crushed my heart because I was enjoying his play-trough a lot, but hey, if he is not having fun playing it on stream I respect and understand his decision to stop."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Capn_C,1 point,Sat May 23 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah alright, that sounds pretty reasonable. Sorry"
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Mari0us,2,Sat May 23 10:15:19 2015 UTC,"yeah, what the other guy said, i half-watch the stream on a tablet while doing other stuff. plus i doubt that my i5, 760m laptop can even handle the game."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,kramretnug,3,Sat May 23 10:53:17 2015 UTC,Who else is hyped for liriks fallout 4 playtrough...oh wait.
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,elloman11,5,Sat May 23 15:19:27 2015 UTC,"You guys shouldn't be surprised any game that requires a real good amount of time to get in to/finish/play in general has a 90% chance Lirik will give up on it within 20 minutes to 2 days. That's just how he plays no side quests, no grinding just straight to the point & if it's gonna take more than a couple days to beat it's almost guaranteed he's not gonna finish it. I mean Ori is a 8-9 hour game & he didn't beat it no way he was putting 30-50hr to beat Witcher 3.   I personally don't care in the Witcher 3 case cause there are so many great streamers already playing it to death plus to me it's not that enjoyable to watch I'll take the night streams with Shorty & Waffle over the Witcher but hell I'd take that over A3L too."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Akkie96,3,Sat May 23 04:10:51 2015 UTC,I personally don't mind too much since I've been avoiding his stream because of W3 spoilers. That being said it would still be cool if he at least finished the main story.
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Yomanpepsican,5,Fri May 22 16:59:59 2015 UTC,"It would be cool for people that don't play the game themselves, yeah.  We basically got blue balled really hard on that one. And the other good streamers are way ahead of Lirik story wise."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,elloman11,1 point,Fri May 22 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"I've checked CohnCarnage stream today and he's doing hardest difficulty. He's a bit behind(witches quest) on what Lirik was doing, he's nearly lvl 13 and with i guess around 70 deaths(thats the most interesting for me lol). But yeah, i've seen him dropping frames like crazy today and it seems it's not only today so the stream was kinda unwatchable. I'll be checking him from time to time if Lirik really drops W3 for good"
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,ReadingNotAllowed,2,Fri May 22 20:18:03 2015 UTC,"He records it and posts it so there aren't any frame drops in the YouTube videos, if you don't mind not watching live."

DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,Mauware,1 point,Fri May 22 16:55:38 2015 UTC,"One day he said he only plays games when he streams. I don't think he's going to ever play TW3 again, he same the exact same thing you said about DA:I as well."
DatGuyLirik,36w1wm,ThePhenomMan,1 point,Sat May 23 01:00:09 2015 UTC,I'd be fine either way if he decides to continue playing it or not.

DatGuyLirik,36pu6p,BillBates1986,-3,Thu May 21 06:37:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe because you became even more lazy and unconsistant with what you are doing? I am watching you from the get go, since the no mic BF sessions throgh everything Arma 2 related (dayz mod , island life, BattleRoyal, overwatch, overpoch etc pp).  I am not whining about stuff has changed, its normal with the growing process.  But i am whining about you a bit, cause i miss the guy who is playing with joy and consistency.  I know that there is no main game at the moment like it was with DayZ mod these days. A3L hit or miss. ARMA 3 BR - fine if servers are working H1Z1 BR - a CoD with a bigger map and more players DayZ SA - 2 Years in, lets wait 2 more maybe it will become decent.  Also 10-20 times more people, what makes chat to a clusterfuck.  To get to a point.  ARMA 3 BattleRoyal, once it came out you loved it, you played activly and also did get some infos about the game.  Nowdays if you start it you dont know what have changed, you are only going for the ""drive a car to the end (tactic)"" And then you are asking yourself why it has been harder to reach something there and why you dont have fun?  People playing it over and over, like you did at the early stage, the mass went away like allways, the core is staying, the core knows to shoot a vehicle tank /wheel instead of the driver in certain circumstances.  Dont get me wrong, you are still a amzing shot, but you went from a pationated streamer who likes to own and reach something to a casual ""lets just do it and see how it will end"" guy.  English is my 4th language, but i hope you get me.  Btw i missed in the 3 years maybe 30-50 streams, sometimes just listening cause of work or watching vods, but i am/was arround for a bit.  <3 old DayZ Mod lirik voice"

DatGuyLirik,36pu6p,0_________o,6,Thu May 21 20:13:56 2015 UTC,"He's playing for over 30k people now, and while consistency might be something you enjoy, it does not work for everyone. So, while you're irritated that there's less A3L, or Arma BR, he's appeasing probably about 15k+ people by playing something new and different, and mixing in some of the old favs here and there. The kick now is witcher, but next week, it'll be something else. Try to understand that he's not hear to ensure just YOUR entertainment. To assume this, is to be a selfish prick. He's trying to please the masses, and just like a political figure, or an actor, or comedian, it is extremely hard to please everyone. Take the stream in stride, enjoy the evolution like I have, since I've been watching just as long as you have, or move on. He's said it before, if you don't like the direction he's taking, feel free to branch out to a different streamer(s) to watch."
DatGuyLirik,36pu6p,BillBates1986,-2,Thu May 21 06:34:01 2015 UTC,"You dont get me face, i dont care what game he is playing, i also understand that you cant play some games at a daily base without getting brain fuckedthat you need a timeout.  For me it is the change, at A3L you doint have to think a bit about it instead of playing, the game developes every time by itself, thats why it is hit or miss.  But at tactical games, where RP isnt the main part you can make a difference with knowing some stuff and literly said getting prepared.  Lirik was in the old days someone who prepared his shit and nowdays its just play button and lets see, also if something works out fine a few times, never change it, but that aint working anymore.  I am a single person i dont wanna change another person, i just wrote what i experienced the last 3 years and i tried to do it without a wall of text, i wasnt very successfull.  @ Lorik  I guess it wasnt the nicest/smartest way for my 1st reddit post after reading for months and being at the stream for such a long time, but that 100% managable accident just did it for me. It just said ""lazy fuck"" in my head.  Sorry for it and keep doing what you are doing  Btw:  It would be more fair for sub sunday to roll, and just reroll double choosen games with a second roll, not rolling 30+ times to have 10m different games at once. You are destroying the odds for more voted games that way."
DatGuyLirik,36pu6p,Yomanpepsican,3,Thu May 21 06:58:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you're talking about, I have been watching the stream for a very long time now too, and Lirik always had a ""yolo""/rush playstyle when it came to first person shooters and that's one of the things I loved about the stream. He always relied on quick thinking and his reflexes instead of being someone who'd snipe from atop a tower or something. That's what shorty did, because lirik was always heading into trouble, so he was Lirik's overwatch. And that was a long long time ago, and he still always heads straight into trouble.  Just understand this, you are the vocal minority and Lirik is the streamer. Don't take it to heart if you feel ""ignored"", you are not entitled to anything. Also, I don't understand what you are trying to say with your sub sunday suggestion. Do you know how sub sunday games are chosen? Think of it like a slot machine, with all the votes for every game put inside, most likely you'll get the higher voted games, but anything can happen."
DatGuyLirik,36pu6p,Palivizumab,2,Thu May 21 13:44:11 2015 UTC,"So, you're upset that he's playing games too casually? Just trying to get to the bottom of of your frustration. You want him to research the  way to be the best at every game before he plays it?"
DatGuyLirik,36pu6p,ajaxwow,2,Thu May 21 07:50:12 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong about expressing your opinion, but I have no idea what the fuck you are talking about. Besides how is it possible not to change a stream that goes from 2k viewers to 30k. Everything has changed, twitch changed too.  After 3 years isn't possible you got over Lirik's stream? that doesn't mean he is a bad streamer or he did anything wrong at all. You can't entertain a single person forever.  I hope i didn't put this wrong, i can see people miss understanding my message."

DatGuyLirik,36l3st,meandyouandyouandme,15,Wed May 20 12:08:23 2015 UTC,I prefer different styles for every emote. It makes them easier to distinguish in chat. Soon the chat will just have walls of green and white cats. I like the idea of having different looking cats with each of them having an unique expression like it was before.     These are all very recognizable and unique imo.

Likewise maybe a better  emote, for example smaller trashcan and a cat more visibly poking its head out with trash on its head or something.     Also, you're often saying ""I'm done, I'm uninstalling if X"" and man you say it in such a distinctive voice, it would be cool to have an emote go with that.

DatGuyLirik,36l3st,macg1991,8,Wed May 20 04:46:45 2015 UTC,We don't need to glorify retard streamsnipers by giving them their own emotes.  I like the kitty Mario Kart though.
DatGuyLirik,36l3st,The_Rockheart,0,Wed May 20 13:24:45 2015 UTC,"Why do you think it glorifies steam snipers? I think it gives lirik control over what gets posted when there are stream snipers. For example, the two most recent stream snipers in Rust kept harassing lirik and asking chat to spam Kappa123 or Kappa//. What a stream sniper wants is attention and they get that by seeing chat spam those Kappa123. By making an emote for stream sniping it takes the attention away from what the sniper wants and back onto the channel. At least in my opinion.   Either way I agree with you that I like the kitty Mario kart idea better. Here's hoping geers can make some magic happen"
DatGuyLirik,36l3st,macg1991,3,Wed May 20 14:18:56 2015 UTC,"Dedicating an emote to reacting to streamsnipers is giving them the attention they want.

DatGuyLirik,36o5t6,swinnnk,-3,Thu May 21 09:59:42 2015 UTC,before liriks white knights come in.  OP is right. also.. i understand that he plays arma3  stuff. cause many funny things can happen there. i like it when he plays that. (even i never touched it) but.. h1z1 seems like a whole PR thing.. or he doesnt want to make arc sad so he plays h1z1 from time to time.  i find the game BORING as hell 2 watch (specially br)
DatGuyLirik,36o5t6,HansVanHugendong,3,Wed May 20 22:00:36 2015 UTC,"LOL! You can't be sponsored by a game and not disclose it on twitch.

DatGuyLirik,36et3a,kredes,4,Mon May 18 20:50:48 2015 UTC,Probably has to do with you having a poor connection/computer and the recent changes on Twitch for streamers to opt into the option of having a smaller stream delay. There is some negative side affects such as viewers with shitty internet experiencing what looks like frame drops/lag.  The recent changes have only been in affect for maybe the past 4 days
DatGuyLirik,36et3a,shortyyguy,1 point,Tue May 19 06:47:45 2015 UTC,Both my pc and internet are more than fine. Didnt happen yesterday when he streamed The Witcher 3.

DatGuyLirik,36et3a,GamersComm,2,Tue May 19 06:46:23 2015 UTC,For me it has been screen tearing now from his stream.
DatGuyLirik,36d3o6,Fleximex,13,Mon May 18 12:46:49 2015 UTC,"a) 50k+ people streaming on 6k bitrate would put an enormous strain on twitch's connections, that's why they don't allow him to to stream at this bitrate and allow others to do it because they only have around 1k viewers  b) fuck you, don't watch on a 60 inch tv and you won't see the difference. A lot of people don't have that kind of connection or they also like to do something else while watching the stream and use the same connection.   Not to mention he doesn't gain anything by raising the bitrate, sure you will be a bit happier but he loses a chunk of people, possibly thousands. On the other hand if he doesn't, you'll bitch from time to time but continue watching and he keeps all the people with slower connections too. No-brainer."

DatGuyLirik,36d3o6,Zvejs,1 point,Tue May 19 06:52:41 2015 UTC,Is he really scaling down to 864p? What's the benefit of that vs. 1080p?
DatGuyLirik,36d3o6,RezicG,2,Tue May 19 12:44:51 2015 UTC,60 fps vs 30 fps.
DatGuyLirik,36d3o6,Eglaerinion,1 point,Tue May 19 13:01:23 2015 UTC,I see. What are the differences when using 1080p and 60fps though? Worse stream quality?
DatGuyLirik,36d3o6,RezicG,1 point,Tue May 19 13:02:38 2015 UTC,He is most likely using around 3500-4000 on source. The reason behind that is because anything beyond that is an overkill. The 60fps and 1080p stops @ 3500. Using anymore would waste resources.  I. Twitch.tv ToS: Ingest cap

DatGuyLirik,36cvxu,tuestresfat,-1,Mon May 18 11:37:17 2015 UTC,The point im saying is if the eye can only see 60FPS is there any reason to run it at 200FPS when the eye can't tell the difference.
DatGuyLirik,36cvxu,PGpanda,1 point,Mon May 18 11:51:07 2015 UTC,The reason is simply that you in fact can tell the difference. The Eye doesn't work in fps. Many frames per second are just the only way we can create the illusion of something moving with a series of still pictures. The more pictures per second the better the illusion.

DatGuyLirik,3636h3,ctothejl,3,Fri May 15 18:36:44 2015 UTC,About 6; I got the impression that approaching streamers and getting your game on Twitch is an increasingly popular marketing tool for publishers nowadays. I'm really happy to hear Lirik's stance on this and hope he will never give in.  I also think 11. is the correct thing to do as a professional streamer.
DatGuyLirik,3636h3,Herbspiceguy,7,Sat May 16 09:45:56 2015 UTC,Awesome interview but I disagree with the part about people not watching old games.   There is always an audience for that stuff sometimes throughout the day and most big games always have hundreds of streams above you.   It's nice being in a niche game and get impressions or clicks purely from there not being many other people streaming that game.  It's easy to forget that you start out at literally 0 viewers 0 followers.  Maintain a schedule and pick the right games and people will eventually notice or drop by.
DatGuyLirik,3636h3,0b4m4,4,Fri May 15 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's difficult to start streaming with an old game. You can stream old games when you already have a certain amount of viewers. But then again, what do I know? I'm just a pleb."
DatGuyLirik,3636h3,Daedalist,1 point,Sat May 16 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"I think Lirik is right in saying as a new streamer you do need to pick the right, popular games to gain momentum.  But once you're as a big as Lirik I think it's fine to stream old games. Even though an old game can be of questionable quality, it can still provide a unique experience and a lot laughs like that FMV heavy, horror-ish game Harvester, whereas the latest game on Steam (Early Access) could be boring as fuck and not have a high entertainment factor."
DatGuyLirik,362yr7,DDyliard,2,Fri May 15 17:36:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is lower than before. Watch this Vod or any other Vodfrom before he got the new pc, and compare it to the stream now, it's clearly lower."
DatGuyLirik,362yr7,Goddess_Jessica,1 point,Sat May 16 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's lower but quality seems shittier. When i watch VOD, quality reminds me 1-2 year old VODS."

DatGuyLirik,363ngd,NormalStranger,1 point,Fri May 15 22:12:15 2015 UTC,That's the difference in community and modded. Modded servers are just community servers (which are stock) with mods.

I'm not saying this will happen to him if he does use a cam, but I've seen plenty of broadcasters get big to like 2 to 3k with a cam and then for some reason they stopped using the cam and suddenly their viewers frop to the realm of the hundreds.

DatGuyLirik,363gtm,cplpantz,7,Fri May 15 19:59:40 2015 UTC,So you are a streamsniper or something ? Why would you defend them when they are retards who wants the ruin the game and also stream ? Fk them :)
DatGuyLirik,363gtm,8MbRabbit,-7,Fri May 15 20:26:19 2015 UTC,Because degrading someone over something as petty as that is the pinnacle of human scum.  I don't streamsnipe because I have better things to do but this is basically equivalent of degrading someone over skin color.
DatGuyLirik,363gtm,Yomanpepsican,8,Fri May 15 22:02:44 2015 UTC,"?Wtf? We have no control over our skin color, yet anyone can choose not to be an attention whore on stream."
DatGuyLirik,363gtm,wearscape1rl,6,Fri May 15 22:09:19 2015 UTC,That has got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. You are fucking retarded for making that comparison.
DatGuyLirik,363gtm,Arkwoman1990,5,Fri May 15 23:36:10 2015 UTC,Um....you are stupid.
DatGuyLirik,363gtm,Short_Kings,1 point,Fri May 15 23:43:08 2015 UTC,"Comparing streamsnipers to the plight of people discriminated against because of the color of their skin is probably the most stupid shit anyone has ever said on the internet, congratulations moron, you just lowered the bar a bit more."

DatGuyLirik,35yvui,swirreftw,3,Thu May 14 22:36:47 2015 UTC,Why was Actorguy named Actorguy?
DatGuyLirik,35yvui,LordXerces,2,Thu May 14 23:20:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know acutally, I think he just kind of over(role)played certain scenarios."
DatGuyLirik,35yvui,swirreftw,2,Thu May 14 23:43:10 2015 UTC,"Actorguy was named this because back in DayZ, Lirik ran found this guy (probably a stream sniper) in which he made him ""act"" like he was taken hostage in Elektro.  He was used as bait so Lirik could find people to kill.  That is where the ""OH MY GOD"" line came from (as the guy ran around the streets).  Then, Actorguy got really annoying and started joining DayZ everyday trying to play with Lirik."

DatGuyLirik,35uzi2,Sonox,5,Wed May 13 19:05:41 2015 UTC,He did great! I've seen alot of dropped frames and this was one of the best. Thanks Lirik
DatGuyLirik,35uzi2,Assassassin,14,Thu May 14 00:08:47 2015 UTC,It was pretty hilarious. He trolled all of us saying he wouldn't do a cam for the show and even started it off with a lirikThump picture instead of his webcam. That being said I don't think he should use a webcam for his stream still.
DatGuyLirik,35uzi2,l0st_t0y,4,Thu May 14 02:44:57 2015 UTC,"That being said I don't think he should use a webcam for his stream still.   Agreed.  If he wants to he could maybe do it for some games, but generally it's quite nice to have the game in focus with very little clutterish stream overlays.  Even a webcam can be annoying and in the way.   Also I'm sure it must be nice to stream without a webcam, not having to worry about how you look etc when streaming."

DatGuyLirik,35uzi2,Nikkanai,3,Wed May 13 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"Wow. That's what I would've done, but that's not what I expected Lirik to do. Not sure if he might make it a normal thing. To go Illuminati on it. What's the red behind him? It doesn't look like a wall. I thought it might be a green screen (But red obv) but I doubt he couldn't get a green material. I know some people cover their mic area with a little wall of rough material to dampen echo. Could just be to cover the background."
DatGuyLirik,35uzi2,66hi3,9,Wed May 13 19:13:21 2015 UTC,Could just be to cover the background.   Definitely hiding the dildo collection on the nightstand.
DatGuyLirik,35uzi2,ClottedTampon,3,Wed May 13 22:32:24 2015 UTC,Could just be to cover the background.   Most likely. Probably why he ended his stream 45min before the show started. Most likely some piece ofsheet he found to cover the background
DatGuyLirik,35uzi2,redditor401,3,Wed May 13 19:16:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the red sheet is to cover the back of his room. Obviously he didn't plan on having a cam on, atleast he didn't plan on it for a long time, so he just took the most fab he could find to cover up some shit and didn't want to clean his room"

DatGuyLirik,35uzi2,Yomanpepsican,3,Thu May 14 04:14:57 2015 UTC,Was cool to see him outside of just pictures. But as others are saying i hope he never makes it a thing on his stream. I really don't like cams since it usually take the focus away from the most important thing; the game.

DatGuyLirik,35vlia,TheDeleeted,9,Thu May 14 16:22:23 2015 UTC,"I actually think he did a really great job today. He isn't awkward, he's really laid back. Hopefully one day he will decide to stream with a cam that would be sweet but no pressure"
DatGuyLirik,35vlia,hunterkiller001,23,Thu May 14 00:24:32 2015 UTC,I agree that he did a really good job today but I hope he does not decide to use a cam during his regular stream. A lot of Liriks magic comes from his reactions and awesome RP and like a good book the enjoyment is significantly enhanced by the viewer/readers own imagination.
DatGuyLirik,35vlia,rcon__,9,Thu May 14 07:16:01 2015 UTC,"100% agree! The stream is great as it is, no need to change it."
DatGuyLirik,35vlia,BecsFTW,4,Thu May 14 07:41:48 2015 UTC,"He'd never do that. I'd welcome ""special streams"" like once or twice a year when he streams with a cam though."

The VoDs are always on https://www.youtube.com/user/itmeJP/videos and it's supposed to be a talkshow/podcast mainly about twitch, not gaming, but they do talk a ton about gaming"
DatGuyLirik,35vlia,stjunk,0,Thu May 14 18:31:41 2015 UTC,To put it bluntly he did not come across That good looking to me when i first saw him (pax) but to me he appears very hot in this interview/on cam and digging the foreshadow beard/hairstyle.

DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,annadayz,7,Wed May 13 22:15:25 2015 UTC,"I know you've already seen them Anna but for those that haven't, here were my suggestions.   Set rule list This gives mods something they can point to when a post is removed or people are banned. Auto Moderator With specific customization It could really take over some of the workload from the mods. Post tags Allows people to quickly find the kind of content they want to see. Discussion threads If you browse a lot of subreddits, you may have come across what is called free talk friday. A post where people with a common interest (in this case the stream) can just talk about anything. Be it cats, girls, or movies, whatever you want. If you browse /r/NFL or /r/Soccer you will see live game threads. I think we could do something similar for events such as the survivor games. Then we could just have topic discussions. Such as 'What was your favourite stream moment' 'What's your opinion on paid skyrim mods'.   I think the sidebar could use some streamlining. If the emotes could be condensed to a menu or something. As a quick update, sub sundays 17, 18, and 19 are missing (Not sure if you want to include 17 though).   Not sure what people have against the banner. It is an old picture, but im not sure what you could put up there. Maybe if someone could make something, like a panorama of all the 'characters' lirik plays. Could do it as a competition.  Overall, I think the subreddit just needs a little more effort form both sides and it can be turned into the water cooler it was born to be."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,66hi3,2,Thu May 14 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"I got the idea to make this thread from your suggestions, so thank you for reposting these here!"
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,koen092,9,Thu May 14 01:33:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how everything on Reddit works but I'd like to see more forum like topics. A topic place to show of your 'fanart', a topic for shirt pics, a topic to talk about the Rust sub server, a topic to request vods etc. I guess it's the nature of Reddit but I feel like a lot of stuff gets lost in the list of seperate topics."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,sivyan,5,Wed May 13 22:31:12 2015 UTC,"I really like this idea and I wish reddit had a better system for it. If someone were to post ""Post Lirik Fanart here"", the thread eventually gets buried because it's not stickied. I'll have to think more about this one, good suggestion!"
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,DaimyoValk,5,Wed May 13 22:35:51 2015 UTC,"Make a ""Fanart Friday"" or something where a mod makes a post every week and people can comment and post their stuff in it.   That way it won't get buried."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,TylerConlin,3,Thu May 14 00:37:59 2015 UTC,This is a cool idea :D
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,DzejBee,2,Thu May 14 00:47:54 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add that tags/post flairs can assist with this. Once posts are tagged they can easily be searched and organized. For example, you could search ""flair:fanart"" to see all posts tagged as fanart."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,TylerConlin,1 point,Thu May 14 07:37:48 2015 UTC,I can see where you are coming from here. Everything is posted as a new post on the subreddit as opposed to one thread for each thing making it more user friendly (Like Sub Sunday already is). That might be tricky to do though for each subject since the mods here can not predict exactly what people are going to want to post or talk about.
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,DzejBee,1 point,Wed May 13 22:34:17 2015 UTC,Answer to that is forums. But no one wants those apparently x)
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,bicarbofyoda,0,Wed May 13 22:54:56 2015 UTC,i think we should have one or the other. Using both can get annoying for the every day person

DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Plucky_KS,1 point,Thu May 14 00:21:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with your second point, I think the subreddit is sometimes over moderated.  To be clear, I have no problem with deleting irrelevant or toxic posts.    However, if someone puts across a point in a reasonable and constructive manner I don't think it should be deleted.  There have been a number of posts which, even if I disagreed with them, I felt fell under that category which have disappeared over the past few months."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Rasfada,1 point,Thu May 14 15:43:20 2015 UTC,There was a post that noticed that a lot of people's posts were getting deleting and that post was deleted by a mod immediately. I was there when it happened. The OP of that thread didn't delete it himself. He was actually surprised it happened to him.
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,GavoTrav,1 point,Thu May 14 16:01:01 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with the banner? I'd appreciate it if you could be more constructive rather than ""change the banner""   Also, some posts do not belong in the subreddit or are repeated. Some posts are simply deleted by Lirik because he doesn't want them on here and he has every right to that. Most posts that are deleted have reasoning as to why."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Plucky_KS,3,Thu May 14 00:24:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, the image is very dark. The Lirik logo is too large. The Twitch.Tv/Lirik is arbitrary."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,GavoTrav,2,Thu May 14 00:33:37 2015 UTC,"I'd second the removal or modification of the Twitch.tv/Lirik. Looks a bit weird considering the font type that Lirik uses on Twitch and the font type being used in this instance. I remember Lirik going for graphic uniformity across all platforms and I feel like at least making that a different font could finish that! By the way, thanks for starting this Anna. Nice to know you guys listen to our input."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Yomanpepsican,1 point,Thu May 14 01:29:18 2015 UTC,"The red text ""SUBS! DON'T FORGET TO...."" is kinda annoying ontop of  twitch.tv/lirik."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Yomanpepsican,1 point,Thu May 14 01:36:58 2015 UTC,"Where do you suggest this is moved? I think it's intention is to be seen by the most possible subs, to remind them to vote for sub sunday."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Yomanpepsican,1 point,Thu May 14 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"IMO, I would prefer to put ""VOTE FOR SUB SUNDAY"" on right side, if there is enough space. I see there are ""Hey There"", ""Links"", ""Sponsors"" etc."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,0b4m4,1 point,Thu May 14 01:47:15 2015 UTC,I like it personally. Not enough people vote.

DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Knullgubbe,1 point,Thu May 14 12:21:43 2015 UTC,weird...seems like banner wasn't optimized with the resolution basic. So the banner aren't dynamic according to resolution?
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,TylerConlin,1 point,Thu May 14 16:41:25 2015 UTC,The banner was lirik's request when I changed it he told me to change it back.
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,alex_bout09,1 point,Thu May 14 12:20:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure when people are upvoting the main post if they dislike the banner or if they particularly dislike ""posts being deleted"". If lots of people hate the banner, maybe it's time for a change that can be discussed with Lirik. I personally like the banner. For now it will stay and another thread will be posted at a later date to see opinions on the banner maybe?"
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,0b4m4,2,Thu May 14 15:03:18 2015 UTC,"Hello, just wanted to say that I think what this subreddit needs, is more exposure. I may be thick as fuck, but it just feels like it could be way more active? Like Lirik's twitter, everyone knows about it, but his subreddit is relatively very small. People just aren't subconsciously aware of the subreddit, they don't ever visit even if they know it exists. Even I just realized I wasn't subscribed to the subreddit.  I personally think that reddit has a certain edge over other social platforms like twitter. Followers and subscribers of lirik go to twitter to see Lirik's divine tweets to hail them as holy scripture. But I think people would want to see more of the community in the subreddit, and that initially means rudimentary forms of funny ass shit like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BTghjM6zsA or other parodies or even gifs/pictures that we sometimes see in chat linking to imgur. Personally, I would also like to see things like suggestions, nostalgia posts, or even stories and accounts from viewers (particularly the age long ones) and mods. All these things happen with ease, when the community engages with each other.  I am very surprised there's still not a lot of parodies or stuff outside of stream highlights related to Lirik on youtube. That's why I really think the Fanart Friday idea is very cool, if you get too much art, maybe someone can make a video and showcase the best, if he or she has time.   As for marketing the subreddit to lirik's viewers, I don't really know, but I have confidence that you guys can do it. Lirik himself doesn't use this place a lot, he barely talks about the subreddit. But it makes sense, a subreddit is to be mainly driven by the viewers. I do know for a fact that a shit ton of people talk in chat when Lirik is offline on twitch, so it's not like the viewers don't socialize with each other. They just don't do it here that much, at least to my knowledge, and I guess it's because we are more well suited to ""quickchatting"" and the general topic in a subreddit about a broadcaster, generally remains limited."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Tapanator,1 point,Thu May 14 03:49:24 2015 UTC,"You have a great point, the subreddit definitely needs more exposure. I did have a quick question in chat and asked how many people frequent it, and those who were in offline chat said they do come here if not even every day at least once a week. I think exposure is important and the best way to go about it would be to expose it in chat and set a goal on subscribers. Also, events like ""fan art fridays"" could make more people come to it."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,rcon__,2,Thu May 14 04:48:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree considering we all originate from chat. There's one more thing that I kinda personally wanted from the subreddit, though I may be alone in this matter.   Sub sunday is pretty much the only day viewers get to affect the stream (besides perhaps annoying lirik on other days). With that said, I felt that there are not too many votes on sub sunday because most of us don't really know what to vote. Someone looking for a first impressions of a game they are interested in, would look at youtube primarily (This way means no spoilers etc etc).   Most just use Sub sunday so that their favorite personality can get the chance to play a game they thought fun, or what they think Lirik would find fun. The rest vote to make him play a game that they already like watching him play, maybe because they are at a loss in deciding what to vote.  I do the former, but the thing is, I get double-minded. I just thought that maybe having like a preliminary sub sunday discussion would help people make a choice on a game they'd want to vote on. For example, I recall Lirik saying on stream about how HalfLife 2 is probably outdated now. Chat, being passionate as always, wanted to prove him wrong by giving him the chance to play it on sub sunday. The chat was just being riddled with !vote HL2. Though I personally haven't voted HL2, I just thought that it would be great if there was a thread where this fact was noted. I am sure there would be others who would get hyped at the idea of letting Lirik play Hl2 for the first time. Besides, it could improve the quality of games chosen on sub sunday, having the knowledge of what Lirik has already played could also make all the difference."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Dodgeridoo,1 point,Thu May 14 05:36:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea, and good point! i usually never know what to vote for on sub sunday :)"
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Dodgeridoo,1 point,Thu May 14 15:56:08 2015 UTC,"Thany you very, very much for hearing us all out. Best of luck"
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Dodgeridoo,1 point,Thu May 14 16:17:38 2015 UTC,Maybe adding it to the moobot chat rotation every once in a while could drive some traffic over here.
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Dodgeridoo,2,Fri May 15 15:07:24 2015 UTC,"The emotes weren't updated yet as lirik when he decided he was changing stuff said not to update yet.  downvotes were abused to hell so I was asked to hide them, they are not removed and people still down vote but its just harder to do now than it was."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,kijifi,1 point,Thu May 14 12:19:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah okay, i figured the downvotes were abused and that's why they were hidden. I'll take that out until everything is more stable then we can reconsider and do another test.  As for the emotes, I'm not sure why lirik wouldn't want to keep them updated with the stream unless he wants to change them back? I'm not sure, I guess we will have to come back to this one as well and leave it as it is."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,kijifi,2,Thu May 14 15:01:09 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure that you can tag a post with like a type, so say for instance you post a philosophical question, it can be tagged as a discussion. Or if you posted fan art, you could tag it as fan art. It would be cool to see something like that on this subreddit."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,66hi3,2,Thu May 14 12:30:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe a discussion post for each broadcast, so a broadcast doesnt spawn 1-5 shitposts every day. I dont know really."
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Yomanpepsican,3,Thu May 14 13:45:58 2015 UTC,"I would love to do this, but only if there was more activity on the subreddit. I don't really think it has enough yet for a post every day on every broadcast. This could definitely be a great part in the short future!"
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,Limelol,2,Thu May 14 15:08:26 2015 UTC,"I think since Lirik has grown a lot, a lot of the newer subs or people who frequent this subreddit will not know who or what the bean bandits are, so I would agree with changing that. Also I agree with having an updated FAQ.   Also some little things, the flairs need to be updated to reflect the new emotes and the sub sunday links seem to have not been updated, they only show until week 16 for me.   According to Fixatorzz, Lirik does not want too many highlights posted on the twitch channel or youtube so it would be cool to have a place to go with a link of VODs with timestamps where people could post their favorite moments. This could be done various ways, and would clear the subreddit from several people requesting moments and asking people to look up times in VODs"
DatGuyLirik,35vp0x,DzejBee,2,Wed May 13 22:27:21 2015 UTC,"I'll try to work on an updated sidebar section very soon*. As for VODs with timestamps, I have no idea how we could implement another section for this. Also, this would require effort from the viewers, which is already difficult to get on this subreddit alone. I love the idea, but I do wish I could think of a way to easily implement it."

DatGuyLirik,35w5kj,hunterkiller001,9,Thu May 14 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"I'm really tired of basically every streamer using webcams. Your face isn't that pretty, so stop filling a quarter of my screen with it. It's one of the main reasons I watch Lirik, I'm actually watching a game being played instead of some dude or dudette awkwardly trying to do some funny facial expressions each 10 minutes."
DatGuyLirik,35w5kj,Scabendari,4,Thu May 14 03:51:48 2015 UTC,I could see cam streams fitting really well with sub sunday when he's mostly screwing around in games and chat.  It's kind of weird seeing people roleplay with cam on in games like A3L though.  Kind of ruins the immersion.
DatGuyLirik,35w5kj,phokas,2,Thu May 14 01:50:09 2015 UTC,"It would be awkward (for him particularly) and the subject of attention for a long time to come considering how much time has passed since he started streaming without a cam. Still, it is unfortunate for the ladies, I guess they'll just have to resort to their imagination."
DatGuyLirik,35w5kj,Yomanpepsican,2,Thu May 14 04:00:37 2015 UTC,"Nope. I like the stream as it is. Lirik's personality and voice has carried  the channel thus far so there's no real need or reason to add the cam. TBH I don't think people should badger him to stream with a cam, so people ought to just chill and just look forward to when he guests on Dropped Frames (if they invite him back again) ;)"
DatGuyLirik,35w5kj,BecsFTW,1 point,Thu May 14 14:23:45 2015 UTC,"My answer would be yes, but honestly I really do not care.  It should be up to the broadcaster and as long as you get the amount of viewers that you want, then there should be no reason to change."
DatGuyLirik,35w5kj,vanderjaght,1 point,Thu May 14 01:01:53 2015 UTC,Why must people always look at posts in a negative way? I'm not telling him to do it... I was just curious to see who else would like to see him stream with a cam? It was just a harmless straw poll but I'm sure many people will come here to hate and down vote.
DatGuyLirik,35w5kj,vanderjaght,2,Thu May 14 01:10:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry you believe that is negative, I am sure you have read a lot of comments in this subreddit and there are a lot more negative ones then mine. I suppose it's hard to realize someone's tone on the internet.   Was just providing honest feedback on how I felt and it was not in direction of your post.   As someone else has said in the suggestions stickied post, I think downvoting is disabled unless you are on mobile."

I'm still sceptical due to the trailer being so feature packed and the game only being in development for 6-7 months (confirmed by the dev in the interview), but as it releases in less than 3 weeks we won't have long to see if it lives up to the promise."
DatGuyLirik,35qk1z,rcon__,1 point,Tue May 12 19:03:42 2015 UTC,"Link is good and thanks for taking the time to post it for those who missed it.   No problem. Thats like my job on some subreddits to post videos/news of Video Makers/Livestreamers that I like so the community can stay in the loop.  And yeah, this game got me a bit sceptical as well. I guess when Summit1G or Lirik livestreams this game on June 2nd we will see if the game is good or not."
DatGuyLirik,35qk1z,rcon__,1 point,Tue May 12 21:20:03 2015 UTC,"Lirik said on stream tonight that he might have early early access, next week or the week after, so that will be perfect, before any of us have to invest money for the EA release. For me, due to the short development time, I'll need to see Lirik (or another streamer) playing it before I invest any money on this one. Still excited about it though."

For those that don't know Dropped Frames is a weekly Twitch broadcast hosted by itmeJP, Ezekiel_III (Zeke) and CohhCarnage and usually features one guest each week. They discuss all things Twitch, broadcasting and games.  It is an excellent weekly show that's very entertaining and candid/honest at times and well worth checking out. They switch host channels every week between them, but you can catch all past shows on JP's YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/itmeJP"

DatGuyLirik,35ph2q,Zouljer,5,Tue May 12 13:12:52 2015 UTC,"Lirik would not be doing his job very well if he ignored exciting new early access titles such as this or the opportunity to interview the devs for that matter. It is not Liriks job to sell the game to you, simply provide the heads up/information. It is your responsibilty as the potential buyer, not Liriks, ""to look into this one"" and decide if you wish to invest in early access or not. And that's what you do with early access titles, you invest, and we all know the risks of investing."
DatGuyLirik,35ph2q,rcon__,3,Tue May 12 14:33:03 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you should take some more time watching the interview. He directly speaks about the links between this game, stomping lands, and early access titles throughout the interview. The interview was honest and at some points icy. Lirik played his role in the interview well and I didn't feel there was much bias or ""hyping up"" from either end. That being said looking at it from a common sense perspective its a very ambitious game and its not Lirik's job to decide whether you should buy a game or not, if that was true then ign should of been sued by now.  420/10 Best post on reddit, would read again. - Ign 2015"
DatGuyLirik,35ph2q,PGpanda,2,Tue May 12 15:09:33 2015 UTC,"Panda, the one thing that sets alarm bells off for me is that the game has only been in development for 6-7 months and that just doesn't match the great things I am seeing in the trailer, especially considering the trailer supposedly consists of all gameplay.  If they have pulled off that quality and depth of gameplay in merely 6-7 months then either they purchased a lot of completed ""assets"" from another non completed game or they have a payroll the size of Valves.  It's enough to make me hold off investing in this one until after release and I've read some Steam reviews. It's still very exciting though if it's genuine."
DatGuyLirik,35ph2q,rcon__,3,Tue May 12 15:19:49 2015 UTC,"Best case scenario they're only lying about the development time or are using pre existing assets from a project that didn't work out.  Or they are like, you know, super devs!"
DatGuyLirik,35ph2q,Short_Kings,1 point,Tue May 12 15:35:26 2015 UTC,The guy said that they're all pretty experienced devs so they have a pretty good idea of what to be working on - I think he even pointed out that you might see dumb animations like people sliding and shit - in order to get other features and the amount of stuff they have in.   But still 6-7 months is pretty sketch for what they showed in the video. I would think they had people working on it before and as they added people they decided to just start a studio.
DatGuyLirik,35ph2q,Nemoswang,1 point,Fri May 15 12:56:57 2015 UTC,"Very true, like I said its clearly an ambitious project if not over ambitious. All I'm really trying to say is people need to put some effort into making these decisions by themselves. Falling for hype is what has made pre-ordering and early access such a issue in the modern day. I guess in that sense I agree with Op to a degree. Perhaps the real message here was lost in his wording."
DatGuyLirik,35ph2q,PGpanda,1 point,Tue May 12 15:47:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I totally agree with you there and said as much in my original reply to the OP.
DatGuyLirik,35ph2q,rcon__,1 point,Tue May 12 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"Lirik handled it very well, Asked a good few questions and got a straight answer from Jesse, He was talking about the stomping lands before the interview started and said he was going to be straight up with the guy.  Also this game is already playable for there early alpha testers.  He also confirmed the price would be 25$ and feature no Micro Transactions.  Other than that he can't do anything else, the trailer was endorsed by playstation and stuff too so It looks like they are serious about the development of this game. Starting on PC and porting to consoles, he also said they are working on mod support for full release."
DatGuyLirik,35ph2q,GavoTrav,-1,Tue May 12 22:46:36 2015 UTC,yeah the difference is that these devs actually care for the game and won't run away with the money

DatGuyLirik,35ph2q,Ryuusengan,1 point,Wed May 13 11:18:46 2015 UTC,The guy sounded a lot more passionate about the game and excited for it then the Stomping Lands interview too. So... that seems kind of good.
DatGuyLirik,35pa36,Holymormor,4,Tue May 12 12:01:56 2015 UTC,I can't remember the exact rules but in the EU you have to pay VAT when you import anything outside from the EU with a worth higher than 22(?) euros. I guess the first shirt did not exceed this price or you were just unlucky that they checked the worth of your second package.
DatGuyLirik,35pa36,koen092,2,Tue May 12 13:57:28 2015 UTC,Yea I think you are right. Pretty stupid that it cost less if you make multiply orders instead one with everything in it. 44 USD for one  order to 36 USD with multiply orders
DatGuyLirik,35pa36,Dramatic_Explosion,1 point,Tue May 12 14:29:20 2015 UTC,"This isn't just a Sweden thing, this is standard for anyone shipping outside the US who doesn't have a branch overseas to ship from, or ships at a bulk rate.  I can't do ""free shipping"" on my ebay sales because I have a large client base in the EU/Australia and the shipping prices are ridiculous. The last poster I sent to Australia was something like $35 shipped and they had to pay a customs fee on top of that as a percentage of the insurance cost.  England just privatized their mail system too, so their rates have also gone through the roof."
DatGuyLirik,35pa36,mirac_eren,1 point,Tue May 12 17:13:06 2015 UTC,I paid something like $12.5 on order for the shipping but when i received mail it was saying $15 for shipping fee and the mail man didnt ask for anything (i realized that later on) i guess i ripped of usps

I live in Canada and bought one shirt, my shipping was more expensive than the shirt itself, and cost me $50 total. It's shitty, but it's not really something Teespring itself can change.  Edit: I was wrong, just looked at my recipet to double check, it came to $32 USD total, but with conversion and taxes I paid $50."
DatGuyLirik,35pa36,swirreftw,0,Thu May 14 22:00:40 2015 UTC,Är du säker på att det är frakt och inte moms eller liknande?  (Are you sure it's the shipping and not VAT or something similar?)
DatGuyLirik,35pa36,PGpanda,1 point,Tue May 12 12:15:53 2015 UTC,The first time I ordered a shirt from tee spring I did not recieve this fee but now I got it. There is two fees one is from Postnords avgifter: speditionsavgift on 80 kr and moms 20 kr = 100 kr. The second fee is from Tullen (customs) and their fee is on 98 kroner. FeelsBadMan
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,bloodtake,16,Mon May 11 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"There is no way to give constructive criticism in twitch chat without getting banned and how are you supposed to talk seriously in chat when 5-9k subs are spamming emotes? No-one can see it. Reddit is only choice we get to write what we think and i think reddit vote system shows pretty good how majority of us think about things(emotes).  For example, /u/annadayz top post in this thread, if you write that in chat there is 0 chance Lirik will read it because its too long and you are ""spamming""."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,NeroNakamura,1 point,Tue May 12 08:04:30 2015 UTC,"Murkrig its the complete opposite :( Lirik completely ignores the mods bro, it's an ongoing joke in the channel.

DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,annadayz,1 point,Tue May 12 22:35:00 2015 UTC,"I totally understand. It's huge problem in runescape subreddit where they think they are whole playerbase of the game and demand stuff like little kids.  I'm just explaining why people choose to voice there opinion in this subreddit and not in chat, be it popular or unpopular.  I got nothing against you, i started watching lirik when he did last few judge episodes. And you did a lot for him and i'm sure he and all of us in this subreddit are thankful for it. Maybe you should be Liriks public relations professional?"
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,NeroNakamura,2,Tue May 12 22:36:48 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I really don't have time for that kind of volunteer work at the moment, maybe when I settle down in a few weeks I can get a few mods on board with me and we can see what we can do to better the community a bit.

DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,Yomanpepsican,25,Thu May 14 04:49:13 2015 UTC,"The community becomes what you make it. Most of us know Lirik though, and let's be honest, he's a lazy fuck. On top of that, he's pretty sensitive when it comes to the vocal minority. He gives them way too much attention, and i think those people turn him off from this sub. His choice though, he really doesn't HAVE to communicate with his community other than the occasional tweets. I'm pretty sure he's already larger in popularity than he'd prefer to be."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,relidar,8,Thu May 14 05:11:29 2015 UTC,Telling us to stop watching because we have constructive criticism is like telling lirik to stop streaming because he can't take criticism... You see my point?  We love lirik but judging from all these posts and up votes many of us are tired of getting banned or chewed out for stating our opinions
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,hunterkiller001,-8,Mon May 11 21:41:05 2015 UTC,"Because noone cares what your opinion is. Opinionated people suck. Noone likes them.

The fact that I don't really want to say much more, just in case Lirik does come on here and puts me on blast, speaks for itself.   Whether the person who lirik is responding to in this link is right or wrong, the reaction from lirik just doesn't seem like the right way to handle it   Just me though.  EDIT : In response to those saying that lirik is being perfectly reasonable in saying that there is no point visiting this subreddit - These kinds of communities don't just stand on their own. Time and effort is put in the make communities successful. It's all about what the higher ups put in :/"
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,iReactZz,26,Tue May 12 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"To all the salt on this subreddit lately... you have to understand, Lirik just plays video games. It's not like he's here to particularly entertain each and every one of you. If you don't find it entertaining, why are you watching? Let him do his stream however he wants to do it. At the end of the day, he's just a dude in a house on his computer, playing games like every one of you, but happened to get lots of viewers from it. You guys aren't entitled to anything as viewers, you always have the option to not watch or partake in the community."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,annadayz,43,Mon May 11 21:16:41 2015 UTC,"To all the salt on this subreddit lately   Where else can they go? There are people with genuine criticisms that want to make the stream better. Are they supposed to try and voice that in chat? So they can get banned and told that their own mother doesn't like them? At least here they can post behind another alias.    It's not like he's here to particularly entertain each and every one of you.   No, he's not. But what if I want to see if people agree with my thoughts. I come on over to the subreddit and make a post 'Does anyone else think A3L has gotten worse'. I'm not saying the stream is bad or that I no longer think it's entertaining, I'm not saying he should stop streaming A3L or should change games just for me. I'm probing for support. If no one agrees then maybe that is a sign I should stop watching A3L, maybe I've grown out of the stream. If people agree. Great! I've found people to discuss it with. No one should be personally attacked for voicing their opinion in a coherent manner. I emphasize that because I know what the twitch community is like, and there are the people that will make a post 'A3L suks donkey dick' and I thank you for dealing with that.   If you don't find it entertaining, why are you watching?   If Lirik doesn't enjoy the subreddit, why does he read it?  I don't endorse this line of thinking. It's possible to not like a part of something and still gain overall enjoyment out of it. Yes, if you dislike all of it, why would you put yourself through that. And there are people admitting that they aren't watching as much as they used to. Again, if someone says they don't like A3L, thats no reason for them to stop watching all together. But all they're met with is 'Fuck off you don't have to watch' Who's to say they don't leave and comeback later? They're just voicing their opinion. Granted, it makes up every other post.   That's another problem though. There's almost nothing to talk about on the subreddit. Sub sunday is always the hot topic. And surprise, some people don't like every game, they wish to share they're opinion and are met with abuse. Again some comments are a little low effort, but from the same thread there's this. Let's not even talk about the removed sub sunday. I Suppose my main point here is, how are we supposed to discuss when we can't be negative. Is every thread supposed to be 'senpai so lovely '. There's already plenty of it.   At the end of the day, he's just a dude in a house on his computer, playing games like every one of you, but happened to get lots of viewers from it.   To make a dumb comparison, Justin Bieber is just a boy who sung in a video and happened to get a lot of viewers. Now fans expect a certain quality, if they think the quality drops they are going to voice they're opinion. Let's not pretend Lirik is that small streamer with the g930s anymore.   You guys aren't entitled to anything as viewers   What does entitled even mean anymore. 'Gamers are entitled' 'Twitch chat is entitled' 'Subs are entitled'. Someone says 'I don't like A3L', is that entitlement? no. Someone says 'play dayz now, A3L sucks, I pay your wage' is that entitlement? yes. And let's be honest. Lirik is now a businessman, he runs a business, he has a brand, and he sells a product. People that pay for that product are entitled to something. Not to decide how the business is ran, but to, at least, have their feedback appreciated. Not deemed as 'Pathetic'. Lirik both does and does not do it for free. You don't have to be a sub and you can get the same experience as a sub. But when a sub says 'I find rust boring' they are not a whiny bitch.   Going to rap up here as I've been quite long winded for such a trivial matter. But I've invested almost 3 years in the channel so as sad as it sounds. I care. This isn't a personal attack on you anna or anyone else. Your comment just contains the general consensus I've seen around here.  I know I've bounced around a lot and repeated the same points, so here's a summary of my thoughts   Lirik should be more tactful when addressing comments More effort should be put into those comments to make them constructive and helpful People (And remember these are real people that are on their computers) shouldn't be told to fuck off by the rest of the community if they express concern or distaste for part of the stream However, if you find yourself getting angry at the stream on a daily basis, maybe you should evaluate whether you really do enjoy the stream This is a place for discussion. Not one sided arguments. It's ok if someone disagrees. They are not a moron, they are not haters, they most likely really enjoy the stream. This isn't twitch chat. Stop trying to make every comment a funny one liner.  This has always been a great community. But recently there's been a lot of sub vs sub. Both sides think the other is retarded. We all share a common interest, please, make love not warcraft. Vote for sub sunday FuckWaffle (But don't, I really enjoy night streams)   I'm happy to discuss when I get home, around stream start time."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,66hi3,14,Tue May 12 00:24:39 2015 UTC,I agree. For some reason if you have a different opinion other than what lirik thinks that automatically makes you a retard. It is just an opinion and everyone should be able to state how they feel without sensesly being insulted. Kinda just shows how immature things are taken in this usually wonderful community
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,hunterkiller001,14,Tue May 12 06:33:48 2015 UTC,"Excellent post and I agree with pretty much everything you said.  I have also been watching Lirik for nearly 3 years just like you. I don't recognise your name though and I bet you don't recognise mine. If I've learned anything over the 3 years it is not to post my opinion in chat or here unless I agree with everything Lirik is doing or I'm spamming LirikH. It's a shame it's become that way, but that's just the way it is."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,rcon__,19,Tue May 12 06:42:35 2015 UTC,"Couldn't put it better myself.  That non-argument ""just go watch someone else"" does my fucking head in. The world doesn't work that way. What if Valve's response to the uproar about paid mods was ""just go play something else then""?   People have invested time and money and the minute he starts accepting them, there's a certain obligation. Of course that doesn't mean that everyone should dictate what he does and how he does it, but at least they should be entitled to voice their opinion without fearing they will get banned for it. He can ignore it or not, that is entirely his choice, but there shouldn't be repercussions unless that person is a blatant troll. Because the way this is headed is that he will have chat full of butt kissers that hail and defend every single thing he does while the persons who dare to criticize are called out and shamed (and often banned). Hate to break it to you, but getting yourself in the bubble surrounded by cats with hearts usually doesn't end well when reality eventually hits.   He doesn't need to be shielded from ""all the terrible things"" from the cruel world outside, he should grow some balls and thicker skin, because sometimes when responding to criticisms I get the feeling that I'm watching an insecure 14 year old teenage girl, not a 25 year old man."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,bacje16,4,Tue May 12 08:19:54 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the reply. I appreciate you putting your time into it and caring for the community. I don't disagree with you, my message was more addressed to those who go ""a3l sucks donkey balls"" as I see that to be the majority. You do gotta understand though, you can't change a person. Lirik doesn't exactly go out of his way to run the best community he can. It's impossible to do that with the amount of viewers he has. Let's be real, we all know how Lirik is.... lol."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,annadayz,1 point,Tue May 12 11:21:09 2015 UTC,"This is a prime example of a person who goes out of his way to not be constructive even though some people may agree with him. These are some of the messages he's sent me because he's obviously 12 and has nothing better to do with his time. This is an example of why Lirik hates this subreddit, not people like you doochey, who have a mature response and constructive criticism. The problem with Lirik is that he tends to mute out people who have something proper to say and really focuses on kids, like that guy. I really can see why Lirik gets frustrated, lots of these threads get deleted before a majority sees them but these threads tend to be the majority of this subreddit."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,annadayz,1 point,Tue May 12 22:26:53 2015 UTC,"Wow. I guess thats all I can say to that. Again, I want to express my gratitude to you and the other mods. You deal with that shit daily, so we don't have to.  And I don't really know how that can be fixed. The only option I see is to try and encourage participation. The sub has nearly 8,000 subscribers yet a post struggles to reach 10 comments. Which isn't abnormal for a subreddit this size, but I feel we're better than that. The problem I see is that (at a guess) most of the subscribers made a reddit account just for this sub and do not normally browse reddit. They then proceed to use the sub as a general forum, for questions or funny pictures/video, where the responses can be pretty limited and nothing too insightful. Whether thats what lirik wants or something more in the vain of /r/Games is of course down to him. Like you said, lirik doesn't go out of the way to run the community. He likes to go live, hang out, and then eat. But I think he likes the idea of seeing what his viewers thoughts on things are when they're not limited to a few lines.  The community is ever growing and right now lacks a place to pitch its tent. Obviously twitch is its home, but I don't think it can support it for much longer. We all know some regulars that have faded away. I think the subreddit can be used to reach out to the wider community, the lurkers, and to newbies. People see the speed of chat and get intimidated, they feel their comments aren't seen and their voices not heard. I just feel like we can do better to reach out and welcome new members, embrace them, so that they, in turn, wish to give back, Whether its by subscribing, participating in a discussion, or playing on a sub server.   However I could be overestimating the willingness of the community. We can already see by sub sunday that people are hesitent to interact. But thats what im hoping we can change by setting an example. And if we could get lirik to change his mind and endorse the sub, it would do wonders.  Now, I know you (the mods) do this all for free and are investing your own time. But here are some suggestions.   Set rule list Unless im really stupid (a possibility) I don't see any defined rules. Of course theres the general 'Don't be a douche' rules, that this sub forgets now and again, but without trying to go nazi mod, I propose stricter rules on what can be posted. We don't need multiple posts a day asking for a VOD, or 20 pictures of a fat guy with the title 'Just saw lirik'. If thats what people like then feel free to tell me im wrong guys. Auto Moderator It does amazing things to other subs, or so it seems. I'm not quite sure of the intricacies, but I know it could be set, for example, to remove any post with VOD in the title and post in the comments 'Hey! I think you are searching for a VOD. This is why your post was removed (Rule 6) Have you tried searching the VOD list. If you have, and you think this post should be allowed through, message a mod.' Though, this could create more work for you. An FAQ 'When is lirik streaming' 'What are his pc specs' 'who are the bean bandits' Plenty of questions that can be answered by the info section but making that info more available can't hurt. Also gives something else for auto mod to cite. Post tags This will allow people to filter for the kind of content they want. Just want to look at gifs, bam, heres 10 fat cats. Want to watch some highlights, bam, lirik blowing himself up with a mine. Discussion threads Right now theres only sub sunday and the occaisonal drama thread. A lot of subs have adopted the 'Free talk friday' post. Allowing the community to really talk about whatever while funneling that discussion into one post. Add on something like a 'Week in review' with links to all the weeks VODs and highlights, maybe some big news. And a 'Topic tuesday' where we discuss a particular topic (New emotes, paid mods (The skyrim kind) etc ). Also, live threads. For events like survivor games, it would be cool to have during and post discussion threads.   Again I know you guys are doing this on your own time and it would be more work. But I think it could be a step in turning the subreddit into what lirik invisioned. However I don't know If its possible with 8,000 readers. I'm not trying to tell anyone how to do their job, just being the person I said we should all be.  And sorry for another long post"
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,66hi3,1 point,Wed May 13 16:18:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions on making this subreddit better. I'll make sure to pass it along :)
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,annadayz,1 point,Wed May 13 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"Where else can they go? There are people with genuine criticisms that want to make the stream better. Are they supposed to try and voice that in chat? So they can get banned and told that their own mother doesn't like them? At least here they can post behind another alias.   The assumption made here is that this subreddit is a place filled with constructive criticism, which I'd argue it isn't. If it were heavily moderated it might become what you're describing, and then things would be different. But as it stands thigns are they way they are for a reason."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,ingenious28,0,Wed May 13 22:02:01 2015 UTC,Wow an actual logical argument instead of cry babies on the internet
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,loolwut,4,Tue May 12 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"I don't want to take anyone's side in this matter, so this isn't directed to either side, just a general opinion.  Lirik has always played whatever he feels like, and that has worked out for him, obviously. It's when he's having fun that he's the most entertaining, and since his channel is only growing in popularity he should stick with it since why would you change a winning concept?  Altough at the same time, i think it's important that we as viewers, as consumers, are able to discuss the content of the stream. There's always things that the streamer can improve but that he/she might not always realize him/herself and that's why it's important that the viewers are able to at least share their viewpoint, even though it might not be right, or even though the streamer might disagree. If there ever is a general consensus on something that should be improved, then it's important that the viewers feel like they can share their opinion without fear of retaliation or punishment, provided that they have solid arguments.  That's also why i think that Lirik should at least read the subreddit even though he might not agree with what is said here. He runs a business, and so far it has worked out, but if it ever begins to start heading downwards then the consumers advice might help, and that's why it's good that we have an active community forum such as this subreddit.  I do not however support the circle-jerking, on either side. I support having discussions provided with arguments, constructive criticism.   This subreddit has helped him out in the past. Without it, he might've not talked to zhrooms (the guy who helped him with his computer) because if I recall, the guy had tried contacting Lirik previously about it but either Lirik hadn't seen it or just dismissed it, but with support from this community the guy was able to get his word out and Lirik got a beast computer as a result.   Constructive criticism should not be taken as that the viewers are ""entitled"". People obviously care, otherwise they wouldn't voice their opinion and they shouldn't be shunned because of it. Stop focusing on the negative, and think of how this can help instead.  With all that said, I do think we should keep criticism out of chat, because that's a time where everyone should just enjoy the stream and rather voice their opinions here where you can actually have a discussion.  Sorry for the ranting, you might think that I'm talking out of my ass and that's fine, at least I got to share my viewpoint as a normal viewer which is all I'm asking for.   Love the stream and this community, keep it up!"
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,swirreftw,0,Tue May 12 16:44:47 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty obvious to turn off the stream and watch something else if you don't like it.  That's what I do when he plays something I just can't enjoy watching.
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,draanexle,0,Tue May 12 12:05:22 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that you can do that, but some people would rather whine about it in chat, or in this subreddit. Those are the people that make the community shit."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,annadayz,-2,Tue May 12 06:29:48 2015 UTC,I'll never understand Reddit. A place where people who love something the most go to push that something further away.
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,arclegger,13,Tue May 12 22:30:34 2015 UTC,"Arc please. Whilst I understand why you might say that in respect of the H1Z1 reddit, although it's been painful to read at times, I think the H1Z1 subreddit has ""helped"" to keep you guys honest and heading in the right direction. You guys have shown fortitude by sifting through the circlejerking and listening where it matters and to be brutally honest, Lirik could learn something from that approach IMO."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,rcon__,2,Tue May 12 05:48:21 2015 UTC,"i agree with what you're saying, and the general idea that the subreddit shouldn't be removing posts or shitting on people just because they want to give feedback, but at the same time i don't like seeing people constantly harassing lirik and trying to shove their own personal ideas of how the stream should be run down his throat.  i like that he doesn't give a fuck, doesn't pander to subs, and plays what he wants. i used to watch manvsgame for years, but stopped when his stream slowly degraded into 90% thanking subs/donators and 10% playing games, always being as politically correct as possible, and not speaking his mind. i hope lirik doesn't succumb to incessant whiny demands and go down that path."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,slowpotamus,1 point,Tue May 12 10:22:07 2015 UTC,What part do you guys not understand? Lirik is Lirik. He dosnt have to learn anything outside of what hes going to learn anyways.

DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,onemanmanywomen,8,Tue May 12 04:26:35 2015 UTC,"I see your point, there is a lot of rubbish that goes on in this subreddit. But tbh, this is one of the only places people can voice their concerns. Yes it was done in a bad fashion. I wasn't lirikHype about the 2 replacement emotes, its Lirik's channel so its his choice. Maybe constructive criticism only should be something we take forward."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,ingenious28,5,Mon May 11 21:15:46 2015 UTC,"I think a major chord thats being stuck in here and many other threads is the idea of a community, which I've always found a bit odd. There are many examples of fantastic streamers who have grown by fostering this notion (Cohh comes to mind) and have put in time, money and effort into supporting this digital foorprint through online forums and con appearearnces and such.   This is something really unique to twitch because of it's personal nature. But it's obviously not true of most forms of entertainment. Just because others have chosen to go that specific route doesn't mean it's the mandatory or even best path to go down. This is, at least for me, the reason why I tend to view many folks as being ""entitled.""  Obviously Lirik didn't take that route to become as large as he did. If the dude whats to be more hands off, I'd say that's up him. If his viewers want to come together and build some sort of community, I think we can all see the difficultly that brings without having a strong vision or oversight (lots of bitching, no focus, no real constructive progression on ideas, a little bit of anarchy and vitriol). This is because the vocal minority really gets exasterbated and skews the views of the silent majority.  At the end of the day, you can either enjoy things the way they are, put effort in to change or create new outlets that you feel better reflects this community, or simply turn the channel (or maybe start your own channel)."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,loolwut,10,Mon May 11 21:18:17 2015 UTC,i just laughed at his comment. really immature. ive been watching him less and less as of late
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,ingenious28,-2,Tue May 12 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"lol. guy who doesn't care yet is in this subreddit responging to comments. this is his buisness, he gets to choose how he wants to run it. i don't see how him not wanting to put attention into his subreddit makes him immature. he does shit with the community (sub sundays, hotline for awhile, gaming servers, etc.)."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,hunterkiller001,4,Mon May 11 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear Lirik views the stream as his stream, and he may or may not care for your ""advice"". Not really surprising. On the other hand, people here seem to think they have some sort of power or relevance, that they are somehow important to the stream, that they should be listened to. Why?"
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,Limelol,5,Tue May 12 02:03:46 2015 UTC,I've been watching lirik for awhile now and I am also getting tired of the way he treats us subs. Before I thought it was funny but now it's getting old... I'm even afraid to type in chat because I'll get banned for stating my own opinion:/
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,ClottedTampon,4,Tue May 12 02:04:15 2015 UTC,"Huh? This subreddit has been pretty tame lately. I missed it in his stream, but did he say that there's still an ongoing problem? Sure, we get a few bad apples every now and then, but it's just a small aspect of this community.  I can only think of 1 thread recently that got out of hand and should've been nuked by a mod."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,meandyouandyouandme,2,Tue May 12 06:50:21 2015 UTC,"For some reason I remember him saying about two years ago that he didn't want the stream to go above 2k viewers because chat always got too crazy. I know the reason I hardly ever type in chat any more is because there are literally thousands of people who I don't know and it's a lot harder to keep track of people's personalities/names than it was when I first got into the stream.   Stream wise though it's still great viewing any time you tune in, people just need to stop complaining about free entertainment. There are literally hundreds of streams on Twitch that people can choose from and expecting anyone to stream based on one person or a small minorities preference is unfair.  Keep in mind that we only notice the trolls that he responds to. He must get so much shit from people that only he sees (let's face it, it's the fucking internet, it doesn't come with an IQ test) that I think he deserves a blow up every now and then. Not saying it's the best way to deal with it but at the same time I don't think you can blame him for it."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,stjunk,11,Mon May 11 21:32:04 2015 UTC,"Most of the time it seems like he simply doesn't get twitch chat. Twitch is has retarded vocal minority, instead of ignoring it like any other streamer does, Lirik likes to hide behind his subchat and have his mod ban every single one of them and good guys with him."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,ajaxwow,2,Mon May 11 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"don't fully understand this thread, of course the subreddit won't be full of ""i love you senpai"" 24/7 because ass licking already goes on 24/7 in his stream, and of course lirik loves the money even if you/him question it but he has made so much off you guys that even he can say he plays purely for the stream because he's already got a good income and that won't change any time soon.  like ""sub sunday posts from that guy"" i think their should be a constant update of ""vods update not of arma's/a3ls but unique games he does not play often so people can find a game they like.  emotes wise i get the impression he wants himself to be known and not the cats but thats only lately but cats are love/life ect.  ah yeah and i guess he does seem mean to subs, he can afford to lose people tho it's just like i mentioned with the money so i won't bother with that.  all i can think of at the moment."

DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,hunterkiller001,1 point,Tue May 12 16:13:25 2015 UTC,"What you people are missing is that Lirik doesn't view it as a business, yes we give him money through subscriptions and donations but at the end of the day he streams because he enjoys playing games.  As soon as we take his ability to choose his own games to play, streaming becomes less fun for him and the streams would get shit - I pay my subscription to show appreciation, not to have influence over what games he plays. Personally it should stay this way.  Lirik's personality shows a love-hate relationship with the chat and rightly so. Some of the fuckwits in chat can't make lirik proud but there's other times where Lirik likes his chat. It's a two way street but it's what makes Lirik, well Lirik."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,Portrend,4,Tue May 12 16:47:42 2015 UTC,I agree that people shouldn't tell lirik what to play. It's his stream he can play whatever the fuck he wants   But the love/hate relationship has gotten a bit too serious with the hate at times it's getting old
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,hunterkiller001,-1,Tue May 12 07:07:22 2015 UTC,"If it's getting old move on and find a new stream - It's the bottom line really.  Lirik is popular because he does what he does, he's not going to change because a small minority are feeling upset with how he treats them. The only person who has means to moan is UI20, Lirik gives him some shit."
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,Portrend,2,Tue May 12 07:17:24 2015 UTC,I do watch other streams... You act as if you can only watch one? Telling someone to just not watch the stream is the only thing people like you have to say. That's like telling lirik if he doesn't like constructive critisism to stop streaming...
DatGuyLirik,35n1qz,ReadingNotAllowed,0,Tue May 12 09:11:20 2015 UTC,"No, it's more that Lirik does what he wants on his channel - We don't subscribe for someone we can shape and mould into what each of us want, we subscribe follow and watch him to see how he acts in certain games and his reactions and sense of humour is what drives almost 10,000 subscriptions.  I accept for a big channel possibly constructive criticism shouldn't be forbidden as such however, if you're doing your stream on the basis of ""I'm a gamer and I like streaming so people can watch ME play"" why would you change because others tell you to?   It just seems as if people are going about it as if Lirik actually cares if you pay or not. He could go FULL sellout mode and push people to subscribe, push people to donate and he doesn't. He plays the games he likes and enjoys and if on the off-chance we like them woo-hoo, but when we don't that's still not our call to tell him how to play his game and how he should run his channel.  TL;DR - Lirik has full control and if he enjoys it and isn't bothered about the 'brand' of his channel, he doesn't need to change/listen to criticism no matter how constructive."

DatGuyLirik,35lt92,Malkuno,2,Mon May 11 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"Twitch REAAALLYY needs to do a PSA to let people know they can directly link to a certain part of a VOD by adding a timestamp like the following (?t= H (Hours), M (Minutes), S (Seconds)) or add an option to timestamp the VOD link youtube has, Because right now Hardly anyone knows you can link directly to a certain part of a VOD.  EXAMPLE: http://www.twitch.tv/lirik/v/4466599?t=6h24m30s  I see far too many people on multiple different subreddits linking VODs after someone requests something & then telling them to skip to X time. I don't blame the people for not knowing, I blame twitch for not really advertising this extremely helpful feature aswell as they could.  That being said, I hope more people help spread the word!"

DatGuyLirik,35lt92,Nikczemny,1 point,Tue May 12 00:34:46 2015 UTC,"I mean i agree with you, but all of those RP actions can not be shown in game so they have to say stuff like that.

Especially involving money and especially involving people online. Not to say anything bad to Lirik, he's a pretty stand up guy. But always be careful when dealing with streamers, some in the past have even pocked money and ran. Or faked injuries for sympathy donations.   But yeah, agreed. Always do research!"

DatGuyLirik,35i9un,Nemoswang,1 point,Fri May 15 12:59:32 2015 UTC,"He did come back to twitch, he streamed for like a week then fucked off until Season 3 started in D3. He streamed the first couple couple days of S3 then did the old 'my internet provider is down' thing he does every month and hasn't streamed or given any explanation as to why he stopped streaming on his twitter. He also deleted all VoDs and highlights  edit: from his twitter: Giggerino will be back soon. Get ready for many surprises (both good & bad).  Will be worth watching just to see what his excuse is for keeping all his fans/subs/donators in the dark for so long"

DatGuyLirik,35i9un,JPili,5,Mon May 11 11:09:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you're saying here but you can't really blame Lirik... Lirik do research? lol pls. Someone should recommend a really good charity to Lirik and have a good explanation as to why he should sponsor that specific charity. And don't just say ""Oh this charity is better just because"" because we all know Lirik's gonna tell you to fuck off."
DatGuyLirik,35i9un,rcon__,1 point,Mon May 11 06:34:58 2015 UTC,"I know. But I don't think he will react childish and impulsive, if you give him good arguments. Anyway, it seems like he is one of those person's who donate to charities around them. If you look for the biggest impact of your money and effectiveness, you should donate to Africa. (SaveTheChildren has projects for the aftermath of Ebola) You can literally save a child's life with 10 bucks. On the other hand you pay a doctor in the US for maybe 30 minutes with the same money."
DatGuyLirik,35i9un,tylerx88,3,Mon May 11 09:37:42 2015 UTC,"Whilst I don't doubt that you made your post with good intentions and that you are mostly correct in what you say, I think you are missing the whole point of why Lirik chooses to support the Extra Life organisation over countless others.  ""Extra Life Org: Play Games. Heal Kids.""  As a life long gamer I find that a very powerful tag line, not least because I've been lucky enough to have a life, some of these kids might not.  Extra Life is in my opinion a brilliant idea and of course fits Lirik (a games streamer) like a glove. It's not just about eeking out every last cent of value, as important as that is, it's also about reaching out to people who might not otherwise donate. Extra Life though gaming is something that Lirik and more importantly his viewers can immediately relate too and most importantly, support."

DatGuyLirik,35i9un,Ervori,2,Mon May 11 13:54:28 2015 UTC,"You are interpreting his attitude wrongly. The idea of a charity stream is to make a difference and motivate people to donate / spread the word around an important cause. If Lirik reaches 1 guy who ownes millions of dollars, who decides to donate because of the stream, then that would have a bigger impact then Lirik donating whatever amount."
DatGuyLirik,35i9un,busfullofjews,2,Mon May 11 16:11:08 2015 UTC,"@hate4fun i get what you're saying but the image lirik is giving out is not positive, ""i want all of you to donate but i won't donate"" sends a bad image but if even the streamer is in on it than that pumps others to do it instead of just streaming a event because you want in on a arma survival game."
DatGuyLirik,35i9un,JPili,1 point,Tue May 12 09:01:01 2015 UTC,"hm, I thought he has his reasons. Did he ever say, why he didn't want to take part, besides hosting the event on his stream?"

DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,JPili,6,Sat May 9 06:41:41 2015 UTC,"The new 900p streaming setup disrupts my Chromecast viewing . I think the Chromecast can't handle the bitrate. It really SUCKS, because I always have Lirik on on my Chromecast.  With the new bitrate, the Chromecast cuts off with the audio, and audio lags a lot.  I know this is a Chromecast issue, but I don't think they'll ever solve this :("
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,davidhero,3,Sat May 9 10:54:55 2015 UTC,Twitch also only allows a max of 3500 bitrate. 1080p with a bitrate of 3500 won't always look that great with 60fps. 30fps it would probably be fine.   Also as mentioned if someone is streaming at 3500 that means in theory that the viewers need at least 3.5MBs down.
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,makint,4,Sat May 9 07:23:43 2015 UTC,"3500 is in bits not bytes.... so it'd only be about 0.5 MB/s   Also if someone doesn't have fast enough speed, they can always watch on high. But yeah I now understand the limitations of Twitch as to why 1080p won't work. Thanks for telling me about the max bitrate thing :)"
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,Jack-O7,3,Sat May 9 07:26:52 2015 UTC,"Have you seen the image quality at High, it's almost unwatchable on a 1080p monitor. I honestly wouldn't watch the stream if i was limited to high."

DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,MrZappa8,2,Sat May 9 15:47:27 2015 UTC,I have 50 mbps and source can still buffer for me sometimes. It's just twitch
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,spencermehta,2,Sat May 9 08:27:19 2015 UTC,"That's either because of your connection to Twitch, unstable link provided by ISP or ISP throttling your connection to certain high-bandwidth sites"
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,nys0,2,Sat May 9 11:48:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I have a feeling it's the ISP.  For me, Twitch is impossible to watch during the day cause speed while on the site is pretty much nonexistent with the speed getting unthrottled around 10 PM. (Just in time for Lorik's stream :3) I'm planning on complaining sometime this week. Fuck ISPs, amitrite?"
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,Larryx123,2,Sat May 9 12:26:20 2015 UTC,"That limit only applies to huge streamers. For example, Bikeman averages at around 1.5k viewers and he is allowed to stream at 5000 bitrate. Although the official limit is 3500, twitch partners can go above that limit, unless the extra load in the twitch servers is noticeable, then staff will tell them to lower it.  Since Lirik averages at around 25-30k viewers it is not manageable to stream with a more than 3500 bitrate. He has said that from times to times he experiences it with 4000 but anything higher than that will result in TheGunRun, telling him to lower it because it starts overloading the servers."
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,SLVRRR,1 point,Sat May 9 11:34:24 2015 UTC,"Dayum... What the fuck is Amazon doing?... If they're gonna invest in Twitch, then they should invest in some more servers :/"
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,SLVRRR,3,Sat May 9 12:33:09 2015 UTC,"3500 bitrate (the highest on twitch) is not enough to support 1080p, 60fps. So you either give up on the fps and stream in 30, or downscale to 900p. It just looks better."
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,loolwut,1 point,Sat May 9 08:18:45 2015 UTC,Yeah man.. It really sucks.. When do you think Twitch is gonna raise the bit rate limit?
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,MooseontheInterstate,2,Sat May 9 12:29:33 2015 UTC,"Never(virtually). They have been running on low specs forever and the viewers/broadcasters don't complain enough. Higher bitrate requires more servers, and those are expensive, so they won't do that.  Instead viewers complain about flash and cry for HTML5 like little sheep because they heard John praise it. Little do they know HTML5 is gonna do jackshit for them."
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,nys0,2,Sat May 9 17:50:32 2015 UTC,"I think that's our cue to start a petition for more servers   I'm kinda serious, though."
DatGuyLirik,35dgtk,bloodspore,2,Sun May 10 08:41:06 2015 UTC,"You will never get enough people to support this, sadly. Even the big broadcasters don't know about this issue. Lirik still thinks going over 4000 bitrate would hurt him, when really even half a potato would be enough to leech a 5000 or even 7000 bitrate stream. (plus, twitch can always transcode down for you)"

Other streams worth checking out are Richard Hammer's stream, he mainly plays Isaac and he tells very entertaining stories about his life but he streams very late for me, Lethal Frag has also a very pleasant stream but he plays some games that are super boring to watch so depends if you're in the mood for that.

DatGuyLirik,35bn7d,DRNippler,1 point,Sat May 9 06:27:37 2015 UTC,"There is a 3500 kb/s hard limit on Twitch. Doing 1080p requires a lot of compression, which is why the stream looked like shit yesterday IMHO. I liked the 900p stream more."
DatGuyLirik,35bn7d,DRNippler,2,Sat May 9 12:29:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I just recently heard about the 3500 limit... Sucks balls.. Amazon needs to step up their game and buy more servers.
DatGuyLirik,35bn7d,DRNippler,1 point,Sat May 9 12:35:43 2015 UTC,"I agree that the 3500 kb/s limit is too low. Game streams have a lot of detail and motion, which require less compression to display in a proper manner. But that limit is probably bandwidth related, not server related.  Lirik's stream for example, has ~30.000 viewers at a given time. Streaming to these people @ 3500kb/s requires a 105 gigabit/second or a 13 gigabytes/second pipeline to function. Upgrading to 5000 kb/s bitrate would increase that amount to 150 gigabit/second or 19 gigabytes/second. That is a huge amount of data.   The Twitch server 'only' does transcoding for the flash player and the various quality options. Upscaling to a 5000 kb/s bitrate would have some impact on that system, but it wouldn't need such a massive upgrade in order to function properly."
DatGuyLirik,35bn7d,xZneak,1 point,Sat May 9 13:00:41 2015 UTC,So you're saying the problem is that Twitch needs to buy more bandwidth?...
DatGuyLirik,35bn7d,byKonzii,1 point,Sat May 9 15:03:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know the ins and outs of the twitch infrastructure, but yes. They would have to buy bandwidth from their hosting party or buy equipment to handle the increased data output. Bandwidth on this type of scale is cheap, but increasing bandwidth by 50% would still cost a significant amount of money."

DatGuyLirik,35615l,OddFriend,13,Thu May 7 14:25:28 2015 UTC,That doesn't really matter. A moving picture is always going to look worse than a screengrab. Negative visuals will stand out way more.
DatGuyLirik,35615l,BobbyPzz,-4,Thu May 7 14:46:03 2015 UTC,"You high m8? Most of the time screen shots always look shitter than in game footage unless they are edited. Yes there are the occasional good shots that make the game look better, like this one because of the way the rain is and sht. But most of the time screen shots look worse because you can point out the negative visuals easier while not being immersed in the game."

DatGuyLirik,35615l,rushad88,1 point,Thu May 7 16:19:28 2015 UTC,"Lirik sees his game in 1440p, he uses OBS with encoding disabled which downscales the 1440p to 1080p then it goes onto his streaming pc (What we see on stream) which is downscaled to 1536x864.

DatGuyLirik,352ydc,Satanish,13,Wed May 6 17:44:26 2015 UTC,It also has to do with the fact that he's one of the only people that can break the rules and not get banned.
DatGuyLirik,352ydc,honeybirddew,1 point,Thu May 7 00:55:01 2015 UTC,"Not implying that your wrong, but what are some examples? I'm not that familiar with the rules of A3L."

DatGuyLirik,352ydc,Goldenkidney,7,Thu May 7 05:08:49 2015 UTC,"Yup, A3L cant afford to ban Lirik, Critical Gaming already has more players daily."
DatGuyLirik,352ydc,Larryx123,3,Thu May 7 07:56:42 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but I've been watching A3L for a while now. It seems to happen more often that people, including cops, get ran over in a green zone due to a sudden need to escape the situation. I think this kind of situation is different than a blatant VDM for no reason.   Sure, the person who got ran over might get salty for a bit, but I think it's very rare that people get into trouble over accidentally running someone over in the heat of the moment.  Of course it's also not really his intent to break the rules. Some of the things that did seem sketchy, seemed to be more of a grey area, and would require a really salty person to actually try to get Lirik into trouble for.   Doesn't mean that the A3L admins don't give him the benefit of the doubt every now and then, but they also know that Lirik tries his best and doesn't break the rules on purpose."

Overall it is a pretty good game, but for me it was a bit too simple, the combat kinda got stale after a while and the megazord fights got stale pretty fast. I think it lacked rpg elements ( you can only get one skill per season and equip things on your rangers and thats pretty much all there was to it on the rpg part). The teamwork feature on the combat is pretty unique I've never seen in a tactical rpg before which was pretty cool. The humor is not my type as well, they made so many silly bosses and I think they could've pulled of some much cooler looking bosses instead of stuff like 'Transitmancer' which I didn't mind THAT much. The graphics I thought were super cool I love those types of graphics. Another issue for me is that it didn't have any keyboard shortcuts, neither had their past game Knights of pen and paper which I liked as well. I think chroma squad is a pretty good game, but it could've been so much better in my opinion."

DatGuyLirik,34rrd8,dissentience,3,Mon May 4 01:50:19 2015 UTC,hes just giving suggestions no need to be a whiteknight. And lirik has said himself ON stream that a format like this (some $$$ per death donated to a charity) was allowed.
DatGuyLirik,34rrd8,xiiam,1 point,Mon May 4 14:46:43 2015 UTC,"Wasn't really trying to whiteknight, was just repeating what Lirik has already said. I had not heard him say that he was interested in that format of charity donations, though, so I retract my statement. :)"
DatGuyLirik,34rrd8,dissentience,1 point,Mon May 4 17:15:41 2015 UTC,Don't know why people are getting so worked up on a idea. its like they are married with the guy or something. I'm quite shocked.
DatGuyLirik,34rrd8,anaveragecomment,-4,Mon May 4 23:54:10 2015 UTC,Why would he play a bad game and donate to a country that has no effect on him
DatGuyLirik,34rrd8,sivyan,9,Mon May 4 01:51:28 2015 UTC,I don't like OP'S idea either but your reasoning is stupid
DatGuyLirik,34rrd8,Portrend,0,Mon May 4 05:05:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good idea the whole charity thing, but Lirik already dedicates himself to Extra Life - He's said himself he doesn't want to become a sellout to charities, despite their noble causes, and it's probably right to take this stance.  +1 for idea, -1 for trying to tell Senpai what to do."

DatGuyLirik,34nvhc,stjunk,2,Sun May 3 10:14:44 2015 UTC,I think Lirik wants more subs to vote so the subs actually show they want SS. What I think is that LOADS of subs don't know what to vote for or they don't really care what Lirik plays as long as he streams.  The reason why it's random is so games with only 1 vote can be picked as well (eventhough low% chance).

DatGuyLirik,34jp4h,onemanmanywomen,82,Fri May 1 21:31:18 2015 UTC,I agree. Just because he doesn't play dayz mod anymore doesn't mean he has to remove all his emotes from those days. The new emotes suck.
DatGuyLirik,34jp4h,Brightwaters,28,Fri May 1 19:11:40 2015 UTC,This. New emotes look like they are taken from japanese anime. They dont fit the channel at all. I loved cats emotes and i still do but i refuse to use all the new emotes.

DatGuyLirik,34jp4h,StrainRelated,8,Sat May 2 07:08:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if he wants to change it up, it's his decision. As to taking our word into consideration, I believe a lot of people like the new one, only a handful hangs out in this sub and complains about them.  I don't care much for the emotes, myself, if you dont like them, then do not look at chat if they are so upsetting?   Also, he listens to our words, that is the reason why we have subsunday."

I'll probably still use it for all the fail things said in stream but definitely worse then the original emote.

DatGuyLirik,34jp4h,Diaghre,1 point,Sat May 2 16:20:16 2015 UTC,"Well, see, sub emotes have very little to do with what the STREAMER him/herself likes or wants, they are a part of the incentive for people to subscribe. If people won't like them = less incentive for them to sub = less subs in general. So there's absolutely nothing wrong with the viewers complaining about them and the streamer should definitely listen to their feedback ;-)"
DatGuyLirik,34jp4h,AlexusN,3,Wed May 6 01:37:12 2015 UTC,please i subbed to Lirik for Lirik not the emotes
DatGuyLirik,34jp4h,Arkwoman1990,4,Wed May 6 02:13:31 2015 UTC,"If you sub for emotes and not to simply support Lirik, you're borderline retarded."
DatGuyLirik,34jp4h,Drayzen,2,Sat May 2 23:48:34 2015 UTC,I also didn't like the new emotes very much when I first saw them. Iconic? Maybe. But now I already got used to them. I think it will be just a matter of time till you guys get used to them too.
DatGuyLirik,34jp4h,M3trO_,1 point,Sun May 3 03:26:16 2015 UTC,"The more detail (shadows, shading etc.) you try to put in an emote the more difficult it is to see what the emote actually is. The emotes would probably look a lot better if they were bigger but you've got to work with just a few pixels."
DatGuyLirik,34jp4h,koen092,1 point,Sun May 3 14:09:31 2015 UTC,lol dont use them if you dont like them. no one is forcing you to use them. stop complaining about ever single thing. change is good. if you dont change you become stagnate and ppl think you dont care anymore.

DatGuyLirik,34mavr,Arkwoman1990,1 point,Sat May 2 17:09:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything about him buying different headphones.  Regarding your question, the dt770 are closed and the dt990 are open. The dt770 isolate the sound around you meaning that will be very difficult to hear people or any other noises, while the dt990 let you hear people talking and stuff happening in your room. While they have the same basic hardware, these differences in the cups result in differences in the way they sound. For a more comprehensive analysis go here.  If you have more questions I would advise you to do some research on head-fi and innerfidelity."
DatGuyLirik,34mavr,nys0,1 point,Sat May 2 14:53:08 2015 UTC,"the DT990's (owner myself) sound very ""fun"" compared to the 770's. I have both and enjoy the 990 way more"

DatGuyLirik,34mavr,Luask,1 point,Sat May 2 15:54:07 2015 UTC,"he's using beyerdynamic dt770 afaik, and he recently bought a new pair. i bought dt990s recently and they are actually really good. main difference between the two models is the fact that dt990 have open cans, meaning you can still hear thing around you when you have them on. that's a pretty neat feature if you're paranoid about someone breaking into your house while you're just chilling with your headphones on. shit's scary if you actually think about it"
DatGuyLirik,34mavr,batula,1 point,Sat May 2 16:11:36 2015 UTC,"just FYI the 990 aren't better because the number is higher. The 770 are closed and the 990 are open. 95% of the people would prefer closed in direct comparison because closed headphones are better for music that almost everybody hears. also open = you will hear everything around you and this is really annoying because you can never focus on the music/game. closed = pure sound/music, much stronger bass, everything more intensive. I would recommend you the 770. (Sorry for bad london)"

DatGuyLirik,34e0qz,draanexle,6,Thu Apr 30 14:02:35 2015 UTC,After watching the stream all week I am going to buy Rust today. I remember when he used to play it and it was terrible with hackers and you just got spawn killed over and over in an ugly game. It looks like it has come quite a long way and I think it would be fun to try out at the current stage that it is in. If only DayZ shown this kind of visible progress.
DatGuyLirik,34e0qz,ThisIsReLLiK,2,Thu Apr 30 14:42:27 2015 UTC,I will just wait until it's officially released.  I've learned my lesson from DayZ.

DatGuyLirik,34c8va,AnibalSRX,7,Thu Apr 30 00:09:24 2015 UTC,"they did a great job on the new soundtrack, but I personally liked the old sound track more.  It just seems more epic after the break and the logo was pulsating.  this is pretty good and I like how the jet explosion has sound versus the sound que on him waving his hands in the parachute.  ps: also sort of like the new sound track when climbing the tower with lettuce cat  good job"
DatGuyLirik,34c8va,h2oYo,2,Thu Apr 30 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude, Skwazzle did a great job syncing everything up."
DatGuyLirik,34c8va,FreakishAlloy6,3,Thu Apr 30 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"stopped halfway, the song has it's moments but in general it doesn't fit with the video.  personally with the emotes and such, i think the intro should of gone by a cuter direction.. perhaps the protagonist being Lettuce Cat?   instead of the human we'll call lirik.. being at A - X games it should be a bunch of stuff going on with LirikL witnessing it all, before returning through the animal door and jumping onto the desk just as Lirik sits down to prepare for the stream as if.. LirikL/Luna has this whole other life?   just random brainstorming.. the new intro also ends to abrupt."
DatGuyLirik,34c8va,stjunk,1 point,Fri May 1 08:36:53 2015 UTC,"The intro doesn't feel authentic at all.  The facial expressions and the movement don't feel natural to me.  Whenever I watch it, I feel awkward."
DatGuyLirik,34c8va,KKona123,2,Fri May 1 11:42:17 2015 UTC,This version is a lot better IMO.
DatGuyLirik,34c8va,VickFVM,0,Thu Apr 30 08:01:18 2015 UTC,Do you guys not think that this intro is cringe?  It has some really unnatural movements in it.   The facial expressions look awkward as well. Just my 2 cent
DatGuyLirik,34c8va,KKona123,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:11:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not a fan either. It just doesn't feel like an intro to me, more like a fan movie.  In any case, the old music is better but I don't think it syncs well with the video. ""Drops"" in the music are off with movement and scene changes. It could possibly work with some video editing (e.g. the first drop should be when character jumps off the cliff and the next one when the camera shows him on the dragon's back before it dives, so video should be cut for about a second or so in between), but there would probably be copyright issues if someone just started slicing their product.  Lirik could probably ask them to include that music and fix the video appropriately, but I doubt he'd be willing to."
DatGuyLirik,34c8va,bacje16,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean the music / movement. The face of the actor is so derpy. Whenever he laughs, it looks so cringeworthy.   For example: when he drops out of the jet with the parachute, he is so happy, that his jet crashed. He even puts up his arms, like he is in disney world.   Or when he is on the car with the flame thrower. He is the happiest person on earth, setting people on fire and smelling their burned flesh.  The maker of this intro must have been on weed. The smile of the animated person isn't authentic at all. They didn't spend enough time on it or Lirik did just not demand the right thing. I can imagine what he told the 3d animators:    'Make it 60fps, put games in it and cats'"
DatGuyLirik,34c8va,KKona123,2,Fri May 1 11:24:52 2015 UTC,"No shit he looks happy. The protagonist is supposed to be the viewer, and him going through the different environments is the viewer being brought along for the ride in every game Lirik plays.  I personally love the intro but with the original music, the Audiomachine song doesn't fit with it at all."

DatGuyLirik,34dbsu,CaptainBeer_,2,Fri May 1 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"Wow... That got quite some negative response here :(.  I love the emotes! They look very clean and modern compared to the old versions. Also I think they fit the other emotes better than the old versions did. They are very colorful and cute, which is what Lirik's emotes are about in my opinion.  Also the reason it looks like it's from a ""childrens manga"" is because it is made in a Chibi-style. Chibi emotes are based on being modeled after a small manga/anime child with a (proportionally) big head. I think it fits the Lirik theme quite well myself, but I guess it's just an opinion."

DatGuyLirik,34b9bk,koen092,25,Wed Apr 29 19:48:55 2015 UTC,my theory is that DasMehdi has Lirik locked up in a room in the house and occasionally feeds him (that is when you hear the door slam).

DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,philphilphil,9,Wed Apr 29 16:47:39 2015 UTC,I have noticed that to. Someone donated talking about the adds and he just said wtf are you talking about.
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,phooez,7,Wed Apr 29 17:58:23 2015 UTC,I recommend http://livestreamer.tanuki.se Its an CommandLineTool and you can watch streams in VLC with it and there is no Ads and way better performance than this Twitch-Flashplayer shit. (Ofc i subbed to Support Twitch and Lirik)
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,Torktumlaren,2,Wed Apr 29 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"yup, and then just create .bat file on desktop   @echo cd c:\program files (x86)\livestreamer livestreamer.exe --hls-segment-threads 5 twitch.tv/lirik best @echo off"

If I had the biggest(aside from events) stream on twitch, I would probably play a few ads here and there as well. Then again, the revenue for 10K subs+donations is more than enough to make up for not playing ads at all. Not sure how I would handle it actually."
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,Blayton13,4,Tue May 5 21:48:03 2015 UTC,This is Twitch pushing adds on mobile/tablets. Nothing to do with lirik.
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,LarryFromSupraball,0,Wed Apr 29 18:40:14 2015 UTC,"""This ads support LIRIK"" means the broadcaster played the ads. ""This ads support TWITCH"" means twitch played the ads."
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,draanexle,2,Wed Apr 29 22:52:59 2015 UTC,They actually patched that.
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,draanexle,7,Thu Apr 30 00:09:04 2015 UTC,Just use AdBlock
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,draanexle,4,Thu Apr 30 00:28:14 2015 UTC,I watch on Xbox one so that's not an option unfortunately
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,JPsynergy,3,Thu Apr 30 03:13:11 2015 UTC,"Twitch Turbo or Subscribe to him, stay logged in?  Idk though.  Also, how come you watch on Xbox? Just curious."
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,IJudgePCBuilds,4,Wed Apr 29 16:31:25 2015 UTC,"May end up just subscribing, sure have lurked long enough..  I watch on Xbox because I work from my living room. I turn lirik on my big screen using the Xbox and work off my laptop on the couch. It's nice background noise. I guess that is why I notice the ads more too, because I literally have him playing just about all day long."
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,Arkwoman1990,3,Wed Apr 29 16:56:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, understandable.  Well, idk then. I'm just using adblock. The amount of money ads generate is extremely small anyways.  On Xbox I'm pretty sure you can't get adblock, so you'll most likely have to subscribe or get twitch turbo if you want to watch Lirik without ads.  Twitch turbo removes ads from the whole site, so if you watch other stuff on Twitch then turbo is better."
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,bacje16,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"I'm looking into twitch turbo, honestly didn't even realize this was a thing. I'd love to support lirik as well though. Not that he needs it lol"

DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,blizzlewizzle,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:59:38 2015 UTC,Seriously though use adblock and if you like a stream sub/donate to it. Even YouTube is moving to a system where you can pay to take away ads.

DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,Shadowsgg,5,Thu Apr 30 02:26:11 2015 UTC,It is xbox/twitch throwing the ads. Not lirik.
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,E38V12,4,Thu Apr 30 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"I considered that as a possibility, but it seems more people are getting ads on mobile as well"
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,TheEPICBoot,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:32:06 2015 UTC,"I've gotten ads on mobile even when watching streamers that aren't partnered. I think Twitch just plays more ads on mobile/xbox, that are out of the streamers control. May not be the case here though."
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,Cumpilation,2,Wed Apr 29 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"I don't really care that he does ads, its just weird how he puts it into sub mode and does not acknowledge the fact ads are being played."
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,Bowden11,2,Wed Apr 29 18:56:18 2015 UTC,"I would guess it has something to do with the fact that he goes in sub only mode pretty early on the stream and twitch forces ads through streams. At least thats always anoyed me, without adblock i get ads every 30 min or so."
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,Shadowsgg,2,Wed Apr 29 22:15:02 2015 UTC,not using ad blocker in 2000+10+2+3
DatGuyLirik,34ai0j,Bowden11,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"Sure, let's all use adblock and make sure the internet isn't profitable to content creators anymore, so everything will be put behind a paywall. Makes me sad that  so many people don't get this."

It makes sense; if you watch the games he enjoys and the ones that he thinks are boring; he's really not the kind that would appreciate huge walls of roleplaying text, even if the writing and immersion is incredible. So that excludes all of the awesome CRPG's. I also think what the other guy said about fallout is suitable here; 1 hour of Pillars of Eternity is way too short."

DatGuyLirik,33whrp,h2oYo,9,Sun Apr 26 12:42:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Throwback Thursdays?  I like that, it sounds like it would be fun."
DatGuyLirik,33whrp,Malkuno,4,Sun Apr 26 13:05:09 2015 UTC,"Throwback Thursdays, but not watching old Vods, rahter play the old games, maybe even with some of the ""old ""guys"""", like screamer guy and all of the other ""guys"" that had a appearence in liriks streaming carreer :D"
DatGuyLirik,33whrp,FusselP0wner,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"To piggyback off your idea, maybe make a Throwback Thursday that's like a Sub Sunday, but we vote for games he's played in the past and never finished."
DatGuyLirik,33whrp,SledgeTheWrestler,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:40:07 2015 UTC,"Nah, we have to stop voting bullshit, let lirik decide what he enjoyed in the past, and maybe even misses playing, like arma 2 gamemodes, and other stuff."
DatGuyLirik,33whrp,FusselP0wner,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:28:54 2015 UTC,"It would be cool if Lirik or PWN created a script just to run a replay of random old VOD on his day off Thursdays (maybe we could even pre vote on it).    I typically just load up an old VOD anyway or catch up on anything I missed during the week, but it would be more fun if everyone was watching it in chat.  It would also depend on whether Lirik would even want a replay to be run on his channel.  I watched his live casts off and on occasionally when it was on Justin TV but missed a ton of content that is gold."
DatGuyLirik,33whrp,h2oYo,4,Mon Apr 27 16:04:19 2015 UTC,I'm all for this. I started watching Lirik a year ago so I know there is a lot of great content i missed.

DatGuyLirik,33vddq,Rustic77,8,Sun Apr 26 15:13:19 2015 UTC,"Correct, that is exactly the case. He literally is the #1 streamsniper at the moment. Whenever Lirik logs in, Leo logs in within the next 5 minutes, and logs off right after Lirik logs off.  After I noticed him being a part of every single A3L session, I loaded up Lirik's stream on my 2nd monitor and hopped into Leo's car to see what happens. Lirik was at a random place and got into a car and said ""ey yooo I need a ride, go to prison!"".   Guess what happened?  Leo pulled a sudden U-turn saying ""I need to check out something at the prison real quick"". This went on for a coupla minutes and he always just magically always headed to the exact same location. I got out of the car eventually, and later saw on stream that he just casually ran into Lirik. What a lucky coincidence.  The whole thing was blatantly obvious and sad at the same time. People who do that should immediately be banned."

DatGuyLirik,33vddq,sylphzz,2,Sun Apr 26 00:41:52 2015 UTC,"I remember Lirik once said something like he does not mind people stream snipe to play with him, as long as they are not some annoying 12 y/o kids who just want to fuck with him. Like Leo and others who actually rp and not ruining the gaming experience, he does not mind. It is all about rp, as long as he does not act obviously like a typical fanboy yelling ""Lirik omg I love you"" or ""Hey Lirik, take my gears and money"", it is all cool.  If Lirik is tired of him, he will just leave the group. I don't understand why you fanboys are complaining, when your senpai does not say shit yet."

While many industrialized countries have experienced similar increases, obesity rates in the United States are among the highest in the world.   Obesity has continued to grow within the United States. Two out of every three Americans are considered to be overweight or obese. During the early 21st century, America often contained the highest percentage of obese people in the world. Obesity has led to over 120,000 preventable deaths each year in the United States. An obese person in America is likely to incur $1,497 more in medical expenses annually. Approximately $190 billion is spent in added medical expenses per year within the United States. Obesity is a preventable condition that has been increasing within the United States. Health authorities anticipate no change to this vector.  The United States had the highest rate of obesity for large countries, until obesity rates in Mexico surpassed that of the United States in 2013.  From 13% obesity in 1962, estimates have steadily increased. The following statistics comprise adults age 20 and over living at or near the poverty level. The obesity percentages for the overall US population are higher. [clarification needed] reaching 19.4% in 1997, 24.5% in 2004,  26.6% in 2007,  and 33.8% (adults) and 17% (children) in 2008.   In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported higher numbers once more, counting 35.7% of American adults as obese, and 17% of American children.  In 2013 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 27.6% of American citizens were obese. The organization estimates that 3/4 of the American population will likely be overweight or obese by 2020.     Image i - According to 2007 statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States has the highest prevalence of overweight adults in the Anglosphere.

DatGuyLirik,3372p4,Mikrostorm,9,Tue Apr 21 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"Both technically. Lirik got into DayZ while it was fairly new and luckily for him, there weren't many top streamers dominating the Survival Game genre. I remember hopping onto Twitch everyday and seeing Lirik and Puddn as the top streamers in DayZ with around 300-500 viewers (sometimes less, sometimes more). Sure, there were big streamers like Towelliee who played every now and then, but they weren't as consistent.  This isn't to say that Lirik only became popular due to DayZ, because that would be wrong, his personality is probably the most important factor there. But he most certainly benefited from what I just mentioned.  Fast forwards a year (if that) and DayZ started to benefit from all of the viewers Lirik was bringing in.  TL;DR- DayZ helped Lirik and Lirik helped DayZ. However, both would've eventually become popular even without the others help.  Edit-- I didn't think I typed this much... Sorry for the wall lol."
DatGuyLirik,3372p4,Limelol,13,Mon Apr 20 10:31:02 2015 UTC,I think they both had benefit of meeting eachother.
DatGuyLirik,3372p4,-bettadenu,2,Mon Apr 20 04:55:09 2015 UTC,"Lirik is big thanks to DayZ, and Lirik is big because of Lirik. He didn't explode until DayZ SA got released, but when he exploded it was his persona that made people want to come back.   You see people like, /destiny, spike up to 10k viewers when a game gets released, but not a lot of those people will stick around to keep watching.   TL;DR = DayZ SA gave lirik the opportunity to be huge, but Lirik was the one who actually capitalized on it and made it happen."
DatGuyLirik,3372p4,onemanmanywomen,3,Mon Apr 20 05:29:08 2015 UTC,"Lirik got a boost from Dayz admittedly, but Dayz also has got a boost from Lirik. It is indeed a double edged blade. Whenever a new release comes out people click into that category on twitch and typically hit the first stream with the most viewers, Lirik who has a community which new release or not has anywhere between 20-40k viewers daily, so when a new release comes out he usually doubles that. Lirik being the 5th most popular streamer on twitch obviously introduces people to new games(He made me buy Dayz and RoK.) so yeah double edged blade and stuff."
DatGuyLirik,3372p4,CataChaos1320,2,Mon Apr 20 05:27:30 2015 UTC,"Lirik is big because of lirik, i remember i started watching him because   he was the only streamer that actually made me laugh. I dont care what game he plays, it usually ends up with a lot of fun anyway."

DatGuyLirik,3372p4,Mikrostorm,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I bought the game because I saw him playing it all the time. So I guess a lot of other people did the same. Lirik is big because of his personality, but I'm sure he helped DayZ to sell more copies."

DatGuyLirik,3372p4,mirac_eren,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:23:23 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of both imo.  No one can deny that the DayZ SA release bumped Lirik up quite a bit in the popularity charts.   Now, Lirik is maintaining viewers by being relevant to the gaming scene. Most streamers will only stream one game that they are popular by and then if they do end up switching games, lose a lot of viewers. Whenever Lirik switches games you do not see that happening.   It also helps that if you are currently popular and that Lirik has been streaming for a while on Twitch, it is tough to lose viewers. Right now the hardest part about streaming is getting people to find your stream. Which it is hard to do without being really good at an E-Sports game or being a celebrity due to page after page of streamers.  Finally the main reason is big is that Lirik is awesome."
DatGuyLirik,3372p4,vanderjaght,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:10:41 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for Dayz but I tuned into Lirik's stream for the very first time in August or September 2014 when I wanted to check if there are any Arma3 Altis Life streams since I enjoyed watching a few LetsPlays on youtube. So I just clicked the first stream in the list which turned out to be Lirik playing A3L. I guess it was the personality, the entertainment and also the voice that is kinda very enjoyable/comfortable to listen to - no homo."

DatGuyLirik,32pfxx,honzaik,3,Wed Apr 15 17:52:29 2015 UTC,its somewhat a meme in GTA IV since roman is Nikos (main character) cousin and he seems to like bowling... a lot. Basically Roman will sometimes call you and ask if you want to go bowling with him. By sometimes I mean every 30 seconds therefore this meme

DatGuyLirik,32lza2,redditcringearmy,3,Tue Apr 14 22:44:05 2015 UTC,"Short answer: yes Complicated answer: It depends on whether you consider that mean. That is the way Lirik always is, but generally, he is pretty good to his subscribers and viewers. A lot of times when he tells someone to fuck off or insults them, he is just joking around. I have been watching three years and I can think of maybe only once where he legitimately was insulting a viewer, and I think that was because they guy was using racist slurs or something. However, the chat does seem to have a pretty large amount of perma bans. Probably the reason for that, is because he has so many subs and followers, he doesn't need to put up with anyone's ""shit,"" so you will probably see lots of people banned for the smallest infraction, like telling him to play a game. They can always donate and get unbanned. Best thing to do is lurk for a couple months to get a feel for the channel.   If you really want to see someone who is a dick to his subsand viewers, watch 5hizzle for a couple hours. He spends half his stream arguing with chat."

DatGuyLirik,32lza2,NanoTechChicken,3,Thu Apr 16 02:02:41 2015 UTC,He's been doing this forever. Usually it's more of a joke than an actual insult but I find it funny.
DatGuyLirik,32lza2,ClinchKnee,6,Wed Apr 15 09:36:18 2015 UTC,"Hey dude! I don't think he means it that way man :)   I think the main reason for when he calls his subs names, is that Lirik is a young guy that appeals to a relatively young audience.  Potty mouths are common on that age, especially on the Internet where where the people you are talking to are kind of anonymous.   Also, although he does not show it at times, I think Lirik really cares what his viewers think and is constantly trying to make the stream as awesome as possible. When someone complains he can kind of lash out at them, because it probably feels like he is being citisized. He is constantly trying to keep his viewers happy and can't stand naggers. It's probably because he cares so much that his stream is of the quality that it is. This caring does make him lash out sometimes though.   Try not to take it too seriously. He is just a young guy, caring for his stream.   Just my 2 cents.   See you around, man!"

DatGuyLirik,32ktj5,redditcringearmy,-2,Tue Apr 14 22:54:55 2015 UTC,Except he plays games where he RPs. & he stops and does the donation messages in the middle of it. So its a better analogy than with almost any other streamer.

People get out of there mentality and realize they truly enjoy him and want to support him. Some people pirate all their music, but every once in a while buy the album of their favorite artist. Some turn adblock off for certain YT channels. Some donate and subscribe.  TLDR: They don't care about the price of 2 McChickens. They want to support a streamer they enjoy."

DatGuyLirik,32hcs7,Plucky_KS,3,Tue Apr 14 05:16:25 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? He PURPOSELY killed Lirik when he was kidnapping someone in order to stream snipe. There was no way he knew about it because the victim did not text anyone.   So instead of getting to see how the whole plot would have turned out, Lirik became disinterested and annoyed, so he went to play RoK. It's literally ruining the stream..."

Have you never dealt with any type of company at all? Even in person it's extremely easy to talk to mangers to sort through problems. Same goes with twitch. There's even an option to cancel a sub on the twitch.tv/subscriptions page if you wrongly subbed to a channel.   If you for some reason did get perma banned for no good reason, and still need the money, I'll gladly give you 5 dollars in your paypal too. Buy yourself a mini meal at a fast food place. But give us your twitch username."

DatGuyLirik,32hect,Jak032,3,Tue Apr 14 16:26:39 2015 UTC,I unbanned you last night. I thought a perma was harsh. However multiple people told you to contact Twitch support. Asking Lirik to refund you directly through Paypal was never going to work out
DatGuyLirik,32hect,nighthawklol,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:46:45 2015 UTC,I'm sorry I just felt horrible after seeing the charge go through and wanted help asap... where do I go to contact twitch support and is it actually possible for me to get the 6 dollars back and they take away my lirik sub?

DatGuyLirik,32hect,twofist,14,Tue Apr 14 18:16:35 2015 UTC,"Wow man. IDK why you would do anything other than contact Twitch customer support. I'm sure they get 100s of emails of exactly the same issue every day and would refund you without problem. They probably still will if it's only been a few days since you paid...   Also, I know emergencies happen and stuff, but it sounds like you should budget better if you're not only subbing but donating as well some months, and next month NEED $6 for food."
DatGuyLirik,32hect,Redzapdos,14,Mon Apr 13 20:54:18 2015 UTC,not buying it
DatGuyLirik,32hect,Arkwoman1990,-1,Mon Apr 13 21:30:27 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind, but what would be the point in posting this then? Like what would I accomplish by making this up? I don't want to be subbed to him anymore, so there is nothing for me to gain."
DatGuyLirik,32hect,Bigbehr,2,Mon Apr 13 21:52:02 2015 UTC,i'm not buying the reason you say you were banned
DatGuyLirik,32hect,Limelol,6,Mon Apr 13 23:33:30 2015 UTC,"Nah he's right about why he was banned, he begged for his money back 5+ times. I'm a non-sub, saw it all, didn't feel bad, he got his answer."
DatGuyLirik,32hect,rushad88,1 point,Tue Apr 14 07:17:30 2015 UTC,Contact twitch to get your money back if possible and go to your subscriptions in your profile and click don't renew
DatGuyLirik,32hect,xZneak,6,Mon Apr 13 22:38:07 2015 UTC,"I remember you in chat.  About 25~ of us told you to just contact twitch support and they would be able to help you out.  Lirik doesn't even get your full 4.99 from subbing, so it's silly to ask him.  You didn't accept that answer and continued to ask/spam 10ish more times until chat finally started to complain. I feel for you with your money problems, but no sympathy with the chat problems... we told you exactly what to do, but you wanted Lirik's attention, not an actual solution."
DatGuyLirik,32hect,gkjkd,5,Tue Apr 14 09:45:22 2015 UTC,"So why not just message one of the mods saying that you were kidding? Most of the time, they're pretty reasonable. They're just people.  Keep in mind that quite a few of them keep chat logs. So if you were banned for something else and this is all a lie to get out of a ban, you can kiss your chance at being unbanned goodbye."
DatGuyLirik,32hect,w-man,2,Tue Apr 14 02:10:49 2015 UTC,i remember you. you were spamming in chat for like an hour. even after chat and mods told you to contact twitch.   thats why you got banned im guessing.   well hopefully you learned your lesson now.  PS: its pretty hard to subscribe by mistake. there are quite a few steps to sub. so i dont understand what you did
DatGuyLirik,32hect,xxCODpro420swag,3,Tue Apr 14 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"If you cant afford subscribing you shouldnt subscribe in the first place, its like paying for something and use it...then later you want your money back? Also Lirik will play the games he wants to play, people cant force him to play whatever they want to see. Imagine kids forcing lirik to play minecraft all day ;)"
DatGuyLirik,32hect,onemanmanywomen,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:44:19 2015 UTC,"did you contact twitch, to deal with it? if not then the point of this post is stupid. if you did then wait for them to do something and if nothing happens then you really don't know how to control your money and let the 5 dollar recurring subscription be a lesson to you."

DatGuyLirik,32fj84,avi6274,6,Mon Apr 13 11:33:57 2015 UTC,He admitted that he choose only 4 games to play and ended up just abandoning the whole Sub Sunday thing. It was simply a mess tbh
DatGuyLirik,32fj84,General_Revan,3,Mon Apr 13 11:40:31 2015 UTC,"Wait, doesn't a program choose 10 random games for him? What do you mean he choose 4 games?"
DatGuyLirik,32fj84,General_Revan,7,Mon Apr 13 11:41:35 2015 UTC,"He did use random.org to choose 10 games but since he felt that a lot of them were horrid, he decided to pick and choose 4 games that subs voted on, not the ones that were chosen. He says that this was because most of the games chosen were games he played already such as payday 2 and CS:GO"
DatGuyLirik,32fj84,meandyouandyouandme,5,Mon Apr 13 11:52:01 2015 UTC,Why didn't he just roll again and get other games to play?

DatGuyLirik,32fj84,AngrySnwMnky,2,Mon Apr 13 11:56:39 2015 UTC,He said 90% of the votes were for the usual stuff and because those aren't real sub sunday games he rigged the votes and selected only 4/10 of the games to play.  Hopefully next sub sunday will be better votes.
DatGuyLirik,32fj84,ReadingNotAllowed,2,Mon Apr 13 11:52:47 2015 UTC,Thanks!
DatGuyLirik,32fj84,MrZappa8,7,Mon Apr 13 11:56:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe he should change the Sub Sunday format to New Game Sunday - only playing games he's never played before.   Personally, playing something different than the steady weekday fare is what I like about Sub Sunday."
DatGuyLirik,32fj84,lampa_cz,11,Mon Apr 13 14:42:53 2015 UTC,"SubSunday is supposed to be about not playing the usual games, and then we end up with a 4 hour RoK stream, which is just massively disappointing. Why couldn't he just choose the most popular games he have played in the past? Like Mafia 2, Ori, fear 2 etc."
DatGuyLirik,32fj84,MrZappa8,9,Mon Apr 13 14:13:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like he just really wanted to play RoK, Lirik can say whatever he wants and we just have to believe it. I wouldn't be surprised if he used the 'votes were shit' argument as an excuse.. Not to be an asshole but if it wasn't the case he could have easily picked 3 other decent games out of the 2300 votes instead. Also there were alot of great suggestions during the stream (because he asked for it) but he just ignored/denied them all so yea"
DatGuyLirik,32fj84,Blumz,9,Mon Apr 13 15:26:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if he used the 'votes were shit' argument as an excuse..      he did.

DatGuyLirik,32fj84,Herbspiceguy,6,Mon Apr 13 13:57:31 2015 UTC,I found that thread through Google and thought the complaints were valid. I think it's extremely immature of whoever mod decided to delete this thread.
DatGuyLirik,32fj84,PGpanda,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"You should take it up with Lirik himself then. Mods don't remove any posts unless its inappropriate, spam or anything else that brings nothing to the sub-reddit. Please don't assume its one of the mods' doing."
DatGuyLirik,32fj84,Jak032,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:28:56 2015 UTC,"Allright, excuse me, I'm not too familiar with this Reddit.  Anyways, even though I don't think it's fair how Lirik handled this SubSunday, I think a suggestion (like changing it so that already played games won't be counted in his RNG thing or a simple blacklist) thread for SubSunday would be more productive. Complaining dwells in negative energy, but still it would've been interesting to see the votes, because I believe Lirik exaggerates the amount of ""shit"" games."

DatGuyLirik,32bzj1,Delinquent_,1 point,Mon Apr 13 07:06:03 2015 UTC,for someone who has no idea about the Cs go betting thing. Can someone explain to me. Also whats the deal with unboxing cases? why is that more exciting than actually playing the game.
DatGuyLirik,32bzj1,sixpooler,3,Sun Apr 12 14:26:40 2015 UTC,The cases are just your average RNG box that just about every sports game and MMO have had for years.  It is a way of making loads of money for a company that gets people (suckers) to spend a lot of money hoping for rare collectibles/items.
DatGuyLirik,32bzj1,kievakula,2,Sun Apr 12 20:27:46 2015 UTC,"Cases are like mini lotto tickets, you open one for $2.50 and have a chance of getting a thousand dollar knife. $10-$60 items are more common but 0.01 cent skins are even more common :)"
DatGuyLirik,32bzj1,FaZeD_LoLiTa,0,Sun Apr 12 14:33:02 2015 UTC,so its like p2w kind of thing? cuz whats the difference between the thousand dollar knife and one that is default. IM guessing it deals more damage.
DatGuyLirik,32bzj1,sixpooler,8,Sun Apr 12 15:16:51 2015 UTC,No not at all. All skins in the game are purely cosmetic and do nothing to change how the weapon works.
DatGuyLirik,32bzj1,WeegeeXD,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:19:31 2015 UTC,To add to that: some knifes have different animations with them. When you pull a butterfly knife out compared to a normal one it just looks cool but takes exactly the same amount of time / doesn't change anything but the look of it.
DatGuyLirik,32bzj1,HenryyyyyyyyJenkins,5,Mon Apr 13 01:50:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no difference other then look. Here is a website with all the skins you can look at if you are interested.  CSGO is the only game I truly enjoy and always go back to, so buying some cases/skins is fun. Also you can always sell it back to the marketplace for steam funds. For example, I wanted to get GTA5 so I just sold 2 of my skins on the market and then bought GTA."
DatGuyLirik,32bzj1,FaZeD_LoLiTa,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"The CS:GO betting on CSGO Jackpot basically allows someone to make a bet of selected skins in his steam inventory. The participant enters his skins into a pool. His odds of winning are determined by total value of the items he entered, and should he win, he gets the entire pot. Incredibly easy way to get more valuable skins if you already have some decent inventory value, or get your hands on a knife if you dont own one.  On the other hand, losing everything is real easy too."

DatGuyLirik,32bq3h,Aramarth,7,Sun Apr 12 12:00:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah the jet explosion has been bugging me as well.  I noticed that after it most of the sound effects are missing, so it's probably intended (like a montage), but the transition from sound to no sound is so sudden that is feels very strange."
DatGuyLirik,32bq3h,Jtaneli,9,Sun Apr 12 14:17:19 2015 UTC,"Not to bitch but I don't really like the new intro, didn't get me hyped and it feel really weird when there are no audio effects at some points but in the end there is some sound from the monster."
DatGuyLirik,32bq3h,DUHDUM,2,Sun Apr 12 14:11:11 2015 UTC,"I guess we are all different but I thought it was bordering on epic when I saw it. Everything from the clever concept (guy rushing home from work and worrying about missing the start of the stream so he starts imagining what he is missing), to the animation and music, all of which was spot on IMO.  Big thumbs up to the guys behind it."
DatGuyLirik,32bq3h,rcon__,2,Sun Apr 12 17:51:06 2015 UTC,"The intro itself was fucking amazing work, and so was the soundtrack behind it. Sadly, the explosion sounds / most of the missing soundeffects in general just didn't give me the full ""wow"" effect. Luckily it'd be kinda easy to add the sounds afterwards, but mastering it would take some time, at least if you want it to sound realistic & don't want everything to overlap.  Intro without sound at all is 10/10, but the real deal is sadly more like a 7/10, could've been way better with additional sounds."
DatGuyLirik,32bq3h,Blacerrr,3,Mon Apr 13 00:11:26 2015 UTC,"I was wondering too. Other sound effects seem to work fine, for example at the very beginning during the The Elder Scrolls Scene. Maybe its intended though?"

DatGuyLirik,3297fi,ihatemaps,-6,Sat Apr 11 19:34:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool but I feel like it's really lacking the cat.

Or having him running away from someone in a car and then crashing into a fence. Seems like the guys who made it didn't really know the stream that well. When does Lirik ever play flying sims?

DatGuyLirik,32cu1x,VenserTheSojourner,3,Sun Apr 12 18:42:08 2015 UTC,"Careful, the mods/lirik seem to be deleting posts about sub sunday right now"
DatGuyLirik,32cu1x,SourDiezel22,3,Mon Apr 13 02:06:27 2015 UTC,"2k votes is still a lot imo, even if he has 10k subs. At least enough to get a decent selection of games Some people enjoy watching anything and don't really care about voting"
DatGuyLirik,32cu1x,MrZappa8,3,Sun Apr 12 18:53:57 2015 UTC,It shouldn't be about quantity anyway. Who cares if there are 2000+ votes if half of them are regular games.
DatGuyLirik,32cu1x,koen092,2,Sun Apr 12 20:24:01 2015 UTC,"I'm a nonsub (soon to be subbing) and I love Lirik himself, his streams and the subs. Sub Sunday is called 'Sub Sunday' for a reason; it's the subs day where they get to see games voted by them played by Lirik himself. I understand your point on 'open the votes to nonsubs and you'll get way more' but when you do that, there are more non subs than subs so pretty much it may aswell just be 'Vote for your games Sunday' because 70% of the votes will come from non subs.   Honestly, I don't care about votes because it doesn't really affect anything. All that happens is one day, there may only be 5 games but the games he plays is what makes Sub Sunday funny, not the amount of votes. Some games could get 1 vote and be the best game ever. Quality of game > quantity of votes."
DatGuyLirik,32cu1x,ThisNameIsPointless_,2,Mon Apr 13 08:03:22 2015 UTC,I think 2K votes is a reasonable number considering alot probably are people who just subbing to support Lirik but not interact like using chat or voting. Some either forget or dont bother so at least a percentage who choose and/or remember to vote have their voice heard. I sometimes forget to vote but mostly do so I think 20ish% is a good number.
DatGuyLirik,32cu1x,B247E,2,Mon Apr 13 15:48:00 2015 UTC,I don't necessary think that he really needs to do a full sub Sunday anyways. Like 3-4 games would be plenty if they each lasted an hour each.
DatGuyLirik,32cu1x,shankeyx,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:45:38 2015 UTC,"Lirik already answered this saying it wouldn't be sub sunday if everyone can vote.  Lirik also has said, everyone votes too many votes, only subs barely enough votes"

DatGuyLirik,32cu1x,PGpanda,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:29:36 2015 UTC,"I like Sub Sunday, and the format is laid out in such a way that we can get shitty games, good well know games and hidden gems! That's special and I like it. But changing the format every so often, somewhat would be cool. My idea is that Sub Sunday is changed to mosted voted games get like 1-10 and not random. The important thing here is that Lirik doesn't mention this, because then we will get really troll votes. Like Singstar and shit like that, dont get me wrong Singstar would be hilarious, but you get what I mean. And OFC Lirik has the final judgement so that he can remove games witch he already have played alot or doesn't like. Would be fun too see if we get a better Sub Sunday. My second Idea is that Lirik dose two pick for Sub Sunday. While doing the regular format, he also does a top 10. Then he has 14 games, witch he pick 7 of his liking and has 6 backup games of his liking. All this is IMO, feel free to argue. ""MM"""
DatGuyLirik,32cu1x,milkmagic,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:48:19 2015 UTC,thats the biggest load of shit i have read in a while. Because non subs dont want to pay 5$ per month for whatever reason they dont deserve to participate in the stream? So it looks like that the votes doesnt even matter at sub sunday cause Lirik is playing whatever he wants anyways which makes sense from a streamer perspective i guess.. maybe thats why there are only 20% of the subs voting

DatGuyLirik,32alko,LordMatsu,4,Sun Apr 12 02:22:16 2015 UTC,"He always says he doesn't want to play a Singleplayer game or is not in the mood for it.. then why does he say 'I gotta beat this game' ? It's kinda frustrating as a viewer to hear this and being all excited that he will/wants to finish this game, but in the end he will never touch it. unless it gets voted ""again"" for sub sunday.. So yeah the idea is pretty good, although I don't think he will do it. Don't get me wrong, I love his stream nonetheless, but hearing him say that he wants to beat this game and then does not touch it ever again makes me salty"
DatGuyLirik,32alko,Goddess_Jessica,2,Sun Apr 12 12:12:27 2015 UTC,"It does make me sad too that he says it but probably will never do it.  I just thought, it'd help him play those games if he really wanted to beat them if he made it a ""day"" to do it."
DatGuyLirik,32alko,adamcsay,4,Mon Apr 13 00:18:51 2015 UTC,"cool idea but the problem is lirik is fickle as hell. i don't mean that as an insult and i think that's actually one of the reasons he's one of the best streamers on twitch. but with that being said, i usually take any comments he says about beating a game with a grain of salt."
DatGuyLirik,32alko,byKonzii,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:48:38 2015 UTC,"True, but as a big fan of watching him play just about everything, if he ""truly"" wants to beat a game, I think it'd be good to make it a day to do that.  It'd be a nice change of pace similar to sub sunday.  This way, any game he really wants to beat, he can play a few hours of each on that day.  Just a thought, but regardless, I'll be watching :)"
DatGuyLirik,32alko,FusselP0wner,7,Sun Apr 12 08:15:58 2015 UTC,"he's had tons of opportunities to complete games like mafia2 and/or Ori seeing how he sometimes sits there without anything to play, but he just doesnt want to.   Since he's so busy with streaming, I think it's hard for him to play much outside of streaming.   doubt thats true as he has tons of freetime i think"
DatGuyLirik,32alko,stjunk,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"Well he streams from 12pm to about 6pm everyday (EST), then til about 8-9pm if he has night streams.  The only time to play other games or do anything else is before he streams or on Thursdays.  That's not much time.

DatGuyLirik,31tyxd,mirac_eren,2,Fri Apr 10 02:01:16 2015 UTC,"Great site, but like you said, it only goes back until December.  This is another great site to see what he's played and dates all the way back to 2011. Keep in mind that this isn't perfect either. While it has every VoD, you can only search by the Stream title. Games played during Sub Sundays / Night Streams aren't likely to end up in the title.  However, with big releases, Lirik does add the name to titles. You could also search by using the date. So if you Google the release date of a certain game, then type that date into the search bar, you could see if he played it on launch."

It is used widely in Unix-like and many other operating systems and file formats. Due to its handling of leap seconds, it is neither a linear representation of time nor a true representation of UTC.  Unix time may be checked on most Unix systems by typing date +%s on the command line.    Image i - Unix time passed 1,000,000,000 seconds in 2001-09-09T01:46:40Z.

DatGuyLirik,31s91z,brydon10,2,Tue Apr 7 20:46:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure but I think this is how its set up: His gaming PC has 3 monitors, 2x 1080p and 1x 1440p. One of the 1080p monitors is running OBS's fullscreen preview of the 1440p monitor and he then uses a 1080p capture card to get what is shown on the preview monitor to his streaming PC. The streaming PC then takes that 1080p capture and downscales it to 1536*864. He is going to get a 1440p capture card and get rid of that hacky workaround SOON™      Again, I'm not sure if this is exactly what he is doing."

DatGuyLirik,31nji1,xZneak,2,Mon Apr 6 18:59:13 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain how this works? Like is it a massive Battle Royale with prizes? How long does the event usually last?
DatGuyLirik,31nji1,SledgeTheWrestler,3,Tue Apr 7 00:23:56 2015 UTC,"Can anyone explain how this works? Like is it a massive Battle Royale with prizes? How long does the event usually last?   How does this work? - Its like the Hunger Games movie. Teammates spawn next to each other but all teams spawn in a circle with no weapons or gear. You have an option to get loot/bags in the middle of the circle (which normally have medic gear or food). But thats up to you and your teammate to go into the circle and have time wasted when you could have used that time to get a weapon in a town. Or you have the other option, which is to just run to the objective (which is the on map to stay within the circle and survive. First team that wins, gets prizes from the Sponsors (For example PsiSyndicate and his teammate KATT got Astro Gear the time he won).  How long does it last? - It depends on the players. It can last an hour or it can last 2 - 3 hours. Survivor GameZ people (the people who host the game) try to get the best livestreamers that dont suck, so they host qualifiers to find the best teams to take place in this event. Mostly livestreamers that have a large amount of viewers or a big following on YouTube (in the DayZ community) normally get in without qualifying."

DatGuyLirik,31oxt4,poye,2,Tue Apr 7 02:18:04 2015 UTC,"I only heard a few things about the first A3L server. They charged 30$ for beta access when charging for mods is against the Arma TOS.   They also took mods from other people without permission and without giving credit.   Then the main guy running it took a bunch of donation money and peaced out. The he came back and deleted a bunch of server shit. Someone else has rebuilt or is rebuilding it from a backup last i heard.   Somewhere in between all that, someone stole their server assets and made their own a3l server. The guy on the original a3l server banned anyone who went on the fake a3l server. This caused a bunch of streamers to jump ship to the fake a3l Server since most of them didnt know about the theft."

Yandere Sim was amazing, not for the game itself (Lirik was playing the debug version of a demo, so it was very limiting), but for Lirik's and chat's reactions. The music bits were amazing, especially the Attack on Titan one.  And Verbis Virtus was my favorite Sub Sunday game yet. It's one of those games that I really want him to play more of. I would go into detail more, but I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone who may watch the VoD. Just make sure you watch it if you missed it."

They told me to roll whatever server I wanted. You can still group and do stuff within the world but will not be able to do WvW together. Plus apparently they are debating a server transfer.

DatGuyLirik,31azaj,Master_Tactician,2,Fri Apr 3 13:05:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I acknowledged that he isn't required to read your donation in my original message, however that doesn't stop people from expecting him to, and then getting upset when he doesn't and donating a second time to tell him he missed it. I think Lirik also understands this, otherwise he wouldn't tell people sorry when he reads the missed donation message, he would tell them he isn't obligated to read their donation. That's why a disclaimer saying it might not get read might help and people wouldn't feel the need to complaint that he missed their donation."
DatGuyLirik,31azaj,Dramatic_Explosion,2,Fri Apr 3 13:13:31 2015 UTC,"doesn't stop people from expecting him to   ""Caution: Tips are to show appreciation for a good stream, not a way of soliciting a service. Your tip message may not be read on stream, the streamer may not scream your name while crying because of your tip, or take a rusty knife and carve your likeness into their chest while choking themselves with a belt."""
DatGuyLirik,31azaj,FusselP0wner,1 point,Sat Apr 4 11:21:48 2015 UTC,"I was about to write almost the same, but you already did it."
DatGuyLirik,31azaj,Limelol,8,Fri Apr 3 17:45:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly? A disclaimer isn't needed. The donation is to support the stream. If he reads it over everything else in chat, it's just a bonus. He shouldn't have to add a disclaimer because a few people are being self-entitled.  The only time he misses donations is when he has to focus on the game. It should be common sense that he is going to put the stream's entertainment over a donation message.   And a lot of the time when he reads 1 donation, he'll go back to see if he missed any and if he did, he'll call them out.  Lirik missed my sub and a few of my resubs. Does it bother me? No. Does he need to add a disclaimer saying that subs might not get called out? No. I subbed for the reason the sub and donation buttons are there: to support him.  So again, a disclaimer isn't needed for the people who think their donations are more important than the stream."
DatGuyLirik,31azaj,XXXxhxXXX,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:43:27 2015 UTC,Lets be honest if you can not figure out that somebody in the middle of a game being spammed 3 donation messages at least a minute might not see your donation then I don't know what to tell you.
DatGuyLirik,31azaj,0b4m4,7,Sun Apr 5 12:40:55 2015 UTC,I've donated a few times and it's always when it wouldn't be a distraction from an engaging moment in the game.   When the idle screen is up or when he is switching games is a good time to donate for it to be read.   When he is in the final 5 of a BR or in the middle of a scuffle with the cops in a3l is not a good time to donate if you want your donation read as I've noticed.
DatGuyLirik,31buzn,LordJaraxxus,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:16:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I fully agree. I understand that he might feel pressure, but its sad if he stops playing games he enjoys (Like Titanfall) just because chat's bitchy."
DatGuyLirik,31buzn,ihatemaps,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:22:18 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but if he plays games he wants to play solely that chat hates, he will lose viewers, which will affect his income. A good example is Super Smash Bros. That is a terrible game to stream, but he loves playing it."
DatGuyLirik,31buzn,Dekcolnu,0,Fri Apr 3 17:31:40 2015 UTC,"This isn't the first time someone made a post about this,  and it's nonsense. People spam A3L,  he doesn't play it.  People spam whatever. He doesn't play it.  He also responded on that topic and likely isn't going to respond here because... It's bullshit? He plays what he wants and likes,  if he doesn't like it he doesn't continue or doesn't play it at all. And even if he does give in once in a while,  you heard him right? He's waiting for new games because guess what? It might get boring sometimes playing the same shit over and over. I can't believe I'm actually responding to this but whatever."
