Birmingham,3e3n4r,LosanWosan,2,Tue Jul 21 18:28:16 2015 UTC,Charter has the infrastructure to deliver speeds they advertise to MOST but not ALL of the houses in their service area. Most of the problem areas are closer to the downtown. Unfortunately Att can not come near to matching the cable infrastructure for speed except for their limited optic/uverse lines. Those cannot match competing speeds at the same price though.
Birmingham,3e3n4r,letsmakeweirdart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:11:40 2015 UTC,"I've played the game before...   Fortunately, I've had pretty good service in BHam (knocking on wood)...    Previously, when my calls to Charter had no positive results, I documented my interactions, I shared them on various forums (Broadband.net) and then I shared my sharing with Charter... I admit that I've experienced a range of responses from my sharing of sharing - from termination of service due to a 'reported' violation of their TOS to immediate resolution...   Essentially, in the end if it is their systems that are to blame, you have to make it cost more for them to ignore the problem than it is to fix it - i.e. getting them on the phone while it's down, having them confirm the problem, scheduling an appointment, meeting the tech at your house, rinse, repeat...   I know it's a pain... I know that it's easier to just not... I know that it doesn't fix your problem now - when you need it most... For better or for worse, in our Region, Charter is cable king...  But I assure you, if you're having confirmable problems as regularly as it seems that you're implying, if you get a tech out each time, they will fix whatever it is... In the previous case where I got the TOS termination (to get me to take a site down), they wound up replacing the supplying signal amplifier as well as all of the outdated lines supplying my entire neighborhood (note: Charter, but not Birmingham)..  As a remote employee, I feel your pain (as I have experienced it directly on more than one occasion).  Best of luck!"

Five of them are charged with disorderly conduct, and one is charged with resisting arrest._  Translation: they weren't getting any reaction or support so they decided to be assholes and block traffic. Just like the college kids in California.   And since they arrested 5-6 of them, they get a chance to see firsthand the treatment that the deceased experienced in the jail (if not released.)

Not sure why everyone thinks this is some kind of big deal, other than it'll be one of the first non-liquor stores in the state to sell liquor (unlike places like Florida where grocery stores get to sell liquor).  Hoover approving Costco to sell iquor doesn't magically exempt Costco from ABC's importation rules. They'll still have to bring it into the state through ABC."
Birmingham,3dz48a,mixduptransistor,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  The public will see no savings from this plan, and I doubt we will see much of any selection increase."
Birmingham,3dz48a,patermortis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"The only potential benefit is if Costco decides it wants to carry a certain bottle.  The ABC will sometimes bring things in on request or a retailer if the retailer commits to buying a certain quantity of the product, or at least that's what I've heard.  Also, there are a number of bottles that the ABC sells, usually the more esoteric bottles, that you can only buy by the case. For a smaller liquor store. Byying a case of something that won't move within the year isn't feasible but Costco has enough money that that would not likely be an issue."

Birmingham,3dz48a,Ben_Afflock,3,Mon Jul 20 20:03:01 2015 UTC,"Does this mean that Costco will have to sell its liquor to the state and then immediately buy it back from the ABC so that it can sell it in its stores?  I thought the state was the sole importer and distributor of liquor in the state? Acme Liquor Store in Hoover has to buy it's liquor for re-sale from the ABC the same as you and me? (Maybe at a slightly lower wholesale price)   Then they mark it up to turn a profit. That's why a 1.75L of Maker's costs $59.99 at an ABC store and $95 at a liquor store. The only benefit of buying from a private business over the state is convenience e.g. location/hours.  So if Costoco wants to sell Kirkland brand vodka, will they have to sell it to the state?"
Birmingham,3dz48a,GrantGannon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:01 2015 UTC,They sell Kirkland beer in the store so hopefully they'll carry the liquor too.

They had a brown ale, IPA, pale ale, and i believe a wheat beer of some sort. They were very good beers and much better than any other $18 case I've ever found."

Birmingham,3dxtk9,uncannythom,18,Mon Jul 20 15:09:45 2015 UTC,I had a blast. Went with some friends from New Orleans that said that this was the best festival they'd been to. Can't wait until next year. I hope they get Judah & the Lion next year. Never heard of them until I saw them at Sloss. Definitely one of the best shows of the festival.
Birmingham,3dxtk9,bridgwj,3,Mon Jul 20 13:22:39 2015 UTC,Judah and the Lion was solid! Definitely going to start following that band.
Birmingham,3dxtk9,Hubes,30,Tue Jul 21 01:27:16 2015 UTC,"I had a great time.   The water situation got better on Sunday and I think they will be ready in the future.   I think the price on domestic lights was too high, but I don't have a problem paying $8 for a 16 oz craft beer. I wish they were better stocked though.   Only major change I'd like to see is a few acts on Friday and an earlier finish on Sunday.   10/10 would go again."

Birmingham,3dxtk9,PayMeNoAttention,13,Mon Jul 20 13:45:35 2015 UTC,"Besides paying $8 for a Miller Lite, I can't really find much to complain about.  I went from 5-11 on Saturday and 4 - 9:30 on Sunday.  I think the reason this was so great is because they focused on the small things...  Every concert started right on time.  I mean right on time. I never noticed them get off the schedule once.  Last night Manchester Orchestra actually played about a minute or so over, and St. Paul & the Broken Bones  started on time.  There was just a bit of overlap.  I loved the app.  It was a little sketchy with the notifications (I got some, but my wife got others), but it was convenient and very helpful.  The crowd was pretty sparse on both days until about 6:30, so it made getting up to the stages relatively easy.  This also made parking not too bad if you got there early enough.  Thanks to the golf cart guys for driving us around.  They added more bathrooms on Sunday along with more water stations, so that was nice of them to notice and adapt.    The misting tent was awesome for when you were really hot.  They need more of these.  The lines got bad when it got crowded, but that is what you are going to get at a festival.  No real problem there."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,pirateyoho,12,Mon Jul 20 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"My only complaint from the first day was the wait for water, but by day two I was only waiting in line for 10 minutes thanks to the extra stations they added for day two. I love how prompt they were about fixing that, as opposed to just ""making a note for next year.""  Otherwise, loved everything about it. Next year, I'd like to see more booths of non-musician artists; I really liked the ones they had and would have enjoyed a few more."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,mister-manager_,9,Mon Jul 20 14:55:18 2015 UTC,"I agree on the non-musician artists. It was like a whole other world over by Shed stage where all those booths/food trucks were. I understand why they had them where they were, just wish they had some in other places too"
Birmingham,3dxtk9,niklovin,11,Mon Jul 20 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"I was very impressed. It's amazing to have a festival of such high quality in our own backyard.  There was some sound bleeding between the Blast and Steam stages and people might complain that those stages are too close together, but I think that's more of a scheduling issue. I loved being able to walk from the Blast Stage and the Steam Stage in a matter of seconds.  As people have already pointed out, the mixing was a little shaky at times, but I think that can be worked out next year.   The food was some of the best I've ever had at a festival. The people were great. The energy was high. All in all, a great experience and way better than I was expecting. I think it's a hell of a start and I'll for sure be back next year."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,See_Em,11,Mon Jul 20 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"I thought the security was perfect this year. Not too invasive, didn't really bother anybody or harass people too much.

Birmingham,3dxtk9,artfufkin,9,Mon Jul 20 17:00:59 2015 UTC,"I've been to a lot of music festivals and this was a very good one for a smaller festival. The water situation was terrible on Saturday. I don't know how they didn't consider having more than one water source. I know they threw some hoses over a fence later, but that was poor planning. Everything else logistics or organization wise was great.  Most of my complaints have to do with the lineup, not the festival. It seems a lot of the acts were festival retreads. Maybe I'm spoiled...but this trend continues I would guess the book MMJ, Wilco or Flaming Lips next year. I'll still go, obviously."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,vulcans_pants,7,Mon Jul 20 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, as someone who doesn't go to music festivals, I thought the line-up was surprisingly great for a first time event in Birmingham."

Birmingham,3dxtk9,LJGremlin,8,Mon Jul 20 19:55:12 2015 UTC,"I worked the event on Saturday and attending on Sunday.  I have nothing to complain about.  From working with a vendor on Saturday, the instructions and directions from all parties involved seemed pretty solid.  It seemed the people directing staff parking were all informed (which is not always the case).  Sunday, the line wasn't too long (about 3:30) and they were warning people in the line about the policies before hand and yet people still were having to dump liquid at the gate (these people are often why lines are long and problems occur).  The bands were solid.  The times were kept which was really impressive.  Never seemed like the lines for food took too long and the prices, while a tad high, were not completely unreasonable for a festival.   It was easy to get in, parking was great (free parking/three block walk).  Traffic seemed to be handled well from what I can tell.  All in all, it was all very well done."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,LJGremlin,5,Mon Jul 20 18:41:17 2015 UTC,"I will say the wifi left a lot to be desired.

Birmingham,3dxtk9,PayMeNoAttention,4,Mon Jul 20 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"I took full water bottles in with no problem on Sunday.  I know I wasn't supposed to, but the water line was so bad on Saturday that I took the risk.  I made it in no problem.  However, I will say that they fixed the water problem on Sunday, so the risk may have been unnecessary."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,hobowithabazooka,4,Mon Jul 20 19:02:20 2015 UTC,I walked right in carrying a sealed gallon jug of water. I wish they had advertised that you could do that a bit better

Birmingham,3dxtk9,plimbaugh,14,Mon Jul 20 22:15:44 2015 UTC,"On the whole I was really impressed with the job they did putting this on for a first-time event. My friends and I had an awesome time all weekend and definitely would like to come back again in the future.    My only complaints were with the beer & food prices (but that's festivals for you) and the mixing for some of the artists in the Shed stage (Tyler the Creator's set in particular, but maybe that's just the nature of playing over that many people in an all-metal building). So really, nothing too major. Maybe the lineup could perhaps have been a bit more diverse, but on the other hand I think they selected a set of artists that fit the overall theme of the festival and the feel of the city fairly well. And across the board the performances were great, I definitely feel like I got good value for the cost of my ticket. Logistically, I thought things went very smoothly for the most part other than the huge lines for water on Saturday, but I liked that they added more water stations on Sunday in response to the high demand.    I think this was a great thing for the city of Birmingham, and I hope to see it continue to grow bigger and better in future years!"
Birmingham,3dxtk9,MuppetEA,6,Mon Jul 20 12:50:27 2015 UTC,"Can anyone share their experience with the VIP or ""Iron"" passes?  I had GA tickets and had a blast. Sound quality was impressive at Blast & Steam stage. Everyone staying on schedule was nice. More water stations would be nice. I thought the food choices were adequate, especially for a music festival. I actually expected there to be many, many more food trucks though since they're pretty popular around town now. I wanted a few more art & craft vendors, but that's just a personal thing I think."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,vulcans_pants,6,Mon Jul 20 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't have VIP passes but friends who did had good things to say: plenty of room to sit in air conditioning, plus ice for your water bottles!"
Birmingham,3dxtk9,malloryhair,4,Mon Jul 20 16:39:39 2015 UTC,"The iron tents were air conditioned, and you could hear the music at either stage. They had places to sit and a bar inside. It was nice, but I don't think I'll pay for it again next year unless they add some more bonuses."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,LaUnika,6,Mon Jul 20 22:17:50 2015 UTC,Parking was a little pricey. And the water stuff. Overall great experience - which it was in a different month like September or something.

Birmingham,3dxtk9,MuppetEA,9,Mon Jul 20 14:49:16 2015 UTC,"Man, this was such a special thing for Birmingham. And 5 years ago I wouldn't have thought something like this would have been possible or successful. It's amazing we can now accommodate something like this now. I really don't have any complaints about food or drink.  My main issue, small as it is, is I would have liked to have heard a little more variety. Tyler the creator and Sturgill Simpson were refreshing. I would have enjoyed a rock band like Gaslight Anthem or something heavier like Baroness or Mastodon. But I'm sure there are people in charge of things like that paid a lot of money to make those decisions. And maybe that line of thought is what made Crawfish Boil so diluted and awful."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,MuppetEA,5,Mon Jul 20 15:27:33 2015 UTC,Echoing a desire for a little more variety - specifically one more act harder rock and one more hip-hop / rap seem like easy additions. Everyone else is spot on - loved being able to count on the schedule and the responsiveness of the organizers vis a vis the water situation Saturday versus Sunday.
Birmingham,3dxtk9,gmnitsua,6,Mon Jul 20 16:38:01 2015 UTC,"There actually were two hip-hop artists on Sunday, it's just that Kenny Loften is a kid from Hoover who's just starting out and doesn't have a big name or big following, so he had an earlier time and a short set (30 minutes, the shortest of the festival I think) that lots of people didn't see. I thought he was really pretty good, though.    Agreed that another harder, heavier band would've been a good addition, and I personally would've liked to see maybe one more electronic/DJ-type act on top of Big Gigantic and Purity Ring (who were both highlights of the weekend to me).    It actually seemed like the Sunday lineup was much more eclectic than the Saturday lineup, which had an overwhelmingly alternative/indie feel in the later afternoon & evening. I wonder if this was by design to cater to the people buying one-day tickets who might prefer a certain style, or if it just kind of happened that way."

Birmingham,3dxtk9,phen0men0n,5,Mon Jul 20 23:05:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking of how I would love to see asap Ferg.
Birmingham,3dxtk9,mixduptransistor,4,Mon Jul 20 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"Man, this was such a special thing for Birmingham. And 5 years ago I wouldn't have thought something like this would have been possible or successful. It's amazing we can now accommodate something like this now.   We had something like this for a long time, City Stages. If it weren't for some unfortunate mismanagement that happened right in the middle of the recession I suspect it would still be in existence. Most of the folks involved with Sloss Fest were involved with City Stages, too.   My main issue, small as it is, is I would have liked to have heard a little more variety.   Definitely sounds like you want City Stages. I do, too. Would be great to have a bigger festival downtown with a bigger diversity of acts."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,gmnitsua,11,Mon Jul 20 17:32:58 2015 UTC,"Most of the folks involved with Sloss Fest were involved with City Stages, too.   I'm sorry, but that is not entirely true. City Stages was run by George McMillan, and Sloss Fest was a joint project between AC Entertainment and Red Mountain Entertainment, which is based in Birmingham. McMillan Associates had nothing to do with Sloss Fest, which is a very good thing. City Stages was an incredibly dysfunctional festival that owed over $150,000 to artists at the time of its ending. Sloss Fest is run by two promotion companies, both of which are among the largest and best in the country at putting on music festivals (AC Entertainment started Bonnaroo, and Red Mountain runs Memphis in May and Bayfest, both very large and successful festivals)."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,Wwise,4,Mon Jul 20 18:24:32 2015 UTC,"AC Entertainment was brought on board at City Stages in 2008. I didn't say everyone putting on Sloss Fest was involved in City Stages and I didn't say that everyone involved in City Stages was involved with Sloss Fest, but there's only a certain number of people who do these types of things in Birmingham, and there definitely was cross pollination."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,sealedHuman,7,Mon Jul 20 20:32:43 2015 UTC,Honestly I didn't really like city stages. But no city stages was a little bit too mainstream. I liked how most of the bands were a little more obscure here at sloss.
Birmingham,3dxtk9,lafeeverte17,4,Mon Jul 20 17:39:11 2015 UTC,"I had a blast! I didn't see one bad show. The biggest problem I and some others had was with the venders. They would take your change as a tip without giving you an option. In the beer line a guy got chewed up and spit out before he could even get his change to tip. And honestly, the girl was just taking beer cans and opening them for you.   I totally realize that tips are important and no one wants to be shafted. But I only bought one drink all weekend because it was such a crappy experience. In a place with so many good vibes it seemed to be a dark cloud."
Birmingham,3dxtk9,treetopless,5,Mon Jul 20 21:11:35 2015 UTC,"Along those lines, if you paid with a credit card, another sneaky thing I noticed some beer vendors doing was pre-selecting the 20% tip option before turning the iPad screen around for you to sign, obviously figuring that people who intended to leave no tip would simply sign without noticing and end up actually giving 20%. So that was kind of off-putting, even though I did actually intend to tip (15% though, which is about my usual rate for someone who's just pouring me a beer)."

Birmingham,3ds6to,MisterTito,2,Sun Jul 19 16:10:34 2015 UTC,"That seems about right.   12 Oz Heinekens were 7 dollars at Ultra. Counterpoint had 7-8 dollar beers.  It just still surprises me everytime I see 16 Oz High Life, Miller Lite, and the summer shandy all for 8 dollars. Those are dollar beers at the gas station.   I thought to myself last night, how do they even justify that?"
Birmingham,3ds6to,sexfart,2,Sun Jul 19 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"They don't have to justify it. They're like an amusement park in that they have a captive audience and no competition, and people do want what they're selling, so they can essentially price gouge without repercussions.

We had fun, but it was almost impossible to get a cab there from our hotel...and it was even more of a task to get one back. There was no taxi stand when we got out of the festival. We left before Modest Mouse was over too."
Birmingham,3ds6to,akci,24,Sun Jul 19 13:57:33 2015 UTC,That's not the festival. That is the sad state of taxis in Birmingham. You are almost better off trying to make friends with someone with a car.    Taxis are more of an idea than a reality in Birmingham.
Birmingham,3ds6to,sockdologer,7,Sun Jul 19 14:04:08 2015 UTC,"I've noticed.  But if I were running a festival, I think I would give the taxi companies a call...have a plan set up beforehand on where there will be a taxi stand. It would have benefited the festival-goers and the taxi drivers presumably to have a line of taxis ready for patrons. It seems like it was an afterthought if it was thought of at all."
Birmingham,3ds6to,sockdologer,6,Sun Jul 19 14:09:38 2015 UTC,Instead they sit at the Birmingham airport. Waste.
Birmingham,3ds6to,MisterTito,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Most of the taxis in Birmingham set up camp at or around the Airport or in areas where fares need to get to the airport (downtown, UAB, etc.)   Getting a reliable cab in the outlying areas is about as reliable or even less reliable than attempting to take use the B'ham bus system."
Birmingham,3ds6to,lafeeverte17,4,Mon Jul 20 22:04:17 2015 UTC,It's actually illegal for taxis to pick up people who hail them outside of certain 'zones' in birmingham.
Birmingham,3ds6to,tuffy11111,11,Mon Jul 20 04:06:07 2015 UTC,Welcome to Birmingham's world 24/7. I'm sorry you had so much trouble.
Birmingham,3ds6to,CrimsonPride15,11,Sun Jul 19 14:18:12 2015 UTC,"The only negative I've seen is the slow lines at the water station. I've heard though that they're adding another one for tomorrow, and they were allowing some folks to keep their water in their bottles.  Also, they allow one unopened water container in per person, so grab a gallon of water from the grocery store and fill up your bottles."
Birmingham,3ds6to,frenchtoastking17,4,Sun Jul 19 04:58:59 2015 UTC,Smart smart.   Dumb question but could you bring something like a soft sided cooler in?
Birmingham,3ds6to,frenchtoastking17,3,Sun Jul 19 05:06:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I saw people with 3 day hiking backpacks full to bursting, so if they're allowing them, I can't see why not allow small soft side coolers. But logic isn't always a reliable guide for such matters."

Birmingham,3ds6to,malloryhair,10,Sun Jul 19 08:07:24 2015 UTC,"Water was an issue. They need more water stations and they should have been more transparent that they were allowing one unopened water container.  One to two more shade tents with fans or misting would have been nice.  Allowing low profile festival chairs in designated sections would have been a good idea.  Not allowing in any aerosal spray sunscreen is a terrible idea.One person said it was because they are flammable and another made up some crap about hiding stuff in the can. No, just no. This is Alabama summer. Neither of those excuses are valid. There are people smoking everywhere and plenty of other flammables.  Fans in the Shed would be nice, that place is an oven.  The A/C Iron tents are fabulous. Bars inside and can still hear the music. Totally worth it.  VIP tents have also been packed.  The local artist booths are great.  The lineup has been great.  The food has been great. Overpriced, of course.  The coolest Sloss design that they had for a screen print, they should have put on a cream colored tee.  Survival tips:  Bring a towel for sitting on the grass.   Consider a portable fan or a handheld mister.  Bring wet wipes if you are a lady.  Sandals can work, but unless you know you can spend 10 hours standing on them and walking on them without developing blisters (cough, not that this happened to me or anything), consider sneakers.  Update * They did add 2 additional smaller water filling stations today."

Birmingham,3ds6to,MisterTito,8,Sun Jul 19 19:55:22 2015 UTC,"Random thoughts: Couldn't believe how many people still hold their phone wrong to record video. What was up with all of the sports jerseys?  I enjoy wearing them myself, but they tend to keep heat in.  Answering your questions: For a first time deal, I couldn't believe how smooth everything went.  I dropped a friend off at 2pm right at the gate.  No traffic at all.  I went back home and got dropped off myself around 6.  Again, no issues, dropped right off at the gate.  Got right in, very nice staff.  Even the police working there seemed nice.  So many food options as well!    Iron tickets were well worth it being a ginger and all.  Great to get out of the sun and into the air.  The seating wasn't really very comfortable at all, but oh well.  About the only thing I could recommend would definitely be adding another water filling area.  Does anyone have comments on not bringing folding chairs?  I assumed you couldn't do it since there weren't any.  But it would have made my day so much more enjoyable if I could have plopped down towards the middle and just adjusted my chair to whichever stage had the concert going.  This was my first festival, so I have no idea what to compare it to."
Birmingham,3ds6to,akci,4,Sun Jul 19 06:00:10 2015 UTC,"To answer your random thoughts at the beginning...

Birmingham,3ds6to,akci,2,Sun Jul 19 06:06:16 2015 UTC,The water station is centrally located. It is underneath the road and right by the entrance to the actual Sloss park area.
Birmingham,3ds6to,MisterTito,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:23:47 2015 UTC,Ok that was smart planning on their part.
Birmingham,3ds6to,tuffy11111,6,Sun Jul 19 12:34:32 2015 UTC,"They would have been better served with three slightly smaller ones scattered throughout. Keep the existing one in place, put one in the parking lot between the two main stages, and put one in the park itself. Getting water yesterday basically forced you to miss most of a set. Having a station where you could at least reasonably hear tunes would have been nice.   And frankly, I think they got lucky yesterday that it didn't turnout to be as insanely hot as was predicted. Water lines would have been way worse."
Birmingham,3ds6to,frenchtoastking17,2,Sun Jul 19 12:45:08 2015 UTC,I saw several people with chairs. Some were folded and carried like a backpack

Birmingham,3ds6to,frenchtoastking17,8,Sun Jul 19 20:34:28 2015 UTC,More water. Seriously. It was awful waiting for it. Allowing some chairs - my stepmom came and has bad knees so it was hard for her to sit on the ground. I brought wipes for the bathroom - best decision! Food was reasonable & the shrimp po boy from Phat Daddy's is AWESOME.
Birmingham,3ds6to,sockdologer,7,Sun Jul 19 12:49:20 2015 UTC,When the trains were going by at the end of the night tons of people were running across the tracks while the train was only 30 yards or less away. With all the drunk people stumbling around tonight I can see how an accident could occur if the tracks are not monitored. Even some kids were standing a few feet away from the trains as well. Im probably being paranoid.
Birmingham,3ds6to,madhjsp,3,Sun Jul 19 05:41:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I crossed right as the first train blew it's whistle and looked around to see if there were any cops or security - and, nope, not really. At least, from what I could tell, that first train was going extremely slow."
Birmingham,3ds6to,sockdologer,2,Sun Jul 19 08:02:09 2015 UTC,That train would still run over someone and be a half mile down the track before they managed to stop.
Birmingham,3ds6to,madhjsp,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:46 2015 UTC,"Sure, but if the train is going slow it's not taking anyone by surprise. If you get hit by a train blaring its horn going 10 mph, well, you're special."

Food and beer prices could be a little less expensive, but that's par for the festival course."
Birmingham,3ds6to,gensix,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:27:34 2015 UTC,Was there a rain contingency plan? I know we had a bad storm swoop through yesterday with thunder and lightning.
Birmingham,3ds6to,I_CAN_SMELL_U,4,Sun Jul 19 12:35:12 2015 UTC,"I overheard staff folks discussing the rain situation, so there's some type of plan, but since the weather went around us yesterday, they didn't have to implement it.  Even if not, the spaces under the shed, the highway, and all the tents should be able to accommodate everyone who wants to get out of the rain.   Of course, if severe weather hit, there would be some issues, but that's true no matter what you're doing or where you are. Such is life."
Birmingham,3ds6to,throwinit9,2,Sun Jul 19 12:54:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think the festival actually got any of that rain, it stayed just south of Sloss. I had just gotten there when the weather was starting to look iffy, so I'm not sure if there was a plan. Didn't hear anything of the sort."
Birmingham,3ds6to,jowofoto,13,Sun Jul 19 12:39:36 2015 UTC,"Biggest positives for me personally;  Timing! They're hitting their schedule like black ops. If a show says it'll start at 4, it's into the first chorus by 4:01. I'm impressed by that.  Sound! Getting sound to work outdoors is not easy, but they've done it. Some festivals we've been to used the first acts to adjust the sound levels, and that's just not professional or fair to those bands and their fans. Not an issue with Sloss this year.  Food! The selection is good, and the prices aren't set at amusement park rates. Yes, it's more expensive than getting it outside the festival, but they brought it to you, so...  Beer! As mentioned earlier, yes, it's a premium price. It's not horrible, though, and at least we're not stuck with the usual macro swill that is standard for other events (it's still there if you really want it, though). Starr Hill's offerings are all quite good, and their cherry hits a home run. Their collaboration with Trimtab, Siren of Sloss, is as good or better than anything I've ever had at a festival or similar event. The craft tent had beer from locals that were perfect for a summer day. I think they underestimated demand, though, since it appeared that Trimtab's board was erased around 6 or 7."

Pay extra attention to their Weekly sales (every Wednesday starts a new week for grocery) flier, which features six or seven produce items that are typically proved below $1.29.   Sprouts has incredibly cheap featured produce items, but everything else is expensive.  Coupon. I cannot say this enough. Coupon like crazy.

Birmingham,3dqo62,JDH1234,3,Sat Jul 18 17:40:31 2015 UTC,"Repainting is actually a pretty common practice, but more so in larger metro areas and with bikes that are older. We see this a lot in New Orleans.   Also, since Birmingham doesn't have bike registry folks should register their bikes with National Bike Registry. It's only $10 for ten years of coverage and $25 for family coverage. Any police database can access the information for proof of ownership in theft cases like this."

You're suggesting that a price that you paid for a service someplace else would be the same as some fantasy price that you might pay here if the thing existed. My point? My point is that you can't apply that to mythical fantasy land. Is it likely or possible? Sure. But it's just a best guess.   ...it shouldn't ever be here in the future?    Uber? Probably not if I have any say in it (I don't.) I love the idea of rideshare, but I think Uber's company politics and more make it a boogieman that will keep rideshare (aka, private taxi) handicapped in it's expansion.    The service is great and most ridesharing services are   Uber's not. Uber only controls their company - and their company actions are suspect. And that's just what is seen. Hopefully, more of their shady shit will be shared with the public and they'll go away, leaving room for their less-shady competitors to grow, expand, and succeed without being shitty as a company.    ...unfortunately we won't get it here as long as people like you whine like little babies.   Someone ate a bowl of Little Bitch Flakes for breakfast, I see. I hate to ruin your attack run, but I had nothing to do with Uber failing to be greenlit in Birmingham. That was actually all done by the City Council. Take your ""whining"" complaint to them. I couldn't care less if Uber is forever barred from operating here, but I don't want that to apply to all ride share services - just Uber. Bring on the others!

My girlfriend moved to Bham after getting accepted into UAB. I moved shortly thereafter. Here was my perception profession.  My initial perception: 250,000 population was my guess. Small downtown. Large black population. Lower wage jobs, most likely in the 40k-80k range so a lot of middle class.  After my first visit: Hilly and green. Lots of trees (which was unexpected). I was about right I think in my guess in population. Saw a large black population. A lot of people smoke cigarettes. Lots of fast food places. Loving the green space. Parks, Vulcan, Rufner, ect...  I moved there in April and my current perception: Split economy groups. (Very wealthy, average, and very poor. No in-betweens.) VERY conservative. Small amount of people who are health conscious (20%?) Nice and green. Old fashioned which can be good and bad. Food scene is great! I was pleasantly surprised. Terrible drivers, all of yous'!  I think the city has a lot of potential. What really needs to happen is reform in your government.

It's like a freakin' rainforest in some areas!!  It really surprised me how much wealth seems to be in the city, some of the houses I've seen around town are absolutely ludicrous, and there seem to be a lot of them.  I also wasn't expecting you guys to have such a good beer scene, at all.  I moved from a little college town with an excellent beer scene and I was mourning it on the drive over -- turns out, you guys have it much better here.  So far I've been really impressed at how pleasant and social everyone is here, it almost makes up for their terrible driving skills."

My friends from Germany really got a kick out of how friendly everyone is here and they enjoyed the food too. They weren't as impressed with the beer (naturally) but they LOVED going to the range to shoot. My friend from San Francisco loves the men and my friend from Oklahoma pretty much didn't ever want to leave.

Birmingham,3dmud6,mindshadow,4,Fri Jul 17 15:35:41 2015 UTC,"Valet here: they have likely made a deal with the city to allow them to utilize those spaces (i.e. paid the city handsomely). I believe the intended clientele is the club-goers of the sky bar or whatever that club is up there.   if you've ever been to Fleming's or Village Tavern at the Summit, over half of the parking lot has been blocked off and used by the valets there. So it's like you either get really lucky to find an open public spot, park ridiculously far away, or you're forced to valet. It's likely the same case down in 5 points. Pretty effective business model though, you have to admit."
Birmingham,3dmud6,sexfart,3,Fri Jul 17 18:41:33 2015 UTC,"Right, but the difference at the Summit is that that is private property. The parking along the road is city property. I was just wondering if they kind of set up and was like ""The city will be slow to catch on."""

With that being said UA does have some solid academic programs despite the fact that many of the people who go there are just doing it because they're football fans. I don't really think that's a bad thing, though, since anything that motivates southerners to get educated is good. I just wish these schools didn't have to spend so goddamn much on coaches just to be competitive."
Birmingham,3dlm82,SNOTcorn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:57:28 2015 UTC,Agree and thats very sad. Maybe if more southerners went to school to learn the south could have more facets to its culture.

Birmingham,3dlm82,AlverezYari,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:18 2015 UTC,I actually do think this is becoming a huge problem. The money they are giving these coaches as well is insane. It's definitely starting to get upside down IMO.
Birmingham,3dlm82,AUBeastmaster,4,Fri Jul 17 12:44:17 2015 UTC,"Fwiw the huge contracted aren't paid by tuition or taxpayer money. Often the huge sun you hear about has all the endorsement deals and sponsorships included. You can look up how much actually is paid by the school. It is still a sizeable paycheck, but nowhere near the millions per year advertised."
Birmingham,3dlm82,awayfromit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:00:10 2015 UTC,This. UA receives so much money from the football program. It's a huge cash cow for the university. People think the college floats the bill for the new stadiums and coaches salaries. Donors are also responsible for a lot of the football funding.
Birmingham,3dlm82,daddyfatsax,0,Fri Jul 17 15:37:43 2015 UTC,"Wait... So you are telling me Auburn is not paying Muschamp's $5.1 million contract and his endorsements and sponsorships are? I am pretty sure any endorsements or sponsorships are not calculated in a coaches salary and the coaches salary is paid by the college.   Not trying to be a dick, just curious and also an Auburn fan. I only asked that question because this article from the other day."
Birmingham,3dlm82,AUBeastmaster,6,Fri Jul 17 15:40:51 2015 UTC,"""We put as much (of the salary) as we can on the Tigers Unlimited side because that's where we generate the revenue to pay for that other part of the salary,"" Jacobs said at the time.   The athletics dept. has business ventures that pay for the salary in addition to the university employee salary.  All the stuff like Yellawood, Ford, whatever else you see coaches making an appearance in contribute to that salary."
Birmingham,3dlm82,daddyfatsax,0,Fri Jul 17 16:11:23 2015 UTC,Cool. TIL.
Birmingham,3dlm82,frenchtoastking17,-1,Fri Jul 17 16:19:59 2015 UTC,The problem for me is not the money spent on football.  UA claims that the frats and football dont loose money at UA and that they help fund the cost of education. That might be true but i think more money goes back into those systems than they admit. The bham suburb highschools absolutely do not recoup the enormous amounts of money they spend on football.   Money is not really my concern though. My question is what is the POINT of an academic institution. Do these things really benefit the CULTURE of an academic institution. If there is so much money to be made in football maybe some one should privately start a football team and moneitize it. I dont want my kids school to be in the news more for having a football stadium than for being a school. Why do football stadiums need to be attached to schools in the south?

If I only had a few nights in Birmingham, and a way to get around obviously, I'd hit up Saw's Juke Joint in Crestline (there's a Saw's in Avondale that's closer to downtown, but it's much more limited on space) for BBQ, Nikki's West, Highland Bar and Grill for a more upscale dinner, and Al's Deli late night for some gyros. If you're looking for food on the very cheap or walking only, there are also great options as well.  Sounds like a great adventure; if you want to grab a beer or two, PM me or put up a thread."

There's more to a meal than getting frou-frou farm-to-table ingredients, and late night at Al's is a good place to be. I wonder if you've even been there, if you describe it as greasy. The gyros are quite good. The baklava is quite good. The people watching and company is quite good. Has been for the years I've been going there.  Edit: also, are you saying that a place like Nikki's West doesn't get their food from a supplier like Sysco? I'd wager they do, and it's plenty good. All in the preparation; getting your food from a supplier of food is hardly a negative unless you're paying El Bulli prices."
Birmingham,3dhqo6,yeesCubanB,2,Thu Jul 16 19:56:19 2015 UTC,"Niki's West actually buys local vegetables, they just cook them to death (a delicious, delicious death).  I second Niki's (traditional meat & three + Greek), Saw's (by far our best BBQ), and Highland's (farm-to-table pioneer and James Beard darling). I'd add Eagle's for meet & three (recently featured on Andrew Zimmern). Get the Oxtails.   With those three categories, you've covered the things Birmingham does best. If you want some younger, hipper food, I'd add Carrigan's or Paramount."

It is also much more diverse than the video indicates and pictures of baseball games, random buildings and some trains do not reflect what Birmingham has to offer. Inserting the Vulcan does nothing for the video either. We should acknowledge, instead, that the reason Birmingham is on the map is the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  In the list of gerunds and participles that were used to express what Birmingham does and what the previously mentioned Caucasian population of wealthy individuals do (presumably at 5 Points and anywhere in Hoover), the very fact that the video did not touch upon the very real thing that Birmingham does through its University and medical program is a travesty. Healing, Discovering, Research, Teaching. Why in the world would someone neglect something that has benefited so many here in Birmingham as well as the rest of the nation and world while also slathering penises with both holy and savory gingerbread and molasses. Children's of Alabama did show up briefly in the video, but still, I am incensed as a person who lives and works in Birmingham."" - WarriorHealer  **Here I would like to mention that I would have used 'gerunds and idioms' instead of Participles since they are very similar in how they are used in sentences, though many times not interchangeably.

Birmingham,3deoyx,Chromebuttons99,7,Wed Jul 15 18:08:18 2015 UTC,"You're going to have to elaborate on what you mean?  All of the typical places around town have been all-welcoming in my observation. Unless you're looking for a particular venue in which to do something unusual while also enjoying alcohol.   Paramount is basically a mini-Dave & Buster's.  Collin's Bar has games for use all around the venue, including Cards Against Humanity.   Crestwood Tavern has some shitty regulars and a retard for an owner, but they might suit your needs. They're on the edge of a fairly dangerous area of town, though, so mind what hours you're there.   There's plenty more, but unless you can elaborate on what you're looking to do while drinking, it's hard to give you specific examples to suit your needs. I haven't been to a venue among the popular spots that isn't all-welcoming. (Unless you mean garbage holes like Rare Martini, Nana Funks, Bacchus or whatever it is now, or Tin Roof)"

Birmingham,3deoyx,floppybeef,5,Thu Jul 16 06:35:18 2015 UTC,"It's almost comical and clique-ish. In my thankfully few visits, the patrons are few and far between depending on the day and the hour, but most were pleasant.   They used to have amenities (like free pool on some nights) but that's gone.   They have a bitcoin ATM which is really the only reason to go there - and that attracts all sorts of socially inept pain-in-the-ass patrons.   During one visit, we closed the place down. We made sure out tabs were paid at last call and we were still having conversations outside on the patio shortly after 2. The bartender was finishing her closing work and some moron was leaning on the bar with 2 other people. He clearly worked there (though not that night) or was close to people that worked there because they were closing out the cash register with him locked inside with them. About 2:10, we realized that one of our (female) friends had left her coat inside. We got their attention through the window by waving. The guy waved back with a sneer on his face. We tried to wave him over to the door while pointing at the coat rack just inside the door. He remained exactly where he was and shooed us away, making faces, mocking us, etc. (I wish I was embellishing.) It took us 10 minutes of causing a commotion before someone ELSE came over to the door after we wouldn't stop causing a commotion. Not wanting to validate Capt. Moron's conjecture that we were a herd of drunken hooligans, we were mostly silent as my friend retrieved her coat and quickly exited.   I've worked late at bars. I've never seen anyone treated like that."

When seen at other places in town, he regularly tries to chat up other business owners, all of whom think he totally sucks. Every now and then, you'll see him with a girl, although they are usually the chicks you've seen with other guys who own businesses at other times. There are literally a handful of chicks (probably in any town) that make the rounds among this type of guy, because they think they'll be able to glom on somehow.   He is just one of those smarmy dudes who has a punch me face and probably told on the other kids in elementary school for not being picked to be on a team.   haha, I know how this sounds, but the guy really does suck."

Birmingham,3de0na,southsam,4,Wed Jul 15 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"Really depends on a few things.   What type of tree? Pine is so cheap it'd be pointless to go through the trouble to have it milled. Unless you want to make something that came from your yard. If it's 50+ years old then I'm sure it's wide enough, but can you get good lengths out of the main part of the tree? At least 6 straight ft? Preferably longer, 10ft+ And like /u/derpderpdonkeypunch said, depending on how thick you want it cut, you will need to either air dry (rough rule of thumb is 1yr per 1"" of thickness that you mill it to) or have someone kiln dry it (much faster) before you can even consider using it.   If you still want to go through with it, you can search craigslist for some guys who have a portable sawmill and see what they charge to come to you, I really have no idea because I've never priced something like that out. They may be able to kiln dry it for you too, just depends.  After all of that, you'll still need a good set of tools (jointer, planer, table saw) to turn rough stock into straight usable boards.   Sorry this was so long, I've recently picked up woodworking as a hobby and been researching a ton. Feel free to chime back in with questions."
Birmingham,3de0na,AUChris03,2,Wed Jul 15 17:07:59 2015 UTC,Thanks very much. I've put in some calls on a portable sawmill. The tree fell in a way that all of the upper branches are in the road and AL Power is cutting those off. So I'm left with a white oak trunk about 4-5 feet in diameter and about 50 feet long. I don't have any immediate need for furniture but it's a very very old tree at a historic home and I feel insane just burning it. It would be nice to get some boards made and drying for some feature in the house in the future. Will let you know what I find out.
Birmingham,3de0na,AUChris03,2,Thu Jul 16 13:22:11 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that is huge! Definitely don't burn that, you'll be able to get quite a bit of wood out of that log.

Birmingham,3de0na,derpderpdonkeypunch,3,Wed Jul 15 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"Check with a tree service.  You'll want them to cut it.  Cutting downed trees can be very dangerous.  Friend of mine's dad had his best friend die after a storm when they were clearing his yard.    You're also going to need a place to store the wood where it can air out for a couple years, at least, before you go and make furniture with it."

Throwing this out there - show up right when the DMV of your choice opens so you won't be there all day and bring more than enough forms of identification.   Not sure if it's the same everywhere but the Pelham DMV puts you in the same line as the teenagers taking their driving test so if you're like #50 in line you'll probably be there until noon.  I usually don't mind the DMV experience, because I come prepared and I try to be as polite and patient as possible and I'm usually out of there in a reasonable amount of time, but my attempt to get a Star ID was a total nightmare."

I'm hoping we'll have a good variety of stuff going on for us old hats as well as something to draw people in who haven't played much more than Monopoly.   My sister-in-law will be one of the members of the costuming panel, but I know all three of these ladies and they are all extremely talented.

I think we are doing some Q&A at the panel, but if you have any questions for gaming then let me know (or even send a PM if that works) and I'll be happy to help out.  The costuming should all be brilliant. These ladies have won multiple awards between the lot of them at local cons as well as at DragonCon in Atlanta, which typically has thousands of costumers and half of them competing. Not sure what all they'll be doing, but they are all very approachable and should be able to answer any questions you might have."

Birmingham,3d6vpj,bpittin,3,Tue Jul 14 04:13:17 2015 UTC,That's my experience with them. Either neutral or irrationally negative.
Birmingham,3d6vpj,bhamned,7,Tue Jul 14 02:35:58 2015 UTC,"All of the experiences I've had with BPD have been professional and courteous, and that's why this is so frustrating seeing a BPD officer either completely misunderstand the law, or arrest this guy under false pretenses and then chalk it up to ""disorderly conduct"".  Nothing from the video fits the ""disorderly conduct"" test, so it looks more like the cop was just being malicious in arresting him for knowing that he wasn't required to produce ID during a Terry stop, and knowing that the officer had no grounds to detain him."
Birmingham,3d6vpj,Diactylmorphinefiend,5,Tue Jul 14 02:53:28 2015 UTC,"I imagine that the local officers took a cue from the feds and behaved more aggressively than they otherwise would have.  It's entirely possible that the guy who recorded the video was an asshat to the Fed guys, which would explain, at least in part, how he was treated, but not excuse it.  I'd venture to say that if he recorded the encounter with the local cops, he probably recorded the encounter with the feds. It is also possible that he didn't post that because it is not favorable to him"
Birmingham,3d6vpj,arolloftide,4,Tue Jul 14 04:47:10 2015 UTC,"The article says he doesn't want to post it because it has info for his defense, and he doesn't want to ""tip his hand"" and have his accusers reverse engineer an excuse for him being arrested beyond what they are claiming now."
Birmingham,3d6vpj,Diactylmorphinefiend,2,Tue Jul 14 05:37:51 2015 UTC,"That's horseshit.  It'll be discoverable in a case anyway, so the other side will have access to it or he'd face potential sanctions for not providing it during discovery or upon order by the court."
Birmingham,3d6vpj,OhNoFiveOh,3,Tue Jul 14 05:52:32 2015 UTC,"I think it was implied that he didn't want to explain how the video would be used in his defense, and how he felt it showed he was in the right.  Obviously, the video will be dicoverable and the prosecutor will have access to it.  Putting it on the internet with commentary ahead of time would possibly give the officers a chance  to adjust their testimony to fit the narrative."
Birmingham,3d6vpj,MoOdYo,2,Tue Jul 14 06:18:28 2015 UTC,Don't blame him a bit. A camera is your best defense against crooked police officers.
Birmingham,3d6vpj,OhNoFiveOh,3,Tue Jul 14 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"This is not an isolated incident. I remember filming the BPD beat the living shit out of a man on magnolia, outside pickwick. I was accosted by a plain clothes officer that wanted to confiscate my phone. He demanded I delete the video or I would face jail. He threatened me, telling me he would arrest me for disorderly conduct and public intoxication. I can attest the latter was debatable as I had just left the Plaza and was attracted to the commotion coming from the street.   I can personally attest the BPD is comprised of thugs and criminals that will gladly trample your civil rights, but thats most police departments occupied by habitual steroid abusing jocks. Like any feral animal, its best not to go near them or look them in eye."

Also, on a good sunny day, go to Avondale, they have an awesome place outside to grab a beer, relax and/or mingle. Good People Brewing Company by Regions park is awesome too. Great place to meet people."

Birmingham,3d79zt,datraceman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"Yep. That would be the place, Avondale Brewing Co. Most everyone just calls it Avondale or the Avondale area...  Also, in that Avondale area is Parkside, you can bring your dog there, really cool place. Go there as well...Still, J. Clyde is the best most relaxing bar in town. No doubt.   Hope that helps."

Birmingham,3d59h6,smitjel,4,Thu Jul 16 21:57:27 2015 UTC,"This seems to be getting slightly silly.  I get why it's under review, and I don't really care if they change it, but couldn't they keep the name and get rid of the mascot?  There's nothing racist about the word rebel on its own.  Also, couldn't the image of the mascot be just as much a caricature of Mark Twain or the guy from KFC?"
Birmingham,3d59h6,KenNoisewaterMD,5,Mon Jul 13 18:08:53 2015 UTC,It could be but it's named Rebel Man which kind of rules out that by context.
Birmingham,3d59h6,dabezian,2,Mon Jul 13 18:24:12 2015 UTC,"""Rebel Man"", that honestly sounds like the laziest name they could come up with. He couldn't be something like ""Ronnie the Rebel"" or ""the Rockin' Rebel"" or even just ""the Rebel""? He's not a super hero, so why is he called ""Rebel Man""?   Regardless, They should just get rid of anything imagery relating to the civil war or antebellum era. Just use Admiral Ackbar like Ole Miss joked about in that espn ad."
Birmingham,3d59h6,Zumin5771,2,Mon Jul 13 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, the 1999 class officially/unofficially named him ""Stan the Rebel Man"" so technically he does have a name."

Birmingham,3d540w,Xelliz,4,Mon Jul 13 18:25:36 2015 UTC,We can only blame ourselves.  We voted Roy Moore back into power (by we I mean the stupid people who voted for him - not me) knowing full well his thoughts and intentions.  He was voted back in because of his stand against the Feds and the 10 Commandment issue.  Why would we expect him to change his tune now?  We are to blame.  We are the reason the rest of the country is laughing at us.
Birmingham,3d540w,PayMeNoAttention,7,Tue Jul 14 20:39:54 2015 UTC,It is the general ignorance about the south. And misplaced hatred of Nick Saban.

Birmingham,3d540w,Lnzy1,0,Mon Jul 13 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"The comment about Roy was slightly tongue-in-cheek. (Actually, very much tongue-in-cheek.)

Birmingham,3d31vv,WarriorHealer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"It's not really change. The metro areas are very receptive and friendly to progressive or liberal candidates and have been for some time.  The challenge that DEM's face is in the non-metro areas where voters tend to be less informed, more biased, and solidly conservative for the sake of the conservative values that mesh with their religious values.   Case in point: the turnout for both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in Birmingham during the 2008 primary season. I covered both and it was a highly diverse and balanced crowd at both events. ..which took place in Birmingham.   This is why it was silly as hell to make a futile bid for the DNC as only Huntsville, Birmingham, and possibly Montgomery have a high enough concentration of Democratic-aligned voters to make even a slight dent in the electoral college process."

Birmingham,3d31vv,LaUnika,-2,Mon Jul 13 13:34:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to focus on the self-congratulatory nature of this event, good for you.  In all reality, this is nothing more than a waste of time unless you can convert the voters in the outlying areas. There's a reason you have very little support from the national campaign in this area: it's not a focus nor is it a swing state that could even begin to make it a focus. It's a waste of campaign resources.   As far as name recognition goes, there isn't any and this small turnout (face it, it's VERY small in the grand scheme) isn't anything more than pro-DEM's meeting to celebrate their pro-DEM ideals. (Not that you're alone in that regard, mind you.)   Deflecting the insignificance of this event is just denial. If it makes all of you feel like you've accomplished something, great. You haven't, but whatever makes you get out of bed in the morning is really only relevant to you."

I think Bernie has a better than average chance of taking it.  This time 8 years ago, nobody thought Obama could beat Hillary, but he stepped up his game and fired up the base as well as young voters - much the same way Bernie is now.  The nomination is Hillary's to lose, but right now - she's not really doing much to get the base excited."

Birmingham,3d1old,SPDSKTR,2,Sun Jul 12 23:18:15 2015 UTC,Sounds like a dead alternator. Have you checked the voltage on the battery with a DMM?
Birmingham,3d1old,throwinit9,2,Sun Jul 12 20:34:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's not the alternator, because once I jump start it and take the cables off it runs and drives   just fine.  Good thought though."
Birmingham,3d1old,PandaCasserole,3,Sun Jul 12 20:49:58 2015 UTC,"Really need to check the charge on your battery. Make sure your terminals are on correctly and tight. Loosen the terminals completely and push them all the way down on the tapering of the battery post, then tighten. If it starts with a jump it would seem everything else is fine, need to check that and your voltage. Source: ASE master tech"

Birmingham,3d1old,Blackhelmet233,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:55:03 2015 UTC,It wouldn't jump off if it's the starter
Birmingham,3d1old,all_are_throw_away,2,Sun Jul 12 21:05:41 2015 UTC,"Yes it would. A good way to test this is turning your lights on and have someone check your lights when you turn the ignition. If the lights go out when turning, there is usually a problem directly related to the battery. If the lights stay on when turning the ignition, it can be the starter. Try tapping the starter with a hammer or pole or something similarly weighted , then try to start it. OP says he has already ruled out the alternator and battery I assume. It's worth a shot."

From experience I know that bars during weeknights can get a little loud and hard to hear when people are talking (and on days earlier in the week there tend to be events to draw people in like trivia, etc). Coffee shops can be quieter but some of them don't have a ton of extra seating, so you might not be guaranteed the space to host a few folks, but I know there are some that have plenty of space. The library could be an option - the Bham Public library next to Lynn Park is open until 8pm on Mondays and Tuesdays and until 6pm for the rest of the week.   I work M-F and get off around 5, so I don't mind doing things during the week if they are in the Bham metro area, but I am cool with weekends too."

I'm trying to keep it to nonfiction but fiction is not out of the question. Links go to Amazon, but they are not affiliate links.   The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks - Sounds very interesting, but might be a bit long at 381 pages. Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers - Because I might be a bit morbid, and Mary Roach is easy to read. The Professor and the Madman - I've already read this one, but I'd love to read it again. Great for word nerds. My Life as an Experiment - Because I love A.J. Jacobs, and I haven't read this one yet. Animal, Vegetable, Miracle - Seems interesting, and Barbara Kingsolver is supposed to be a good writer, right? A Voyage for Madmen - Because I just started reading this, and it's hard to put down.

Birmingham,3csuii,SNOTcorn,4,Fri Jul 10 15:27:22 2015 UTC,I disagree. Cable cars would be far cheaper and easier to integrate given Birmingham's landscape.  Birmingham even has a history with cable cars (street cars). A simple system could connect Uptown to downtown Homewood with a single line going down 20th.  And the new bike share hubs could be placed at each stop to enable passengers to easily commute to areas perpendicular of 20th.

I am talking to people about an app that will allow bike commuters as well to track their rides and give data on those as well. From that data the city/RPC/Bikshare can figure out what the most used patterns cyclists take and start working on bike lane infrastructure.

A few major players own a whole lot of that vacant real estate and they're sitting on it waiting for someone to offer them millions for the properties they've left rotting.

I'd like to see more greenery around UAB too. University is a cancer, I wish they'd route traffic towards downtown like on 6th and 4th and take out some of the side streets to make it more walkable.  I also have one specific recommendation too that I always get downvoted for. Get rid of the Southtown projects. That is the first thing visitors see when they visit UAB or downtown from the airport and it is an eyesore and it breeds practically all of the crime in the area (along with the west side of Green Springs). I understand that some good people live there. But if we had developed a timeline to move people out 5 years ago, we wouldn't be in the current situation of having a brand new medical center built across the street from a WW2-era housing community.

I would love for them to be relocated somewhere/anywhere and for that property to be transformed into a park/stadium or something more conducive to growth downtown. Maybe even a school?!? All of the areas around that property are vibrant, growing communities, but the growth and property values are hampered by the eyesore of old rundown government housing."

They have a lot of equipment and it's all pretty nice.. It could get busy, but mid morning or mid afternoon was quite manageable.  There were a few meatheads who felt that they should be able to lock down a whole wall of equipment (Walking over from 4 machines away: ""Hey, bruh - I was still using that machine.. and this machine.. and that machine over there..""), but I'd generally just leave my earbuds in, smile, nod and indicate I'd be done shortly and didn't have any real issues - just a bit annoying, but nothing major.  Also, I felt the Shades Valley to have nice diversity - people of all ages, walks and skill level...

I relatively recently moved out a bit and started going to the 280/Greystone location, which I admittedly like a lot less (and am now considering just buying a home universal instead).  The workout areas are much smaller... The equipment doesn't seem nearly as nice, new or as plentiful... It's seemingly very busy all hours of operation every day (getting equ can be a pain).. .And there is noticeably less diversity at this location than the Shades Valley one.  For about 9mo straight, I was going to the Shades Valley location 4-6 times a week - weight training for about 30m and running about 30... At the Greystone location, I find it hard to get a quality workout done in the same period of time as I often have to wait for equipment or dramatically change my workout due to the crowd (many of who come in large-ish groups and occupy sections of equ in rotating groups)...   Because of my experiences, I somewhat fell off of the workout wagon for about 3 weeks (a big no-no, so far as getting started and keeping motivated is concerned) - only recently resort to just running around my block and doing free resistance training in my house to avoid going to that Y...  So.. All of this goes to say 1) The YMCA can be great 2) Each YMCA location is different, so check out the branches you have access to during different periods of the day to make sure it fits you."

If you're looking for a more normal corporate gym, they all kind of suck equally, and there's nothing particularly close to southside that I am aware of.  If you are employed by UAB, a UAB alumni, or employed by UAB, then you can get a membership at their recreation center, which, form what I hear, is the newest and nicest gym in town, and right off University in southside.    There's also the Jewish Community Center off of Montclair Road, which is what I'd probably go for if I was going to join a gym even though I'm not jewish or religious in the slightest."

It's a nice facility, and it's not an issue that often, but it does happen.  Homewood has the nicest gym in my opinion. It's small (because it's limited to Homewood residents) but it has two power racks, a Smith machine (if you're into that, I'm not but whatever), and a lot of other nice stuff."

Gym memberships vary so much based on location (my gym in Tuscaloosa was $90/month, the one here is $150/month, my buddy's in Greenville SC was $70/month), and some gyms just charge more (Iron Tribe is $325/month). There is some training aspect to it with the coaches, but what it comes down to really is just that people are willing to pay it. I love it, but I certainly wouldn't pay much more than $150 for it"

Birmingham,3cpknl,orlando-bound,8,Thu Jul 9 19:22:37 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, it's a much faster moving drive if you go through Atlanta and go straight down I-75. So long as you don't go through Atlanta in the morning and don't go through downtown, it's smooth sailing.   Going through Montgomery down 231 to I-10 to I-75 is technically faster, but I've learned you can lose a lot of time in Troy, the various speed traps, and traffic in Dothan can be a bitch because there's 2 main roads, the loop and the cut through which has a million red lights.   Considering you can safely go 80 down I-75 without getting a ticket it's faster."
Birmingham,3cpknl,datraceman,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:41:46 2015 UTC,faster moving drive   Is this the same as a faster drive?
Birmingham,3cpknl,WarriorHealer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:21:12 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  If a drive takes less time than another route, but driving the actual route it makes you feel like you're getting nowhere, then you have a faster drive, but not a faster moving drive."
Birmingham,3cpknl,jaynay1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:26:33 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  As long as it's different than a ""faster stationary, not-going-anywhere drive."""
Birmingham,3cpknl,WarriorHealer,5,Fri Jul 10 14:35:00 2015 UTC,I'm originally from Tampa and I've done the Tampa to auburn trip close to 100 times in college taking 280 to tifton and getting on 75 from there.   I much prefer the bham - Montgomery - dothan - tallahassee - etc. Route. I definitely like not going through Georgia. The whole damn state is a speed trap. But I appear to be in the minority on this one.
Birmingham,3cpknl,tuffy11111,4,Fri Jul 10 04:31:23 2015 UTC,"I live in Tuscaloosa but I'm from Orlando. I've taken both routes and I 100% prefer going through Atlanta and down 75, then getting on the Turnpike. The scenery is better if you go through Montgomery, but there are a lot of small towns where you go from 60+ to 30 mph....every 20 miles. Just kind of annoying if you're trying to make it quickly. Also lots of dead zones for cell service in case something happens.   Southwest does have round trip flights for $222 if you book on the wanna get away option. If you're only going to Disney parks, you can stay on site and eliminate the need for a rental car."
Birmingham,3cpknl,ecokitty,3,Fri Jul 10 02:34:15 2015 UTC,The shortest drive is actually down 280 all the way to I-75 in South central Georgia. It is the same time or shorter than the other routes and the shortest mileage.
Birmingham,3cpknl,bosshawk1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:58:52 2015 UTC,This one 100%. I'm from Orlando and have made the drive dozens of times. This way is always the fastest and you avoid nearly 100 miles of extra road to drive if you were to go through Atlanta.
Birmingham,3cpknl,fishbulb323,3,Fri Jul 10 14:29:37 2015 UTC,I think you need to drive south.

Birmingham,3cp3c6,caldwellesq,3,Fri Jul 10 07:10:57 2015 UTC,"As /u/CarrieBHS stated, Highlands Bar and Grill for the nice dinner.  If I could choose only one restaurant in Birmingham where you were guaranteed great service and great food every single time, Highlands would be it.    In terms of other places to eat for lunch/dinner: El Barrio (the chile relleno is spectacular and they have a great burger), Saw's Soul Kitchen for lunch or a pre 7:00pm dinner (Hole in the wall, less seating, expect to wait in line to order) or Saw's Juke Joint for lunch or dinner in a more traditional sit down environment with air conditioning and such (order the smoked wings to start with, and at least one of you has to get the pork n' greens on grits.)  If you want dim sum, a place called Red Bowl serves dim sum saturday and sunday, from 10a,-3pm only and it is quite good.  If you want very good authentic chinese food, go to Red Pearl.    Breakfast is harder to do well in this town and, quite frankly, as a brunch town, Birmingham sucks.  There is a place that Just opened called Buck Mulligans that has a limited, but reasonably priced brunch menu that looked quite good and I may very well wind up there myself some sunday morning.    For beer, don't miss Trim Tab brewery and Good people Brewery.  if you want a place with a lot of taps just to drink, Hop City is the place to go.  if you want food with your beer, J Clyde is good, as is 5 Point Oyster Bar and Public House."

But seriously--one of my favorite brunches anywhere.   Brick & Tin in Mountain Brook also does a very good brunch without the hassle of Trattoria's line (it isn't quite as good, though). Haven't tried Galley and Garden's brunch, but it looks promising. Dyron's Lowcountry is solid, if expensive. Cosmo's is fun, and surprisingly good, if you don't mind the sloooow service. El Barrio does an interesting, Mexican-influenced Saturday brunch.   Breakfast is a little harder. Trattoria does a good breakfast during the weekdays. There's also a number of bakeries for pastries and coffee (my favorite being Birmingham Breadworks)."

I didn't know Brick and Tin did brunch, but I love that place, so I'll definitely try that out!  I've heard good things about Galley and Garden, but it is pricey so I haven't been yet.  Dyron's is very good but, as with Garden and Galley, pricey.    I refuse to go to Cosmo's based on the 45 minutes my table was ignored on a visit there years ago.  They seem to pride themselves on the non-service, so I don't go there.    I went to El Barrio for brunch once and the shrimp and grits were just... odd, and not in that pleasing way.  It was more in the ""who would think this is good?"" kind of way.  I still love them for lunch/dinner, but I more than likely won't be back for brunch service.    I just wish Saw's still did brunch.  They had a great menu but discontinued it because people kept coming in and being mad that they couldn't get the regular menu."

Birmingham,3coor8,Biggame34,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:14:47 2015 UTC,"I know you are looking for new furniture but I have a great leather sofa, love seat and club chair that we bought new about a year ago for $4,000.  it looks as good as new, seriously no scratches or damage.  We now have a 7 month old and cool stylish leather furniture is not the necessity it once was.  Additionally our living room is overcrowded with pack and plays and sleeper beds and baskets of toys and all of that stuff. I would be willing to sell some or all of the set for a very fair price. If you are interested PM me and I can send you pictures or you can come check it out."

According to the landlord's website, rent is about $510/mo., plus an additional $65/mo. for all utilities except electricity. Power can range from $100 to $200 per month because the buildings are historic and therefore poorly insulated. Internet will set you back about $50/mo. too. So you're looking at about $825."

I never asked them to do anything, and I'd prefer not to pay for the things I didn't ask for or consent to.  Honestly it gets really old because the government creates a lot of problems whose solution seems to almost always be more involvement of government. As in: the government is involved in almost every aspect of our daily lives and our society still has all these problems; maybe we should just try less government and see if that helps.  The sad part is that even offering the idea of less government tends to get lots of negative attention despite it being a realistic option to make society better."

There are many unforeseen instances that can occur that would make even you grateful for the services that the government provides.   What's the saying?

Birmingham,3cjzdc,pastorjoebob,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:31:32 2015 UTC,That is just a strange way to justify government; by using implicit permission you would also be condemning battered wives and abused children who didn't leave their bad situation immediately and therefore implicitly agreed to be abused.  In any case I just don't want the government taking charity donation by the point of a gun and calling themselves generous... because the government is quite literally generous with other people's money.
Birmingham,3cjzdc,Ben_Afflock,2,Thu Jul 9 01:59:54 2015 UTC,"Nope. That analogy is faulty and incendiary. You willingly and intentionally take advantage of government services. And, all the while, you proclaim that the government shouldn't provide such services. Does the battered woman intentionally get beaten? Does she intentionally ram her face into her abuser's fist?   Government services aren't charity.  If the government doesn't exist for the betterment of its constituents, then why does it exist?"

Birmingham,3cgxoj,bfrcs,2,Wed Jul 8 00:31:13 2015 UTC,Hahaha I was waiting for some one to say something about that. My apartment is weird af. My washer and dryer are in my kitchen. You can't leave baked goods on top of the oven to cool because they'll stay hot too long and dry out and I have limited counter space so much of that is being used while backing. That leaves my washer and dryer to be used as temporary counter space lol

The reason for this is because it's simply not worth their time on a cost/benefit analysis. They specialize in 18-wheeler accidents, airplane crashes, and class-action pharmaceutical claims (i.e., really complex litigation) and they're pretty damn good at bringing those types of lawsuits.  A simple overtime FLSA claim just isn't worth their time when they specialize in bringing lawsuits with millions of dollars in damages.  In summation, go with one of the small, solo practice guys."

Guy has been tinting for 30+ years with reasonable prices.   edit: If you can operate a razor blade and a spray bottle tint is easy to remove if its not the cheap purple tint from chain stores. Just start at one corner peel it up. Then clean the glue using a razor blade scraper and soapy water. DO NOT do this on the back window if it has defroster lines. For the back if you do have a defroster use some steel wool or something if there's lots of glue left.

Although the upshot of Valley Avenue is that area is where the majority of the city's good, authentic ethnic restaurants are located (e.g., Red Pearl and Gordo's).   I'd look in Highland Park, Southside, and Forest Park/South Avondale. Should be some stuff around $500."
Birmingham,3cbv2h,Geeky_Frignit,3,Mon Jul 6 19:24:27 2015 UTC,(1) safety concerns   I believe this apartment complex has caught on fire three times since I moved to Birmingham in 2000.

Birmingham,3cbv2h,DemonCipher13,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:11:33 2015 UTC,"Should be some stuff around $500.   Jeez, where were you seeing $500 in the Highland Park area? I'm in a 1BR for $665, and my landlord is being kind and not forcing me to pay the increased rates (went up a few months ago to $695 or something)."
Birmingham,3cbv2h,DemonCipher13,5,Wed Jul 8 19:56:17 2015 UTC,"From experience, you wanna aim for a complex in or around Highland Park.  Safest neighborhood in the Metro, easy access to everything, walking distance of everything downtown, especially.  There'll soon be a Publix downtown, as well (6 mos.~) that will make grocery commutes much easier.  Prices are largely variable, but I pay $530 a month for mine and it's been by far, above-and-beyond the best I've ever rented.  Southside will come up a lot.  It's hit/miss in regard to safety.  Has the convenience on it's side, but that's about it.  And most apartments I've seen (and lived in) are subpar, especially for the money.  Price is relatively low, $475-600, depending on where/who.    Farther than that, you have Green Springs, which is a big no-no, I think.  Lakeshore, which I've heard pretty good things about, although the distance accompanied with the traffic can be very stubborn, sometimes.  Then, if you want to miss downtown, completely, Hoover - 15 mi. south of the metro - has a lot of options, but they are generally more expensive."

Birmingham,3cbv2h,dyslexda,2,Mon Jul 6 19:05:02 2015 UTC,"I think Highland Park is actually more convenient than Southside. Both neighborhoods are about equidistance from Five Points and Downtown, but Highland Park is closer to Lakeview, Avondale, Forest Park, and the villages of Mountain Brook.     Generally speaking, though, Southside is more affordable."

Any chance you're willing to spill your apartment complex? I'm in Highland with a 1BR, paying $665/mo, and that's below what my landlord currently charges (upped it to like $695 a few months ago).

Yes, Highlands, Bottega and Chez Fon Fon, but those are a ""who's who"" of fratty/sorority people of various ages; for that reason can be less than desirable to visit (despite the fantastic food).   The same guys that do El Barrio (awesome) also have a daytime place called Trattoria Centrale and another bar with [real] food and VIDEO GAMES called Paramount. If you go to Paramount at the right time, you can avoid the bow-tie wearing banker set (that sucks) and meet some people that do Birmingham proud.   The Red Pearl is an authentic asian market/restaurant/bus stop/ western union that has awesome food, but is quickly being mobbed by the white-bread types who think they have 'the best egg rolls'.   Railroad Park seems like it doesn't belong in Birmingham, but is actually one of many steps in the right direction for a city whose history (and some of it's present) are famously regrettable.   Just don't speed through Mountain Brook, they don't have anything better to do than pull you over and write tickets. Don't expect traffic to be good (there is no shortage of over-privileged teens in SUVs) and a healthy population of idiots looking at their phones who make driving a little scary. Also, try to avoid 280 at all costs- it is a Birmingham slice of all that is wrong with America.   Other than that, explore this city. There is plenty to admire, even more to avoid and no shame at all in calling it home.   Srsly, El Barrio FTW."

One of the reasons the Avondale neighborhood was able to build so quickly was the brothers' ability to gloss over the details and just push. It made the neighborhood desirable for other ""rogue"" businesses (disclaimer: like mine) that wouldn't have been able to cut through the red tape elsewhere.  Ignoring the details up front leads to a bigger mess to deal with later, but I don't think they could have gotten off the ground any other way. I think they'll sort it out."

I've got lots of forgiveness for places like this that at least get the doors open and get things started. There seems to be lots of room and lots of continued improvements on the way, so let's hope it all pans out.  As of Saturday, it was very sparse but clean looking - as if they finished the seating, the bar, and the kitchen and decided that it was worth getting the doors open over creating ambiance.

With the exception of two roads it seems that every street is on some kind of an incline. Downtown is really easy to ride in and a lot of fun. Anything south of red mountain is difficult and not recommended unless you are an experienced road cyclist. The bus system gets a bad reputation but I've taken it a few times maybe once or twice per month and I have never had a bad experience. they have never been rediculously late like people will tell you, their always clean, and cheap (1.25) way nicer than the Marta in Atlanta imo."

Birmingham,3btmie,skarulid,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:09:55 2015 UTC,"I see it as a way to boost the economy.  I don't know what the problem with poor people in rich neighborhoods would be.  I mean there are already poor people that go to rich neighborhoods looking for work as is.  I usually see this in forms of people collecting pine straw, cutting trees, or offering other home maintenance services.    About 5 years ago, there were some guys that would drive around in an old beat up pick up truck with chainsaws and ropes.  They would knock door to door offering to cut down trees that were ""dangerous"" to your house.  About a week later, there was a wide spread rumor that there were people running around in the neighboor pretending to cut people's trees, but they were actually robbing homes.  I'm pretty sure these guys weren't robbing homes, although they could have.  They cut 3 large trees in my yard, and took it as firewood.  On the other hand, there could have been a well to do lobbyist in the neighborhood who started the rumor to try to make people think that poor people aren't safe and to keep them away from our neighborhoods.    My mom went to some women's safety thing put on by some ""police/security"" officers.  They said at the mall that there were men that would slash people's ankles at the mall as the woman was trying to get into her car, and then they would rape them in their own car and leave them for dead.  It bothered me that my mom heard this about 2-3 years ago, and claims that a police officer said this.  She even claimed that the officer said the ""Brookwood mall.""  This is highly illegal to do too.    It's not just the south.  It's also the west too.  Understand that Alabama is a lot different from Georgia too.  I think there are a lot more open minded people in Alabama than most other states, despite skewed statistics and popular beliefs."
Birmingham,3btmie,typie312,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:32:47 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone, I thought I would follow up with an update on my personal experience with public transportation so far. I hope that this thread will continue to grow as more people share their own experiences as well, since so far the responses have been helpful.  For those of you who haven't already, I recommend giving the DART trolley a try. Disclaimer: I've only tried one line (the Blue, which runs North to South) and service may vary day to day, so your experience may not be exactly the same as mine. However, it might be worth trying on a weekend when you have some spare time to see if you like it, or when you're not in a huge rush. The DART runs Mon-Sat from 9, 10, or 11 until 12am depending on which line you are on. I think the service has potential and I hope that the system will be further improved as it gains more riders. The DART probably doesn't come as often as it claims (every 10 minutes, as stated on the brochure, is too vague of an estimate, imo). However, I found that it is a bit more reliable than the other buses. The routes are actually very convenient, and I think the North/South line is useful for getting to Five Points from the loft district/Southside."

There's going to be less traffic in the city than other urban areas, but I would rager that drviers are less accustomed to bikers. Also, the city has very few bike lanes.

Usually they are looking for three times the amount of rent in income when you apply. So you're right around having the income for a nice studio apartment. I do this all day every day. Call me at 205-440-2347 if you want advice on it or to see what we've got to show at RentMonster. And if you don't, good luck with the move anyway! I have a lot of friends that work at St. Vincents.

If you REALLY want to campaign for Bernie, you need to get out into the rural areas that are traditionally red through and through. Self-gratification in the metro area is cute and also useless.   If you're serious about promoting any particular candidate, get out of your comfort zone and make the drive into the boonies. THEN you may attempt to affect real ""grassroots"" change.   Having a meetup with like-minded people over a beer is pretty damn slacktivist."

Having rallies all over Birmingham and Huntsville are cute - if those two cities can carry their counties and the entire state.  They can't.   And this isn't just true for Sanders.

I've covered campaigning before and I've interviewed political strategists and candidates.    If the candidate doesn't bother campaigning personally in your state, they consider your state a wash and irrelevant to their campaign. If you can't convert the predominantly conservative voting counties in your non-conservative favor, you're wasting your time. Yes, I said it. You. Are. Wasting. Your. Time.  Awareness, grassroots, etc are all just fancy terms for self-gratification. It's a no-brainer that you're going to find voters who will find Sanders appealing in the metro area. You can probably get that vote without a single meetup or conversation. You need the votes from the undecideds or straight-ticket conservatives in the rural counties. If you're not gearing up to pound those gravel back roads in the boonies (while also facing bigotry and intolerance as you campaign on his behalf,) then you should really just pack it up now.  If you REALLY want your candidate to win (and that's a long way away and will take a great deal of effort to overcome Clinton right now) then you should just move to a swing state and register to vote.

This kind of attitude and behavior is exactly why your little venture is doomed to failure - you don't react well to criticism. You think I'm patronizing? Just wait until you wade into unfriendly territory. If you want your candidate to succeed, I'd advise excusing yourself and those that think and behave like you do because that kind of reactionary snapping will alienate the very people you're going to need to persuade to vote for your candidate. In short, I challenged you and you responded EXACTLY as I expected - you attacked back and insinuated that I'm too stupid to know what's really happening behind the scenes.   I VERY MUCH assume that you're not prepared and uneducated because you've already screwed up by becoming combative. What's going to happen when you travel out into the VERY rural counties with your message? Are you aware that the rural residents typically have a defensive attitude towards non-conservative politics and candidates? Are you aware that those residents resent people who look down on them or perceive as acting smarter or pretentious?

If you just want to have a pep rally with friends, then stay the course and meet up over brews and talk about how awesome it would be if you could manage to affect change. It's similar to stoners getting wasted and talking about grand plans for business and band names.  But if you want to see change, you're going to have to devote lots and lots of time persuading people who basically think that the liberal Democrat is the downfall of the nation and their way of life.  How will you counter that? How will you respond when they verbally assault you and threaten you? If you think that won't happen, you're naive and have no experience in the rural areas."

For clarity, when I say that I don't share all the mainstream ideas, I mean to say that I'm not easily taken in by the race baiting shit that is prevalent in our culture. My general thoughts are that everyone ought to enjoy the same basic rights because we're all people in this world and no one chose to put here/what color to be. But, most of the narrative that we're fed of who did what, why this happened, etc. is driven by some agenda that is rarely ever about equality and love.

I then stayed single for 10 years. In that time, I experienced dating in this area. It wasn't a very pleasant experience because you would either go out with friends and become one annoying drunk guy's favorite person or be totally ignored. I've always been more of an introvert too and that made it more difficult. I've had my fair share of blind dates too and they were usually horrible. I did better when I joined a dating site. I had mostly positive experiences, which including meeting my husband. You are basically requesting the services of a matchmaker. No big deal!

Birmingham,3blkv3,An_Indian_,3,Tue Jun 30 05:38:29 2015 UTC,Taj posted on FB that they'd be closed on Monday night for the repaving.
Birmingham,3blkv3,southsam,2,Tue Jun 30 13:24:55 2015 UTC,the entire parking lot was blocked off. looks like new asphalt and paint. probably just that since there isn't much parking in that area.
Birmingham,3bkr5t,VerbalConfetti,3,Tue Jun 30 00:51:40 2015 UTC,There has been a rash of CC skimming going on in the area and I believe that once a station finds one they shut the pump down until they fix the vulnerability.

Someone told her the gas prices are about to go up but I haven't heard that from anyone else.  Will definitely be keeping a close eye on the bank account though."

Birmingham,3bjjk8,denaligeneral,3,Tue Jun 30 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of questions.   You can pm your reply if you want.     What department do you want to work in?   Do you know anyone in the department?  If you know someone in the department it's really easy to get a job.   Have your contact drop your name in their manager's ear and they can pull your application.   Doesn't matter which department you've applied to.   The manager can pull just your name and hire yiu from there.  My manager does it all the time.  It's often what I suggest to people who want to work at UAB.     You have your BSN so it's that much easier as UAB is moving more towards BSN over ADN at the moment.    Do you have your PALS, ACLS, BLS,  etc?   If not its not that big of a deal as most new grads don't have them and they will send you to class to get them before you start working.    Best of luck!   On mobile,  hope the formatting is Ok."
Birmingham,3bjjk8,magischthis,3,Mon Jun 29 22:06:43 2015 UTC,"The problem is my lack of connection to someone at UAB. I realize it's a lot about who you know, and I wish I had a way to drop my name in the manager's ear. I am looking to work at a critical care setting, however as a new grad, I am not picky by any means.   My passion for nursing comes from the love of how honest communication is in a hospital setting. It is the only place I feel life is at it's fullest, with all the ups and downs, right in front of you. I cannot wait to be a part of this.   I do not have any of those certifications yet, but I do know they are fairly easy to get. I have been told many hospitals send you to a class before so it doesn't really matter.   If you have any contact information, please let pm me and let me know!"
Birmingham,3bjjk8,fetalbeej,2,Tue Jun 30 02:27:02 2015 UTC,I work in one of the ICUs and can possibly give you some insight there on the different ones. have a few friends spread out throughout the hospital too so depending on your interests I can ask around if they know of openings (ICUs bring new nurses in all the time as others go out to move forward with school). send me a PM and maybe I can help some.
Birmingham,3bjjk8,magischthis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:40:37 2015 UTC,I don't really know anyone upstairs but if you're interested in the ED it can at the very least get your foot in the door.

Birmingham,3bjjk8,lucas322,3,Mon Jul 6 15:46:15 2015 UTC,"Alright - I can help you get hired. What they don't tell you in nursing school is that in order to get a job, you have to contact the right person. Most hospitals, especially big ones like UAB, have a person or persons who are nursing recruiters. They have one job, and that is to find you a job in the hospital. I would recommend contacting them, having a preliminary interview with them and discuss the style of critical care nursing that you feel fits you best, then they can help you get an interview with units that fit your interest that have a need. I will message you the names of the two that I worked through. From personal experience, I have recommendations and also units that I would avoid, but I won't air that on public forum either. If you have specific questions, can't figure out who the nursing recruiters are, or have questions about units you may be interested in, feel free to PM me."
Birmingham,3bjjk8,Vultureinvividcolor,2,Tue Jun 30 04:53:42 2015 UTC,I'm a pharmacy technician at UAB and got hired quickly because of a close connection with another tech. Connections are everything. Having a BSN will certainly be advantageous for you. I'm sure you've visited the careers page but if not here's the link. Best of luck!
Birmingham,3bjjk8,vulcans_pants,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:32:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the link. I have been on the website everyday, checking on new positions and applying for them as well.

Birmingham,3bjjk8,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Tue Jun 30 02:22:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a PCT in RNICU. We've always have RN positions open often because a lot of our nurses work, get their MSN online and move on to a practitioner job or similar. Our nurse manager also hires new grads often. Keep an eye out and keep trying!"
Birmingham,3bjjk8,ericrz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:34:08 2015 UTC,Do you have an email of the nursing manager I could contact? I would love to just personally reach out to one.
Birmingham,3bjjk8,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Tue Jun 30 02:19:09 2015 UTC,"I work at UAB. I didn't have too much trouble getting in to interview. But, that was almost 5 years ago. It really depends on where you want to work. The OR and PACU are looking for RN's all the time. For PACU they want you to have ICU experience. CICU and P7 usually have openings. I think, currently, they are looking for nurse recruiters, too. So that may be a reason it's hard to get a foot in the door."
Birmingham,3bjjk8,WarriorHealer,2,Mon Jun 29 23:03:07 2015 UTC,"Apply for flexi positions. Look up managers on LinkedIn.    Also, why is UAB your first choice? You'd probably earn more from other hospitals and/or private practices."
Birmingham,3bjjk8,RussNP,3,Mon Jun 29 22:16:23 2015 UTC,"Good luck.  I've applied for positions at UAB several times over the last decade.  They have THE most fucked up, labyrinthine, backwards, applicant-hostile, opaque hiring process of any organization I've ever dealt with.  If working there is anything like applying there, it's not a place I'd want to be.  Last time I tried, I got as far as a phone chat with somebody at UAB.  Then they stopped responding, and my recruiter couldn't get anybody to talk to him either.  Two months later they called me back and asked if I wanted to schedule an interview.  I LOL'd and noped right out of there."
Birmingham,3bjjk8,WarriorHealer,2,Mon Jun 29 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"If working there is anything like applying there, it's not a place I'd want to be.   The process of getting in the door is awful, but once you're in, it's a decent place to work -- great benefits, and pretty stable.  Hard to get in, but pretty solid once you get there."
Birmingham,3bjjk8,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Mon Jun 29 22:44:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm used to tech companies (mostly startups) where the interviews tend to be brutally difficult, but they move quickly."

If that is what you want by all means go for it. But I'd strongly consider going through the traditional effort and getting more value out of the property. If you don't want to do FSBO then just turn it over to a realtor. Any commission they take will be less than the discount you'll sacrifice to dump the property ""as-is"".

I started project over two years ago and I feel I have learned a bit in the meantime. I hope this shows in the later episodes. The format is a casual conversation, not Vine length soundbites. So yes, some might be long winded but if that is just the nature of this project as i see it.  I do cut out stretches of dead air and lulls in the conversation, but it is my intent to leave each recording as unaltered as possible.  The intro to the first few episodes had to be re-recorded, as I stated in the intro. The net neutrality issues I am referring to occurred last year.

Selection here is limited because everything is brought in by the state and prices are regulated by that. The best prices you'll find are at ABC stores.  The Hollywood store opens at 10 on Monday and that's when the selection for the week won't have been picked through so if you can be there, be there then.  Scotch gets less attention than bourbon. So you're lucky there.    Your alternatives are primarilyto go out of state. I would suggest Green's or Tower in Atlanta. There are also private groups where you might obtain access to bottles that are harder to find. I would suggest searching Facebook for such groups."

That information is per other ABC store managers that I've spoken with.    When you go in, do make sure that you look on the rail to the left of the bourbon/whiskey shelves.  On that rail that surrounds the office, they'll often put things that they got only a single bottle of and that's where a number of the very expensive or sought after things wind up."

Birmingham,3bgvjz,always_odd,6,Mon Jun 29 02:52:27 2015 UTC,"You'll have at most two options, and it's totally dependent on where in town you move.  The two cable companies in the area are Charter (suburbs) and Bright House (city proper). They are exclusive of each other, so you don't have a choice. I've had both, though, and neither are terrible.   If you're lucky you might be able to get U-Verse from AT&T. It's available in spotty areas throughout the metro. Never had it, so I can't opine. It's just really hit or miss as to whether you can get it or not."
Birmingham,3bgvjz,mixduptransistor,2,Mon Jun 29 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"We have U-Verse here off 280 near Summit.. It's okay, but not worth what I'm paying for it."

U-verse does not offer Fiber to the Premises in Alabama, only to the Node and then it becomes DSL to the premises thus making the Fiber portion irrelevant for the customer. (not sure if you claimed that anywhere, preemptive for those that would)  Essentially AT&T is the worst option for speed and value."
Birmingham,3bgvjz,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:43:24 2015 UTC,"They're a better value, depending on the speed you're buying, than Bright House in many cases. I say lucky because it's always better to have a choice, and if you can get U-Verse you can almost definitely get cable, whereas I live in one of the highest density zip codes in the state and have exactly one option."
Birmingham,3bgvjz,mixduptransistor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:13:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about bright house as I haven't used then in years.

Birmingham,3bgvjz,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:26:13 2015 UTC,"If you don't need 60mbps, though, that might still be a good value. Again, it's just good to have choices.

Birmingham,3bgvjz,Everwinter81,2,Mon Jun 29 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've had no issues with Charter either.   Unless I'm reading the Uverse website incorrectly, Charter's price per Mbps seems to be way better than Uverse, especially after the 1 year intro pricing is over."

Birmingham,3bgvjz,biggestjokeontheduck,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:37:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with the above. If you want to go for Uverse and they try to tell you it's not available in your area, ask your neighbors for a second opinion. I had Uverse for 6 months before my next door neighbor was told it wasn't available here, so I had to call on her behalf and tell them they were wrong. If you go with them, give them a call every 6 months or so and ask them if there is a promo. They will gladly keep you on promotional plans if you're nice and are a good customer."
Birmingham,3bgvjz,bhambetty,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:51:34 2015 UTC,"Uverse has better prices, is generally way more reliable, and rates way way higher in customer satisfaction.   Brighthouse, on the other hand, offers speeds that Uverse can't even come close to touching.   If you are a casual Internet user, Uverse is the the way to go. However, if you do a lot of downloading /streaming /online gaming, you might want to look into brighthouse."
Birmingham,3bgvjz,cherobics,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:50:04 2015 UTC,Depends on the area. I live in Southside and have Brighthouse. I have the cheapest packages for Internet and it's $45. I just use it for Netflix. If you do more you would want to upgrade.
Birmingham,3bgvjz,Sadie_G,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:36:48 2015 UTC,I have charter for Internet only. They'll start you out at ~30-40 for the first year and bump you to 60 after that for 30-60Mbps. It's mostly reliable but sometimes there will be an outage for no apparent reason. I'm in south Shelby county for reference.

Birmingham,3bgvjz,AUChris03,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:55:11 2015 UTC,"So everyone's experience is going to be vastly different based on many factors . . . these factors can include but are not limited to: computer experience, location, knowledge of services, and preference of owning equipment vs renting it.  Basically the fundamental answer is, ask someone who already lives in the area you are moving to and ask them what they use and how they like it because ultimately most people are going to have information that likely will not apply to you.  If you don't know anyone in the area you are moving then please be more specific as to what the area is here. You could get replies here that are from people who are more likely to be relevant then. You could also contact the neighborhood association and ask them if they have any insight.    However, with all of that said . . .   There are three forms of internet here in Birmingham: Cable, DSL/Uverse, Satellite.  Cable is very fast but is more expensive. If you spend a lot of time on the internet this is really the only reasonable option. (this is what I use)  DSL/Uverse is going to be cheaper but MUCH slower and the value drops significantly on the low end. $30 for only 3Mbit is just dumb.  Satelitte is another option but I only mentioned it to be thorough, Satellite internet sucks in speed and price so unless you move to a rural area, big NO on this.   Fiber is a pipedream right now. You may hear people claim that AT&T Offers Fiber but they really don't. Typically Fiber is usually going to offer a baseline of 50Mbit up to 1Gbit but we have nothing like that available in our state. AT&T has Fiber to the Node in our state but the connections to the homes are still either ADSL2 or VDSL and thus not Fiber.     Now for the companies . . .you get what you get, you have no choice of company. You can only choose based on your location, once you move in . . . you have no choice.  Cable:   Charter (my current) Bright House (have used, but prefer Charter)   DSL-ish:   AT&T (have used, worst) Windstream (have used, bad but not as bad as AT&T)   Satellite:   I don't know of one really, but who cares."
Birmingham,3bgvjz,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:38:32 2015 UTC,Att advertises half the speed of charter for half the price. They deliver half the speed you pay for. $ 30 for 1.5Mbits.

So the question is: if Huntsville is okay with it and managed to develop conditions in the legislation that benefited the city, the people, and the business while not generating hatred from the taxi services, what's the problem here?  It's case study, really.   I also like that no one has commented on the post. Especially the ones wanting to call me out for being anti-rideshare (I'm not. I'm just anti-Uber.) So where's the debate?

You have to at least have a choice for it to be a democracy.    The man is 68 years old. He may decide to retire at the end of his term (not likely, but..) at the age of 74. What happens then?

This strategy might not work for most, but for me it does. I work from home and other than waking my dog I only leave the house to pick up dinner, groceries or for family activities. I never, ever go outside of Jefferson/North-Shelby and I don't do Facebook.  Sometimes, when the effort of maintaining the illusion seems too much I remind myself that even though Alabama produces more than it's fair share of willfully ignorant baptists, mouth-breathing bigots and bullies it also produces good people like you and me.

I know my neighbors by name and chat with many of them regularly.   Still, I see your point and counter that one must live somewhere and this after all has been my home since I was born and my family's home for a long, long, long time before that. I was born in Alabama, raised here, educated here and with the exception of three years spent traveling the world as an IT consultant, I've lived here for almost half a century.

Vote and teach your kids to be analytical and well-educated. Teach them to be discerning and to look at issues from a neutral standpoint until they see which side makes more sense.  For example, with the gay marriage issue, there's no reason that it should be a controversial issue besides personal prejudices. There is no rational reason for it to be forbidden in this country."
Birmingham,3batqh,FalconHunter,2,Sun Jun 28 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"...more flies with honey than vinegar...  If you want to move the state in a direction that doesn't make us look like the cliche and stereotype, you need to win over the hearts and minds of the opposition.   Don't agree?   Has it changed your mind when those with ignorant opinions different from yours have attempted to belittle, bully, or insult you? I'm going to answer for you: no. So why would you think it would work the other way around? You can't fight fire with fire - that's the territory of the ignorant.  You need to make compelling and persuasive appeals to change thinking. Passions and emotions run high on so many issues, and with all of the attention on things like these and the availability of social media as a platform for advocacy, you can ""kill 'em with kindness.""  Be the change you want to see and inspire that change in others.   Now - due to the fact that most of the progressive or non-conservative population is focused in the metro areas, you're going to have a very tough time changing the voting patterns of the state as a whole.   You'll need to move into the rural areas in numbers that exceed the hardline, cliche conservative base, and no one wants to do that (even I don't want to do that.) And until you outnumber the rural residents, you're going to see several blue counties surrounded on all sides by dozens of red ones."

Thanks for the interest and support.  This is Ava, she belonged to my friend's ex up until recently. They broke up not too long ago and he told her that he had given her to a friend. She found out today that he actually took her to the Shelby County Humane Society and when she called them they told her she'd been there a month and was not adjusting well and would be put down soon if she was not adopted.  Ava is a sweet girl, I've met her several times and she is not aggressive and is house trained and spayed and has obedience training. She does not deserve to be put down. She has been around kids and other dogs with no problem, not sure about cats.  Her adoption fee is $75, if anyone is maybe looking for a good dog to add to their home, please consider her."

Birmingham,3b3qhc,SPDSKTR,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:24:04 2015 UTC,Avoid Webb and Vail in Homewood. They told me I needed a root canal urgently (went in for jaw pain/clicking). I went to the endodontist and asked him to confirm before going through the whole nightmare and he looked at my X-rays and was so confused about why they would think I needed a root canal when I barely needed a filling. I had to pay $75 for the X-rays and I had already taken a day off work. So I call Vail and Webb and ask if they could see me that day and they said no I would have to wait a week and that they couldn't possibly have known that the endodontist wouldn't need to do the surgery. Excuse me but that is LITERALLY your job. Sorry for the rant but damn. Also I don't know if this is everywhere now but you have to pay extra for laughing gas there.

The only reason the use of this tactic hurt the citizens of this state is because the state refused to help its own citizens by complying with the ACA, so it left a gap in coverage for people that seriously need it.

Birmingham,3aym23,derpderpdonkeypunch,3,Wed Jun 24 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"Right, but the Constitution in theory limits what the Federal government can regulate. I think an argument can me be made that the Federal government is more powerful then the Founders had intended. This is in modern times largely due to power of the purse, and a broad interpretation of the interstate commerce clause (also arguably the development of nuclear weapons). I think that the power of the purse is more abused then founders would have expected because the Federal government has a lot more money relative to state governments then they did in the past. Also, with the development of technology, there is legitimately a much larger amount of interstate commerce then there was in the past.  So, while the original ""States' right"" that was being fought for was indeed slavery, the position of all the States relative to the Federal government is far weaker than it was before the civil war in just about every way.  For better or worse, the various Sates had a great deal more sovereignty in the past then they do today."

No centralized government should be deciding all aspects of lives from coast to coast.   What they want in Texas or Maine might be different than what the people want in Florida or Nebraska."
Birmingham,3aym23,datraceman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:17:25 2015 UTC,"A) People can decide if they want pot locally, as demonstrated by places like Colorado and California. While it may still be illegal on a federal level, enforcement against small time users and distributors by the feds isn't practical. The overall direction leads me to believe that pot will be removed from the federal list of prohibited substances within ten years, at which point it will be up to the individual states.    2) If you're actually comparing whether or not people should have a federally protected right to smoke weed to whether or not a woman's right to get an abortion should be federally protected, then your understanding of the constitution and constitutional law is so tremendously flawed that I doubt I will continue in this debate. It is not my job to spend the hours that would be necessary teaching you not only the foundations and history, but the ability to properly analyze constitutional issues.  The fact that you threw these two things out there clearly shows that you lack both.    3) You threw out abortion, which involves a fundamental right to make decisions about one's own body and what happens to it and then push back and down vote when I compare that to the abolition of slavery? Sorry, son, abolition involved protecting another fundamental right. You also threw in the right to be able to smoke weed, which is not comparable to the right to abortion or the right to be free from slavery at all.    4) If we let locals decide what constitutional protections applied, then there would still be slavery in Alabama today. Our state, outside of Birmingham and Huntsville, is years behind the rest of the country and we have, as a state, been drug kicking and screaming into the current day on a many issues, like slavery, integration, and access to healthcare at a reasonable price, to name a few, by the supreme court, by law passed by congress, or by power vested in the executive branch of the federal government, all of which are supreme to the desires of some Baptist red neck that just can't understand why a black person would be unhappy being property or by a doctor who thinks that a woman that has been raped shouldn't have an abortion but should, instead, be happy that god gave her a ""blessing"" by giving her a child that will remind her every single day of her life that she was raped.    There are many reasons the federal government has supremacy over the state governments, but the one I enjoy most while living in Alabama is seeing the rage people have when they're told they can't legally practice their bigotry on the rest of us."
Birmingham,3aym23,Brackner,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that if states were given their ""state's rights"", places like Alabama would begin slavery again because they could? When waitresses are working for $2.00 an hour and expecting customers to give them additional wages, is that not a form of legalized slavery? When the bazillionaire Wal-Mart hire two part time employees rather than one full time (to avoid those pesky benefits) and pay them less than even a living wage WHILE those same employees must ask the government for hand-out welfare food stamps, Section 8 housing and other ""entitlements"" just to survive, is that not a modern form of legal slavery?  Our prisons are nothing but modern day slavery. Private ""for profit"" prisons that have signed contracts guaranteeing high occupancy rates... you don't think that's a form of slavery? And young prisoners working at jobs for pennies a day making Kevlar and army uniforms so their ""employer"" can compete with the Chinese slaves.... you don't see that as a form of slavery?   And if a woman is raped in Alabama and the people of that state have decided no abortion under any circumstances, there would be no law preventing her from going to a state where the citizens DID agree rape was a viable excuse for an abortion."
Birmingham,3aym23,Lnzy1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:28:16 2015 UTC,"I understand that you think that your comparisons of slavery are important, but they are outside the scope of the discussion thus far and more fit for an entirely separate discussion.    You also apparently fail to understand that an indigent woman may be financially unable to make the multiple trips often required to another state in order to have an abortion performed.  This problem would become exacerbated if states got to decide outright whether to offer abortions since a woman in middle to lower Alabama would find herself surrounded by states that did not offer the procedure under any circumstances and she would have to make an even further trip."

His reasoning: ""Cultural heritage"" Now, though, he has removed the flag everywhere. (http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/politics/2014/02/27/governor-deal-confederate-flag-plate/5870987/)"

However, I do not believe it is appropriate or right for the state to fly it or for it to fly on or in public places. If someone feels the flag is their heritage, that's fine. But I feel the confederate flag is more appropriate in a museum, a place where you can appreciate the historical and cultural significance of it without it defining who we are today."
Birmingham,3aym23,NJWhiskeyHunter,5,Wed Jun 24 18:49:42 2015 UTC,With you 100% here. Perfect post. You have the right to own it and display it on your property or in your home.

I don't support the confederate flag but talking like this is a major national tragedy that is finally being corrected is a joke.   I'd rather after this tragedy us step up about creating gun laws that make sense such as having mental health checks as part of getting a weapons permit. Longer waiting periods on buying guns. Tougher background checks. Also, what kind of parent buys their high school dropout son a gun for his birthday when he has a history of getting banned from a public mall because he was asking people that work there weird questions that bordered on stalking behavior?   Those are questions I'd rather people talk about in the fallout from this tragedy rather than if the fucking Confederate flag is a symbol of racism or not. It is, and most people know it is. Sun is warm, grass is green.  EDIT: To take the conversation further. Since the kid is definitely a loony toon, why isn't the dad being charged with endangerment since he bought his wacko son the gun in the first place?"

I have to laugh, or else I would cry at their stupidity.  I think the reasoning for getting rid of the flag flew over your head (awesome pun). It is about changing the mentality of the people in our country. This flag represents an old oppressionist way of thinking. It's time we move on and get it out of our state houses and into museums, where we can look at it as it should be - history."

So now we have to have a permit from the government to own firearms? What's next, a permit to publish a blog online?   Longer waiting periods on buying guns.   Any evidence at all that waiting periods do anything, anything at all, especially for those that own other firearms?   Tougher background checks.   Pray tell, what else do you want to check for other than criminal history? Check someone's NSA file and the subreddits they frequent?"
Birmingham,3aym23,SushiJo,3,Wed Jun 24 18:46:46 2015 UTC,"To carry a concealed weapon you have to have a permit. If you keep a gun in your bag, under your jacket, etc. you are breaking the law without a permit.   Should you have to get a permit to own a firearm? Fuck yes. I own guns and it's a big responsibility. I think people should have a permit and to get that permit you have to take a firearms safety class which also has a mental health portion to it. I know people who incorrectly clean guns and have no idea how to actually handle them safely who were able to walk in to a store and buy them when they don't know their ass from a hole in the ground.   My guns are well maintained and in a locked safe that only me and my wife know the combination for.  Longer waiting periods will do a lot. Mostly because a lot of gun crimes are spur of the moment decisions. In some states you can walk into a pawn shop or a fucking Wal Mart and walk out with a gun. You put a 7 day waiting period on guns, it allows for spur of the moment crimes of passion to dissipate. Does it stop pre-meditated murder or shootings? No, but it's a step in reducing gun crimes.   Tougher background checks. Arrest records are great but I know of gun crimes that occurred and people were cleared to buy guns who had legally changed their name and the people running the check were too stupid to check back and see the person was a felon who had been arrested for gun crimes under his previous legal name.   Will it solve the problem? Hell no but it will lower the amount of issues we have and make it harder for crazy people to get their hands on a $400 Wal Mart pistol while picking up their anti-psychotic medication on the same day."

Birmingham,3aym23,willco17,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:55:30 2015 UTC,"In the Wikipedia article it discusses many things about the current and former Alabama flags, so I'll link here to make reference easy.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_flag  The thing that I think about concerning the flag of this state is that it is quite literally a red saltire on a white background.   Many hundreds of regimental flags did come and go during that civil war, and though there were battle flags of some companies that were almost that simple, with stars on them too.   I have never found an identical flag used by a battalion and found nothing that has been used for widespread hatred like the confederate battle flag of Northern Virginia and that Tennessee company that was adopted by so many white supremacists and the KKK after the war was over.   They erected such confederate flags on state Capitol buildings and property by white supremacist traditionalists as an attempt to send signals that they were proud and wanted to show they still considered themselves an occupied confederate country.   From studying historic racism, I believe it became so widespread because the second and third/last confederate national flags had this 'confederate flag' of red with a blue saltire and the white 13 stars in the upper left corner of the flag, and because of previous KKK and other separatist white brotherhood use of flags.   I've seen that flag used in running people out of towns (and the police not reporting this! Alabama legally 'has no hate crimes'!) and I am one such person who had such trouble in Shelby county once upon a time, AFTER the year 2000.   So yes, I want such flags to be off state buildings. It DOES seem to be an endorsement to the hate groups and it is a very complex issue, I admit.   I do not have a big problem with them existing as the third/last national confederate flag on the grave grounds of those soldiers, but I don't want to see such flags fly in the hands of bigots and also on state or federal buildings.   Memorials, museums, private property, those contextually tell me where I may be safe to go and where the hell to avoid! :)"

""Who shopped for groceries last?"" and ""Who cooked last?""?  Seriously?  I answered those for you, but it's not like you could glean anything about our household from it other than: as of X date, X person had most recently done this and Y person had most recently done this other thing."
Birmingham,3azajr,derpderpdonkeypunch,2,Wed Jun 24 23:04:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, it was an imitation of a study done in Warde and Hetherington in 1994. They asked a bunch of questions, two of which were who had cooked the last meal and who had done the last main food shopping. Food shopping was shared more frequently, but still done more often by women alone. For the last meal, women were seven times more likely to have cooked it. (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1994.tb00109.x/abstract) Unfortunately, unless you're on a university VPN, it's behind a paywall.

Birmingham,3av4xt,NJWhiskeyHunter,11,Tue Jun 23 19:39:08 2015 UTC,Confused as well. It's a major national controversy and AL.com is informing people about it.
Birmingham,3av4xt,southsam,7,Tue Jun 23 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"Not just that, but it's an aggregation of not only local, state, and regional news stories, but also national and global.   Reuters, AP, etc are all doing stories on it and, just like the printed version, AL.com is aggregating those stories - which they pay a fee to do I might add."
Birmingham,3av4xt,FalconHunter,8,Tue Jun 23 23:09:43 2015 UTC,Maybe OP feels al.com is catering to the sensationalism of a relatively unimportant blip in the conversation of free speech when there are far more relevant and pressing subjects for our state?
Birmingham,3av4xt,nickelsun88,3,Wed Jun 24 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. Instead of worrying about the flag (which I do not support for the record) it'd be nice to talk about actual injustices and instance of racism that deserve attention.   The confederate flag story is a scapegoat for the real problem. The media and politicians can claim they are doing something to stop racism and make everyone feel good about themselves.   Instead of you know, actually having conversations and working towards solutions of the racial problem."

Several board game meet ups around town as well.  Wednesday nights at brook wood mall food court, Thursday's at excelsior and Saturdays at east vintage 59 cafe are the ones closest to you I think.  Friday nights has games at buds place in Leeds that isn't too much farther as well.  I would recommend hitting meetup.com to find these groups and get to gaming.  I personally have been debating approaching a local brewery to see if they would allow a Tuesday night group to fill the gap since mad doctor Tuesday nights are gone now.

You get your vaccinations, some emergency OTC meds for common problems, etc, and they give you a yellow card which some countries need as proof of vaccination.  You most likely won't need the yellow card for DR.

Birmingham,3ao279,artcarden,6,Mon Jun 22 02:30:46 2015 UTC,"Bham officials should note that while they did write rules that would have allowed Uber and Lyft to do business here, they were rules that made their business model unviable here. I suspect anyone who has used both ridesharing and Birmingham taxis would find ludicrous the proposition that regulated BHM cabs are safer and more reliable than unregulated Uber."
Birmingham,3ao279,Letchworth,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:33:39 2015 UTC,What about in CA where the locals put out a law (ordinance?) saying that you couldn't register your taxi employees as contractors to avoid paying their insurance?  Perhaps it is more important for that legislation to be viable than for a company to proceed in life by shortchanging its employees.
Birmingham,3ao279,mixduptransistor,2,Mon Jun 22 12:29:58 2015 UTC,Uber drivers know what they're getting into (source: conversations w/ many Uber drivers). I'm pretty sure this is a way to raise taxis' rivals' costs.
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,-4,Tue Jun 23 01:17:19 2015 UTC,"Birmingham has rules that makes prostitution unviable as a legitimate business, too. Should we eliminate those? You don't automatically have a right to get your way.  FWIW, Uber is operating illegally in Mobile and there is a fight going on now between the City Council and the Mayor, so it's not all rosy and living in Little San Francisco down there, yet."
Birmingham,3ao279,mixduptransistor,7,Mon Jun 22 12:30:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, we should eliminate those laws too, if we really want to reduce the amount of harm that comes from it."
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Mon Jun 22 12:44:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes, because the unintended consequences of prohibition (of drugs, prostitution...you name it) are pretty awful."
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,0,Tue Jun 23 01:10:55 2015 UTC,I agree with you in principle but it must be well regulated. We don't live in Somalia. Which brings us full circle back around to Uber and their wish to be free of all regulation.
Birmingham,3ao279,mixduptransistor,3,Tue Jun 23 01:20:32 2015 UTC,Again with this falsehood.  Ride sharing companies have a long track record of working with cities and states to come up with regulations that work.  Our council simply chose not to do so.
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Tue Jun 23 01:38:33 2015 UTC,"Competiton regulates surprisingly well. The problems the city wants to solve w/ regulation are solved by Uber's feedback and tracking mechanisms and competition from Lyft and others. Additional problems can be solved through the court system as they arise: it's impossible to anticipate and write rules for every contingency, and the sad fact is that a lot of regulation is protection for special interests cloaked in the language of protecting the public. We don't live in Somalia as we have strong property rights and a strong rule of law (which is different from a rule of regulators); we also don't live in 18th century France, and I hope we can see through special pleading that raises prices and limits our access to goods and services."
Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,4,Tue Jun 23 12:15:21 2015 UTC,"Also, again with the ""Uber insists on getting its way lie?  Really?  It has been proven wrong over and over and over and over and over again, but you keep trotting it out.  Uber works with the city governments, when they act in good faith.  Ours didn't."
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,0,Mon Jun 22 13:16:47 2015 UTC,"The Mobile City Council would disagree. Uber started operating before the ordinance was passed. Not exactly ""in good faith""  Edit: And obviously Uber didn't get their way because they aren't operating here."
Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,5,Mon Jun 22 13:49:55 2015 UTC,"Um, they aren't operating here because our city council made a preemptive strike and didn't even listen to what Uber had to say.  That's not the same thing as ""Uber didn't get their way"".  Read Kim Rafferty's leaked emails on the subject, it's pretty clear what happened."
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,-1,Mon Jun 22 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"again with the ""Uber insists on getting its way lie?    You missed this part?   Uber is operating illegally in Mobile   Also,   It has been proven wrong over and over and over and over and over again   If that's such a readily verifiable fact, then you should have no problem linking to indisputable proof of that.  Uber: We ask for forgiveness instead of permission.   Want a rideshare? Sure. Advocate for Lyft? Sure. I'll support you in both.   Uber? No, thanks. I'd prefer they simply go away at this point."
Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,2,Mon Jun 22 16:33:47 2015 UTC,"But they won't :-)  If you want to have ridesharing, you don't get to pick and choose which companies do it.  Either you are willing to make some concessions to make it work (which Lyft and Sidecar, etc all need), or you aren't.  Clearly you aren't.  Thanks."
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,-6,Mon Jun 22 16:36:19 2015 UTC,I don't want Uber or any of it's business practices in my area.   They're shady (at the HQ) and they're not welcome in my opinion.   I like how you avoided the other parts that I attempted to call you out on.   THANKS!
Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,3,Mon Jun 22 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"OK, so you don't want any accommodation for ridesharing because you hate Uber.  Thanks for also blocking Lyft and others because you have beef with one company.  Well done.  This is why we can't have nice things."
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,-4,Mon Jun 22 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"Someone's got a chip on their shoulder.  What, are you mad because you can't score some extra cash on the side?  I don't want Uber here. I want them to fold as a company because I believe them to be shady and corrupt. I have no problem with the ridesharing concept.   Also, I do not sit on the city council nor do I live in a district where I could hold any clout with any seated councilors. I don't see them trying to operate in areas in which they'd actually be relevant, like, Hoover? Bessemer? Trussville? Pelham? Remote areas where people would use them to get into downtown?"
Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,2,Mon Jun 22 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I favor a statewide approach to this question.  Ridesharing services are most efficient when they can operate in a large area.  Right now, even our cabs can't do that.  Say you take a taxi from Birmingham to Alabaster.  That taxi driver is not legally allowed to pick up a passenger in Alabaster and bring them back to Birmingham.  So the cab rides empty, super inefficient.  The transportation regs in Birmingham and the state as a whole are, in fine Alabama fashion, a clusterfuck."
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,-2,Mon Jun 22 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"I can agree with you on this point.   But again, I've lived here 15 years and I think I've taken a taxi once. So what's the big to-do?"
Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,2,Mon Jun 22 20:20:16 2015 UTC,"You want proof that Uber doesn't always need to get their way?  Look at the deals they have struck with dozens of other cities as proof.  But you won't do that, because it contradicts your internal narrative about the subject.  Fact is, our council acted unilaterally and preemptively to keep ridesharing out of Birmingham.  There was no negotiation, and the reason for that is our council."
Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,-2,Mon Jun 22 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"Look at the deals they have struck with dozens of other cities as proof. But you won't do that, because it contradicts your internal narrative about the subject.   How about you point me in that direction. I see that you're ready to argue and eager to condescend - and that's fine - but the nebulous ""go look what they did elsewhere!"" isn't a citation. That's a distraction.   You started the statement by being very nasty: ""It has been proven wrong over and over and over and over and over again""  Really? Then why don't you illustrate that point for everyone instead of the drive-by shaming because people don't agree with you.   (Waits eagerly for ""I'm not your search engine"" or similar distraction.)  One thing we can agree on, neither of us has any love for the Birmingham City Council."

Speaking of cursory research - do you only share references that cast Uber in a positive light or are you willing to share all of the negative ones as well so that people can make an educated decision? Me? I have reviewed the evidence and I'd prefer Uber just stay away. Lyft? No qualms. Hope they're able to implement as needed. (But honestly, who needs this rideshare thing anyway? I've lived here 15 years and taken a taxi once, I think.)  And, since you like to gloss over facts based on your own opinion (of me) you'll note that I stated again and again that I'm anti-Uber, not anti-rideshare.  You're bad at this."
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,-5,Mon Jun 22 20:19:18 2015 UTC,"I suspect that Birmingham doesn't really have that big of a need for a taxi service - rideshare or otherwise. I haven't often found myself in a position where a few bucks on a taxi would have put me out.   Is it that the loudest advocates stomping their feet and demanding Uber and Lyft be permitted in Birmingham are wannabe rideshare drivers seeking extra income or is it that there are that many people around town with no cars and no friends who have no other means to travel a few blocks here and there?   I've heard all of the fantasy scenarios, but outside of getting home safely when drunk or not wanting to overpay for parking at the airport, I really can't fathom a desperate need for the thing.   Commuting to work? Carpools are unregulated and still a thing.   Commuting around town? Are people lacking in friends willing to pick them up?   You give me a non-airport parking, non-DUI set of reasons why this is such a desperate need in Birmingham and I'll listen. As of yet, I haven't heard anything viable and so I choose not to care until someone manages to persuade me otherwise."
Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,3,Mon Jun 22 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"My biggest beef with our cabs isn't cost.  They aren't that expensive.  It's reliability.  They just don't show up.  Just last week my neighbor called Yellow Cab 24 hours in advance for a ride to the airport.  45 minutes after the appointed time they still weren't there.  You ask 100 people that have used Yellow Cab for feedback and you will hear 99 similar stories.  And yes, by the way, there are a LOT of people that rely on our taxis to get to / from work, doctor's appointments, etc.  Go sit outside the VA and see how many times the cab shows up to give somebody a ride.  Not everybody is privileged enough to have their own car or a steady pool of friends willing to give them a lift on demand."
Birmingham,3ao279,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Mon Jun 22 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"Cabs are just a little too expensive for me to use them for more than rides to/from the airport, bus station, etc, but reliability & transparency are HUGE issues. Yellow Cab's app is laughably bad, and my worst Uber ride was better than my average cab ride. I was picked up at the Greyhound station in ATL--which is next to the city jail--in a car that was cleaner than any cab I've ever been in, and the driver had mints and bottled water waiting in the back seat for me--and this was my worst Uber ride: the driver (who was new at this) got just a bit turned around en route to my hotel. That was a bit disappointing, but I'm regularly in cabs with drivers who ask me for directions. Every Uber driver I've had has been super-enthusiastic, including one driver who also had a cab company and another who was an ex-cabbie. I had a Lyft driver once who had switched from Uber, but he was still enthusiastic about ride-sharing.  I was in Charleston in March & took Uber everywhere. I didn't have to rent a car, worry about finding & paying for parking, navigate a strange city, etc; it was GREAT. I'd love for BHM visitors to have the same convenience, and I'd love for people in Birmingham to have the same opportunities to pick up a few extra bucks. And for me personally, I might not even own a car if I had access to ride-sharing."
Birmingham,3ao279,vulcans_pants,-1,Tue Jun 23 01:09:47 2015 UTC,"First section - no contest. I agree with you 100%.   And yes, by the way, there are a LOT of people that rely on our taxis to get to / from work, doctor's appointments, etc. Go sit outside the VA and see how many times the cab shows up to give somebody a ride.   I've never been outside of the VA but that's the first possible example that you've shared that's relevant. But there are other options.   Not everybody is privileged enough to have their own car    When my 15yo car is in the shop, I have to make choices. Then again, I schedule those choices based on what I can do and how I can get where I need to be. I plan. People can plan ahead regardless of their status in life.   ...or a steady pool of friends willing to give them a lift on demand.   I'm privileged because I have friends willing to give me a ride. Good to know. I'll go feel guilty for being friendly, reliable, a pleasure to be around, and caring. Then perhaps I can be as bitter and alone as you - advocating for a crowd-sourced taxi service for some goddamn reason."
Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,2,Tue Jun 23 01:06:14 2015 UTC,"What other options?  Seriously?  If you don't like the service, don't use it.  But this whole notion that you know what others need better than they do is just laughable."

Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,5,Tue Jun 23 01:01:59 2015 UTC,"Why the fuck do you care?  Dude needs a ride, the reason is frankly none of your business.  Maybe he had one beer too many and doesn't feel safe driving home.  Maybe he got into a huge fight with his girlfriend and she left him stranded.  Maybe his car won't start, or he tripped leaving work and hurt his ankle so he can't drive.  There are a million reasons somebody might call a cab, and all of them are no concern of yours.  Why do you have such a problem with somebody wanting to pay for a lift?"
Birmingham,3ao279,vulcans_pants,-5,Tue Jun 23 01:15:22 2015 UTC,"Why do you have such a problem with somebody wanting to pay for a lift?   Because it adds people to the road who are in prime areas (like cabs do in larger cities) waiting for a pickup. Because I don't have a problem with people looking for a ride, I have a problem with Uber itself. Get on the soapbox and promote anyone else and you'll get little resistance from me."

Sounds like ridesharing is really for people who, for whatever reason, like to rely on others to get around. Seeing as how this is Birmingham, it's not really relevant. I can appreciate the need it fills in larger cities, but here? It's like pizza drivers met a taxi service and people are using it in smaller cities simply because...well, I don't know what they'd use if for around here that wouldn't be thought of as odd or weird by most people over the age of 30.  It's only purpose beyond that would be to avoid driving while drunk or avoid parking fees at the airport."
Birmingham,3ao279,FalconHunter,3,Tue Jun 23 04:11:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. Since you can't think of any good reason for people to use a ridesharing service, and since people over the magical age barrier of 30 can't wrap their heads around ridesharing, we should just drop this whole idea.

Birmingham,3an86w,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Mon Jun 22 02:49:08 2015 UTC,That would be great. I'm always looking to learn more. Having even a cursory knowledge of programming is clutch.
Birmingham,3an86w,willco17,3,Mon Jun 22 12:56:27 2015 UTC,"Like /u/willco17 said, Codecademy is pretty good.  And free.  Nothing more than a web browser required to get started.    http://www.codecademy.com/  Coder Dojo also has free sessions, and if you happen to live in a city that has an actual group, they are a great resource.    If you want to learn primarily web stuff, General Assembly has a thing called Dash that teaches HTML, CSS and JS, the basic building blocks of the web.  Also free, also totally in the browser, so there are no complex toolchains to set up or anything.  https://dash.generalassemb.ly/  What's important to remember when you are learning to code is to focus on the concepts, not the language.  Just like Spanish, French and English all have common concepts like verbs, nouns, adverbs, conjunctions, etc, so do programming languages.  Once you get your head around what a variable is, what a loop is, how flow control works, what a method or function is, inheritance, encapsulation, etc, you can pick up new languages very quickly.  If you know the concepts, the rest is pretty much just learning a new grammar for expressing the same ideas."
Birmingham,3an86w,Everwinter81,2,Mon Jun 22 14:46:27 2015 UTC,"Codecademy seems to have a good reputation. I got started on it but haven't done much lately.

The studio I go to (Red Dot Gallery) also has a slab roller and tools for hand building if that's what you'd rather do.  I really like this studio.  The instructor is hilarious and can be as hands off or hands on as you need.  If you're interested in learning ceramics and starting from no knowledge, I'd recommend taking some classes first to see if it's actually something you enjoy.  Wheels for throwing can be expensive and quite an investment.  Kilns are also expensive to run and keep up.  It can also be difficult to make it financially viable as a source of income (as is the case with most any art).  All that said, I LOVE ceramics.

Birmingham,3amnzq,vulcans_pants,4,Sun Jun 21 21:32:49 2015 UTC,"J Crew Factory or maybe Banana Republic Factory is the best answer. Everything in the store is almost always at least 30% off or more. No need to spend $50+, especially on the shirt, or go to a specialty shop if you don't wear stuff like that often.   Even better, look for a good sale on Uniqlo.com."
Birmingham,3amnzq,willco17,2,Mon Jun 22 01:59:03 2015 UTC,"Hell, the shirt I wore with my tux at my wedding was a basic white button up from the J. Crew factory outlet in Leeds and it not only looks great, but I can wear with with my other suits.  It was $34 after tax.     As far as pants to wear to a wedding, both J Crew and Banana Republic have outlets in the Shops at Grand River and will serve OP well if he's not looking to get a suit.    I also highly recommend this cotton/linen unlined blazer from Uniqlo if OP needs a jacket.  For a summer wedding in the south, it would be perfect.  It's breathable, light, have a nice texture, and can be dressed up or down depending on the accessories.  I spent $60 on the blazer and $18 to have the sleeve length adjuster at A1 Reweaving and Alterations in Homewood and am very happy with it.    It's also nice to have a casual blazer that isn't unbearable in the summer heat, and that you don't have to worry about hanging properly so it doesn't get wrinkled.  Wrinkles are part of the charm of linen."

They have a variety of styles, and good fits for a lot of different body types.  I have found their stuff to be durable and well made.    If you want something noticeably better, you are gonna need a tailor.  Baldone on 2nd ave north has a good reputation, and I have heard very good things about Brogue and Cuff in Mountain Brook.  This will cost more than you probably have budgeted, but will last a very long time and form the foundation for a solid wardrobe."
Birmingham,3amnzq,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Sun Jun 21 20:54:43 2015 UTC,"Shaia's, Harrison Ltd and Mobley and Sons are all winners, but unless you hit an amazing sale (worth looking!) I don't think you'll get out in that price range. J Crew Factory and Brooks Brothers (also has an outlet!) are solid quality, but more affordable, options."

Nordstrom Rack is a great place for designer denim that's usually half off (Sevens, Joe's).  Great discounts on designer clothes in general.  You need to shop it often to make the most of it.  Nordstrom Rack and DSW pretty good for deals on shoes.  Shops at Grand River Outlet has brooks bros., Allen Edmunds, J Crew and Banana Republic.  I shop Charles Tyrwhitt for most of my shirts online.  They are terrific quality.  If you're a dapper dude, go to Mobley & Sons."

I don't know what it may have been like in years past, but my first and last visit a few months ago designated it firmly as the worst bar in town with some of the worst people imaginable.   The bartender was nice and pleasant and she apologized for having such a limited selection available. The ""regulars"" that were there either chatting her up or own it, or are part of the staff (they were locked inside once they closed) are some of the most asinine, arrogant morons that I've ever had the displeasure of forfeiting oxygen to.   I sincerely hope something catastrophic befalls that venue in a business sense - At least there are 2 dozen other venues in town to visit that are closer, more enjoyable, and have better selections and patrons.

You get a business loan from a financial institution for around $250-350k. (And yes, you need this much money. If you barely scrape enough together, you will be closed in 2 months. You will not be cash flow positive for a long while. You have to have enough cash on hand to float for a year and spend on marketing/promotion.) You're not going to make money your first 6mos. possibly a year. There's too much overhead and maintenance. You need a building, you have to build out that space, hire a staff, you have to build the machines, buy the equipment, insurance for the business, the list goes on. (Hey, at least there's a Steam sale going on).  Furthermore, given your current rough outline for the business plan, no financial institution is going to lend you that kind of money for something like this.  ""So, you want a shit load of money to open this computer center thing and sell snacks, right?"" ""Essentially, yes.""  ""How much money are people going to pay to come play these games?"" ""They pay $5 by the half hour/pay $25 for a day pass to get in/whatever""  ""If you have only 10 computers, you can only have 10 people playing at a time, and they can spend $25 and sit there all day? That's a maximum gross revenue of $250/day from your main service/product. After payroll, expenses, etc., you've got $125 left. You personally have to eat, pay rent, etc., right? Let's say you take a literal poverty level amount of $50 home a day. That's $75 Net Revenue a day. So at 100% maximum capacity, 365 days a year, which is completely unachievable, you're going to pay back this business loan in 9.13 years?""  ""Did I mention the snacks?"" ""Get out.""  Moving on...  Target Markets  #1 Problem - Literally the only demographic that would seek out a place like what you're talking about is the stereotypical ""gamer"" kid.  ""That's exactly who I'm trying to attract!""  Sounds perfect right? Nope.  So why is your ideal target market absolutely horrible for your business?   1.  If it's a 13-17 year old, this gamer's parents are going to dump them out at the front door, and you're going to be a babysitter. They have no money, and they will run off anybody with any money to spend after they start dropping hard R's into a headset. This happens at literally every gaming shop/cafe at some point. You cannot avoid it unless you just kick them out. Sidebar: - It does not remotely matter who you try to market to. Kids will catch wind of this place, beg their parents to go (or just randomly wander in), and now you're stuck with a bunch of middle school kids with no money to spend.   If it's a young adult 18-25, this gamer already has a better rig than anything you would want to furnish the location with. Also, and this is a big one... The majority of that demographic is broke (College, very little disposable income, etc). They're not going to buy anything once inside even if they did pay the day pass rate/whatever. They're going to loiter. Literally, they're going to hang out all day long and never buy anything except one Mountain Dew. Even if they weren't broke, a gamer is not going to pay to go to your place and pay to play games on a worse rig than they have at home that doesn't have their exact Steam library. Why would anybody do this? Why would I go to a place that is going to cut off the Internet connection to my machine when I'm right in the middle of a game because the time ran out?   Exactly...they won't.   2.  You will never attract anybody that has disposable income to spend. Adult gamers with decent income won't go because they have the income to purchase their own nice rig, and they don't want to be around a bunch of loitering kids.  3.  Any other person from around here that isn't a ""gamer"", as it were, will never pay to go to a place that is filled with ""gamers"". The overall perception by this demographic, people outside the gaming world, is that it's going to be a bunch of smelly nerds and the aforementioned 13 year old kids. Essentially, your target market, even if by some miracle showed up, would actually drive away the possibly of reaching out the other demographics.  Sounds terrible, but it's 100%, absolutely true.   Your typical group of people that are just ""looking for something fun to do this weekend"" would never go there - Even if they're looking to play games of some sort, they're going to be looking for a Paramount or Dave and Buster's experience, not sitting at a PC next to literal children.   Look, I totally get it. I really do. Sounds like an awesome concept. But, every gamer/nerd has had this idea at some point. As bad as we want it to work, it just doesn't. This isn't Tokyo or Seoul.   Sincerely, I wish you the best in making an informed decision. Please, do not take anything I've said personally. I'm just genuinely trying to make an effort to shed some light on some stuff that you might not have considered. This is a rabbit hole that, if you're not careful, will eat you alive in debt, stress, and a whole lot more.   All the best."

Birmingham,3afi9f,FlipBlack,4,Sat Jun 20 16:35:28 2015 UTC,"If you also organized events I think you'd be filling a much needed niche in the area.   If I remember correctly, Steam has a cafe license package that allows you access to x games on y PCs. Consoles are an expensive upkeep because you need to buy multiple copies of each game in order to allow people to play over LAN. A gaming lounge in Raleigh (Eternal Gaming) closed down in part to the prohibitive nature of maintaining consoles.   I think you should consider arcade cabs and maybe pinball machines. You need to be incredibly diverse to draw in enough people to keep your head above the water."

There are plenty of contract repairmen available to address problems within a day or two. Pinball machines are much harder to repair than normal arcade machines (usually) so if that's a concern you could cut pins out completely (although you're missing out on a good $200-300 a week that way)."

No one wants to pay for the time on the machines to make it profitable.  Your overhead will be monstrous compared to your revenue. You'll have anarchists or tinkerers who will do things to your machines that will require regular, expensive maintenance and a dedicated support staff member. Your hours of operation won't be friendly to many gamers. Your machines will either sit empty or be monopolized by a set of regulars.  No matter what you have or how you set it up, you're going to face TONS of criticism from your target market. Gamers love to find something to complain about and then they do it loudly and often until people either stop listening/caring or they actually create a rumor that regular people accept. Two words: Babysitting Service. Do you really want parents dropping off their crotchfruit for several hours so they can be YOUR problem? An we KNOW how well youngsters behave online, don't we? The Deep (a comic/gaming shop in Huntsville) also tried this. It worked out okay for them, but they ultimately stopped supporting it because it was a money pit and it made the venue a really unpleasant place to be for anyone that wasn't on one of the machines.  Food and gaming don't mix - at all. Drinks are spilled, food is consumed with controllers or game pieces in hand, and things get sticky, greasy, nasty and vile.    Thoughts? Just like /u/DrPolaroid said: Don't remotely consider doing this."

I went ahead and checked out Birmingham/Irondales city ordinance regarding dogs barking non-stop. You can find the documentation Here. Once you file a complaint with the city, your neighbor will receive the notice. If they fail to comply, the city will take their dog to the pound.  I had to call the city on my neighbor.

Birmingham,3ad364,RussNP,2,Fri Jun 19 15:38:39 2015 UTC,They do grooming for dogs and they will do cats with a timid disposition.  They do early am drop off and pick up till 6 I think so it's convenient to drop off on the way to work and pick up after.  They do boarding as well if you need a weekend away.
Birmingham,3ad364,allt,2,Fri Jun 19 16:49:29 2015 UTC,"Hello, neighbor.  The closest vet is Vulcan Park Animal Care, just barely on the other side of the mountain.  No Expressway driving required!  They are super chill and do daycare and boarding as well.    On that note, I can't really recommend Dog Days on 18th Street at all.  I sent my dog there for grooming, and she was attacked and bitten by one of the dogs in daycare.  From what they told me, I can only assume she was unattended with the daycare population for at least an hour, and a known aggressive dog did the biting.  They have these issues all the time, which is why they make you sign a book's worth of waivers.  My dog was anxious and upset around other dogs for months after."
Birmingham,3ad364,allt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:55:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. Have you heard anything about the groomer/daycare across from WorkPlay? I can't think of the name.

For daycare and boarding, we've only used Vulcan Park and a place in Hoover called the Pampered Pet Resort.  That place is great if you're going to be out of town for a while.  They are in a quiet spot, indoor/outdoor runs, group play time, and you can send food from home.  The prices are competitive."
Birmingham,3ad364,imnotthesame,2,Fri Jun 19 15:44:12 2015 UTC,You might want to look into We Talk Dog. They have daycare/grooming/boarding and there is someone in the building monitoring the dogs 24/7.
Birmingham,3ad364,Carlajeanwhitley,2,Sat Jun 20 02:41:20 2015 UTC,I take my puppy there!  Just Happy Hounds!  I LOVE them for boarding.  They love the animals and my dog loves going there.  She's really high energy and loves to play all day and that's pretty much what they do there.  They have different temperament groups so timid dogs aren't with the big loud dogs.  They did a tour with me of the facility when I dropped her off for her temperament test and it was really great.  Really great people.

Birmingham,3a90cl,jmwbama311,2,Thu Jun 18 21:35:36 2015 UTC,Collins. Josh and Feizal are amazing bartenders. Their whole staff is excellent.

Birmingham,3a8mjp,herberthunke,4,Thu Jun 18 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"Seasick is a great store! If you are into any current music, they really have their finger on the pulse. Charlemagne is worth a visit, but in my experience it's a lot of digging to try to find a classic."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,Letchworth,2,Thu Jun 18 05:50:26 2015 UTC,Does Seasick Records have any electronic genres of music?  I've nearly broken my wrist searching for any some such in Charlemagne and Renaissance.
Birmingham,3a8mjp,waaaldooooo,2,Thu Jun 18 11:41:41 2015 UTC,"Give Daniel a call. He usually knows everything that is sitting on the shelf. And if not, he would be happy to find it or order it for you."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,Mannheim_Bear,2,Fri Jun 19 22:13:43 2015 UTC,"What kind of electronic genres are you looking for.  I'm sure I have seen a few at Seasick (The new Aphex Twin for example) but there isn't a dedicated section for it, if that is what you mean."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,Letchworth,2,Thu Jun 18 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"Acid Jazz, Chillout, Downtempo, Illbient, Turntablism, and Latin Jazz."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,Mannheim_Bear,4,Thu Jun 18 16:23:25 2015 UTC,"...I'm not sure all of those things you said are actual words.  In seriousness though, I do not know if they do or don't since I am not familiar with those genres.  That being said, it would be worth a trip once to see, and if they don't, you can talk to the owner about getting some in stock"
Birmingham,3a8mjp,Letchworth,2,Thu Jun 18 16:34:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I get those kind of blank stares when I ask about any inorganic music in this city.
Birmingham,3a8mjp,Mannheim_Bear,2,Thu Jun 18 16:39:31 2015 UTC,"I could certainly see that.  I have found in my experience at Seasick that if they don't know of what you are talking about, they will certainly ask so they will know next time."

Birmingham,3a8mjp,awayfromit,2,Thu Jun 18 16:49:34 2015 UTC,They have some stuff in this vain but maybe not what you're looking for. The owner Daniel is really nice and is more than willing to take requests.
Birmingham,3a8mjp,FalconHunter,2,Fri Jun 19 04:06:05 2015 UTC,"It's a shame that Bad Seed is long gone. They used to be the go-to venue in Southside (and Birmingham) for things like that.  These days, most of the new releases are digital and obtained via Beatport."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,FalconHunter,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"...I'm not sure all of those things you said are actual words.   They're all pretty standard, niche (yes, I know) genres of electronic music.   There used to be a couple places that carried that stuff, but the niche crowd in the south is very picky (mostly House, Drum & Bass, Jungle, Breakbeat, and Dubstep/Trap) so trying to find a place that carries it regularly, let alone stocks it when it rarely sells is nearly impossible.   Bad Seed used to be across from Chez Fon Fon and they had an AMAZING selection. Bailey Brothers and Legion tried to fill that void later but both ended up getting out of it because it was more trouble than it was worth and the digital distribution era had begun."

Birmingham,3a8mjp,Athenax311,3,Sun Jun 21 04:09:28 2015 UTC,"I'm also going to put myself in the ""both"" camp. You are supporting the vinyl/small business either way. I went to Seasick for the Banditios show and it made me excited to see bands playing in store. I finally felt a wave of '95-'96 come over me. Sorry that's the nostalgic Magic platter talk from a silly suburban girl."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,kcmcadams,2,Thu Jun 18 07:49:35 2015 UTC,"I tried to make it to that show, grew up with a couple of them and haven't seen them in a while, heard it was great and hate i couldn't make it until after they were finished. But that was my first time in the new seasick and in my opinion it was so much better, the building and the selection of music."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,BlueHerringMambo,3,Fri Jun 19 19:15:03 2015 UTC,"Seriously, do both. Also Renaissance Records... but don't start talking there cause the guy will talk your ear off. Birmingham is small enough that you can do all of them."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,Mannheim_Bear,3,Thu Jun 18 03:55:54 2015 UTC,"Charlemagne is a great place to find used records, with most of their stock running up through the 1980's, though they do carry some new titles as well.  This is where you're going to go to get your classic rock, R&B, Jazz, and soul records.  It also has that great classic record store vibe.  Renaissance was started when a couple of people broke off from Charlamagne to open their own store (though, unless I'm mistaken, the owner of Renaissance is still partial owner of Charlamagne).  It's stock is similar to Charlamage, though smaller and honestly, less organized.  It does have a larger selection of new titles though, and you never know what you mind find in one of their stacks.  Seasick is the new store in town (and just moved to a bigger and easier to find location).  Its focus is largely on new titles, with a large range of Indie rock, Punk Rock, Hip Hop, and Metal.  They do have a used section that has actually grown since they moved to their new spot and once in a while someone will bring in a treasure trove of great used records, but most of their stock is going to be new records and reissues.  Personally, I pretty much only go to Seasick now.  That probably has to do with my age (31) and my musical tastes (90's rock) but all three are great stores and worth checking out if you have the time."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,jcpham,3,Thu Jun 18 16:30:41 2015 UTC,Seasick times 9000!
Birmingham,3a8mjp,Igotbillstopay,3,Thu Jun 18 16:55:54 2015 UTC,"I would hit up Seasick for sure. They recently moved to a bigger location in Crestwood. I'm not really big into vinyl, but I go with my friends and they seem to be really helpful, and have a wide variety of music."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,seasickbham,3,Thu Jun 18 20:12:42 2015 UTC,"You should check out Charlemagne, Renaissance, and us! Like other people have said we are definitely going to have a lot more current artists and new pressings. We have stepped up our used vinyl game significantly since we moved to our new location. I've been putting out new used stuff just about every day. If we don't have what you're looking for ill do my best to find it for you!  Hope to see you at some point! 5508 Crestwood Blvd."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,MisterTito,4,Fri Jun 19 13:53:24 2015 UTC,"Why not both? They're both within 10 minutes of each other. I haven't been in Seasick, so I can't say how it is. If you decide to go to Charlemagne, there is also Renaissance Records literally right down the street. I haven't been there, either. Actually, I haven't been in Charlemagne in years either.   So, I can't really tell you which is the best, but all three are close together and it's doable to hit them all instead of having to pick, depending on how much time you have altogether I guess."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,SouthernMurse,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:12:24 2015 UTC,"I've been to both Renaissance and Charlemagne in the past month. I like them both a lot, but I wound up buying five records from Renaissance and only two from Charlemagne. If that's any kind of tell? I think the stuff I found that I wanted at Charlemagne was more than I was interested in spending on it but the price was a little more fair at renaissance."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,CasioCalculator,2,Thu Jun 18 03:53:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to seasick in a year or so but I'd say it really depends on what your music tastes are. If you're more into small indie labels Seasick is a better bet. If you're looking for say a Beatles record or something along those lines Charlemagne will have you covered. I'm with the other person though, just go to all three."
Birmingham,3a8mjp,xforewarnedx,2,Thu Jun 18 03:31:57 2015 UTC,I enjoy Charlemagne and Renaissance a good bit. Lots of variety with them.
Birmingham,3a87xk,skarulid,2,Thu Jun 18 00:15:44 2015 UTC,Are they not selling those again this year? They had tons of those last year.

Birmingham,3a8nfd,Bomblulu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:19:25 2015 UTC,"I recommend making an appointment at the Bessemer courthouse..   In my experience, the one downtown would grant a license (the $54.50 part) but we had to get a signature from an ordained minister elsewhere. They let a 3rd party post up in their lobby who is offering to do just that, but you can definitely expect strong religious overtones if you go that route. In Bessemer, the actual probate judge marries you directly and signs for $15 extra ($15 + $54.50 I think). Compared to the options downtown she was very efficient, kind, and favorable. We also have a signature we can respect. The judge was in great spirits and even snapped a quick picture by the ""marriage window""."

Birmingham,3a7y7c,prettyhelmet,2,Wed Jun 17 23:05:21 2015 UTC,It's on the festival's site too..
Birmingham,3a7y7c,willco17,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:12:39 2015 UTC,"So there are supposed to be 3 stages. I guess it's safe to assume the top line acts are the headliners on the 3 stages each night?  Edit: Also, they released info for the Nick 'N Friends food/dining thingamajig today. Tickets are $65 for a one-day pass which includes five ""tasting options"" and 2 beverages/cocktails. Still seems pretty vague at this point and overpriced for a one-day ticket. I assume there will be normal festival food vendors on site, I hope."
Birmingham,3a7y7c,MisterTito,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:54:08 2015 UTC,"I would think that the 1 and 3 bands would be on the same stage (Cage the Elephant plays on stage A, then Band of Horses on Stage B, Then Modest Mouse on stage A for example).  Usually there are 2 main stages and a third smaller stage that isn't necessarily used the whole day or is used for some of the off-the-beaten-path sort of bands.  Since this is the first year though, we won't know for sure until the actual schedule comes out."
Birmingham,3a7y7c,Mannheim_Bear,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"65$ for a one day pass isn't so bad if you consider the individual price of a show of each of those bands, esp the big names. Big Gigantic was 25$ or so at Iron City last time they came through. And you get a full day of music + dose. I just imagine Sloss Fest won't be anywhere near as cool as other festis like Wakarusa, Electric Forest, Aura, or Camp Bisco lol"
Birmingham,3a7y7c,brandonsmth,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:44:27 2015 UTC,"The $65 Nick 'N Friends pass is just for some kind of food experience thing, not a pass into the festival. You still need a festival pass, this is like some kind of add-on."

Birmingham,3a70og,wardamntardis,2,Wed Jun 17 20:07:38 2015 UTC,I am willing to stay over. I had a small dog and several cats growing up and pet sat for several of my neighbors and friends with larger dogs. I only burgle on non-holiday weekends. Even miscreants need a rest. I don't currently have any pets of my own because of moving frequently for school and co-oping so I wouldn't mind a weekend of hanging out with some furry buddies.

I've been reading this subreddit since I moved here over 2 years ago, I just don't post much on any form of social media. At the time I offered they didn't really have many responses and it didn't matter to me whether I spend the weekend hanging out at my own apartment or at their place so I figured I'd offer to help out. However they have since gotten many more replies so they might prefer to go with one of those and that would be fine. I imagine that they would get more information through a pm or meet up with whoever they were going to have staying at their house sometime in the next few weeks prior to handing over the keys to a stranger regardless of their posting activity."

I'd be more comfortable with visiting them 3x a day, which is once more than I usually visit the cats, so I wouldn't say no to some dollars, but it would be pretty reasonable.

Unfortunately they still face a steep uphill climb, the beer distributors in the state vehemently oppose any kind of self distribution or take away sales that bypass the distributors themselves.  Making matters worse, those distributors have been around a long time and many are deeply politically connected.  I can't say I blame them for fighting for their business, but I think we'd be better off economically if direct sales were allowed."
Birmingham,3a5t4d,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Wed Jun 17 14:10:56 2015 UTC,I totally blame them. Using the law to kill off competition is corrupt and unethical.
Birmingham,3a5t4d,DT777,2,Fri Jun 19 17:24:29 2015 UTC,"Sure it is!  But I think the blame resides more with the state officials that allow it than the people that exploit it.  This may sound cynical, but I've come to expect companies to try this kind of shit to succeed while at the same time I'm incredibly disappointed in and angry at the officials that allow it.  Companies exist to maximize profits, elected officials should exist to curtail them from doing damage, not enable them to do more."

They pay you minimum wage plus commission. They will tell you all about how much money you can make too. Thankfully I got a much better job after Coast to Coast.

Birmingham,3a14d9,Carlajeanwhitley,2,Tue Jun 16 13:04:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendation ! Is it relatively quiet there? I like it to be quiet or a steady hum. Hard to stay focused when loud conversations are going on around me...
Birmingham,3a14d9,Carlajeanwhitley,2,Tue Jun 16 13:57:51 2015 UTC,"It varies. I do NOT recommend it right after Mountain Brook school drop off, because many of the moms come in and chat. (Which is lovely! But not good for a distraction-free environment.) Same with right after school lets out. But evenings and random mid-day visits are typically pretty quiet. They also have an upstairs that is basically always quiet, but the best chairs are in the picture window downstairs."

Birmingham,39yio2,datraceman,3,Wed Jun 17 19:29:17 2015 UTC,"Here is a list of comic/board game/wargame stores I know of in the metro area  Kingdom Comics (Park South Shopping Center, Vestavia Hills) - Their specialty is comics and collectibles. These guys are probably the most knowledgable about comics in the city. The also carry CCGs and Heroclix. Stan, Jason, and Albert are good people.  Excelsior (Lorna Road, Hoover) - This is an all-around geek store. They carry comics, CCGs, wargaming, rpgs, board games, and accessories. They also offer a loyalty program ($10 store credit upon collecting 10 initials for every $10 of your purchase).  Games Workshop Store (Riverchase Promenade, Hoover) - Games Workshop stuff. Never been to the store, but it exists.  The Keep (Hwy 119, Alabaster) - Opened pretty recently. I haven't had the chance to go. I know they host RPG, board game, and CCG events. Several people I know attend functions there. http://www.thekeepshop.com/  Legion (Cahaba Heights Rd, Cahaba Heights) - This is another catch-all store. I haven't been in years for personal reasons, but they used to have the best RPG selection in town.  Bud's Place (Leeds) - Been out there once to see it a couple of years ago. Nice little store geared toward CCG and wargaming. They did some RPG and board game stuff too. http://www.budsplacegames.com/  Edit:  CJ Cards and Games (Valleydale/Caldwell Mill Intersection) - Never been here, but looks like an active store for CCG specifically."

Birmingham,39yio2,mixduptransistor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:13:51 2015 UTC,"A few additions to the notes:  Kingdom Comics (Park South Shopping Center, Vestavia Hills) - Comics and more comics with some comics. A few odds and ends here and there but most of the collectibles are very old or they've just arrived.  Excelsior (Lorna Road, Hoover) - Pretty good ideal of what you want a game/comic store to be. Good hours, good location, competitive prices, and a very friendly and charismatic owner with years of experience. Pretty much a catch-all with no specific focus. If Ken doesn't have it, he may be able to get it for you. Beware the Magic players - many of the more irritating ones in the area have set up shop at this venue. Not Ken's fault, but they can be incredibly irritating to endure.   Games Workshop Store (Riverchase Promenade, Hoover) - Retail and promotion store. Can't manage to keep a manager. They're pretty much just there for show and sales. I've been told by numerous sources that casual play in the store is discouraged by upper management (company/district/etc.) If you need the product and MSRP, this place probably has it....if you play Warhammer 40K/Fantasy  The Keep (Hwy 119, Alabaster) - I know nothing about this place but it's remote so that could impact their revenue and visibility.  Legion (Cahaba Heights Rd, Cahaba Heights) - One of the longest operating stores in the area - owner claims over 20 years and I can confirm at least 17. The store is not shopper friendly - something I attempted to assist the owner with TWICE and have been on his ass about for over a decade. Due to the volume of merchandise (new and old) and the limited labor he employs (he pays very poorly) things get out of control VERY quickly. Owner is also very moody, arrogant, and chatty (sometimes a bit invasive.) However, if you're looking for something - he's very likely to have it no matter what your niche/hobby. Anime, Manga, Comics, Graphic Novels/Trade paperbacks, gaming supplies, games, toys, Magic cards (singles and packs), collectible card games of most shapes and sizes, statues, and tons and tons more.   Paul needs lots and lots more space than he has but he's perpetually plagued by issues that prevent him from relocating. The venue is divided into two ""stores."" The right-most store is the original (once called Empire) and houses most of the comics, statues, figures, cards, back issues, and odds n ends. The left store is the ""gaming"" store and houses most of the board games and miniatures gaming supplies as well as the manga and anime (and related items). They used to have a large gaming area but it's become cluttered due to poor upkeep. They have a giant amount of customer-created and donated terrain for your miniatures games. They have multiple board games donated by a very benevolent regular patron so that browsers can try them out or just play a pick up game.   Of additional note: the bathrooms are rarely spotless and the HVAC is controlled with an iron grip. It's often very warm in the summer and freezing in the winter.   Bud's Place (Leeds) - Decent catch-all but remote and the owner doesn't do more than put in face time. This is good because he's the likable one. The son operates the venue and he's terribly unpleasant to interact with. They have a decent selection of stuff for gaming.  CJ Cards and Games (Valleydale/Caldwell Mill Intersection) - Mostly CCG and a little bit of tabletop miniatures. Been open for several years, was the second of two stores (the first being a former sports card shop in Vestavia that got into Magic and boomed.) Owner has grown fatigued and is trying to sell the business (if he didn't already) and consolidated operations to just the Valleydale store. They sell current CCG products and accessories, some basic board games and a limited selection of miniatures gaming supplies along with a place to play."

On their Facebook page they said they didn't want to spend what it would take to ""take Mad Doctor to the next level"" but I don't know what that means. It seemed like they were just tired of being mediocre, and doing anything different probably would've meant a new location or renovations or otherwise spending a lot of money without any guarantee of return.

People would fuss at me for not calling them back and I wouldn't even have a notification that they had called. I have T mobile now and it costs less and I have no problems with service. The only thing to keep in mind is that their coverage is great in cities but you will have no service in between if you travel. For example I don't have service for a while between here and Atlanta, then it picks back up, then I lose it again until I get to Greenville. Also lose it between here and Montgomery. But here in town where I spend 95% of my time I don't have any trouble. If you jail break your phone you can get unlimited hotspot too."

I'd definitely take the time to read all of it because it will clarify some urban myths about renter rights. You cannot pay for a repair and take it off your rent. You can request in writing (with receipt of delivery) for a repair. There are ways to legally break lease, but you will need to have followed all the right procedures and, I stress this, have everything in writing. Everything."
Birmingham,39qhus,uncannythom,3,Sat Jun 13 21:17:25 2015 UTC,That point about having everything in writing is why I've made it a habit of making maintenance requests via email with my landlord instead of phone calls.
Birmingham,39qhus,MisterTito,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:48:00 2015 UTC,Very good advice!
Birmingham,39qhus,jessirentmonster,3,Sun Jun 14 21:40:45 2015 UTC,"I just went through the same thing this week. Made a request on Monday and it took until Thursday to get someone out here. On the upside, when they did come out they replaced both window units with brand new, digitally controlled energy efficient units. If you live in the Southside/Highland area then I wouldn't be surprised if you're dealing with the same property managers that I have.   As the week crept on, I found out pretty much the same thing as that handbook /u/uncannythom linked. Your only remedy seems to be to give your landlord 14 day notice to make the repair or you will terminate the lease. Kind of a shitty remedy in my opinion since you're putting yourself in the situation of suddenly having to find a new place to live. But, it is what it is I guess."
Birmingham,39qhus,MisterTito,2,Sat Jun 13 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"When I rented my first apartment, I had a similar situation with the heat during a cold winter.  I was furious.  It seemed unjust that I was still required to pay rent when the property wasn't in the condition that I agreed to rent it in.  I investigated, and found that renters don't have a lot of rights here, at least not in that common sense way you'd expect in this situation. I huffed, puffed, and shivered for a bit until the problem was resolved.  But still, fuck that landlord.   Two decades later, I'm a landlord. And I've discovered that it cuts both ways.  In ways, landlords don't have a ton of rights in that common sense way you'd expect either.  I've had to wait 60 days to evict a tenant who clearly wasn't paying, and had to pay several hundred dollars in legal fees to do so once that time had passed.   As a landlord, I left someone like you without air conditioning over a weekend, too.  And not just any weekend--a holiday weekend in the blistering heat of summer.  It was Labor Day or July 4th, I can't remember, but it was unbearable.  Someone had broken into the basement and stolen probably $2 worth of copper line from the HVAC.  The result was that it burned up the exterior unit and severely screwed the interior unit as well.  Cost me about 4 month's rent to fix.  And it happened on a Friday of a holiday weekend.  Best time anyone would give me to replace it was the next Tuesday, I think.  I felt so bad for my tenant, but there was nothing I could do about it.  It's not like I'm sitting around with a lot full of HVAC units.  I depend on other people to fix things for me just like my tenant is depending on me to fix things for them.  Sometimes that's super fast and other times it's just not and there's nothing anyone can do about it.   Anyway, my tenant stuck it out and I'm grateful for that.  There are shitty, horrible people in the world, I'll give you as much.  But as I get older, I learn more and more that at every step it's just people doing the best they can to get by.  I guess just consider that it might be that in this case, even though it does seem unjust from your perspective."

Birmingham,39qhus,jessirentmonster,3,Sun Jun 14 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"If the landlord is ok with this, then do what you want, but I'd highly recommend NOT taking repairs out of rent. The landlord will have a case against you if you decide to play with your lease because of what you decide is ""fair."" Seek legal help and pay your rent, the full amount, on time. I'm telling you. This is a common mistake and will hurt you if you go to court about it."

Birmingham,39pjsz,southsam,12,Sat Jun 13 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"I was a passenger and driver for Uber in Houston. It's the best thing that came to the city. The taxi drivers were in an uproar because they are required to pay a city tax for operating.  Uber found loopholes by calling it ""ride sharing"" that allows them to bypass these taxes. So not only does it piss the cab companies off to the point where they try to ban it, Uber also doesn't have to pay the city tax.  Honestly, state and city taxes here are ridiculous. Liquor taxes. All of it is completely outrageous. I've never been in a state that nickels and dimes their citizens while law makers are exempt.  I think they would find a much better Birmingham if Uber was allowed here. It's a simple, more technological than the outdated cab systems. It's fast, usually no more than 5 or 10mim for a ride and the cars are nicer. Not to mention the rating system weeds out the shitty drivers and shitty passengers."
Birmingham,39pjsz,Philobus,7,Sat Jun 13 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. The possibilities didn't open up to me until I actually used it in Nashville. The efficiency was staggering. We went to multiple locations around the city to spend money because we knew we could have a ride in under 5 minutes.   The barrier of not going across town because of this or that will be lowered immensely.   And while all my yellow cab experiences have been pleasant, they simply took too long to get there. More than an hour."
Birmingham,39pjsz,burmp,2,Sat Jun 13 17:05:54 2015 UTC,while all my yellow cab experiences have been pleasant   Lucky you. I've had one non-negative experience with yellow cab in the past 2 years. Way too many times I've had to direct the driver to my house from downtown (i live two turns off the oxmoor/65 exit) or have to hold my own when they claim their credit card machine isn't working.  And all of that is not even bringing into the discussion the insane pricing and wait times.
Birmingham,39pjsz,artcarden,3,Sat Jun 13 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"The wall comes tumbling down. I took UberX everywhere in Charleston a few months ago, and I've also used it in Atlanta, San Antonio, and New York (and Lyft) in Phoenix. I don't see how anyone could take UberX and think it is somehow more dangerous and less reliable than a taxi. Last summer, when I downloaded the Yellow Cab Birmingham app, I searched for ""airport"" and iirc the first result was a hotel at Laguardia.  This isn't about substitutes for cabs, it's about a change in how we live, work, and play: if Birmingham had ride-sharing, I would hardly ever drive and may not even own a car."
Birmingham,39pjsz,cmcooper2,2,Sat Jun 13 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you exactly what happened with Birmingham's Uber. This is somewhat kept under wraps except for the people within government (not me) but I have a reliable source. The danger/reliability was an ""issue"" but when the taxi lobbyist came to Birmingham, it was over from the tip-off. Progression is not possible in the presence of corruption imo, and Birmingham has A LOT of corruption."

Birmingham,39pjsz,mixduptransistor,3,Sat Jun 13 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, being linked directly to a driver who's minutes away, who you can then track on gps until they get to you is pretty much the same as calling a dispatcher and being told 30 minutes and then having a driver show up even later if ever."
Birmingham,39pjsz,Everwinter81,0,Sun Jun 14 01:34:47 2015 UTC,"As a matter of fact, it is. It's just that Uber is better operationally than Yellow Cab. It doesn't change the underlying fact of what service you're buying.  Walmart is better operationally than Sears or K-Mart. That doesn't mean that Walmart isn't in the same business as them. Or, it doesn't mean that when you order a pizza online all of a sudden Pizza Hut isn't in the pizza delivery business."
Birmingham,39pjsz,Everwinter81,2,Sun Jun 14 03:39:53 2015 UTC,Which is why Kmart is bankrupt and Wal mart employs more Americans than any other company.

Birmingham,39pjsz,mixduptransistor,0,Sun Jun 14 10:19:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that is not the point. The point is that they are both in the same industry. Uber is in the transportation industry, not the ""tech"" industry. They haven't come up with some magical new technology. They simply applied the internet to a boring old service just like Papa Johns. They may have better service than yellow cab, but they are still a cab company at the core."
Birmingham,39pjsz,sabansaban,2,Sun Jun 14 14:26:18 2015 UTC,They have a superior delivery and a superior product. Their cars are newer and cleaner and their drivers nicer. As a whole.
Birmingham,39pjsz,mixduptransistor,0,Mon Jun 15 00:06:28 2015 UTC,"Where did I say that they didn't? My point is that, even though they have a superior service they are still a transportation company as much as Yellow Cab."
Birmingham,39pjsz,Philobus,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"Tried yellow cab Saturday night.  Call placed about 7:00, driver called me at 9:45 saying he was on the way.  I hung up.

Birmingham,39pjsz,mixduptransistor,-3,Mon Jun 15 14:13:57 2015 UTC,"Well, it looks like Uber actually got involved in the process up front in these cities. I've been pretty anti-Uber, but I read the summary of Huntsville's new regulations and I would be in favor of those regulations coming to Birmingham."
Birmingham,39pjsz,burmp,2,Sat Jun 13 16:54:02 2015 UTC,May I ask why you were anti-Uber?
Birmingham,39pjsz,mixduptransistor,-3,Sat Jun 13 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Because they don't want to pay their way (they want to be exempt from taxes and license fees), they shift liability to their employees (which they call ""contractors"" to try to get out from under them) and they essentially wanted to have free reign with no oversight at all."
Birmingham,39pjsz,burmp,8,Sat Jun 13 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"You do realize YellowCab refers to its drivers as ""independent contractors"" to (unsuccessfully) try to absolve itself from legal liability whenever the cab driver gets into an accident?  All it takes to be a driver for YellowCab is a taxi license from Bham (that the drivers have to get on their own), the most minimum of all other requirements (it's ok to have a DUI or be a felon as long as it's not within the past 5 years), and ~80 dollars a day to rent the cab.  Requirements from their website."
Birmingham,39pjsz,mixduptransistor,-3,Sat Jun 13 18:34:38 2015 UTC,So why does Uber magically get to not have taxi licenses for their drivers?
Birmingham,39pjsz,burmp,4,Sat Jun 13 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"Oh. The taxi license where the only requirement is a regular drivers license and a normal business license. There is no heightened license (i.e. don't need a commercial license) requirement for a taxi license, only paperwork and fees paid to the city to operate as a business."
Birmingham,39pjsz,mixduptransistor,-2,Sat Jun 13 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"Right, and Uber didn't want to get nor did they want their drivers to have to get, a normal business license.  They wanted zero licensure, period."
Birmingham,39pjsz,burmp,3,Sat Jun 13 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"And if Uber is going to operate as a business, they should have to apply as a business, whether it be as an in-state corporation or a foreign corporation doing business in AL. That being said, the ""taxi license"" requirement is idiotic. If they have a regular driver's license and are an employee (or ""contractor"") for said business that has a business license, that's all that should be necessary. Taxi license is nothing more than red tape and attempts to grab more money by the local gov."
Birmingham,39pjsz,NJWhiskeyHunter,-2,Sat Jun 13 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"attempts to grab more money by the local gov.   Well, one could say that about all taxes and licenses, even ""basic"" business licenses.  And FWIW, government doesn't get to make up it's own money. Services have to be paid for somehow."
Birmingham,39pjsz,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Sat Jun 13 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"Which is understandable for most businesses (i.e. retail stores/restaurants/factories) where they have a primary address that has to be registered for filings and for business specific regulations.   The only Alabama regulations for cabs themselves are that (quoting from an al.com article): ""They must be clean, safe and have four doors. Inside the cab, smoking is illegal, music must not be played, the heating and air conditioning must work properly and drivers are supposed to wear collared shirts.""  I've taken more than enough cabs in Birmingham that met literally zero of those requirements. There's no agency that enforces the regulations or anything else that fees normally go to.  I've yet to have a single bad experience with uber whether it be in Atl, Memphis, or DC. Not to mention the fact there is no feedback system for YellowCab since they essentially have a monopoly in the city. Uber allows for both customer feedback (drivers rated under a certain score are no longer allowed to drive) and driver feedback (customers rated under a certain score won't get picked up)."
Birmingham,39pjsz,mixduptransistor,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:01:39 2015 UTC,Wrong
Birmingham,39pjsz,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Mon Jun 15 13:10:36 2015 UTC,"And again, you are so fucking wrong.  Uber accepts sensible regulation.  Instead of actually working with them, Rafferty hired a consultant with cab ties, drafted new regs that shot uber in the leg, rammed it through council, and then bragged about it in her leaked emails."
Birmingham,39pjsz,mixduptransistor,0,Mon Jun 15 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"How did they ""shoot uber in the leg""?  Requiring them to have insurance? Requiring them to have a fucking business permit that even the lady selling hotdogs on the corner has to buy?"
Birmingham,39pjsz,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Mon Jun 15 14:00:17 2015 UTC,So much more than that.  Read the transportation code and get back to me when you are informed enough to actually discuss it.
Birmingham,39pjsz,mixduptransistor,0,Mon Jun 15 14:01:51 2015 UTC,"I've read it, but how does that tell me what Uber has a problem with? Why can't anyone tell me what Uber's problem with the regulation is? They won't even say publicly."
Birmingham,39pjsz,cmcooper2,2,Mon Jun 15 14:07:46 2015 UTC,"Uber HAS insurance that far exceeds what the city actually requires.  They want each driver to have a business license, which is insane.  They want the same inspection regimens (which make sense for a 25year old POS, but not for a newer car).  This whole ""Uber insists on being unregulated"" line is simply wrong.  One look at the deals they have struck with other cities would show you that they work with cities to craft regulations that make sense for both parties.  But, the anti-rideshare crowd doesn't seem to care, they just keep parroting this same lie over and over again.     As for Birmingham, they never even gave it a shot.  Rafferty's leaked emails make it pretty clear her priority was killing it before it even had a chance.  The rewritten transportation code just says ""rideshares are taxis"", without looking at WHY our taxis suck. Here's a hint:  We overregulate to the point that only a few small companies can make it work, and they only make it work by having FAR fewer cabs than the city needs so that the ones they do have are running at capacity all the time.  They don't give a shit about your 2 hour wait, since you have zero other options."

Birmingham,39qoes,Gabby90,2,Sun Jun 14 23:09:52 2015 UTC,"Not PacerFan, but I just help friends move out of Village at Lakeshore. It was a beautiful space, but it definitely wasn't worth what they were paying ($1145 for a 2/2). The new property management company gave them fits and I can honestly say we called up there several times to get a fax number and no one answered or returned our calls   My personal impression of apartments out on Lakeshore: cookie cutter new(er) construction. However, they do boast a lot of amenities that you aren't prone to finding downtown, like pools, gyms, and tennis courts. Again, personal experience here, but commuter traffic from Homewood can be rough, especially if you are hitting at rush hour."
Birmingham,39qoes,LaUnika,2,Mon Jun 15 00:42:04 2015 UTC,"Yeahh I know a few people that live on Lakshore and they're all generally happy. Just try your best to avoid i65 from 4:30-5:30pm on weekdays, it's horrible. Agreed with the poster above, you gotta deal with rush hour and it's expensive for how far away from downtown it is.

That was the first fight that he didn't knock out his opponent in pro boxing.  Sure he sandbagged a little bit, but that was more of him getting used to professional boxing.  His record seems slightly skewed, but he's still at the top."
Birmingham,39mfle,Everwinter81,4,Fri Jun 12 21:00:47 2015 UTC,Saw his interview live on ESPN after the weigh in. They asked him why he didn't do it in Tuscaloosa. He said he thought Tuscaloosa had gotten too high on themselves bc of everything the football team has done and it started with the school president. He didn't... Bear with me..... Pull any punches.   He said Birmingham called him back in 15 minutes and said come on. I'm really proud of how the city handled the wilder fight and all the associated logistics.

Birmingham,39hnot,Sweetteathree,-1,Fri Jun 12 19:12:15 2015 UTC,I think that has more to do with cultural overeating than their sex.   So does this mean that they don't have good portion control at Chipotle?

Birmingham,39j2nt,oneeasypod,3,Fri Jun 12 01:55:43 2015 UTC,"It's an awesome game, doesn't get repetitive or boring, looks/sounds amazing, great story.  I only have one complaint....  Roach is an idiot."
Birmingham,39j2nt,64voxac30,2,Fri Jun 12 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"That game is absolutely massive! No where near close in my PC build to play the PC version, but slogging through it on the PS4.    That game really has set the bar for modern games."
Birmingham,39j2nt,oneeasypod,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:58:24 2015 UTC,It scales pretty well too. I have a q9650 cpu in an old Dell Xps 420 that I've been patching together for years. I can run everything on at 1080p. It makes me sad how much the console market holds back what could have been. My computer is 10 years old this year and thought W3 was going to be the reason to upgrade.   I blame microsoft. Instead of building a decent living room media gaming machine OS  into windows. They tried to cram it into Xbox and lost billions of dollars. I guess the lure of proprietary music and movie stores is too glittering...
Birmingham,39j2nt,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:05:16 2015 UTC,"I am torn on how I feel about SteamOS. On one hand, it is getting PC gaming into the living room, on the other hand being a Linux disto, there isn't as much support as Windows."
Birmingham,39j2nt,oneeasypod,3,Fri Jun 12 02:23:57 2015 UTC,"I am a Linux user and have been for over a decade. Linux is 1000x easier than it used to be. 1000x more secure than Windows. 100x less annoying than Windows such as no annoying updates you can't skip, no bullshit malware infested installers, no bloatware and so on.  Gaming is the only thing that Linux doesn't win on hands down. That is changing thanks to Valve.  I mean this comment thread is about Witcher 3 which works on Linux natively and had better performance on Linux. All Borderlands games are on Linux, Batman Arkum Knight will be on Linux day of release.  The idea that Linux isn't for gaming is dying fast because Valve saw the potential for Linux and has capitalized on it."
Birmingham,39j2nt,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:36:29 2015 UTC,Are you allowed to build your own. It might being an apealing dual booter for kids and families.
Birmingham,39j2nt,MichaelTunnell,2,Fri Jun 12 02:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, thanks to it being based on Linux means that you can build your own machine and install SteamOS on it. You don't even have to wait, you can do that right now.  Or you can just install any Linux distro you want on a machine, install SteamOS and then you have a full Linux machine that can also so everything that SteamOS can.  Valve is basically doing everything right for average consumers and the enthusiasts alike.   source: Linux user for over a decade, even when Steam was a pipe dream for us."
Birmingham,39j2nt,bhamroadrunner,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:40:53 2015 UTC,You know just about everything I know LOL! It might work out being the same cost as running a bare bones Windows PC with Big Picture Steam.
Birmingham,39j2nt,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:56:03 2015 UTC,"You would still save money using Linux and SteamOS because the machine can even be more bare bones and run fantastically on Linux.  Linux only needs 1/10th resources that Windows demands so you can use all of the rest of the resources towards the game.  Minimum 64bit Windows = 2GB - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/system-requirements  Linux can go as low as 50 mb, that would be absurdly limited but it can.   A more reasonable minimum is 512mb but you would have a great experience with Linux under the MATE desktop environment at 2 GB. So the minimum for Windows to have an awful experience is enough to have a good experience then the more and more you add the more awesome Linux performs."
Birmingham,39j2nt,bhamroadrunner,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:42:52 2015 UTC,I enjoy the steam client on my Ubuntu box. Unfortunately I've relegated it to HTPC duties now due to a lack of graphics processing. I play the shit out of KSP though. I may look into getting Wine to run WoW for my next gaming box.
Birmingham,39j2nt,MichaelTunnell,2,Fri Jun 12 11:48:08 2015 UTC,Linux has great graphics processing although much better on NVIDIA than AMD because NVIDIA actually cares about the Linux community. I pretty much despise AMD because of their practical abandonment of Linux.
Birmingham,39j2nt,ditchell,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:25:16 2015 UTC,Duly noted. I was almost going with an AMD processor on the next box.

Birmingham,39j2nt,JDH1234,2,Fri Jun 12 03:22:30 2015 UTC,I dont get MMOs and I dont get repetitive online shooters. I need a story and I need it to have an end
Birmingham,39j2nt,Bmoe79,4,Fri Jun 12 03:59:40 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Story > competition. I don't give a shit what my k/d is, I am playing to live a story. I just wish there were more multiplayer story games. Borderlands is fun, but I just don't know of many more."

Birmingham,39j2nt,Bmoe79,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:54:38 2015 UTC,Or Mumble instead of Teamspeak since Mumble is Open Source and Libre Software. :-)  But really though local gaming group would be cool . . . I think there is one on meetup.com but don't remember.
Birmingham,39j2nt,BluCrayons,4,Fri Jun 12 07:01:31 2015 UTC,Meetups or LAN's could be cool but I do not feel like lugging around this desktop. Would much prefer to just have a Mumble call with lobbies for different games and stuff.

Discounts on new games? I feel like I've missed out so much only using consoles!  Plus if you haven't heard of it, Humble Bundle is also having a sale of some great Indy games. http://humblebundle.com"
Birmingham,39j2nt,tkeiy714,3,Fri Jun 12 03:53:50 2015 UTC,"Upvotes for humble bundle, they even have a humble book bundle regularly on their site."

Birmingham,39j2nt,tkeiy714,2,Fri Jun 12 06:53:12 2015 UTC,"I've been hearing a lot about the Humble Bundles. I have to admit I have always been a heavy console player, up until maybe a month ago. I have just gotten to the point where $60 for a new title for my ps4 is just psychotic. I mean for $25, I can get the entire Valve collection with hundreds of hours of content! Even new AAA games can be found with major discounts and lower prices.   That is before even getting into the quality difference. I still will always own a new console, just for the sake of simplicity and convenience."

Birmingham,39j2nt,BluCrayons,2,Fri Jun 12 06:55:13 2015 UTC,"I play on whatever is holding my attention at the time...console or PC.  Right now it just happens to be PC, but mostly just WoW at the moment."
Birmingham,39j2nt,MichaelTunnell,2,Fri Jun 12 13:00:37 2015 UTC,"I'm the same.  I bought a ton of games with the last Steam Summer Sale, and I think I've played about 2 of them.  WoW will always be my fall back."
Birmingham,39j2nt,fetalbeej,2,Fri Jun 12 13:41:54 2015 UTC,I play far too much WoW and Hearthstone.  Good to see we have this many PCMR in the ham!
Birmingham,39j2nt,fetalbeej,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:38:11 2015 UTC,"I think Hearthstone is fun, but only played it for a few weeks and then again later to unlock the mount for WoW.  I'll be doing the same for Heroes.  Probably just play it enough to get the pet."
Birmingham,39j2nt,its_john_k,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:04:49 2015 UTC,Hearthstone is fun for now. But I can't believe how pay dependent it is.
Birmingham,39j2nt,Chrismont,2,Sun Jun 14 16:08:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I heard you can't even buy the expansions for just gold anymore.  I've been playing since 3 months after release but it isn't very new player friendly when mandatory cards come from expansions that cost money.  If you really like the game though they are worth the money.
Birmingham,39j2nt,Bmoe79,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:13:47 2015 UTC,You can it just takes a lot. 700 per wing and there's 5 wings in an expansion. or $6 for a wing. To me that just seems ridiculous. And it takes a good week to stockpile all that gold. It's incredibly frustrating. Hey at least it's fun.
Birmingham,39j2nt,Ben4bama,2,Sun Jun 14 21:21:13 2015 UTC,I'm pretty broke right now so I think I'll just end up getting Call of Juarez and Quake 2 and maybe some puzzle game. I'm hoping Strife gets a daily deal sale too.   I'd love to get Wolfenstein TNO but 1. i never expected it to get this cheap this soon in the first place 2. $15 is like my entire steam sale budget i'm allowing myself (lmao) 3. i don't think my computer would even be able to run it 4. f i f t y gigabytes   Mostly I'm interested in older shooters and catching up on the more recent ones. Apparently I already missed Metro 2033 (didn't realize it was the daily deal) and I might get Bulletstorm. I'm also keeping an eye on Rise of Nations and Medieval II Total War.

Birmingham,39gqn5,all_are_throw_away,-1,Thu Jun 11 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"No need for a teaching degree. The aptitude test (I can't remember what it is called) is required. It is depressingly simple - can you read and add type of questions.  You should apply to teach your major, but if that isn't a good idea, you could show mastery of a skill in some other way.  The paperwork might be really tedious. But it's worth a shot! Good Luck!"
Birmingham,39gqn5,mrslacroix,6,Thu Jun 11 19:43:56 2015 UTC,Still have to be licensed. Requires taking the praxis in the field you wish to teach. Along with Saturday classes at a college or a summer term on classroom management.
Birmingham,39gqn5,oneeasypod,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:49:51 2015 UTC,"That is not surprising. I wasn't sure if the Praxis was required. I took it and had a masters in my field before teaching with BCS. Yet, there were plenty of teachers who had just graduated from college and were not with a program such as Americorps. My first year there I was not certified. Every year I taught there, many teachers were hired on an 'emergency' basis which meant there was no time to certify. We all signed something saying that we intended to get certified, but not all of the teachers stayed more than a year.   So, BCS would be a commitment, but it would be a really interesting year."

Birmingham,39b33g,Sweetteathree,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:49:07 2015 UTC,My friend is renting their 3 bed 2 bath home on greensprings. It's a huge house with a bonus room. It's available in August or sooner. They haven't had anyone interested. I think rent is $1200 or $1100. It includes a washer and dryer and fenced in backyard with doggy door

Birmingham,3990cf,homsar47,19,Wed Jun 10 03:07:44 2015 UTC,"Have you thought about going to a Baron's game?   Regions field is extremely nice and tickets to a game are under 15 dollars each last time I checked. In Birmingham, there's sadly not too much for someone under 21 to do besides eat out and go to the movies."
Birmingham,3990cf,BamaCoder,11,Wed Jun 10 03:16:04 2015 UTC,"Barons games, yeah, they're pretty fun. More fun with alcohol, but what isn't.  There's also Airwalk off 280. It's like a gym sized space but everything is trampolines. They have a foam pit, a dodgeball room (with trampoline walls) and basketball goals. Pretty fun. You'll be the oldest ones there if you're out of high school, but whatever. No shame.  First Ave Rocks is pretty fun if you're into that stuff. They're pretty big on Groupon, but may still be a bit more expensive than you'd like. I love going there but am the definition of a skinny fat, so they're usually short trips.  You can go visit Oak Mountain State Park for pretty cheap. They have grills all over, which is great for picnicking. There's also hiking and biking trails, a petting zoo, boat rentals, and wakeboarding (kind of).   Pepper Place Market can be a pretty cute date if you get there early enough. It gets frustrating after a little while because of the crowds, but there are lots of cute dogs and tasty samples.   Railroad Park is always nice for picnics and throwing a frisbee around. Avondale Park is getting better, too, and is within walking distance of Saw's, Post Office Pies, Melt, Wasabi Juans, etc.  Sorry for not very many Hoover suggestions! I really just know the downtown area. Hopefully a Hoover-ite can fill you in on that area. :)"

Birmingham,3990cf,czntix05,6,Wed Jun 10 11:47:27 2015 UTC,"Picnic at Railroad Park, Aldridge Gardens, or the Botanical Gardens.   Dinner at Taste of Thailand and a dollar movie.  Birmingham Museum of Art.  Art Crawl downtown.  Buy stuff for an amazing home cooked brunch at Pepper Place farmer's market.  Selfie tour of all the vistas overlooking downtown.  Be a kid again at the McWane Center.  Hike at Ruffner Mountain or Moss Rock Preserve.  Drive in movie at Argo or Harpersville. One is $5/car on Sunday nights (can't remember which and too lazy to google it).  Top off a food court dinner at Galleria Mall with an Orange Julius and a carousel ride."

Events or markets at trim tab or good people. Free friday flicks in homewood for outdoor movies. Pita stop and Nabeels are really reasonable for food. Das house does cute stuff like weiner dog parades often. Barons games. Going up in Vulcan. If you like hiking red mtn park is awesome. There are old mine shafts, beautiful woods and tree houses that over look the city at the top of the mountain. Its not cheap but you can zip line down the mountain for 40 bucks. Check out bham 365 for free festivals."

They occasionally have live music on Fridays I think.   Moonlight on the Mountain is across the street. It's a listening room that features a lot of touring (mostly folk) musicians. It's byo food and drink.

Or bring your own.   Long boarding lesson at oak mtn courtesy of Alabama outdoors I think. This Saturday 10-2 according to a coworker.   Buy cheap kites and fly them at railroad park.   Chace lake is a nice Hoover neighborhood with a park. Walking distance to food (tazikis, pie 5, etc).   Moss rock is the best. Wear shorts and wade in the water."

Bring water with you if going on a walk in summer, or a snack if going on a walk in winter.  5)  Parents.  I like to read, vidya, or garden in my spare time."

Birmingham,399eqx,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Wed Jun 10 15:41:46 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the 'ham!  I hope you find it as generally welcoming and friendly as I do.   REV is an economic development organization, and they have a LOT of projects going on in various areas.  Lately REV folks have been busy getting our bike share program off the ground, look for the stations and bikes to pop up all over the city soon! There are 5 primary entertainment areas where you'll find the folks you are looking for.  Uptown (by the civic center), Five Points (kinda shady sometimes, but good eats / bars), Lakeview, Avondale (especially 41st st by the Avondale Brewery) and the Loft District (2nd Ave N. between 20th st and 25th st N). Birmingham isn't particularly bike friendly, unfortunately.  But that is changing!  Our bike share is coming, and the state just passed a new law to help with bike safety (minimum passing margin, etc).  Riding on the downtown grid is generally safe though.  There are also some great group rides, check out Le Tour de Ham and the Redemptive Trample. Birmingham has a lot of stuff to do, but it exists in little niches.  Get to know the people in those niches and you'll make fast friends. My wife and I moved back to be closer to our family, and because we missed the warm weather and low cost of living.  It just happened that we moved back right about the time that Birmingham was revitalizing downtown.  Don't regret it one bit.  It's a beautiful city.  Not without its problems, but there is an energy and optimism today that I haven't seen in any of the times I've lived here in the past."
Birmingham,399eqx,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Wed Jun 10 14:11:26 2015 UTC,Sounds great! I think i may have seen a group ride yesterday near Highland park.

Birmingham,399eqx,oneeasypod,3,Wed Jun 10 18:27:35 2015 UTC,Welcome to the neighborhood!  A lot of Crestwood folks are on the sub so it's a good way to meet folks.  I will also recommend you join us on the nextdoor app as Crestwood has a very active community on there that can keep you informed of events and activities.   Music is a huge scene here as is outdoor activities.  If you like to bike check out redemptive cycles for their weekly group rides around the city.  Biking isn't the safest proposition in the area but you can mostly avoid traffic by using second ave south to go downtown/southside  I would highly recommend hanging out at crestwood coffee a few afternoons as many folks in the hood without kids spend the evening hanging out there having a drink.  Add in the sweet record store just opening up next door to it and It can be a relaxing evening way to meet people.   I'm in crestwood as well and while I'm mid 30s with kids so bars etc aren't my thing much anymore I do meet up with neighborhood folks on occasion for some board gaming at the coffee shop.  I would be happy to invite you next time if that interests you at all.

I just prefer the taste of Avondale's offerings much more, like their Spring Street Saison and Peach Saison."
Birmingham,398otr,bhamtown,3,Wed Jun 10 13:41:28 2015 UTC,"The Peach Saison is the main reason I GO to the taproom - it's impossible to find anywhere else and it's really the only beer of theirs that I actively seek out.  That being said, if they ever ceased production of the Peach Saison, I'd probably reduce the frequency with which I patronize the venue.   Good People is my go-to for all other locals.

Birmingham,398otr,FalconHunter,2,Wed Jun 10 19:12:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not as big of a beer drinker as I used to be, now I stick mostly to bourbon, but I personally enjoy most off Avondale's offerings. Especially the Scottish ale and the Porter. I think what the Lake brothers are doing for the neighborhood is great and they deserve support in that, but it doesn't mean you have to drink their beer. I personally support all Good People has done for craft beer in the state, and they truly are good people, so I support what they are doing. That being said, I'm not really a fan of any of their beer. All of their beer is just way to hoppy. They jumped on the bitter train and never looked back. Hoppy has its place, but sometimes we want something crisp, or malty, or smokey, or even fruity. This is where I feel like Avondale passes them. Avondale offers a wider variety of taste. All that being said, I think Trim Tab is going to rise to the top of Birmingham craft beers."

I spoke with him (Craig) at Rojo probably 3-4 months ago, and he said he was doing something with vape supplies/store now, and that he was involved in the planning stages of a new brewery to be launched. He said he couldn't say anything much about it due to where they were in the planning process. I don't know what the status of that project is now though...  I don't know much about his knowledge/performance as a head brewer, but i've always found him to be a very kind, nice person, and I wish him the best in all of his future projects."

Both are required when hosting an event such as yours.  Yes, you can apply for one, but I guarantee you one will not be granted to an individual without a proper Certificate of Insurance (which requires AT LEAST a $1 million General Liability coverage).  Your best bet is to go with an established wedding venue.  Source: Former Property Manager"
Birmingham,399525,prettyhelmet,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:43:29 2015 UTC,Do you know what the technicalities are on when a private party (say if one just held a fairly large  party at a house or office)  qualifies as an event to require insurance and licensing and whatnot?    I'm all for squeaking by on technicalities if there's a possible gray area involved.
Birmingham,399525,prettyhelmet,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:24:45 2015 UTC,"Parties at a private residence are in that gray area.  A homeowner would not need an event license or an alcohol license.  An office, depending on if it is privately owned or managed by a Property Management company, is a little different.  The owner typically has General Liability insurance that covers any incidents on the property.  They may charge you a fee to cover any premiums. I hope that helps!"

Birmingham,395xi8,NJWhiskeyHunter,-2,Tue Jun 9 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that conservatives tend to be very hypocritical when it comes to personal freedoms versus freedoms of corporations.

Birmingham,395xi8,Jaclo,4,Wed Jun 10 00:48:57 2015 UTC,alcohol and cigarettes are both highly and truly addictive. Kratom provides a very mild sedating buzz. It's weaker than codeine FFS. It's hardly addiction in a bottle. All banning it will do is push people who like it towards more addicting substances like prescription painkillers. The same as making painkillers harder to get has pushed people to heroin. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Birmingham,395xi8,Jaclo,2,Wed Jun 10 00:51:23 2015 UTC,"I never said anything about regulation. They are just going to criminalize possession of this substance like they have done with countless others. Criminalization/=regulation. It's simply another excuse to send more people to jail or extract money from them during the judicial process.  Also as truly addictive, is alcohol somehow exempt from your rule?  What we need is regulation and legalization. That way people won't be trying these drugs on the street without any oversight whatsoever. And those that choose to use them, can without fear of a justice system that creates more problems for the individual than the problems it alleviates."
Birmingham,395xi8,throwinit9,0,Wed Jun 10 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"Criminalization is definitely a form of regulation. For example, it's illegal to purchase alcohol for minors. You'll be criminalized if you do. It's a form of regulating alcohol sales.  Alcohol is not exempt. I don't drink it and I find it absolutely bizarre that it's so openly tolerated, consider the sheer number of issues it causes, including the incredibly high number of unnecessary deaths.  The problem with giving people the freedom to try a drug, particularly an incredibly addictive one (say... Heroin) is that you're essentially encouraging addiction, simply because of how simple it is to become addicted.   People are dumb. I mean, cigarettes still sell incredibly well, despite the complete pointlessness and danger of them. And people still drink and drive. I would love to live in a world where we could trust humans to make smart decisions, but we don't. So, in order to prevent them from making poor decisions (that often affect others), the best method, objectively, is to remove the option."
Birmingham,395xi8,Jaclo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:09:12 2015 UTC,"objectively   I don't think this word was intended for the way you use it.   So, in order to prevent them from making poor decisions (that often affect others), the best method, objectively, is to remove the option.   That is one of the most frightening statements I've ever read. We might as well have the state raise our children (since some people make poor parenting decisions) and tell us what to eat as well (because people make poor decisions in that regard all the time)? What about forced exercise? TV rationing?"
Birmingham,395xi8,throwinit9,0,Wed Jun 10 04:29:57 2015 UTC,"It means exactly what I intended. If you strip away all emotion and bias and think, ""What's the best way to stop people from using this?"" The answer is, ""Get rid of it."" Logically, if you can't get it, you can't use it. Objectivity.  Forcing people to do things that cost money is not something I would ever condone, which is what would be the case if the government would try to select what people should eat (healthy eating is expensive).  The state already raises children who are deemed to have unfit parents. I think that's a good thing and that this particular system actually needs more funding, support, and regulation.  How did you make the jump from enacting regulations on dangerous substances to TV rationing? That's a similar jump that homophobes make when comparing gay marriage to bestiality.   At this point, I am assuming that you're a libertarian? A truly libertarian government will never work with such a massive population. Do you truly believe that things would be better if every person were allowed to do whatever they pleased? Not just people you know. Not just intelligent people. But, we the people?"

Birmingham,393ghy,Nordoisthebest,2,Tue Jun 9 12:44:14 2015 UTC,"Most folks who play Smash Wii U competitively use the GC controller as opposed to the wii u or wii u pro controllers.  If your muscle memory has developed substantially for one type of controller, it would be quite frustrating to transition to the other.  The differences between the two types of controllers people use are substantial.  I honestly can't think of any major tournaments that would not allow usage of the GC controllers.  This has been a bit of an issue in the states because to use the GC controller you have to use an appropriate adapter.  The Wii U adapter for the longest time was in short supply, and as such had a high demand.  There are several 3rd party replacements that will work in its stead.  Now, the other really important question would be whether or not customs are going to be allowed or not.  The matchups play out quite a bit different if you allow them versus not.  And, if you allow them, you have to have all the custom movesets unlocked, which is a time investment per console."

Birmingham,392ne2,jmwbama311,2,Tue Jun 9 05:27:02 2015 UTC,Yup windows by the elevators not from the jail. The jail is immediately to the left from that view. Those are all the deputies cars and a few court staff.
Birmingham,392ne2,Everwinter81,2,Wed Jun 10 15:24:37 2015 UTC,I get calls fairly regularly from someone in prison wanting to talk about their case. I had to call the Bar and ask for an ethics opinion about whether I was allowed to talk to them.  Short answer was just tell them to call you on approved jail phone and hang up.

He was also a former record label employee (Trustkill, I think?) and guitarist for .hopesfall.  I believe he passed away from heart trouble.  It was pretty sudden, from what I understand."

Birmingham,391xx3,AUBeastmaster,2,Mon Jun 8 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, only met him once, but he was a super outgoing dude and was always positive. I was pretty shocked when I heard too.   He wasn't a native, but he had made Bham his home, and that was pretty rad."
Birmingham,391xx3,Yosemite97,2,Tue Jun 9 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"He wasn't a part-owner of the brewery. He was hired in 2014 to be the taproom manager. Apparently he died suddenly (heart attack) when getting ready for work one morning, completely out of the blue."
Birmingham,391xx3,jmwbama311,2,Tue Jun 9 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"He was an exceptionally nice, genuine person. Wasn't a part-owner, but was tap-room manager. He had recently (within 2-3 months) been given a promotion/pay raise by Harris, and I ran into him/them the night he was told about it.   Apparently Harris had built up some suspense and surprise around the announcement. Told him to dress for a nice dinner, took him out to eat, and then told him how much he appreciated his dedication to the job, and wanted him to know of his commitment to his employment while dining. Cory was super excited about it when I ran into him later that evening at Dave's Pub.   In my opinion all the folks over at Trim Tab are top-notch exceptional folks, and Cory was too. Rest in peace brother-"

Birmingham,39396q,southsam,5,Mon Jun 8 23:02:32 2015 UTC,I get a shipt delivery probably twice a week & I haven't tipped. I think I would if someone went above and beyond. But so far myself and all my coworkers have not tipped.
Birmingham,39396q,malloryhair,4,Mon Jun 8 23:41:35 2015 UTC,Same thing here.
Birmingham,39396q,AUChris03,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:47:38 2015 UTC,Hey everyone! This is what we have been telling our drivers and customers. Our drivers are compensated well for their work but if you feel like the shopper went above and beyond then feel free! We're also looking at integrating an optional tipping feature into the app for people that want to use it.
Birmingham,39396q,ShiptGroceries,2,Wed Jun 10 20:38:28 2015 UTC,tips are not expected and that they pay their drivers a good hourly rate
Birmingham,39396q,SNOTcorn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:01:37 2015 UTC,"They don't get an hourly wage in the same sense that most other workers do. It's an ""independent contractor"" job and they only get paid by deliveries. I believe it was $6 per delivery when they first started up. And each driver is essentially competing with all other drivers for deliveries. So, during any given shift, you could get zero deliveries or two or ten. If you ended up only making one delivery per hour, you'd essentially be making $6 an hour, while also adding wear to your car and using up your own gas.  That's how it was at the beginning of this year anyway. No idea if it's changed at all."
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,3,Tue Jun 9 02:33:27 2015 UTC,"They can deduct these expenses on their tax return, either by using the federal mileage rate or by tracking all business-related car expenses. So at least that helps."
Birmingham,39396q,willco17,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:00:37 2015 UTC,Definitely. A smart thing to do.
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:13:12 2015 UTC,You're correct about the shopper working as an independent contractor but we have indeed updated our pay structure since the early days of Shipt. The shoppers now get base pay per delivery plus a commission based on how big the order is. We want the work to be worth our shopper's time and effort!
Birmingham,39396q,ShiptGroceries,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. Thanks for the correction."
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,-9,Thu Jun 11 12:56:20 2015 UTC,"If anyone deserves a tip, it's people who use their own vehicles and gas to make deliveries. Not servers, nor hairdressers, nor doormen."
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,2,Tue Jun 9 00:09:14 2015 UTC,Agree to disagree. Apples and oranges.
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,-5,Tue Jun 9 00:22:36 2015 UTC,"I never mind someone disagreeing with me, but would you care to explain why? Don't forget that servers make minimum wage if their tips don't exceed it."
Birmingham,39396q,jeeble,3,Tue Jun 9 00:28:52 2015 UTC,That's just not true.
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,-1,Tue Jun 9 02:20:10 2015 UTC,"It absolutely is. Federal law. There is literally a sign in every workplace, as dictated by federal law, that explains it."
Birmingham,39396q,jeeble,2,Tue Jun 9 02:24:32 2015 UTC,"I don't want to have a circular internet argument about it, but I just can't fathom not wanting to tip someone providing a service to me."
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,-1,Tue Jun 9 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"Let's not argue then. Let's discuss. I'm much-more open to opposing views than the average Redditor.  Where do you draw the line? Do you tip people at Auto Zone for replacing your battery, blades, etc...? Fast-food workers (anything from Taziki's to Subway to Hardee's)? Whomever you do tip, what are the factors that you use to determine if tipping should be done or not? ""Providing a service"" is a very broad phrase."
Birmingham,39396q,jeeble,2,Tue Jun 9 02:43:00 2015 UTC,"I tip at least 20% at restaurants and bars, including to go orders and places with counter service, because many times the person behind the counter is still making a server's wage. I tip hair dressers and cab drivers and food delivery drivers. Basically, I just try to be kind and a customer that leaves a positive impression on someone rather than bumming them out by being a stingy dick. It works for me."
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,-4,Tue Jun 9 02:50:41 2015 UTC,"Whatever floats your boat, I suppose. But one shouldn't assume that anyone who doesn't tip any particular profession is a ""stingy dick."" Fundamental Attribution Error. Could be a lower-class couple trying to celebrate a special anniversary, but who can't afford to throw an additional 20% of the check on top of it. Society in this country revolves around the idea that a lot of people will simply have to be at the bottom. They too deserve to get out every once in a while, and it shouldn't be at the cost of helping someone else earn more per hour than they do themselves."
Birmingham,39396q,jeeble,7,Tue Jun 9 02:58:33 2015 UTC,They should factor the tip into their budget when choosing where to go.
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,2,Tue Jun 9 03:02:27 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's federal law. But if you believe that there is a single restaurant anywhere that does this, I've got a bridge or two to sell you."
Birmingham,39396q,Nordoisthebest,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:52:31 2015 UTC,"That is a problem that the workers should absolutely address. I don't see why, of all professions, servers' decisions to not demand change (and why would they, when tips equal more than minimum wage) means that I have to subsidize their wage anytime I go out to eat."
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,3,Wed Jun 10 00:53:59 2015 UTC,Someone has clearly never worked in a service job. You'd be hard pressed to have an employer that will reimburse a server.
Birmingham,39396q,Nordoisthebest,-2,Tue Jun 9 00:57:01 2015 UTC,That's straight-up illegal. Against federal law. A lawsuit would likely be in order.
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,3,Tue Jun 9 02:23:47 2015 UTC,Yes it is. Does anyone in the service industry have the kind of capital to take it to court? Nope.
Birmingham,39396q,jeeble,-2,Tue Jun 9 02:28:22 2015 UTC,"So, instead... The workers just take it and then expect the patrons to subsidize their pay (in excess of minimum wage, on average)? Sounds like a broken system. Why support it?  And I'm nearly positive that there are firms out there that would take the case gratis, knowing that the suit would succeed. Because of federal law."
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,3,Tue Jun 9 02:37:13 2015 UTC,Not supporting the servers is not the way to fix the broken system.
Birmingham,39396q,jeeble,-2,Tue Jun 9 02:39:09 2015 UTC,"Change also can't be made by perpetuating the system. By necessity, change will come sooner when patrons stop tipping servers."
Birmingham,39396q,jcpham,3,Tue Jun 9 02:46:05 2015 UTC,"Riiiiight, because in our society, further depriving people on the lowest rung of the totem pole gets people at the top to make changes..."
Birmingham,39396q,Jaclo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:57:59 2015 UTC,"Last time I waited tables it was like 3 bucks an hour, it's perfectly legal to pay someone who works for tips less than minimum wage."

I would also suggest that she reach out to Pangea Two and/or ITAC Solutions. They are solid in terms of staffing agencies. They tend to have primarily administrative work available."

Birmingham,38yrzu,T_DMac,2,Mon Jun 8 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"From what i've heard a lot of people are clueless about them and i think it's a very cool part of the city that's not highlighted, like the crime is.   I think the bolded section sums it up nicely.   Basically, what happens is that the long-time residents of the area made up their minds about what was and wasn't safe or interesting and they stuck to it as they grew older. As they met new people, they shared their fears and concerns of these outdated and antiquated biases. So then it just sorta stuck.   Alternately - you have residents with their finger on the pulse and a willingness to maintain a zest for life and enjoy things that aren't cliche (Nana Funks, Rare Martini,) aren't in the same boring places (Southside, Lakeview,) and don't involve entertainment that basically amounts to a bunch of nothing more than Top 40 remixes or Pop-Hop grinding music with vile conditions.   Now we have things like 2nd Ave N, Uptown (though I loathe it), Avondale, and more every day.  If you want crime you can go looking for it, but Downtown east of I65 and south of the BJCC isn't where you'll find it. As more and more new venues open up, that element is being ousted with no where to go but ""away.""   I don't know who your sources are about downtown, but let them keep thinking that. More room for us and the people that we share it with."

Birmingham,38po4b,FalconHunter,4,Sat Jun 6 00:00:40 2015 UTC,"It's worth mentioning that Avondale is not downtown.  As for downtown:  Carrigans public house has good drinks and food.  Brick and Tin do a Friday night menu.   Continental bakery/Chez Lulu often has music on the weekend nights.  Paramount is good beer and decent bar food but not ""nice,"" in that it's casual and cool to go in shorts and flipflops.  *how could I forget to add John City Diner? Consistantly good food and great service. One of my favorite places in town for a nice dinner and drinks."
Birmingham,38pt8o,Hunter_behindthelens,4,Fri Jun 5 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"I am selling my Alienware M18x gaming laptop, and wanted to see if Reddit had anyone interested. I am moving to an all Mac world, so I don't really use this beauty much anymore.   Monster 18"" 1080p display, duel SSD+HDD, older nVidia 560m, quad-core i7. Runs most games without breaking a sweat for a laptop. I have mainly used it as a video/photo editing machine tho.    Asking $1100, but for a redditor I'll knock $100 off!  edit: Forgot to mention, that includes matching Alienware branded laptop bag, Xbox USB controller, Alienware Mousepad, and a Dell mouse.   edit edit: $800, and going to including a set of Skullcandy over ear headphones."

Amazon has a new MSI laptop with a 960m and a current generation i7 CPU for $1000 and half the weight. Considering what can be bought today for $1000, I think a more fair price for your machine would be $300-$400."

When trying to appraise the laptop you cannot overlook the fact that it's used. Wear and tear is real, and after 3-4 years it gets noticeable.   Find an $800- $1000 laptop on Amazon that you really like and would consider buying for yourself. Now imagine that you just bought it and someone offers to trade with you. Your new laptop for this one. Would you do it? You've got 4-5 years of life in front of you with your new machine. Would you trade it for one that already has 3-4 years gone?"

I have some buddies that play board games and some RPGs at the local coffee shop and at our houses at times.    What part of town are you living in?

There's your standard board games but they also have console games and people will bring games like the ones you mentioned. Library provides drinks and snacks as well as giveaways for prizes. Age range is pretty much college age and up.

You can rent one for a day at cahaba cycles and take it out to oak mountain state park if you want to try! Depending where you live you can find basketball leagues. There's a kickball league and an ultimate frisbee league. I recommend joining YP for the monthly socials, the membership card will pay for itself in covers if you like to drink.

If she wanted to do what was best for her district, she wouldn't have compared the reduction from 168 to 28 attendees for a fluff trip to Anchorage (gov't paid vacation - let's be honest) to the bloody political workings of South Africa.   What she wants is to work the system in her benefit and her public comments have shown that over time.   She doesn't get any kind of kickback or reward from UAB football coming back, so she has no interest in it - despite the clear public demand for the opposite."
Birmingham,38j6ah,FalconHunter,2,Thu Jun 4 21:52:35 2015 UTC,"despite the clear public demand for the opposite.   Was there a poll of those living in her district that I missed? To be honest I've never seen any city-wide polls on a.) bringing football back, or b.) providing public funding for it."

If you pay attention to the news on a daily basis as well as following social media and other forms of direct community interaction, people inside and outside of Birmingham have been calling for the reinstatement of the UAB football program since the day it was killed.

Birmingham,38j6ah,Cardnil,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, no she didn't.   Just five of the nine council members were present May 12 when the group approved the resolution.  Council members Austin, Valerie Abbott, Steven Hoyt, Marcus Lundy and William Parker were present and voted for the resolution.   What was so important that Tyson (and Roberson) weren't able to come to the council meeting to do their jobs?"
Birmingham,38j6ah,MisterTito,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:24:21 2015 UTC,"So now that she was outvoted and in the minority, she's going to once again stand on her soapbox and whine until she gets her way? Did she ever explain WHY she voted the way that she did?   ""Tyson cited a list of dilapidated buildings and residential buildings that stand as health and safety hazards.""   Yeah, well, the first thing I'd research would be her input on the budget for this year. Has anyone ever willingly attended at budget meeting? It's dry, boring, and that's usually what the journalists are there for. I'd want to know what programs she opted to keep and which ones she wanted to cut.  Speculation, here, but based on previous attendance of those meetings, I'm willing to wager she didn't support cutting much - certainly nothing that could have be reallocated to the projects that she's claiming the money could be better used for.  And then let's talk about the City Council's nasty habit of driving businesses out of downtown in the past. There used to be a significant luxury car dealership downtown - long gone because the City Council wanted to levy more taxes on businesses in the downtown area.   If Tyson wants those building fixed, cleaned up, etc, then perhaps she should steer commerce and revitalization in such a way that those same things she complained about when campaigning come to fruition through private enterprise (homebuyers, new business, etc.) Downtown is the hip place to be right now. Tyson can capitalize on that or she can continue her perpetual re-election campaign through the use of divisive language and politics."
Birmingham,38j6ah,FalconHunter,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:04:50 2015 UTC,"If Tyson wants those building fixed, cleaned up, etc, then perhaps she should steer commerce and revitalization in such a way that those same things she complained about when campaigning come to fruition through private enterprise   Even furthermore on that point, I want to know exactly what buildings she wants taken care of. I would think that someone owns the properties and it should be the property owner's responsibility to restore or tear down those buildings. The city shouldn't be in the business of cleaning up after lazy property owners.   Just as people want to say ""why should my tax dollars go to football,"" well why should my tax dollars go to cleaning up some other private party's mess? If the property is a blight, have the city condemn it and take control of the property. Tear down the blight and then sell the land to offset the cost of removing the blight. Or, even better, condemn and take control of the property, then sell it for cheap contingent on the new owner removing the blight within X number of days. That would have no outlay for the city other than paperwork.   Now, on the other hand, if they are city-owned properties then why is it just now becoming an issue she thinks is urgent? It takes a while for buildings to reach a state of dilapidation. Maybe she should have advocated for money to fix the properties years ago ... but I guess she and the rest of the city council were too busy spending money on travel."
Birmingham,38j6ah,MisterTito,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:14:01 2015 UTC,"The city shouldn't be in the business of cleaning up after lazy property owners.   They're not, actually. There have been times where I've seen the city go out and clean up the areas AROUND those property (City Works, I think) but that's all. Regularly, there are agenda items on City Council meetings where they will address reports of eyesores or derelict properties and decide what to do about them. Basically, if they can locate or contact the property owner, they tell them to clean it up or else. The ""or else"" is something I've never followed-up on and I don't know what they do if they can't contact the property owner. The most they'll do actively - in my experience - is to tell them to clean it up, though.   Now, if the neighborhood is full of abandoned properties and/or vacant lots, and there's trash dumping in those lots (happens a LOT), then it's on the city to address if there's no identifiable land owner. Carol Smitherman used to lead ""goodwill"" efforts into some communities in hers and her husband's districts to organize volunteer cleanups and she and Roger actually got into the thick of it with the other volunteers. I may not like their politics, but when they were out there doing that (even with the cameras off) they were actually humanized by the hard work they put in. They along with UAB, BSC, and Miles students really made a difference in about a dozen yards on a single Saturday. I suggest Tyson explore doing the same thing if she hasn't already...   Now, on the other hand, if they are city-owned properties then why is it just now becoming an issue she thinks is urgent?   I would speculate that it's because she needs some form of soapbox to stand on so that people will listen to her blathering and think her to be active and/or relevant.  She's fairly new to the Council, but she campaigned on the issue, so  like you asked, why is it just NOW relevant to her interests? Answer? I speculate it's because it takes potential money away from her and her projects...  And, yes - between the failed DNC bid ($275,000 for a consulting firm to ""lobby"" for an impossible selection) and the travel junkets in the name of ""community development"" that have at times included 168 people (many of which not directly connected to the Council, merely friends, family, and 'consultants' for community development groups - fancy name for a tea-social-like get together) and it's easy to see where the priorities lie with the Council - ironically, it's not with the betterment of the downtown part of the CITY."

So, if the businesses and land are seized, does that mean they're going to be auctioned off? That's some prime real estate right there. DOJ will make a pretty penny in an auction."

Birmingham,38f06h,Julius_Henry_Marx,2,Fri Jun 12 11:54:06 2015 UTC,"It might just be headline bait and not be significant. A lot of the store owners' names sound arabic, and they might have just been wiring money back home. But the fact that Homeland Security was involved in the investigation might have led to something. It'll be interesting to see what comes of this.  That list of agencies involved is fascinating though:   The District Attorney's Office, the FBI, the Gardendale Police Department, the USDA, the Alabama Department of Human Resources  and the Secret Service all worked together on the investigation. Birmingham police, the U.S. Marshals, the Internal Revenue Service, Homeland Security Investigations, Walmart Global Operations, Hoover police, Pelham police and the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency helped with today's raid in a specially-formed task force."
Birmingham,38f06h,davehudson88,3,Wed Jun 3 19:58:21 2015 UTC,Walmart is law enforcement now? Goddamn.
Birmingham,38f06h,Peeps_Chicken,3,Wed Jun 3 20:17:56 2015 UTC,"They aren't law enforcement. They're corporate security. They soley investigate crimes against Wal-Mart or Sam's, and if they find a crime that they want to press charges on, they turn the matter over to law enforcement. They aren't gun toters. They can't obtain or execute search warrants or anything like that."
Birmingham,38f06h,davehudson88,2,Thu Jun 4 01:25:30 2015 UTC,"Crazy, right? What's even more crazy is that Walmart was already on the case by the time actual law enforcement came into the picture.   Investigators contacted Walmart's Global Investigations Unit in an effort to let them know they would like to attempt to sell property represented to be stolen to those stores, but when they told Walmart the nature of their probe, they learned the conglomerate was already investigating those two convenience stores for EBT fraud."

Birmingham,38g5u3,ImmaSpazz,7,Thu Jun 4 00:12:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, you're going to live in Hoover without a car? Have you considered getting a place close to campus?  Where in Hoover will you be? There's a bus line that goes from the Galleria to downtown, with a stop at UAB."

I am in the works of looking for a closer place but that might not be an option for me due to some other reasons.   How is the bus line? I've been strongly suggested not to use the bus due to it being unreliable and sketchy apparently. I would just bike but I hear that's not ideal either when it's so humid and hot."
Birmingham,38g5u3,mixduptransistor,3,Thu Jun 4 03:14:18 2015 UTC,"Most of the people who complain about the buses never ride them. I know lots of professionals at UAB who ride the Hwy 31 route from the Galleria or Vestavia into town. Also, biking from Hoover into downtown is going to be a real bitch even if it's not hot. You'll have to come over Shades Mountain, and the roads aren't that bike friendly."

Birmingham,38g5u3,willco17,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:50:02 2015 UTC,I'm guessing Bluff Park area. I would in NO WAY want any part of traveling to downtown Birmingham from Hoover by bus or bike-- it was bad enough commuting for work and school.
Birmingham,38g5u3,merely_mere,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:30:18 2015 UTC,Would you mind elaborating on this? In particular about the bus situation. Why would you avoid the bus and such so much? Do you find it unreliable? or? There is a bus that I could take that seems doable. Is the bus safe?
Birmingham,38g5u3,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:06:44 2015 UTC,"They have a reputation for not being reliable but I'm guessing most people here don't have much personal experience, especially with the Galleria route. I would expect the time on the schedule to vary a lot depending on traffic on Hwy 31. There's a lot of room for things to go wrong.   Plus, I'm assuming Shades Cliff is near the Alford Ave. exit, so you'd have to go 4 miles south to I-459 and then one exit over to get to the Galleria, just to head back north. The University Blvd. exit is only 5 miles north of Alford in the first place.   I can't look up the routes right now but maybe you can get on the bus somewhere on 31 and not have to go all the way to the Galleria. But then you'd probably have to bike over to 31, which would be pretty dangerous during commute times.."
Birmingham,38g5u3,felixlgato,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"https://www.bjcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HWY-31-SOUTH.pdf This seems to be the applicable schedule for you. I have not, personally, used the Birmingham bus system. I have had experience dealing with others who have used the bus system and they found it lacking. I commented here:http://www.reddit.com/r/Birmingham/comments/3876u1/the_route_of_division_on_a_birmingham_bus/crtcmuo?context=3  about this a few days ago. This was with clients using the Birmingham-area routes, not the route that runs through Hoover. It is possible that the Hoover route runs more reliably. Traffic could be very bad in the mornings when I was driving from the Valleydale Road exit into downtown or UAB-- leaving 5 minutes later could mean a half hour or longer added on to my drive in the mornings. Again, I haven't used the bus system here."

Do those women live in an abandoned furniture building? Of course not.  The only reason that photo was used was to shove a narrative forward that Downtown Birmingham is dreary awful place with nothing but rundown abandoned buildings and essentially acting like it is a ""slum"".

Birmingham,3876u1,MichaelTunnell,2,Tue Jun 2 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing. Took me a few minutes to figure out where that was but it's literally steps from a largely revitalized part of downtown and across the street from Dog Days. Far from a gleaming beacon of rebirth, but it certainly has nothing to do with the story. Maybe she's attempting to say that these women could have jobs at the furniture store closer to their homes if not for the flight to the suburbs?  Photo credits to @drakeycake from Athens, GA. Not sure why a local photographer wasn't used when the author is actually local."
Birmingham,3876u1,southsam,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:52:20 2015 UTC,"The photos were made a year before the article, they just found then it seems. The furniture store has been closed for years so can't be for working there."

Birmingham,3876u1,badat_reddit,5,Tue Jun 2 21:34:11 2015 UTC,"I remember reading an article, back when everyone was going nuts over the Crestline Piggly Wiggly closing, where a customer GAVE a car to Arrelia to drive (cashier) so that she didn't have to take the bus anymore so she didn't have to worry about being late, waiting in the rain, etc. When I worked with low-income clients who received daycare assistance, we had clients who would call in a panic because the bus was an hour late for their appointments, two hours late... and then would wait another hour or two at the bus stop to get back home. With a baby or two. If Birmingham wants to grow, we need better public transportation with expanded routes-- and somewhere to go."

There's a market for housecleaning over the mountain, the labor force just happens to live downtown. Is that wrong? Should they hire immigrants instead? Are market forces inherently racist?  The truth is the ladies get paid well enough to keep taking the Cherokee bus, otherwise they'd stop, and my experiences with the families hiring them suggests the relationship is amicable as well as professional.   Heck, my grandmother used to live in north Birmingham and her housekeeping assistant (not white) was an integral part of the family, and had to decline many invitations from my grandfather to stay in the spare bedroom after a long day.   Birmingham is such an easy target for BigJournalism, when the city itself is administered almost wholly by the group of people commonly perceived to have no power. It's beyond tiresome."

Birmingham,3876u1,MichaelTunnell,2,Tue Jun 2 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that it was implying things haven't changed. Just that they aren't all great and wonderful like some people want to make it out to be.   Mass transit, education and reasonable job opportunities in the city proper have been a heavy lift since the Civil Rights Movement because they don't affect the more affluent people on the city's edges.  It's only issue of race in regards to the legacy of white flight which created poor economic circumstances for those left behind in the process. Pointing that out isn't an attempt to make Birmingham look bad, it's addressing reality."

Birmingham,3876u1,catonic,3,Tue Jun 2 21:14:04 2015 UTC,"The narrative itself implies a kind of indentured servitude. The imagery of the bus camaraderie on the way to houses evokes songs on the way to the fields, and having to call ""the boss"" to apologize for being late sounded servile. The whole thing reads like the author was shocked to learn that rich people had housekeepers who weren't white.  I mean, look at this passage:   “You know [the woman's bosses] had given her presents and a good bit of money, but that’s not what she needed, she needed a ride home.   Written in a tone that says ""man fuck rich people, they're so generous in the wrong way."" I get it. She wanted a ride home, not bucks and baubles, but stuff like this attempts to undermine and invalidate the sincerity of people like my grandparents, and I resent that."
Birmingham,3876u1,loltidderkcuf,3,Tue Jun 2 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"stuff like this attempts to undermine and invalidate the sincerity of people like my grandparents, and I resent that.   So you're just projecting from a defense posture. I think you're seeing things that aren't there. I don't think calling your boss to apologize for being late is ""servile."" As for evoking imagery of ""songs on the way to the field"" ... you really have to dig to get that impression. I mean, do you expect the author to describe a bunch of ladies in roughly the same age group doing the same work as not having some kind of camaraderie? That's ridiculous."
Birmingham,3876u1,MisterTito,2,Tue Jun 2 16:59:25 2015 UTC,"You're right, I am reading this from a different perspective than most people, namely that of a person having lived in the shadow of Birmingham for a quarter-century, and ridiculed by everyone around the country when I traveled for bombs, dogs, and fire hoses.  I've seen the city consistently targeted for racially charged journalism and histories, and stories like this ignore class-conflict and frame the narrative in a racial light. For example, the words ""white"" and ""black"" were used 14 times each, while the words ""class"" and ""labor"" weren't used at all - ""income"" came up twice. I know white housecleaners and caregivers, and I know a higher income black family in Vestavia who hired maids. Who's going to write those stories? Probably nobody, because it's not as reliable of a narrative as ""adorable, stoic old black ladies busing to work in affluent suburbia.""  If I sound defensive, it's because I was born into guilt, just like every other white person in the Deep South. I guess it's only fair that my interpretation be taken with the same grain of salt as I take stories like this."
Birmingham,3876u1,loltidderkcuf,8,Tue Jun 2 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, sure, jobs are good even if these aren't ideal. (Or Ideal.) But everything here is connected both to Birmingham's inequality and the legacy of race relations. Ask yourself why do the poor black people live in one place and the rich whites in another, and why aren't any whites taking the bus in the other direction to clean black people's houses? Why are the buses so unreliable and the routes so poorly designed?  You also point out that it doesn't address class. Well, why is class so strongly aligned with race?   I thought this article was entirely fair and spoke to the general by using the specific. I agree that it's easy to go overboard with that synecdoche but in this case I think it works well.  I get tired of the city's rep too - I love it here - but you don't need rose-colored glasses to enjoy where you live."
Birmingham,3876u1,grinchman042,2,Tue Jun 2 20:01:14 2015 UTC,Your last paragraph resonates with me.
Birmingham,3876u1,Everwinter81,3,Tue Jun 2 19:16:40 2015 UTC,Totally missed the point. It's more about the broken transportation system of the city than the fact that rich white people hire poor black people to do their cleaning. (as fucked up as that is on its own)
Birmingham,3876u1,mixduptransistor,4,Tue Jun 2 15:35:57 2015 UTC,"You think it's fucked up that poor black ladies have jobs? Do you think it would be more fair for Mtn Brook families to underpay Consuela or hire corporate home-to-home services like Molly Maids, Merry Maids, etc? Sure, that makes sense, because at least then these old ladies could preserve their ""racial dignity"" by going on welfare.   And how is the transportation system broken? If anything, it's merely developing with demand. I've been on Birmingham buses, and I've been on buses in DC, New Orleans, Miami, Boston, Vancouver, Atlanta, New York, etc. and I'll tell you that Birmingham's buses are empty by comparison. There's been no market for them. Previously, Birmingham would have to allocate millions of tax dollars to subsidize an unprofitable and underutilized network of bus routes, zig zagging throughout a city where 84% of the households rely on their own cars for transportation (a.o. 2000 Census).  If you're pissed about the transportation system, form a petition and I'll sign it. Expanded busing would allow people to sell their cars and move that money into living improvements, healthcare, or education. I'm all for that, but don't sit around whining about perceived inequalities and broken systems like some over-privileged hipster."

Birmingham,3876u1,Everwinter81,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"Enjoyed the article, but I wish it hadn't focused so much on a route symbolic of Birmingham's divides.  The whole system could be used as the same metaphor, the entire transit network only able to somewhat breach the region's racial and income divides, and starved for resources.  Riders on the #6 Pratt-Ensley, or the #40 Fairmont, or the #20-Zion City have similar difficulties - their routes run more than once out and back in per day, but they still suffer long wait times, limited access to jobs due to poor bus system coverage (because so many cities won't buy in), and similar struggles.  It could have made a stronger and more poignant point about the city's fractures and inequities, but instead focused so much on a minimally-serviced route that serves an extremely limited group of folks, summoning the wispy ghosts of personal racism past rather than the shadows of the institutional racism and classism of the present."

Now we all get to have ""the conversation"" about UAB football and how it can be turned into a revenue driver to make the athletic department financially independent, which should be the end goal.

Birmingham,383xsh,StumbleBees,3,Mon Jun 1 21:23:19 2015 UTC,"It was rash to cut football based on 1 faulty report.   Agreed.   And it's rash to bring it back just because people are upset.   I'd agree with this if I felt it was ""just because people are upset"" but I don't think this is the only reason. The report was found faulty because when people investigated its sources, they found the things it found to be bad, were actually not so bad, and it missed things that were good. That is, it's not just that people are upset, but in finding fault in the report, it's been revealed that the opposite of the report's conclusion are true. People are upset because of this (well, that's being generous; some people are probably just upset because they wanted 'da football, of course, but I feel a good number of the people concerned are actually concerned because they have legitimate reasons to believe it's a good thing.)"

Birmingham,383xsh,frenchtoastking17,9,Mon Jun 1 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, according to them we are all worthless for not quitting our jobs to campaign for a team we don't personally care about.   I think that whether you're a fan of UAB football or not, there's room to recognize that the problem the football debacle highlighted revealed a bigger issue than that of football... UAB's leadership is not in sync with UAB's faculty, alumni or students, and the governing board, UA's Board of Trustees, has an inappropriate level of control over UAB (which in turn is half of Birmingham.)  I don't know if that's ""shut down everything"" level of action-required, but I'd at least think it's ""strongly worded letter"" or ""share this on facebook"" level of concern."
Birmingham,383xsh,Thoguth,6,Mon Jun 1 23:18:09 2015 UTC,"Edit: are the down votes because I'm not using enough hash tags?   Not a downvoter, but my guess is the downvoting is because your hyperbolic statement appears to be kind of inaccurate and mean-spirited. I imagine a lot of people from Birmingham are football fans... which means that there are good chances a lot of regular /r/Birmingham subscribers are also /r/CFB members. If so, then readers/voters in this sub, who also identify as members of that sub, would see this as kind of a personal petty insult.  I don't know though. About half the time I get downvoted I have no clue why. It would be nice if downvoters replied to tell you why."
Birmingham,383xsh,Thoguth,-2,Tue Jun 2 00:34:39 2015 UTC,"I'm just trolling, but I appreciate the honest response.   Honestly, I think Birmingham would be better off if UAB had a decent program. I'm just not sure the support is there to make it happen-from the decision makers down to the general population."
Birmingham,383xsh,frenchtoastking17,2,Tue Jun 2 02:20:51 2015 UTC,"Well, it doesn't have to be a top-eschelon program; even a UCF-like program, a regular bowl contender and competitive in their conference, would be worth having. I'd think that with all the doctors that are UAB grads (and probably some entrepreneurs, though in my experience at UAB there wasn't a lot to nurture entrepreneurialism at the time) there's at least the possibility of some good money getting into the program. Of course that might be what UA fears, since money steered toward UAB's program is money that might have gone toward UA's program instead."
Birmingham,383xsh,Thoguth,9,Tue Jun 2 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"This would have been preferable to deleting UAB posts, forcing a single thread for UAB related discussion, banning discussion of UAB and then immediately rescinding the ban like it didn't happen."
Birmingham,383xsh,ndjs22,-1,Mon Jun 1 21:41:16 2015 UTC,"I understand your point, but it doesn't make sense as a reply to my post.   People quitting their jobs to campaign for a movement they didn't care about would be preferable to strict message board guidelines?"
Birmingham,383xsh,frenchtoastking17,7,Mon Jun 1 21:45:11 2015 UTC,"I ignored the ""quit our jobs"" line as it was irrelevant and not ever one of the requirements for being a fan or supporting the team."

Birmingham,383xsh,GD7901,6,Mon Jun 1 22:25:53 2015 UTC,"Here is the email sent to students and staff:  Students, faculty and staff,  Good afternoon.   The last six months provided a great opportunity to have candid and constructive conversations with our students, faculty, staff, alumni, community leaders and supporters, allowing a thoughtful review of the decision to discontinue football, bowling and rifle.  I would like to offer my sincerest appreciation to all who have worked constructively to bring us to a new place regarding our strategic plan in athletics and across UAB, and to a broader base of support within UAB and across our community.    We have witnessed a level of support never before seen for UAB Athletics, and today I am announcing that we are taking steps to reinstate the football, rifle and bowling programs with a plan that combines private support with institutional funding.   Thanks to the efforts of a fundraising subcommittee of the Athletics Assessment Task Force, business leaders in Birmingham and our development office, we have received pledges large and small from many donors and fans. Many are from people who have never before supported UAB football, and in unprecedented amounts. Our alumni society and students have committed to support this effort, along with the City of Birmingham. All of this is exciting.    The institution will continue to subsidize Athletics at $20 million annually, but UAB's subsidy cannot expand at the expense of educational programs, research and our health care missions. Combined with the community's $17 million in pledges to support operations, we are off to a promising start to support sustained excellence in an Athletic Department that includes football, bowling and rifle. We and our supporters still have much work to be done to address facility needs.  Director of Athletics Mark Ingram, who has experience reinstating athletic programs, will lead the charge in implementing this plan with Athletic Department staff, and we will continue to engage with our supporters as we move forward. We are forwarding documents to Conference USA and the NCAA notifying them that UAB plans to remain an FBS program and a full member of C-USA.   Our commitment to excellence, service and prudent financial stewardship is stronger than ever. We must and will be successful because so many depend on us. There is a lot of work to do now. This is a new day for UAB Athletics, and without the support of the community, this wouldn't have happened. Everyone has pulled together, and that effort needs to continue.  Sincerely,  Ray L. Watts President"

Birmingham,383xsh,NJWhiskeyHunter,-7,Mon Jun 1 19:03:31 2015 UTC,Now let's see all these folks put their money where their mouth is. I'm going to trollolololol so hard when the attendance #s come out next year and there is no improvement.
Birmingham,383xsh,FalconHunter,5,Mon Jun 1 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"Half of the problem is that they're playing at Legion Field which is in the middle of one of the more rundown areas of town that most people have no desire to venture to. If they played at a venue that wasn't in the middle of a near-ghetto, you'd have better attendance."
Birmingham,383xsh,jmwbama311,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you about more than half of the problem with attendance is the current home location of their games. Legion Field is a shithole, and the neighborhood it is in is the same.   Ideally, there would be an awesome mixed-use stadium on/near campus. Nothing huge, maybe 30k-50k in size, with maybe even a track around it for expanded use of other sporting activities.   Until then, why don't they play their home games at The Hoover Met? It's a nice stadium, in a nice, safe neighborhood, not sure about attendance capacity, but it makes sense to me."
Birmingham,383xsh,FalconHunter,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"Hoover Met is too far away compared to Legion Field.   Seriously, if the City Council would dedicate their pandering to revitalizing the area around Legion Field instead of ignoring it, they'd probably get somewhere.   They did so with the area around the BJCC and it's starting to take effect.   They did so with the area around the airport and it's a much nicer looking area.   And yet North and West Birmingham are ignored and perpetuate as some of the more vile areas of town that most people avoid if they don't call it home or don't have a pressing reason to be there.   It won't be long before the success in Avondale continues to push East and, potentially, areas around Avondale begin to see the same revitalization in 5-8 years."
Birmingham,383xsh,NJWhiskeyHunter,-2,Tue Jun 2 18:00:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, maybe like the domed stadium that the city is supposed to be building with the extra tax they levied a few years ago?  IF UAB had anywhere other than Legion Field to play, and IF the students gave a shit about going, I'd be more supportive.  A vocal minority and some powerful backers threw a little hissy fit that their foosball was going away, and here we are.  This is business as usual in Alabama."
Birmingham,383xsh,FalconHunter,6,Mon Jun 1 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"I don't care where they end up playing as long as it's in an area of town that doesn't look like a cesspool.   Domed stadium? Sure.  Multi-use field downtown somewhere? Okay.  But for all of the history that Legion Field has, the City of Birmingham has done a magnificent job of allowing the area around it to become a complete fuck-up.  I'm still a student (degree #2) and I do give a shit about going, but I'm not going anywhere near Legion Field. It's not the team, it's the fucking location.   The rest of your comment is just the same kind of bitchiness that I've come to expect from your comments.  Don't like it? Don't go. It's not like you ever would have anyway."
Birmingham,383xsh,MisterTito,0,Tue Jun 2 02:23:43 2015 UTC,"IF UAB had anywhere other than Legion Field to play, and IF the students gave a shit about going, I'd be more supportive.   Neither of these things can happen if the program is dead. And giving UAB a better place to play turns into a chicken and egg conundrum where people say ""UAB would have better attendance if they had a better stadium"" followed by ""why build a better stadium for UAB, have you seen their attendance?"" At some point the city will have to take a leap of faith and ditch Legion Field.   This is business as usual in Alabama.   So is being cynical."
Birmingham,383xsh,NJWhiskeyHunter,-1,Mon Jun 1 23:00:22 2015 UTC,"Then they should have let it stay dead.  If neither of those things will improve, then it ain't worth saving."
Birmingham,383xsh,mixduptransistor,14,Tue Jun 2 00:07:23 2015 UTC,"Well, there was over 100% improvement in attendance from 2013 to 2014...."
Birmingham,383xsh,NJWhiskeyHunter,-8,Mon Jun 1 19:50:50 2015 UTC,"We'll see, won't we?"
Birmingham,383xsh,ericrz,7,Mon Jun 1 20:00:43 2015 UTC,"Winning brings fans.  Losing doesn't.  Plain and simple.  UAB's attendance last year was middle-of-the-pack for CUSA, which is probably the best UAB can hope for while playing at decrepit old Legion Field.  If Coach Clark stays around and gets some decent recruits, if the facilities (even if not the stadium) are improved, and UAB can string together some 7 or 8 win seasons, the fan support will stick around.  If not, the fans will probably bail, since the stadium is so cruddy.  No one likes to watch their team lose, but if the in-stadium experience is pleasant, fans will still come out (as a UVA employee, I can testify to this).  But if both the team and the stadium suck, no one will go.  I think it's silly to bring football back while discounting Jimmy Filler's offer to raise money for an on-campus facility."
Birmingham,383xsh,ndjs22,2,Mon Jun 1 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"As a graduate and long time fan, it's more than Ws and Ls. Yes, of course that matters, maybe more than anything else, but for a long time we've been stuck with coaches we didn't even want. Coach Clark is a spitfire and exactly what we needed, and I think not only the improved product but his attitude and engagement with the fans led to the increase in numbers."
Birmingham,383xsh,ericrz,5,Mon Jun 1 21:45:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Letting UAB make its own decisions would be huge.  Because honestly, if Coach Clark succeeds, someone else will poach him.  That's the nature of the business.  So the true test, I suppose, is this -- if Clark has a few 7- or 8- win seasons, and then is plucked by an SEC or Big 12 or ACC school, who comes next?  A coach foisted upon UAB by Tuscaloosa, or a coach UAB actually wants?"
Birmingham,383xsh,ndjs22,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:33:40 2015 UTC,"That is the, to quote Dr. Watts, ""17.new million dollar"" question."
Birmingham,383xsh,FalconHunter,5,Mon Jun 1 22:55:16 2015 UTC,"The stadium is passable.   It's the area AROUND the stadium that no one (hyperbolic) wants to travel to. It's a dangerous and sketchy area after dark and it's not welcoming in any way. Luckily, all of that disappears once you're in the stadium, but everything around it (short of BSC) is a disaster."
Birmingham,383xsh,ericrz,5,Mon Jun 1 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"True enough.  But an on-campus stadium, within walking distance for the increasing number of students living on-campus (or near-campus), and adjacent to the thriving Railroad Park / Regions Field / Midtown district, is the true long term solution for UAB Football.  Legion Field is a dead-end, and everyone knows it.  I grew up in Orlando, and it was controversial when UCF ditched the Citrus Bowl for their own OCS.  (Mainly on behalf of alumni, who would no longer be able to purchase beer in the stadium).  But that has turned out great for the Knights."
Birmingham,383xsh,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Mon Jun 1 22:36:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, my niece's boyfriend got jumped outside the stadium after he was done working a game.  Legion field is an outdated relic, and the neighborhood it is in is one that I simply won't go to after dark."
Birmingham,383xsh,FalconHunter,-5,Mon Jun 1 21:53:17 2015 UTC,"Stadium is fine. Neighborhood is trash. Just bulldoze the surrounding area and start over and we could realistically have a pretty good thing with a vintage stadium to boot.  Sadly, that won't happen because politics."
Birmingham,383xsh,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Tue Jun 2 02:25:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, who cares that people live there...  Flatten the stadium, put in a great park and set the neighborhood on the path to recovery."
Birmingham,383xsh,FalconHunter,-2,Tue Jun 2 05:01:52 2015 UTC,"who cares that people live there...   You call that ""living""? Looking are the area, I don't even think that THEY care that they occupy houses in the area. All they seem to do is stand outside during an event and wave cars into their muddy, torn up yards with a hand towel while charging $5-$20 a car.    Flatten the stadium, put in a great park and set the neighborhood on the path to recovery.   Buyout the residents, flatten the shanties, put in additional park area (would benefit BSC if the area ever became safe like downtown east of I-65) and make it a place that residents of the region WANT to travel to."

Birmingham,386odw,Philobus,2,Tue Jun 2 23:47:05 2015 UTC,"Our goal is to help promote things within the community and have events that engage with the customers. Magic City Con is happening within the community, they approached us to set up a table in our lobby and talk with customers. We agreed. They were having trouble finding cosplayers to come out for them, all of their regular people have gigs booked, so I took it upon myself to try and find a few people to do that.  Corporate Carmike wants us to do what we can to ensure that we are giving our guests a superior experience. One thing that we can do to provide that is to have ""special events"" for the release of films. For Furious 7 a race car club to showcased a few of their vehicles in our lobby. It was really cool. For Earth to Echo we had children at various Libraries paint Echo, and we hung up their artwork all over the theater. Expendables 3 featured the Marines and their pull up bar challenge (a guy chipped a tooth, that was hilarious! Yes there was a signed waiver.), Harley Davidson came out with two brand new bikes to show off (they were AWESOME), Vestavia Hills SWAT was out showing off their SWAT gear, we even had Gold's Gym giving out free stuff. All of these events were spectacular and incredibly fun to be part of. As far as cross promoting it with Jurassic World, the distributor for Jurassic World see this as the opportunity for FREE promotions for THEIR content. So long as we are not promoting a g-string clad Raptor, it'll be OK. Now, while we would prefer the costumes to be Jurassic World oriented, we know that that is a slim possibility so that's why I've opened it up to popular movie, cartoon, and comic book characters as well.   And you are more than welcome to show up in whatever you would like, however I would not expect you to stay there very long.   I would be more than happy to answer any more questions you have, and I do hope to see you out for the release of Jurassic World!"

After the game, some of the Knoxville players came up to shake our hands and thanked us for giving such a great atmosphere to the game.  They said we've given better support to the Hammers in their first few games than they've had for a long while, which is very high praise for such a young team."

Also had a chance to talk with the President of Nashville FC the first night (he was sitting next to the guy in the viking helmet) and he said the Hammers were already, in terms of support, lightyears ahead of most teams in the NPSL region with the exception of Nashville and Chattanooga but they've been in the game a bit longer."

We treat them all the same and as gently as possible. And some do fantastic while others fall apart. It's manufacturing that makes the difference. I always tell folks that if the beads and sequins are sewn on by hand then it will be fine. If the decoration was glued on by machine then it is a disposable dress only intended to be worn once.

Birmingham,37yl3q,HealerWarrior,1 point,Sun May 31 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"Yep.  There are a number of establishments that would be happy to accomodate OP, I'm certain, but OP should expect a room rental fee and a food/beverage minimum of $550 or more depending on the day of the week.  Also, finding a decent restaurant that offers wifi or an internet connection sufficient to support videoconferencing might be a problem.  Good restaurants generally don't offer things like that because people come there to enjoy the food, not spend three hours working on their laptops.    OP might check with corporate/chain restaurants like Panera Bread, Flemings, PF Changs, Chuy's, and that sort of thing.  Bottle and Bone has a side room that can be segregated, but I don't know if they offer wifi and such."

Birmingham,37yl3q,HelpdeskEngineer,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:15:09 2015 UTC,"AV equipment is one thing, dedicated internet fast enough to support videoconferencing may be another entirely.    I also kind of hate the steakhouse restaurant model.  I mean, shit, I've worked at a seafood place that has one of the best steaks in town.  If you were to order the steak we have at a steakhouse, it'd cost you $20 more and you have to pay an exorbitant price for each side.  Also, steakhouse chains generally have much more of a markup on wines.

Taxes like this compensate (maybe more than necessary) for the costs that go along with folks getting belligerent.

And what do they get out of that?  Not to mention that Jefferson County just built Gardendale High School, a school that was built with a Gardendale zone in mind that is much wider than just the city of Gardendale. And now Gardendale wants to take it without reimbursing the county. If you're a city in Jefferson County that doesn't have it's own system, good luck getting Jefferson County to ever build you a new school.  If this was truly for the kids and to improve funding for Gardendale schools, they would have passed the tax and given the money to Jefferson County with the stipulation that it be spent only in Gardendale. As it is, this is just an effort to keep up with the Joneses. Alabaster and Pelham got their own school systems, and Gardendale can't be left behind.

Birmingham,37rzl8,bpittin,0,Mon Jun 1 03:25:59 2015 UTC,I hope this keeps the Birmingham kids out of our schools that are bussed in.
Birmingham,37qr6i,THROBBINGRED,5,Fri May 29 17:20:21 2015 UTC,Has anyone ever talked to someone that just returned from an Uber friendly city and talked about how bad it sucked having Uber? I'm just curious. Consumers love it in my experience.
Birmingham,37qr6i,tedellis316,7,Sun May 31 13:32:28 2015 UTC,"Giving this power to Twinkle Cavanaugh would not have been a ""concession"". The saying goes ""cut your nose off to spite your face"" but that would have been throwing yourself into a woodchipper to spite your face."
Birmingham,37qr6i,mixduptransistor,7,Fri May 29 17:52:21 2015 UTC,Twinkle Cavanaugh should be in a jail cell.
Birmingham,37qr6i,DriveByBBQ,2,Fri May 29 17:57:19 2015 UTC,What would Twinkle's power have been in this situation? I know her commission is supposed to make sure rates are fair on utilities and whatnot but instead she gives AL Power carte blanche to do what they want.   I'm just not sure what the PSC would do with ridesharing.
Birmingham,37qr6i,willco17,-2,Fri May 29 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"The bill would have moved power to regulate it to the PSC, which means her hand would have been out, Uber would've paid, and they would get whatever they want.  I want common sense regulation. I don't want Uber to be able to buy it's way out of having to comply with every single law."
Birmingham,37qr6i,mixduptransistor,5,Fri May 29 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"I just read the bill. The PSC would be responsible for issuing permits and collecting the $5,000 fee and for ""promulgating rules consistent with this act"", which I assume means making the rules under which permits are issued.   The bill itself defined what a Transportation Network Company is and says that a permit is to be issued to whomever meets those requirements and pays the $5,000. The bill only mentions the PSC in relation to the permits.   So...was Uber (a company currently seeking a $50 billion valuation) going to bribe some politician in Alabama to avoid paying for a $5,000 permit? Maybe I'm naive but I just don't see it."
Birmingham,37qr6i,willco17,-1,Fri May 29 21:28:19 2015 UTC,"""promulgating rules consistent with this act"" = regulating that business  my family has been in politics for a long time. everything involves getting paid in some form or fashion."
Birmingham,37qr6i,mixduptransistor,4,Fri May 29 21:30:44 2015 UTC,"Fair enough but it reads as if the rules they're to promulgate only relate to the issuance of the permit and collection of the fee.   The PSC can't just create extra regulations that aren't in the bill and Uber doesn't have to pay any taxes on top of the permit fee, so I'm not seeing where there's a lot of room for corruption here."
Birmingham,37qr6i,willco17,5,Fri May 29 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"BTW, here's how you fix this problem: get someone to run against Rafferty who can beat her. Run against her. Don't vote for her. Don't live in Birmingham? Advocate to your local representatives for regional governance and cooperation. Fix the root cause instead of just doing the Alabama thing of making a shitty law that patches one specific pain in the ass that you have."
Birmingham,37qr6i,mixduptransistor,6,Fri May 29 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"Btw, you're preaching to the choir."
Birmingham,37qr6i,1886flavor,3,Fri May 29 19:03:42 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. There's a huge pro-Uber-at-any-cost contingent around here.
Birmingham,37qr6i,mixduptransistor,5,Fri May 29 19:11:16 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I'm not ""pro-Uber-at-any-cost"".  I'm just pro-ridesharing-at-THIS-cost.  Also, I looked at the election cycle for the BHM City Council.  Is it not strange that they serve non-staggered terms?"
Birmingham,37qr6i,1886flavor,3,Fri May 29 20:43:32 2015 UTC,And I assume most know ole Rafferty is the barrier.  (I could be wrong)
Birmingham,37qr6i,MichaelTunnell,2,Fri May 29 20:51:52 2015 UTC,"yea and that is disappointing, especially considering how trash Uber is."
Birmingham,37qr6i,NJWhiskeyHunter,4,Fri May 29 19:29:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, and it's a good thing the taxi business model doesn't fleece drivers while making fleet owners rich, all with the full knowledge and support of the cities in which it happens.  Oh, wait, it fucking does.  http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/specials/taxi"
Birmingham,37qr6i,MichaelTunnell,-1,Fri May 29 20:33:33 2015 UTC,"that is not why they are trash, there is a lot more."
Birmingham,37qr6i,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Fri May 29 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"Sure...  There are some people at Uber that do dumb shit.  Newsflash:  There are some people at most companies that do dumb shit.  Doesn't mean the idea is a bad one.  Of course the anti-ridesharing folks don't seem to care how many drunk drives it could prevent, or how it could give our out of town visitors a better experience, or how it could let some folks make a little extra part time cash.  Instead, they are focused on one company in the space doing dumb shit.  Seriously.  WTF yo?"
Birmingham,37qr6i,MichaelTunnell,-3,Fri May 29 21:26:15 2015 UTC,Uber's CEO is one of them.  I also said Lyft = thumbs up so yea your anti-anti-ridesharing has blinded you to assume anyone who doesnt like Uber is automatically anti-ridesharing and that is certainly not the case.
Birmingham,37qr6i,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Fri May 29 21:38:31 2015 UTC,"Call it like I see it dude.  Any time anybody brings up the idea of accommodating ridesharing at any level of government, the anti-uber patrol trots out the bad behavior of one company as an example of why we shouldn't do it.    You folks (and your cheerleader in the city council, hi Kim!) have successfully drowned this baby in the bathwater.  Well done!"
Birmingham,37qr6i,MichaelTunnell,-2,Fri May 29 21:41:45 2015 UTC,You are obviously not seeing very well dude and need corrective lenses. I said I was for ridesharing. I suppose your tunnel vision makes it hard for you to realize there is more than just two sides to this.
Birmingham,37qr6i,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Fri May 29 22:09:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, our taxis are SO much more ethical.  If you don't get into a fight with the driver and he fucking shoots you, that is.  http://www.abc3340.com/story/20410918/police-make-arrest-in-december-8-homicide"

Birmingham,37pj1m,bizzaro333,4,Fri May 29 14:43:43 2015 UTC,I went last week for my birthday. Think I'll go again with some friends.
Birmingham,37pj1m,Nordoisthebest,1 point,Fri May 29 15:59:15 2015 UTC,I thought they were only doing it once...is this a weekly thing now?
Birmingham,37pj1m,MichaelTunnell,4,Fri May 29 16:27:26 2015 UTC,"It's not a weekly thing. Our primary focus is live music, more specifically nationally touring bands. It makes it hard to have consistent week night non music events. Right now we are just kinda having it when we can. Same thing with the trivia night that's starting up. They won't be consistent events in the sense that they happen weekly, but instead things we try to do once a month or so when there's a gap in the calendar. I want to find the balance of building these great events people come out to, but while also considering that when we would have this once a week at Bottletree, the crowds were noticeably thinner. I try to post events on reddit when I can, but I'm also weary of coming off as spammy! It's a fine line between getting the word out and bombarding people."
Birmingham,37pj1m,SaturnBirmingham,0,Sun May 31 06:17:58 2015 UTC,Once a month is actually much better than once a week because it makes it less interesting to do it more often.  The problem I had was that none of this is on the website for the event and since I saw this event listed a few weeks ago for a different date and seeing it now was confusing.  The event just needs a message saying this is a recurring thing and also that it is monthly or whatever.  One event listing for it until October is not a good idea because ti makes it too confusing.
Birmingham,37pj1m,MichaelTunnell,0,Sun May 31 15:46:31 2015 UTC,All the time apparently
Birmingham,37pj1m,Nordoisthebest,-3,Fri May 29 16:34:08 2015 UTC,"wtf, their website is so confusing. I can only find it listed once on their events page which extends all the way to October. The page for the games night lists nothing for it being a repeated event.  They need to fix their marketing because this is rather crap."
Birmingham,37pj1m,MichaelTunnell,0,Fri May 29 16:40:37 2015 UTC,I think it's every Tuesday. But that may be tentative because they just opened.
Birmingham,37pj1m,Nordoisthebest,-3,Fri May 29 17:16:36 2015 UTC,they should totally say that somewhere is all I'm saying. That way people could plan for it better unlike their useless one event listing. :)  Thanks for the info.

Birmingham,37pj1m,skarulid,5,Fri May 29 16:42:53 2015 UTC,"To socialize with people who also enjoy Classic games?   Carting arcade cabs in and out of Saturn isn't really feasible and having them on site wouldn't really fit their decor.  Also they used to do this at bottletree, it's prolly gonna be a lot of the same people, and if that's the case it's going to be a lot of fun."
Birmingham,37pj1m,Eriiiii,-1,Fri May 29 15:00:49 2015 UTC,Like I said in a previous reply who hosts it is it all on good condition or sticky with beer?
Birmingham,37pj1m,skarulid,1 point,Fri May 29 16:41:49 2015 UTC,Because you don't already have over 35 vintage game systems.  Because you don't have a projection sized screen with tournaments or hundreds of people with a similar interest to play them with you. Because its fun to get out of your mom's basement every once and awhile to socialize and have fun.
Birmingham,37pj1m,sknolii,-5,Fri May 29 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"I have 9 and that should be enough, not to mention it's all about the games Who cares if you have an nes if the only game you got is golf. retro games over digital projection looks awful. Sorry for throwing shade but in my experience these types of events are less about retro game fandom and more about selling drinks. I'd rather be at the stillwater or paramount where I can enjoy practically immaculate pinball machines in peace."
Birmingham,37pj1m,skarulid,1 point,Fri May 29 16:37:06 2015 UTC,It's also about socializing with people who share common interests.
Birmingham,37pj1m,skarulid,-5,Fri May 29 16:26:40 2015 UTC,Who's games are they? Who takes care of them. I don't think the bar staff would give a fuck so the controllers would get all sticky.

Before I can give you an answer, I need to know a few more things:   How old are you? Do you have a job? What is your education level? Have you ever been arrested before?  If so, I need to know what for. Did the officers give you a field sobriety test? Did the officers get you to blow into the Draeger machine? Were you a dick to the police officers?   obviously you can feel free to PM me this info."

YO seals your record and allows you to answer ""No"" to future questions about whether you have been arrested or not (job application for example).   Deferred prosecution means that if you do what I say, which usually means go to certain classes (alcohol in this instance) and pay court costs, then I drop the charges. However, the arrest remains on your record, but it shows ""Dismissed"" or ""Dismissed upon conditions.""  I have a wide range of classes.

Birmingham,37l046,MadisonU,3,Thu May 28 14:53:59 2015 UTC,"NOT LEGAL ADVICE JUST THINKING OUT LOUD  A PI is a violation. Not even a misdemeanor. You didn't say where this happened or anything but let's assume it happened in Jeff. Co. for argument's sake. You'd go to District Court and the judge will say can you afford a lawyer or do we need to appoint you one. You can be sentenced to up to 30 days so they have to appoint you one if you qualify as indigent. (Are you going to jail? Doubtful)  Once you have a lawyer the prosecutor will give you exculpatory material or colloquially discovery. That's what the police were talking about. They have to give you anything beneficial to you related to guilt or punishment. Basically you'll get the police report and if there's a video then that. You don't subpoena it, they just give it to you once requested.  If it's in Jeff. Co. they will offer you, likely, community service and dismiss it assuming it's your first and you don't have a crazy criminal history and didn't fight the cops. Since you're only charged with PI (from your post) I don't think you have an issue.  Just my two cents. Take it for what it's worth.  Like /u/derpderpdonkeypunch said if your concern is keeping your criminal record immaculate then bite the bullet and get a lawyer.

Birmingham,37gpu6,merely_mere,2,Wed May 27 20:08:17 2015 UTC,Try contacting the YMCA of Birmingham and other places and see if they have any openings. Do you have any certifications? The only person I know who has had a BS in kinesiology went on to physical therapy assistant school.
Birmingham,37gpu6,doc_timmy,1 point,Wed May 27 15:04:33 2015 UTC,It only takes 2 years for pta school or 3.5 for a doctorate of pt.   I wanted to work at the VA as a physical therapist but can't handle more school.   I'm certified in group exercise and studying for my personal training one next week only because I need continuing education credits for group ex cert.   I do not wanna do that.   I have over 40k in debt and training isn't gonna put a dent in that.   Thanks for the suggestion!!!

Birmingham,37gpu6,doc_timmy,1 point,Wed May 27 16:02:04 2015 UTC,When I was doing my internship at a physical therapy office there was a pta doing his also.   Nice guy but he failed.   If I was gonna do more school I'd have gone all the way.   If I knew about pta school I'd have done that and saved myself 2 years.   It's a good job

I know how it works - and it's not about effort. It's about decisions - you made a conscious decision to research my posts, see what you could find, and then attempt (and fail) to call me out. That's time that could be better spent promoting events in proper places and with enough time to ensure that you'll maximize attendance. But I suppose it was more important for you to look at my posts and try and pick on me. No wonder no one knows much about the con you're helping promote - you're priorities are all kinds of fucked up.   There is no error. You posted about an event after it happened at what point was anything I said not true?   And I called you out for posting about an event that was up and coming for which you were trying to notify people about.

I wasn't affiliated with, associated with, or even friends with anyone that had anything to do with that.   See? That's asking for feedback about something that has already happened. That's not advising people of an event that is coming up.  See the difference? One is pre- the other is post-. What's not true is your criticism. I criticized you for being late to the sub promoting an event that has not yet happened (same with the 3-day notice on the run - not you.) You criticized me because...what? I don't follow where your citation has any relevance or merit.  ""Hey! Come to this thing!"" is not the same as ""Hey! How was that thing that already happened?""   So you just said ""less than a week is last minute"" and then you point out how you were being a tool back then for it a promotion that was ""a few weeks"" in advance. You should make up your mind because right now it seems like you would be pissed about anything posted at any time.   Dense. And thanks for calling me a tool. You seem like a 20-something with little experience or intelligence, so I'll just chalk your failures up to that and move forward.  Conventions involve planning for time off, hotel accommodations, travel expenses, costume creation, and much more. It's not something that most people just do last minute. DragonCon, for example, sees it's host hotels booked full as soon as they're available. Westin up to a year out, Sheraton as well, Hyatt, Mariott, and Hilton 9-11 months out. Memberships are purchased up to a year out. Promotion occurs via TV stations, radio stations, social media, and on-site promotion at other events...usually more than 6 months out.   I have no idea what you are talking about. I've never had a convention.   [But you submitted this post?][(http://www.reddit.com/r/Birmingham/comments/371ikl/magic_city_convention_on_july_2426th_2015_at_the/) By extension, I associated you with the convention in some capacity.

You think way too highly of yourself, but it is the internet so that makes sense. I had no idea I had ever commented to you before or that you commented to me. I guess that is your goal, to get people to remember conversations with you. Alright, success on your part it seems.   I know how it works - and it's not about effort. It's about decisions - you made a conscious decision to research my posts, see what you could find, and then attempt (and fail) to call me out.    You said something along the lines ""I would have done this differently"" so I was curious if you had ever done it differently like you so brasingly claimed you would. Either way, me using Reddit for how it was designed to be is not at all stalking like you said. lol   Conventions involve planning for time off, hotel accommodations, travel expenses, costume creation, and much more. It's not something that most people just do last minute.   What is your point? I have absolutely nothing to do with that convention and will likely not even go. You are blaming me for finding stuff too late, why dont you look for stuff yourself rather than relying on a subreddit to inform you of things?   By extension, I associated you with the convention in some capacity. What capacity is up to you and none of my concern.    That is your fault for making the assumption, not me for sharing information. This is an example of you not paying attention.   So why make the second post?   The original post was about a pre-event a few days ago about promoting the convention. The first post OP did not provide any links or information about the convention itself. I found the links and shared them for everyone to learn more as it was the first I had heard of it and others might want to know more about it as well. In fact, I even made a comment acknowledging the original post OP for letting me know about the convention. (of course you didn't pay attention to that)   Which you do a lot.   I share a lot of stuff indeed, do you think I am connected in some way to everything I post?   the point of your post about the con was ""timeliness"". ""Splat! Here's a thing""   You don't understand the point of the post. I shared it because the first mention of it had no information about it and was only talking about it in passing. I shared it as a full post as to give the actual information with the link to find more. - [original]  I shared it because the original share was not a good share, and instead of insulting the OP personally I decided to help the subreddit with sharing a more detailed post. (another example of you not paying attention)   But you own it (the post.) So, it drew you some heat.   None of the comments were related to me, it was making fun of the brokenness of the website and stuff like that. The heat is completely irrelevant to me. (again not paying attention)   Then you used it as a platform to critique the very website you shared. Hooray.    I didn't use it to critique a website, someone else made fun of it and I agreed that yes the website does look like crap because it does. It also has a LOT of broken aspects like the Sponsors page lists no sponsors and only displays gibberish. If I had started the convo about the website, WHO CARES? I have nothing to do with the convention or the website and I have the right to comment on something regardless if I post it or not. So what is your point?  The trend here is that you don't pay attention very well."

Birmingham,37dl26,poisedforflight,1 point,Wed May 27 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"Historically, academic study of social inequality focused mainly on the ways in which minority groups were discriminated against, and ignored the privileges accorded to dominant social groups. That changed in the late 1980s, when researchers began studying the concept of privilege.[9]  Privilege, as understood and described by researchers, is a function of multiple variables of varying importance, such as race, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, citizenship, religion, physical ability, health, level of education, and others. Race, gender and social class are generally felt by sociologists to be the most determinative of a person's overall level of privilege.[10] Privilege theory argues that each individual is embedded in a matrix of categories and contexts, and will be in some ways privileged and other ways disadvantaged, with privileged attributes lessening disadvantage and membership in a disadvantaged group lessening the benefits of privilege.[11] For example a white lesbian university professor benefits from racial and educational privilege, but is disadvantaged due to her gender and sexual orientation.[12] Some attributes of privilege are ordinarily fairly visible, such as race and gender, and others, such as citizenship status and birth order, are not. Some such as social class are relatively stable and others, such as age, wealth, religion and attractiveness, will or may change over time.[13] Some attributes of privilege are at least partly determined by the individual, such as level of education, whereas others such as race or class background are entirely involuntary.  In the context of the theory, privileged people are considered to be ""the norm"", and, as such, gain invisibility and ease in society, with others being cast as inferior variants.[12] Privileged people see themselves reflected throughout society both in mass media and face-to-face in their encounters with teachers, workplace managers and other authorities, which researchers argue leads to a sense of entitlement and the assumption that the privileged person will succeed in life, as well as protecting the privileged person from worry that they may face discrimination from people in positions of authority.[14] Awareness of privilege  Some academics highlight a pattern where those who benefit from a type of privilege are unwilling to acknowledge it.[2][11][15] American sociologist Michael S. Kimmel describes the state of having privilege as being ""like running with the wind at your back,"" unaware of invisible sustenance, support and propulsion.[2] The argument may follow that such a denial constitutes a further injustice against those who do not benefit from the same form of privilege. One writer has referred to such denial as a form of ""microaggression"" or microinvalidation that negates the experiences of people who don't have privilege and minimizes the impediments they face.[16]  McIntosh wrote that most people are reluctant to acknowledge their privilege and instead look for ways to justify or minimize privilege's effects, sometimes by maintaining that the power of privileged people was fully earned and is therefore justified, and sometimes by acknowledging individual acts of unearned dominance but denying that privilege is institutionalized and embedded throughout society. She wrote that those who believe privilege is systemic may nonetheless deny having personally benefited from it, and may oppose efforts to dismantle it.[2] Part of the reason privileged people resist acknowledging their privilege, researchers say, is because doing so would require them to acknowledge that whatever success they have achieved did not result solely through their own efforts, but was at least partly due to a system that has developed to support them.[16] The concept of privilege calls into question the idea that society is a meritocracy, which researchers have argued is particularly unsettling for Americans for whom belief that they live in a meritocracy is a deeply held cultural value, and one that researchers commonly characterize as a myth.[12][17][18][19][20][21][22]  Kimmel wrote that when people with privilege don't feel personally powerful, arguments that they have benefited from unearned advantages seem unpersuasive.[18]  In 2014, Princeton freshman Tal Fortgang wrote Checking My Privilege, an article in which he condemned classmates who told him to ""check his privilege"" for attributing his success in life to ""some invisible patron saint of white maleness,"" and ""for casting the equal protection clause, indeed the very idea of a meritocracy, as a myth,""[23] and which was afterwards widely debated. McIntosh afterwards told the New Yorker that Fortgang was resisting seeing himself systematically, and argued that everybody has a combination of unearned advantage and unearned disadvantage, and should aim to try to see themselves in the context of societal patterns of discrimination and oppression.[24]"

You're just a arm-chair, angry slacktivist who likes to copy+pasta things devoid of sourcing or context.

Birmingham,37dl26,poisedforflight,0,Wed May 27 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"It's happened all over America.  Why is Birmingham different in this regard?  It seems that you're advocating a lack of personal responsibility while stating that people are incapable of doing anything they put their minds to.  I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt in those areas and think that all it takes is a willingness to band together and work hard to overcome obstacles.  Making excuses certainly doesn't get anything accomplished.  As to privilege, I can't speak to it as I've never had any.  I was born to a lower middle class family that only had one steady income for the majority of my teenage years.  I have held a job since I was 13 years old so that I could buy things like clothes, a car, cell phone, etc. when I wanted them.  I've lost all of my savings twice in my adult life, once when a company I worked for quit paying our insurance right before I had back surgery and I had to pay for it all out of pocket while unemployed due to the company closing shop.  The second time was when my wife and I both lost our jobs due to Hurricane Katrina destroying them.  I didn't make any excuses either time, I did what I had to do."

Why shoud poor communities have to work harder for the bare necessities that the rest of us take for granted? Is it really that unresonable to expect grocery store chains to be available to everyone?

Birmingham,378mwf,HeyitsKierston,10,Mon May 25 19:45:46 2015 UTC,Huge fire in southside - entire apartment complex gone. I believe it is on 17th avenue south. Saw the flames as I pulled in to my apartment on 13th. Can smell plastic burning and ash raining down now. Have some friends that live closer that walked down and told me what was actually burning. Hopefully everyone got out alright.
Birmingham,378mwf,Milk-EyedMender,9,Mon May 25 20:01:52 2015 UTC,"I lived here less than a year ago. My best friend still lives there. She and her family lost everything. Said the fire department took half an hour to get there. Some asshole upstairs caused it and the smoke alarms in his place didn't work. He didn't bother warning anyone. No knocking on doors, nothing. My friend realized what was happening because she went outside to see who was running up and down the stairs and saw all the smoke."
Birmingham,378mwf,samosa4me,2,Tue May 26 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"I hated to see this happen, and am sad your friend and her family have lost so much. Do you know if there is anything in particular they're needing, beyond food/clothing?  The fire seemed to grow so quickly, I'm just glad they're all safe. I don't know how long it took the fire department to arrive, but when I stepped outside after hearing them arrive it was already clear the building couldn't be saved.  I've lived a couple of doors down from that building for a few years now. During the event, I was thinking that the firemen were doing a great job, especially considering the difficulty of the location. It's on a steep hill. The roadways are not ideal for maneuvering a massive fire engine/ambulance (narrow roads, cars parked on both sides). Lots of the gear they used was carried one block up hill."
Birmingham,378mwf,dontfup,4,Tue May 26 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"Chalet is right in my eyeline when I come home on 13th. I parked at 2:20 from picking up some food, no smoke or other signs of emergency, went inside and ate, heard the sirens at about 2:35 and ran outside, saw the one unit totally in flames. Within the span of 2 or 3 minutes it had spread to the neighboring units and had almost spread the whole way by the time the water was flowing. It was fast and intense and I know some of the early reports said it started earlier because no one thought it could have spread that quickly. Obviously I can't speak for someone who was actually in it, but some of the residents told me the guy whose unit went first was actually pounding on doors (possibly just ones along his way to safety) as he made his way out, got a cat out of someone else's apartment, etc. As far as I've gathered, it was an accident - an awful and terrible accident - and it was an extreme stroke of luck that got everyone out and a great deal of effort by the fire department and Red Cross to take care of everything as well as they could given the situation."

Birmingham,375e4x,Nordoisthebest,1 point,Mon May 25 01:20:35 2015 UTC,$1400 coca cola collection. $600 mini chopper needs a new carb but is running fine just leaks. $400 handmade bench $350 Xbox 360 large amount of games $150 paintball guns with masks 3 tanks and two muzzles.
Birmingham,375e4x,mixduptransistor,5,Mon May 25 02:47:11 2015 UTC,it sounds like you are overestimating what you have to trade.  I would sell that stuff for cash you can use to buy a bike.

I work at the World of Coke in Atlanta and I'm in Birmingham for the summer. I'm really into Buying and trading Vintage Coca Cola items.

Birmingham,3745jg,poisedforflight,3,Sun May 24 18:34:06 2015 UTC,Trulia has a crime risk overlay map and reports the location of recent crimes. It's helpful when making sure you aren't moving into the ghetto.

Birmingham,3745jg,HealerWarrior,4,Sun May 24 19:18:16 2015 UTC,I'm certainly not intending for this to be another crime propaganda thread.  I'm just trying to see if anyone is providing the tools to get an accurate understanding of where the problems are in highest concentration and where perception might be off on other areas.
Birmingham,3745jg,mixduptransistor,-5,Sun May 24 19:23:25 2015 UTC,do you really need a map to tell you what areas of the metro area have the highest crime?  I'll give you two hints: North and West.  /thread
Birmingham,3745jg,mckulty,4,Sun May 24 19:29:33 2015 UTC,I am not sure if you looked at the two links I provided but you can drill down to individual blocks and you can also sort the data to look for trends in it.  When doing a deep analysis the type cursory view of things you suggest doesn't help too much.  Why would you feel the need to end the thread on a topic about what could be a valuable asset to a lot of different people?
Birmingham,3745jg,tstap11,3,Sun May 24 20:07:32 2015 UTC,A map like that would require metro area governments to cooperate. Not too much of a chance of that happening.
Birmingham,373l76,rtrntocookiemountain,9,Sun May 24 15:38:49 2015 UTC,Beer?  J Clyde is a good bet.    Cocktails?  Hit Collins Bar.
Birmingham,373l76,NJWhiskeyHunter,5,Sun May 24 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"J Clyde or one of the breweries in town would be great for a beer.  Mixed drinks I don't know as well personally but paramount downtown has old school arcade games is kinda cool.    Live music is defiantly a thing to do around here.  Depending on the night there could be a good show at any number of venues but depending on your taste- Saturn, iron city, and workplay often have good shows any night of the week.    Birmingham is an awesome foodie town with lots of great places in various cost levels.  Zagat gave bham a nod as up and coming this year.    If your a motor head then the the ultimate nascar track is only about 45 mins down the interstate from Leeds and if you haven't seen Dega it is a monument to speed that is worth seeing.    A recent addition that is cool is Escape Birmingham as a nighttime amusement.  They lock you in a puzzle room that you have an hour to solve and it's pretty cool if that's your cup of tea.   Sorry I'm on mobile so links would be a lot of extra work but Google Fu will find you all you need."

Dave's pretty frequently has live music (Mandi Rae played last friday night, and she kicks ass) and does kareoke on thursday nights starting at 10pm, and they usually wind up packed out with a crowd that's younger than I am (but would be in your age group.)

There's a Facebook group for /r/Birmingham, we have impromptu meetups through it and talk about junk.  Me and my friends are weird and childish and more than willing to hang out with a new person. The group is mostly woman in their 20's, though I'm a dude.  There's also events all around the city that are good ways to meet new people like the upcoming Brewfest and Sidewalk film fest. The best way to do it is volunteer one day and get the other days free. Plus working with people is how I've met loads of fun people.  If you like bike riding there's a really fun and some-what slow paced trample done by Redemptive cycles.  If you like beer and meat I suggest trying out Bottle and Bone.   Hope I was of some help."

Birmingham,371ikl,FalconHunter,1 point,Tue May 26 15:57:09 2015 UTC,"DragonCon's website has never looked as bad as this.   This website has next to nothing about the convention and it looks like it was written by a PR person with nearly zero demo research.  I'm all for more local cons but everything about this event screams inexperience, lack of research, and poor market targeting.   I'll attend and see what happens, but I have very, very low expectations.   Also - it's poor form to justify one mistake by citing a mistake made by someone else. (Well, THEY did it, sooooo....)

Was it a dated design? Sure, but at the time it worked well, so why change it? Perhaps it's nostalgia, but I rather liked that layout because I knew where to look for everything and it was easy to read and navigate.    It's poor to misinterprit someone's words as ""justification"" rather than acknowledgement that most con sites are awful   So we're trying to promote a new con, but we're making excuses for why the first impressions shouldn't be valid - aka, godawful website design and execution devoid of useful information - but it's okay because, subjectively, you didn't like DragonCon's former layout...a layout that worked pretty well for years and had enough information to adequately inform and educate attendees about the convention.

Birmingham,36zmfd,CarrieBHS,2,Sat May 23 16:04:47 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know.  I've just been there a week now.  I do know that there are some stunning older homes that are just crying out to be fixed up.

My friend lives in a historic part of Eastlake. Her house is worth 150k. She has had her house and car broken into. One of my other friends lives two blocks south. His house is worth 30k. He hasn't dealt with any break-ins yet, but people dump trash in his back alley. Eastlake has a plethora of used tire stores, barbershops and wing shops. The neighborhood also has  a Rally's, Krispy Kreme, motorcycle club and Lil' Caesars. If you plan on upgrading your wardrobe, you can stop by Douka Fashion and pick up a linen Steve Harvey suit or fake Fubu. Eastlake isn't ready for you yet."

Birmingham,36zmfd,dreed18,3,Sat May 23 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the movement is facing a huge uphill battle. A lot of the work is set to begin in the next year or so. The time to really fight this was 3-4 years ago, but most of the downtown's attention was on Railroad Park and whether it would work. Most people weren't paying attention to the 20/59 plan. Even myself, I thought the plan was stupid but never knew if there was organized resistance to it."
Birmingham,36zmfd,caldwellesq,4,Sun May 24 00:29:20 2015 UTC,That's a shame.  The Interstate plan of the 1950's and 1960's did a lot of damage to cities across America.  It's a shame that there is not a more proactive approach to rectifying some of the situations it created.

Birmingham,36zmfd,AlBundysFriendGriff,4,Sat May 23 22:33:22 2015 UTC,"Of the neighborhoods listed, definitely East Lake. That being said, there's still tons of room for rehabilitation/improvement in avondale, crestwood, southside/glen iris, downtown, and even highland park. The bulk of improvements will happen in these neighborhoods for a pretty good while. There's still just too many affordable apartments, condos, and homes in these places to force a large number of young professionals to move to east lake or elsewhere."

Birmingham,36zmfd,CancerX,2,Sat May 23 18:12:47 2015 UTC,Another area to consider is the area of downtown around the up-coming Jefferson Tower project (West of 18th St). It is not as colonized as the rest of downtown yet and there are some commercial building that could be converted to killer residential space. Idk about pricing or if you're up for that level of project.
Birmingham,36zmfd,SNOTcorn,3,Sun May 24 17:10:08 2015 UTC,Thank you.  That's not an area I'd heard or read about at all.  That might be a little above what I'm looking to do but I will certainly look into it.  Personally I'd rather live in a huge loft space but the wife likes patios and fire pits plus roaming space for the dogs.
Birmingham,36zmfd,dreed18,2,Sun May 24 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"Woodlawn is probably your best bet. With the presence of the Woodlawn Foundation and the projects they're pushing along with the Church of the Highlands having a hub there, Woodlawn will be the new Avondale in 5-10 years. They still need to address the drug and prostitution problem they have. If you do move to Birmingham, you should just rent a house in Hoover and visit the areas you are considering to weigh out the risks."
Birmingham,36zmfd,Zaphod1620,2,Sun May 24 21:52:40 2015 UTC,Thanks.  We'll probably rent somewhere closer to the city center but do plan on going that route.  I don't really have a need to commute that far and it's a big part of why we're moving.  I want to be within 10-15 minutes work to home including traffic.
Birmingham,36y4bw,MichaelTunnell,12,Sat May 23 02:19:49 2015 UTC,"The only way UAB will have football again is if somebody offers enough money directly to Paul Jr to make it happen. Most of the Alabama board of trustees also get a check from Bryant bank. That means they get a check from Paul Jr. himself.   At the end of the day, Paul Jr. is the BoT, and nothing will change that because Machine members run everything in this state."
Birmingham,36y4bw,barrett51bmg,9,Sat May 23 03:52:23 2015 UTC,I would love to have a good legal opinion on whether UAB had a case in court for complete or semi-autonomy.  They need to do what most other states do and have an overall system board with each institution having both it's own board and equal representation on the overall system board.

Birmingham,36y4bw,poisedforflight,4,Sat May 23 13:36:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this makes the situation better or worse.  This went from reinstating football to reinstating football AND spending $60M+ on a new stadium.  Having only kept up with this from the periphery I do remember some talk in the past that UAB had some funding arranged for such a stadium but don't remember the details.  I think it would be a great idea.  Build a large enough stadium for UAB, MLS, and the bowl game somewhere else and turn the legion field area into a park with a lake or something similar.  Maybe turn it into mixed use development with strong codes to help shape positive growth.    The proposed location for the new stadium was about as perfect as it could be.  You wouldn't have to disturb any buildings of a historic nature or established neighborhoods.  I found this article that says the debt service would be less than $4M a year.  I guess the UAT campus needs that $4M a year too bad to pay off their ill planned scheme to become a Tier 1 university that failed to allow UAB to do something that would be great for both UAB and the City of Birmingham.  www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2011/11/ua_board_of_trustees_stop_uab.html  I've not heard of another similar situation where the future of a company that has $3B a year in revenue is completely controlled by one that does less than $1/2B a year in revenue."
Birmingham,36y4bw,poisedforflight,4,Sat May 23 13:45:43 2015 UTC,"Having only kept up with this from the periphery I do remember some talk in the past that UAB had some funding arranged for such a stadium but don't remember the details.   UAB had naming rights sold and all 25-odd luxury boxes sold, and with the level of ticket sales that UAB was at in 2011 would have been able to pay for it. Attendance last year was up over 100% over those levels. A stadium is absolutely do-able, especially if the city partners with UAB on it."

Birmingham,36y4bw,poisedforflight,2,Sat May 23 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"Well, there's no point in reinstating football if it just restores the status quo. If UAB is going to bring back football, it needs to be done right, and that means real facilities."
Birmingham,36y4bw,vulcans_pants,1 point,Sun May 24 20:21:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Probably take 2 years of playing at Lesion Field to get the new stadium project completed if it were implemented quickly.

Last Bill Clark publicly stated was that he was waiting around in anticipation of UAB Football being reinstated.  He is a great coach and exactly who UAB needs during this time."

I get it, people like football, but most people didn't give a crap about UAB football when it was here and we had access to go so why do people think that will change?  I'd much rather this $22.5 Million pledge fund be spent on the city and all the stuff that is actually necessary."
Birmingham,36y4bw,perseus4,4,Sun May 24 00:05:08 2015 UTC,I think it would have changed because UAB was supposed to be pretty decent next season. Their coach has them on the right track. I 100% was going to purchase season tickets this upcoming season before that crap went down. I was very excited about it. Most of their games would have been at 11am so you get home before any of the bigger games are on.   Now I'm debating whether or not to pick up UAB bball tickets for this season. They will probably be the best team in the state (again) and still young.
Birmingham,36y4bw,perseus4,1 point,Sun May 24 06:19:43 2015 UTC,"That would be great to uses that money for public transportation and school funding, but were is the city going to get the money to maintain the improvements. If the $22.5 Million was used to build a nice new stadium that would be used for football, concerts, and other sporting events, it would bring tax revenue, and jobs to the area. This way the city will have a revenue stream that could then buy and maintain new public projects."

Birmingham,36rdfq,southsam,6,Thu May 21 21:47:41 2015 UTC,Speaking of growler beer there needs to be a PSA on Highland Package's taps. They are never cleaned and they consistently are contaminated or a mix of several beers and yeasts.

Also, I like growlers for beers that I feel are too carbonated.  Getting it into the growler knocks some of the carbonation out of it and makes it a bit more drinkable, IMHO."
Birmingham,36rdfq,sockdologer,1 point,Thu May 21 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"What types are you putting into growlers? IPAs and other pale ale types aren't going to growler well unless you're drinking it very soon afterward.  I've had my best luck with porters, stouts, barleywines, and Belgian styles. Some of these actually benefit from some time spent in the bottom of the fridge, like /u/NJWhiskeyHunter mentioned.  It also matters greatly how well the container was sanitized prior to  the fill, how skilled the tap puller is in filling it, and what care is taken with the lines at the establishment. Infected beer is a bummer.  Saying all of this, if I have the choice between a can/bottle or a growler, I'll probably choose the former. But when packages aren't available, growlers can be awesome when you want to take a bit more of that limited release home with you. I can't wait to be able to do this at the breweries."

Birmingham,36txzc,vulcans_pants,3,Fri May 22 14:18:16 2015 UTC,"My small business uses T-Mobile. We (7 users) have found the service and group rates to be very good. I have good service in downtown, mountain brook, vestavia, and irondale."
Birmingham,36txzc,bizzaro333,2,Fri May 22 15:18:53 2015 UTC,"I have never used anything but T-Mobile, and I've never had any issues whatsoever with it. My husband actually switched from Sprint to T-Mobile because he had no signal in our house."
Birmingham,36txzc,merely_mere,2,Fri May 22 14:29:27 2015 UTC,"I actually moved from Verizon to T-Mobile last year and I have never regretted a single moment of it.  Verizon = Phone Hell  I had a grandfathered in unlimited plan on Verizon before I left so I heard a lot of people asking me ""why would you throw that away"". Here is why . . .   I was paying $240 per month for 3 lines and 3 very old phones, one was terrible and two were great but 3 years since release and just couldn't cut it anymore with new versions of Android.  I tried to upgrade my phone on Verizon but they said that I was not eligible with my contract and that if I wanted to upgrade I would have to voluntarily lose my Unlimited Plan so I had two options, (1.) pay full price for 3 new phones or (2.) lose my unlimited plan for a cheaper upgrade of $200 (per phone, so $600)  By the way, I didn't have unlimited calls or unlimited texts, we were ""family sharing"" those on 3 phones.    I chose option 3, leave Verizon and save myself from insanity.  I chose T-Mobile because they had recently launched the Un-Carrier campaign like a month before so it was great timing for me.  Here is what I have now:   $260 per month (I know doesn't seem like an upgrade right now but hold on) 5 New Smartphones, all Nexus 5s. Yes I upgraded 3 phones and added 2 more. I have insurance on all of these phones at $10 per month. I pay for the phones monthly so I don't have to worry about being overcharged for the phones, I know exactly how much it will cost me for each phone. I now have Unlimited Talk and Text I have Unlimited Data but it gets throttled after 3 GBs but this is per phone not some stupid family share data crap.   So I am technically paying $20 per month more BUT for that extra $20 I upgrade all 3 phones to BADASS Nexus 5s, added 2 more Nexus 5s, Insurance on All Phones, Unlimited Talk & Text, Unlimited Data with 3GB of Unthrottled Data and when I am done paying for the phones I own the phones.  ~$260 / 5 lines = ~$52 per line for a great service plan, badass phone and insurance on the phone.  I actually pay $15 per month for each phone in an installment plan type thing so when I am done paying for the phone, I am done paying for the phone. The other carriers will just steal as much money from you as possible so you could actually pay twice as much money than the phone is even worth. Once my phones are paid in full, my bill will become $75 cheaper.  Can you think of a single other carrier that will actually discount your plan at all for any reason?"
Birmingham,36txzc,vulcans_pants,1 point,Fri May 22 15:51:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed reply. You pretty much summed up all the reasons I want to switch over as well.   How was the process of switching over phone numbers?
Birmingham,36txzc,merely_mere,2,Fri May 22 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"When we switched my husband over, the T-Mobile rep called Sprint and got the correct department on the phone, then put my husband on the phone-- they got his permission for the switch, and it was almost instantaneous."
Birmingham,36txzc,mixduptransistor,1 point,Fri May 22 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"The switching phone numbers was just fine, there is an order to it though that you MUST do.  DO NOT cancel your Verizon account first!   Signup for T-Mobile before you cancel your account. T-Mobile will port the number for you. if you cancel your account, Verizon will also cancel your number and you will lose it."
Birmingham,36txzc,derpderpdonkeypunch,2,Sat May 23 01:46:53 2015 UTC,"Depends. Do you have any family or friends who live further out, or have any other occasion to go further out than say, Alabaster or Gardendale?   T-Mobile is great if you stay in the city and hardly ever go out to the deep suburbs or out in rural areas of the state. However, if you need your phone to work in a county other than Jefferson and Shelby, then it might be rough going. I tried T-Mobile for a while but my folks live out in Montevallo/Calera, and I never got a signal out there.   Verizon may be a little more expensive, but wow the coverage is so much better."
Birmingham,36txzc,Helenite,1 point,Fri May 22 19:08:05 2015 UTC,"I switched from T-Mobile to Verizon a couple years ago and never looked back. I was a T-Mobile customer for about nine years and they have great customer service, but the spotty reception and dead spots in the city, and the large swaths of no coverage at all in more rural areas sealed the deal for me.    There was an occasion a few years ago when I was heading back to Birmingham on hwy 79 where I desperately needed to call 911 and was entirely unable to do so. I was right about at the Jeff Co/Blount Co line and a well travelled highway.  If the other guy had a knife or a gun, I very likely wouldn't be here today.     Now, with Verizon, I have at least three bars of reception arriving past that spot."

Birmingham,36sa12,Nordoisthebest,3,Thu May 21 19:18:43 2015 UTC,That's the problem I've been complaining about. Our group of moderators is too homogeneous. I promise I'm not starting crap but only considering yik-yak and UAB outreach is very narrow in scope.   That's a very narrow subset of the Birmingham population you were even considering reaching out to.   If you want to strategically drive the growth of this sub you need to break the circlejerk mentality and pull in a diverse group of mods from all ages and backgrounds.
Birmingham,36sa12,CancerX,3,Fri May 22 22:55:34 2015 UTC,It is not fixed. We want to add a mod that represents your poll of users but it doesn't matter when modding. We the mods are active members and our opinions are just as valid as yours. The voting system is right.
Birmingham,36sa12,Nordoisthebest,0,Fri May 22 23:31:46 2015 UTC,The thing is you're opinions aren't valid because the entire population of users isn't represented in the mod group. Therefore your conclusions lack external validity. That is to say they can't be generalized to the larger full population that use this subreddit because large demographics of people aren't represented in the very homogeneous sample of moderators.    I'm a data scientist though so I'm always thinking about whether the sample represents the population as a whole. I am just thinking strategically. If your goal is to broaden your username then the mods should have more diversity that reflects the end group of users you want to have as your end user base.   I think we can both agree that the mod group does not currently reflect the end population you want to end up with.
Birmingham,36sa12,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Sat May 23 14:49:10 2015 UTC,"Wait, you work demographics? Like with GIS?

The public housing residents who live there are awful neighbors. The one below me sits out on her balcony smoking weed and cursing.  DO NOT MOVE THERE! The rent goes up drastically after your lease expires.  When you call the voicemail ALWAYS picks up.  Your message is sometimes returned the next day.  The location is ideal, but if you are living by the public housing residents they make it unsafe with their family and friends who come by and sit out all around the stairs blocking your entrance to get into your apartment.  The maintenance staff is unprofessional and does not respond timely.  Even when they come you won't know it because they don't leave a card indicating they have been by OR plan to repair/resolve the issue.  The property manager is never seen because she stays in her office with the door closed.  If she would get out of her office OR open the door she could see-hear the problems that exist with the maintenance staff."

The apartments look horrible and are probably constructed hastily. Not sure what the hope vi project is but I assume it's some forms of government assisted housing because it's pretty hood around there. If you could  talk the leasing office down to about 400~500 utilities included I'd move there in a heartbeat but it's not worth 700~800 as per the website.

Birmingham,36q4n7,Everwinter81,5,Thu May 21 11:31:27 2015 UTC,I think it's a proprietary thing where the officer can't just unplug a USB device and hook it into his computer and delete the video.  Were I representing a defendant and some footage went missing I'd move to suppress his testimony as forfeiture by wrongdoing. It would be great impeachment material. It just so happened that your band new device happened to not record the eight minutes you were with my client? If I were sitting on a jury that would be damning to me. I'm biased I admit that.  Now could the officer ask his buddy in the tech department to delete the video? Sure I guess.
Birmingham,36q4n7,willco17,5,Thu May 21 12:10:39 2015 UTC,I think the point is that the officer has to turn it on. It'd be pretty convenient to forget.

Birmingham,36q4n7,OhNoFiveOh,1 point,Thu May 21 18:05:47 2015 UTC,"Forfeiture by wrongdoing is a legal doctrine that, for example, if John is going to give testimony against me and I kill John then that testimony isn't excluded as hearsay. I killed him thus my wrongdoing makes it admissible.   Let's say officer testifies his camera magically didn't record for the eight minutes of someone's arrest. Defendant and person a and b are there. Person a gives statement at the admin building post Miranda. Person b gives statement on the scene to officer. Person b says something exculpatory person a says something inculpatory.    Normally the state would attempt to exclude person b as hearsay if they aren't available to testify. But for the officer's failure to follow protocol this testimony would be before the judge for, at a minimum, an in camera inspection. Thus the testimony should be admissible through the police report or whatever other ear witness is available through Forfeiture by wrongdoing. The officer's failure makes the testimony probative.    Sans luck."
Birmingham,36q4n7,Everwinter81,2,Fri May 22 05:34:31 2015 UTC,"I understand your argument.  However, you can't prove wrongdoing unless the officer admits, or there is evidence, that he didn't turn on the camera willfully. I can't see where intent would not play a part.   Same way with dash cams. Sometimes there isn't footage from stops. Some of our utility cars aren't equipped with them and sometimes our computers go down on the ones that do have them. However, our cases still go through with fairly high conviction rates."
Birmingham,36q4n7,OhNoFiveOh,-1,Fri May 22 13:00:31 2015 UTC,The officer's subjective intent isn't relevant to a suppression motion. It's an objective standard.   As for dash cams new technology requires new rules. The current political climate is such that police are not trustworthy beyond reproach and it will never be so again. Courts will defer less and less to fallible human testimony and more and more to independent things like cameras.
Birmingham,36q4n7,Everwinter81,2,Fri May 22 13:02:38 2015 UTC,"Regardless, you would still have to prove wrongdoing. A malfunction does not constitute wrongdoing."

We record contacts with citizens on calls, wrecks, traffic stops, etc. From there the video is stored in the camera. At then end of the shift we put the camera on a dock where everything is uploaded to the cloud and stored on Evidence.com (dont bother). From there we can view the videos, but we cannot erase or edit them. Everytime they are viewed we have to complete a chain of custody log with an explanation of why it was watched.

Birmingham,36shy8,Carlajeanwhitley,0,Thu May 21 19:37:20 2015 UTC,"Every single group that truly cares about that university has answered that question, in different ways at different times, with a resounding, ""Yes!""   If only answering the question with a yes actualy put butts in seats.  It's really easy for a few writers in Bham to keep saying this.  It's even easier for a bunch of people to say yes when asked.  It's quite another for anyone to get past their apathy and actually make it a fruitful enterprise.     the UAB administration and UA System board of trustees have never given the sport the support it needed to be successful.   You can't have it both ways.  If freeuab thinks that UA is dragging it down it can't also claim that a simple lack of support is what kept it from being great.  UA can't be both nefarious and absentee, depending on what's convenient for the current argument.  Either UAB football can make it on it's own or it can't.     the Blazers put together their best season in a decade   For a lot of teams breaking even is grounds for getting fired.  The fact that this is trotted out just shows how desperate the argument for uab football is.  If you want to know what a truly great coach can do look at Auburn softball right now.  From ""that exists"" to an SEC championship in one season.  Getting to .500 isn't much of an accomplishment.     and attendance more than doubled   Anyone that ever went to a game knows this isn't' true.  I'm tired of arguing it.  Just because there was a ticket ""bought"" doesn't mean there was a butt in the seat.     That's why UAB football should be restored. This is supposed to be a university   If that's the case than why are people letting UAB's academic rep slide?  After graduating and going to grad school somewhere else... UAB is not being viewed the same as it once was.  It's still a powerhouse in research funding but those numbers are going down.  I've been amazed at the way other professors talk about UAB now.  This football stuff has only made it worse.    It should be very telling that the second response to the article has several citations whereas the first is literally just ""muh feelz.""  I realize that this hurts some people on a personal level, but decisions that affect entire campuses and cities cannot be based on that.  Even if those people keep stamping their feet on the internet."

Nothing was around it except for Parkside being a few blocks away. Now that Avondale is growing, not so much, but unless you'd already been there it's still far away from any of the foot traffic that Avondale seems to thrive on. I'd still call it a destination location, and I don't see people going there for chicken, especially when 41st St is so visible and has so much delicious food already."

Birmingham,36moxu,lilswole,5,Wed May 20 14:44:15 2015 UTC,"ITT, people who like BrightHouse are arguing with people who like AT&T with essentially no reliable answer provided by anyone because everyone's experience is vastly different based on many factors . . .  these factors can include but are not limited to: computer experience, location, knowledge of services, and preference of owning equipment or renting it.  Basically the fundamental answer is, ask someone who already lives in the area you moved into and ask them what they use and how they like it because ultimately everyone is going to have information that likely will not apply to you.  However, if your decision is based solely on one of two factors then there are possible answers for you.   Do you care mostly about the cost? AT&T will give you slower internet while spending less money to get it. If you don't care about the speeds all that much then AT&T will be for you. Do you care mostly about the speeds and power of the connection? BrightHouse will give you a much faster connection but will cost more to get it. If you care more about speed than money then BrightHouse is for you.   If neither of those options match you then ask your neighbors."
Birmingham,36moxu,MichaelTunnell,4,Wed May 20 21:34:16 2015 UTC,"I have BrightHouse, internet only (no TV) and I have my own modem. Cost is ~$50/mo.

Birmingham,36moxu,lakeviewish,3,Wed May 20 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"I've had AT&T for many years and I have never felt it was ""sooo slow"" or even felt like it was being throttled.  That's my experience anyway."
Birmingham,36moxu,Xelliz,2,Wed May 20 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"I'm and IT Network admin who's worked in this area professorially for 10+ years. They throttle all kinds of stuff, they also port block random things they don't think you should be using on U-Verse. I wouldn't give AT&T any of my money."
Birmingham,36moxu,AlverezYari,2,Wed May 20 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate your input, I too work in the IT industry and have spent a number years in Network and System Administration positions.  As I stated before, I have had AT&T for years and have not had any problems with speed or throttling.  I don't think AT&T is some savior of the consumer, nor do I know their internal policies for bandwidth regulation, but my experience with them has been mostly positive."
Birmingham,36moxu,Xelliz,0,Wed May 20 17:50:20 2015 UTC,"Great, glad you've had a good time, but they throttle tons of traffic on that network. Just making sure that people in the market who read your response don't get wrong info is all."
Birmingham,36moxu,AlverezYari,2,Wed May 20 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"If you want people to NOT have wrong info, then maybe you should try posting proof instead of being all uppity about it.  You know, the same way you posted your career to justify your comments without posting proof.  I'm not saying your are wrong or right, but basically you are posting unsupported comments on the internet as fact.  Where as I am simply sharing my experience and that means you are telling me that I did not have the experiences that I have.  Now, if you mean that they have monthly bandwidth caps thats a different issue."
Birmingham,36moxu,Xelliz,1 point,Wed May 20 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"Lol, what do you suppose I should post? I've definitely keep trace, ping, and bandwidth logs from all our customers over the last 10 years just to drop them in a random Reddit pissing contest to prove a point. Where is your proof? I mean what could I be other than another user seemingly thinking he is informed sharing his experiences here? What do you think I'm doing, just sitting around waiting on this post so I can bad mouth AT&T for no reason? FINALLY MY TIME TO SHINE! I HOPE HE DOESN'T ASK FOR PROOF!"
Birmingham,36moxu,AlverezYari,2,Wed May 20 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"You could post whatever you want to back up your assertion...logs, traceroutes, articles, court documents, etc.    If this is a pissing contest then its one only you are participating in.  Its the same as ""I like Ford and you hate Ford because they suck.""  Why do they suck?    Maybe AT&T is throttling a variety of services but just shouting it to the world doesn't get me to join your side in being against AT&T.  See I even took the time to google this and didn't see anything other than a few post suspecting actual throttling and a lot of links talking about bandwidth caps."
Birmingham,36moxu,Xelliz,1 point,Wed May 20 18:41:02 2015 UTC,"I've already answered why they suck, but just so you have it right here.... they have limited port forwarding functionality on their routers, they gate off ports like 25 o they don't think you as as consumer should use, and the throttle sites like: youtube, and twitch.   What else can I get you cupcake?"
Birmingham,36moxu,AlverezYari,2,Wed May 20 18:49:10 2015 UTC,"Wow...name calling, so I guess you'll start crying soon.  Ok, so you say that they limit port forwarding, well then I guess I never tried to forward to the ones that are restricted because I have yet to have issues with this. So you're telling me that AT&T is the only ISP that blocks port 25 so that consumers can't host their own email server?  Surely thats not what you are suggesting, because this has been a common practice world wide for quite some time.  Could you link some articles discussing this throttling of youtube and twitch?  I would legitimately be interested in this because there are topics all over the internet about how to get around ISP throttling youtube, so again this must not be an AT&T only thing."
Birmingham,36moxu,Xelliz,3,Wed May 20 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"Bright House will be more expensive, but also faster.  IIRC U-verse is only 3mbps whereas Bright House has 15 mbps.  If you use lots of internets, BH is probably worth it.  If you like Internet Lite, U-verse will save you the moneys.  I have Charter now and love it, but Bright House was alright, though slightly over-priced.  They made canceling the service very easy and even refunded me for the portion of the month that would be unused.  I believe they did charge me $3 a month for a ""free"" modem, though, so careful there."
Birmingham,36moxu,aMiracleAtJordanHare,2,Wed May 20 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure when you last checked, but UVerse has speeds up to 45mb for pretty much everyone and some places can get the 300mb package.  I'm sure Bright House has speeds a lot faster than 15mb as well."
Birmingham,36moxu,Xelliz,1 point,Wed May 20 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  Yeah I didn't have any direct experience with UVerse, but was always getting mail about ""speeds up to 3mbps!"" at my old apt.  (Fucking lulllz)  I guess other than stories of horrible customer service issues or something, OP should just compare prices and speeds available to them."
Birmingham,36moxu,aMiracleAtJordanHare,1 point,Wed May 20 17:41:58 2015 UTC,Cable like Bright House is not restricted that low either. You need to change your plan.  BrightHouse starts at 15Mbps and maxes out at 150Mbps http://brighthouse.com/shop/internet/internet.html (as claimed by their site)
Birmingham,36moxu,MichaelTunnell,0,Wed May 20 21:12:21 2015 UTC,Up to 75mbps in some areas now.
Birmingham,36moxu,mindshadow,3,Wed May 20 22:09:38 2015 UTC,"I've had both, and Brighthouse was ridiculously unreliable in my experience. It went out pretty much every day. U-Verse has been awesome and steady. (I'm a couple of miles away, but I can't imagine it would be that different? But maybe I'm wrong.)"
Birmingham,36moxu,Carlajeanwhitley,2,Wed May 20 15:46:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend AT&T over Brighthouse here. Their U-verse service has a lot of backend limitations that anyone but the most basic Internet user will probably rub up against at some point. If you don't know what port forwarding is I guess U-Verse is ok.
Birmingham,36moxu,AlverezYari,1 point,Wed May 20 17:44:06 2015 UTC,"I had Bright House internet in The Highlands and it was SUPER spotty and a pain in the ass as you mention.  I have AT&T now and live in Southside. I kinda hate their TV idiocy, but the internet is consistent and strong enough to let me stream around those issues."
Birmingham,36moxu,StumbleBees,2,Wed May 20 21:59:34 2015 UTC,"I have used AT&T, since they were Bellsouth (this was in Mobile) and LOVED them. I moved up here, and got U-Verse, and it was great as well. I never had problems with service, ever.  I moved to a new apartment, and had to get Brighthouse, which I thought I paid too much for what I was getting. They throttle YouTube, and most streaming type sites! I had to pay for a VPN to bypass their throttling as I couldn't even play a YouTube video in its entirety without skipping and buffering issues.  If you have Charter, they have great speed, but the worst support you will EVER speak to. No matter what the issue is, they will send a tech, you will get very, very little phone support."
Birmingham,36moxu,systmdcln13,2,Wed May 20 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"I've very rarely had a Charter tech come to my house actually, it is all usually solved over the phone except when I upgraded my service that required new equipment. They insisted someone come out then.  BrightHouse on the other hand wasted hours of my life refusing to listen to me that they needed to send one. I did everything I possibly could to test every variation of the setup before I even called them to see if it was equipment failure and it wasn't. They put me on hold for 1.5 hours waiting for a response.  BrightHouse finally agreed to send out a tech who solved absolutely nothing, he essentially did some of what I had already done and declared it fine. He was full of crap.  BrightHouse sent out a second tech who did more stuff that I had already done and solved nothing. He declared it fine too and of course it wasn't.  BrightHouse finally sent out someone who wasn't incompetent and he did everything I did and the others did but this one said ""I don't know what is wrong but something certainly is"". So this guy realized there actually was a problem even though he couldn't find it and admitted as such.  BrightHouse sent out the same tech with another tech and finally the problem was found. There was bad wiring in the apartment building itself.  The people on the phone and the first two techs were incompetent and refused to listen to me even though I obviously knew more about their network than they did.  I will avoid BrightHouse as long as I possibly can. My job depends on reliable and reasonably powerful internet connection so a week of no internet is not acceptable to me especially when they claim there isn't a problem.  Disclaimer: this did not happen to me, I was trying to solve a problem for someone else who asked for my help because they were being given the run around by BrightHouse. However, the part of my needs are relevant to me using this service before because refusing to admit there is a problem is unacceptable.  Reference: this happened like 6 months ago."
Birmingham,36moxu,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Wed May 20 21:29:01 2015 UTC,"The only time I ever call Charter, is when my internet is out, or choppy.

I use my own router and my modem is just a dumb access point so the only one with credentials for my router is me. :)"
Birmingham,36moxu,MichaelTunnell,2,Wed May 20 21:42:58 2015 UTC,"I will agree, that when Charter works, it WORKS. It's been quite reliable for me as well, just some initial bumps. It's also a bonus to not need a VPN to bypass throttling, and sometimes I notice my speeds spike to 1Gbps."
Birmingham,36moxu,systmdcln13,2,Wed May 20 21:48:26 2015 UTC,"If you can get Charter, do that. I've never worked with U-verse but currently have Brighthouse (Charter isn't covering my area). It's pricey, but in my experience has been fairly reliable and decent speeds. You can get a 15 mbps connection for $40-45 a month without any cable or phone service, which is not as good as Charter but rarely a problem."
Birmingham,36moxu,sydney_cromwell,2,Wed May 20 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"I've had AT&T internet forever.  When I lived in an apt on 280, we had 1.5mb DSL and never had a single issue that I can recall.  3 People shared this.  When I moved back in with my parents in the sticks, I had to wait a while before DSL was available but I got 1.5mb DSL there as well, which my parents have kept (maybe 3mb now...I forget).  There have been a lot of disconnecting issues but apparently there have all revolved around AT&T overloading the closest junction because thats what ISPs do...not spend money until forced.  Once I moved into my own place, I again got AT&T DSL and eventually moved to UVerse.  My friends have constantly complained about their cable internet being laggy even though they've always paid for 2-3 times the speed I do.  Never have I felt any of the speeds provided by AT&T to be slow or laggy.  Since living in my own place I have had 1.5mb DSL, 3mb DSL, 3mb UVerse, 6mb Uverse and 12mb Uverse.  The only reason I continue to upgrade is because they have either literally paid me to do so in some cases or they keep offering upgrade packages that actually lower my bill.  That being said, I think every ISP in the US charges WAY too much for internet."
Birmingham,36moxu,Xelliz,2,Wed May 20 17:31:47 2015 UTC,Hawhhhh
Birmingham,36moxu,badat_reddit,3,Wed May 20 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"Bright House is more expensive, but you can get faster speeds out of them.  AT&T is cheaper, but their max speeds that you can buy are about half that of Bright House.  I have Bright House and have zero reliability issues. I cannot say anything about U-Verse because they don't offer it to my address."
Birmingham,36moxu,mixduptransistor,1 point,Wed May 20 17:48:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely find out if Charter can provide service there.  $39.99/month and a free modem (you'd want to buy your own wireless router, their wireless gateway is not very good) for 60Mbps down/4Mbps up.  U-verse has been unreliable and too slow for me to really use but I haven't had it in Birmingham.  Bright House is just expensive so I haven't tried it."
Birmingham,36moxu,Vynlovanth,1 point,Wed May 20 16:04:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed, go for Charter if possible."
Birmingham,36moxu,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Wed May 20 21:18:44 2015 UTC,"Aside from the Uverse people accidentally unplugging my connection when working in someone's else's, I've had zero problems. I used to have 3 Mbps and upgraded to 12 just because my package expired so I had to change stuff around. I would recommend over Brighthouse just because from what I've researched it's cheaper in almost every way.  Edit: just wanted to add that I too live in the Highlands area."
Birmingham,36moxu,biggestjokeontheduck,1 point,Wed May 20 17:03:52 2015 UTC,Well since you live in the Highlands area you could just go outside and chill at one of the parks instead of getting cable.
Birmingham,36moxu,tsukit,1 point,Wed May 20 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"I have both Bright House and AT&T. Why?  Because Bright House has the best speed,  but when it rains in my area,  I lose digital cable and Internet.  AT&T works rain,  sleet or snow. Just slow as turtles mating. When I bought my Wii U, used AT&T to update,  it took 6 hours. I'm going to drop AT&T this month.  Just too damn slow."
Birmingham,36moxu,roddimus,1 point,Wed May 20 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"GF had Brighthouse and lived in Highlands and if the internet wasn't out the cable was. You could make the cable go out just by pressing too many buttons on the remote too quickly. They could never fix anything over the phone so they always had to make appointments to come by so she would have to leave work like once every 2 weeks. Just a freakin nightmare really, can't say or think about Brighthouse without saying ""fuck brighthouse"".   She switched to AT&T Uverse but only did the internet and hasn't had any problems so far. Everyones experience differs but fuck brighthouse always comes to mind."
Birmingham,36moxu,scootmcgroot,1 point,Wed May 20 21:36:40 2015 UTC,"I lived in the Irondale area for about a year and had Brighthouse. Paid $60/month for 60 Mbps. It was a promo rate they gave me for a year, but I only lived in that house for a year so it worked out fine for me. The service was also great. Only ever had one connection issue and they had a tech out the next day to get it sorted out.  I would advise that you get your own router, though (if you are going to have 2-3+ people with at least a phone and a computer connected). The one that was 'integrated' with the modem was a piece of garbage. But that can probably be said of most modem/router devices supplied by ISPs."
Birmingham,36moxu,RaptorBuddha,1 point,Wed May 20 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"My experience with Bright House has been nearly perfect for Internet and absolutely terrible for TV.  I think I'm on my 5th box in as many years.  The fact that they have SEC Network but won't give you access to SEC Network+ streaming is pretty stupid, too."

Birmingham,36moxu,OfWoodAndWire,4,Wed May 20 15:47:13 2015 UTC,$39.99/month for their 60mbps package. I get around 30-40mbps down and 4-5mbps up usually.

It would be way worse if everyone just ignored your shit, thereby deeming you too fucking boring to even fuck with. I read the original post, and didn't see anything that glaringly stuck out as sexist/offensive to others.

Birmingham,36j8xb,jmwbama311,7,Wed May 20 22:19:54 2015 UTC,"Live downtown or don't. Pick your neighborhood by driving through at different times to see if it's for you. The Highland area is particularly safe and pleasant. If you see random, normal people outside doing random, normal things (jogging, dog/child walking, park usage, biking) then it's safe to assume that it's probably a normal and safe area.   If you see people that you'd consider undesirable milling about or loitering and doing things that make you uncomfortable, then I'd suggest avoiding the area.  As I said in another thread this week, avoid anything west of 65N and you're fine. Avoid anything north of Uptown/20-59 and you're fine. Going east, Avondale is about the cutoff point for safety and comfort.   Southside can be sketchy at times and depending on what block you're on, but that's slowly being gobbled up by influx of new residents in existing homes/apartments.   If you can't parallel park, I'd recommend you avoid downtown completely. Or ride a bike/motorcycle/scooter...  There are areas of downtown that are kind unsavory (around the bus terminal, and a few blocks in each direction from there) but you'd have to go looking for trouble to find it.   Parking fees outside of the weekends are excessive. Mind parking signs/boards that state the cost and the legality of parking in lots. The downtown managers of those lots aren't shy about towing/booting vehicles."

I talked to them and they're going to bring in the Holler Mountain Blend, which was my go-to daily bean when I lived in the Pac NW. 3) Octane - Not as good as they used to be, but still better than most.    Honestly, these are the only ones worth considering unless you're in desperate need of caffeine."
Birmingham,36i2z2,derpderpdonkeypunch,3,Tue May 19 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"I've bought two varieties of beans from the Revelator and I wasn't very impressed.  Which coffee of theirs did you get and how do you brew it?    I generally french press my coffee, but occasionally I'll cold-brew a big batch of it and I tried both methods with their coffee and didn't much care for it.  I generally like coffees with an earthy, dark-chocolatey kind of flavor, so if they have anything like that, lemme know and I'll give them another shot."
Birmingham,36i2z2,derpderpdonkeypunch,3,Tue May 19 17:44:57 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't recall which roast I had.  I've been three times.  The first I had a cup of coffee which was nice, full, and round in flavor and well resolved with none of the dirt flavor that I despise in a coffee.  They use the pour over method.  The following times I had espresso drinks that were spectacular.    You should go by Satellite and try the Stumptown Holler Mountain Blend.  The girl told me to check back with them later this week for it.  I drank that daily for years.   In terms of method: I used to use a french press but, quite frankly, it's such a motherfucker to clean up and, the older i get, the more affected my stomach is by acid and, according to a family member that's a doc, caffeine is a direct stimulant of gastric acid.  The extra acid from coffee sitting in a french press winds up being a little too much for me to drink every day.  Now I use an aeropress.  It's a lot easier to clean up and once you run through the paper filters that come with it, you can get an etched metal filter that never need be thrown away.  An aeropress is great for making a single espresso or cup of coffee and gives you the body you'd get out of a french press cup without over-extracting and pulling out the acids.  If you haven't tried one, you should!"
Birmingham,36i2z2,derpderpdonkeypunch,3,Tue May 19 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"Have you tried cold brewing coffee?  It makes coffee with much less acidity and it's pretty easy, too.  I've heard good things about the aeropress, though, but I haven't tried it myself."

Really it's about timing. It's good to get beans 4-7 days after they are roasted so they have time to oxidize. I got a bag of Stumptown Columbian at Satellite, which were great, but I don't trust their turn around time right now.   Honestly you should start looking at the origin of the coffee and who harvests it rather than the roaster. Stumptown/Topeca use Cuarto M single origin beans which are top notch."
Birmingham,36i2z2,PurpleYoda3121,4,Tue May 19 18:03:25 2015 UTC,I've never heard of giving beans time to oxidize.  What does it do for the beans?  How does it affect the coffee?
Birmingham,36i2z2,Carlajeanwhitley,3,Tue May 19 18:52:14 2015 UTC,"Fresh roasted coffee, especially a darker roast, has a high level of CO2 trapped inside. There is a sweet spot where the coffee has released just enough CO2 while maintaining aromatics and freshness. This period generally lasts less than a week. For example, for a fresh cup you wouldn't want to use beans 14 days past it's roast date. Degradation (arguably) starts within 4 days. This is why most brew methods prefer a ""bloom"" period in which a small amount of water assists in releasing excess CO2 as it saturates."
Birmingham,36i2z2,Satellite_Bham,2,Tue May 19 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I just glanced over french pressing instructions on a website, today (to see if they recommended anything different from what I've been doing) and they mentioned a bloom period, thoug I wasn't sure what they were talking about."
Birmingham,36i2z2,AUBeastmaster,2,Tue May 19 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"Oxidation produces oxides, which can be more soluble or different in physical properties like flavor. I never had a chance to appreciate coffee sampled 1, 7, 14 etc days after roasting, but that's the chemistry of it and it makes perfect sense.  Normal oxidation makes the taste improve during the first few days, and it runs downhill from there. At the other end, too much oxidation makes foods taste stale and most preservatives are primarily antioxidants."
Birmingham,36i2z2,OfWoodAndWire,3,Tue May 19 21:01:37 2015 UTC,Talk to Camille at Saturn's Satellite. They take their beans serious and everything is always fresh. They go so far as to adjust grinds and doses based on time since roasting and never sell old beans.

Port holdups on the west coast have really impacted the food (and specialty coffee) industry.  Urban Standard does counter culture beans. Red bike coffee is also local. Octane used to be great but let their sourcing and roasting operations slip. Red cat is dumb, and ohenrys is just mediocre flavored coffee."
Birmingham,36i2z2,willco17,5,Fri May 22 01:51:16 2015 UTC,"If you think in terms of small batch vs big batch..  Big Batch    Octane is the easiest to find around town. You can get some pretty recent roasts for cheaper at Whole Foods. For some reason, their coffee is a few bucks cheaper there.  Stumptown is always great coffee. However, you might be better ordering online from them for fresher roasts. Still great coffee though. Satellite is the only venue that you can get a bag from. O'Henry's has a ton of options. They're the place to go if you like more flavored blends of coffee. Its a great place to go and hang out, but the coffee isn't that great. Red Bike is pretty good as well. I've had two blends from there that I love. However, one of them wasn't good at all. Still, 2 / 3 isn't bad.   Small Batch    Revelator makes great coffee, but it could be hit or miss depending on your preferences. Its still worth checking out though. I really dig them. Red Cat is pretty much the same way. They have some solid medium-bodied roasts. Seeds is really excellent. They're some super rad people roasting great coffee. I highly recommend checking them out. They're similar to Revelator in the sense of finding out what you like. I'm yet to have something there that I don't like."
Birmingham,36i2z2,AUBeastmaster,1 point,Tue May 19 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info - I'll make sure to check out Seeds, since so many people seem to be recommending it.

It's basically beans that are very lightly roasted (they're the color of sand), which means they're jacked up in the caffeine department.  I hate white chocolate, but the drink of choice seems to be the White Zombie, which is a white chocolate mocha made with this white coffee. When I owned a coffee shop, I bought my beans from Alex at Kaldi.com and was very satisfied with the espresso roast and the French.

Now it turns out that losing football also ends up being a large hit on the African American population of the school. Whether you like football or not, whether you think it's financially viable or not, the fact of the matter is that football was actually promoting diversity at UAB. And given that UAB prides itself on being a highly diverse university, I doubt that realized this particular unintended consequence.  Long story short, it's just interesting."

Birmingham,36h26n,Everwinter81,2,Tue May 19 12:21:41 2015 UTC,I love the CAP program.    Fun fact for any OTM visitors to downtown:  CAP will jump start your car or unlock it for you if you leave your keys.

Homewood (car broken into). On a side note, I absolutely love living in Birmingham and I never intend to move back to the 'burbs.   People that claim the entirety of Birmingham is dangerous are simply incorrect. The vast majority of crime occurs in a handful of concentrated areas.

The right comparison that people need to make is suburbs vs. individual Birmingham neighborhoods. It doesn't make any sense to compare Alabaster to Birmingham as a whole since Alabaster is a tenth the size of Birmingham.  Does this mean that there isn't a crime and poverty problem in Birmingham?

Birmingham,36h26n,JDH1234,4,Tue May 19 14:41:22 2015 UTC,"I've found, most of the time, that the people who claim downtown has bad crime are the people who fled to the suburbs in the 80's or have lived in the suburbs all their lives. A lot of suburbanites have this built in impression that downtown is unsafe because it was a kind of a ghost town from the very early 90's until about 5-10 years ago - a lot of abandoned buildings and hardly anyone stayed downtown after office hours.   Things are different now, a lot of areas are bustling with life. Sure there are still some sketchy areas, but you learn where to stay away from. The best thing you can do is decide for yourself. Spend the day at Railroad Park. Go get some food at one of the places around 20th St or the Loft District. Take in a Baron's game. Go to a brewery."

Before 2010, I would have considered downtown to be a little sketchy and unpleasant. Doesn't mean I was right, but it was the aftermath of the years I had been downtown prior to that.   I have spent more time downtown (as far south as Homewood, as far east as Avondale, as far west as 65N and as far north as Uptown. In that area, there's a giant change compared to, say, 10-12 years ago.  The area has been reclaimed, despite the speed bumps put in place by the City Council up through 2008. As of now, the neighborhoods are safer than ever, crime really only involves theft and robbery (haven't seen any burglary reports.) Violent crime in the area I described is way, way down. And if you're in a nightlife/residential area of downtown at night, you're unlikely to have any issues at all. If you're over by Alabama Power at 10pm, one might argue that you're placing yourself in a bad area on purpose? (No reason to be there?)  The area on 3rd Ave N from 65N going east until a block or two from the Alabama Theater is still kinda questionable, but it's not dangerous.  The apartments are aged and overpriced. The houses are more aged and more overpriced (to rent).   Really, the only ""danger"" you face downtown is the expense. It's very costly, but if you prefer that lifestyle of urban living, downtown is not only wonderful now, but only getting better with each passing day.

You're suggesting that a troublemaker in Ensley is going to leave their area simply to frolic in downtown to hinder or endanger people?   There's nothing in the downtown areas like 2nd Ave N, Uptown, or Lakeview that would appeal to the kinds of troublemakers that would be venturing in from Ensley.   Southside has a few places like 3000 bar, Bacchus/Sky/whatever above Waffle House, and Bumpers. And even then, trouble is at a minimum. And they're literally a 15-minute walk from Highland, yet that doesn't discourage patrons from going to Bottega, Highlands, Hot & Hot, Rojo, etc.  Bonus: If you knew anything about the culture that you're scared of, you'd know that the elements of that culture are oblivious to or uninterested in spending time in those areas. There's nothing entertaining for them (broad brush.)   That same culture also perpetuates in the Center Point area as well as the Eastlake community (around 1st Ave N and far, far to the east - past the 20/59 split.)  And don't forget about Northside - the neighborhoods just a few blocks from Uptown? (Norwood and Gate City.)   And yet...all is calm.

Birmingham,36exm6,PacerFan,1 point,Sat May 23 07:43:36 2015 UTC,"well, it is.   she was told that no marriage ceremonies could take place inside the probate court office, yet she continued to try to do so. she could have easily just gone outside in front of the courthouse. she did it on purpose to get arrested and make a scene. they weren't allowing straight couples to get married in there either, so it was completely fair.  I'm totally a supporter of marriage equality, but I'm also a rational person and don't support making a scene just for it's own sake. Same sex couples had already won in Federal Court, so there was no reason for her to be the way she was other than to be difficult."

Birmingham,36e90a,MichaelTunnell,0,Tue May 19 01:52:25 2015 UTC,By explaining the title wasn't from the article?
Birmingham,36e90a,BlazerMorte,2,Mon May 18 21:40:38 2015 UTC,"Misleading. The report, if you bothered to read it, says UAB, like 95% of all Athletic Departments, will run a deficit if football is returned. It also says UAB will run a deficit if football is NOT returned, and will lose around $2mil in revenue per year and will lose even more if UAB isn't allowed to stay in CUSA. The estimated deficit run also includes a presumed ""cost of attendance"" of $2k/athlete/year, which UAB has not made a commitment to be a part of.  The report also says that UAB football has near unanimous support in the community and nationally, and that bringing the team back could result in such good will that the team will become profitable very quickly. The report also does not include the new monetary contributions brought in recently, including the donations from the city, the unanimously approved increase in recreation fees for undergrads, and the millions donated from private citizens.  The report also mentions that the deficit includes money the could (and in their opinion should) be spent on improved facilities, but those aren't required costs. It also mentions that the City of Birmingham has already made it clear they are willing to change how they do business with UAB, specifically concerning Legion Field, in order to make football more economically viable. That position is not reflected in the report's numbers.  tl;dr you didn't read the report"
Birmingham,36e90a,Nordoisthebest,5,Mon May 18 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"So your saying that UAB will lose money regardless if football is returned or not? Because I read that as ""Yet Another Report that Says UAB Football Would Lose Money, But Not as Much as Before""   I did editorialize the title b/c it is true. This report does state that UAB will lose money from football. In an article from AL.Com the opening statement reads:   ""UAB's athletic department would have an annual deficit of $3.165 million if it reinstated football, rifle and bowling, according to a school commissioned report, obtained by AL.com.""   The report states (and I would agree) that there are external donations that have been pledged and lots of ""support"" from people but that is not a sustainable source of revenue year over year IMHO.

If you have just a plain gold band, they can stretch it a half-size very quickly. If you can still get your ring on and off, a half size is probably all you need to change!  Definitely call around first to see what the cost and wait time is, and be clear about the details of your ring to get an accurate price and turnaround time. Stretching a plain band will be very inexpensive, but if the ring has any engraving/sidestones/detail it may cost more."

Birmingham,36arop,mckulty,0,Mon May 18 02:54:11 2015 UTC,Yes.  I followed that and understand it completely.

Birmingham,36arop,Nordoisthebest,3,Mon May 18 16:31:14 2015 UTC,"Serious short term answer:  NASA is kind of important to the North Alabama economy.  So is the fine art of blowing shit up (military).  There's more overlap between these two than a lot of people know.  People only give a shit about infrastructure and finance reforms when they have jobs.  So, from a certain point of view, to a certain part of the population of certain states, yes, NASA is more important.  Serious long term answer:  Dinosaurs are extinct because their space program sucked.  And with that said, I'd vote for Sanders in a heartbeat.  I think it is sad that so many people think he has no chance.  It's like this shitty self fulfilling prophecy.  He's outside the mainstream == people think he has no chance == I'm not going to waste my money / vote on him == he now ACTUALLY has no chance."

It relies on the infrastructure and hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country.  All I'm trying to say is that Sanders will spend no money in this state because he has (unfortunately) no shot at the presidency.  I wish he did.  But he does not.  I'm not  saying that we shouldn't vote for him.  I'm saying that he has zero shot at the presidency.
Birmingham,36arop,WarriorHealer,2,Mon May 18 17:22:40 2015 UTC,"Also, every issue ever is important enough to vote on.  I sincerely believe that that sentiment is wholly responsible voter indifference and poor turnout.  We always get the government we deserve.  The current political climate and discourse is what we deserve when turnout is 40% for a presidential election because I guess some things aren't really that important to care about, I guess or whatever.

Why in the world would you go into a tiny restaurant to commit your crime?

You could also try Melt on 41st street or go to forest park and check out Silvertron which is a favorite of mine. There are a lot of non-chain places in birmingham to eat. just drive around the southside of town from five points to lakeview to forest park to avondale and you'll see plenty of places.

If I want food more quickly, then I go to the Juke Joint."
Birmingham,362603,badeya,5,Fri May 15 18:58:41 2015 UTC,Excellent! Another place that can be out of the first three things I ask for.
Birmingham,362603,MisterTito,4,Fri May 15 15:42:18 2015 UTC,"Cool. But I hope the place is better run than the Soul Kitchen. I live in Southside and the Soul Kitchen should be more convenient for me, but I've given up on that place and go to the Juke Joint when I want Saw's."
Birmingham,362603,southsam,4,Fri May 15 14:32:38 2015 UTC,The only problem I've ever experienced with Soul Kitchen is that it is insanely busy every time I go. Not their fault right?
Birmingham,362603,MisterTito,-1,Fri May 15 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"The first-in first-out ordering is annoying. No matter how simple your order, you're gonna wait behind every single order ahead of you. Also, they constantly run out of items, which they could mark as being out of on their chalkboard menu so you don't waste time in line.  Both are due to the small size of the place not being able to handle the crowd, I guess, but it's still enough reason for me to go elsewhere. Usually I'll have my order in 10-15 minutes at the Juke Joint, and they have A/C and beer."

I didn't criticize the quality of the food. I even said I go to a different Saw's, if you had any reading comprehension skills.   And oh, I'm sorry if I'm a little pissed off that I have to wait 45 minutes for a chicken sandwich and an already pre-portion and prepared side. That is piss poor management and you can't argue against that. All you can do is attack me.

Birmingham,362603,derpderpdonkeypunch,2,Fri May 15 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"Your oversensitive ass made the same comments last time I said the Soul Kitchen is poorly run.   Mainly because you're talking out of your ass.     And oh, I'm sorry if I'm a little pissed off that I have to wait 45 minutes for a chicken sandwich and an already pre-portion and prepared side. That is piss poor management and you can't argue against that.      Actually, yes I can.  They have a limited number of fryers.  The number of fryers is limited because space in the kitchen is limited and they have to make other things too.  Only a certain number of things can go into a fryer at once because if you put too many in there, it drops the temperature of the fryer and the stuff in the fryer doesn't get cooked properly.  Thus, if a bunch of people order fried things before you, it's going to take them a little bit before they can even start cooking your order.  If you want food more quickly, order something like the pork n' greens on grits.   All you can do is attack me.     That's not all I can do, but it sure is fun and, well, you make it so easy.      Sorry that you're such an Avondale or Brandon Cain fanboy that you take any criticism of an inadequate hole-in-the-wall so defensively.     I'm sorry that you have such a lack of understanding of the way restaurants and the cooking of food works that you are led to make broad statements like ""that's piss poor management"" every time you get upset.

Birmingham,362603,MisterTito,0,Fri May 15 21:21:25 2015 UTC,"I would order pork and greens, but they're usually out of greens. Hence ordering the chicken sandwich. And I've waited 30-40 minutes for pork and greens, too. And when every number is called, in order, before you get you're order that means you're not waiting on equipment. That means they're preparing each order, as ordered. Which is dumb.   Obviously you're the one who doesn't know what they're talking about. And I would relax and have a beer, but oh wait, they don't serve that. Seems like you should know that.  Anyway, your shtick is old Food Service Jesus.

That's rich coming from someone who, quite obviously, has no experience in a restaurant, whether front or back house yet who insists that the way a very successful restaurant is run is wrong.  This is despite the person that owns, opened, and manages it was sous chef at one of the best restaurants in Birmingham for seven years (and despite the fact that John Hall worked the line at the soul kitchen when he first moved back from NYC, and Hall has worked at Grammercy Tavern, Per Se, and was sous chef at Momofuku Ssam Bar) and, obviously, has a small but growing restaurant empire.    Please, o wise one, enlighten us as to how a couple of the rockstar chefs in this town, who are making sure that Birmingham continues to get national press, managed to miss this gross example of a badly setup restaurant.  I can't imagine why anyone would think that orders should be cooked in the order that they were received (you know, like it is done in pretty much every fucking restaurant in this country, including places like The French Laundry, but that's only been named as the best restaurant in the country a few times, so they may not know what they're doing over there) or why someone that ordered their food before someone else would want to receive their food first.    Also, there's plenty of beer next door at Avondale. Perhaps you should pull the stick out of your ass and head on over there. Be careful, though, they might be busy and you might have to wait a couple minutes for that beer."

Places like that have a $300%-400% markup on wine when the industry standard is 100% (and even Stitt only marks his bottles up 100% from retail.)  Perhaps you ought to take a look at what it actually costs to eat at Highlands, Bottega Dining Room, or Chez Fon Fon and get back to me.    Also, yes, Stitt's places do run out of stuff.

The one in Irondale is a decent size and it has 1 squat rack, 1 smith machine and an OK set of dumbbells. It was nice to be on a month to month contract and it was around $40/month.  Flex Fitness moved to Irondale about a year or so ago and I started going there in December of last year. I got a year contract and it's $10/month. I think you can do month to month at $15, with maybe a $50 deposit. It's pretty good if you're looking to lift. It's in an old furniture store building and they didn't really remodel much of it, so that's a little strange. Carpeted floors and track lighting...weird. There's two floors: first floor is mostly cardio machines and a few light weight machines and the second floor is all free weights. There's 1 squat rack, 1 half rack and maybe 3 power racks. There's probably 20 or so other plate loaded machines and maybe the most dumbbells I've ever seen in one place. ALso has lots of equipment I've never seen. It might be a little farther than you're willing to drive, but it could be worth a look. It can also get very bro-ish, but I just ignore it."

The councilors deliberate for hours, and with every passing minute, the tension grows untenable.      The crowd's protests quickly grow past a fervent pitch toward something more instinctual, primal. At the front of City Hall, a protester scoffs at his packmate's failure to break down the door, only to be unable to kick it down himself. His rage builds, and he begins kicking as if his limbs are unshackled to his body. Another protester summarily replaces the former until the unspoken order finally breaks, and a undulating, screaming mass of bodies bears its full weight against the door.     On the fringe of the increasingly unhinged crowd, one young girl instinctively turns and listens to the unpropitious sounds of a city district torn apart—not the sounds of City Hall, but the sounds of Southside at the hands of something incomprehensible.      ""At least it's not downtown,"" she says out loud with a dread that reaches through her body. She worries the crowd's furor will bring the thing here next.      She runs into the huddled mass of beings and pleads with the unseeable faces to quiet their guttural pleas, but she feels the tremors and knows it's too late for them. She feels a hand on her back, then feels herself tumbling to her knees. On the ground, she fights for space as the steps of the crowd are guided around her battered body. When she is finally able to stand again, she hears nothing.      The crowd has grown silent, and she finally sees the reason for it.      Up high on a balcony, the mayor waves his arms for attention, but he already has it.      An aide appears next to the mayor and hands him a megaphone. The girl only catches bits and pieces, but she hears enough at the beginning to know that she doesn't care to hear the rest. Her body goes cold just as the crowd roars their approval.      In unison the crowd turns and points at Vulcan high on the mountain.      Faces brighten, and the crowd claps and dances and screams their rapturous praises to the iron giant.      ""But it's just a fucking statue.""     The girl sobs."

There's several of the big box retailers in Hoover and a few high-end ones at the Summit. There's a place in the Brookwood Mall that has modern furniture, but it's expensive.  Southeastern Salvage will occasionally have nice stuff. They buy items from furniture stores that I assume are returns or have slight defects. I picked up two leather armchairs for much cheaper than the price at Williams-Sonoma.  If you really want stuff that looks/costs like furniture from Ikea, you'll probably just have to make the drive to Atlanta. If you have access to a big truck or SUV, it's not that bad.

Kids (and parents) will get to go through over 40 science demonstrations touching on topics from polymers to surface tension and more. Some of these demos can be messy so avoid wearing your nice clothes! Teachers are welcome to register and attend as well to get some ideas for things to bring into the classroom.   When?

They are still charging, just coming up with different ways to do it.  And honestly, I'm OK if they have to charge, that's fine.  But to charge for these events while simultaneously offering a half million dollar handout to a failed football program?  Not OK."
Birmingham,35qfwj,Vash108,0,Tue May 12 18:30:41 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%.  The City had been giving $250,000 a year beforehand, which obviously wasn't a big enough handout."

Yeah get all these kids through college and the majority of them leave for greener pastures.
Birmingham,35qfwj,BlazerMorte,0,Wed May 13 14:49:10 2015 UTC,"There's been some progress there too, though.  UAB has spun off a ton of startups, some successful, some not so much.  There's also the Innovation Depot, which is a great addition to downtown."
Birmingham,35qfwj,NJWhiskeyHunter,4,Wed May 13 15:14:14 2015 UTC,"Sports bring in more revenue than small art events do. The City also has a lot to lose if UAB loses its spot in Conference USA, with the loss of the basketball, soccer, track, and baseball/softball tourneys. The city could lose the bowl game too, with no football presence in the city. That's not too mention the thousands of hotels and meals for those events plus standard regular season games. Football is big money for a city, and this is simply a wise fiscal move."
Birmingham,35qfwj,BlazerMorte,7,Tue May 12 18:12:09 2015 UTC,"It's a lot more than just small art events.  It's things like the Mercedes Marathon (Sports!  Yay!).  Frankly, a lot of those events draw bigger crowds than UAB football games, and they draw them into the heart of the city, not some godawful dilapidated eyesore of a ""stadium"" in one of Birmingham's most dangerous neighborhoods.  Attendance says it all.  I'm not convinced this is a wise fiscal move."
Birmingham,35qfwj,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Tue May 12 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"A charity marathon, where very little money comes in and much of it is divided up among several charities, simply will not bring in the kind of money even a single-day spectator event will.   The Mercedes Marathon has a maximum of around 5200 participants, and possibly less as many people do multiple events. At around $60 per person, that's a maximum total income of $312,000. Now, I can't find the disbursement figures, but we'll just assume that the city takes all of that, which is most definitely not what happens.  The Birmingham bowl, for however, had an attendance of 30,083 people. There's no way for me to know how many people paid $30 for GA and how many paid $50 for premium seating, or how many people had team-affiliated comp'd tickets, so we'll just assume $30 across the board. That's $902,490, almost triple the marathon. That doesn't include any parking fees, concession stand income, merchandising, etc.  Both events will have hotel income too, but ignoring even the possibility of local runners not renting hotels and other minor factors, assuming an even percentage of both participants rent hotel rooms, 30,000 people will rent more hotels than 5,200, and they will spend more total at hotels and other tourist-y things.  So you may not see the different in tripling your money, but the Birmingham City Council does. And this isn't even for regular season football games, the other sports tourneys I've mentioned, other regular season games for those sports, etc."
Birmingham,35qfwj,BlazerMorte,1 point,Tue May 12 18:44:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, and let's not forget that the Birmingham Bowl has little to do with UAB (they provide some marketing and support services, and still could).  The bowl is owned and managed by ESPN Regional Television, and could still take place here without UAB having a football program.  Even if UAB is dropped from their conference, it likely won't matter as Conference USA rarely plays in the Birmingham Bowl.  In fact, the Birmingham Bowl web site still shows that the game (the 10th anniversary!) is on for October, as planned.  As long as the attendance stays up, and the viewership remains strong, losing UAB football doesn't mean we'll lose the Birmingham Bowl.  Nice try though..."
Birmingham,35qfwj,NJWhiskeyHunter,-1,Tue May 12 19:02:43 2015 UTC,"No, it's just proof that a generally uninteresting football game, one of dozens played in this city every year (also, remember how we lost the Super Six Seven to Auburn/Tuscaloosa?), makes around 8x the amount of money for the city as your best example of an event you'd prefer. Sports make money, spending money on sports makes money. You're arguing something that the facts present support, so why continue?"
Birmingham,35qfwj,BlazerMorte,5,Tue May 12 19:08:35 2015 UTC,"The facts don't support it.  You want to talk about facts?  Here's a nice one for you: UAB football never saw Birmingham Bowl or Classic level attendance.  So to say that you're going to see that kind of impact ""dozens"" of times a year is just plain wrong.  Not to mention your ""8x"" claim for the economic impact has been pulled directly from your rear end.  I want my city spending money on diverse activities for a wide audience.  They support football through the classic and the bowl, and it's not like we are hurting for football options in Alabama.  A half million (or as you so kindly pointed out, 2.5M total) handout to a failed program isn't where I'd like to see it go.  All the made up numbers in the world from the FreeUAB folks won't change my opinion on that."

Birmingham,35qfwj,NJWhiskeyHunter,4,Tue May 12 20:03:53 2015 UTC,"Bwahahaha, OK, so again with the cherry picking!  You picked the lowest attendance Birmingham Bowl in its history, and then stacked it against the few highest attendance UAB games over almost 20 years.  Nice, but not gonna hold up.  I also note that you didn't bother comparing it to the Classic, which usually tops 60K, blowing away UAB.  Also, you failed to note UAB's average attendance, which is FAR lower than the choice numbers you posted above, especially in recent years.  Now as for this comment:   Just to further my point, Hoover High School brought in $2.4 million in economic impact through only 3 prep football games. Mercedes Marathon: $2.6 million Birmingham Bowl: $10.7 million per year average ($96 million since 2006)   Yeah, so the Mercedes Marathon is pretty damn big!  And that's just one event.  And you're comparing it to a bowl game that we won't lose just because UAB doesn't have a football program.  I'm not debating that the Birmingham Bowl and the Classic are huge, they are.  What I'm arguing is that UAB football isn't, because it wasn't.  Unfortunately what you want and what's profitable doesn't necessarily add up (which is why UAB lost their program).  Sucks for you.  Cue the cries of conspiracy now, we're to that point in the discussion, right?"
Birmingham,35qfwj,BlazerMorte,-1,Tue May 12 20:13:56 2015 UTC,"Bwahahahaha...  Ok.  Sure.  Cherry pick your one biggest event and use it for the comparison.  Don't add in the spectators, families of the runners and other support folks that come for the marathon, that's fair too.

I can take every UAB football home game, the Magic City Classic, and several other games played in Legion Field, and compare them to the lone event you've offered up if you want, but it's not going to help your argument..."

Birmingham,35qfwj,jbhammontree,2,Tue May 12 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe not (it could happen still), but if losing football means losing CUSA, then we lose the CUSA basketball tourney, the softball tourney (and regionals), the soccer tourney (and regionals), the track championships (and regionals), all of which have large economic impacts.

Birmingham,35qfwj,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Tue May 12 19:10:29 2015 UTC,Legit question - Do we always host those tournaments or is it a rotational thing?
Birmingham,35qfwj,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Tue May 12 21:00:46 2015 UTC,"It's sort of rotational, the conference folks vote on who gets it.  It certainly wouldn't be us every year, or even guaranteed on a rotation."

UAB is expected to receive about $2.2 to $2.4 million this fiscal year from C-USA. The College Football Playoff is expected to be worth about $800,000 for UAB.   So UAB makes between $2.2 and 2.4 million from CUSA, $800,000 of that alone is from simply fielding a football team that happens to play in a division with a championship game.  I anxiously await your non-response."
Birmingham,35qfwj,BlazerMorte,3,Tue May 12 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"Not in Birmingham, in fact UAB football was so lowly populated that any vendor at the stadium was taking a hit."
Birmingham,35qfwj,NJWhiskeyHunter,-3,Tue May 12 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"Not true, and how would you know, I don't think you've ever even been to a game.   UAB was 4th in CUSA and 25th in all non-Power 5 teams in attendance last season.  More facts! Whoopie!"

It also doesn't hurt that I've talked to people who were vendors at the games long before we were at UAB and long after you were gone.  Also, 4th not counting 5 teams puts it in 9th."

Birmingham,35qfwj,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Wed May 13 04:34:24 2015 UTC,Don't you think it is a sound investment to spend $500k a year on something that brings in a couple million in tax revenues a year to the city.
Birmingham,35qfwj,Geeky_Frignit,0,Wed May 13 15:01:09 2015 UTC,"I think there are better ways to spend that 500k that will have a similar level of economic impact while at the same time enticing more people to come to the parts of the city that are experiencing a revival.  One of Birmingham's biggest challenges is one of perception.  People think the city is run down and dangerous.  Let's invest in events that show them that isn't the case.  Then they'll come back and keep coming, which is how we keep the ball of downtown redevelopment rolling!"
Birmingham,35qfwj,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Wed May 13 15:18:56 2015 UTC,"I don't believe you're correct. The city has years of accounting history supporting investment in UAB football. They've been supporting the team previously, and they're not doing this out of the kindness of their hearts. They're doing it because they see a return on their investment.  So, you're saying they should forego trying to get a known revenue stream back in the city in lieu of nebulous ""better ways"" that you speak of.  I think the real story here is Birmingham sees lower tax revenues in the future without UAB football and without access to Conference USA events, and they are putting their money where there mouth is. Without this investment in football, they may not have the tax dollars to fund those engagements that are bringing people to revived areas of the city.  I don't have time to dig into budgets and whatnot, so this is purely speculation."
Birmingham,35qfwj,lemonhighfives,1 point,Wed May 13 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying.  20 years of UAB football downtown didn't exactly cause the city to blow up with revitalization.  It's time to try something else.  There's more to it than just tax revenue."

Between Oak Mountain and the BJCC, we've typically been able to draw most of the big acts at some point.   The city is definitely doing well now, but I wouldn't consider it new growth out of nothing.   I think the recent developments can largely be credited to shifting demographics and increasing hipsterfication."

Birmingham,35q39q,awayfromit,3,Wed May 13 02:51:15 2015 UTC,"For me, my interest in live music came out of a lack of anything else to do. It seemed that ten years ago when I was a teenager going to see bands play at DIY venues was really it when it came to night time activities. The south has always had a penchant for music though and alabama is no exception. Also, let's make Birmingham into what it will be and not try to be the Austin or wherever else of the south.

And I don't think Birmingham will be the Austin of the South. Not to burst your bubble, but your talking about one venue opening and another closing.  Net gain = 0.  Austin has hundreds of venues, so many more than Birmingham will EVER have.  The city practically turns into a music festival for one week each year where stuff that isn't venues becomes venues.  I've lived in Houston most my life, booked shows in Houston, and Austin. 20+ bands @ SXSW at our venue before i came to bham.  It's a far cry from Austin.  All that said, the really cool thing about Birmingham is it's underdevelopness.    I believe there is tons of opportunity in this city without the scathing competition such as in Austin.   Birmingham can be a laboratory for interesting ventures because of the city's dynamic.  Read: Accessible, small, underdeveloped.  But it's not going to be an Austin.  That's the thing, nothing is really close to an Austin, which is why  Austin is so different, in the same way New Orleans is borderline Euro culture dropped into Lousiana inhabited by a city of semi functioning alcoholics  No city will ever be Nola, No city will ever be Atx, and not city will ever be Bham, except the namesake themselves.  2cents."

I just bought a house in Avondale back in November, and a loft or condo downtown was an option I was considering. Two of the biggest issues were parking (I have a car and a motorcycle) and a good spot to walk the dog.   I know lots of people have pets and live downtown, but I have a fairly good sized dog and need/desire a decent sized grassy area that she can do her business, with trash can and bags nearby like you see at a park.  Also, if you're going to be doing new renovation, let me suggest you wire those places up very well. Don't try to cram your own ISP business deal into the building, but, put network outlets in every room, and multiple ones throughout each room, and have them go back to a central wiring closet that the owner/tenant can get to and install their own ISP and network equipment."
Birmingham,35ptr4,mixduptransistor,2,Tue May 12 15:44:02 2015 UTC,I've thrown the idea around. I'm just interested to hear folks thoughts and this is exactly what I was hoping to get.  In order to be zoned appropriately each loft will require one dedicated parking place. Which would be included with rent.  I get the pet issue. I know RR is a long way away. I'm not sure what folks do with their dogs besides walk them around the sidewalks to the green space. One option would be to put a dog run area on the roof of the building and have a trashcan and bags there.
Birmingham,35ptr4,aerinjl1,4,Tue May 12 15:52:02 2015 UTC,The Avenue Lofts on 1st have a mini-golf course on the roof which doubles as dog-play-zone. It's a really neat idea.

There's also LIV Parkside across from Railroad Park with $228 units.  IMO, there are more than enough lofts already available (not including the aforementioned); however, the problem is cost.  All lofts in downtown range between $1000-2000 per month which is expensive for most singles and it seems the majority of couples are looking for houses so there's a void.  Unless you feel like taking an unnecessary risk or offering sub-$1000 units I'd recommend staying from developing new properties."
Birmingham,35ptr4,BriscoCounty,2,Wed May 13 18:23:18 2015 UTC,"Negative on that.    The list of people looking for lofts is incredible.

Retail Specialists Southside mixed use deal 20 Midtown ( 2 phase Publix with 200 units) Harberts deal on Highland Ave. Rumored deal that Sloss Real Estate is doing   Historic Renovations that will compete with Lofts:   Brown Marx ( 180-220 units ) great views Thomas Jefferson Building Pizitz Building Lichters Furniture Lofts Phoenix Lofts next door ( 25 lofts) The Sher's loft project  Omni Building 15th Street South Lofts   The market will gobble these up.  Goodall Brown and Fix Play have a 20 person waiting list, three years ago the avg unit would be empty for two weeks before being leased.  I personally believe the best project in the city will be Pizitz, followed by Brown Marx.  Pizitiz because parking is attached, Bayer doesn't do anything half assed, and they love green space.  Brown Marx has incredible views, but parking will be a block away.  They will more than make up for it with the finishes though.   BriscoCounty is spot on with the new units, but the older lofts are pushing $1.00 - $1.10 sq ft now.  Demand is HIGH.    ""If you can split them smaller you should, the newer projects are getting anywhere from $1.35 - $1.75 psf/month for small (800 sf) units. The older and bigger loft units downtown (around 1800 sf) are only getting around .75 psf/month ""  Also the problem is that the developers to get funding, have been making pro formas from ;  The Hill Apartments, Lane Parke ( which is only 49 % occupied), and the sky high lofts that are that way due to demand.    What are people looking for in lofts, to answer your question?    Two Bathrooms.  A must. Windows and light. Kick ass bathrooms and kitchens Green space some where and somehow.

Birmingham,35ptr4,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Thu May 14 04:12:05 2015 UTC,Negative on what? Anyone can sign up to be on a waiting list or look for lofts but that doesn't mean 'the market will gobble up' $1000+ per month luxury lofts.  I'm simply pointing out that there are 371 new units under construction that will be in that price range and in that area.  And yet our building has had units available for sale the last several years. Renting new units might be do-able but for an investor relying on renter occupancy is far less desirable than the option of selling.
Birmingham,35ptr4,aerinjl1,1 point,Thu May 14 04:14:57 2015 UTC,"Dude, he is right.  Even a year ago when I was looking for either a purchase or a rental there was a shortage of stock.  The market has only gotten hotter since then.  In the 10 months I have lived in my building we have seen almost all of our available units sell pretty quickly.  The demand for downtown units is super high right now."

I think demand in general will continue to rise as more people consider moving downtown and lofts will outpace the other types of housing. As millennials are finally able to purchase a home, they are going to prefer unique space over cookie-cuter refurbs/new construction.  I live in a loft (partial-true) on 1st so I could be biased."

But you'll see my comments and I think (personally anyway because I cite a lot of personal experience) that a lot of it is being blown out of proportion or being compared to the bham 20+ years ago, which we have changed a lot from but that was 20 years ago. It'd be almost impossible not to change. Still nice to see not all bad publicity but a lot of people are ignoring some of our major problems imo"

We are in the top 10 for crime. I love my city but we are broke and not doing well and a lot of people are ignoring it. Not crapping on peoples happiness. Just bringing some of the claims of how great a place it is to live back down to earth.

Birmingham,35o3bc,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Tue May 12 17:36:21 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on where you are working, benefits offered, etc.  If I were hiring a totally entry level developer in Birmingham to work on Java / Linux, I'd probably be looking to pay them somewhere between 45K and 60K / year, depending on education and (more importantly) experience.  A Windows / .NET developer, probably a little less, a hardcore Python / C geek, probably a little more.  If you have some quality code you can show, like an open source project you maintain or contribute to, you'd fall on the higher end of that scale.  As an aside, if you want to get some extra experience under your belt and network a bit, have you looked at Code for Birmingham?  They always need extra hands, and they would love somebody with Linux experience.  Especially if you are handy with automating it."
Birmingham,35o3bc,n00gums,2,Tue May 12 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"I've been working in Birmingham for over 5 years as a C#/.NET developer ever since I graduated college. I'll tell you that Birmingham is mostly a Java/.NET (C#/VB) city. There are occasional jobs for other languages (I've seen Python and Ruby the most), but they're usually not looking for junior developers.   I see in another post you mentioned Java. There are a fair amount of Java-based companies out there, but I'm not sure what their underlying architecture looks like. I suspect they're Windows for development and might have some Linux servers here and there.  As far as salary range, expect $45-55k for less than 1 year, and $45-65k for less than 2 years. The unfortunate state of our industry means that if you want a raise/promotion, you'll likely have to jump ship. Keep in mind that this is for .NET/Java jobs. Python/C/Ruby/etc might be higher/lower.   If you can provide a bit more information (like how soon you're looking for a job, actual experience, maybe even a resume), I can give you more information. I have a bunch of contacts from recruiters that I'd be happy to pass your resume on. The other possibility is to look remote. There are a lot of companies looking for remote employees that use Python/Ruby on Linux. The only caveat is that they're usually not looking for junior developers. Usually mid-senior level developers.   tl;dr: $45-60k for 0-2 year .NET/Java Jr. Developer. Python/Ruby/Linux jobs are few and far between. They're mostly looking for mid-senior level candidates."

Birmingham,35liyx,DT777,5,Mon May 11 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"Auburn's bike lanes are a joke. Half the time there are cars parked in them or construction equipment left in them. And they didn't make the roads wide enough to really safely add a bike lane either. Some bigger trucks and SUVs don't really have much choice but to stick into the bike lane going through turns. They basically painted a false sense of security onto the roads in Auburn (or at least it was this way a few years ago). I stopped riding my bike to class because of this - I never felt safe on the roads, and didn't like riding on the sidewalk where people are supposed to be walking."

Birmingham,35liyx,chinesedeliveryguy,-1,Tue May 12 15:40:24 2015 UTC,"Don't think about cyclists like something to avoid.  They aren't nats.  They are space taking, lane holding vehicles.  If they aren't going as fast as the rest of the traffic, that's because they are human powered.  In a hurry, go around them.  You sound lazy, your perspective on dealing with people on the road is lazy.  It's also dangerous, and kind of self-centered.  Sorry to inconvenience you for being on the road when you're on it.   Satisfied?"
Birmingham,35liyx,JDH1234,2,Tue May 12 17:20:34 2015 UTC,They are not lane holding but they are space taking. If they held the lane it would be illegal to pass them. It's why it's called sharing the road but if you want to be the prick that's causing people unnecessary stress while they're trying to get home then by all means go ahead. Exercise for one person at the expense of everyone else's time and stress seems pretty self centered to me.

It means, cars are vehicles like bicycles, and both warrant the same respect on the road.  Hey man, I'm just trying to get home too.  And to what expense?  Stress?

We're working with the urban and regional planning commission to get more bike infrastructure, though, and a bikeshare program is coming to downtown, so that's going to be pretty exciting. As it stands now, the best riding is either out towards Tannehill/McCalla or east through Leeds/Chelsea."
Birmingham,35liyx,AUBeastmaster,4,Mon May 11 14:48:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I lived in SF and DC for two years each, they've got great trails there.

Now that I'm back in Birmingham, it looks like I can afford a bike (just without anywhere to ride it)."
Birmingham,35liyx,AUBeastmaster,3,Mon May 11 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"Roads in unincorporated parts of the counties around B'ham are great, you've just got to get out there (or become a climber). Group rides leave from Bob's Bikes in Homewood most days of the week, and BBC in Mountain Brook on other days. Riding east generally means you've got to be on 78 for at least a little bit. Sicard Hollow is a nice road, but can get busy, so it's better to ride with a fast-moving group (i.e., Tuesday Worlds) for safety.  Riding west, through Ross Bridge or Sparks Gap towards the Bessemer Airport/Tannehill is the perfect mix of good terrain and ligthly-trafficked roads."
Birmingham,35liyx,vallancj,2,Mon May 11 15:45:15 2015 UTC,Who will bikeshare if there is no where to ride?  Downtown only?
Birmingham,35liyx,AUBeastmaster,3,Mon May 11 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"Initially that's the scope of the bikeshare.  It's aimed at making downtown more bike friendly at first (i.e., go to a Baron's game, then ride over to Avondale, for example) instead of driving around. Or it will allow people to get from downtown to the West End, perhaps.   Birmingham's terrain is challenging for novice riders. Hopefully more people will see how incredibly easy it is to ride around downtown though, after using the bikeshare."

Way less people inside the city center which means way less cars. I mean, 1/3 of the towers in downtown are abandoned.  Honestly, I love riding in bham.  It's wide open, flat on the north side of the tracks and drivers, believe it or not are quite respectful.  More so than Houston.  I've been commuting for 7 years, and riding here isn't scary.  The worst thing are the hills.  And coming from Houston, they are welcome.  Don't believe the hype.  Alabama is a fine place to ride bikes.  It's not quite as established, but people, by my experience, give me my lane, don't buzz me.  And I havent been lit by a paintball gun yet in the hood.  (yes, this happened in Houston)"

There's a woman in Hoover who rides up 31 coming from the direction of Pelham at approx 8:30am every morning who does not wear a helmet, does not signal, does not stop at stop signs, and does not stay on her side of the road. One of these days she's going to be hit.  I'm happy to share the road with cyclists, but I'm going to need them to be mindful of traffic as well. This includes using common sense regarding when and where to ride.   Additionally, I'm perplexed at why all of the complaining, whining cyclists don't lobby the City Councils in the area to create bike lanes throughout the city. Portland and it's suburbs had them when I lived there over 30 years ago, so it's definitely not a new idea..."

Birmingham,35liyx,slowbike,3,Mon May 11 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"I cycle the urban core of Birmingham on a daily basis and have never felt unsafe or endangered. Maybe it's because I cycle at a moderate speed and purposely choose my route and ride times to avoid motorists. We can all share the road. But the highways are best left to motorists. On a Sunday or Saturday morning you can bike through the heart of downtown and have every street to yourself. Name me another state where you can do that in the most populous city? And we have Oak Mountain which is recognized as world class trail riding for the MTB set. We have two, not one but two, non profit cycling organizations that do all kinds of good work. Bici Coop and Redemptive Cycles. Screw 50th. I think we are #1 every time my feet hit the pedals."
Birmingham,35liyx,Ben_Afflock,3,Tue May 12 00:10:09 2015 UTC,I'm convinced that cycling in most parts of Alabama is risky to the point of suicide. I'm still shocked that bikes are allowed on public roads without the correct infrastructure.  Bicycles shouldn't be street-legal without a labeled bike-lane. I've seen far too many people take their lives in their own hands biking down curved and hilly roads with a speed limit of 55mph.  That is the definition of taking your life in your own hand and it shocks me when Bicyclists act entitled to risk their life on these death-trap roads and blame everything on the motorists without even considering their unsafely low speeds and lack of traffic signals.  I'm more than okay with bicycling being a celebrated part of a city but let us be realistic here. A Bicyclist going ~20mph on a road with an average speed of 50mph is going to put everyone's lives in danger.
Birmingham,35liyx,CLSmith15,7,Mon May 11 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"With the exception of restricted access roads such as interstates and roads with a speed minimum, bikes have as much right to the road as cars.  So the reason cyclists act entitled to the road is because they are entitled to it.  A smart cyclist will avoid roads with higher average speeds when possible, but it's ridiculous to say that bikes shouldn't be allowed on the road without a bike lane.  In most cases it is motorists who aren't paying attention that put everyone's lives in danger, not the cyclists.  Also cyclists have traffic signals, they're called arms."
Birmingham,35liyx,Ben_Afflock,1 point,Mon May 11 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"Here is the problem. Most people on the roads are operating cars. These cars go much faster than bicycles. Bicycles are a road hazard by moving so slowly.  I know on paper it says bicycles are allowed to use the road. Fine. But don't blame motorists when a collision happens around a turn or a bend when travelling less than half the average speed on these roads.  Its just not safe. Many of these rules were made a long time ago and bicyclists are going to cling to them. Perfectly fine. I'm just going to be honest it is exasperating to nearly collide with a slow moving bicyclist around blind turn and have them be mad at ME for their decision to be a road hazard.  Let's have people take responsibility for doing something incredibly dangerous like riding a bicycle in an area with a very fast average speed.  The reason I think Bicycling is far more understandable in towns because its well known congestion lowers speed and it makes bicycles much more sensible a choice. Especially with the correct infrastructure.  As of now a bicycler is a burden, a dangerous burden, on many roads."
Birmingham,35liyx,ginasaurus-rex,6,Mon May 11 18:49:30 2015 UTC,"But don't blame motorists when a collision happens around a turn or a bend   You are aware that if it wasn't a cyclist, but another car going 20mph, you would be 100% at fault for hitting it right? You're supposed to slow down in a curve. Do you know why? Because you can't see what's around it. You should never be going so fast that you can't stop before rear-ending another vehicle."
Birmingham,35liyx,CLSmith15,4,Mon May 11 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, but I don't think the solution is to label all roads as unsafe for cyclists and basically shift the blame by saying ""well you knew the risks when you rode in the street"".  Riding on a bike is just like riding in a car, I'm trusting that the people around me will follow the rules.  The only difference is the stakes."
Birmingham,35liyx,Ben_Afflock,1 point,Mon May 11 19:30:31 2015 UTC,"There needs to be some responsibility taken for going around half the average speed and even less on a hill.  It's beyond dangerous and people aren't taking any responsibility for it other than blaming everyone else. If someone is so stubborn that they let ""their right"" to the road cloud their judgement on what roads are safe to cycle then they are a part of the problem.  Fwiw I've never had a collision and I actually have a bicycle I use at the park sometimes."
Birmingham,35liyx,CLSmith15,4,Mon May 11 19:49:41 2015 UTC,"If a cyclist is visible and there is collision, the blame is with the driver regardless of the cyclist's speed.  The driver clearly wasn't paying attention or they would have seen the cyclist.  I understand drivers get frustrated with being behind a cyclist, and I don't want to create traffic, so I try to let drivers by when I can.  But the fact is I have as much right to the lane as the driver does, if I'm obeying the rules then there won't be a collision unless a driver isn't obeying the rules."
Birmingham,35liyx,ginasaurus-rex,2,Mon May 11 19:21:22 2015 UTC,"Of course there is a risk. Most sports carry risk. What I object to is that the way to minimize said risk is ""cyclists should just get off the road, and don't blame me if I slam my multi-ton vehicle into you because I was being negligent."" The solution is for the driver to pay attention to other vehicles on the road. Doesn't matter if it's a cyclist, a postal truck, or your grandma trying to read a street sign.   I accept the risk of injury or death if I'm on a bike, and the driver accepts the possibility of prison time for manslaughter if they don't look where they're going."
Birmingham,35liyx,CLSmith15,3,Mon May 11 19:32:32 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't see how bicycles moving slowly relative to cars are a hazard when drivers and cyclists are both paying attention.  I'm a cyclist and a driver so I feel like I have some perspective on this.  As a driver, even if a cyclist is just around a blind turn, you shouldn't be going around the turn so fast that you don't have time to slow down.  How is a cyclist being there any different than the possibility of a line of cars being stopped just out of sight?  As a cyclist, if you are going around a blind turn or are in an otherwise potentially dangerous spot, you should be on the shoulder and not in the lane.  If you cannot pass through without creating a dangerous situation then you should find another route.  I used to have to bike uphill and around a bend on a fairly busy road as part of my route (Montclair Rd going from Ramsey Park towards downtown), and I never had an issue because I was smart about it and stayed as far to the side as I possibly could.  You also have to remember that cyclists are very, very aware of the fact that they would be on the worse end of any potential collision, so for the most part we're very cautious.  If someone is cycling in a stupid way on the road, that means they are a stupid person and I'd personally rather them be operating a bicycle than a two-ton chunk of steel moving 60 mph."

While I do have a responsibility as a cyclist to ride in a safe, legal, and predictable manner (i.e., not running red lights/stop signs or cutting corners, riding on the sidewalk, or riding erratically) it is also up to motorists to drive safely, with awareness, not texting, and most importantly, not being a dick."
Birmingham,35liyx,AUBeastmaster,5,Tue May 12 11:48:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely. One reason why I never train with music/other distractions and prefer to ride in a group for visibility.

What's the best way to improve cycling culture to promote awareness and infrastructure support? Shoot on sight cyclists who ride on the sidewalk.  When a cyclist approaches me from behind on a sidewalk, I extend my arms.  Fuck that guy.  It's the sideWALK.  Not sideRIDE.  The roads too shitty to ride on? Get proper tires and learn how to operate your bike, or do everything you can as a citizen to lobby the government.

I must be crazy. :(  But the first part of the comment is where I'm serious.  Birmingham is a perfect canvas and landscape for improvement.  It's okay that so much of our shit is shitty.  That means there's less crap to get out of the way and more willingness to change (hopefully!).  This is a beautiful town that will eventually get its bike lanes.  We need to bike culture to grow and be legitimized before that happens.  It's not a bikes vs motorists issue at all, even though we make it out to be and shitty fixies are for granola free-love communists and poor people."

Birmingham,35fhg3,tramsay,3,Sat May 9 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"Neil at Oxmoor is great, I've had a few lessons from him, although, the last one was two or three years ago. His English accent makes the lesson even better.  Downside is actually scheduling a lesson with him.  He's always doing clinics, so my schedule and his never like up.  His rates were around $90 an hour.  I've heard good things about Greystone.  I don't  think you have to be a member to get a lesson there.  There are several people to get lessons from there with a wide range ($75 - $200 per hour) of rates.  Only guy I've met there is Darryl because he used to work at Ross Bridge.  He's a Tarheel, and that's a plus in my book.  Dave at Riverchase is good, and easier to schedule with than Neil at Oxmoor, plus he's close to home for me.  Golfsmith offers lessons. I did a swing evaluation there with a Groupon a few years ago.  They pushed packages of lessons way too hard.  You're hitting off a mat too.  Scheduling is easier and weather is never an issue indoors.    My first choice is Neil at Oxmoor.  Wow, he had me playing the best golf of my life (tee to green) in 2010.

Birmingham,35f0n3,Enragedpixel,1 point,Tue May 12 19:36:58 2015 UTC,Its the same with hoover cops in the area.(hoover is everywhere as well) Vestavia police keep crime down but the roll more like a militia. Blacked out cruisers with lights usually inside the vehicle. They like to hide in shady spots and harass anyone they can to try and trump up as much ticket cash as they can. Hoover is just as aggressive but their cruisers are white and have top mounted lights usually.   Know your rights and be kind and respectful but don't let them take advantage of you. Some of them are just trying to make a name in the department.
Birmingham,35f0n3,john_snuu,1 point,Tue May 12 22:38:30 2015 UTC,Right. I meant on your personal experience.
Birmingham,35f0n3,Enragedpixel,0,Tue May 12 22:42:08 2015 UTC,Well that was the other guy but I was backing up his claims of their aggressiveness. My experience was with hoover. Pulled over for doing 5 over and the cops attitude was more like I had called his daughter promiscuous. And I was as polite as could be. (I'm very conflict avoidance when it comes to police I was not going to disrespect him) but I was still treated like dirt. I've had friends complain of cops trying to make any excuse for searching their cars and cops that like to sit in speed traps a lot. They can be a pain but the crime rate is low I 'spose
Birmingham,35f0n3,tkeiy714,1 point,Tue May 12 22:52:05 2015 UTC,Uh no. There's nothing else to elaborate on. They act real aggressive and prey on people they think they can get an easy ticket or arrest out of.

Birmingham,35f0n3,Enragedpixel,1 point,Sun May 10 00:32:21 2015 UTC,Love the bank choice and totally agree. But a lot of areas also have att uverse. Just my two cents but its my personal favorite of the three.
Birmingham,35f0n3,MichaelTunnell,5,Tue May 12 22:32:56 2015 UTC,"Banking:  Pretty much any Credit Union is basically going to be the best option for personal accounts, but make sure they are a part of the Credit Union Co-Op network.  The Co-Op network allows you to use any physical location of any credit union also involved in the co-op to do various banking actions without any penalty for not doing at your exact credit union.  You didn't mention anything about a job so if for any reason you need a Business Bank Account I would suggest BancorpSouth as they have the most reasonable accounts for businesses.  Do you need a physical location? I ask because Ally Bank is a very good option for personal accounts as long as you don't need a physical location.   Ally pays all ATM fees regardless of where you withdraw the cash and higher interest return than any other bank but it means that you can not deposit cash since there are no physical locations anywhere (not just locally, anywhere at all)  There are methods to get around this lacking of cash deposits:   Buy Money Orders with the cash and deposit the money orders. Create a Credit Union account as well just for the cash while using Ally for checks and direct deposit. You could use this account just for cash or you could use it to write checks to send to Ally.   Cable:  It really depends on where you are going to be living as we do not get to choose from more than one cable ISP. Your only choice is to check who is servicing the place you move to before you move to it.  I would prefer Charter but some people seem to like BrightHouse as well, I've only had bad experiences with BrightHouse so I always prefer Charter.  Either way, the option you have is Charter or BrightHouse but you can only choose via location.  However, it may not even matter in the future. Charter announced on March 31, 2015 that they are attempting to buy BrightHouse so if that happens we will have no choice at all. - http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-charter-to-buy-bright-house-cable-20150331-story.html"

Birmingham,35f0n3,responds-with-tealc,1 point,Sat May 9 22:14:36 2015 UTC,"charter has really been turning it around the past few years. the only issue i see with the purchase is less competition in the market.   i paid $55/mo (after all promos expired ) for about 60Mbit/s dowb with charter for 4 years, never any issues. just moved and switched to brighthouse @ $70/mo about 80Mbit/s down; no issues yet."

There are many small local banks around that provide great customer service. I highly recommend Renasant Bank.  As for cable, you will be locked into either Charter or Brighthouse depending on where you live. AT&T U verse is in select areas. Otherwise, your options are Dish Network or DirecTv. If you go with DirecTv, send me a PM and I can refer you and you will save an extra $10 per month for 10 months."
Birmingham,35f0n3,willco17,6,Sat May 9 19:45:41 2015 UTC,"If you feel like you need access to a lot of physical locations, Regions is literally everywhere. It's even across the street from itself in Vestavia.   Compass is the other mega bank with a large hq here but it's not as widespread. They have free checking and they have a new feature that lets you send money to other people with Compass instantly.   Credit unions are good and I've personally used APCO and like it. Legacy has a checking account that pays more interest than most savings accounts."

My issue, and the issue of many of my cohorts is the cost of both TV and internet service can't be justified. There are only two cable channels with substantial content I care about, AMC and HBO. Access to both of these channels requires me to have a $90.00-$120.00 monthly cable subscription of 200+ channels, of which there are only two I care about watching.  Yes, I am aware of the recent release of HBO NOW, and rumors of an AMC app with AMC original content."

He lived out of a cave and would have naked sunbathing redneck women laying out on the rock you used to climb out of the water after jumping from pine tree.  He would also pick up pine tree jumpers in ""the yacht"", which was an inflatable boat bought with Marlboro Miles.  He was a nice guy, who looked like Hulk Hogan, and would buy us beer at the Amoco gas station.  We used to drive under the bridge, behind Velma's, through water and down the train tracks to get there.

Birmingham,35at51,NJWhiskeyHunter,16,Fri May 8 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"Some people think the city council is paid off by the taxi companies. Other people think Uber is trying to skirt under the rules.  The actual nuts and bolts of it is that Uber doesn't want to accept the regulations that the city has imposed. That is the fact of the situation. Now, whether you think those regulations are reasonable is a matter of opinion that has generated a lot of threads around here."
Birmingham,35at51,mixduptransistor,2,Fri May 8 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"Not to go too far down the rabbit hole again, but it's worth noting that Uber has been willing to adapt its business practices to enter other markets before: http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304703804579379884010342724  Can't imagine that China is a more forgiving business climate than Birmingham (but obviously the market is much more lucrative).  Anyway (full disclosure), I'm a columnist with AL.com (I'd been on reddit for a little while but started a new account today with my actual name to be  transparent) and next week we're going to be debating whether or not Alabama should change its laws to accommodate companies like Uber.   Thanks guys for putting all this info in one place - it's a great resource as we try to figure out exactly what's been happening behind the scenes."
Birmingham,35at51,jbhammontree,7,Fri May 8 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"China is definitely a more forgiving business climate because you don't have to bribe people secretly. You can buy political influence openly without fear of repercussions.  And we should have a discussion about Uber, but the current bill that would take the power away from the cities and give it to the PSC of all people is a disaster. Go ask John Archibald about the PSC and get back to me.  The willingness of people to sell their state down the river for some convenience is really sad. I would love to have Uber or Lyft, but I want them to respect our laws, pay their fair share, and also not give away even more local powers to Twinkle Cavanaugh."
Birmingham,35at51,mixduptransistor,6,Fri May 8 16:26:54 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Not to mention that Twinkle would have to hire a staff to manage it, which is completely incongruous with all their bluster about shrinking government."

Birmingham,35at51,mixduptransistor,3,Sun May 10 01:32:01 2015 UTC,"I'm keen to see this debate happen on a forum like AL.com.  It's no secret that I come down HEAVILY on the side of these transportation app operators, mostly due to the incredibly poor service offered by our current taxi operators.  I don't like the PSC at all, but I'm even more disgusted by how our city council handled this.  That leaked email in which Kim Rafferty basically gloated about how quickly they were able to dispense with Uber's attempt to do business here disturbed me.  We didn't even get the chance to have a real debate about it, they just drafted the changes and rammed them through so quickly that nobody had a chance to respond."
Birmingham,35at51,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Sun May 10 16:13:24 2015 UTC,As promised -- here are the opening arguments for this week's debate on Uber: http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/05/should_alabama_lawmakers_pave.html#incart_river
Birmingham,35at51,jbhammontree,4,Fri May 8 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"Upvote for the fact of the matter.  Opinion:  Our transportation regulations are fucked, which is why we only have a few shitty cabs as an option."
Birmingham,35at51,NJWhiskeyHunter,8,Tue May 12 13:13:26 2015 UTC,The short version is that Uber announced they were coming here and started encouraging citizens to complain about the city's regulations before they made an attempt to work with city leaders. The city didn't take kindly to that and made new regulations that specifically mention rideshare apps. Those regulations are not favorable to Uber's business model so Uber took its ball and went home.   The good news is that there is a bill in the state house that would categorize rideshare services as different from taxis and wouldn't let cities impose their own fees or regulations on them.
Birmingham,35at51,willco17,2,Fri May 8 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"This is part of the narrative that really bugs me.  So Uber wanted to do business here.  They enlisted their local supporters to essentially lobby for them.  Isn't that kind of how it is supposed to work?  Citizens asking their city council for the things they need / want to make Birmingham a better place for them to live?  Let's look at the alternatives:   Uber calls the city council directly and tries to negotiate.  Doesn't that just smack of the same kind of back room corporate influence in government that people usually rail against?   Uber hires a lobbyist.  Now, this could certainly be more effective than option 1, maybe, but it's also kind of sleazy, IMHO.   All things considered, I'm quite OK with the way they did it.  Citizen engagement is always preferable, I think."
Birmingham,35at51,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Fri May 8 15:48:38 2015 UTC,"I seem to remember it starting out with a very negative slant. Like, Uber approached things as if they were under attack and launched a social media war before they had actually gone to the council to find a way for them to operate here.   It just doesn't seem like the most productive way to actually accomplish what they want and now we're living with it by not having Uber unless the state thing passes."
Birmingham,35at51,willco17,2,Fri May 8 20:28:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its hard to say exactly how it all kicked off.  I don't have any first hand knowledge of what, if any, communications happened between the city council and Uber before Uber asked their supporters to get involved."

Birmingham,35at51,mixduptransistor,8,Fri May 8 21:24:05 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  Long story short, Alabama politics are not known for being reasonable, understandable, or neutral. So most likely the reason why we don't have Uber is because someone either has stake in or has connections to a cab company or the cab industry in Birmingham, and has exerted their influence to keep out a highly successful direct competitor."

If you even do the bare minimum, like reading the newspaper and AL.com and watch local news, you can see what's going on. But we'll take it a step further. Have you attended a month of City Council meetings? Have you attempted to speak with a City Council member at any time and ask them about these issues (I mean in person, not just through calls and emails)?  When I worked in the news, it was very easy to get access to those persons and it was very easy to see who was full of crap.   In this particular issue, the news did a great job of exposing Rafferty's corruption in the matter.   And even if you can cite Uber for being unscrupulous themselves (which evidence says that they are,) you still have other services like Lyft which are also unavailable in town.  Now let's take things a step further - if the County Commission and City Council had any common sense, they'd cut spending on bullshit pet projects meant to buy goodwill votes and address the public transportation embarrassment that is the MAX bus system. They've got the vehicles and the routes, but they're notoriously unreliable, timed badly, and they break down frequently.   If the bus system in and around Birmingham could be reformed, we'd be in a position where we wouldn't really need taxis, Uber, or Lyft..."

The were always aweseom to deal with and super busy with bikes waiting to be looked at but knew their shit, and wayyy better priced than some of the other shops.

Let's say we want somebody with experience in A,  B, and C, so we list them as requirements. Now a person applies to our job, but they have skills A, B, and D. 9 times out of 10, HR will not send us that application because they do not meet our requirements.

Previously a hiring manager could request a specific application if they knew the name, regardless of whether or not they met 100% of the requirements.  Also, UAB takes it a little over the top by being so extremely strict with the requirements, or not understanding how different technical things might substitute, that it ends up filtering out qualified applicants.   It may have been after a discrimination lawsuit, I don't know. UAB got a new director of HR a few years ago and it got very corporatey very quickly."

Older house, covenient area, just me and the GF and I'm a working professional, no constant parties yet not out of the question.  I've been charging $400 flat for the room I rent in my house, and that includes the rent, utilities, and internet.  Do you think this is a fair price?  It's definitely less than half of the monthly bills."
Birmingham,3522c5,Nordoisthebest,1 point,Wed May 6 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"That's about what ours ends up being. Rent is split four ways, and then we use a website called Splitwise to easily split the utilities, but all said and done it ends up being between $375 and $400, depending on the utilities usage, so yeah, that sounds about right.

I just wanted to be sure others thought it was a fair price.

Birmingham,352rel,WarriorHealer,2,Thu May 7 16:34:41 2015 UTC,Honestly if you want the best seafood in Birmingham just drop the cash and go to Highlands.  While the menu changes daily there is always several different fresh gulf seafood dishes on the menu in addition to the oyster bar.  You may spend a little more money than other places but really it is about the same price as Ocean and Chucks and so much better than the Fish market.

Birmingham,352rel,derpderpdonkeypunch,2,Thu May 7 06:03:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is the answer. It's a very pricey 5 star but the only alternative is to go to Sextons and do it yourself.

I'm just surprised that he would get a split like that one for something as serious as armed robbery. I would have expected it to be something like 5/10 instead of 2/10.
Birmingham,34wh0g,Dapado,2,Tue May 5 18:19:17 2015 UTC,It's good. And a sentence like this man had that might seem light isn't too uncommon.

Birmingham,34rrbm,Kenobi13,5,Mon May 4 07:20:29 2015 UTC,"I remember a lot of the magic of that station was in Dave Rossi who was their program director. If I understood right he was the one that fostered such good relations with all those bands that made that station uniquely the X.   I remember going to see Cowboy Mouth around '09/'10 at Iron Horse. By then the X was a distant memory, but I had heard that Rossi was working at whatever alt. rock station was on the air at the time. I can't remember which was around then, but I think it's the one that just predates the Vulcan. (lord knows there's been like 4 or 4 since the X left) Anyway, I remember during the show lead singer/drummer Fred made a big shout out to Dave Rossi and that station he was working at at the time. I think that was a real good indication of the kind of guy he was.  Also, Beaner and Ken, what a couple of interesting guys they were. I always remember hearing stories of them and how they tended to be difficult to get along with others, especially Rick and Bubba once they started working in the same building. When I was in college I worked at a radio station in the town I was going to school in. There was a DJ there that had worked with Ken in another town many years before and when I mentioned growing up in Birmingham and listening to them, the DJ told me that Ken was the most immature, childish person he had ever worked with. Found that interesting especially in light of the stories I had heard before."

Birmingham,34rrbm,FalconHunter,5,Mon May 4 16:40:40 2015 UTC,"Birmingham Mountain Radio (107.3 FM) is, in large part, the leftovers from what made 107.7 great. Talked to Gino Pearson at Neon Electric about a year ago and more or less improv-interviewed him about BMR, the plans, and how it all happened.   In short, BMR was Reg, Gino and a few others getting together and trying to revitalize local radio in a way that 107.7 did 15+ years ago. And it's working.   As for what happened to the former 107.7 The X/100.5 folks:   Beaner and Ken did split (Beaner took that gig in DC and Ken remained in town.) Even when they tried to return with Beaner using ISDN to be a part of the show, it was still missing something. I encountered Ken Stone a few times and while he's a pretty good radio guy, he does live up to the negative stories that every tells. He tried to challenge me to a $100 game of pool at Brunswick on 280 one night. It was too rich for my blood at the time and I had to repeatedly decline the bet, but was still up for playing. We played, I won (nothing fancy) and he ribbed me about not taking the bet.  Mark Lindsey is still active in the industry around town. (Mark After Dark/Mark AD/Mark, the sideburn intern).  ""Hurricane Shane"" (not his real name I learned) still works at the Eagle last time I checked. Genuinely awesome guy - very gracious and the exact opposite of Ken Stone.  Luca - don't know what happened to her. She is actually originally from Cullman for any of those that still didn't know. The accent was all an act - again - this is likely common knowledge at this point.  Suzy Bo - Had a bit of an issue being a groupie with the acts that came through town. Insider info was that she was let go because she couldn't/wouldn't stop schtupping the bands.   Nate Dawg/Dog - was a manager at the now-closed music store in Brookwood Village. Not sure what he's doing today but I hear he's a family man and also working on other media projects. (Hearsay.)  Coyote Jay - No idea where he landed.  Reg - Reg's Coffee House continues on BMR presently.   Tuttle & Kline - Who cares. Although I heard Kline took a gig in Florida. These twerps belonged on 103.7 or some other baloney format. They were essentially the Douche-Rock all-stars that paralleled Rick & Bubba's Redneck Variety Show. I never met a pre-T&K 107.7 fan/listener that enjoyed their arrival or mourned their departure."
Birmingham,34rrbm,merely_mere,2,Mon May 4 16:59:34 2015 UTC,"Nathan is still married to Melissa, who he met when B&K set him up on a date on the radio show. They have a son and live in the 'burbs."

It is entirely possible for radio personalities to live in one location and broadcast on a station in another market. This can be done any number of ways, though in this case, I suspect it's just a pre-recorded couple of hours for filler to reduce talent costs.

But thanks for trying to tell me I'm wrong and that what I heard on the radio was some sort of mistake or fantasy.

Birmingham,34qokv,shinosa,20,Mon May 4 02:23:09 2015 UTC,"A lot of folks will wax about the low cost of living, the food, the outdoor activities, the warm winters, etc.  Those are all awesome, but you can find all of those things in any number of smaller southern cities.  You know what I love best about Birmingham?  It has an identity.  Birmingham has some shameful parts in its history, but today it is a place where frank, real conversations about that history can happen.  It is a place where we are aware of our past, but no longer feel defined or bound by it.  It is a place small enough for a tiny cabal of optimists to have a measurable impact.  It is a place that you can get to know intimately in a short time, but is diverse enough to stave off boredom for a long time.  It is a place full of passionate niches to explore.    Welcome, it's nice to have you in Birmingham!"
Birmingham,34qokv,DoItFoDaKids,7,Sun May 3 21:19:14 2015 UTC,Ok that was inspiring and now I feel like I've not made the best of being here. Time to fix that.

Ive made some great new friends talking up strangers at places where the vibe lends itself. 3. Pretty good affordability across the board, though it helps that I travel a lot to NYC for work and really appreciate prices back home. 4. Easy drive to almost any kind of outdoor activity. It's basically a city surrounded by forest. 5. Railroad Park and, more generally, the ongoing downtown revival. Such a different place than it was in the 90s, when I'd all but written off downtown. 6. If you have kids, the McWane Science Center, Art Museum and Bham Zoo are all excellent places. Also pretty good without kids.  You'll love it! Pm me if you guys have any specific questions."

I never feel rushed here and I feel like the entire city has such a small town feel and things here move in such a way that you can accomplish tons in one day maybe because the proximity to outdoor activities or how driving completely across down takes less than an hour...traffic doesn't eat your entire day. I was just in Nashville & while I like it for certain reasons - I was baffled at the traffic....I never ever feel that way about here. I just feel like the city itself is perfectly portioned. Not too trendy, not too boring...it's just the perfect mix. My answer sounds a little spacey but I just cannot put my love for this place into a nice package - because it's so unique and so abstract...it really is the magic city :)"

I feel like the food and urban renewal can be found in pretty much any good sized city in the country. since I'm new I'm still using atlanta as my measuring stick, birmingham is a little weak imo.  The two things I can hink of that I have found that make birmingham unique are the hill and the trees around the city. Makes the city look beautiful wherever you look and there are a couple bars that are open practically around the clock. ( I work 3rd shift sometimes so I love it)."

Birmingham,34qokv,waaaldooooo,5,Mon May 4 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"Food, beer, and music. There's world-class restaurants in town, like Highland Bar & Grill, as well as some of my favorite hole-in-the-wall type joints like T-Bone's and Saw's Soul Kitchen. We've got an ever growing number of microbreweries, my favorite of which is Avondale Brewing Company.   But the music scene here is amazing. Saturn, our newest venue, just opened up in Avondale, and it's probably one of, if not the, coolest venue I've ever been in. Plus, there's loads of great bands from right here in Birmingham."

You have a vast array of people and it seems we have a little bit of everything, and I mean everything, if you just look hard enough. I have a group of friends I've met through Reddit meetups, local shops, and events that have made my time in Birmingham absolutely wonderful.   I'm really without want in this city as it offers the positive aspect of a city and the positive aspects of a town as it it really is a small city."

I live in Vestavia and I can get to most points in the metro area in about 15-20 minutes.  Want to head to the symphony? 15 minutes.  Want to go to the zoo?  10 minutes.  Botanical gardens(there are two)? 15 minutes.  BJCC for a concert? 20 minutes.  This will not be your life if you live down 280. You've been warned.  Plus you really aren't l that far from actual wilderness activities like hiking, climbing or canoeing.  And if you like to hunt, you are in the right place.  Golf 12 months of the year.  Tennis too."

Birmingham,34qokv,XaviLi,3,Mon May 4 04:06:34 2015 UTC,"I love sitting on our deck here on the north face of Red Mountain and listening to the city breathe. In our quiet little corner of Southside, the birdsong almost drowns out the constant murmur of traffic. Trains rumble by to the west. Sometimes jets roar by overhead, wheeling around to make their approach into Shuttlesworth International. Helicopters trundle about, traffic copters darting along the city's arteries, medivac choppers touching down atop UAB and Children's hospitals. I hear trucks honking their horns, emergency vehicles blooping their sirens, the occasional crash and tinkle of a car accident. But for all the sounds of the city, our street is peaceful. Neighbors walk their dogs. The kids across the street play backyard stickball and tag. A creaky screen door announces that the guy two doors down the alley is sneaking out onto his back porch for a cigarette. Sometimes at night fireworks bloom over The Club. We're close enough to hear them snap and sizzle. It sets off all the dogs, a great yapping panicky chorus that cascades down the mountainside.  I can sit on our deck for hours, just letting the sounds of the city wash over me.   I guess lots of people in lots of different cities can share similar stories. But this story is mine, and it's about Birmingham. I don't want to live anywhere else. I like my shitty shambles of an apartment building. I love the people who live here. I love the location, ten minutes from anywhere by car, thirty or forty minutes from anywhere on foot.  But mostly, I love sitting on my deck.  EDIT: a word"

BWW does it on Saturdays now but I haven't been since they moved it.  Meanwhile, Rojo does it on Wednesdays, Stillwater does it on Mondays, the various On Taps do it on different days, etc.  My point was that you asked for trivia places and they're easy to find. If you're looking for people to play with or a specific neighborhood or day of the week, you need to be more specific. A cursory google search answers your question, which is why I responded that way."

I asked the guy on 1st shift and was told the same thing.  None of us had any idea how long the food had been there.

Anywho, i know of several groups of bike riders who go from homewood to Irondale, so assuming 45min on a bike isnt bad for you....there is a pretty good one off of grants mill road in irondale, right past where it intersects with overton...also one near the zamora temple shrine.   Grants mill has a rope swing too, or used to."

So, swimming in the upper Cahaba watershed (the urbanized part) may not be a great idea until we make more progress cleaning it up."

I do agree with you that it is shameful the way AL.com has treated Mr. Kennedy.  Even worse is the way they have devolved into just another clickbait ""news"" site.  Good journalism has a big role to play in holding the powerful to account in this city, and AL.com is not living up to their potential.

Nevermind  the wasted time that goes into the troll-fest in the comments, the actual premise that the problem is specific to al.com and not a larger pattern of behaviour and by-product of a poor system design is what I personally find most interesting about this dialog. The fact that content-publishers and once-great content producers have to result to clickbait in 2015 to get your attention shouldn't come as a shock to anyone."

Birmingham,34lmaj,UABSamurai,8,Sat May 2 06:26:47 2015 UTC,"You should not base your safety opinions on one isolated incident. Shit happens everywhere occasionally. Think about the number of people who file through Railroad Park and Regions Field on a regular basis and the fact that there has only been one incident like that since it all opened. The chances of you being a victim are insanely low. Plus, in that incident it was a bunch of kids hanging around in a group, so if you weren't part of that group you wouldn't have been impacted anyway (as is the case with most crime---if you aren't hanging around with gang members or dealing drugs in the alleys of Gate City or otherwise running with that type of crowd your chances are extremely low)  And on the flip side someone got robbed at gunpoint in Mountain Brook last week, but people aren't going to stop going over there or move out of their million dollar houses."

Birmingham,34kldb,saarlac,2,Sat May 2 18:52:47 2015 UTC,Well they have live action GPS so they will know if you went on a sidewalk which is illegal is most places from what I hear. The current plan is to release the bike share first then track where people are commonly going so then they present the city with Bike lane plans.
Birmingham,34kldb,sealedHuman,0,Sat May 2 20:33:14 2015 UTC,Yeah no. GPS is not accurate enough to tell if you're on a sidewalk vs the road.
Birmingham,34kldb,skarulid,1 point,Sun May 10 16:12:42 2015 UTC,It can be. It just depends on the quality of signal the receiver is getting. Honestly though in the city it probably won't be any more accurate than a 20 to 50 foot radius. That's good enough to figure out what road you're on but probably not for sidewalk vs road.

Birmingham,34jeyv,sealedHuman,7,Fri May 1 17:39:41 2015 UTC,"I have a bit of experience with bike share programs. I was at Montevallo when they brought in the first bike share in the state. I also dealt with the program a decent bit when I interned in DC.  My experience in Montevallo was mostly positive. People used the bikes to get to the grocery store half a mile away, the McDonalds on the other side of campus, and to sporting events. The program wasn't huge but neither was the demand. Montevallo has zero bike lanes but very little car or pedestrian traffic. No real negatives to the program from what I could tell.  The program in DC was different. The main bike users were tourists and apparently many had never ridden bikes in an urban area before; they could never figure out if they were supposed to be in the road, the sidewalk, with traffic, against traffic, or right down the middle of the road. It was frustrating even as a pedestrian.   My worry for our program is that we will share DC's problem. Also, considering how those mass bike rides on Thursday nights encourage bicyclists to ignore traffic laws, I worry about safety. Regardless, I am excited for the program to start. It's a big step in the right direction."
Birmingham,34jeyv,tackyjacks,3,Fri May 1 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"Is the Thursday night thing the Redemptive ride?  I've ridden with the Tuesday night ""Tour de Ham"" group and they seem to obey all traffic laws.  They stop at lights, mostly signal (as often as drivers do around here, anyway), stay in a lane, and use calls up the ride to indicate cars coming, etc.  They stop a few times during the ride to let the folks that may have been split off at a red light or something catch up and rejoin the group.  It's a lot of fun."
Birmingham,34jeyv,NJWhiskeyHunter,5,Fri May 1 19:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Thursday night is the Redemptive group. They all seem like they're having a blast, but they have seem to have a habit of taking up two full lanes so no cars can pass, running red lights, standing in front of cars at stop signs and red lights so their entire group of 50-ish can bike past at once, and generally acting like the roads are for their use only. It's a shame because the organization seems very cool. Hopefully I've just caught them on bad nights."

Because Critical Mass takes place without an official route or sanction, participants practice a tactic known as ""corking"" in order to maintain the cohesion of the group. This tactic consists of a few riders blocking traffic from side roads so that the mass can freely proceed through red lights without interruption. Corking allows the  mass to engage in a variety of activities, such as circling in an intersection, or lifting their bikes in a tradition known as a Chicago hold-up. The 'Corks' sometimes take advantage of their time corking to distribute flyers.

I know we sometimes anger drivers, but that is not our intention and it's not something we enjoy doing.   Maintaining a cohesive unit via corking intersections is simply the safest way to do group rides, and we're still actively improving these rides to run more smoothly - we have designated corkers/ride leaders, and we have begun making safety announcements before the rides to encourage everyone to ride safetly and courteously.   These group ride tactics are only applicable to large group rides, not  solo riders or small groups, and we aren't trying to advocate for lawlessness or cyclists owning the roads - sorry if it seems that way."
Birmingham,34jeyv,redemptivecycles,6,Fri May 1 20:53:15 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely pro-bike, especially in downtown areas where it is a great option for getting around.  The thing is, some of these tactics really anger the community as a whole.  These are the same people whose support we need for things like bikesharing, dedicated lanes, more trail infrastructure, etc.  It's a tricky thing, making a safe group ride without pissing off the rest of the people on the road so much that they dig in and oppose any bike friendly change."

Birmingham,34fsf5,nevermindjosh,7,Thu Apr 30 19:55:00 2015 UTC,"I have been so inactive on reddit lately, but lucky you, I stumbled here today! haha  I lived in a two bedroom for a year and a half as a renter, and I know 3 people that own in the complex. Two own updated one bedroom units with patios (one of them gutted hers completely and it's incredibly well-decorated now), one owns a fairly bare bones one bedroom upstairs unit with no patio.  I adored it. I love the way it's set up and the private outdoor patio (if you get one, which I definitely think you should do everything in your power to get one with a patio).   The stairwell in Row D turns into an absolute waterfall in the rain, though. In a couple of torrential downpours our patio actually flooded, but I think it was a draining issue that they fixed for our particular unit. The realty people are a little old school but they are responsive to repair requests.  It's fairly quiet. I liked all my neighbors even if some were a little eccentric (the dude with a MILLION PLANTS, ahaha, but hey, at least the plants are pretty).   I really dug it! 8/10 would live there again."

Birmingham,34eum1,DriveByBBQ,2,Thu Apr 30 16:51:03 2015 UTC,"I contacted them a few years ago when I was on the job hunt. I wanted to give back but also saw it as a way to fill my time and it's a hell of an interview answer if potential employers ask ""What have you been up to?"" They were very friendly and helpful but fortunately, or unfortunately, I landed a job before my start date."
Birmingham,34eum1,kdennis,2,Thu Apr 30 17:01:27 2015 UTC,"I will definitely be looking further into this organization. I'm definitely interested in making 'what I've been up to' both beneficial and worthwhile. Thanks again, and grats on landing a good job."

Birmingham,34f3vr,tayloml4,6,Thu Apr 30 16:56:06 2015 UTC,State Farm is the best. Farmers is one of the worst. Farm.

Birmingham,34f3vr,lungpaste,2,Thu Apr 30 18:55:54 2015 UTC,Ameriprise. Have the exact same amount of coverage I had with Farmers for less than half the cost I was paying before. They've been great. Added discount if you're a Costco member.
Birmingham,34f3vr,lemonhighfives,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:21:00 2015 UTC,I just dropped progressive  and shopped around for home and auto. I ended up going with State Farm. Great small town feel witb great coverage and good rates. I guess it all depends on if you want to plan for the unexpected or bet that you never have to use it. I've never been in an accident  but want to be covered in case something happens
Birmingham,34f3vr,v6stang07,1 point,Fri May 1 01:21:14 2015 UTC,Liberty Mutual has been amazing for us.
Birmingham,34f3vr,malloryhair,-2,Fri May 1 04:23:40 2015 UTC,I use Good 2 Go because they are quite cheap. Insurance is insurance really and it only matters when you get in an accident . . . however when you do they all screw you over in one way or another so I think insurance really becomes what is the least expensive to screw you over.  https://www.good2go.com/

Birmingham,34eqxa,frostxxfire,1 point,Fri May 1 17:27:35 2015 UTC,2:30-3:00 would be perfect for my Shiba Inu and I. I get off work at 2:00 and that gives me just enough time to drive down there. I haven't been there in a long time. Is this the park where you have to bring your own water or am I thinking of a different one?
Birmingham,34eqxa,tackyjacks,1 point,Fri May 1 20:12:59 2015 UTC,"There's a creek next to the park, but no fountain or bowls. So, kinda?"

Birmingham,34br6s,shredphones,11,Thu Apr 30 04:43:38 2015 UTC,Many young people come to birmingham thinking this will be a temporary stop.   Most of them stay well past what they intended.  I love this city.
Birmingham,34br6s,akci,5,Thu Apr 30 01:59:09 2015 UTC,"We get alot of crap in the South for basically our geographical location and culture, but half the people (of several races) I know have come from the west coast or northeast and have STAYED because they love it here.  Birmingham is a good city, and it's becoming a great city."
Birmingham,34br6s,64voxac30,6,Thu Apr 30 12:11:37 2015 UTC,"While that is mostly true, Birmingham needs to get its school system and public transportation in order, both of which are in piss-poor shape. Having great entertainment scene is just one of many pillars that hold up a ""great"" city."
Birmingham,34br6s,Zaphod1620,2,Thu Apr 30 12:22:08 2015 UTC,"The schools are going to be the big one, I think.  Young professionals will come here, but when they have kids they are going to start eyeballing either OTM communities or other cities if we don't get Birmingham's school system sorted out."
Birmingham,34br6s,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Thu Apr 30 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"There's still so much work to do with the schools. But I see signs of hope. Avondale Elementary is starting to turn around, and many of my peers are starting to consider sending their children there rather than move over the mountain.  Also, I'm hopeful the addition of charter schools will provide viable alternatives to the poor Birmingham City school system."
Birmingham,34br6s,caldwellesq,2,Thu Apr 30 15:02:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed!  There are a lot of reasons to be hopeful.  Woodlawn is another example.  There has been a lot of outside interest in helping them fix their school system lately.  For example, there's a big partnership between Woodlawn schools and the Jones Valley teaching farm now.  Positive steps :-)"
Birmingham,34br6s,NJWhiskeyHunter,0,Thu Apr 30 15:19:05 2015 UTC,"You realize Woodlawn doesn't have their own school system, right? Any systematic attempt to improve their schools would have to apply to the entire city."
Birmingham,34br6s,CancerX,1 point,Sun May 3 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are part of bham city schools IIRC, and that has exactly what to do with anything?  Is Jones Valley not partnering with schools in Woodlawn?"
Birmingham,34br6s,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Sun May 3 14:32:50 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more!  After graduating from college, my wife and I decided it was in our best professional interest to move to a larger city with a higher demand for accountants and developers.  We moved here figuring that we'd put in a couple of years in industry before moving on to 'where we want to be' - that was in 2007 and we've since realized that, at least for now, we're already 'where we want to be'.  It really is a great city with a lot to offer most everyone from any walk of life...  except the 'I hate good food, drink, music and awesome activities' walk of life..."
Birmingham,34br6s,mattezell,3,Thu Apr 30 12:29:24 2015 UTC,"We left Birmingham for the same reason, better jobs, better schooling opportunities.  After a decade away we came back to be closer to family and I don't see us leaving any time soon.  Birmingham is ascendant.  Not perfect, but definitely a city on the rise.  If one of you is a developer, that's even better as you can find remote work opportunities and get the best of both worlds:  A west coast salary and an Alabama cost of living :-)"

Birmingham,34br6s,mattezell,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:45:29 2015 UTC,Demand for accountants? Where? I'm tired of commuting to Montgomery.
Birmingham,34br6s,tuffy11111,0,Fri May 1 03:23:58 2015 UTC,"My secondhand exposure to her trade has lead me to believe that there are a lot of large firms here frequently hiring smart people to distribute the client workload to (how she got started when we moved here) ...   I've also gathered that there's a ton of industry here looking for skilled and experienced resources to hire on in order to bring some work back in-house (what she later transitioned to)...   This all said, my wife is pretty freaking awesome... Not sure how that's factored into things, though I am sure it factors... It always factors... Similarly, I am not saying you're not awesome or awesome to a lesser extent... I simply have no direct exposure to your degree of awesomeness to establish a base for a scale...  Awesomeness aside.. through her and her professional associations, I've come away with the impression that there is quite a market for accountants in the area.. After all, we do have a lot of fortune 500 operations here, lots of banking companies, lots of insurance companies,  not to mention the local misc industry...  All of which requires someone to count their beans for them..."

Some of these things are almost the size of a manhole and might as well be as deep regarding your alignment.
Birmingham,349spy,enoughsoap,3,Wed Apr 29 15:16:02 2015 UTC,Yea I've seen some huge ones pop up recently. The thing that I don't get is that they can appear practically overnight... Where the fuck does all the concrete go?

Birmingham,348nck,ilyenia,10,Wed Apr 29 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"Birmingham is in dire need of a taxi alternative.    We will never be seen seriously unless either the taxi system is cleaned up, or we get a ride share.    Have you ever tried to get a taxi from the airport on a weekend? Hint: you can't. Or if you do, you have to wait three hours. It's embarrassing for this city."
Birmingham,348nck,varnecr,8,Wed Apr 29 13:26:47 2015 UTC,"Yellow Cab is absolutely horrible. The few times I've attempted to get a ride to/from the airport has been painful, whether reserving online or calling directly. I have had a couple of good experiences with Silver Cab, as the gentleman driving was friendly, ran his meter for the entire duration and did not gripe when I extended my credit card as payment.  With that said, Uber is just a much better experience and beneficial for the consumer. All the major cities in the states have Uber...if B'ham wants to continue to progress and get on the map Uber will be coming around eventually. Why delay the inevitable?"
Birmingham,348nck,roboticarm,2,Wed Apr 29 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"Crestwood has its own airport taxi service now because of how bad taxi service is in Birmingham. And it's just a guy who, after hearing horror story after horror story, decided to meet the need himself. Yes, it's technically illegal, but that's what happens when power structures fail and people have no reasonable alternative."
Birmingham,348nck,NJWhiskeyHunter,8,Wed Apr 29 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"I used AL.com's headline but they really blew it by not saying ""pave the way"" instead of open the door.   Edit: typo"
Birmingham,348nck,James_LeFleur,7,Wed Apr 29 13:54:33 2015 UTC,"I'm so on the fence about this.  On the one hand, our taxi system is broken.  Our city council blew it with the last round of transportation regulations.  We need Uber / Lyft here.  We also need regulations for these types of services at a regional / state level instead of a city level.  In order to really work, an Uber driver needs to be able to know the laws are consistent in a pretty big area.  If the driver can't pick somebody up in Birmingam, take them to Hoover, pick up another fare in Hoover that is headed downtown and come back, then the efficiencies that make ride share services work will break down.  If I'm reading the law correctly this is how cabs work today.  A cab driver licensed in Birmingham could take somebody to Montgomery, but they couldn't pick up a fare in Montgomery headed back to Birmingham.  They would have to make that drive empty, costing them fuel and time (read: money).  Super inefficient.  Bad for the driver, bad for the people, bad for the environment.  On the other hand, the PSC is run by people so stupid I don't even have the right words to describe them, and I generally prefer local control to state level control over what happens in Bham.  So yeah, this isn't black and white.  Maybe the best case scenario is that the threat of the PSC involvement gets the cities to reconsider their positions and work out some arrangement.  Preferably one that includes reciprocity in their regulations, so a driver legally working in one city can pick up fares from another."
Birmingham,348nck,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:42:14 2015 UTC,Maybe rideshare companies don't need any regulation and the consumer can decide for himself if getting in an Uber is a good idea or not.
Birmingham,348nck,THROBBINGRED,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:49:06 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'd still favor some regulation, but it needs to be a much lighter touch than what we have today.  For example, background checks, a vehicle quality requirement (either require newer cars or inspections of older vehicles), etc."
Birmingham,348nck,jnthnadams,7,Thu Apr 30 14:18:50 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify-- someone (um... Uber, obviously) has drafted similar legislation in ""problem"" states:   Arkansas Kansas Utah South Carolina New York Plus a whole bunch of others... Hawaii, North Dakota, blah blah blah...   I'm guessing that Uber is thinking that it is much easier to lobby/leverage a state board or regulatory committee as opposed to having to maintain dedicated governmental relations on a municipality level.  The whole ""only the state can leverage taxes on TNC's"" is pretty dang advantageous.  That being said, I still want this to pass."
Birmingham,348nck,Nordoisthebest,3,Wed Apr 29 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"I can't even count the times I needed an Uber here. If the other cities in the country can have this service, why can't we?"
Birmingham,348nck,NJWhiskeyHunter,4,Wed Apr 29 15:59:44 2015 UTC,Honest answer: Uber is notoriously sharp elbowed when muscling into cities. They do not attempt to sit down with cities they demand bills that favor them to be passed.
Birmingham,348nck,typie312,2,Wed Apr 29 22:54:41 2015 UTC,There is so much wrong with that statement.
Birmingham,348nck,James_LeFleur,2,Thu Apr 30 01:18:44 2015 UTC,Will uber be good for birmingham's transportation system?  Seems to me like it would hurt the transportation system vs the new buses.
Birmingham,348nck,typie312,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:19:10 2015 UTC,"It's completely different. If you are at a bar in Uptown on your second drink and you are deciding whether to keep drinking and move to a bar in Lakeview you aren't going to consider taking a bus. You are either going to drink and drive or stop drinking and go home and not spend more money in Bham. Uber will be most popular for bars, going to and from events, and getting rides from the airport. It's too expensive to use it like you would a bus and I doubt many bus riders will start using Uber."
Birmingham,348nck,WarriorHealer,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"It makes sense.  I worry about speculation and try to think of the cons of everything.  Last time I flew into the airport, there were a lot of taxi drivers waiting to give me a ride out.  I ended up tipping the guy more than what I usually do, because of how cheap he was.  I am more bothered by the number of cars on the road in B'ham around rush hour, and I know taxis usually just wait around bars and clubs to give people rides."

Birmingham,348nck,mixduptransistor,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:13:38 2015 UTC,I haven't downvoted you.   It seems like this bill is pretty fair. I'm not sure how the PSC could mess it up since all they'd be doing is collecting one annual fee from Uber and making sure drivers get inspections. I don't want to underestimate their stupidity though.   Their issue is that they're usually way too pro-business but I'm just not seeing how the consumer is harmed this time.
Birmingham,348nck,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:49:59 2015 UTC,oh I was just referring to the 4 downvotes I got in general.  The PSC is terribly corrupt. They rubber stamp every price increase Alabama Power asks for and are in the pocket of the coal industry.

He has a truly big heart, a passion for his work, a love for his family and faith, and best of all, a filthy mind when the appropriate company is around! (Though he has class when he expresses it.)   He's was a wonderful mentor to the interns, the new arrivals, and even the vets. He was nearly always on duty, often hearing about breaking news from any number of his many contacts over the years and using his ""off time"" to make the station aware of or cover breaking news. (we got exclusive video of a high profile perp walk this way once.)   When MediaGeneral bought WVTM from NBC, they laid many of us off. Mike came to the going away party and made sure to interact with each and every person - from the new faces to the vets who'd been in the biz longer than he. He was encouraging, uplifting, and patriarchal.   I'd wager that he's been eyeing retirement for a few years; Hearst acquiring WVTM was probably just perfect timing for that exit. He's expensive and I doubt Hearst can afford to re-sign him with all of the other rebuilding efforts they're facing - MediaGeneral all but destroyed WVTM..."

He and the 10p producer had a difference of opinion and were yelling back and forth at each other in the newsroom. This was when there was a newsroom anchor desk that was used from time to time. He was sitting there, aircheck tape rolling, her in the background at her desk, blasting her in the most un-Royer manner that I've ever seen. Of course, she's firing back, giving as good as she gets, verbally.   I may be mistaken, but I think they were on standby because a sports event or live event ran late, which is why the aircheck was rolling on the whole thing."

You know; black, white, Asian, american, European, man woman or child....  To the best of my remembrance I've never heard any specific racist comments from them. Yeah, they've made fun of other races, but they make fun of all races.   Any chance you could source that accusation? You've gotten me curious."

I don't understand why just because a black person is being made fun of, in this case, or more generally when somebody of one race makes a joke or pokes fun at a person of another race it HAS to be racism. And racism and stereotyping are very separate things. There's stereotypes that jocks are dumb. But it never specifies race. If it's general making fun of someone, or mockery, or anything, it's sometimes not a racial issue until somebody comes along and yells ""That's racist!""  I acknowledge that racism is alive and well all over the world, but it's not the ruling school of thought every time somebody cracks a joke."

Birmingham,34746j,Cardnil,9,Tue Apr 28 20:48:21 2015 UTC,Would you care to explain why is improving public transportation dumb?
Birmingham,34746j,l72,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:45:16 2015 UTC,Improving public transportation would be great!  But a 15-mile light rail project would cost $1 billion just to construct.  You could overhaul the entire bus system citywide for much less.
Birmingham,34746j,l72,4,Tue Apr 28 23:58:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that light rail isn't the cheapest solution, which is why I am in favor of BRT (Bus Rapid Transit). When done correctly it has almost all the benefits of light rail at a fraction of the cost. It's biggest downfall is that it isn't a train, and for some reason, in many cities including Birmingham, there is a perception different between getting on a bus and getting on a train.  However, for BRT to work, it MUST be done right. This means dedicated lanes, priority signals, express routes, and FIXED STATIONS with platform boarding.   The fixed stations are important since it tends to spur a lot of development since developers know the transit station is permanent, unlike a bus stop.  Here's a good flyer about BRT:  https://www.metroplanning.org/uploads/cms/documents/MPC_FactSheet_BRT_2011_11_web.pdf  Also, it is possible to build a BRT that looks like a train, which helps with the perception issues:  http://www.nashvillescene.com/imager/a-messy-fight-looms-over-the-amp-metros-proposed-bus-rapid-transit-system/b/original/3954937/691b/coverstory1-4.jpg  And of course, all of this should be tied into an overhaul of our existing bus system. The hub and spoke model must go and should turn into a grid system. This usually means additional transfers, but it means less average wait time and more mobility.  I'm expecting the BJCTA to make an announcement of a BRT proposed east-west line, connecting the airport and eastern neighborhoods to downtown and then connecting on to 5 points west and the cross plex. This will be VERY important for the World Games."
Birmingham,34746j,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:08:54 2015 UTC,"Dedicated Lanes aren't really needed though, the same desired effect could be created by making Bus/Carpool lanes like how Seattle has done it. They even made the speed in those lanes 10 mph more than the rest to incentivize people to take the bus and/or carpool.  If Birmingham was to adopt that approach I think it would help in both efficiency and traffic by getting people carpool more and drive less."
Birmingham,34746j,jnthnadams,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:56:38 2015 UTC,"If you put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig. Not saying BRT is a bad idea, but it's not enough for people to ditch their preconceived notions.  That's all."
Birmingham,34746j,jnthnadams,0,Thu Apr 30 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"They are working on it, based on what I've heard.  However, as you pointed out, BRT needs dedicated lanes and fixed stations. From what I've heard, there will be signal priority and express routes but no dedicated lanes and fixed stations.  Right idea, but the execution will likely not be there. The BJCTA is looked over a lot when blame is cast for Birmingham's sub-par transit."
Birmingham,34746j,MichaelTunnell,2,Wed Apr 29 21:04:20 2015 UTC,"At least in Birmingham, middle- and upper-class people don't use the bus system. On the other hand, when I've been to cities with trains and subway systems, it seems like everyone is comfortable using them.  I think the big plus for trains/subways is that they're immune to traffic. There really isn't any incentive to use the bus if you're looking to quickly get from point A to point B."

Birmingham,343i3y,mandirae,3,Tue Apr 28 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"Well there was a big fuss about no-reentry when the tickets were first released. After some backlash the organizers relented and now are allowing a single-reentry per day as long as it is before 7pm. So if you are planning on having your bar open and no private events you could advertise something along the lines of ""Single re-entry? Better make it count!"" or ""Our A/C doesn't require VIP"" on the roadside (the VIP tickets at sloss are like an extra $200 for access to A/C tents)."

Birmingham,340yuj,fireside_chats,16,Mon Apr 27 13:14:55 2015 UTC,"Gardendale & Fultondale would suit you well.  They are both safe communities, mainly consisting of families.  Any of the suburbs, including these two, around Birmingham will consist of people with very conservative values for the most part so be ready for that if you're not used it.  Both of these suburbs are growing and have all of your major chain restaurants and shopping outlets.  They are at most a 30 minute drive from Hoover & 280 where additional shopping exists.   Neither of these suburbs have much in the way of bars or night-life so if that is important to you then look elsewhere (Downtown).  If family values, safe living, and general affordability are most important then Gardendale or Fultondale will be great."
Birmingham,340yuj,justint420,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you! The more I read, the more I think Gardendale is probably going to fit the bill. We are not worried about it being more conservative, or sterile. We're fairly low key people to begin with, and at this point in our lives we're really just looking for a nice home in a safe area. We can always drive in to Birmingham if we need some excitement."
Birmingham,340yuj,shotgun72,6,Tue Apr 28 15:40:20 2015 UTC,"Yea, Fultondale/Gardendale complex is your best bet.  Community is pretty sterile, lots of holier than thou types and diversity means having Country AND Western, but property value holds up pretty good."

Gardendale is a fuzz nicer in all respects, but less rural overall."
Birmingham,340yuj,wrigh003,2,Mon Apr 27 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"For what it is worth, my aunt and uncle have lived there as long as I can remember (I am 26).  I believe that the most trouble they have ever had was a pesky raccoon that kept eating their cat's food.  Essentially, it's a nice, family oriented suburb.  Edit:  forgot a word."
Birmingham,340yuj,Robotseatguitar,2,Tue Apr 28 00:06:01 2015 UTC,"You could look in Smoke Rise. It's an unincorporated part of extreme western Blount County, just over the jefferson county line- I live there. It's :25-30 to downtown Birmingham on days when traffic cooperates, usually :40 to Brookwood where I work now. It's an easy commute but long, and it'll wear on a car and pile up the highway miles (you'll want a comfy 4cylinder sedan made for gas mileage...), but it's all usually pretty painless.  Pros- Property values are low and you can get lots of house and/or acreage for your money. In Smoke Rise proper, by covenant all lots are at least an acre, so you won't have neighbors right on top of you. Schools are OK, for the most part, which although it doesn't matter to you, per se, also helps make the community a decent place to be. Hayden is another community right there off 65, though it's a little further over on AL Hwy 160.  Cons: Diversity means there are a couple of different Baptist churches to pick from. There are some bumpkins around, but not really noticeably more than anywhere else in this part of the world. Grocery shopping means a car ride and the closest one is the Piggly Wiggly in Warrior- it suuuucks. Publix in Gardendale is much nicer, and if you can stand it and/or need junk from Wal Mart, those are both a :15 ride away.  If that all sounds OK, look for houses close to I65 exits 284 and 287. I were looking to live here, now, I'd look in/around Gardendale and Fultondale instead, though. Gets you those :15-20 closer to Birmingham for weekend/evening fun in the city, makes the commute over to Tuscaloosa area little more bearable, puts you closer to decent groceries, banks, community stuff, parks, etc. Besides- the drive to Huntsville from there is wicked easy. Keep an eye peeled for the fuzz, then set the cruise at 84 or so and boogie down.  There's my take. Shoot me a PM if you want more info- I know a realtor I can put you in touch with if you're interested in a read on the west Blount/ Smoke Rise deal, etc."
Birmingham,340yuj,malloryhair,2,Tue Apr 28 00:34:36 2015 UTC,"I live in Mt. Olive (north of G'dale), and I love it. It's quiet and accessible to pretty much anywhere you want to go as it's right off the highway. Gardendale is a nice city as well, and they are slowly getting more and more good stores and restaurants. Prior to moving to Mt. Olive, we were in Fultondale, and it was equally nice. A little more run down in some parts, but they are slowly building up as well. Good luck on your move."
Birmingham,340yuj,dreed18,3,Thu Apr 30 03:35:08 2015 UTC,"Crestwood! The neighborhood is blowing up right now, and since schools aren't a priority the neighborhood is perfect for you! Super hip & a great warm community - Lots of young people, close to downtown, and your investment will pay off. It's close to I-20 which intersects 65 or you can take back roads to 65 to avoid traffic. :)"

Birmingham,340yuj,waaaldooooo,3,Mon Apr 27 17:14:33 2015 UTC,Nnnoooo it's a neighborhood of Birmingham city proper.
Birmingham,340yuj,daddyfatsax,3,Mon Apr 27 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"Crestwood is great, but it's not north of Birmingham, it is Birmingham.  Definitely shorter drive to Tuscaloosa than Huntsville."

Birmingham,340yuj,degaman,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"Gardendale is the major spot north of the city. The biggest thing going on there is the Gardendale First Baptist Church, and it is one of the most conservative areas in a conservative state, so be down with that.   The communities surrounding Gardendale are similar, but if you want your kids in the public schools, you ought to know that Gardendale is in the process of pulling out of Jefferson County Schools and creating its own city school system.   What this means is that Gardendale will be taking with them Gardendale High School, a ~$50 million public high school built by Jefferson County Schools in about 2010 -- it is one of the newest and most cutting edge schools in the area. But if you're not in Gardendale city limits, it is unlikely -- at this time, anyway -- that you'll have an equivalent facility to Gardendale High School for your kids in Jefferson County schools.   That could also negatively affect property values in the communities surrounding Gardendale."

Birmingham,340yuj,datraceman,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:05:25 2015 UTC,"I thought about this to some extent. I gave the scenario of every other week as an easy explanation.

Birmingham,340yuj,RentMonster,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:20:02 2015 UTC,I don't know much about gardendale or areas north of downtown. You might want to consider bluff park though. It's in your price range and it is very convenient to 65. Good luck!
Birmingham,340yuj,WarriorHealer,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:38:21 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Birmingham,340yuj,WarriorHealer,13,Mon Apr 27 13:48:00 2015 UTC,"Such lies....this is not north of the city. Getting out of Bluff Park is a nightmare at rush hour do not listen to this person.   If you want to live north of the city, Gardendale or Warrior is your best bet. You're about 1 hour 15 minutes to Huntsville and about the same to Tuscaloosa.   Gardendale has some really nice suburban homes that are newer that are in the $175k to $225k range. If you stay on the western side it's newer and cheaper. The eastern side of Gardendale is a bit older so there are some deals to be had but some of the neighborhoods can be a bit white trashy in spots.   Best bet if you live on the east side is to walk around the nearby parks and check out the neighborhood.   From a shopping perspective, there's a Publix, a Target, etc. at one of the two main Gardendale exits.  If you want more rural land (and it is cheaper), add 15 more minutes to your commute and Warrior is easily attainable at $200k.  EDIT: You're also less than 15 minutes from downtown Birmingham where great restaurants, minor league baseball, etc. are everywhere."
Birmingham,340yuj,Yiggly64,-1,Mon Apr 27 13:54:18 2015 UTC,I didn't say it was north of the city. I live there and I find it convenient.
Birmingham,340yuj,WarriorHealer,4,Mon Apr 27 14:02:41 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but he specifically asked about north of the city. I apologize if my first line was a bit harsh in my post.   I get a bit defensive here and there on this sub because some people keep trying to get people to live in Avondale or in the Loft District which is great if that is where you want to live. However, some people don't want to live downtown, which is fine.   I apologize again. Looking at your post a second time, you were just passing along information."
Birmingham,340yuj,WarriorHealer,3,Mon Apr 27 14:35:16 2015 UTC,No worries guys. I knew that Bluff Park probably wouldn't work too well once I looked it up.   I just appreciated the help either way.
Birmingham,340yuj,willco17,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:53:49 2015 UTC,"Gardendale and Fultondale are both very nice cities. I've lived in both, in fact I grew up in Fultondale.  I would say they both have great places and great value but the best part is they are basically just 5 minutes apart for the main strips of the cities so either one you choose will provide you will access to both city benefits.  Another great thing is the fact they are both about 15 minutes from Birmingham proper so if you want to go to Birmingham it is quite reasonable drive.

I've visited a number of times, and if I could live anywhere it would be within walking distance of Saw's in Homewood.   North of Birmingham is just what the compromise has to be given the amount of travel we're going to have to do. If my wife ended up with a 2 hour average drive and I ended up with a 45 minute average drive, then she'd likely get unhappy pretty quickly.

Both places let you grill it on the table and provide a ton of banchan. Seoul also offers bbq, but is not worth a trip. Awful."
Birmingham,33zkdy,littlefacemcgoo,7,Tue Apr 28 03:25:13 2015 UTC,Red Bowl is the only place in town that cooks bulgolgi on a grill top so that it gets a legit char. Everywhere else will give you sauteed wet bulgolgi.

Charter wouldn't allow me to use my own modem though and they called me 5 Times asking why I didn't get cable TV from them.

That's two football coaches making 62% of what all superintendents combined make. And we're really saying it's the superintendents that are overpaid?  This isn't an anti-football rant, but before you get all hot and bothered about someone's salary, maybe try to put it into context."

Birmingham,33tis8,auburnff,-5,Sat Apr 25 18:29:47 2015 UTC,Last time I checked Alabama and Auburn were part of Alabama's education system. Why aren't you getting hot and bothered about coach salaries?
Birmingham,33tis8,dyslexda,4,Sat Apr 25 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"1) College football programs at UA and AU are self-sustaining. Therefore your argument is invalid.   2) Perhaps we should pay superintendents the same salary as the teachers. A failing school shouldn't have it's funding pulled. The people who are making the decisions for that school should have their salary pulled. But this line of thinking only serves to provoke more arguments, not seek solutions.   3) I think you are taking my opposition to a bloated administrative staff as somehow a lessening of their intentions; this is not the case. I'm arguing that there is an inherent lunacy in the entire idea of paying $17.3M a year to 132 people when the very schools they are responsible for are telling their teachers to buy their own dry erase markers. No one rational has quarrels with a superintendent personally, especially those who genuinely want to improve schools. However, I have a quarrel with superintendents who, with a clean conscious, can tell a group of students that the budget for their school play is gone during the day, then go home at night and cash a $140k check. Anyone with a brain and a desire to see kids have opportunities would feel the same way."
Birmingham,33tis8,auburnff,-3,Sat Apr 25 21:11:34 2015 UTC,"College football programs at UA and AU are self-sustaining. Therefore your argument is invalid.   You may not realize this, but simply saying ""your argument is invalid!"" doesn't make it so.    The people who are making the decisions for that school should have their salary pulled.   So you're in favor of pulling the salary of the school board, legislature, community, etc as well?   the budget for their school play is gone during the day, then go home at night and cash a $140k check   So how much should these people be allowed to earn?"
Birmingham,33tis8,dyslexda,2,Sat Apr 25 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"1) You are correct: simply saying ""your argument is invalid!"" does not make it so. However, you based your argument on the premise that a coach's salary is equal in theory to a school superintendent's salary in terms of revenue use. This premise is not true because the salary of the said coach is funded by means of ticket sales and endorsements achieved by playing and winning football games (hence my use of the phrase ""self-sustaining"") while a superintendent's salary is funded by means of tax dollars and federal subsidies. With an untrue premise, your logic does not prove sound and therefore your argument is invalid.  2) If you had read the remainder of my second point, you would see that I commented that the line of thinking referenced was not one that would achieve a solution. It was meant to be a demonstration of the outrage felt by some, including myself.   3) You keep pushing for someone to provide you with a solid number for what would be fair compensation, but that's not the point that I (and I believe most other commentators) are/am making. It's not that a superintendent by virtue does not warrant a $140k+ salary, it's that the current performance of Alabama's schools do not warrant that salary."
Birmingham,33tis8,auburnff,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:00:11 2015 UTC,"So you know people qualified more than the current superintendents willing to work for the same amount?  If they're more qualified, they'll just go somewhere else to be superintendent.  If you want to pay the current ones less, they'll go elsewhere.  It's supply and demand.  If your argument is that they're paid way more than people in the same position in other states then it may be worth listening to."
Birmingham,33tis8,redpachyderm,2,Tue Apr 28 02:59:09 2015 UTC,"Well that shouldn't matter since education is not football, college is not high school, and neither Saban or Malzahn have a struggling team.

Alabama pays Saban nearly $7 million because he is consistently getting them close or to the championship game."

Birmingham,33tis8,dyslexda,3,Sat Apr 25 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"Yo I'm not in the department of education. I don't know how much they should be paid nor am I offering a solution-that's not my job. But $200,000 isn't acceptable when the schools are failing and can't help kids graduate."
Birmingham,33tis8,tkeiy714,-1,Sat Apr 25 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"Alright, so $200,000 isn't acceptable to you, though you haven't said why the superintendents are to blame here (instead of any number of other people with their fingers in the pot). What salary would be acceptable?"
Birmingham,33tis8,dyslexda,2,Sat Apr 25 22:01:55 2015 UTC,Uhh it's their fault because it's their job to oversee operations and make sure it doesn't happen
Birmingham,33tis8,tkeiy714,-2,Sat Apr 25 23:29:38 2015 UTC,"So no other agents have an impact on a district's success? The legislature, school board, community members, etc play no part?"
Birmingham,33tis8,dyslexda,2,Sun Apr 26 05:37:31 2015 UTC,Alright I'm going to make this as simple as I can. A superintdendent is the main person responsible for a school's success. A number of factors can be blamed for a school failing one year in particular. But after a couple of consecutive failing years the superintdendent is at fault. Someone has to be held accountable and the superindendent is that person. $100-$200k income for a person to sit on his/her ass and take no steps to solve a problem is a problem.
Birmingham,33tis8,tkeiy714,-2,Sun Apr 26 06:07:03 2015 UTC,"Jesus, you really have no concept of how school districts are run, do you?"

Birmingham,33tis8,tkeiy714,2,Sun Apr 26 11:52:47 2015 UTC,"This was a really awesome read. But I have to ask, what would potentially lowering the superintendents' salary do to improve the performance of their respective schools?"
Birmingham,33tis8,Redlance,6,Sat Apr 25 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"Their inflated salaries are just a highlight of the underlying issue. We pay teachers next to nothing, yet pay less-contributing administrators more. Superintendents have a great deal more responsibility and as such need a higher salary. However, not this much higher (the input gap between the two is now almost $100k, average starting salary for a middle school teacher is around $40k). It's a nationwide problem. Examples of where we should be putting our education budget: continuing education programs for teachers (and actually follow through with them and not just create pay-for-certification programs), giving science teachers a working budget to educate through experimentation, paying for in-school ACT/SAT prep classes as a standard, creating higher salary teacher positions to attract people that may otherwise go to the private sector, and the like. Instead, we'd rather pay a group of dedicated remote observers to tell us what they think is wrong with the education system on an indefinite basis. It makes absolutely no sense."
Birmingham,33tis8,auburnff,3,Sat Apr 25 15:50:15 2015 UTC,I agree with you on all these points. :)

Birmingham,33tis8,auburnff,0,Sat Apr 25 15:32:56 2015 UTC,"Really? So you want to decrease the amount of superintendents? Or if you don't, what do you think a highly skilled professional like this should be paid?"

Birmingham,33q7gd,wrigh003,6,Fri Apr 24 19:56:19 2015 UTC,"I wrote my representative about this a few weeks ago. He gave me the courtesy of a form reply, I sent him a zillion links to studies, etc. and he never replied again.  Thinking of making a habit of it.    edit: hey, if you guys want to have some fun with your own congressmen and representatives:  (Here's the form reply you'll get) February 18, 2015  Dear wrigh003,  Thank you for contacting me regarding marijuana legalization. I appreciate your input on this important issue.  Federal law currently prohibits the medical or recreational use of marijuana. The Drug Enforcement Administration classifies Marijuana as a Schedule I substance, having no currently accepted medical use and having a high potential for abuse and dependency. In recent years, a number of states have moved to legalize marijuana in some form, whether for medical or recreational use.   Drug use has profoundly negative implications for individuals and society. Marijuana is addictive, impairs cognitive ability, and many times acts as a gateway to additional drug use. I do not support the legalization of marijuana and will work to ensure that federal law continues to prohibit its use.   Thank you again for taking the time to share your views. Please don't hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of any assistance.  Sincerely,  Gary Palmer Member of Congress  And my final rejoinder:  With all due respect, Congressman- a majority of the country does support legalization, as per a Gallup poll conducted in 2011, and repeated in 2014. At this point it's not even news:  http://www.gallup.com/poll/150149/Record-High-Americans-Favor-Legalizing-Marijuana.aspx http://www.gallup.com/poll/179195/majority-continues-support-pot-legalization.aspx  While I understand your (correct) assertion that marijuana is currently a schedule-I drug as listed by the DEA, that line of thinking and marijuana's DEA schedule placement is already in process of being shut down. In California, the matter of the constitutionality of the Schedule-I listing is already being challenged.  https://news.vice.com/article/california-judge-to-rule-on-constitutionality-of-federal-marijuana-classification The ""no medical use"" provision is also being challenged in a number of states (http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana-medicine), so far nearly half of all states (23/50) disagree with the notion, allowing some form of medical marijuana use, with a prescription, with a few states already moving to full legalization of recreational marijuana. The precedent of non-prosecution of federal law in these states is already set, and as time passes, more and more states will move in the direction of progressive marijuana reform, to collect the tax revenue created by the new enterprise.   Further, the question of whether marijuana is a ""gateway drug"" has been widely questioned in the last several years, and my assertion is that its legal status is a huge part of that. If you're already risking arrest/ prosecution/ prison to get high with a joint, that same person who sold you the joint can likely either sell you something harder, or at least get you connected to someone who can. It's not anything inherent to the drug, in other words, moreso that the drug is equated with methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, etc. from a legal perspective and plunges seekers into the black market while looking for a source.  http://healthland.time.com/2010/10/29/marijuna-as-a-gateway-drug-the-myth-that-will-not-die/  As noted in my prior email, remember that Alabama has a rich tradition of agricultural enterprise, and would be well suited to make a home for a new, multi-million-dollar industry, possibly to replace or supplement some of the industries that have flagged in recent years. The state of Colorado, for example, has found just over $50M in new revenue  in 2014 alone, and that number shows no signs of decreasing. (https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/1214%20Marijuana%20Tax%2C%20License%2C%20and%20Fees%20Report.pdf)  Colorado and Washington State (soon, probably, California) don't have to be the only states in the union stepping up to the plate to take advantage of a change in the national debate on marijuana- I think Alabama could do the same. Let's be on the cutting edge for a change instead of trailing the rest of the country in 49th or 50th place. Legalize it and tax it- it's not like we can't use the money.

They don't count increase in tuition to be an increase in athletics costs unless that increase is based off of an actual increase in academic costs, which it almost never is.

Birmingham,33llj7,aMiracleAtJordanHare,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:12:39 2015 UTC,"I'll concede that the boy ain't right, but that drug test was done within hours of his arrest...and I'm hard-pressed to believe the prosecution wouldn't bring it up in court had he tested positive. Regardless, sketchy behavior isn't evidence of being involved in a drug/firearm deal."
Birmingham,33llj7,Nordoisthebest,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:35:30 2015 UTC,"For some reason I can find nothing about the shotgun involved, perhaps it was another night. IIRC he was trying to either buy or sell a shotgun with some sketchball, could have sworn it was the night he took a tumble.  As for the drug test, that's not a charge unless already on a suspended sentence/probation which I believe at the time he was but for a separate county/municipal. Unfortunately only the judge can release those results."

Birmingham,33j540,john_snuu,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:01:11 2015 UTC,"Serious question - why does Marijuana need to be smoked? Why are the medical marijuana bills all centered around smoking? I honestly believe the smoking and growing aspect is what bothers a lot of people.  Surely if you needed the medical benefits that Marijuana offers, they could make it into a pill or oil or whatever. If you truly needed it medicinally, who cares how it gets into your body? I realize some people just enjoy smoking things, and that's fine, but I really believe the ""pothead-useless-lazy-stoner"" and ""these people just want an excuse to smoke weed legally"" perception/argument that some people seem to have would all but disappear. Is a pill with THC in it any worse than whatever is in a Xanax or oxycodone? Of course not. Your doctor prescribes you Zoloft or Xanax or whatever, no one cares. They figure you need it. I think the option, or even mandate, that the medicinal benefits be in pill/oil form would really benefit the movement. (If we're truly trying to help people, that is.)  Lastly, and I could be wrong, but I would think taking a marijuana pill/oil would be a hell of a lot easier on your respiratory system. Smoking anything can lead to other rather serious problems."
Birmingham,33j540,john_snuu,2,Thu Apr 23 19:28:04 2015 UTC,It doesn't need to be smoked necessarily from what I understand is that oils even work more efficiently
Birmingham,33j540,paco1342,0,Thu Apr 23 19:34:16 2015 UTC,"Right. If we really want to get people the medicinal benefits found in Marijuana, I think this would be a great approach. I'm surprised this angle doesn't get more attention.  If this argument has been brought up, what is the counter argument to it? How would prescribing someone a pill with THC in it be any different than prescribing someone a painkiller or benzo? Edit - I meant as in as a form of medication. Clearly benzos and pks are dangerous and addictive."
Birmingham,33j540,fetalbeej,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:44:13 2015 UTC,I think the largest issue though is that it shouldn't be illegal to begin with(in all forms) definitely compared to other substances.

Birmingham,33jen5,throwinit9,5,Thu Apr 23 06:08:41 2015 UTC,"I tip 20% minimum like I do everywhere else.  If you have worked in the service industry before, you'd understand why."

Birmingham,33jen5,Jaclo,2,Fri Apr 24 12:36:46 2015 UTC,"The blog that you linked mentions that the distinction between jobs that get tips and jobs that don't is arbitrary-the point I've been hinting at this whole time. There is no logic to it. The rest of it, and every other argument I've heard in favor of tipping servers, ignores the fact that severs can't be paid less than minimum wage if their tips don't meet it. There are plenty of minimum wage jobs that require just as much work as serving."
Birmingham,33jen5,caldwellesq,2,Fri Apr 24 12:53:47 2015 UTC,"I always tip $1.00 at Rojo. Tipping etiquette at counter service places is always such a gray area.

Birmingham,33jen5,willco17,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:07:08 2015 UTC,I have that conundrum at all places where you order at the counter and your food is brought out to you. I think the employees typically aren't being paid like waiters/waitresses so the tip is just a nice extra. Most of the time I don't do it but I will if I have some extra singles.
Birmingham,33jen5,blackfrances,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:37:55 2015 UTC,"They take your order, bring you your food, and clean up your mess afterwards. Why wouldn't you tip? Oh, right. You never worked in the service industry before. If you had, you wouldn't even ask that question."
Birmingham,33jen5,Jaclo,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"Hardee's and Whataburger do the same, but nobody ever thinks twice about tipping there. What do you think about that?"
Birmingham,33jen5,blackfrances,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"They don't bring you your food at Hardee's, and you clean up your own mess. Haven't eaten at whataburger so I don't know what goes on there.   Again, obviously you have never worked in the service industry or you wouldn't ask these questions and you would tip.   Personally I over-tip and when I return to places the servers remember me and I get treated extra well. I guess you are remembered as well, but you are getting the bare minimum treatment probably with some resentment thrown in.  Servers and ex-servers always tip well. They consider it to be a form of karma."

The process is exactly the same as it is as Rojo. And I've have also seen them clean other people's trays. So... Either you feel that the workers of Hardee's and Whataburger should be tipped the same as those of Rojo, or you think that working at Rojo is more tip-worthy than the fast food place that function the same way.  I have actually worked in a kitchen. Twice. Once as a dishwasher and once as a ""chef."" Both jobs seemed more miserable than those of the servers. No tips though. Just an hourly wage."
Birmingham,33jen5,Juggernaughty81,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:36:34 2015 UTC,"If you leave your shit laying around at any place, the employees have to pick it up. The difference is that fast food has places for you to put the trays and handy garbage cans. You are supposed to clean up after yourself. If someone has to clean up my mess, I tip. They are in the service industry. I wouldn't say someone in fast food is."
Birmingham,33jen5,Jaclo,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:02:44 2015 UTC,"So, in regard to Rojo, you feel that a person having to clean a table is worth a 10-20% tip? Because that's the only differentiating factor here."

Be VERY mindful of the catering company that you use. I don't know if Avondale has an exclusivity contract with any specific caterer, but the one they used for St. Patrick's Day 2015 was an abomination - they oversold the event and ran out of food in the first hour or two - they finally had a resupply arrive by hour 3 - long after everyone was ticked.   I'd imagine the reception would be on the upper floor, accessible by external staircase-only. Dunno if this is an issue, but it's worth mentioning."

And that catering arrangement was not an exclusive Avondale contract. I know people personally at the caterer and at the event sponsor organization and we talked about it.   EDIT - This may have been a different event than the one you're talking about. It's a popular venue apparently ;-)"

Birmingham,33hfgd,BlazerMorte,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:15:25 2015 UTC,Yours must have been a different event. No oysters at the St. Patty's day party to which i was referring. I guess it's easy to overbook such a small space. Limited table space for big eating events.

Birmingham,33f43e,mindshadow,12,Wed Apr 22 15:39:46 2015 UTC,"/u/anonstep1983, before you decide on an attorney you need to decide what kind of divorce you want for you and your children. I say it like that for a reason.   I am 40+ with three children and just divorced my spouse of almost 25 years in 2013. There is no template for divorce but if you hire a bulldog you are going to put her in the same position and what does that do for the kids? It makes them the strategic point of battle in an ugly spit match. In my case our priority was as painless as possible event for the children. And honestly saving $$$ on lawyer costs. We agreed to work out the terms at night after the kids were asleep for two weeks and we both chewed on our lower lips until they bled while we (mostly) civilly worked through the details.   Was it easy? Hell no. Do I have regrets? Of course. Will your divorce be like mine? Or anyone elses? NO. But my point is that there are a dozen ways that a divorce can go and as painful as it is you need to decide what is really important to you. Sometimes it's not what you want to admit.   EDIT: I mention $$$ because the one thing I'm very confident telling you (not just from my divorce but from what I've read in general as well) that your financial position will change significantly. Your tax situation changes. Your income/expenses change. Everything financially changes and you will have to deal with that on day one of your divorce whether you like it or not.   PLEASE feel free to PM me if you want to discuss more and get an open, objective opinion. Heck, lunch is on me if you want to meet and talk under more private conditions."

It is amazing how many decades it takes for perceptions to change.  As for the show, I was at the 7:00 one, and there was very little heckling. The opening act had the mic way too far down his throat, thus the audio was terrible. Overall I enjoyed the show, but I don't know that it was worth the price of admission. I have always liked the style of Chappelle, and it seemed to be very similar to his old stand-up style."

Birmingham,33egci,john_snuu,3,Wed Apr 22 01:01:38 2015 UTC,That article is from 2012 so we are no longer number 5. I think we are number 8 now. However this is referring to the metro area of Birmingham not just Downtown and Southside. Downtown and Southside are actually pretty chill for the most part.  For some reason people think Birmingham city is just Downtown and Southside but the city itself is actually quite huge. Birmingham stretches down 280 to Trussville/Clay to Bessemer and so on.

I genuinely felt bad for them, but it is things like that which give the city a bad image. There are homeless populations in almost every city, but they should be properly cared for and not left on the streets over night. People fear the element of unpredictability from strangers on the street, and I think that's what people are refering to when they say ""sketchy"". Some of that is personal bias, but I do think there are still things that could be done."
Birmingham,33egci,DontExpectMuch,5,Wed Apr 22 16:22:40 2015 UTC,I thought it was hilarious. I was at the 9pm show. I was suprised/annoyed with how often people kept screaming things though. It made for some pretty great moments but a lot of times it was just too much.   Like the 5 restaurant part...damn that was funny.

He was pretty high anyway, so the show fell apart about halfway through. He did the Cosby bit twice. It was a hilarious show, and I actually like that the later show kind of just devolved into doing a lot of improv and bouncing off the crowd's shouts to jump to different topics (like Key and Peele)"

Cosby, foot vagina, and then he forgot he already asked the girl Alyssa what her name was and said it wrong again the second time. We were in the far back balcony section and the whole thing was a little bit of a let down. Just wasn't the stand up I've seen him do so many times.

As for rental homes, she may be able to find a townhome in Shelby County or a home in Montevallo for especially cheap. Montevallo is quaint, but it doesn't have a lot in terms of diversity, if that is important to her.   Mt. Olive, which is north of Birmingham, offers a lot of land for not a lot of money, but it's a conservative area. It isn't as far from BHM as Calera or Pelham, so that's a bonus.   There are parts of Birmingham, like Crestwood, Avondale, and Norwood that may be worth looking at as well.   Has she tried working with a real estate agent that specializes in rentals?"

That other ACTUAL case and evidence in regarding his previous officer impersonation crime has no bearing on this impersonation crime. It's a separate issue.'   When you're serial offender your past should be called into question by the court. Add that to the fact that I think the guy is a sleezy prick for handfull of other reasons.   I hope this hits him harder than the jump off of vulcan did! I'm tired of all the religious hypocrites parading around doing terrible things while relying on the crutch that is their reputation in a religious community to even out their character.

It's only ""relevant"" for sentencing purposes, or to show something like motive or intent, which is why the state got it in here.    Imagine how easy it'd be for prosecutors to bring up bogus charges for serial offenders and convince a jury that because a guy has a bad history, that they actually did that same thing here.  The attenuation of that relationship (x has previous drug offenses, x owns the drugs we found) is why the state had to really work hard to show they were getting the prior arrest evidence in to show something other than ""Pitt once did it, so he did it this time."""

Birmingham,338s19,BBTheMadMan,17,Mon Apr 20 15:41:13 2015 UTC,"OK, so it looks like this has happened multiple times.  The city gets a federal grant proposal for transit, which is pegged to a plan and political agreement in the region.  The regional governments then utterly fail to deliver on their end, and the funds expire.  So, we never really had the money to begin with, but rather a promise for the money if we could come up with a plan and regional cooperation to implement it.  Once again the balkanization of the bham metro area shoots us in the foot.  http://blog.al.com/sweethome/2009/03/no_plan_100_million_set_aside.html  Out of the 87M, we only got 3.5M to do a study, the results of which were published as an executive summary in 2013.  You can find it here:  http://www.i65-us31mobilitymatters.com/"
Birmingham,338s19,NJWhiskeyHunter,7,Mon Apr 20 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"upvoted for ""Balkanization""..."
Birmingham,338s19,DriveByBBQ,8,Mon Apr 20 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the link. This is exactly what I was looking for. Basically, we never got the funds because as a metro area, ""We can't get our shit together.""  This city needs a more collaborative effort if we are to move forward. Otherwise, growth will be stifled, and other cities will dwarf us and likely lure everything good we have away.   My fear is that some suburbs of this city actually want to keep Bham small and keep growth to a minimum. I've heard it stated as to one of the reasons why Birmingham didn't get the Delta contract years ago. They wouldn't agree to fund it, because it would bring in more business, tourism, and people which would expand into their prized property."
Birmingham,338s19,Everwinter81,3,Mon Apr 20 16:34:52 2015 UTC,Birmingham turned the Delta contract down. It's urban legend otherwise. The leadership of the city didn't want Birmingham to be a sprawling metropolis.
Birmingham,338s19,emanresu_sdrawkcab,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:36:05 2015 UTC,"They also passed a huge aviation fuel tax when Delta was shopping around IIRC. They claim that this didn't affect Delta's decision, but it certainly didn't help things."
Birmingham,338s19,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Tue Apr 21 04:31:41 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the way the suburbs view the city.  You may be right.  Regardless, the problem we have with transit is that in order to be effective, it can't just be confined to the city limits.  We need all the cities affected to agree to a plan and potentially to agree to provide part of the funding.  So far that hasn't happened.  I'm worried that it may never happen, given the political landscape in both the Birmingham area and the state as a whole."
Birmingham,338s19,catonic,2,Mon Apr 20 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"Well, if DOT doesn't build shitty roads, the asphalt lobby doesn't get paid. If people aren't using roads to death, DOT doesn't have to repair them as often, and then DOT has to cut back on workers and more importantly, on outside contracts. Follow the money.   But yes, until it comes to ""no federal money for anyone until we hammer out, agree, and fully fund a unified metro-area transit plan UP FRONT""... nothing will ever happen. The People are entirely too proletariat.   FWIW, I've done the math: it's possible to put a rail line over 280 down to the Super Target, but the issues become parking areas, stations, etc. It's at the limits of what rail can do, but it can be done. We need to invest in this before the next big ice storm, so the entire place doesn't grind to a halt. But we have such a hate-hate affair with railroads and public transit."

Birmingham,338s19,HelloPaul,4,Mon Apr 20 16:00:09 2015 UTC,The city of Birmingham is not bankrupt nor has it ever been (at least in my memory).  Last I saw the city of Birmingham has an Aa credit rating with Moody's which is pretty good (not great but by no means bad).  The sewar scandal dealt with the Jefferson County Commission not the Birmingham City Council or the Birmingham Water Works.
Birmingham,338s19,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Mon Apr 20 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"All true.  The transit deal was for the city + county, so I figured there might have been an impact.  Of course, the fact that the money never came kind of negates that thought entirely."
Birmingham,338s19,mixduptransistor,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:39:29 2015 UTC,"The money is destined for the BJCTA, which is a separate governmental entity from both the county and the city, so even if both the city and county were bankrupt, it wouldn't affect the transit system."
Birmingham,338s19,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about that.  In order for the plan outlined at www.i65-us31mobilitymatters.com to be implemented (and this is the plan that was drawn up with 3.5M of the 87M we're talking about here) we would need that money to go to a lot of different places, not just the BJCTA.  The plan includes HOV lanes, new interchanges, new bus stop infrastructure, new busses, traffic lights that respond to bus signaling, etc.  A lot of that is outside the BJCTA's authority.  Some of it would be at the city level, some at the county, and some likely at the state level.  So yes, while I fully admit I was wrong about this money going down the bankruptcy hole, to say that it was all destined for the BJCTA is incorrect."

That's not the question though.   If I gave you start up funds to do a project for me, and you did nothing, I would want to know where the money went? Can you justify spending the money without any kind of outcome?   Even if it is a bus line that connects cities on 459, at least you'd have shown something."
Birmingham,338s19,WarriorHealer,3,Mon Apr 20 16:04:43 2015 UTC,"It went away.  That's literally the answer.  What happened to the $150 million in charity fund that UAB was supposed to get for taking on the care burden after Cooper-Green shut down?  It went away.  County promised and performed an audit that cost a few million.  Here is their conclusion: it went away.  It's very important we understand this.  The money may not have existed to begin with. If it only existed on paper, then that paper went away, so in the end, it still went away.  It went away."

Birmingham,335wp4,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Mon Apr 20 04:16:05 2015 UTC,"I can comment on Phoenix, I lived there for a few years when they first opened up. There are both subsidized and unsubsidized leases; as part of a deal with the city they have to have a certain number of the subsidized units for a certain number of years.  I do not know how many of each they maintain at this point.   There was, and I imagine still is, a waitlist for both the single and double bedroom units. The property manager has changed since I lived there, but they maintain office hours in a ground floor office and  can also be contacted via their website. There was not a lot of turnover in the residents when I lived there, and if I didnt need more space I would still be there myself. Was a great place to live.   I could try to answer any other questions about the space if anyone has any."
Birmingham,335wp4,Hal9_ooo,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"Can you tell a bit more about the living experience? Soundproofing, finishings, any quirks of the building?"
Birmingham,335wp4,Hal9_ooo,3,Sun Apr 19 23:42:53 2015 UTC,"Soundproofing depends on your unit. I was on the top floor with one brick wall and one made of drywall. The drywall side I could hear my neighbors bass if he had it loud enough, but that was rare. Occasional hallway noise, but only if someone came in drunk and loud, again pretty rare.   Finishings: polished concrete, exposed brick, some drywall. Skylights in the upstairs units. The building has a laundry room, small fitness room, and a few vending machines. Underground parking for some, and some spaces above ground for the remainder.   When I'm not on mobile I'll try and find some images of my old place.

The developer has sold all of his rentals as of this month.  There may be one left, but I think it just went under contract.  At this point the overwhelming majority of units are owner occupied. Yes, some of the units have weird layouts.  Offsetting that is the fact that most have nice big street facing balconies. The parking is awesome.  Totally covered and secured."

Birmingham,335wp4,willco17,1 point,Mon Apr 20 11:59:00 2015 UTC,"The penthouse is still empty.  I think this is mostly due to the fact that some bits of it are unfinished, and the asking price is absurd.  It is zoned for live/work though, which may justify a higher price."

The lobby was just renovated.  The top floor unit has water damage because the owner won't fix the issue, so I don't know why you would include that.   Common areas depend on the people who live on each floor. Some are really nice, some less so.   As far as I know, every unit has laundry hook ups, but there is a shared laundry unit in the basement.   Awesome list though."

When we toured, it was kinda shabby and there were two vomits (one right outside the door and one right inside). It wasn't a great first impression so I'm glad to hear it's been improved. The elevators were so cool. Water damage on the top floor means there is an issue with the roof, which is the HOA's issue, not the homeowners issue. There was also water damage in the stairwells which again is an HOA issue. Our realtor requested information from the HOA (any recent special assessments, when the last major capital repairs were done, etc.) for us and found whoever she was dealing with on the HOA to be rude and unhelpful. I feel like we also heard from out friend who rented that they were having trouble getting enough owners together for an HOA quorum. Our interaction with Watts just left a weird impression overall."

I've been living there since 2011.   If it's the correct top unit, that owner won't fix a window because he contends it's a building issue, so that's where the water is coming from. Also, his patio leaks because he won't fix that either. Maybe it is a building issue. Maybe I'm misremembering info. I don't know."
Birmingham,335wp4,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:55:52 2015 UTC,I'm glad you guys got new management. Who are you using - our building has been pondering a transition.  It's a bummer the top-unit is being a bonehead about things.

Birmingham,335wp4,jackson675,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:10:30 2015 UTC,"I used to rent a 1br in Watts Tower back around 2001ish.  The unit was solid, awesome views.  But we did have some issues with the management.  Our upstairs neighbor's water heater leaked, and flooded our storage room.  The water damage ruined a lot of stuff, including some artwork.  The management company never even came to fix the water damage, our calls went unanswered.  At this time, some of the lower floors were also unfinished.  During the deepest cold of the winter, they put kerosene heaters down there, presumably to keep the pipes from freezing.  I woke at 1am to the smell of very strong kerosene fumes in my apartment.  After getting in the elevator and checking several other floors and noticing the same, I stopped at one of the unfinished floors to find that a heater had leaked kerosene in a large puddle on the floor, so I called the fire dept.  They cleared out the building while they checked out the situation.  For my trouble, I got a thorough yelling at by the building management.  Needless to say I moved right the hell out when my lease was up.  This was 14 years ago though, so it might be a very different situation today."
Birmingham,336ym4,EnIdiot,6,Mon Apr 20 02:55:24 2015 UTC,Here are the real drugs being sold at that school as far as what I've found from asking old friends. 25i (knock off ResearchChemical imitation LSD) weed occasionally molly. One or two people doing opiates (as far as I know) this is every high school in this state. There's a lack of fact based education on drugs. Its sad but true that this is one of the better cases in our state
Birmingham,336ym4,Enragedpixel,0,Mon Apr 20 17:02:09 2015 UTC,"I am not as afraid of weed, mushrooms, etc. as I am the synthetic/knock-off stuff. 25i sounds particularly nasty. I heard they were vaping the stuff. Any truth in that rumor?"
Birmingham,336ym4,bloodraven42,2,Mon Apr 20 17:11:21 2015 UTC,"You can't vape 25i. It's taken the same way acid is. It's not particularly dangerous, but it's not exactly the most fun trip either. Doesn't compare to the real stuff at all."
Birmingham,336ym4,Enragedpixel,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:53:00 2015 UTC,"No truth, not even possible to get high off of to my knowledge. I believe (like LSD) it is sensitive to heat and therefore would be destroyed upon vaporization. It was probably just kids who smoked getting tired of being caught by their parents so they decided to get someone to buy them an ecig.  Edit: also dry herb vapes do exist. So it could be stoners"
Birmingham,336ym4,frenchtoastking17,3,Mon Apr 20 17:14:23 2015 UTC,The only way I care about this story is if the students responsible weren't held accountable for their actions because of where they go to school.
Birmingham,336ym4,datraceman,2,Mon Apr 20 13:26:26 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Drugs are a problem in every school, especially rich kid schools. Knowing many people who went there over a decade ago, drugs were common at the high school then. Lortabs were traded like candy at that school at the time as was ecstasy.   I think what is most concerning and why so many kids got expelled is harder street drugs were dealt on campus. There were enough people in the loop and were either using/spreading the word the school had to expel them."
Birmingham,336ym4,Broseph1617,3,Mon Apr 20 13:34:01 2015 UTC,"I know one student sold LSD but he was 17 years old. Technically he can't be tried because he is a minor, but depending on the amount, he could be tried as an adult. I doubt the amount was large enough to do so"
Birmingham,336ym4,Enragedpixel,2,Mon Apr 20 17:03:31 2015 UTC,rumor says it was at least a 10 strip but possibly up to a sheet and the only people I have been told took it said that it was actually 25i. Take all that with a grain of salt as these are high school students talking.  Also Alabama takes psychedelic charges a lot more serious than weed or alcohol. He will more than likely get a harsh sentence.
Birmingham,336ym4,Enragedpixel,2,Mon Apr 20 17:18:46 2015 UTC,In buying it who knows if he lied. And there is a distinct difference that not everyone knows but should (real LSD doesn't have a taste/you can swallow LSD and it will work) if it's was fake and the student was lying. It's appalling that someone would do this because of how dangerous 2C (root of 25i) is. I've had friends OD on it a few years ago when how to tell the difference was less known (by them anyway) its messed up stuff.
Birmingham,336ym4,RussNP,5,Mon Apr 20 17:30:39 2015 UTC,I can imagine it being all of the above.   If anyone was arrested over 18 I think it would be public record but if was a minor arrested I don't think we will be seeing those records anytime soon.  It's good to see local news exposing this hypocrisy.  If it had happened at a public school I imagine a press conference would have been held on this by now.
Birmingham,336ym4,mixduptransistor,5,Mon Apr 20 18:42:03 2015 UTC,"Not really. We had a drug scandal when I was in high school at a public school in Shelby County, and it was never in the paper or on TV. Not even the Shelby County Reporter.  Drugs in schools is not really all that newsworthy. I'm sure the arrest records are private because the suspects charged are minors. That everyone thinks Briarwood students are some kind of saints, different from the general population of kids, or that Shelby County is immune to this type of stuff and people are surprised shows how naive people are about how the world works."
Birmingham,336ym4,Enragedpixel,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:15:23 2015 UTC,"True as well. Kids of all walks of life will find ways to get access to drugs and to deal drugs. Not all of it makes the news, but if it involves FBI and law enforcement it should be reported on. My own kids got to school not far from there, and I'd like to know what drugs are making inroads into my community. Heroin is making inroads everywhere."
Birmingham,336ym4,mixduptransistor,3,Mon Apr 20 12:51:11 2015 UTC,"Educate your children with hard facts that you can back up and they will be less likely to do the more harsh drugs (opiates/dissociatives) and in a day and age where you can order drugs off the internet, being able to convince your kids its not worth it will be the best thing you can do."

As far as bars, there are WAY too many to list, but there is almost anything to fit your needs. Read the sticky thread on the frontpage, or search and there are dozens of threads discussing bars.   I realize this method can be pricey, but honestly, the best thing you can do is just go inside any bar you see at least once on a Friday or Saturday night and see what you think.

Still, underage drinking happens at any club that 18+ and sells alcohol and I won't pretend like it was an exception, but I don't think it was any worse there than anywhere else, at least when I worked there. I don't know what, if anything, else went on to make the few people on this sub hate that place so much.

Rare Martini has okay music, but it's 18+, so take that as you will. Tin Roof is fun depending on the night! I've gone on Fridays and it can be a little dead.

I don't know if the trail is even still walkable. I do know that if it was a park back then it was unmarked. The signs didn't spring up until 10 or so years ago."
Birmingham,335fd4,MisterTito,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"I live over there (moved about 2 1/2 years ago) and I know nothing about it.  The signs that are apparent now just appeared fairly recently I think-- I had never known the area had a name. I know nothing of trails through there. In the last few weeks, someone did trim the grass and everything. I do know that I'm tired of seeing trash bags dangling from trees and posts over there. It's almost like making it a ""Nature Park"" means that no one has to maintain it anymore."

Birmingham,3353ms,AsthmaticMechanic,2,Sun Apr 19 17:47:19 2015 UTC,You should see if there are any MeetUp groups in the area.
Birmingham,3353ms,theblaine,2,Sun Apr 19 17:12:32 2015 UTC,"If you've got your heart set on Oak Mountain, then that's cool--but you should consider hiking (for free) at Ruffner Mountain.  It's run by the city, rather than the state.  I don't have a lot of love for Birmingham City Council, but they haven't shut Ruffner down yet, and hopefully steady patronage will keep it that way.  They have donation boxes if you want to contribute something, and the trails are nice, and offer a range of difficulties.  Plus, as a bonus, you don't have to drive through Hoover or Pelham, or deal with large crowds (as you would at Oak Mountain).  I don't have advice for finding a group, but if you're cool (read: make interesting conversation; don't have one narrow field of interest; won't be creepy), perhaps my small hiking group (two couples consisting of 3 males and 1 female) would be willing to add a fifth when you're passing through."

Birmingham,3329ax,dressmenice,5,Sat Apr 18 21:38:46 2015 UTC,Seriously. Hope he spends a good bit of time indoors.
Birmingham,3329ax,virgilturtle,2,Sat Apr 18 22:27:14 2015 UTC,Can someone explain why people hate this guy so much? I keep seeing people hate on him but every article I've read makes him just seem like an average idiot who did some stupid stuff. Not some monster.   Also where did he get an honorary badge and why does he have it still??
Birmingham,3329ax,disasteruss,6,Sun Apr 19 11:04:02 2015 UTC,"Personally, I dislike him because he is intelligent enough to convince people to follow him and yet stupid enough to believe that doing so allows him to become a law unto himself.   There's really no defending his actions; he flashed an honorary badge to a Calera cop and claimed to be a deputy. Later, he again impersonated an officer and tried to evade police, leading them on a foot chase before falling off a 45 foot cliff. You don't run like he did unless you're trying to avoid being caught. He knew he'd broken the law.   I can't comprehend why anyone would want to continue to keep a man who behaves in that manner on a pedestal or to believe that he is a moral compass that others should follow. All evidence points to him being a conceited prick with in intense desire to control the actions and thoughts of others, and a complete inability to obey the law. He should be incarcerated and could probably use a bit of therapy."
Birmingham,3329ax,virgilturtle,2,Sun Apr 19 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"I had heard this guy was in trouble with the law from a friend who used to be into the basement scene, but only just now learned any specifics about it. From what I gather, the evidence against him is fairly damning. Any idea why he is apparently so confident in the case for his innocence? Seems like he's pretty fucked if he pleads ""not guilty"" to charges like this and then loses."
Birmingham,3329ax,CollectiveSlowClap,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"I think he's confident because he's facing a trial by jury and any jury of his peers is likely to be not just religious, but Alabama Religious©. He also has three lawyers who will abuse every loophole and opportunity available. I'm hopeful he'll get what he deserves but I'm not confident that justice will be served."

Birmingham,3329ax,disasteruss,8,Mon Apr 20 17:56:24 2015 UTC,He is a delusional narcissist who used religion and party atmosphere to profit off of impressional youth.

Birmingham,3329ax,64voxac30,3,Sun Apr 19 02:21:45 2015 UTC,I hope he gets what he deserves. He is a deceitful prick and the fact that people follow him like a profit genuinely scares me for our species.

Birmingham,331kac,See_Em,3,Sat Apr 18 17:19:56 2015 UTC,"I see, I see. I knew Reddit would be the reliable place"
Birmingham,331kac,mixduptransistor,20,Sat Apr 18 17:36:19 2015 UTC,"No, it's not as bad as people say. I guarantee all of your ""friends"" haven't spent more than a couple of hours downtown in the past 10 years.  I live just outside of downtown (Avondale) and work at UAB and have zero problems."
Birmingham,331kac,mixduptransistor,2,Sat Apr 18 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, any advices on places to check into?"
Birmingham,331kac,mixduptransistor,2,Sat Apr 18 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking for.   For most people outside of the city limits (read: the suburbs) ""Downtown"" means anywhere inside the city of Birmingham.   However, most people in the city consider ""Downtown"" when thinking of a place to live as the loft/condo district around the railroad tracks and northward, generally around all the tall buildings.  Other places your friends would probably consider ""downtown"" but aren't really, are neighborhoods like Avondale, Forest Park, Southside, Glen Iris, etc.   And yeah, there are still some iffy neighborhoods and outright dangerous ones like Titusville, Ensley, West End, Gate City area, etc.  The ""up and coming"" neighborhoods are East Lake, Norwood, Woodlawn.   But, again, depends on what you're looking for, where you'll be working, and if you want to be able to bike/walk/ride the bus. Do you want a lot of restaurants? Are you looking to buy or rent? Even if renting, looking for a house or apartment? If buying looking for a loft/condo?"
Birmingham,331kac,Tauntsnake,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:15:02 2015 UTC,"That adds up and i'm looking to rent a loft or condo, but i hear tha markets crazy, so i'd settle with an apartment. I'll be working downtown so i'd definitely want to live nearby and skip that traffic. Restaurants would be a definite plus, just convenience."
Birmingham,331kac,Tauntsnake,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:50:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the proximate neighborhoods like Avondale, Southside, Glen Iris, and even Crestwood won't have traffic problems. You really only get into traffic with the suburbs like Hoover or Homewood.   There are a TON of apartments currently under construction downtown/midtown/UAB and also in Lakeview.  Not sure of your timeframe, the UAB/Southside area would probably be a good place to look for a place for now, and then as the ""midtown"" (newish residential area around railroad park) area starts to open up, and some of the projects downtown like Thomas Jefferson Tower and Pizitz come online, you'll probably find something better and newer there.  If you want to move easily between downtown and Southside, I'd look for something that is close to the DART circulator routes (https://www.bjcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/dart_system_map6_4_2012.pdf)"
Birmingham,331kac,WarriorHealer,3,Sun Apr 19 00:58:04 2015 UTC,I bet your friends who say downtown is terrible also said the baseball stadium was going to fail.    The person above speaks the truth.

Birmingham,331kac,aerinjl1,8,Sat Apr 18 19:32:25 2015 UTC,"I moved here from Atlanta in 2012 and Birmingham is a way nicer downtown. It is more compact than Atlanta so it is easy to walk to everything. My husband walks to work every day, and I walk most days. We walk to the bar, to dinner, to our friends, to our entertainment. Once we get the Publix, we'll walk to our groceries. It's amazing what a no-cost commute does for your entertainment budget!   Comparing Birmingham to Atlanta again: downtown Birmingham has felt way safer. We walk everywhere, even at night. I'm a younger female and have never had an issue more serious than a homeless person yelling at me across the street (he thought I was an angel? It was weird). That being said, we don't drunkenly stumble down alleyways at 2am...it's a city, don't be stupid. I park my car on the street, never had an issue.

I've lived in the loft district for about six years while going to school at UAB. Like any city, you need to stay aware of your surroundings, particularly at night, but most of the lofts downtown are very secure and things are becoming increasingly gentrified, for better or worse.

Most multi-dwelling places in Birmingham explicitly prohibit having a grill on the property. I think there's some sort of city or state law regarding it... Some places do provide a shared common grill space, but with the exception of high end places or newer places, most of the areas I've seen are in a terrible state of disrepair (rusted, non-functioning, unsanitary, etc,.)..

Birmingham,32yp3s,mckulty,2,Sat Apr 18 12:57:59 2015 UTC,Yes it is allowed. Now would be a good time to go since it rained a lot recently. Otherwise you will be pushing a good bit.
Birmingham,32yp3s,Diactylmorphinefiend,2,Fri Apr 17 22:54:25 2015 UTC,That Lake Purdy rule is ridiculous. They won't let you bring your own canoe/kayak but they'll let you bring your own outboard motor to use on their jon boats. It makes no sense.
Birmingham,32yp3s,IdlewildPeach,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:11:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I couldn't agree more... It really comes across as little more than an excuse used to maintain a monopoly on access to the lake... It also seems that they like it being a 'fishing lake' (rather than a general recreational one) - and that  they are 'protecting' the fish population so that the lake can be used for fishing tournaments and the sort.  When I spoke with the guy about access and and brought up this point of people being allowed to bring their own gas motors (that had been in other bodies of water), their own bait (so potentially invasive species) and how these related to the whole guise of ""maintaining the natural pristine state of the lake in order to protect our drinking water reserve"", it became apparent quickly that a logical discussion backed in reason wasn't necessarily something they wished to engage in... Drive out there in the evening or on the weekend... Cars pulled off everywhere, with people fishing seemingly unrestricted from the side of the road - something that appears to be condoned as the numerous signs around the lake only specifically mention the prohibition of private boats, directly citing canoes and kayaks in the process.  But my canoe is a threat to the water... Yeeeahhhh....  I did contact the Alabama Game & Fish Office as well as a few other governmental offices that I felt may know a bit about the lake and the portion of the Little Cahaba River that feeds it... While no one that I spoke to really seemed to know specifics (understandable if you don't live nearby), when they looked at maps and referenced what they had at their immediate disposal, the general response was first laughter at the claim that the Birmingham Water Works rules regarding the lake somehow universally applied to other public connecting water ways... They then followed up with stating that the public was free to use the river recreationally as they wished, that it was documented as being a beautiful stretch for canoers and kayakers and then the just reminded me to keep the rights of the property owners around the river in mind (not dragging your boat through someone's yard to access the river - something I would NEVER EVER do anyways).  But whatevs.. There's plenty of water to play around in over here, so it's all good.. But I really do wish that the BWW board would reconsider this policy - or at least be honest about the real reasons that the policy is in place, as it doesn't really seem to be to protect the water from invasive species (or they'd not allow the fishing, personal motors, etc)...    I am a 'only leave your footprints' type of outdoorsman... More than that, I enjoy leaving a place cleaner than it was when I arrived - usually taking trash bags to carry out what I can in the free space left in my boat.. It's quite a shame that Lake Purdy's policies prevent me from doing this - as a drive around the lake makes it pretty evident that this would be beneficial as there's quite a bit of litter along the shores plainly visible from the road...  But than again, I'd really hate for my clean new canoe to damage Lake Purdy's seemingly delicate ecosystem - fortunately, they have all the oil residue provided by the allowed motors to keep everything in balance...."
Birmingham,32yp3s,IdlewildPeach,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:08:59 2015 UTC,Very well said and I completely agree. You would think with that rule they have in place that they would keep it a little cleaner on the banks. I'd much rather give my time and money to state parks.

They are frankly a little ridiculous unless you get really lucky. The 1,100sq ft 2 bed/2 bath we rented for $1100 2011-2013 now goes for $1600+. I've seen some 1 bed/1 baths starting to go for that. Blows my mind.  You will need to either hire a realtor/company to help you with the big management companies and their 'wait-lists' or have a way to put your ear to the ground for the privately owned lofts. You're in luck cause I'll pass this your way. Pat Ballard is looking for a tenet, he's a great guy.

Great view of St. Paul's cathedral. $1600/month includes water/sewer, phone, high-speed internet - everything but electricity. On-site owner/management. If interested, call Pat at 205-706-7069.

Because condos/lofts are typically owned by an individual as opposed to a company, they require a realtor to be shown. The exception to that being is if they are being listed by owner. However, the Loft District does stay very full and I've seen lofts lease the day they come on the market. Best of luck to you in your search!"

Birmingham,32vbxv,mixduptransistor,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"Alabama ethics law requires that public employees disclose all real estate holdings that aren't your house (meaning, the building that the jewelry store occupies) and also requires you to disclose any businesses in which you own 5% or greater of the shares. Neither the jewelry store and the marketing/PR firm were disclosed on their ethics forms.  There's also a massive conflict of interest in using your own company for no-bid services.

Birmingham,32vbxv,ericrz,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:44:16 2015 UTC,"Oh, I suppose the ethics violations are on Kahn, not Bruno -- seeing as how Bruno is not technically a State employee, even though she's paid nearly $30K a month by the university to perform three jobs.  So maybe Bruno is legally/ethically in the clear.  But a common sense reading of the situation tells me it stinks to high heaven, and that the administration of UAB (with full consent of the BOT) has reached new lows of corruption."
Birmingham,32vbxv,ZombieFish15,4,Fri Apr 17 12:49:51 2015 UTC,"She is in violation because she hired a friend?  If this was some lady that she didnt know and she hired her and still had this impressive of a return on the investment would you still be saying this?  Doesnt matter if its her freaking twin sister that she hires and pays, as long as she is doing her job."
Birmingham,32vbxv,ericrz,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:52:37 2015 UTC,"Well, as far as Kahn goes, you can start right here:  ""Kahn has not listed the business [jewelry store owned jointly with Bruno] on her statement of economic interest filed with the Alabama Ethics Commission. State employees are required to disclose such interests under Alabama's ethics laws if ownership is more than 5 percent.""  That's a clear and obvious violation.  I know the Alabama ethics guidelines well, I filled out that form every year for 15 years.  And of course it would matter if it were her twin sister, UAB and the State have clear guidelines about nepotism.  It isn't just always about ""do the job, everything else is fine.""  People commonly hire friends, but there's also generally a bid process at UAB, which seems like it was short-circuited here."
Birmingham,32vbxv,ZombieFish15,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:55:36 2015 UTC,"Who has said that her ownership is more than 5%?   Who said she favored her because she was a friend?  Maybe she was favored because she knew how good of a job she would do, which has been clearly shown."
Birmingham,32vbxv,ericrz,2,Fri Apr 17 12:58:34 2015 UTC,"Typically, outside companies at government agencies are selected through a bid process -- they interview, show samples of their previous work, and provide a quote for their business.  The agency then selects a company based on this information.  Bruno got to skip all that.  As for the ownership of Jordan Alexander, it's named after Kahn and Bruno's two children, and they call themselves ""partners"" in the store. Whether or not that means an exact 50/50 split, again, use common sense -- how likely is it that Kahn's ownership, and share of the revenue, is 4% or less?"
Birmingham,32vbxv,ZombieFish15,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:02:33 2015 UTC,"Typically, but not always.  I dont know how likely it is.  Thats not my job to speculate and it shouldnt be a news reporters job to speculate either.  He has better connections than I do and evidently you do also so why not make some phone calls and get back to me when yall can prove how much her ownership truly is.  Hell I have a company named after me (by my father) that I have zero ownership in and it makes me zero dollars a year."
Birmingham,32vbxv,ericrz,2,Fri Apr 17 13:08:24 2015 UTC,"It is likely that Archibald, Whitmire, and other reporters are digging into this.  There wasn't any speculation in this article -- there were figures and facts.  I expect additional facts to continue surfacing.  UAB didn't learn anything from the Nixon Administration, apparently.  It's not necessarily the initial action that gets you -- it's the coverup."
Birmingham,32vbxv,ericrz,2,Fri Apr 17 13:12:17 2015 UTC,"But is the ""greater good"" at UAB served by the continuing presidency of Ray Watts?  When the faculty senate, undergrad and grad student associations, and alumni association have all issued no confidence votes, does it benefit the university for Watts and the BoT to dig in their heels and refuse to change?  Current UAB faculty are embarrassed by this, and I personally know at least two who are accelerating their career plans in an effort to leave UAB because of this.  I have to imagine prospective faculty are looking at this as well.  Even if they don't care a lick about football, seeing the administration ignore all of its constituencies doesn't make UAB an attractive career stop."

Most coins are worth what someone is willing to pay, others have a known value but that will be already listed in a collector's book.  Everyone will low ball you but you don't have to sell it until you find the price you want.   But so you'll know, I had an 1840 Carson City (CC) silver dollar (the mint closed, no more CC coins minted) and it was worth $40. I thought the guy was kidding me but many others gave me similar prices."

Birmingham,32ylbm,BoogLife,2,Fri Apr 17 20:37:16 2015 UTC,May be a Morgan silver dollar.  They vary in value pretty widely.  On the low end they are just worth the metal weight.  On the high end it can be a LOT more than that.  Fun find though!

As for any accusal of trolling, I'm afraid I simply have to proclaim my innocence and restate that my opinion is my own, and I share its reasoning in threads appropriate to the UAB football controversy.

Trussville is VERY family oriented so you will have to go downtown (Avondale, lake View, Southside) if you want a good bar. Of course if you just absolutely want to stay in the Trussville area and drink/hang out I would say Buffalo Wild Wings or the bowling ally would be your best bet (as lame as that sounds that's about as good as it gets).

But if you like holes in the wall, the people are friendly and you'll make friends fast.  I hang with the hipster crowd, so I usually take it over to the Avondale area, which really isn't a bad drive from this part of Trussville.

The Sheraton has studios in your price range, but everyone says the place smells bad and parking sucks. Gotta weigh your options I suppose. Also, take a look at houses for rent too.

But yes, 280 is the highway most of these complexes you listed will put you near - and the traffic on it is horrendous. Like I'm talking reducing your quality of life if you have to sit in it every day horrendous (I am a drama queen about traffic but hey).  Do you know exactly where you'll be working? If you're working downtown, live downtown. If you're working down Highway 280/31, or in Hoover, etc., then yes, live over there, or as we call it, ""over the mountain"". Red Mountain divides downtown and the suburbs like Vestavia, Homewood, Cahaba Heights. You may also get away with some apartments in Homewood, so don't rule that out entirely.

The over the mountain areas down 280 are rather new and nice for what you pay, but it's a carbon copy of any suburb in the US.  I just moved in to a place in Highland Park a few months ago with some friends, and I pay just over $400 for a very large and well appointed house. Parks and sidewalks everywhere, and a 5-8 minute drive to my office downtown. Being able to walk to bars, restaurants, and groceries makes a huge difference in my overall happiness IMO.

And, as annoying and spam-like as /u/RentMonster is, they may be able to help you out.   The problem with a lot of the properties in the Highland/Avondale/Southside area is that the buildings are old. Many of them have been renovated and cleaned up, but they're still old buildings.

Birmingham,32oulh,bridgwj,2,Wed Apr 15 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"First, Quick tip on the reviews. Most people who are reviewing something are not happy with it. It is very hard to get people who enjoy something to review it. On the other hand, people who are unhappy with something don't need to be convinced and are eager to review it. I'm saying this to point out that reviews are helpful but need to be just one method used for consideration as it could be overwhelmingly negative but still be a good place.  The budget of 400-450 per person is quite good and will be able to get a nice place that fits your needs, in fact we may be able to find something cheaper per person.  I'm not sure if we have helped someone in AmeriCorps but we have helped people in the military, all branches, and many other national service organizations. I'm sure we can help you with everything though.  RentMonster is an Apartment Locator company located here in Birmingham. We help people find the perfect place to fit all the needs of the tenant.  Our service is actually 100% FREE because we charge the apartment companies instead of the tenants.  We help you find the best place for you, we take you to tour the places that fit your needs best and we are there to make sure that the place you choose is the best choice. We are not biased as to where you move to as we get paid regardless of where you choose, because of this unbiased guide we guarantee you'll never want to do it any other way.  All you have to do to get started is call us at 205-440-2345 and if you want to, check out our website at http://RentMonster.net  Edit: forgot to mention, we also help with the application and paperwork so that you are not surprised by anything during this process. We are with you every step of the way.  Our agents go through the process more times in a week than most people will in their lifetimes so we know what to expect and can help ease the frustration of the experience."

Birmingham,32mt0x,stimulatedthought,5,Wed Apr 15 01:19:27 2015 UTC,"Well he isn't wrong, as the members of the board serve the whole system and getting into tribalism about which campus owns which rep is a huge step back and a misunderstanding of how the board works.  The board is in charge of the campuses, not the other way around.  I'm sure some great reform of the system is possible but this tribalism is a huge step back that could eventually rot the system from the inside out."
Birmingham,32mt0x,Ben_Afflock,7,Wed Apr 15 02:58:22 2015 UTC,"Everything you said is 100% correct.   However, what this bill is actually doing is just adding four new members (non being taken away): 2 for UAB and 2 for UAH.   So, UAB and UAH are still underrepresented and still the minority in terms of members of the board. However, simply having vetted representatives allows for more open discussion, as it should be for the largest school system in the state.   You mention tribalism. Well, all the current members of the board are either employees at or have deep ties to Protective Life and Bryant Bank. Also, the current board votes for their own replacements. I hope you can understand how that's problematic for a public institution that has a huge economic impact in the state.   And that's what makes the email from Jimmy Warren so incredulous. He's spinning the situation (he does own a marketing firm) into a ""Us vs Them"" battle, when it's really not. UAB and UAH just want a real voice on the board.   Edit: Also, when Jimmy Warren says ""our funding,"" that's such an inaccurate statement as each school has its own budget. No one is taking money from UA and giving it to UAB, nor is the opposite true either."
Birmingham,32mt0x,vulcans_pants,-5,Wed Apr 15 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think you fully understand what I'm getting at, the board runs the campuses and as such speaks for all of them and manages all of them.  You can't just say ""a member for x school"" because a board member is for the whole system. Otherwise you are running through the steps to destroy the system and have an independent U-H and U-B.  I am not wild about the board self appointing, although they do have to be confirmed by the state senate. I'm open to reforms however let's not pretend the board is persistently independent, because it isn't, even the governor and state superintendent of education are automatically members of the bot.  Mr.Warren makes this ""us vs them"" in regards to the organized vocal minority of uab fans who are making lots of hot air about the bot due to a grudge about a failed sport in their athletic program.  And finally, you are incorrect about the budget, as the board can approve or disapprove spending and budget accordingly. For instance the uabot approved uab soccer facility that cost millions of dollars."
Birmingham,32mt0x,Ben_Afflock,3,Wed Apr 15 15:31:37 2015 UTC,"the board runs the campuses and as such speaks for all of them and manages all of them.   And that's the problem. As the board currently exists, there's an extremely heavy bias toward UA. Maybe the bias is unintentional, maybe it's not, but regardless, more alumni diversity is needed. Also, can the board truly not be biased if the chancellor is a former UA president?   Additionally, I would argue that the Board isn't exactly doing a great job of managing the schools. Academically, the system has failed at raising the profile of its ""flagship"" university (Ask the UA Faculty Senate what they think about the current direction of the school). Also, take a look at the revolving door of presidents at UA in the past few years. UA has a ton of debt as well, which is why they've been aggressively trying to grow their undergraduate class sizes. Speaking of which, the enrollment at UAH has been shrinking.  New voices are needed.      You can't just say ""a member for x school""   And that's not how it would work. The four board members would simply be chosen by the two respective schools. After that, they would be full board members representing the system.       Otherwise you are running through the steps to destroy the system and have an independent U-H and U-B.   And there's nothing wrong with that. If the Board is making decisions that limit each school, would the schools not be better off controlling their own future? The University of South Alabama broke away many decades ago because of meddling from the UA System.       in regards to the organized vocal minority of uab fans who are making lots of hot air about the bot due to a grudge about a failed sport in their athletic program.    Every formal organization at UAB has asked for the removal of Ray Watts and expressed lack of faith in the Board. That is not a vocal minority. Yes, football was the final tipping point, but the much larger issue of representation has been boiling in the background for decades. Also, if it were truly a vocal minority, would the Board be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on PR campaigns? Would they ask the UA Alumni President to motivate the alumni base?      And finally, you are incorrect about the budget, as the board can approve or disapprove spending and budget accordingly. For instance the uabot approved uab soccer facility that cost millions of dollars.   How am I incorrect? Yes, the Board approves the budgets, but there is zero ""profit sharing"" between the schools.

Birmingham,32mt0x,vulcans_pants,-2,Wed Apr 15 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"That is actually not true about South Alabama, specifically here pages 15-18 show that UA was unwilling to promote their extension center and a group of Mobile business men and local politicians helped push this onto George Wallace's desk and he supported it, seeing the intensity of the pro-Mobile delegation.  Thus the first Public University had been founded in Alabama since Montevallo had been chartered. It was much more about the Mobile delegation and its loyal supporters than any malicious behavior by UA.  I think we disagree on the issue. I'll just state my opinion and a brief reasoning and move on. Simply put UAB football had anemic support. I went to at least a dozen home games and several away games. I saw first hand crowds that were tiny, well below any stated attendance.  The program itself had huge issues in making or receiving money and so it put a burden on the institution as being in CUSA wasn't paying the bills despite having a football team. Dozens of high value scholarships every year, travel expenses, coaching and management expenses, recruiting expenses, extra upkeep, etc.  The list goes on and on. I don't think having the football program was accomplishing its intended goals and was very expensive in the process. I don't like that it failed either. But there was no way to end it without massive controversy and Watts handled it poorly to be sure, but it had to be done.   I think UAB basketball will be fine without football and hopefully they will repeat as a Tournament team next year."
Birmingham,32mt0x,Ben_Afflock,2,Wed Apr 15 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"UA was unwilling to promote their extension center   Is that not meddling? UA was unwilling to allow South Alabama to award advanced degrees and start various programs. Thanks for the pdf though. I was going off info from this site, which had similar information.   Again, football was the tipping point, but misgivings with the Board of Trustees and its structure has been an issue for a long time.   And I'll grant you that UAB Football wasn't well supported, especially compared to Alabama and Auburn, but Legion Field will make even a modest crowd look anemic. However, Troy and South Alabama both averaged 17K in attendance this past season, while UAB averaged 21K. Why isn't there an outcry to shutdown Troy and South Alabama? I'm sure your counterpoint will be that UAB is over reporting attendance, to which I say I'm sure Troy and USA and probably ever school does so as well.   Also, when the team doesn't perform well on the field, the coaches are inept, and you don't see the support from the Board, it's hard to build momentum for a relatively young program, especially so in this state. Not to mention that right after UAB had two back-to-back winning seasons, the Board threatened to kill the program, thus killing it's budding momentum.   And yes, UAB Football isn't a money making machine, and while it's the biggest expense in the UAB athletic department, it's also the biggest revenue driver, and ultimately doesn't cost that much in the grand scheme of things. With the elimination of UAB Football, the athletic department doesn't really have that much to ""reinvest"" as has been frequently parroted by Ray Watts.   Football isn't a burden to the university. Yes, the school does have to loft up the athletic department, but we shouldn't confuse the two. And with the elimination of football, the school is removing a viable revenue stream for the athletic department.  If given a proper opportunity (actual support from the Board eg. facilities), UAB Football could be very successful and ultimately raise the profile of the school even more. I point to TCU as an example.   And football does hurt the basketball program. Because it hasn't been well supported in the past (especially from the Board), football has prevented UAB from moving to a better conference with more money and exposure. Now, with no football program, UAB will have to settle for an even lesser conference than CUSA."

He constantly beats his wife along with stolen property charges. Should I have seen this? Probably not, but its that cop's fault for letting me see his information.   His phone number matched, his policy report had the same address he gave me, I found my damned bike and the officer who took my case did nothing. He ignored my calls and promised multiple times to follow up on it. Its not like it was fucking missing, I did all the legwork. And yet they sat on their hands using the $500 as their reasoning for not doing shit.  I pay taxes. I follow the law. I'm not a degenerate piece of shit who's existence is a blight on society and there for I think I have every damn reason to be pissed off at our police.

Why did you just not call the cops and point out your bike on his porch? When was this? Curious about the officers name most of all."
Birmingham,32kqs5,codealaska,3,Tue Apr 14 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"This all happened over the course of December and January. My bike was stolen in December from Five Points where the lock was cut. I reported it that night. Nothing happened until the 19th when I spotted it on Craigslist and tried to buy it. Through emails (and he using Craigslist email instead of his own) he and I talked. The next morning after I spotted it (and screenshotted it) he deleted the post after I emailed him. In my haste, I was too eager to buy it back and he called me a cop. In his emails he accidentally posted his name and I got it. He wanted to sell me a different bike and we continued chatting through texts (where I got his number). He told me to meet him next to this shell gas station and if you go to this there is a apartment complex right next to it. You can literally walk to it.   So I went to south side with all this and the front desk cop called Kennamer who came out and spoke with me and directed the front desk cop to add it to my case file. So Kennamer went back to his office and I sat with that cop while he typed up how I attained all this and when we got to the name, he looked it up and boom, there he was. The phone number on his file matched and the address was right next to the shell like he said he was but I got to get his exact address and door number. After the excitement wore down, the cop told me I wasn't seeing any of this and went back to his report.   Sergeant Kennamer was who spoke with me in the lobby and said he'd go to the apartment later that day, who never did, and kept making excuses about when he'd actually go over there. He's avoided my calls or said he's out of town or this or that.   Sergeant Benning was from another branch of the Birmingham police department. Theft/burglary whatever the proper name is. He said while it is not valued enough to be a felony offense, that he would look into it. Again, I've never heard a word from him. I've called multiple times over the course of weeks to get messages that he's out on a case or out on lunch and he'll call me as soon as he's back.   After I got fed the fuck up with all the misdirection and excuses, I went to his apartment and found the balcony on the other side of the building facing the woods where no one can see it. There in plain fucking sight was my bike on a new lock.  That's how he gets away with all these thefts. When I was walking back past his door, he flew it open and followed me to the end of his building while I walked to the car. I turned around to see him staring me down in the dark.   I don't give a shit if you believe me. You can search my posts, I posted about it during January. I've lost all respect for South side. All I figure now is that's its gone. In the dump somewhere he sold it to another douchebag."
Birmingham,32kqs5,OhNoFiveOh,2,Wed Apr 15 03:49:07 2015 UTC,"Not saying the theft and your loss do not matter,  but it's a misdemeanor. We don't have enough manpower to do a lot of investigative footwork to follow up on every misdemeanor.   Also, with a misdemeanor, and the fact you have all this guy's information,  it falls on YOU to go to the magistrate and sign a warrant for theft of property 3rd. Not us. You have a year and a day to go to 1710 1st Ave North and get the report and take it to the city magistrate, along with all your evidence. We do not do misdemeanor warrants for property crimes, or crimes that do not happen in our presence.

I know my bike is a lot less important than the herion addicts and hit and runs and shootings they have to deal with on a constant basis, which only made it harder to continue to ask ""what do I do next?"" And only to get hopped around the network of the phone lines landing on another desk having to explain my entire story again and again wasting my time and theirs.   If someone had told me what you told me, I would've have done it in a heartbeat. I have Kennamer's personal number when he asked I send over my screenshots over this guy. If he would have just texted me that I would have thanked him and taken the next step.   The reason I'm pissed off is not about a stupid bike (but being a broke college student who depended on it for my job made it greatly important to me) but it was the principle. I begged for help. I did all the legwork. I kept being told how lucky I was to find it and how things were going to be handled and they never were. I was given the run around and never got one bit of help and now the bike is probably gone for good.  You know what is sad? The more cops told me that it was under $500 made me realize something. I should have lied to the cops when I reported it stolen to get anything done. So if I came away with any message from this entire experience is that next bike, it was worth $501.00. Then maybe I'll actually get something back instead of avoided or put on hold for thirty minutes or transfered to another department.   That's why I'm pissed."

I re-updated them with my info, and then at 7am, I finally had a cab show up. This is unacceptable in my opinion."

Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Wed Apr 15 10:37:44 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. I doubt Uber/Lyft and the like will be in the 'Ham anytime soon.  My advice is to call early, and once you find a cabbie who you like who does a good job, get their card, put their number in your phone, and call them directly. That's what /u/bhamcat and I have done with very good results. Conversely, we've waited too long on a busy party night and been stuck waiting for hours."
Birmingham,32lgo6,BlazerMorte,2,Tue Apr 14 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"Sound advice.  I have 4 or 5 cabbie #s in my phone from rides that went well.  With an hour or so notice, they do pretty well.  Uber / Lyft would be ideal, but our city council is scared of anything new (or anything that doesn't line their pockets).  What floored me was all the smug self-satisfaction of the anti-uber crowd here on /r/birmingham when they got kicked out of town.  Why the hell they would be against more transportation options is beyond me."

Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:02:37 2015 UTC,What nuclear option? The nuclear option of requiring their drivers to have insurance?
Birmingham,32lgo6,mixduptransistor,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"I really don't feel like rehashing this yet again.  It wasn't as simple as ""uber drivers aren't insured""."
Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Wed Apr 15 13:04:02 2015 UTC,"Then what was it? And why wouldn't a representative of Uber even show up to discuss it with the city council? The new taxi ordinance (which I read, not sure if you've actually read it) specifically allows hailing from the street, using an app to hail, etc.  IIRC Uber said specifically the requirement to have a taxi license and $1m liability coverage was why they did not start operating."
Birmingham,32lgo6,mixduptransistor,4,Wed Apr 15 14:03:00 2015 UTC,"I read both the old and new taxi ordinances.  There were a few sticking points:   The city wasn't willing to accept Uber's method of insurance.  Uber uses a policy that covers their drivers when they are engaged in Uber business only.  Uber drivers use their personal cars, not fleet vehicles.  When an Uber driver has accepted a rider, they are covered.  When they are driving around on their own time, the Uber policy is not in force, and the driver is covered under their own insurance.  This makes a lot of sense, and is one way Uber keeps costs lower.  The city wanted full time million dollar policies for drivers whether they were ""on the clock"" or not. The city requires each driver to have their own business license.  This is, in my opinion, unnecessary, and a money grab by the city.  Why can't the driver act as an independent, individual contractor, operating under the auspices of a single ""Uber Alabama"" business license? The city requires regular (quarterly?) vehicle inspections.  This makes sense for a taxi fleet that consists of 20 year old Crown Vic's with 300k+ miles on them that are full time, 24x7 fleet vehicles.  I do not think it makes sense for Uber, which has strict requirements on the maximum age of the cars their drivers use part time to carry riders.  Maybe rideshares could have gotten a relaxed schedule?   Anyway, those are just three highlights of areas where the city has regulations that make it impossible for ride share services like Uber and Lyft to operate here."
Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,0,Wed Apr 15 14:17:10 2015 UTC,"Many insurance companies, including State Farm, has said that their policies do NOT cover this type of use. Are they independent contractors, or are they employees? If they were employees I'd be OK with one master license. Uber is trying to have it both ways, it seems. Or, if they're ok with one master license, why not one master insurance policy that is in effect continuously, not piecemeal on/off over the course of a shift? And yeah, business licenses are a ""money grab"" by the city. It's called taxes, and why should Uber be exempt from them but no one else? How is this a burden? If Uber has such strict guidelines, then the inspections should be a breeze.   I think there are probably state level issues, too, since taxis and commercial vehicles are required to have commercial tags. You're not supposed to operate a business with regular, non-commercial license plate registrations.   Uber's entire business model is to just get itself exempted from every regulation that every other business has to operate under. There's no ""technological revolution"" here, just a libertarian/sovereign citizen style ""the law don't apply to me!"" declaration."
Birmingham,32lgo6,mixduptransistor,2,Wed Apr 15 14:56:53 2015 UTC,"Sigh...   State Farm's insurance doesn't have to cover this kind of use.  When the person is just driving around on their own, they are covered by their own insurance.  This is no different than you or me and our usual policies.  If a driver is involved in an accident when they are driving for Uber, the Uber policy covers them, it never even hits the driver's policy.  There is nothing for State Farm, et al, to cover. They are contractors.  Being a contractor doesn't (or shouldn't) mean you need a separate business license.  Software people take on contract coding jobs all the time, and we don't need to get a business license to do so.  I can just fill out a W-9 with my SSN.  Why should drivers be any different?  They still pay taxes on the money they make, just as they would any other kind of income.  Uber would still pay taxes on the business income they earned in the state too, just like Walmart or any other company that operates in Alabama does. (2.a, really) You've injected the insurance question here again.  Part of the reason Uber is able to undercut cabs is that they carry an innovative insurance model that covers their drivers when they are engaged in commercial activities.  This is significantly less expensive than covering all drivers 24x7.  The important thing is that if an Uber driver is involved in an accident while doing Uber business, the 1M policy is in effect.  I think that's fair. How is it a burden?  Driving in and paying for unnecessary inspections costs money.  These inspections might be necessary for an old beat up cab, but I don't think they are for a new, modern, lower mileage car that is only engaged in commercial work for a fraction of the time a cab is.   Uber's technology isn't a huge leap.  Their business model is pretty innovative though.  It does require some changes to the laws, but I, for one, am OK with those changes.  Transportation is a classic case of overregulation leading to decreased competition, decreased quality of service and increased pricing.  Basically, all the things you mentioned are simply not true.  Uber's drivers are covered when they are engaged in commercial activities.  They pay taxes.  Uber pays taxes.  The cars are newer and safer.  The only people that lose if we accommodate Uber or other rideshares are the cabs.  And frankly, after having been left standing on a streetcorner for 2 hours, fuck them, they deserve to be out-competed and destroyed."
Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,-1,Wed Apr 15 15:13:19 2015 UTC,"They don't really keep them from operating, they just keep the companies from making as much money as they would like because they would have to abide by the same rules as the taxi companies.   I've loved using Uber and Lyft in other cities and would be happy to have them here but I haven't seen a compelling argument for why they shouldn't have to follow those rules."
Birmingham,32lgo6,willco17,2,Wed Apr 15 02:21:19 2015 UTC,"Because those rules are stupid, draconian, overly complex and designed to fit a taxi company business model, not Uber/Lyft's business model.  Trying to make the next generation of transportation companies abide by rules designed for the last generation is like cramming a square peg into a cab shaped hole."
Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,-1,Wed Apr 15 10:30:41 2015 UTC,"That's where Uber's tactics are a problem. They could work with officials who make the rules and pave the way to operating in the city. Instead, they seem to come in very contentiously and pitch a fit for not getting exactly what they want.   Again, I'd love for them to be here but they create a lot of their own problems."
Birmingham,32lgo6,willco17,3,Wed Apr 15 14:24:07 2015 UTC,So the solution is to throw out the baby with the bathwater?  Uber is just one company that provides these services.  Our city council slammed the door on all of them in what looks to me an awful lot like an attempt to protect existing businesses.  I agree with you that Uber is a bit assholish.  Being an asshole isn't reason enough to deny the city a much needed service.
Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,-2,Wed Apr 15 14:31:23 2015 UTC,"How did they slam the door? You're making it sound like they banned ridesharing. Nothing is stopping Uber from operating here. The laws as they are written don't work for their business model. Their options are: work on changing the laws, adapt their business to work within the laws, or don't operate here."
Birmingham,32lgo6,willco17,3,Wed Apr 15 15:14:00 2015 UTC,"The laws as written are fundamentally incompatible with any transportation model other than cabs.  The Uber business model is incompatible with our laws, and the latest transportation code changes solidified that.  The city council made sure that Uber, as it exists today, cannot operate here.  They had a chance, while rewriting the code, to make accommodations that would benefit both rideshare companies and the people that live here, but instead they further entrenched the old business model.  You're right.  They have 3 options.  They can't change the laws, the city council already made that clear.  They can't adapt their business to work here, as their business model is what allows them to outcompete cabs.  If they change it to fit, then they are just another shitty cab company.  The last option is the only one left.  And it's our loss."
Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,-1,Wed Apr 15 15:21:44 2015 UTC,"Personally, I was/am anti-ride sharing because it detracts from any movement for mass transportation, which Bham desperately needs.   I'm also not a big fan of more cars on the road. As it is now, people are forced to carpool, which is good."
Birmingham,32lgo6,tackyjacks,2,Tue Apr 14 21:42:18 2015 UTC,"How, exactly does it detract from movements for mass transit?  I would argue that letting a service like Uber come in will ultimately help our transit situation, not the other way around.  The lack of transit options is hurting the downtown economy, which will ultimately be the reason we need transit.  Besides, look at the cities with the best transit in the US.  NYC.  DC, Boston, SF.  All of those cities also have lots of cabs, and all of those cities also have Uber.  It isn't a one or the other proposition. Uber drivers tend to pick cars with good mileage.  Priuses (Priii?) are particulary common.  Better mileage = more profit. Lots of Uber riders carpool.  I don't have data to back this up, but it's probably the majority.  I can't tell you the last time I rode in a cab or an Uber by myself. If you want less cars on the road, I would think you would back Uber, as it lets a whole lot of people share one car instead of having to park everybody's individual cars downtown (which you know is a problem!).   I just don't get it.  Modern cars (better than cabs).  A working dispatch app (better than our cabs).  Cheaper prices.  Faster service.  What's not to love?"
Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:54:18 2015 UTC,"All of the cities with decent transit had it before Uber. We have taxis, which are obviously not enough. Do we want our solution to be more cars on the road and no more options for people who can't afford taxis, or do we want mass transportation for everyone? I doubt we can sustain both.  If people take Uber as opposed to the bus, the bus runs anyway. The damage is done, there's no option on that. There is an option for if you want the Uber car on the road in addition to the bus.  The app system is awesome, I agree. Our buses are unreliable and taxis are shit. However, I can't in good faith support a movement to put more cars on the road at a cost which excludes half the city."
Birmingham,32lgo6,tackyjacks,2,Tue Apr 14 22:02:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  However, Uber is a LOT less expensive than cabs in terms of absolute $$, and even cheaper if you consider the opportunity cost of the time it takes for a cab to show up.  So, wouldn't that open MORE options for lower income people, not less?  Also, as stated above, services like Uber would ultimately mean less cars driving downtown, not more.  With services like UberPool the # of cars are reduced even further, and the system becomes even cheaper and more efficient at the cost of a little time.  If you really want better transit (I would love to see better bussing and a BRT / light rail down the 280 corridor), I think your energy would be better spent pushing for regional transit cooperation and planning than fighting ride sharing services.  For example, have you ever wondered why our bus stops don't have route maps?  It's actually against the law. To put up bus maps.  At bus stops. #WTFCityCouncil."
Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Tue Apr 14 22:32:45 2015 UTC,"Mass transportation in this city has been a joke for over 25 years, and it won't get any better because most of the non-Birmingham municipalities have no interest in contributing. Hamstringing Birmingham residents' options while holding on to the pipe dream of regional cooperation doesn't make any sense."
Birmingham,32lgo6,MisterTito,2,Tue Apr 14 22:41:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think regional cooperation is a pipe dream.  As more people move out of the burbs to downtown, and as the economy down here continues to strengthen, there will come a time when the OTM communities will be begging for closer ties.  All the momentum in this area is downtown, the burbs are already stagnating."
Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:36:15 2015 UTC,"True, but at that point regional cooperation for a functional mass transit system - at least in the city center - won't be as important. If there's an influx of enough residents to tilt the balance like you describe, the tax base will be strong and there will be many, many more paying customers in the system. The system could be self-sustainable, at least for the urban area.  But more so, if there's a lot more people living within the city to make this kind of shift, then there's going to be much more tremendous pressure on the city government to allow Uber/Lyft/etc. Hopefully to the point that council members would start being voted out of office for this backwards thinking bs (that's my pipe dream...)"
Birmingham,32lgo6,MisterTito,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think the city center is the problem.  Nobody really complains about traffic in the city center, it isn't too bad.  The bus coverage (which has its problems, for sure) is decent in the city itself.  Birmingham's big traffic problems are the commuter corridors in / out of the city.  280, I-65, etc.  That's where we need regional transit cooperation if the city center economy is to continue to grow.  People are going to continue to live there, and as the city gets healthier, more and more of them are going to be working here.  Oh, and I agree 100% that more folks living downtown will give us the ability to pressure the city council.  The demographics are changing quickly.  I'd love to see a big upset or two in the next election cycle, see one or two of these people get the boot."
Birmingham,32lgo6,NJWhiskeyHunter,2,Wed Apr 15 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"Uber/Lyft work great in Nashville and Atlanta. Most spots you don't wait more than 5-10 minutes from the time of request.

Currently I am using AT&T Uverse and would like more options for internet and TV service that is not Brighthouse or Charter, both of whom I have used in the past. Birmingham is lacking in competition in the TV and internet markets with only 3 choices. None of which come close to what Google is offering in its other cities as far price and performance.

Birmingham,32idbw,patermortis,-5,Tue Apr 14 14:58:12 2015 UTC,You could have simply called us and it would have cost you nothing and you wouldn't have even had to look. :-)  The majority of the posts on there are not top quality because they are made by amateurs or in some cases companies that don't even exist anymore. There is nothing we can do about that.   Our agents are professionals though and they all receive hands on training directly with the CEO of the company. We provide the absolute most professional and convenient service in the industry.  I'd like you to let us prove that to you the next time you move.
Birmingham,32idbw,RentMonster,3,Tue Apr 14 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"Your claim that ""it would have cost [me] nothing"" is a half truth at best.  I would be paying your fee via a higher rent price by utilizing your service.  I have seen your ads on craigslist, and they offer less information then these ""amateurs"" you speak of.  In other cities that I have lived in or looked at moving to, your kind of business isn't allowed to flood craigslist with spam postings, because the people of those cities moderate the site and/or there are ordinances dictating how rental properties should be advertised.  Instead, here, the true rental market is hidden by these spam posts and rental websites that have inaccurate to even bogus information about the properties.  Instead of the internet making searching for a new home easy and increasing competition, it makes it even more difficult because of this bogus or hidden information, which in turn, no doubt inflates the price to rent."
Birmingham,32idbw,patermortis,-2,Wed Apr 15 02:07:45 2015 UTC,Please give me an example of the market you are referring to.  You absolutely will not pay extra by using us. All of our deals with property companies guarantee the same price as they advertise including specials. In fact we even keep track of the specials so you could even pay less with us.

Birmingham,32isu3,MichaelTunnell,2,Tue Apr 14 06:03:37 2015 UTC,"Trent Butler is conspicously absent while sports anchor Jim Dunaway is doing news anchor duties. Butler was there less than a year, hired to replace Ken Lass."
Birmingham,32isu3,FalconHunter,2,Wed Apr 15 03:24:14 2015 UTC,"So - here's the deal.  Around 2007 (or so) MediaGeneral bought WVTM (NBC13) as part of a package deal of smaller stations that were owned & operated by GE/Universal. MediaGeneral already owned (and butchered) WIAT into a pile of nothingness. FCC rules dictate how many stations you can own in a market. So MG had to sell off WIAT in order to get WVTM - the stipulation from NBC was that all of the stations being sold had to go to the same buyer.   When MediaGeneral took over WVTM, they gutted the 64-person newsroom by 2/3. Layoffs everywhere and people were assigned the work of multiple jobs. Furloughs followed. MG was using the revenue generated by the TV stations to prop up their falling and outdated print division. They also had a failing and overly expensive custom traffic system (for ad tracking) called PILAT which bombed and didn't play nice with the rest of the industry.   WVTM is failing badly (surprise!) because it was so badly run by MG. MG also ran off all of the elite talent that NBC had prior to the acquisition. So MG bought WIAT again recently and had to sell off WVTM.  What you're seeing at WIAT is only going to get much, much worse. Expect to see nearly everyone canned or resigning and watch them appear on other stations.   Expect WVTM to begin to shine once again now that MG is nowhere near them.   MediaGeneral is a plague."
Birmingham,32isu3,Former42Employee,3,Wed Apr 15 15:18:11 2015 UTC,"That's a good run at it, Falconhunter but I happened upon this thread and I figured I'd give everyone a little insight into what happened at WIAT/CBS42.  Lin Televison bought CBS42 from New Vision television in 2013...Media General then bought several of the Lin Media stations in a merger/buyout.  As you mentioned, the FCC wasn't going to allow Media General to have WIAT and WVTM so WVTM was put up for sale and is now free of the scourge of MG.  But the issues at WIAT started during the first sale I mentioned, Then GM Bill Ballard sensed that there were going to be major changes due to the sale and that his job might be in question, so changes were made to try to spread blame around...nothing easier than getting rid of Ken Lass and demoting Mark Prater after football season.(The Bulk of CBS42 viewership comes during that time)  Ballard continued to make stupid changes as though he were a recently caught fish flopping around on the deck until his firing in late 2013.  In comes Helen Swinson from the Weather Channel...along with the resources from Marketing/Research/Consulting firm Magid.  They have a new ""Vision""(Ironic) for CBS42 and soon unveil the WIAT42 brand with a new shiny set(I say soon but this was a process that took months) during this time she fired News Director Bill Payer and hired Rob Martin from WAKA in Montgomery.  WAKA was consistently one of the worst television stations in Alabama during Martins tenure....so why not?  Martin proceeded to hire several of his former employees while demonstrating the same lack of news knowledge and understanding ...driving others to quit, or finally seek employment elsewhere.  Oh, and Meterologist Gene Norman (A part of the Origial Bill Ballard plan) wasn't a part of the Helen Swinson plan so that explains his departure.  Can't for the life of me explain the Trent Butler shift but I'm guessing you'd have to look at the Magid research numbers...as nebulous as they are.  Thoughts and prayers for everyone still there.

Birmingham,32a8lx,eye_en_tee_jay,10,Sun Apr 12 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"If a landlord uses the ""unlawful detainer"" method of eviction, he must give you three (3) days written notice to vacate. If you do not leave, the landlord can sue by filing a complaint against you in court. After you receive a summons to appear in court, you have five (5) days to object in writing to the eviction. If you do not file an objection you can be removed from the dwelling by the Sheriff. If you do object, a hearing will be scheduled to determine your right to possession of the property.  If a landlord uses the ""failure to vacate"" method of eviction, he must give you ten (10) days written notice. This method of eviction applies only to non-payment of rent. If you do not leave the premises within ten (10) days, you can be charged with a misdemeanor. You would then be required to appear in court where you could be fined up to $25 for each day you remained in the dwelling after being given the ten (10) day notice to vacate. source  You're probably looking at the second being exercised."

It's a long drawn out process. Call an attorney familiar with landlord/ tenant law Monday. Your landlord is in violation of the landlord / tenant laws by giving you this notice.

Birmingham,329ggq,freeUAB,3,Sat Apr 11 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"Many, many of the now-shuttered stores went out of business on their own. They just happened to have locations inside Brookwood.   Delia's, Wet Seal, Sbarro, Radio Shack - just to name a few. Lots of stores disappeared last time the venue was remodeled as well - Happy Chinese, Barnie's Coffee, and shortly after, The Bombay Co.   American Eagle closed their Brookwood and Summit locations.   And the rent going up is probably to force out the less-than-attractive businesses that always tend to appear (like the ethnic-specific nail salon and ethnic-focused clothing stores.) Belk at Brookwood needs to remodel and update - they feel more like a Burlington Coat Factory than a Belk. Even Sears at the Galleria is more attractive than that location. Macy's is still appealing, though.   The difference between Century Plaza and Brookwood is clientele, location, and potential. With everything that's moved into the area recently (Fresh Market, Target, DSW) I don't expect that BWV will see the same fate as Century Plaza. Even the restaurants out front are doing well (Brio, Cocina Superior, Five Guys, Jason's) so it's just the calm before the remodel storm."

If that is true, I guess I understand what they are trying to do, but I'm still unemployed from the situation so I am not a happy camper."

They list about 25 mall properties in several states. Most of them have a standard array of chain mall stores like Aero and none of them look to be especially ""unique."" They call BWV one of their ""Mixed Use"" properties.  The dining theater is often mentioned, and the beer license. The early announcements (BBJ?) said something about a bowling alley too, in the Gus Mayer catacombs.   It's evident Cypress wants to swap out a bunch of stores and they announced some remodeling along the restaurant row. The remaining businesses got a memo about redecorating though I don't have specifics.  I hate /u/cannibananabal lost his job. Which restaurant has closed?"

Birmingham,326127,mattezell,0,Sat Apr 11 01:28:12 2015 UTC,"Just to let y'all know what's going on: We had crawfish cooking lessons on Thursday from someone who earns their living cooking them.  We bought them fresh; those crawfish in the bags are alive. This picture was taken immediately after delivery.  This is how they're packaged and delivered.  We cook them the right way, which includes purging them prior to cooking.  Some places don't do that, and it's gross if you don't.  In case you haven't been in a while, I wanted to let y'all know that as of February, we have an entirely new staff, including a new executive chef who has written a whole new menu.  DFC did suck ass before, but now, instead of boxed and bagged food, we buy fresh veg, great meats like Conecuh brand sausage, grits from McEwen and sons and we have fish delivered daily from Greg Abrams seafood.  The fish we receive are 24 hours or less out of the gulf.  I know a lot of places say that, but as a person who works in the kitchen there, I can honestly say that we do that.  If you haven't been in a while, give it a shot.  While you're there, ask for Ric (he's our new chef) and talk to him about the food. I am not invested in the restaurant (other than the fact that I work part time there), but didn't think it was fair to judge the people who are busting their asses now to fix what people who no longer work there completely fucked up."

Birmingham,326679,amyorainbow74,1 point,Sat Apr 11 05:08:25 2015 UTC,"You are correct! If you are coming from Birmingham on Hwy 280, you can either take a left at the light at Hwy 41 and go all the way to the end of the road and then take a right and you will head up the mountain right to it. If you go on down to the light at Hwy 43 and make a left, you would go all the way to the intersection after the railroad tracks. There will be a little store on your left. Make a left at that intersection and follow 25 up the mountain until you see the spot. The only thing that may ruin picnic plans there are the cyclists and bikers. I'm not sure when they start but they usually go up one side and come down the other. You can stop and spend some time there and then either go to the Vandiver Park or even venture down to Morgan Creek Winery in Harpersville. If you have any other questions, just let know!"

Birmingham,320tnp,JayJose,-6,Fri Apr 10 07:04:37 2015 UTC,Theres no way that game was sold out based on the pics I saw. I wanted to go last night and they gave me that bullshit about being sold out. Makes perfect sense as they havent seemed to be able to get their act together since they opened that place. Games were better at the Met... and i live in southside..
Birmingham,320tnp,bhamned,2,Fri Apr 10 13:35:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it was pretty crowded. Maybe they didn't sell all the seats in case the staff would have been overwhelmed? The vendors didn't have their act completely together yet."
Birmingham,320tnp,AUChris03,2,Fri Apr 10 14:18:37 2015 UTC,it was definitely sold out. lots of empty seats when the game started but filled in around 7:30 - 8:00.  would love to know your reasons for games being better at the Met.
Birmingham,320tnp,bosshawk1,-1,Fri Apr 10 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"I like the new park, dont get me wrong, but I always looked at games running smoother. Plus, it was kind of nice to watch a quiet game without the outside noise. It would be real nice to not have to hear ambulances and helicopters all night. Not to mention the fucking trains combined with the angry concessions dicks, doubling the price of Thirsty Thursday, and thats pretty much why games were better at the met. That said, I am still going to go to games this season."
Birmingham,320tnp,bhamned,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:20:43 2015 UTC,"I've never had a problem with the outside noise. I mean, you're inside a ballpark with the announcer talking over the loud speaker and random cheers/chants coming from them too.  They didn't double the price of thirsty Thursday either, they just eliminated the option for a 12oz for $1. It's now a 16-20oz for $2 which was also a choice at the met.   The concessions can be a pain though depending on the crowds, not disputing that."
Birmingham,320tnp,tackyjacks,2,Fri Apr 10 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"You do realize they consider season tickets to be present, whether the person enters the gate or not. All stadiums do this."
Birmingham,320tnp,bhamned,0,Mon Apr 13 01:51:36 2015 UTC,I am aware of this. Wouldnt be an issue if when designing the park they didnt completely screw over GA tickets. Montgomery even has a better GA area by capacity. Then again this was bound to happen when you move to a smaller venue from the met and focus most of your effort on higher income customers.

My neighbor got broken into, but then again my house in Shelby County got broken into a couple of years ago, too.

Birmingham,31v5q9,bosshawk1,2,Wed Apr 8 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"Bought a house on 8th Ave last year there. Lots of families. As with anywhere, don't leave valuables in plain sight and take the 0.5 seconds required to lock doors."
Birmingham,31v5q9,mixduptransistor,2,Wed Apr 8 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally don't get people who leave valuable stuff in their cars and then complain about them getting stolen and acting like we live in Beirut.  There was a car burglary ring in Chelsea, Pelham, Hoover, and Alabaster last year. All areas that conventional wisdom would say are ""safer"" than South Avondale/Forest Park."

This is just off the top of my head in the past 3-4 months. For some reason, these very serious crimes don't scare anyone away from Mountain Brook. Yet when any crime happens in Avondale--people freak out. This double standard is incredibly frustrating, but luckily seems to be dissipating.   As long as you're careful, the area is as safe as anywhere. I have friends who have lived in Avondale for years with no problem. I've lived in various suburbs, and now live in  Highland Park. The only place I've been a victim of a crime was in Homewood (Edgewood area--car broken into)."

We took chase and he pulls a gun on us...so we quickly abandoned chase.  I would love to say that I form takled the fucker, retrieved the purse and then held him there til authorities arrived, but a purse is a purse.  You can buy another one. You can cancel a credit card and you can get another license.  Anyway, I do have a friend who's girlfriend lives right behind Avondale brewery and she loves it.  She walks around on the strip area from place to place at night with no problem.  You just have to be aware of your surroundings I guess."

Birmingham,31sa1i,john_snuu,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:06:05 2015 UTC,There's a prominent building just to the east of the financial district (called the Stonewall building I believe) that's been abandoned and for sale for a long time. Something needs to be done with it.
Birmingham,31sa1i,dreed18,2,Wed Apr 8 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"I am usually the last to jump on the bandwagon of trying to stop development, and I wouldn't actually try to stop this either. I understand that specific locations have factors that result in their selection (proximity to offices/jobs, maybe they already owned part/all of the land, asking price for other parcels).   I would just hope that the city, development groups like REV Birmingham and the BBA, and the developers themselves would work to keep local flavor and businesses around instead of just turning the city center into a dense suburb full of chain restaurants and apartments.  the AL.com reporter did say later in the comments on the al.com article that the developer said that Rocky's might stay in the new building, so that is encouraging."
Birmingham,31sa1i,mixduptransistor,5,Tue Apr 7 20:08:22 2015 UTC,"This is privately led. REV, BBA, and the City really didn't do anything here."
Birmingham,31sa1i,Cardnil,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:11:28 2015 UTC,"And that is part of the problem. The city and neighborhood organizations should be involved in potential developments and working to direct, as much as is possible and feasible, where and what happens."
Birmingham,31sa1i,mixduptransistor,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:21:56 2015 UTC,What neighborhood organizations are you referring to? From what I understand Birmingham has no formal neighborhood boundries  (in fact some folks would consider this downtown.)  I'm asking out of pure naivete. I'm not trying to counter your assertion that development of this scale should have citizen involvement.
Birmingham,31sa1i,StumbleBees,4,Tue Apr 7 21:30:57 2015 UTC,"There are 99 official neighborhoods, each with official boundaries and neighborhood associations. Additionally, some (like Five Points South) also have merchant associations as well. I don't think the merchant associations have any official standing within the city's government, other than that of hyper-local chamber of commerce, but the neighborhood associations have officers that are elected by residents and have input into zoning and design issues and requests."
Birmingham,31sa1i,mixduptransistor,2,Tue Apr 7 21:39:57 2015 UTC,Oh. I thought that there were no official ones. That seems to be an incredibly high number. Thank you.

Birmingham,31sa1i,StumbleBees,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:57:43 2015 UTC,"It is a high number. The number of official neighborhoods and their governing boards is a source of a lot of grumbling, especially because the City often pays for representatives of every neighborhood to go to conferences."

Birmingham,31sa1i,WarriorHealer,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:34:48 2015 UTC,They should have regular meetings with the various developers around town to find out what is on the radar and to let their views and desires be known.

Birmingham,31sa1i,roboticarm,6,Tue Apr 7 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"Rev is good. They are trying to bring the city into the 21st century. The BBA is filled with old men and is funded by businesses and government and has about 15 or 20 full time staff. However, their President Brian Hilson is a lifelong Huntsville resident and has been promoting Huntsville like crazy at national and international events. Various Birmingham city officials have noted that. In addition, the BBA elected Ray Watts as its chair elect 2 weeks after the UAB situation began. They have a budget of millions, and yet can't point to a single businesses or job they have brought to the city since their formation a few years ago."
Birmingham,31sa1i,bosshawk1,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:08:55 2015 UTC,"This isn't like globo-gym or mondo-burger coming in and stripping away all of the bham character.    Actually, that's exactly what it is. The developers are already leasing but Rocky's and Stillwater didn't find out until the article was published in the newspaper? And the developers have said they are looking for ""fast casual"" restaurants, meaning stuff like Chipotle or El Pollo Loco, not bars or hole in the wall Italian places.  I'll eat my hat if there is a business in this new development that isn't either owned by or a franchise of an out-of-state company."
Birmingham,31sa1i,mixduptransistor,10,Wed Apr 8 05:46:38 2015 UTC,Fucking hell... Just leave Stillwater alone. It is my favorite dirty ass hole in the wall bar and has my favorite bartender. I would much rather keep my bar than see anything resembling that building.

Birmingham,31sa1i,WarriorHealer,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"Well, there are prelease signs for the new development up on the current building.  That doesn't mean it is all a done deal, but it doesn't bode well either.  The current buildings aren't worth saving, there's nothing significant about them other than the occupants.  They are old, run down and sitting on what has become prime real estate.   I really hope they find a new location.

Birmingham,31sa1i,fojoi,0,Tue Apr 7 23:15:14 2015 UTC,Find me some beautiful semi-attached or free-standing decks.  The deck could be beautiful if you want to pay more for it.  Christ.  Can no one be happy?  It's providing much-needed primary care infrastructure.  God fucking forbid the parking deck is the wrong color of shitty federal beige. Holy cock lickers.
Birmingham,31sa1i,WarriorHealer,3,Wed Apr 8 15:19:11 2015 UTC,"There are plenty. Look at the ones in the middle of downtown. Williams-Blackstock did a good job with the public parking deck down there. St. Vincents is huge, but it is designed to look like it is part of the building. It carries the same lines as the habitable building and is brick. Also, this is only helping the VA, not anyone who is living or working around here. GA architects did a great job with children's hospital parking deck. It is a parking deck, but that is no excuse to not put fenestration and to make it blend."

Nonetheless, if you can't afford parking, then that's either a you or a UAB issue.   If UAB is pricing people out of convenient parking, it's not up to the non-UAB properties to bear that burden.  Or, if you can't afford parking then maybe you should find other means of transportation."

Birmingham,31sa1i,MisterTito,3,Wed Apr 8 11:36:15 2015 UTC,"Do you have a parking permit from UAB? If not, you're part of the problem.  The only people who have trouble parking at UAB are people who don't want to pay for it.  Edit: Downvote all you want, but UAB has ample parking for its students, employees, and patients. If you want to park, for free, within a block of whatever you're doing then working or going to school at an urban university may not be for you."
Birmingham,31sa1i,mixduptransistor,9,Wed Apr 8 14:38:44 2015 UTC,"The world must seem such a white and black place to you.  I work 8 hours a week at UAB (Wed/Thurs mornings) and walk or work from home 80% of the time. Sometimes when I need to bring my laptop in, or stuff for potluck lunches, or when it's super cold or storming, I drive. When I inquired into a parking pass (2 years ago) I was told the wait list to park on campus within a 6 block radius of my office building was 5 years. And a cool ~$60/month for a spot that I would use twice a month. The off-campus lots are the same distance as my home so they make no sense. So yep, I use the meters (and feed them), but I prefer the dead ones.   UAB has several surface parking lots that are underutilized in their current surface state. Converting a few of these to garages would enormously help the situation.   EDIT UAB does not have ample parking for it's employees or students. Can't comment on patients really, not my forte. I went to GA Tech for undergrad (in the middle of Atlanta) so I'm use to walking and urban parking practices. UAB does not have it's shit together for parking at all. It undercharges for shitty parking and lets the problem get worse and worse. Start charging more and build more garages on the surface lots. Problem partially solved. GA Tech was $700 a year (I've heard it's now more like $850) for parking, but students and employees never complained about parking issues like their UAB counterparts."
Birmingham,31sa1i,aerinjl1,2,Tue Apr 7 20:41:08 2015 UTC,"And a cool ~$60/month for a spot that I would use twice a month.    I work at UAB. There are remote parking decks for around $10 a month. It sucks to ride the shuttle, but that pass doubles as a place to park for Baron's ballgames."
Birmingham,31sa1i,feralkitten,2,Tue Apr 7 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"I know about the remote decks. If you will re-read the original post, I state they are practically the same distance from my office as my home is. That doesn't help me on the few mornings that walking is not a great option.   My co-worker is in Zeigler and uses the remote lot (the one right by 65) and shuttle system and her experience has been awful. Most morning up to 2 or even three shuttles will pass their lot because they are already full from the other lots. Her commute should only be 20 minutes but she has to schedule an hour because of how unreliable to shuttles are."
Birmingham,31sa1i,aerinjl1,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:27:45 2015 UTC,remote lot (the one right by 65) and shuttle system and her experience has been awful.   I did it for 2+ years before getting a parking spot. I had 2-3 bad experiences in total.
Birmingham,31sa1i,feralkitten,2,Wed Apr 8 12:45:43 2015 UTC,Agree with your edit.  UAB did not have ample parking for its students when I last attended in  in 2004 and it certainly does not now.
Birmingham,31sa1i,Biggame34,0,Wed Apr 8 12:59:16 2015 UTC,"Ride the bus. UAB just implemented its own bus system, and there is DART and the Max. If you live that close, you should be able to ride the bus.  And FYI if they ""converted"" surface lots to decks, that $50 a month for a spot would be more expensive.  Money doesn't grow on trees, and the implementation of the Blazer Express is a huge improvement and brings UAB into the modern age of urban campuses."
Birmingham,31sa1i,mixduptransistor,2,Wed Apr 8 03:16:26 2015 UTC,supply and demand tho...   he's not wrong. there should be more and decks and better parking. And UAB needs a lot to come into the modern age of urban campuses... whatever that means.
Birmingham,31sa1i,PM_Ur_Bits,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:50:00 2015 UTC,All they have to do is start charging students more than 100 a year for parking.  50 for parking a month would help a lot.   Parking decks cost ridiculous amounts of money to build; much more than the cost of a bus system.   Universities would much rather not build them if possible.
Birmingham,31sa1i,akci,2,Wed Apr 8 01:08:09 2015 UTC,"I got away without buying one for most of my time at the BEC, but mainly because parking was great on the street over there at the time I attended."

I was walking on 21st this morning and the line to get into the Kirklin Clinic Parking Garage was literally 3 blocks long on 21st, so almost 4 blocks long. It is routinely backed up though this morning was extreme.  I sometimes need to run to the School or Public Health for 15 min and the pay level of the garage right there is full 90% of the time.  I mean, in some ways it's great because it means there are more people at UAB, but I see no signs of the leadership working or thinking about solutions."

Are they counting infant mortality in only babies that live in Jefferson county or are born within in the county limits. Because if it is the latter - I am not entirely surprised the number is higher then the national average as any women with a complicated pregnancy or a fetal anomalies will most likely be seen and deliver at UAB if they live in the state. That could be skewing the numbers.

They have things like Stouffer's lasagna in the freezers, as well as homemade casseroles.  You never really know exactly how many people are coming, so the people who work there can help you out with that.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner 365 days a year.  We went Christmas morning and made 4 kinds of soup with all the fixings for everyone.  Once there were a bunch of teenagers making spaghetti and homemade brownies.  We also pitch in and wash dishes (they have 2 dishwashers), put dishes away and do general cleaning in the kitchen.

Birmingham,31pdrq,threewholemarijuanas,3,Tue Apr 7 07:07:37 2015 UTC,"They sponsor just about every nonprofit event possible. My employer wouldn't have a Birmingham office without massive donations from EBSCO.   This is all to say, I'm a fan."
Birmingham,31pdrq,tackyjacks,2,Tue Apr 7 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"Echoing that it all depends on the division and manager. I worked there for a few years and got the hell out, because the job was a dead-end and interacting with management was like being in an abusive relationship. The culture was toxic, and there was a distinct trend of only mid-level managers being female, all higher-ups male--definite glass ceiling no one seemed interested in challenging. Highly motivated employees were routinely targeted by management as threats, which led to a culture of complacency, and yearly reviews were complete fairy tales. But this was all at the Mount Laurel location (beautiful neighborhood, I'll say that). Anyone I met who had a good experience with the company without fail worked at main headquarters down 280. Two very different cultures--my division was moved there temporarily during a renovation, and it was a complete shock rubbing elbows with EBSCO employees who didn't seem completely cowed and depressed by the company.   It takes a while of applying to get an interview in most cases, but HR sometimes will consider you for a different position than you applied for once you're there--just don't let them place you at the Mount Laurel office."

Birmingham,31nhpj,WetNeon,3,Tue Apr 7 23:13:33 2015 UTC,As /u/frenchtoastking17 pointed out there are subreddits for all the major music festivals so why not this one? There are going to be a lot of people that will be at the festival that don't live in Birmingham and are not going to subscribe to /r/birmingham just to hopefully get updates on the festival.  It makes sense to have all the info in one place.
Birmingham,31nhpj,frenchtoastking17,4,Tue Apr 7 23:11:02 2015 UTC,"You could if you'd like. A dedicated subreddit is obviously more in depth though.   Lots of established festivals have subreddits, so this isn't really anything out of the ordinary. It also will hopefully allow us to avoid virtually meaningless posts written only to generate hype."

Birmingham,31lm8v,gradmole,3,Mon Apr 6 14:16:07 2015 UTC,Sad truth time: I think your best bet is going to be Whole Foods. (And sometimes they run out of stuff so I'd call ahead if you're willing to go that route)
Birmingham,31lm8v,lungpaste,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:54:55 2015 UTC,"Publix has pancetta, but I'll give Whole Foods a call. Unfortunately I only get to Bham from Tuacaloosa once a week to teach :/"

Birmingham,31lm8v,caldwellesq,2,Mon Apr 6 14:30:45 2015 UTC,"Vittoria's space has been combined with Bettola. I was hoping they'd keep some of Vittoria's menu items, but that did not appear to be the case last time I went.

The scones and tea are delicious. They have a three-tier tea service for about $20 per person.. It's more food than you can possibly eat. You get a pot of tea of your choice, a scone, and trio of tea sandwiches, a trio of desserts, and fruit. And it's all brought out on a really cute three-tier service.   They also have a whole bunch of other things to choose from (like if you only want scones, or only want the sandwiches) .. and they also serve actual food if you want a filling lunch. Everything is really well made and the ladies there are super friendly. I would highly recommend it!"

Birmingham,31brx3,not_willsmith,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:57:28 2015 UTC,Ok. I just kind of assumed they were the only Pilleteri's in town that would be interested in opening a brewery (and have the capital for it).
Birmingham,31brx3,mindshadow,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:59:11 2015 UTC,GREAT place.  Wonderful meat selection and sandwiches.  Love the way the place smells when I walk in to it.  Breakfast sausage is the best!

They do a weekly (I think) Butcher's box that comes with an assortment of meats. New York Butcher is in Cahaba Heights as well.   Seafood Market: There's several. I used to buy my fish from V. Richards, but since it closed, I'll start trying the Fish Market in Southside.   Farmer's Markets: The biggest one, I believe, is the Alabama Farmer's Market on Finley Avenue. It's open year round. Pepper Place Farmer's Market begins April 11, and is very popular."

Birmingham,31ayae,z95,11,Fri Apr 3 12:47:20 2015 UTC,Railroad park for sure. Plenty of green space to run around and a playground too.   There's a taco truck around the corner at 14th St and 1st Ave N that I highly recommend.   Edit: taco truck rolls away at 2:00.

Birmingham,31ayae,southsam,4,Mon Apr 6 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, Railroad Park is the answer.  As far as restaurants--when are you stopping by?  There are many restaurants downtown (e.g., Yo Mama's), but they are only open during the week for lunch (11 - 2ish)."
Birmingham,31ayae,caldwellesq,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:15:09 2015 UTC,"We'll be there for a late lunch (sometime between 1 and 4, depending on traffic and the ""kid"" factor).  Thanks for mentioning this. I did notice on Yelp that Yo Mama's is only open til 2:30 so I'll do a more refined search when we get closer."
Birmingham,31ayae,caldwellesq,4,Fri Apr 3 14:39:41 2015 UTC,"If you miss peak lunchtime, try El Barrio. It's downtown, and really good Mexican. If you hit lunchtime, I'd suggest Trattoria Centrale--very affordable and incredibly delicious roman-style pizza, daily specials, pasta, etc. Brick & Tin downtown is across the street from Trattoria and has really good sandwiches/soups/salads/bread pudding."
Birmingham,31ayae,vulcans_pants,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:00:28 2015 UTC,"If Paramount is open, your kid might enjoy the arcade games. You'll want to get there before the afternoon/night bar crowd though.   The food is decent too."

Birmingham,31ayae,Tauntsnake,3,Fri Apr 3 13:00:26 2015 UTC,In case you haven't heard.  railroad Park.
Birmingham,31ayae,xtraac,3,Fri Apr 3 13:43:40 2015 UTC,Railroad Park
Birmingham,31ayae,jdew666,5,Fri Apr 3 13:00:33 2015 UTC,Option 2 is homewood central park. This park has more of a playground for kids. Railroad park is cooler but this park might be a little more kid friendly plus you could eat at saws on oxmoor rd (only location with ribs) or try little donkey and then hit up steel city pops. (Both really close to the park) Plus there's the downtown homewood area with a toy store and pet store and some other stores that are fun.
Birmingham,31ayae,jdew666,3,Fri Apr 3 14:19:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the alternate option.  We're about to head towards Birmingham and we'll research it on the drive.
Birmingham,31ayae,Robotseatguitar,2,Fri Apr 3 16:42:10 2015 UTC,What'd you end up doing?
Birmingham,31ayae,caldwellesq,2,Sat Apr 4 18:20:54 2015 UTC,We had an early dinner at Saw's (got in a little later than planned)  and then walked around Railroad Park.  The weather was beautiful.  Hopefully we'll be back soon and we can check out Homewood Central Park.  We loved your city!
Birmingham,31ayae,Robotseatguitar,2,Sat Apr 4 22:53:32 2015 UTC,"I second this option because it is more kid friendly, and you can't beat little donkey and steel city pops.  THe kids menu at little donkey is a mucha lucha mask that you can color and wear!!!"
Birmingham,31ayae,jdew666,6,Fri Apr 3 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"Disagree that Homewood Central Park is more kid-friendly than RR Park. I've been to both parks many times, and see plenty of kids at each. Both parks are great, but I prefer RR Park.    That being said, Homewood's commercial district is cute and you will likely see lots of families in the area. Contrarily, any downtown lunch spot will be filled mostly with professionals. If you do go to Homewood--I'd suggest Saw's BBQ. Little Donkey has been a huge disappointment in my experience."
Birmingham,31ayae,caldwellesq,2,Fri Apr 3 15:30:34 2015 UTC,"have only been to LD once, but we enjoyed it.  Going to saw's for the first time today. Suggestions?"
Birmingham,31ayae,mamitapreciosa,2,Fri Apr 3 16:30:52 2015 UTC,"The ribs if you're doing the homewood location. They also have a rib and sandwich combo there that comes with 1 rib, 1 sandwich, 1 side, and a drink. The chicken sandwich with white bbq sauce is great. All the sides are good too. Mac and cheese and pink eye peas are great. The homewood location gets no love from most people but I think it's the easiest to get in and out of (5 minutes to 65) and the only one with ribs."
Birmingham,31ayae,its_john_k,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"The reason to go to Homewood Saw's is for the ribs and mac n cheese, which the other locations do not offer. The ribs are excellent. The mac n cheese has been inconsistent, but when it's on, it's on.   But yeah, I prefer the Soul Kitchen. The pork n greens, shrimp n grits, and sweet tea fried chicken sandwich are all killer, and you can't get any of them in Homewood."
Birmingham,31ayae,ruffyen,2,Fri Apr 3 17:34:25 2015 UTC,"railroad park is closest to the I20/59 interstate and there are a couple of meat and three places close by too. Sweet Tea restaurant on 21st st south and 3rd Ave South Railroad Park has water features, a small lunchbox spot under the pavillion, a playground, and as a bonus, the new REGIONS FIELD home of the Birmingham Barons baseball team.  It's a nice area to stroll around in, and your little one will FALL OUT once back in the car :)"

Birmingham,3191ip,mixduptransistor,2,Fri Apr 3 16:48:35 2015 UTC,I guess I can see the female angle but why would this discriminate against minorities?
Birmingham,3191ip,southsam,3,Fri Apr 3 17:42:42 2015 UTC,Blacks make up ~12% of the population so if anything they are over represented.    Math and logic; how do they work?
Birmingham,3191ip,buttcobra,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:39:03 2015 UTC,"Assuming that playing some video game is the only qualification ( because that's the only variable that we have and because it's what you are basing your RACISM accusation on), how would a metric where blacks are OVER REPRESENTED  mean that a greater proportion of blacks than whites will be rejected?  If anything it means that a greater percentage of whites will be rejected.    My guess is that you saw OMG ONLY 15% OF PLAYERS ARE BLACK, and didn't realize that that is actually high compared to the black population (which is why you said they couldn't afford xboxes)"
Birmingham,3191ip,buttcobra,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:59:28 2015 UTC,"~12% of the population, 15% of the players in the game.    That's over represented.    Sorry you are bad at math and critical thinking."
Birmingham,3191ip,buttcobra,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:08:23 2015 UTC,The only qualification that we know of for this job is being a Destiny player (which i assume is some vidyagame).  You specifically said that forcing the applicant to be a destiny player would be discriminatory because blacks only make up 15% of the player base for the game   I also saw a poll (albeit unscientific) on a gaming site that showed that blacks only make up about 15% of destiny's user base. So based on this the hiring requirements are excluding them I would guess.   This is not discriminatory because they are over represented relative to their total population.  As for the rest of the requirements... I dont know.  Saying that being a vidyagamer is holding black applicants back though is silly.
Birmingham,3191ip,buttcobra,3,Fri Apr 3 18:30:44 2015 UTC,"You have no idea if this screens out a 'protected class' at a rate that is 80% of a group hired at the highest rate.    For you to reach that conclusion you would have to assume that none of the other players in the game are asian, arab, latino, natives or whatever other 'protected classes' HR people dreamed up.    Since blacks make up 15% of the players that would mean that Asians/Latinos/etc can only make up 5% of the players.    I don't think you have thought this through"
Birmingham,3191ip,buttcobra,1 point,Sun Apr 5 05:10:37 2015 UTC,"If the job posting said something like ""must like Tyler Perry movies"" would you be upset?  Both are dumb things to be upset about, btw. If that's what a company looks for, race and gender shouldn't be an issue. Is it the company's fault more black people and women don't play Destiny?"

There was lots of support from the democratic party affiliated voter base (though not unilateral) for lobbying for the DNC. We didn't have the infrastructure, we didn't have the facilities (by comparison to other candidates), and we spent $275,000 dollars of taxpayer money to hire people that were supposed to help us get that convention.   Instead, we have nothing. And don't say ""recognition"" or ""we're on the map now."" There are better uses for $275,000 in the city and county besides hiring ""consultants"" to essentially jump up and down and cry ""PICK ME! PICK ME!""  Additionally, party makeup in the area should be irrelevant to the selection. Huntsville is more diverse anyway."
Birmingham,314ik0,FalconHunter,2,Thu Apr 2 13:16:30 2015 UTC,"Everything in your post is 100% correct EXCEPT for the part about Huntsville.   They wasted $275k for no reason. We were never going to get the DNC. No way, no how.   The officials kept saying, we'll build the convention dome if we get this.   News to idiots who run B'ham: You have to build the facility and show it off before they will come.

Birmingham,314ik0,datraceman,3,Thu Apr 2 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"Huntsville is more diverse? Really? A metro area represented by two of the most conservative Republicans in Congress is more diverse than a metro area represented by a Democrat and a Republican? Represented by some of the most conservative Republicans but also the only openly gay Representative in the Alabama Legislature?  And if you think we got ""nothing"" out of the effort to win the DNC, then you should get your head out of the sand. We got our name out there, it brought the city and businesses together, and it showed that we could work together to put something like that proposal together, among other things.  You never advance at all if you don't try. The DNC was a long stretch, but it was somewhat reasonable. And now it will result in Birmingham going for obtainable goals that still move us forward like the World Games and a Presidential Debate."

Huntsville is a melting pot of diversity and culture from not only around the US, but also around the world. I lived there for 14 years and return there regularly. Yes. Huntsville is more diverse.  If you're talking politically diverse, that's something different. Then again, if you're a politician, you want a visual that represents all cultures and backgrounds when you're portraying yourself as a candidate for the leader of the free world. (I can give you an example of this in action if you like.)   We got our name out there   Yeah, and we got our name out there with much more conversation and proliferation with the shutdown of UAB's football program. I don't know what kind of dreamland you live in, but our bid for the DNC was a waste of taxpayer money. Or, as you stated in different words - an expensive foray into attention getting. Congrats! Wasteful spending at it's finest. If you wanted popularity, a non-political tourism campaign would have been a better use of that money. Instead, we paid someone $275k to ""try hard.""   it brought the city and businesses together   Yeah, I'm gonna need concrete proof of that.    ... it showed that we could work together to put something like that proposal together, among other things.   Attend a City Council meeting or three. What you're citing as some kind of landmark achievement is nothing more than daily fluff over there.    You never advance at all if you don't try.   Free The Hops has done more to advance the city than a failed attention whoring bid for something that isn't relevant.

I'm not really going to get into a pissing match about this, but honest to God if you think Huntsville is ""more diverse"" you need to spend about an hour on the UAB campus to see the types of folks who walk by. A great spot is on the corner between UAB Hospital and the VA Hospital."

You're correct about UAB, but you have one important problem - those are students (and teachers/medical staff, sure.) They're also concentrated to UAB. What about everything else? What do you see if you stand in West Birmingham? North? East? I've spent many hours on many of the streets in and around the metro area (I also have access to census data and demographics data.)   There's no pissing match to be had - Huntsville is more diverse. You don't have to take my word for it - go spend a week up there and make sure to check everything out, including the sprawling Industrial park as well as all of the industry along Hwy 20.

It's a beautiful outdoors space, and the place has great cocktails and amazing food at a reasonable price (Most entrees are under $20). Don't let the name turn you off--the place is pure class.   Bettola (Italian) has recently expanded, and seems to be much improved. While the food has always been good, it has suffered from consistency issues and occasionally poor service.  I went a few weeks ago and had about a perfect dinner as you could ask for. James Lewis--the owner--was running the kitchen, so that may have something to do with it.

Birmingham,30y2q7,daddyfatsax,12,Tue Mar 31 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"Obviously Councilor Austin has no real idea what he's talking about. There is zero residential fiber available in the city of Birmingham.  Of course there is commercial fiber. For the right price you can get fiber anywhere in the country.  The real problem, though, is that the city and county always want their ""cut"" and want business to flow through connected insiders. Google isn't going to come here because of the byzantine permitting processes and requirements that would be put on by the city. Plus, places like Nashville have consolidated metro governments (helps with the bureaucracy) and places like Atlanta have extremely rich neighborhoods (Gigapower and Google Fiber will only be available in rich suburbs like Sandy Springs).  And then the municipal fiber thing like Chattanooga is problematic because Chattanooga's city government owns the electric utility, so they already have rights of way and physical infrastructure to every structure in the city.   Some common sense things that the city should be doing is requiring at least empty conduit if not dark fiber be buried in streets every time they are dug up, no matter the project (IE: if they dig up a street to fix the sewer, bury some fiber even if it's unused when they are done. the fiber is super cheap, the cost is in digging up the road in the first place). They also should work to streamline the permitting and franchise process (in partnership with the county and the state) and even working with neighboring cities so that Google could come in with one franchise and permit agreement and blanket the whole county, regardless of city limits."
Birmingham,30y2q7,mixduptransistor,11,Wed Apr 1 01:58:14 2015 UTC,"He said we have fiber in the city, but do any ISPs actually use it?"
Birmingham,30y2q7,vulcans_pants,8,Tue Mar 31 17:27:30 2015 UTC,"No. I found this, which shows that Uverse has Fiber to the node. Businesses can get Fiber connections, but I have not found any residential."

Birmingham,30y2q7,AlverezYari,10,Tue Mar 31 17:45:22 2015 UTC,"U-Verse is only fiber to the curb, its copper to the houses. FYI."
Birmingham,30y2q7,AUChris03,3,Tue Mar 31 18:32:16 2015 UTC,"This is correct and is what is so time consuming about running the infrastructure for Gigapower (att's fiber gig internet) and Google Fiber. Yeah they have fiber to the curb (or node) but then they have to run fiber to every single house to support those speeds. And then take into account that not everyone will sign up for uverse/google fiber, they have to weigh their investment in the neighborhood."
Birmingham,30y2q7,mindshadow,2,Tue Mar 31 18:55:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know that. There are a few FTTP subdivisions from when U-Verse first started (new subdivisions were built with FTTP), but they don't do that anymore.

Birmingham,30y2q7,mixduptransistor,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"BellSouth used to run FTTP way back a long time ago before they were even bought by AT&T. Most FTTP that existed before ""Gigapower"" is that FTTP, called fiber in the loop ADSL. It's actually worse than regular DSL because it uses old technology that isn't manufactured anymore, and can't be upgraded."
Birmingham,30y2q7,mindshadow,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I never said it was good, just that it existed. :) I mean, AT&T makes some questionable design choices. Their 45Mbps service is dual-honed, no joke."
Birmingham,30y2q7,mixduptransistor,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:49:31 2015 UTC,"It really sucks for those folks, and it's ironic because it's usually in higher income neighborhoods. With just a little investment, AT&T could take out the old, outdated electronics and reuse the fiber for real U-Verse.   And I assume you mean the 45mbps service is two DSL lines bonded? Yeah, AT&T doing the ""fiber to the node"" thing instead of Verizon FiOS style FTTP was a strategic mistake. If your ""node"" is further than 100 meters away, then you're pretty much stuck with what you got. And with their focus on Gigapower, I doubt they will ever upgrade copper customers to faster DSL like G.fast or the other 100+mbps DSL services that the Europeans keep coming up with (but, again, distance is a huge problem for AT&T)"
Birmingham,30y2q7,mindshadow,2,Wed Apr 1 14:01:57 2015 UTC,"If your ""node"" is further than 100 meters away, then you're pretty much stuck with what you got.   Depends. Supposedly the new K cards that go in the VRAD can handle longer distances. I'm like 700 feet from the VRAD though so my signal to noise ratio is squeaky clean. Still a horrible design choice on AT&T's part though."
Birmingham,30y2q7,mixduptransistor,2,Wed Apr 1 14:07:38 2015 UTC,"That's not a U-Verse connection.  U-Verse is not fiber, and the fiber that UAB or any other business buys is from commercial ISPs like Earthlink, tw telecom, Level 3, or such as in the case of UAB, Qwest."

Instead of walking all over UAB dragging a handful of flyers behine me, I'd go to a few of the upper end salons in town. People are in those paying gobs of cash to get pretty.   Who wants their pic taken when they're pretty? Offer to take a few shots, send them a copy and everyone will be talking about that photog who sent them their pics.

Birmingham,30yuct,dyslexda,4,Tue Mar 31 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"Well they're obviously not essential, as evidenced by all the schools that don't have them. My issue here is that UAB had no say in the decisions made and that we've got administration who won't think twice about lying to students, faculty, athletes, and the general public from their position at a public institution. Still remains that a significant portion of students do want those activities as part of the full college experience."

Personally, I do my banking with a small, local credit union. I'm in my mid-30's, but thanks to my mom I've had an open account since I was in my early teens (like 13-14). I've never had a major problem with getting an auto loan, though I've had no use for a home loan. Nonetheless, my recommendation is to definitely seek out local credit unions first. Some one the ones that come to mind that don't have too many restrictions are:  America's First Federal Credit Union - They've been around forever, and one of my employers did our retirement accounts with them. Never had a problem. https://www.amfirst.org/membership/how-to-join/  Avadian (formerly Alabama Telco) - Much like America's First, they've been around for a good while and have a decent reputation. I know some friends who bank with them, with car and home loans and don't have any problems. https://www.avadiancu.com/forms/application/  Legacy Community Federal Credit Union - years ago I believe this was named University Federal Credit Union and was private to UAB employees. They are relatively open to public enrollment now.  https://www.legacycreditunion.com/membership.php  I was also going to include eCO Credit Union - http://www.ecocu.org/asp/home.asp - because I thought they had opened up their membership, also. But it seems like you still need to be an educator of some sort.  If you end up having to go with a traditional bank, honestly, I've always heard decent things about Regions. But your mileage may vary."

Which is fine for what it is. But serving premium meats with table service is a whole other ball game. And to see how hard it is to make that happen you only need to look at the now closed Metro Prime. The B&B people seem to be still trying to find their menu identity.

As for those that have posted negative things about this place, I hate to hear it. I have been several times and it remains among my favorite places in the Uptown area. The staff is friendly and eager to please and the food is good.  I feel like they are pretty honest about who they are and what they do.   Maybe I am too willing to overlook things, but a place that processes their own proteins on site, actually has classes for those that are interested in this (I have taken one and even though I knew what we  were being taught, the instructor - Thyme - was entertaining and knew his stuff) and serves good beer is alright with me."

Birmingham,30t983,FalconHunter,6,Mon Mar 30 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"I've been to B&B probably 6 or 7 times now. The food is excellent AND reasonably priced. My total bill is generally around $10 (and sometimes less). That is a bargain for the quality of the food.   That being said, the atmosphere is pretty awful and the location does not fit the business. I only order to-go, as I have no desire to eat in the actual restaurant. It's cold and just not very inviting. And, given that this is a butcher, it needs to be in a neighborhood. Convention-goers probably don't buy many pounds of raw hamburger meat...people living in nearby houses with grills probably do."

The world's not going to end because we like different things, but it just seems like you're actively campaigning against them, and you haven't even been to the place yourself. That's like giving a review of a movie you've never seen.   I don't think Uptown is a fiasco. It's not a place I enjoy visiting, but I'm not their target demographic either. I've always seen it as a place for out-of-towners who want to visit Birmingham and want to eat ""downtown,"" but still need something familiar with safe options. It's for tourists.   Why do you think it's a fiasco?"
Birmingham,30t983,vulcans_pants,-1,Tue Mar 31 14:56:47 2015 UTC,"Fiasco: cost. Todd English, for example, has elevated pricing for incredibly sub-par food. Their drink prices are equally elevated. Partly, it's because they're part of the hotel (it's printed on the Todd English receipt.) Partly, it's due to the area and the intent. They're basically just hotel restaurants all gathered in a little area that have little to know representation of Birmingham."
Birmingham,30t983,FalconHunter,2,Tue Mar 31 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"Being too expensive is hardly a fiasco.   Your complaint about the restaurants not being representative of Birmingham is all the more reason to support B&B as it's the only local restaurant at Uptown (not to mention that it's reasonably priced, especially when compared to the other places)."
Birmingham,30t983,vulcans_pants,-1,Tue Mar 31 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"I chose to disagree, just as I choose not to patronize the establishment. I don't expect anyone else to follow suit, I carry no more clout than anyone else.   If they share similar preferences, I'd imagine reading my commentary may save a person or three from wasting their time, money, and whatnot on a lackluster experience."
Birmingham,30t983,FalconHunter,2,Tue Mar 31 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"Sure, no reasonable person cares if you go and/or like the restaurant.   But, you've never been there. You don't know if it's a lackluster experience or not.   To review a place and to warn people against applying for a job when you have no firsthand experience with the establishment, well, that's not cool."
Birmingham,30t983,vulcans_pants,-1,Tue Mar 31 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"Do you trust your close friends and family who have shared tastes? Do you tend to agree with those close to you about specific things like dining experiences? Do you tend to share the same opinions with those people and trust their opinions in return?   I've been by there, so I have at least an outsider's experience with the venue. Additionally, do I really need to torture myself when multiple people I share opinions with all say the same thing?   I do not.   But, hey. If you wanna go and you think it's worth all of the hype and bluster, go for it.   Me? I'll continue to share my negative opinion of the venue with no desire to confirm it via my own torture. I'll happily spend money and time and any of the other myriad of venues throughout town."
Birmingham,30t983,FalconHunter,3,Tue Mar 31 22:56:29 2015 UTC,Trusting you circle of friends and family isn't the issue. It's the manner in which you shared their opinions on a public forum where it could have a real impact on a business's future.
Birmingham,30t983,vulcans_pants,2,Wed Apr 1 02:54:15 2015 UTC,"Do you have any personal experience with this place or have you only ""heard feedback?""

Birmingham,30t983,willco17,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:36:09 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your skepticism. Allow me to help.  I've patronized several of the Uptown restaurants so far and have been underwhelmed by each. Bottle & Bone was on that list until approximately a dozen (maybe more) friends with similar if not identical tastes and preferences for restaurants tried B&B before me and reported back. Of all the friends with similar tastes as mine, not one of those dozen had anything positive to say about it.   Now, you can attempt to pick me apart further by asking me what my tastes are and what I enjoy, but it's just another fight waiting to happen. You could ask me to cite what I consider good, and when I provide a list of examples, you can very well just counter-point me if you don't like that venue for whatever reason. (Be it Highlands, Bottega, Chez Lulu, Saw's, Surin, Miss Myra's, Nikki's West, whatever.)   At the end of the day, at least a dozen people of varying backgrounds and demographics all had a negative experience at B&B and recommended to me that I not waste my time. The last time I experienced such a fiasco was with Copper Grill or McCormick & Schmick's. In both of those cases, I didn't have to waste my money or time patronizing the establishments, my friends did and warned me away from making the same mistake as them. And what do you know? Both closed.   I'd love to be wrong. So I'll let them work out all of the kinks over the next year or so. If they're still there, I'll give it a shot."

We always wanted to add a steak dinner menu, but I believe in doing a minimally viable product until you have market feedback. We are going to do it in our style with what we're working with (that cavernous, industrial space and our beat-up kitchen equipment). So, we're going to make it pretty casual and interactive, and charge about half what big plush places charge for the same hand-cut prime steaks. Finally, I totally do hype stuff because I'm one person and have no ad budget, so thanks for noticing! ;)"

The vast majority of our customers are local, not tourists. 85,000 people work in the neighborhood.   I'm not comfortable with those numbers. It's all about time, place, clientele, and sustainability.   You've been open less than 1 year. You could go either way. Though if you don't last, I hope it's not a financially damaging loss or perhaps you can relocate and maintain the business. If you do succeed? Then I'm wrong and that's that.   If the vast majority of your customers are local, then I worry that you're a fad; that Uptown is a fad. Even Todd English is barren these days compared to same time last year. Not to mention service today at that venue is a disaster compared to 1 year ago. Cantina Laredo? Understandably popular at the moment, but it doesn't seem like a place I'm likely to go back to. I've enjoyed better from other, less costly venues. (Not a cheapskate, I just didn't feel I got what I paid for.)   While 85,000 people may work in your neighborhood, are you familiar with the demographics of those workers? While you have the executive and whatnot clientele from the law offices, banks, Southern Company, and elected officials, you also have a larger volume of grunts.   I don't know. Based on the 15 years I put in serving everything from 5-star to mom & pop TexMex, it just feels like it's out of place, or something I can't place a finger on. As an average consumer, I just have no desire to return to Uptown in the future. I'm not alone. In my close social circle (about 20 of us) we all drew the same conclusion independently. We're all part of that 25-49 demo with degrees, working in a professional field, and we like to enjoy the hidden local treasures. (I won't be so crass as to name drop the venues that appeal to us, but I'm certain they're some of your favorites as well.) And B&B just didn't match up to that for them, which told me that I wasn't going to like it. After many years of being stubborn and doing it anyway, I learned my lesson and who I had common tastes with.   With regards to hype, I was more referring to the public, not so much yourself. It's not like you're spamming reddit with ads, so that didn't draw my ire.  I hope you and your staff are able to fully realize your potential and more, but I'm not encouraging servers to apply and I probably won't be patronizing your venue."
Birmingham,30t983,Landowns,2,Wed Apr 1 19:53:26 2015 UTC,$4/hour? I can only aspire to such awesome wages.
Birmingham,30t983,FalconHunter,3,Mon Mar 30 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"The idea is that tips cover the rest, but Bottle & Bone isn't exactly catering to the kind of clientele that would make putting in the effort worth it."
Birmingham,30t983,Landowns,2,Mon Mar 30 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"I know, but it's a little weird to advertise the hourly wage for a server position, when, as every server knows, the hourly wage basically just offsets the taxes on your total income. If looking to maximize my wages, I'd be much more concerned with, as you said, the price of the food and the ""kind of clientele"" of the restaurant."
Birmingham,30t983,dreed18,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:19:08 2015 UTC,I hope your customers know to tip if you're paying such low wages.
Birmingham,30t983,FalconHunter,2,Mon Mar 30 18:37:22 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Bottle & Bone has been open for a bit of time already. Regulars aren't going to realize the change if the table service is new and tipping won't happen.  Then there's the clientele, which don't seem to be very tip-savvy."
Birmingham,30t983,jmwbama311,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:18:43 2015 UTC,"Regardless of your thoughts about this venture, this is a local business that's offering paying jobs yo our community, and should be welcomed."
Birmingham,30t983,FalconHunter,0,Tue Mar 31 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"$2.13-$4.00/hr is a paying job? With a commute to Uptown, where parking is already a fiasco?   Ehhhh....  If I was waiting tables again, that's the last place I'd look. YMMV."
