OP asked about making the stop go smoother, not how to avoid getting shot.  If someone starts narrating their every action before they do it, they come across as nervous and a little off.  Most people don't do that.  SO, if you're acting like a nervous weirdo I'm going to keep you for probably 5 or so minutes longer while I question you about where you're coming from, where you're headed, why you're nervous, what's in the car.

AskLEO,3dustz,engineered_academic,10,Sun Jul 19 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"Where I work, we have several things we can do if we're not able to communicate effectively with your wife. First of all, we'd get in contact with the Asian Liaison Unit, who would send out a Mandarin/Cantonese speaking officer if we have one working. In the meanwhile, we can use the Language Line, where we call a certified interpreter and he or she translates over speakerphone. This works especially well if we can't even figure out what language the person is speaking, and if they speak no English at all. If none of this works, the city has on-call civilian interpreters who can be called in, but this is a last resort because they cost so much."
AskLEO,3dustz,DistrictCop,7,Sun Jul 19 18:43:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not a LEO, but I am an interpreter - I work for a company that provides over the phone interpretation.  In the US, by law, organizations that receive federal moneys, such as police departments, must provide language access. Which is not to say that individual police officers will always avail themselves of the services of an over the phone interpreter or that they will deem them necessary, but it is a service that they should have available to them.  The officers I have interpreted for have always been respectful of the LEP (limited English proficient) individual's rights.    May I suggest that your wife carry something with her that names the language she speaks, not just Chinese, but more specifically, like  Mandarin, Cantonese or her dialect.  That way if the officer wants to get a telephonic interpreter, they will know what language to request.  My experience is that interpreters are used more when the person is at the police department, for example, when making if they make a police report or after arrest, or when doing investigation, rather than when out in on the road, like at a traffic stop.    You can look up some more information on this at lep.gov."

AskLEO,3dqvf7,lurkattwork,17,Sat Jul 18 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"""The US"" is a big place, the outcome will depend on a lot more than what you've given us. That said... your friend doesn't have cartel connections, not if he's only got 8 Oz on him, depending on you for a ride, associates with people who only make $7200 a year (and owns a car, coughbullshitcough). People with cartel connections don't use them to extort $600 from people. What you have is a junkie or a meth addict for a ""friend"" who has found some gullible chump into being his patsy. Sucks for you, I hope you find a way to get out of that scene - because it sounds like you're probably more into it than you realize. Are you smoking meth, doing pills, or any form of heroin? Of course you claimed ignorance of the marijuana in your car - but here's the thing. If it was good pot, it's $200/oz or so, and $1600 is nothing to real dealers, let alone a cartel. If it was cheap pot, like Mexican brick weed, it's $20 an oz these days, maybe less, and it basically just pot flavored dirt...it wasn't even worth $200. The Mexican cartels lose 10,000x that a day and don't bat an eye...       Now, to answer your question, yes, you can be compelled to testify, but you cannot be compelled to tell them anything that you don't know. And it would have to go to trial anyways. And chances are, they don't need you. He got busted, that he was in possession isn't in question, and it doesn't matter where he was coming from or going to. The fact that he is extorting money from you and coercing you to not testify and demanding money from you, THAT is a much more serious crime than simple possession of a small amount of marijuana (it may seem significant to some, but it's really no that much). If the prosecutor founds out he's tampering with a witness, that's a serious charge."

AskLEO,3dj78i,GreeleyBornAndRaised,165,Thu Jul 16 18:28:18 2015 UTC,"Who are people you interact with frequently?   I could name 10 or 12.    One guy, let's call him ""Pete.""  Pete is an alcoholic.  Pete walks the streets at night, begging enough money to buy a pint of cheap vodka.  Sometimes Pete works with other homeless and boozers to coordinate working certain corners.  He'll hold a sign that says ""Homeless veteran, anything helps, god bless!""  He's not a veteran.  Once he's got enough money, he gets drunk.  Once he gets drunk, he stumbles into traffic, starts fights...something to get our attention.  The thing that sets Pete apart from the many other folks like him that I deal with is...Pete is always soaked head to toe in urine.  Every time I've dealt with him.  Literally dripping with urine.  Like...several peoples urine amount of urine.  And he always wants to fight.  I keep a spare uniform in my locker just for encounters with Pete.  Then there's Jerry.  Jerry rolls around town in a wheelchair.  Jerry can't speak - he's got a tracheotomy.  Jerry's Hepatitis and HIV positive.  Jerry looks like a frail, old, paraplegic black man.  Jerry can walk just fine (and run, too.)  Jerry likes to weave in and out of traffic in his wheelchair, causing accidents.  When an officer tries to push Jerry out of the road, Jerry will often try to stab the officer with one of the feces-smeared knives he sits on.  So, those of us that know, don't give him the chance, and if he doesn't comply with verbal commands, we knock him out of the wheelchair and cuff him before he has a chance to stab us with his poop knives.  I'm sure that's made for quite a spectacle; ""Did you see that!?  Those cops knocked that poor old black man out of his wheelchair for nothing!""  Teddy holds a record for being arrested more times than any other person on the planet.  He was even on talk shows for it.  Teddy is pretty much harmless.  He puts on a fancy suit, goes out on the town, gets super drunk, and finds an officer to take him to jail.  He'll do whatever he needs to get us to take him in.  He'll walk up to me and say, ""Take me home.""  I'll say ""Not tonight Teddy, I'm too busy,"" and then he'll whip his penis out and shake it at the nearest bystander.    Speaking of penises, that gets me to Ron.  Ron is...gifted, and he likes to show off.  Ron likes to wear women's clothing, inside out, for some reason, and likes showing his impressive manhood to anyone with two eyes.  Ron always runs, and he's fast.  Dan doesn't have any legs.  Or anything below the bellybutton, really.  I've heard he tried to commit suicide by laying on train tracks, and didn't die.  Basically all there is below his bellybutton is a...colostomy port?  I forget what they call it.  Basically it's an exit for his bowels.  Anyway, Dan has an electric wheelchair but he's always losing it.  He's pretty quick on his hands though.  He's a menace.  Usually he'll get super drunk, end up in a hospital, and try to steal stuff.  When we show up, he wants to fight, and he likes to try to get you in the face with his colostomy thing.  He's pretty spry for being half a fellow.   Do enjoy working with some of them regularly?   Nope"

When I did probation there was a 17 year old kid, we will call him Michael, who I commonly came across for everything. He was a gangster and was always finding his way to jail, but since he was a minor he was always out. As his career was taking off, it was exactly in line with my career. While I was dealing with thefts, vandalism, and other community issues, Michael was out there committing thefts, vandalism, and wreaking havoc on the community. Towards the end of my probation there was a shooting in the projects where a ""Bounty Hunter"" gang member was walking through the projects and gun down in broad day light right next to the baseball field. As the projects are recorded via CCTV, the gunman was masked of course and looked like every other gangster who lived there. Except while reviewing the tape there were two familiar figures walking right behind the victim. A few minutes prior you see our boy Michael, take out his phone and makes a call to someone. A few minutes later our bounty hunter was dead. We forwarded this info to Homicide detectives who brought our boy Michael in for questioning, grabbed a warrant for the phone, a call was made to the killer.

Something was off though, enough for us to notice and comment on it. But, he had people around him, we assumed it was just the daily grind for them. When I passed him again several hours later though, it was definitely different. He was alone, and that distinct difference between ""crumpled up, passed out"" and ""twisted up like a dead sack of fat, skin, and bones"" was there. I'm 95% sure he was dead. Being a smaller girl and alone, I didn't stop. Called it in, heard on the scanner the paramedics dub him an ""85 Delta - Possible Fatality"" when they pulled up on the scene. I guess I'm just curious. I can't think of one single way I'd be able to follow up on him. Maybe I should have called it in sooner?

I would assume you are not complaining about theft of these products, so I assume you do keep them out of public reach. I would add that you could remove visibility to the product, and make buying them inconvenient. It would only be the addict with a time-sensitive demand for the product. Perhaps concoct a need to pre-order them, or wait a little bit?  Your customers will not answer you honestly. You'd be wasting your time. Perhaps play on their general paranoia of LEO - make small talk about those dang cops who keep coming in asking about meth addicts, without ever implying, at all, their participation in that demographic.

I'm seeing stuff on this site that suggests that it's:     Illegal for anyone under 21 in NC to purchase or own a handgun. It should stay in your fathers name until you're 21. If you're under 18, you cannot even posses it without the legal owner present. It is illegal for someone to purchase then subsequently transfer a gun to an ineligible person so as to by-pass applicable laws (so you father buying you hand gun because you cannot legally do so yourself, is quite possibly a felony offense)   Also, it looks like open carry follows the same restrictions as concealed, minus the permit - which says you have to be 21.    Your statement that your parents bought it for you as a gift is ... iffy... they bought it, and let you use it - if they bought it for you, they likely did so illegally (I am not a lawyer).   I know the whole open carry thing is a popular ""protest"" but I would urge you to just hold off on the whole thing. Without getting all political about it, just... don't. By all means, practice shooting, learn how to use your gun, learn the proper safety, and be well informed of what your rights are - but don't engage with the whole culture of confrontational gun politics, it's just asinine.   FWIW, I own many guns, am a firm supporter of the second amendment (and also of rational gun laws).

I live in New Mexico where we have pretty liberal gun laws (liberal meaning permissive) and have been shooting since I was about 5 or 6. I fully support what you're doing, and hope you have a great experience! Obviously state laws vary, but I'm pretty sure you can legally carry your gun on private property or a shooting range you're using. Of course, when at a shooting range, or anywhere, safety is #1, and you should generally have your weapon cased when transporting it from your car to your shooting position (bench, stall, berm, table, etc), and when in use, but not actively being fired it should be made safe (in the case of a pistol that means magazine out, slide back, ideally with a chamber indicator device in place). The range I belong to forbids loaded and holstered carry outside sanctioned events or live training, and only when in designated areas, i.e. You can't just walk around the range being social with a loaded and holstered weapon.

Depending on the county they're usually processed in 1-14 days.  Any handgun recipient in NC (with the exception of inheritance I believe) needs to have a pistol purchase permit or a concealed handgun permit in order to be transferred a handgun - regardless of whether you purchased it or received it as a gift or won it in a contest or whatever.  There is no handgun registration in NC, so it's not registered in your Dad's name. There's no process for registering it, and you don't even have to own a handgun to open carry it so you're fine there.

""Cop"" as a slang term meaning ""to catch, snatch or grab"" appeared in English in the 18th century, ironically originally used among thieves -- a ""copper"" was a street thief. But by the middle of the 19th century, criminals apprehended by the police were said to have themselves been ""copped"" -- caught -- by the ""coppers"" or ""cops."" Some say it was the brass/copper buttons they wore.   and then this   Cockney rhyming slang London police force was founded by John Peal so a policeman in the east end of London was The. Old Bill made up of a unit of 12 men who were payed a shilling a day a shilling is made up of 12 pennies Pennies were made of copper and are known as coppers. A shilling was known as. a Bob all London policeman are known as Bobbies and as coppers so the Irish. took it to New York   but near the bottom this explanatation is listed, and I think it is the most accurate (plus references)  Cop:   ""policeman,"" 1859, abbreviation of earlier copper (1846), from the verb.   http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term...   The most commonly-heard theories trace ""cop"" (or ""copper"") meaning ""police officer"" to copper buttons worn on early police uniforms, or to copper police badges supposedly issued in some cities, but there is no real evidence for any of this. Still other theories explain ""cop"" as an acronym, standing for ""Constable On Patrol,"" ""Chief of Police"" or other such phrases. But these ""acronym"" theories bear all the hallmarks of being spurious after-the-fact stories invented to explain ""cop."" Among other sticky details is the fact that acronyms were virtually unknown in English before the 20th century, while ""cop"" itself was well-established by the mid-19th century.   The secret of ""cop"" probably lies in the fact that before it was a noun it was a verb. The verb ""to cop,"" meaning ""to capture"" or ""lay hold of"" first appeared in English around 1704, later coming to mean ""to take"" or ""to steal,"" a sense that is still in use today (as in ""cop a plea""). This ""cop"" may have come from the Dutch ""capen"" (to steal) or from the Scottish ""cap,"" both ultimately from the Latin word ""capere,"" meaning ""to seize,"" which also gave us ""capture."" ""Cop"" as a slang term meaning ""to catch, snatch or grab"" originally was used among thieves, and a ""copper"" was a street thief. But sometime in the early 19th century, irony kicked in the door, and criminals apprehended by the police were said to have themselves been ""copped"" -- caught -- by the ""coppers"" or ""cops.""   http://www.word-detective.com/091400.htm...   Half a dozen explanations at least have been put forward for this one, including an acronym from “constable on patrol”, which is reminiscent of the story behind posh and quite certainly just as spurious. It is also said to come from the copper badges carried by New York City’s first police sergeants (patrolmen were alleged to have had brass ones and senior officers silver); it is almost as often said to refer to the supposedly copper buttons of the first London police force of the 1820s. Both these stories seem about equally unlikely.   The most probable explanation is that it comes from the slang verb cop, meaning “to seize”, originally a dialect term of northern England which by the beginning of the nineteenth century was known throughout the country. This can be followed back through the French caper to the Latin capere, “to seize, take”, from which we also get our capture.   The situation is complicated because there are — or have been — a number of other slang meanings for cop, including “to give somebody a blow”, and the phrase cop out, as an escape or retreat. Both of these may come from the Latin capere. But it’s suggested that another sense of cop, “to steal”, could come from the Dutch kapen, “to take or steal”. There’s also “to beware, take care”, an Anglo-Indian term from the Portuguese coprador, and phrases like “you’ll cop it!” (“you’ll be punished, you’ll get into trouble”), which could come from the idea of seizing or catching, but may be a variant of catch.   http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cop2..."

AskLEO,3ctc0r,PattyOFurniture91,8,Fri Jul 10 16:40:53 2015 UTC,"It looks like, according to Connecticut law, unless the patient caused serious physical injury to another, all of the applicable offenses would be misdemeanors or lower, including ""Assault in the 3rd Degree,"" ""Creating a Public Disturbance,"" and ""Breach of the Peace in the 2nd Degree.""  Those are what I found just from skimming Connecticut penal code.  The next question would concern police arrest authority in Connecticut.  For the most part, nationwide, law enforcement officers can arrest without warrant any person whom they have probable cause to believe has committed a felony (Connecticut uses the term reasonable grounds instead of probable cause.)  Where states tend to vary is in arrest authority for misdemeanor or lower offenses.  Some states will only allow police officers to arrest, without warrant, persons whom they personally witnessed committing a misdemeanor offense.  Other misdemeanor offenses may not be arrestable at all, and yet others may require arrest.  For example, in my state, we can only arrest for certain misdemeanors (even if we directly witness the crime.)  We can arrest for shoplifting, but not theft.  We can arrest for trespassing on property, but not trespassing in a home.  We have discretion whether to arrest for DUI of a motor vehicle, but have no discretion and must arrest for DUI of a non-motor vehicle (i.e. a bicycle, a horse.)  Silly, I know.  The most often used assault statute in my state is Assault 4th Degree, which is a misdemeanor.  I may not arrest for that crime unless I directly witness it, or can articulate that if I don't arrest, the perpetrator will continue to be a danger to the public or himself.  However, my state recently amended that statute to allow me to arrest for Assault 4th Degree if the crime occurs on hospital grounds...just based on probable cause.  Meaning, if nurses are bruised up, and have injuries consistent with witness statements, or surveillance footage is present...enough to meet the standards of probable cause, I may arrest for it.    Prior to that change, the victims would have to, themselves, fill out a criminal complaint form at the County Attorney's office, bringing charges against the perpetrator.  My only role was taking statements from both sides and completing a criminal incident report.    Were I you, I'd ask a police officer in your jurisdiction.  He/She will be able to tell you what elements must be met in order for them to arrest or issue citations for offenses in your hospital, and perhaps how better to document these incidents and preserve evidence."

I was told by an officer that I could hit them to make them stop because ""that's the only way they'll understand"". I am only a security guard and have taken the test to get licensed as one. I know about the use of force continuum, and with the patient already in 4 points I feel like someone may consider that punching a restrained patient an excessive use of force.

I get spit on, punched at, kicked at, etc and we have little form of protection.  OP, as far as the abuse from patients goes, if they're psychologically disturbed and they're already admitted to the hospital or in the ED, the cops usually don't arrest. The psychiatrist can order a 51/50 hold and they will remain in the hospital until they are medically cleared. If for some reason the cops arrests them, they will too order a 51/50 hold and they'll stay in the hospital until they are medically cleared to go to another more appropriate psych facility or elsewhere.   Unless the patient knows what they're doing and are mentally stable, then they are usually arrested and sent to jail if medically cleared. I've seen both situations happen where I work.  One time a drunk started hitting one of the nurses and then started using anything as a weapon. I feared for his roommate (the drunk guy was standing in the doorway to his room). We had to barricade ourselves and the other patients from him with our medication carts, chairs, etc. But his roommate was still in his room. It was a one floor facility so I removed the screen from the outside window and attempted to get the guy out (we had no security at this place). While I was helping him out the window, the drunk guy used a makeshift shank (fork with two prongs bent back) and stabbed me in my flank). I'm a small woman, but luckily it didn't do more than puncture the skin.   Cops got there and he continued his violent rage and it took them 30 minutes to subdue him. They finally got ahold of him and I gave him a sleepy time cocktail injection in his butt. They ended up taking him to jail. I didn't press charges or anything as I knew this guy was drunk and had a form of dementia (Wernicke's Korsakoff's syndrome caused by long-term alcoholism).  Sorry so long, but I get this a lot and we do our best to defend ourselves and the patients while trying to deescalate the situation. We can use restraints and meds with a doctor's order, but of course that can take a few minutes. In those minutes, a lot can happen so we try to get as many people as possible to hold them down when necessary. We're not allowed to hit or punch, but we can restrain and hold them down.

Even I would likely lose my job over that.  Look, your job...kinda sucks.  Hospitals such as yours have become the dumping grounds for people that politicians would rather forget about.  My state did away with the more traditional model of mental healthcare...meaning no more padded rooms or straight jackets...because the politicians got more votes saying that a more ""progressive"" model of mental healthcare based on ""integration"" would work.  Well, it doesn't.  For some people, there just isn't yet a solution, and they simply cannot function in the general population.

AskLEO,3cmcam,lurkattwork,5,Thu Jul 9 09:22:16 2015 UTC,"No, I am a real, sworn LEO, verified here.  And I love your use of the caps there.... Just because it is stalking does not mean that his source of information is illegal, and that was what is in question.  Further, stalking usually includes ""obsessive"" attention, and in this case it seems to be stemming from one occasion.  Not all states would consider this stalking.  Now it does not state that he made any threat, nor attempted to contact her or interact with her at all.  The vehicle that he photographed was in public view and not in a place where she has a reasonable expectation of privacy, so no crime broken there.  The information could have been looked up from open source internet, so possibly no crime there either.  Now since you use such definitive statements, and seem to be convinced that this is illegal and dangerous why don't you go ahead and write up some allegations against him and present these to get you either;  One, a charge against him for stalking based on the state he is in.  Two, articulatable fear of imminent harm or danger to get a PPO.  Or maybe you can just not talk about shit when you don't understand anything involved.  Either way, have a nice day kiddo.  And just for your reference: Cal Civ Code § 1708.7 (2014) Stalking    (1) The defendant engaged in a pattern of conduct the intent of which was to follow, alarm, or harass the plaintiff. In order to establish this element, the plaintiff shall be required to support his or her allegations with independent corroborating evidence.   No pattern there is there...."

I had to go back to see if you did ALL CAPS as well and only saw the LEO part so figured he made a mistake.   But yeah I agree, he drove by once? That's not stalking in any state. Has to be prolonged, obsessive, abusive and a few other items that's have to checked off. He did it once, that's not stalking, that's just creepy.   And we all know creepy isn't illegal. Well, LEO's know it's not, non-LEO's think creepy is illegal. Which is why they're not LEO's, they'd be really bad at it."

Of course, Police have far greater access to records than the public do, but there are strict rules against looking up anyone not directly related to your work. Looking up a son in law is a sackable offence.   My department has an automated access audit system by flagging certain persons, that will trigger a please explain if you look them up. The flags are set against celebrity, sports and persons involved in high profile incidents. Personal flags are set for your immediate family and anyone recorded as their associates.    If you trip one of the flags, you are required to account for your reason to look them up. It's normally not a big deal, but I hear at least once a year of somebody who was terminated for improper access.   In addition to that, there are random audits, where names from your search history are pulled and you are required to account for that also.

SO this is normal for you? Even with the cost of private services would you make the effort to investigate the man dating your (hypothetical) daughter?   Of course, Police have far greater access to records than the public do, but there are strict rules against looking up anyone not directly related to your work.    I have learned this is indeed the standard operation from other comments in this thread.   My department has an automated access audit system by flagging certain persons, that will trigger a please explain if you look them up. The flags are set against celebrity, sports and persons involved in high profile incidents. Personal flags are set for your immediate family and anyone recorded as their associates. If you trip one of the flags, you are required to account for your reason to look them up. It's normally not a big deal, but I hear at least once a year of somebody who was terminated for improper access.   In a previous comment I inquired about a friend of my FIL that has contacts in his old department. He is able to get case files, names, plates, and other information not available to the public. How does this fit into the checks and balances of your system? Is that type of access even possible in your PD?   If I did learn that he was found with some tabs of acid 14 years ago, but nothing since, I'd have no problem with that. He learns, after all.   This is encouraging. I've always suspected he knew but does not care. However from other's input here I am seriously considering telling him before someone else does.   Not in the slightest. I know my team would give me shit about it, but that's what they do. If not for that, it would be for having greys in my beard, or thinning on top, or something else.   So in Australia there isn't any regulations when it comes to ""Associating With Known Criminals"" for actice members of the local PD?"

That said, he still wishes I'd married my ex, a great guy, even though my ex has been charged twice now with minor marijuana possession. This is the same man who I thought would disown me for suspecting I'd tried smoking pot once in HS.

With the current climate, its not all free and clear anymore to just look people up like it used to be. In almost all cases that stuff is monitored and logged (as it should be).  That said, heres what i would do.  Take the guy out golfing or fishing or something he likes to do. Dont do it right at first and make shit awkward but make sure its gets done.

Frankly some places do have policies about associating with know felons, but if hes aware then he knows how to tow the line (ie: cant leave you at home alone etc).

They courts have also held that you need to have an intent to commit this crime, but only a general one. You don't need to be specifically showing yourself to one person or people in particular, only knowingly exposing yourself to public view.   In Selph v. District of Columbia, they held that ""ordinary acts involving exposure as a result of carelessness or thoughtlessness, particularly when such acts take place within the privacy of one's home, do not in themselves establish the act of indecent exposure.""

AskLEO,3bp70j,GlenOnReddit,2,Wed Jul 1 16:09:22 2015 UTC,I like the idea of being told why I am getting hand cuffed.   You do have to be told why you're being arrested but nobody's talking about arrest here. This is about  duty to state name and addresses.  Edit: added link to English case that established duty to be informed of reasons for arrest.

AskLEO,3bn389,FlyTrap50,9,Tue Jun 30 15:54:08 2015 UTC,"I was a detective and I got assigned an assault case.  The story was a little hokey (both parties were drunk and had injuries) and there were no witnesses or independent evidence one way or the other.  I figured I would talk to the ""suspect"" and he would tell me a different version of events and I would end up with a ""he said she said"" scenario.   With two differing versions of events I wouldn't be able to determine the primary aggressor and I would have to suspend the case.  The only problem was the other party wouldn't talk to me about it.  I kept telling him that I needed to get his side of the story or else the only information I would be able to go on was the other party's version.  This guy had seen too many youtube videos or something and refused to cooperate at all.  I ended up getting an assault warrant on him since I only had statements from one side."
AskLEO,3bn389,biohazardforlunch,7,Tue Jun 30 20:07:06 2015 UTC,"There are three options.  1.) The entire contact was voluntary, and they choose not to talk and they (or I) leave and both of us go about our day.  2.) I have probable cause to arrest.  They don't talk and I put them in handcuffs and drive them to the station.  3.) I have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity but not enough to arrest.  They get detained at the scene while I continue my investigation.  Sometimes, their refusal to talk extends the time it takes me to do this."
AskLEO,3bn389,Citicop,5,Tue Jun 30 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"Not very often, you can usually get enough of a connection with someone that they'll want to tell their version of events. Generally if I actually want to talk to someone and they refuse, they're only hurting themselves. People that I arrest for anything more serious than a misdemeanor I don't even talk to, that's the investigator's job. And for misdemeanor domestic assault suspects, I honestly prefer when they ask for an attorney or whatever, that ends the statement immediately and I can take them to jail, write my report, and move on to the next call."
AskLEO,3bn389,whirlinggibberish,7,Tue Jun 30 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"Sometimes. I encounter people who don't want to speak to me regardless of the circumstances I find them. Unless they are guilty and did something heinous they are probably better off talking to me then i can eliminate them from the suspect list of whatever i am investigating. Contrary to popular belief (on the internet), police don't like to arrest/charge innocent people. If you can eliminate yourself from the suspect pool you are saving yourself a bunch of lawyer fees and time. Also depending on the seriousness of the crime, and you did do something wrong, if you talk to me and are honest, usually I can work something out with the victim where charges won't be brought (like you cleaning up some grafitti, or paying for the gas and dash).  When police say they want to hear your side of the story they mean it. I can't count the amount of times where if the person would've just talked to me in the first place, the other person involved would've been charged and not them or no charges at all. We can only work with what people tell us because a lot of the time there is next to no physical evidence."

I cannot speak how it is in the USA, but i have a hard time believing that it is so wildly different than your neighbours to the north that a police force would put people in jail without informing them ofnwhy they are there. Come trial day the accused gets full disclosure of the case against them. They may not understand why they have been charged ie. Passenger in stolen vehicle getting charged with possession of stolen property ""but i wasn't driving"" but they will know what they are being charged with. 3 months in jail with out so much as knowin the details of why they are there i call bullshit."

AskLEO,3bgj3g,BrassyJack,-1,Mon Jun 29 14:55:27 2015 UTC,"Your understanding of search and seizure is shockingly lacking. The definition of curtilage is the area surrounding a house to which a reasonable expectation of privacy extends. No one with even a sliver of understanding of criminal procedure would make the claim that officers can go into any backyard, any time. In this case, there was even a fence surrounding the back yard, the primary factor used to determine curtilage.   Allow me to copypasta Wikipedia's quotation of Scalia regarding Florida v Jardines:  We therefore regard the area ""immediately surrounding and associated with the home""—what our cases call the curtilage—as ""part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes.""[46] ... That principle has ancient and durable roots. Just as the distinction between the home and the open fields is ""as old as the common law,""[47] ... so too is the identity of home and what Blackstone called the ""curtilage or homestall,"" for the ""house protects and privileges all its branches and appurtenants.""[48] ... This area around the home is ""intimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically,"" and is where ""privacy expectations are most heightened.""[49]  The Court acknowledged that a doorbell or knocker is typically treated as an invitation, or license, to the public to approach the front door of the home to deliver mail, sell goods, solicit for charities, etc. This license extends to the police, who have the right to try engaging a home's occupant in a ""knock and talk"" for the purpose of gathering evidence without a warrant. However:  This implicit license typically permits the visitor to approach the home by the front path, knock promptly, wait briefly to be received, and then (absent invitation to linger longer) leave. Complying with the terms of that traditional invitation does not require fine-grained legal knowledge; it is generally managed without incident by the Nation's Girl Scouts and trick-or-treaters.[50] - Wikipedia quoting Scalia  As for your claim that the officers could enter the home after being explicitly denied consent, that is the most clearly improper part of this whole scenario. You can search a person's house in the following cases: consent, warrant, exigency, and hot pursuit. Assuming OP's facts are accurate, which one of these requirements applies? Answer: not a damn one."

Also I am NOT required to tell you the specific law or section of said law under which you are being arrested. I merely have to tell you in plain English why you are under arrest (unless you don't speak any English of course but that's a different kettle of fish)."

AskLEO,3beeee,JeanNaimard_WouldSay,3,Sun Jun 28 16:02:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm I'm not actually sure if we have to comply with something like section 73 on there. I think the normal way of enforcing the name/address-giving would be to say ""if you don't provide me with your name, you'll be arrested for X offence"" anyway though so that satisfies it anyway.   I can't really see a situation where a person is both calm enough to be asked their name and has not committed a serious offence where I would need to jump straight to an arrest for failure to provide their name. It'd make both our lives so much easier if I just tell him that if he doesn't provide his name he'll be arrested for X offence to give him a chance to comply, arresting and booking into custody every scrote who daubs his name on a wall or breaks a window is not the aim of the game (which is NOT to say that it's not our aim to deal with it in other ways).

AskLEO,3beeee,hashtaters,0,Sun Jun 28 18:56:40 2015 UTC,"Not an LEO but I suspect that once the person is under arrest any discussion in regards to the incident could be considered interrogation. Without the reading of Miranda rights a good defense attorney could argue due process not being followed or something along those lines.   However, if he says ""you are arrested for crime X"" and then the ada sees other crimes that can be charged they will amend the case to include those charges as well."
AskLEO,3beeee,dclark87,2,Sun Jun 28 18:59:03 2015 UTC,Discussions and statements from LEO's do not require Miranda. Miranda is only required when a person is in custody and will be asked guilt seeking questions.

AskLEO,3beeee,ruminajaali,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:34:16 2015 UTC,What's custodial arrest?
AskLEO,3beeee,startingfresh1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"Custodial arrest is when they have PC that you have committed a crime and they put you under arrest (e.g., they've put cuffs on you and are pressing charges).  So, not when you're being detained (detained is still a form of arrest, but it's not custodial arrest).  The important part of what I said though is not the ""custodial arrest,"" because you already know what arrest is.  The important part is ""unless you're being questioned.""  If a cop arrests you for a felony he saw you commit, he may very well arrest you, cuff you, transport you, and chuck you in jail to wait for arraignment while he just fills out paperwork.  You can make it from arrest all the way to court without ever being read your rights, if the officer doesn't care to question you (and if you commit the crime in his presence and he sees it, or someone else is pressing charges and he performed an investigation that did not include talking to you, he may not bother talking to you).  Finally...reading rights may not look like what you think.  An officer could say   ""You are under arrest.  I want to talk to you as part of my investigation.  You do not have to answer my questions, but you may choose to do so if you wish.  Anything you say may be included in my report to the court.  You may also speak to an attorney, and the court will provide a public defender if you cannot afford to retain one privately.""  Something like that contains all of your Miranda rights, and it would count as being Mirandized.  Summary: they don't have to read you rights at all until they want to question you after an arrest, and they are not required to do so at all otherwise.  Also, Miranda is the communication of a set of rights - it does not necessarily go ""You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a blah blah blah.""  Some departments have Miranda that are as intentionally brief as possible and which are designed to not sound like a Miranda warning (aka, they use different language that doesn't sound familiar)."

You folks have some good policy talks from time to time, was just contributing to that.    If actual data shows marijuana intoxication is on par with your average OTC antihistamine, that seems like valuable information when it comes to prioritization of resourses.  Especially when most state BAC laws are still well above what qualifies as inebriation and shown to have a significant impact on public safety."
AskLEO,3akgxx,supple,2,Sun Jun 21 19:00:56 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, you are correct, in my mind I meant intoxicated, my mistake. To preface, I agree that alcohol is an overwhelming issue to driving accidents (a lot of issues actually...) for a variety of reasons.   Anyway, posting the link without context doesn't give any indication on the argument you mean to make, which is why I made the assumption that you meant one is ""more ok"" or ""safer"" or ""better"" to drive under than the other, rather than just comparison in and of itself. My assumption was based off my own experience that a majority of internet persons who have linked to similar (possibly the same) research are arguing that this data means it is ""ok"" to drive high. I feel the same about any kind of sedative/stimulant that fuzzes your state-of-mind. Hell, even being too tired is dangerous.  How do you compare doses and driving accidents? Is marijuana intoxication a lot or a little ingestion vs. a little or a lot for OTC antihistamines? The research paper linked in the article is not controlled by these things and seem to merely be finding correlations with specific substances being in persons after an accident has already occurred. They didn't always have ways to indicate when or how much of the drug was consumed within x-amount of time of the crash.   Yes this is a good step for the research in this area! But definitely not quite enough information to re-prioritize resources quite yet. At least, I don't know if it would be a strong enough argument yet.  Quote from the paper:    ""This is the first large-scale case control study in the United States to assess the crash risks associated with both drug and alcohol use by drivers. Findings from this study provide valuable insights concerning the current nature of the impaired driving problem. However, considering the complexity of the impaired driving issue, especially concerning use of drugs other than alcohol, and the challenges of obtaining relevant information on this topic, these findings should be viewed in the context of the established body of scientific evidence on the subject."""

AskLEO,3ajlax,JeanNaimard_WouldSay,5,Sat Jun 20 22:15:55 2015 UTC,Smoke and vapor are scientifically two different things.  Smoke is a colloidal suspension - a solid that is lighter than air.  Vapor is a gas.
AskLEO,3ajlax,FantasticRabbit,-6,Sun Jun 21 00:03:32 2015 UTC,"E-cigarette smoke is just as annoying as cigarette smoke.  Smokers, like any addicted people, seldom give any thought to other people, so relying on their goodwill to avoid annoying nearby people has, again and again, never been proven effective, so it was necessary to essentially ban smoking in any public places."
AskLEO,3ajlax,JeanNaimard_WouldSay,2,Sun Jun 21 03:17:36 2015 UTC,"On average, PEOPLE seldom give any thought to other people. I don't think it's strictly applicable to smokers or addicts."
AskLEO,3ajlax,JadedCop,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:26:20 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with smokers. Me and all my other friends who use e-cigs are always respectful in public and it's honestly embarrassing to use it openly in a restaurant or some other indoor public place.
AskLEO,3ajlax,abhpro,3,Mon Jun 29 03:27:59 2015 UTC,"they also spew out smoke, which is as annoying as tobacco.  they should be treated exactly like smoking in general.   Although vapour is not the same thing as smoke, I agree that it should be legally in the same class. The issue is informed consent.   The law holds the view that minors lack the capacity to make an informed choice about inhaling tobacco products, and they therefore lack the capacity to make an informed choice about vapour products.   The law has restricted places where people can smoke, becuase their choice to smoke is imposed on others due to the nature of those places, such as restaurants, public transport, hopsitals, etc.   Those same conditions affect vapour too. If you put vapour into the air in those places, your choice to use vapour is imposed on others without their consent."
AskLEO,3ajlax,GlenOnReddit,3,Sun Jun 21 03:25:09 2015 UTC,"The regulations on smoking are not because smoking is annoying. It is because it is known to be harmful to others. Vapor is also not smoke. Essentially vapor is made from propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin. It is the same concept as a fog machine. Difference is that they add flavor, and sometimes nicotine. The important thing to note is that it is believed to be not harmful, but there hasn't been enough research on it. Nicotine alone is not necessarily that bad for you, it is the smoke that is bad in cigarettes. From what I've heard, vapor is less harmful due to the fact that propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin are soluble while smoke is not meaning vapor is not harmful to inhale. But what do I know?"

AskLEO,3adjmx,lightning_strike1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:39:55 2015 UTC,"I've heard a lot of bad things about Grossman, basically that he writes/talks a big game but never actually did anything in combat/law enforcement like the topics he writes about."
AskLEO,3adjmx,pooplr,2,Fri Jun 19 16:43:48 2015 UTC,"Well in his defense,  he never claims to be a badass.  All his writing is research based.  On Combat is good because it talks about the different ways a person reacts to a shooting before, during, and after."
AskLEO,3acm0a,DocBrownActionFigure,8,Fri Jun 19 00:41:00 2015 UTC,"There should be a number you can call to check inmate status. Most of the agencies around me have a website where you can check this info.  They probably will not give you too much info, but will usually tell you if he is in custody and where he is being held."
AskLEO,3acm0a,ccxsilent,6,Fri Jun 19 01:09:31 2015 UTC,Yup! Call the city and county jails if they don't already it available online.
AskLEO,3acm0a,avatas,2,Fri Jun 19 05:04:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, who is in jail is typically always public record with the exception of juvenile detainees. Just phone the jail and request to know. In fact records laws in most states would allow to even obtain a copy of the report altogether once formal charges have been filed."
AskLEO,3adig5,DrHateface,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:01:20 2015 UTC,"Might be beneficial to add which department you are in the process of joining. As for me, I just got accepted to Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the first interview seemed cut and dry.  A deputy asking questions off a list and recording it, I got a response back right away as to whether I passed or not. The lieutenant's/captain's interview did have a set of questions, but it was more extensive.  Don't answer with general answers like, I want to help the community, or I want to prevent crime. Thats a given. Give a genuine answer without BS. Prepare to go into detail, and be confident and honest with your answers.  The last interview, atleast for LASD, was to see if you had what it takes to get through the academy and training without the department wasting money on a flake."
AskLEO,3a9b7q,jjbuttcheese,6,Thu Jun 18 06:40:42 2015 UTC,"This is going to vary widely from department to department, region to region, etc. some departments that are close in proximity may use the same or similar 10-codes/vernacular, but there is no standard."
AskLEO,3a9b7q,actuallyitsamy,0,Thu Jun 18 08:21:18 2015 UTC,"10-33 is usually some variant of ""emergency traffic"", ""officer down"", or the like, and 999.   Other than that, the only somewhat universal codes are 10-4 ""acknowledged"" and sometimes Code 4 ""situation clear/under control/okay"""
AskLEO,3a9b7q,matta997,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:42:36 2015 UTC,"No it's not. This greatly varies from city to city and state to state. Its for this reason that after 9/11 the Federal Government began publishing NIMS material to phase 10 codes completely out and use plain talk. I think the only ten code that can classify as ""generally means"" is simply 10-4 because of its usage in popular culture and not necessarily law enforcement work."
AskLEO,3a7l49,Cresneta,8,Wed Jun 17 21:17:37 2015 UTC,"When you get tailgated, you should always slow down gradually, so you can increase the safety distance in front of you so you have more time to react less swiftly to any situation, and reacting less swiftly will mean your ass-sniffer will be less likely to bang you back there.  In addition, slowing down may give him the incentive to finally pass you.    Back in the time when I had my motorcycle*, I had adjusted my front brake to be able to turn on the brake light with the slightest touch that did not apply the brake; it did wonders to get rid of tailgaters while I actually accelerated…  One day, I had a particularly insistent ass-sniffer, so when I got rid of him, I heard brakes squealing followed immediately by a big BANG!! Turns out the ass sniffer had one ass sniffer of his own…  * This was more than 30 years ago, so the statute of limitations has kicked-in for a long time…"

If you lose sight of the vehicle you could still call buts its unlikely anything further would happen. Only take video or photo if you are a passenger.
