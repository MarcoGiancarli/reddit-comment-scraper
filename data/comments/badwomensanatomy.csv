So, why would you edit out the crux of a comment I made, or indeed, ignore my other comments I made and cherry pick one that didn't have much about Ellen Pao in it?

We clashed for years in /r/feminism, /r/feminisms, and /r/equality when he'd pull MRA shit, pushing his conspiracy theories about a global groups of feminists wanting men oppressed in so many ways.  Entire threads of people would explain to him how he's wrong, how no actual feminists IRL have those opinions, then he'd just go to another thread and repeat them. Then I'd call him an asshole.  the mods of /r/feminism or /r/feminisms I can't even remember, tried to extend a peace offering by making him a mod. What did he do? he immediately banned all other mods and set it to private.  Saying that he was just so tired of not being listened to. Being listened to meaning, of course, that he could lie in any way he'd want and people would just believe it.  he was proven to be using sockpuppets to compliment and 'debate' himself.  when he made /r/mensrights and feminists such as myself still hounded him for using it to spread lies, the bot /u/truth_insert was created.  We called out kloo2yoo for it, and the day he left reddit (which of course wasn't permanent) was the same day the bot went inactive and the account eventually deleted.  AMR was born out of exasperation because of the way MRAs would trick their ways into modship among inexperience mods of feminist-ish subreddits and turning them anti-feminist via policy changes and deceptive moderation.

badwomensanatomy,3azusd,stormkeeper,25,Wed Jun 24 22:00:34 2015 UTC,Ironic since all humans start life as female until the Y chromosome kicks in.
badwomensanatomy,3azusd,llordylord,11,Thu Jun 25 02:31:32 2015 UTC,"wow such a shit science   Is female the default sex?   Biologists have been saying for half a century that female development is a default outcome, that somehow all human or mammalian embryos are initially female and then can have masculinity imposed on them. I don't think that the available data supports this idea. Certainly making an ovary, making a female, doesn't happen spontaneously. I think instead the way embryos initially develop is in a form that are anatomically and microscopically indistinguishable, but neither male or female.   In fact, during the first six weeks of human development there are no anatomic or microscopic distinctions between XX or XY embryos, but instead all the pieces are put in place during those first six or seven weeks of development for that embryo to ultimately develop as either a male or a female. And what follows after the first six or seven weeks is a series of decisions made within the embryo.   For example, the embryo must decide whether its embryonic gonads will develop as testes or ovaries. Once it makes that decision the embryonic gonads secrete hormones that determine the fate of the external genitalia. But the beginnings for both male and female structures are present in all human embryos and so it's really from a sort of a common a single model that female and male development follows.  Both the male pathway and the female pathway are very active and require highly orchestrated, highly integrated sets of events, extremely complicated biochemical cascades that we're only beginning to understand. And truth be known, the prevailing textbook models of how sex differentiation unfolds are extremely biased in favor of the male. So our present textbook understanding of sex differentiation in mammals is really a story of how does a male develop. The story of how a female develops has yet to be written.   http://www.learner.org/courses/biology/units/gender/experts/page.html"

In fact cave art, believed to be a precursor to social media sites such as Tumblr, depicting neanderthals dragging women home by their hair was the first recorded use of SJW false rape culture tactics in early humans."
badwomensanatomy,3azusd,arostganomo,11,Thu Jun 25 07:42:57 2015 UTC,Oh man I love this but it feels so frustrating that if you pitched this to him he just might believe it.

badwomensanatomy,3azusd,Kallisti50253,-16,Thu Jun 25 02:00:49 2015 UTC,Did someone call for a sublimely delightful individual?
badwomensanatomy,3azusd,RedPill4LYF,15,Thu Jun 25 19:44:21 2015 UTC,"So I'm curious, where does the actual vagina fit into your theory? Not the vulva as a whole, but the part that leads to the uterus."
badwomensanatomy,3azusd,Kallisti50253,-17,Thu Jun 25 20:42:16 2015 UTC,Reverse penis shaft. Duh. It's so obvious.
badwomensanatomy,3azusd,Yporti,20,Thu Jun 25 21:21:18 2015 UTC,But I thought the clitoris was a miniature penis. Does this mean that women have two penises?
badwomensanatomy,3azusd,Yporti,13,Thu Jun 25 21:24:00 2015 UTC,"No,  we have three! You forgot the cervix cock. We're clearly superior. We have more penis."
badwomensanatomy,3azusd,RedPill4LYF,8,Thu Jun 25 22:54:11 2015 UTC,No. Just you.
badwomensanatomy,3azusd,Yporti,-12,Thu Jun 25 22:53:27 2015 UTC,Enough redundancies. How can I help you?
badwomensanatomy,3azusd,arostganomo,10,Thu Jun 25 22:54:58 2015 UTC,Don't.

badwomensanatomy,3azusd,Admiral_Piett,18,Thu Jun 25 22:57:30 2015 UTC,Holy shit.
badwomensanatomy,3azusd,LupoBorracio,39,Wed Jun 24 22:54:14 2015 UTC,"Some thread highlights, for those who do not wish to stare into the abyss:   If you're honest with yourself and really look at it, ""women"" are less developed men in a physical sense. Their penises are so small they barely even protrude out from the crotch in most cases, so we call it a clitoris and tell them they're a different gender entirely so as not to offend them. (This explains why Feminism is so full of lies and makes women hostile to men, but we can get into that topic another time.) Their labias are ball sacks that didn't finish forming, so their balls go all the way up their asses and turn into ovaries. This basically makes women literal pussified men, and I guess that's why angry women insult men so much with that term. It makes sense that they use it unconsciously since it is a projection of such a deep insecurity.      Misery loves company, so they congregate together and talk about how men are worthless to make themselves feel better about having tiny micro penises. They talk about how to make men feel bad. How to shame them. How to keep the price of pussy at a premium so they don't have to work hard. They work together to spread lies about the plight of women for sympathy and extra resource allocation.       By contrast, all men have much bigger penises, so now we can all see that gender itself is a spectrum. Themost alpha of males have the biggest penies, and the most beta of males are actually what we call women. Men are capable of controlling their emotions and separating them from rational thoughts. They are solution-oriented. They are nurturing. Their bodies are stronger. They can stand up while they piss. They are basically superior women in most if not all ways.   Emphasis mine."

If you've just argued for paragraphs and paragraphs that women are actually just men on the betaest end of the he-man spectrum, sentences like that mean ... nothing?
