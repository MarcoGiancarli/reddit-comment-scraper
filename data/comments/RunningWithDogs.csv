RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,hey_Molly,13,Mon Jul 20 13:02:01 2015 UTC,lol. My dog and I pull about a 14 minute mile.
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,mysled,7,Mon Jul 20 15:28:47 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't force it.  Just take the dog out on your recovery runs where you aren't pulling a fast pace if shes not willing or able to go as fast as you'd like.    Not sure if this will help but one thing I've noticed with my dog is that she wants to start super slow, but after a mile or so warmup shes leading the charge and pulling me along for the ride."
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,puddy38,6,Mon Jul 20 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"I have a Golden who refuses to go under 9 min. I know he can do it, because he'll sprint around the dog park for 20 min. But the second I put a leash on him and try to go faster, he puts on the brakes. I suspect that it's just how he's wired."
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,rubberduck05,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:42 2015 UTC,ugh. I know exactly how you feel
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,misswestwood,6,Mon Jul 20 15:02:30 2015 UTC,"To echo what the others said, could just be their upper limit, or she just doesn't want to go any faster.  My dal can sprint like crazy when she wants off leash, but running with her she seems most comfortable to keep it at a fast trot.. between 10-12 minute miles, and she refuses to go any faster except for the occasional excited sprint when we first get started."
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,Roehok,6,Mon Jul 20 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"I use sound cues with my dog. I make a clicking or a kissing sound every time we're about to go faster. Walk to jog, quiet click, walk to run, kiss, jog to run, kiss, faster, kiss, all out, two clicks or a really loud kiss. If I want her to get going faster I just make more sounds. She's not very bright but she's caught on. I use 'easy' for slowing down."
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,firsttimetexan,3,Mon Jul 20 17:49:34 2015 UTC,"I do this too with my Australian Cattle Dog for running intervals. At the minute mark I tease him ""I'm gonna beat you!"" and he knows we sprint for a bit. He gets excited and bites the leash the first couple of intervals, but then he settles into the slow/fast pattern and expects it to happen."
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,TunaBoo,3,Mon Jul 20 20:33:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe she just isn't that fast of a dog?  I assume dogs have some kind of upper bounds like people do.  But she literally can't SPRINT say a 6:00 pace for 400m?  That is weird. I can understand her not running 10 miles @ 6:00.. but for a short sprint... bummer.  I think my Ridgebacks comfortable pace is about a 4:30, and he does pretty good in the heat. Some of it may be a breed thing, some of it could just be a personality thing."
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,DestructionDog,3,Mon Jul 20 14:44:32 2015 UTC,Want to trade?  My black lab won't go slower than ~7:00/mi when we're first starting - after 2-3 miles she'll slow down to my pace.  One time I let her set the pace and we did the first mile in 5:15....no sense of conservation at all.
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,feralfred,2,Mon Jul 20 21:51:05 2015 UTC,"Does your dog like to chase? You could try doing training-specific runs just for her by having someone run or cycle up ahead of you. When she's going faster than usual, lavish super-praise on her, and start to introduce your 'sprinting' command (try go go! or similar). Hopefully, she'll start to understand what's required of her."
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,mingusrude,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's not too bad. We have a Jack Russell Terrier that is similar. Whenever I run with him, he won't go below 9-10 minutes per mile and he certainly is well trained enough for it. We did find a trick to make him run faster though and that is to have my wife run in front of him. That way he does not to get too far behind and keeps a higher pace. Now all I have to do is to get my wife to run faster...  Jokes aside, try having some person that she knows run ahead of you. For us it works particularly well if it's on a trail or something that feels a bit ""tighter""."
RunningWithDogs,3dxwdz,Dogrunner530,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"Dogs use a lot more of their muscles when running than we do. She might just know her limits and not wanting to push those doesn't give in. Labs aren't built the same as Huskies either, huskies have been bred to push their endurance boundaries. Labs have been bred to retrieve which doesn't require as much endurance. You can start using a clicker and once a clicker is reinforced as something good use it to reinforce every time she runs at a faster pace. Don't hand her a treat unless it is a few pea sized training treats until after running to prevent bloat."

RunningWithDogs,3d9qxk,raplafch,9,Tue Jul 14 16:36:17 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  Like /u/Redditogo said, we do have a very extensive Wiki that has a lot of really useful info.  Link for the lazy: https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningWithDogs/wiki/training  Just so you know, I feel you with the training hours and dog leeriness; Abbey took four years of tears, sweat, and a lot of cursing to learn how to manage her leash reactivity and distaste of other dogs.  GSDs are beautiful and so worth the work, but good god, they are a lot of work and definitely need a job at home.  Running is one of the best ways to do that, in my opinion!  My biggest suggestion is always to focus on the training aspect in the beginning.  Directional Commands are SO handy. Abbey knows: Go, Right, Left, Around, U-turn, Slow, and Stop. I never even have to slow down when I'm running. I can simply give her the direction and she knows where to go.  She also has a focus command that reminds her that we're on our run (work mode) and that she needs to stop goofing around: Let's Go.  I also use this one when we cross paths with another dog.  It helps remind her to stay focused on the goal and to ignore the other dog.  Other than that one, I would suggest spending time ensuring that he has good curb etiquette.  This is one I don't see many people teach their dog. Your dog should know the difference between sidewalks/safe walking/running areas and actual roads. You would not want your dog to accidentally continue running into the road because they didn't know that it can be dangerous.   And finally, make sure that you build like you would for humans.  He will go with you until he physically hurts himself; dogs want to please us so badly, especially a work dog!  Don't rush into increasing distance or time too quickly."
RunningWithDogs,3d9qxk,helvetebrann,3,Tue Jul 14 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"I don't have much experience but I can tell you how we did. I run a couple of times per week and last summer we got a Jack Russell Terrier. The idea was always that he was going to be running companion although we were well aware that jrt:s aren't ideal for running (hint: short legs).   When he was around 8 months I started ""running"" the distance between two light poles with him on a leash. If he managed to run next to me without biting or jumping, he got a treat. The problem for him (and me) was that when I started to run he got very excited and started to bite and jump so it took some time before we could extend to two light poles and then three. I also did not want to start to go too long before he got older to save his joints.  And from there on we have gone longer and longer and today (he's 14 months now) we came home from a 7k run which went perfect. Where we live (northern Sweden) we can find trails where he can run without a leash which also works great. When he manages to run a few hundred meters next to me off leash he still gets a treat.  Even though a ran a lot before we got the dog, it's so much more fun to run with him as it keeps me focused on something as well. I mean face it, there are many things a lot more fun than running."
RunningWithDogs,3d9qxk,mingusrude,3,Tue Jul 14 17:50:22 2015 UTC,"The FAQs are a great resource for starting out.  I learned a lot.    When I first started running with my dog, I didn't do anything to protect her paws and I immediately fed her after the runs with no cool down.    Now I do a warm up/cool down with her, give her water during the run, keep her paws protected with musher's secret when she needs it, and give her a snack a half hour after the runs"

RunningWithDogs,3d7wh9,Duhreyyy,14,Tue Jul 14 05:11:23 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I'm not the most kid-friendly person - I don't really know how best to interact with them and prefer not to if I can help it. However, I do know how to protect my dogs. One of my dogs has bit before (not a child, thankfully), and that experience taught me very vividly that it's my responsibility to keep my dogs out of potentially dangerous situations - if something goes wrong, it's them who'll pay for it.  If a young child is running straight at us (something that's happened a few times), I will stop, pull my dog in close and get in front of him, physically putting myself between the dog and child. I'd also yell a sharp 'no!' at the kid (this works wonders on charging dogs too) whilst desperately looking round to throw an angry/panicky glare at a parent. Whatever happens, I'll keep myself between my dog and the child. I really don't think my dogs would do anything bad, but when we run they are naturally excited and playful - they could easily accidentally scratch or hurt someone, especially someone small. It's just best to keep them out of that situation to start with.  The second situation is different - I'm assuming these kids were a bit older or unsupervised? It honestly sounds as though you handled it perfectly. If that had happened to us I think I'd have dished out a short angry tongue lashing too.   When we are out running with our dogs, things happen so quickly and we need to respond quickly. With kids, I tend to do the same as with errant dogs - physically block them and issue a short verbal shock. Then move on as quick as I can!"
RunningWithDogs,3d7wh9,feralfred,6,Tue Jul 14 06:21:35 2015 UTC,"I second this comment completely. Especially shouting at (younger?) kids normally stops them in the tracks, oftentimes they run back to their parents asap.    Though it may not be ""nice"" or anything, it really works wonders."
RunningWithDogs,3d7wh9,Crotha,2,Tue Jul 14 14:14:55 2015 UTC,"I'll agree, I'm not exactly kid-friendly, either. I don't dislike them, but I don't know anyone with young children, so I really just don't know how to interact with an individual that doesn't have the grasp of language/reasoning/social understanding of an adult.   Thanks for the advice. Fortunately, I was sort of already standing between the child and my dog, and we were at the end of our run so I think he was just too exhausted to react. The kids were maybe 4-5, and their mothers were all present, but in true idiot adult fashion, they were standing at the other end of the park talking in a group and definitely not paying attention to their children.  I think by the time I had gotten the parents' attention, the whole thing was over and they probably just saw what looked to be a sweaty crazy lady with a Rottweiler yelling at a bunch of wide-eyed munchkins, haha."

Little kids and dogs are actually pretty similar in what they understand. If you know how to interact with a dog, you know how to interact with a child.    Yelling ""NO!"" or saying, ""You DON'T do that"" to diffuse the situation is the perfect response.  I think you handled it well!  Otherwise, just try to avoid these areas at these times in the future."
RunningWithDogs,3d7wh9,Pennoya,8,Tue Jul 14 18:03:37 2015 UTC,"I have a dog who is so wonderful at home but has been aggressive when she's in situations that scare her. When I run with her I have to just keep an open mind about where we are going and if I see anything that could be a problem ahead, I pull a 180 and turn right back in the direction from which I came. The other day I was jogging up to a park near my house and I saw an unleashed dog and several elementary school kids running around while their dad had his back turned and was chatting with a neighbor.. I had to recognize that, for my dog, that was a minefield and turn around. It kinda sucks when you have a path planned out but it keeps everyone safe and it's not so bad that I would stop running with her. Unfortunately, this is the only solution I've found because, even in my super dog-friendly city, lots of kids and people don't know that some dogs need space. I guess it's like: I can't control their behavior so I need to alter my own if I want to run with my dog.  There's also the yellow ribbon (or maybe it's yellow leash?) project. The idea is that if you put a yellow ribbon on your dog's leash or buy a yellow leash, it's supposed to signal to people that your dog needs space. The problem is that people (especially kids) don't know about it so it's not very effective."
RunningWithDogs,3d7wh9,ano463s,3,Tue Jul 14 06:35:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. I'd never heard of the yellow leash/ribbon project prior - sounds like there are good intentions there, but I agree, it's probably not well-known enough to be recognizable.   My dog is great with adults and other dogs, but he doesn't have enough exposure to young children to be entirely comfortable around them (particularly when they're acting boisterous and unpredictable). He's also a Rottweiler/Doberman mix, so I'm a little nervous about the use of anything that encourages him to be viewed from the stigmatic lens of being an ""aggressive"" type of dog. We try to be good ambassadors for his breeds. :)"
RunningWithDogs,3d7wh9,helvetebrann,5,Tue Jul 14 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"One of my dogs is ""shy and fearful"" which translates to scared of people (and stationary objects sometimes).  I agree with the idea that you can normally put yourself between yourself and whatever danger is present (human or otherwise).  Don't forget that if you're making a turn to get away from the danger, you'll need to turn ""into"" your dog (keep yourself between the dog and the danger), and it sometimes helps to run your hand down the leash to get closer to the dog's collar so they're almost pinned to your leg during this process.  It's an odd thing for them, but training them to accept this easily can make the difference in an extreme circumstance.  In the less extreme dangers, like where there's a child running at the dog in little-human-monster mode, I normally get their attention and politely ask them to stop.  I don't think it's necessary to try to scare them in most cases, plus I have a large dog, and don't want neighbors or such thinking that she's dangerous unless necessary.  Kids understand scared, so most of them get it when I say something like ""Hey, stop--my dog doesn't want to see anyone right now.  She's scared.""  Another thing that works is ""Sorry, she doesn't want to play right now, we're training/working/on a run/whatever.""  Also, of course, putting up your hand to block, etc can help with that type of kid.  Most of them aren't evil about it, they just don't know better, and this is an excellent opportunity for them to learn so they don't do it to your dog or others in the future.  Can't say I haven't been forced on occasion to pull out the ""She'll bite"" card, but that's been rare (and luckily she's never actually displayed that characteristic, it's just for show).    As far as the woodchips kid...  That's the one I'd probably yell at too.  That one would get a much more aggressive ""HEY!  NO.  You do not EVER throw things at dogs.  You never know what they'll do, and they can hurt you very badly.  NEVER throw anything at anyone, especially a dog.""  And that's the nice toned-down version for a 5 year old.  If a teenager tried to do something like that, I have no idea what I'd do...  Go into full dog-mom mode and rip them a new one?"
RunningWithDogs,3d7wh9,ghenne04,2,Tue Jul 14 12:22:41 2015 UTC,"Great suggestions on here already!  The only thing I can add is that there are leashes out there with ""warning"" labels on them.  (I put that in quotes because you were not in the wrong and shouldn't have to warn anyone that your dog doesn't like children; they were completely out of line and I would have been furious if I were you.)  Here's Abbey with her ""NERVOUS"" leash.  This is her old set-up and we've since replaced her leash since that one was dying.  It's bright yellow and has been really helpful.   I bought mine on Amazon.  They have a bunch of really cool options: no dogs (orange), blind (white), deaf (white), don't feed (purple), caution (red).  They also have them now in collars, bandannas, reflective dog jackets, and harnesses.    Note: I have zero affiliation with the company; I just happen to find them extremely useful given that I have a dog with leash reactivity."
RunningWithDogs,3d7wh9,invisiblecows,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:00:55 2015 UTC,"My dog loves kids, but she gets a bit antsy if the kids are making high pitched whining noises.   My general policy is that if I see kids coming directly toward us (as compared to walking with their parents nearby or minding their own business), I put her into a sit/stay. I then can stand slightly in front of her if it looks like the kid is charging right at her, and tell them that they need to ask before petting other people's dogs. When they ask politely I release her and she has a blast.   But in your case, you could follow a similar procedure and tell them that your dog is ""in training"" and they can't pet your dog right now. It helps to give kids an excuse/reason why they aren't allowed to touch your dog."
RunningWithDogs,3d7wh9,feralfred,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:40:07 2015 UTC,"I was so flabberghasted that I stopped in my tracks and said ""Excuse me. You DON'T do that."" to him. He gave me such a blank stare back (and I was so upset from what had just happened) that I literally didn't know what to say, and after a moment, I just turned around and kept jogging.   Sounds to me like you handled it just fine. The kid stopped, and you were able to continue your run. I think a loud ""stop"" or ""no"" should do the trick in most of these situations. (And if you're dealing with a kid who won't respond to a loud and forceful ""STOP THAT,"" it's time to find a parent and let them know their kid is physically assaulting people.)  For little toddlers yelling ""doggie"" and running at us, I hold out my hand, palm-forward, to keep them away while saying ""stop, don't touch.""  And honestly, most of the time if I'm out with my dog and I see kids, I cross over to the other side of the road and avoid them."

I live at sea level now and I'd have my hands full with my own health and well-being going up to altitudes. 3000m is not terribly high but...I'd check with the vet but honestly I'd leave my dog at home for that one. Maybe start with some lower hikes and see how she does before attempting the higher stuff.   Hope you can get her up there! Some of the best times that dog and I had were hiking 14ers.

RunningWithDogs,3cgirx,YoeSafBridge,3,Tue Jul 7 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"Anatolians are not always super connected with people.. They are livestock guardians that could spend days without human contact and view their charges as their pack and are less inclined to get really close to humans.  They are not like lab that loves everybody.  That being said, another dog might help.  But any second dog should be trained first to obedience, walking on a leash, sit, stay come etc.  that makes running with your dog much easier.  Also, your Anatolian may benefit from obedience class.  Even if the dog is 100% leash trained and knows its commands, the class can introduce the dog to other dogs in a controlled manner as well as other people in a controlled manner and learn some new things that can give the dog confidence.  Good luck!"

And keep stepping her up, reminding her the whole time that cars make treats happen.

As such it's really hard to recommend specifics when it comes to feeding. However - there is a really useful guide to help judge if you're feeding properly - The Dog Body Condition Chart. Getting feeding right is not an exact science, but knowing how your dog should look at a healthy weight is probably the best and most useful indicator."
RunningWithDogs,3bqm2g,feralfred,5,Wed Jul 1 12:52:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is something I'm constantly tinkering with. As our distance increases or decreases, our speed increases or decreases, I have to watch her weight very carefully and be very responsive to noticeable weight changes.   Personally, I suggest using the visual guide /u/feralfred already posted and doing a little experimenting with portion sizes until you find what works for your pup =)"
RunningWithDogs,3bqm2g,helvetebrann,2,Wed Jul 1 14:33:45 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much what I do. I tend to keep my dog between overweight and ideal, basically going down to ideal and then increasing food by about 10% when she's at or under ideal (since she always cuts down to it) and see where that takes us, we had never done more than about 1.5 miles together before, but she's been in different things where we upped her food, like disc dog, agility etc., so it's interesting to see what her needs will be with running.   I definitely increased the food too fast when we started jogging, my wife pointed out that she had already been walking the dog a few miles a day before we started jogging, so the dog wasn't doing that much more, if more at all, when we first started jogging, so in the first month she actually got closer to overweight when my wife said ""damnit what are you feeding her?"" Anyway, we both went on a cut together, me and the dog.   She's still a little overweight, for whatever reason she never loses the ab tuck from the side, but she puts on the weight up on the shoulders and the upper hips, so she loses that definition from the top view.   I'm going to keep monitoring pretty carefully as we up the distances, we hit 2.5 the other day, which is the longest I've run in years, the longest that she's run that I know of (she's a rescue, had her a few years now) and the intention had always been to jog with her, but you know, life was getting in the way and I had to simplify life to make time for both myself and also my little buddy."

I don't want to take it too far, but I think he's got it in him to do longer distances than that."

He started taking his lab with him for his ""short runs"" (he literally runs everywhere, like if he needs to go to the grocery store a mile a way, yeah he just runs) and built the dog up, dog can do a half marathon pretty easily now."
RunningWithDogs,3bqm2g,atob123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:35:05 2015 UTC,"Wow! I don't think a half marathon is in reach for me right now, but I love that he might be capable (maybe a few months or a year from now?!)."
RunningWithDogs,3bqm2g,TenNes,2,Wed Jul 1 19:51:59 2015 UTC,How much do you normally feed your dog? I generally give ziva an extra cup of chicken breast and an apple on the days we run vs the days we don't. She also gets a couple Tbsp of full fat Greek yogurt. Ziva is on the thin side to the point where my Vet told me to give her food if she look for it.
RunningWithDogs,3bqm2g,TunaBoo,7,Wed Jul 1 12:28:15 2015 UTC,"I wish I could go by his appetite but he could easily go through a bag of dog food and then still look hopeful when I move an inch towards the pantry. He's known for stealing entire loaves of bread, even once ate a whole stick of butter including the foil around it..."
RunningWithDogs,3bqm2g,wintercast,2,Wed Jul 1 12:40:07 2015 UTC,"LOL, sounds like my dog. Brought in a pizza for my wife to eat last week, didn't realize that the running had gotten her in good enough shape to be able to actually jump up onto the kitchen island and get things that were in the middle. Came back out of the shower, dog was on the Island, looking guilty, no pizza left."

At least he was smart enough to leave the bits that had toothpicks sticking out. The way he acts, you'd think you haven't fed him in weeks."
RunningWithDogs,3bqm2g,mysled,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:24:15 2015 UTC,"That is for a 150 pound person. I suspect dogs are way more efficient, and closer to 40-50 cals per mile."
RunningWithDogs,3bqm2g,Molybdenum-42,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"Good rule of feeding. Feed 1.5 % body weight for low activity dog. Most running dogs are going to need 2 to 2.5 % bodyweight in food   However moisture content and protein content play into food amounts.  The higher the protein/quality of the food, the less you need to feed.   Dry foods/kibble foods can increase bloat issues in some dogs, and feeding more and more kibble can increase likely hood of bloat or other gastric upset.  I personally make my own food, post with instruction can be found in my comment history.   Otherwise look for a high protein low carb food.   Beware of the new grain free hype. Some foods replaced something like brown rice with white potatoes.   Grain in any form (rice, peas, potatoes, corn, brewers rice etc) are all fillers."
RunningWithDogs,3bqm2g,ghostin_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"Really it's pretty much trial and error. As long as the dog is maintaining weight, you don't need to feed him extra. If he's losing weight, increase the amount until he is a good weight, then stick to the amount where he's maintaining but not gaining.   My dog does 12 miles of jogging, 5-10 miles of mountain biking, and 6-12 miles of hiking every week. I feed her about 10% less what the bag recommends for dogs that have a tendency to be overweight at her ideal weight (she's about 2-5lbs heavier than I'd like her to be right now, though she looks pretty darn good still).    So in other words, the bag says to feed a 33lb dog that tends to be overweight 1.875 cups a day. She's 38lbs right now. I feed her 1.75 cups/day.  Edit: Dogs are also pretty efficient exercisers and don't need nearly the calorie boost we do when we get a tough workout. You might want to double check the body condition chart and talk to a vet about where he's at; something like 75% of owners think their dog is ideal weight, but they're actually overweight. It's better in the long run to have your dog be a little lean than a little heavy."

RunningWithDogs,3bfl4e,findloveontherun,5,Sun Jun 28 20:01:08 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means an expert or frequent contributor here, but I think the answer is to properly leash train your dogs.  My lab and I went through puppy training, much of which focused on proper leash technique.  He went from pulling me along for walks to walking/running alongside me.  I'd highly suggest some guided training for your dogs!"
RunningWithDogs,3bfl4e,NoNotTheDuo,3,Sun Jun 28 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"The best that set up that I’ve found is:  A piece of webbing with a old harness buckle on it, wrapped around my waist. Mine is home made, but this is the same idea: http://www.wengerna.com/terrain-belt-12478  I bought a Granite Gear Absorber Dog Leash, cut off the snap clip that it came with, and replaced it with old climbing carabiners on both ends: http://gearx.com/granite-gear-absorber-dog-leash  The dog gets a harness: http://www.petsmart.com/dog/harnesses/kong-reflective-dog-harness-zid36-8496/cat-36-catid-100082  Running with it: http://i.imgur.com/dw3zOxw.jpg (This picture shows a collar on the dog. I used this for more control when training her, now the dog has the harness so she can pull on command)  Carabiner is clipped to the waist loop so it can rotate freely. The bungee leash keeps it from getting tangled (most of the time).   My dog is well leash trained with a regular leash and collar, and knows the difference between the two set ups. With her harness on, She will run along side me normally, and the command ""lets go!"" will let her sprint and pull me along, for a short time. Took a little getting used to, by both me and the dog, but it works well.  Saying that, I still vastly prefer running with her off leash on trails. I only use this stuff on the roads. She goes faster and longer when she isn't forced to go at my pace. I carry a small leash that I hold in my hand for the parking area, or when I see other dogs. I have a solid recall command."
RunningWithDogs,3bfl4e,nn2s2u,2,Mon Jun 29 05:25:58 2015 UTC,"We use a hands-free leash, which we recently transitioned to using. I used to just use a regular leash but I found I did get some tension in my dominant arm after long runs. Hands-free takes a lot of patience and practice - especially practice with starting and stopping and learning to read each other. I was worried about lunges when something really caught her attention quickly (like a rabbit or bird), but my dog seems to be pretty aware of the fact that if she pulls, she hurts me. We had one lunging experience and I pulled back on her with the same force that she pulled on me. It hasn't happened again.  For harnesses, we use a Vest Harness and have for a few years now. It doesn't have any pressure points or areas that rub. We used to use a basic harness, similar to this one, but it caused some rubbing underneath her armpits which caused her some pain. The vest harness is great, and the wide mesh panel on the front seems to breathe really well, so she doesn't get too hot. I highly recommend it."
RunningWithDogs,3bfl4e,0runnergirl0,2,Mon Jun 29 05:37:00 2015 UTC,We use an Easy Walk harness and it is working great. We've tried probably 7 or 8 different harness/leash combinations and I think the key is finding what is comfortable for you and your dog. I don't know that there is one standard answer that would work for every pair. Good luck!
RunningWithDogs,3bfl4e,purplegrapebunny,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:59:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for asking this- I'd like to know too. Mine's too unruly to use a waist leash and it gets really tiresome holding a standard leash for 10+ miles.
RunningWithDogs,3bd91p,Elizabeth092,7,Sun Jun 28 03:06:30 2015 UTC,I thought the general consensus was not to run with a dog before they were 12 months old to protect developing joints. I was told by the vet 18 months with my Weimaraner.
RunningWithDogs,3bd91p,Turbot_charged,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:18:45 2015 UTC,I've heard that too which is why we won't be doing any heavy running/long distances for a while.. Also gives me a chance to improve haha I just don't want her to be running with me and pulling every which way knocking out nearby runners as well
RunningWithDogs,3bd91p,feralfred,2,Sun Jun 28 14:33:49 2015 UTC,"It's generally not recommended to run with dogs of this age - they are still developing, and running with them can cause all sorts of joint problems in later life.   We have a handy guide for owners of young dogs! This wiki page was very thoroughly researched and put together by /u/helvetebrann, and is our subs 'official' stance on the matter.   However, if you have your vet's go-ahead to start a program of light running, then go ahead and have some fun! It sounds as though your dog loves to pull - mine do to, and I actively encourage them to do so! The biggest piece of advice I can give is to make sure your dog is wearing a comfortable and correctly fitted harness - one that is designed for pulling and will not restrict her natural movement. Also bear in mind that your dog is still growing, so keep checking that her harness isn't getting too tight for her - it may need adjusting quite frequently."
RunningWithDogs,3bd91p,Nowinaminute,4,Wed Jul 1 13:04:21 2015 UTC,"It's great you're asking these questions now. I've got a 14 yr old greyhound with chronic arthritis in her hips. People approach me all the time to stroke her and chat - but it's all about how weak and fragile she looks lately. My post lady told me only last week that the arthritis is due to over training as a pup, which might be true as we got her from a rehoming centre after she retired from racing at 20 months.  I always tried to run her at the cooler times in the day, and off the lead so she goes at her own pace."
RunningWithDogs,3bd91p,CaniXgirl,3,Sun Jun 28 18:47:46 2015 UTC,"Look into the sport of canicross! Sounds like your dog would love it! I have a shepherd/husky/malamute mix.

RunningWithDogs,3bd91p,deneeble,2,Sun Jun 28 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"I started my Rottie running with me when he was about 5-6 months old by doing the C25K. The vet thought it was fine.  I use a hands free leash with him. He is just out in front of me on my left. I didn't have much problem with him pulling. I do however use the leash and collar (a typical ""choke"" collar) to guide him when necessary."
RunningWithDogs,3bd91p,deneeble,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:54:49 2015 UTC,That's awesome! I don't want to be taking her long distances since she's still a baby but with the training program we can jog and walk. My jogging is really her trotting/walking lol how did you pace a hyper puppy? She just wants to go and all of our energy is spent in the beginning!
RunningWithDogs,3bd91p,notevenapro,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:35:44 2015 UTC,"First, I use a Garmin Forerunner. When we did the C25K, I had the walk/run intervals programmed in it. So when we went out, my Garmin would beep to indicate time to switch from run to walk, or vice versa. When that happened, I would just say ""walk"" or ""run"" and adjust my pace accordingly. He got so he recognized that the beep meant things were going to change up, and he would cock an ear at me for direction.  The second thing is using the ""choke"" collar. Applying pressure to him via the leash connected to the collar reinforced the need to change pace, and also not to pull. Harnesses do not provide this kind of physical feedback to the dog."
RunningWithDogs,3bd91p,notevenapro,2,Sun Jun 28 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"Harnesses do not provide this kind of physical feedback to the dog.   They do if you train them with a verbal command. All three of my dogs run with harnesses and when I tell them to slow, they slow down."
RunningWithDogs,3bd91p,Dogrunner530,2,Mon Jun 29 11:08:45 2015 UTC,You have a good 6 months to teach your dog how to be polite on the leash. I use a pet safe dog harness which helped me stop the pulling. I also have a regular dog collar and attach the two with a d ring.
RunningWithDogs,3b11dg,SenorStigo,10,Thu Jun 25 02:42:45 2015 UTC,"please keep in mind that humans are much better at running and releasing heat than all, if not most, other mammals.   Dogs can die from the heat. The can also suffer from a really bad heat stroke that might damage their organs and take years off their life.   I'm in Taiwan where the temp tops around 40ºC (104f) and vets warn about this. I almost had a dog die of heat stroke from chasing a snake for 5 min on a short hike, in the shade! some people come home to find their dogs dead in their house because they didn't leave the AC on."
RunningWithDogs,3b11dg,serpentax,11,Thu Jun 25 15:35:52 2015 UTC,Generally it's cooler in the morning. Can you adjust your schedule to run with her in the early morning?
RunningWithDogs,3b11dg,Mokelachild,6,Thu Jun 25 03:51:32 2015 UTC,"I have similar problems with my dog. In winter she can run forever, but she just gets too hot in summer.   Is it possible to either go running early in the morning or long after the sun goes down? We switched to running first thing in the morning as my schedule allows, and I decreased our distance by a lot until it gets cooler out.   For surface temperature, the general rule of thumb is that if it's too hot for you to hold your palm or bare foot to for 10 seconds, it's too hot to walk your dog on (I've also heard the same rule for 30 seconds of contact). Air temperature is not a good indicator of how hot asphalt or concrete can get, and if asphalt has been baking in the sun all day, asphalt can be 40-60 degrees F hotter than the air temperature. To put that in perspective, you can fry an egg in 20 minutes on a sidewalk at 130 degrees F. Asphalt in 87F air temperature has been recorded at 143F in the sun; I can't find data on what asphalt might be with air temperatures in the 100's! Because asphalt is so good at absorbing solar radiation, it will stay hot longer in the day, as well. So even after sunset it may be too hot to run on.   Some people report good luck with protective booties or paw balm/wax (like Musher's Secret). My dog won't tolerate booties, but YMMV. Even with booties or wax, your dog's paws can still be severely burned if you run on sun-baked asphalt with high air temperatures."

RunningWithDogs,3b11dg,feralfred,5,Thu Jun 25 05:31:11 2015 UTC,"I know some people recommend dog boots to protect the paws, but bear in mind that the paw pads are one of only two parts of a dog's body that 'sweats' (the other is the nose) - so covering up the paws in high temperatures may not be a good idea.  I'd go with running as early in the day as you can, as the pavement is at it's coolest first thing in the morning. If you find you need to use boots, consider adding a cooling vest too to help your dog regulate her temperature.  Check out our summer wiki page for more ideas!"
RunningWithDogs,3b11dg,7rider,3,Thu Jun 25 14:56:02 2015 UTC,"On warmer afternoon runs, I'll spray my dog down with water before we run. As the water evaporates from her coat, it helps keep her cool. It only helps extend her run by 1 to 2 miles, but on warm days, I only run 3 to 4 miles with her."

I know that if it is 90 and humid, there's a good chance I'm going to have issues with the heat and almost passed out on a 3 mile run last week. There is no way she can do it.

Establish a route that takes you to 5 different pubs, ideally all spaced about a mile apart from each other. Load up a backpack with 20-40 pounds of bricks/sand/steel plates (h/t /r/goruck). Make sure to pack water and sunscreen and whatever else you need for a weighted hike, and off you go. Its best if you go with a group of 5 because at every pub, someone gets the round. Go to the pub. Drink a pint. Go to the next pub. Drink a pint. Repeat. Socialize, hang out, play some cornhole when you realize you can't walk straight.  There's also something called a 5 Pack 5K, which goes like this. Grab a 6-pack of a beer you like. Drink a beer before you start. Run 1k. Drink a beer. Repeat. Bear in mind that you have to carry the 65-Pack with you on the run.  Lola decided to pose for a pretty picture at 10 Barrels pub.

It was in Poland, in Bydgoszcz. The run was called ""A gallopade of little brothers"" which I thought was quite cute! :)  I just watched your video on getting a dog accustomed to the treadmill...! I need to keep in mind when winter rolls around (all the salt on the ground is horrible for his paws even though the temperature is just fine for him!)"
RunningWithDogs,377tjo,junebugamok,7,Mon May 25 21:12:55 2015 UTC,Awesome!! What harness/rig are you running with? Do you need particular equipment to run an actual race or is anything generally accepted as long as the dog is somehow connected to you?
RunningWithDogs,377tjo,Redditogo,4,Mon May 25 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"We're running with Julius K-9 belt harness and running belt of the same brand. The harness is pretty darn great (with a little handle on top to hold him and you can attach the dog's name) but the belt not so much. It has a nice amortisation and is pretty durable however it keeps moving up. I read that some more professional running belts have lines that go under your ass and keeps the belt on your hips and prevent from any injury.   In the race anything was accepted (also leash and collar) but most people ran with belts and harnesses. In the professional league you need a harness though and a line that is at least 3m long. Also, the dog has to always be in front so since I want to take it a little bit more professionally I need to get him used to running in front of me rather trotting next to me as we usually do on our runs. But as you can see from the pictures, he's pretty happy about that arrangement. I'm also looking to buy a sled harness so it's easier for him to pull me (my weight is differently distributed than with the regular harness)."

RunningWithDogs,3789em,shitjoesays,4,Mon May 25 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"Congrats and welcome to the sub!  Honestly, using the C25K program is (in my opinion) one of the best ways to start as a dog runner!  The C25K program gives your dog a chance to learn the commands that you'll be working on her with (slow, stop, etc.).  Plus you both get to build endurance together!  A few suggestions for you, since you're just starting off!  1) Watch the heat.  The rule of thumb that I've found on most veterinarian sites suggest not taking your dog if the  the combination of the temperature plus humidity added together is greater than 150. For example: Temperature - 75°F, Humidity level - 80%. 75 + 80 = 155 then it is too hot for your dog!  2) Consider carrying a hydration system for your dog.  Dogs can't regulate their body heat as well as humans can and it is definitely helpful to make sure they have access to water during a run.  3) You might want to consider purchasing and using something like Musher's Secret.  It's a special wax to keep your dog's paws healthy.  I find it very useful using it, especially since, like you, I'm an urban runner.    4) Finally, take a look at our training page.  We have a bunch of really good suggestions centered in one spot to help make sure that your runs go smoothly and that both you and your dog are safe!"

RunningWithDogs,3789em,feralfred,2,Tue May 26 01:18:30 2015 UTC,"Not much to add to what's already been posted - but I would suggest (if you don't already) - giving your dog a high strength joint care supplement. There is quite a different level of stress put on the joints and muscles when running as opposed to walking (for people too!) - and given that she is already six, it can only help ease her transition into runner dog status.   I haven't done the pooch to 5k personally - but I've heard it's a very well structured training program, and an excellent place to get started. Good luck!"
RunningWithDogs,3789em,vmcbain,1 point,Thu May 28 14:11:37 2015 UTC,"I have a 5 yr. old boxer lab mix and I like to give her a few minutes of running around outside (after I get her gentle leader on, because then she knows its time to run) to sniff around and get rid of a bit of energy and pee.  This helps with less stopping during the run for pit stops and sniffing. I use a gentle leader, because as you know boxers are all muscle and a harness or choke collar doesn't work. I find with my dog she can't really go farther than 4-5 miles (she starts giving me the are we there yet look). So I go without her, or split my run if I'm going long."
RunningWithDogs,3773yo,Leeacass,3,Mon May 25 12:35:37 2015 UTC,"So Lola, the GSD, is my normal running partner. We usually go on several 3 milers a week plus a long run on the weekend. But I'm currently dog sitting for a friend and they said they didn't mind if I took Bandit with us on our run.  Lola is very well behaved on the leash, and almost always keeps it slack right by my side.  Bandit on the other hand has never been taught leash etiquette and likes to pull bad.  Well I guess doggie see doggie do because today Lola wanted to pull right up next to bandit and I had to continually correct her.  I guess I'll see how she does after bandit goes home and hopefully she didn't learn any bad habits.  I used a ruffwear roamer belt leash for Lola and a no name brand tied to the roamer for bandit."
RunningWithDogs,3773yo,junebugamok,4,Mon May 25 12:42:18 2015 UTC,"I have two big dogs who are relatively easy going and well behaved when walking/running individually. When they are out together, though, everything turns into a competition and all bets are off. I'm talking pulling, jumping, attempts at wrestling. Something about being out at the same time flips their switches to turbobutt mode -- needless to say I alternate which dog I take out each time I run and we're all happier for it. :)"
RunningWithDogs,3773yo,feralfred,2,Mon May 25 14:33:55 2015 UTC,"I can't run my two together either. One of my dogs is an idiot Lurcher - and in true Lurcher style he'll laugh and tease and nip and nip at my other dog to make him go faster. Poor old Fred does what he can to get away, but his legs are too small and he ends up stressed and snappy. Meanwhile, I'm at the back of it all hanging on for dear life.....  I adore running with my dogs as individuals, but together ends in disaster every time :( I'm so envious of those who can!"
RunningWithDogs,3773yo,hi_from_brian,2,Mon May 25 15:17:12 2015 UTC,"I hear you! I mountain biked with two dogs for the first time a couple of days ago, and it was quite different than just having one. My dog always stays about 8 feet behind my back tire on the downhill, but our visiting dog liked to be in front, so I was bracketed the whole time. The thing is, though, she's not used to being around bikes at all, so I had to work with her on saving the sniffing for the uphill sections.  We got a system going, and she ended up doing fine, and was fast enough to stay ahead of me most of the time. That last mile and a half was pure, unadulterated fun for all 3 of us, and both dogs slept hard that night."
RunningWithDogs,3773yo,kate-aclysm,2,Mon May 25 14:49:29 2015 UTC,Try a y leash extension! It makes it much easier.
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,lalalindaloo,17,Wed May 20 19:58:15 2015 UTC,"Dogs can't sweat. They can only cool themselves by panting, and the mouth has a lot less surface area than your whole human body. Dogs are generally not equipt to run in heat. Your dog isnt faking you out, he really is hot. Try running when it is cooler, hosing him down before you go, or leaving him home."
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,Calamintha,12,Thu May 21 01:58:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, y'all are right, it's definitely the heat. Held off until later yesterday evening to go out with him. The temp was down to about 68-70 with relatively low humidity and our run was just fine. Looks like either we'll be running in the evenings once it cools down (if it has cooled down enough) or I'll become a morning person. Thanks all!"
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,cmcdonald22,8,Thu May 21 12:47:38 2015 UTC,"An extra trip to the vet isn't going to hurt, but yeah, depending on heat and humidity and whether or not he's used to it it makes a huge difference.  In winter my dogs can walk 8 miles and never feel a thing.  Today we walked 2 (about 6 hours after our normal morning run) and they were ready to collapse in front of the fan instantly when we got home."
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,gnomes616,6,Wed May 20 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"My little Gordon did great all winter on our little 1.5 mile run, up from intervals in the fall. We had our first 80 degree day a week or so ago, and he was miserable. I got his little pool out, water in the fridge, ice cubes ready for getting back... Sometimes I'll splash his back with water and soak his coat a bit before we go when it's hot and humid. I've heard people say a soak in luke-warm or cold water is good, since it's more water to evaporate out of the coat, and some people say it's no good (maybe for double coat, because it gets trapped?). Maybe look in to cooling vests, too!"
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,Crotha,6,Thu May 21 04:59:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think a double coat traps the moisture and thus creating a rather hot fur, reducing the natural insulation.  especially when the sun burns down on the moist fur.   That being sad, my dog (Wolfspitz, much fur, so fluffy) likes when she gets wet at the underside, but if it's hot enough, she never goes swimming (thus the back remains dry). I think there is a grain of truth in this, but I am sure also much humbug."
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,esseffgee,5,Thu May 21 08:15:20 2015 UTC,"A friend has a small spray bottle that he takes when he runs with his dog.  Sprays the dog's belly periodically when it's warmer out.  Seems cumbersome to me.  I'm working on being a morning person again, instead."
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,Crotha,3,Thu May 21 16:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also take the long walks now in the mornings and, more likely, in the evenings. Also nicer for the dog to not walk that long in the afternoon-heat xD"
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,fox112,2,Thu May 21 21:07:19 2015 UTC,I've never heard of a dog faking so you will bring him home.
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,Crotha,4,Thu May 21 07:16:56 2015 UTC,"Well, I know one... He starts panting and limping and whining after about 15-30 mins of walking (no matter the temperatures) xD But he doesn't know that his little play is way overdramatic so you just see he is faking it.   Though in this case, I don't think that's the problem. He just sounds hot."
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,ano463s,9,Thu May 21 08:09:50 2015 UTC,"lol  yeah, not while running, but mine hates rain so much, he fakes peeing so you'll let him come back in when it's raining.  I did my business, let me go in now....  Seriously dude, if you'd just pee, you could actually go in.  I can tell if there's nothing coming out of there.  :p"
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,CBML50,3,Thu May 21 16:25:24 2015 UTC,"i discovered my dog hates morning runs.  He won't drag so much that I take him home or anything but he is just really not into it.  Wait 12 hours and he's good to go.  Thus, I now run mostly at night.  dog wins."
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,CaniXgirl,3,Fri May 22 02:22:58 2015 UTC,My dog is the same way. Now I've adapted to being an evening runner. Too bad there aren't more night races (;
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,CBML50,1 point,Sun May 24 16:31:28 2015 UTC,Haha. I am actually trying to train for a non-dog friendly half and include him on my shorter training runs. Especially in the Morning so that he's tired when I leave for work. No such luck
RunningWithDogs,36o19n,CaniXgirl,2,Sun May 24 20:45:59 2015 UTC,"He's helped me train for 2 halves, starting training for a third in July. He's done up to 12 miles with me but I bribe him by taking him to the dog park at the end of our runs. And we still can't leave until 10am on my days off for a longer run. (Unless there's snow, then he'll be up at 5 am raring to go, which is usually why I end up doing winter races.) Sigh."
RunningWithDogs,36eqe3,AgalychnisCallidryas,4,Mon May 18 20:31:45 2015 UTC,"Not my video and I couldn't do the race this year, but I have ran this in the past with my four-footed partner and without a doubt, the DD15K is one of the toughest but also one of the most fun races I've ever done - and very well organized!!   EDIT: HIGHLY recommend this race for any running dog and their human companion within driving distance. Be sure to watch their Facebook page and register early!!"
RunningWithDogs,36eqe3,McDingus69,3,Mon May 18 20:35:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, I wish I could do this one. I'm somewhat nearby. If only the tri-state area had more races like this, I've got a beast of a weimaraner runner."
RunningWithDogs,36eqe3,notevenapro,3,Tue May 19 15:15:21 2015 UTC,This was pretty damned cool. Thank you.
RunningWithDogs,36eqe3,wintercast,3,Mon May 18 22:43:58 2015 UTC,great video.  thank you for posting.
RunningWithDogs,36fufq,MegaRob,3,Tue May 19 01:38:24 2015 UTC,"100% recomend RuffWear Palisades Pack.  I used it for my GSD and it was great.  http://www.ruffwear.com/Palisades-Pack_2  Some images make the bags look like they stick out really far, but i could squish them to the dogs body.  I normally had some water in them, often a bladder for the dog, and one for me.  and then some poop bags and a toy/treats or a snack.  Although, in the end i admit to not using the pack as much as the harness itself.  The pack can be removed from the harness and then you have a really awesome harness.  I normally have a camelpak type bag i carry on myself, and my dog figured out how to drink from the mouth piece (i hold it to squeeze, dog licks water).  In the pack i will have poop bags, snacks for dog and myself.  The pack i have is really made for folks that bike ride, so it has a mesh helmet holder that folds out.  Great for carrying wet toys or poop bags."
RunningWithDogs,36fufq,wintercast,1 point,Tue May 19 19:06:15 2015 UTC,Does velcro hold the bag well?   I was on Ruffwears web site and found the Ruffwear singletrak pack.  http://www.ruffwear.com/Singletrak-Pack-Dog-Pack?sc=2&category=13  Have you or anyone else used this before?
RunningWithDogs,36fufq,wintercast,1 point,Wed May 20 19:37:14 2015 UTC,The bag secures with clips.
