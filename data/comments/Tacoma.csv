Tacoma,3e31i1,PenitentRebel,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:57 2015 UTC,"So I think it's:    Write down VIN, license plate number, odometer.  Set a good safe test driving area after screening potential buyers.  Check driver's license.  Create a bill of sale (available on the DOL website).  Go to a bank to transfer money or verify cashier's checks.  On the title, report the exact odometer, sign the section as a 'seller', record the total sale price.  Hand it over as well as a copy of the bill of sale.  Fill out a report of sale online with the DOL afterwards.   The buyer takes over after step 5 - the vehicle is theirs at that point.  They have to do the rest of the title transfer and pay any other fees and taxes and whatnot.  I don't see anything about fees or things and I think I read somewhere that the sale doesn't have to be mentioned as income on tax returns because it's automatically assumed to be a loss of value.  Does that seem about right to everyone?  EDIT:  Included bill of sale"

Tacoma,3e31i1,harborhound,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:20 2015 UTC,Thank you - I updated my little list.
Tacoma,3e31i1,harborhound,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:03 2015 UTC,"Ok,  I feel the need to spread some knowledge here as I've owned 30+ vehicles all that I've sold myself on craigslist.  I'm also a subaru enthusiast and drive a wrx now have had an sti as well so I know the market.    Print off 2 copies of the bill of sale form on the dmv website. Both fully fill out both and keep a copy for each.  You can pre fill out the generic info before you print it so it looks professional.  Only accept cash. No cashiers check, no personal check, no bank will send a check because they need a loan nonsense.  Hardly any bank will loan on a 2003 so you will be getting cash only buyers.    Meet in a public place for the sale.  I usually hold their drivers license, insurance card, and car keys and just let them take it for a little spin.    Don't pre negotiate.  Tons of people around here try to double up.  Say your price is listed at 10k they call and you agree on 9k.  They will get there and say ahh I didn't know they tires were low etc.  Will you take 8k?  If you do pre negotiate because they are at long distance make it clear you won't drop further.  It would also be a good idea to take it in to Pacific import auto for a full inspection. I think they charge 100 but it gives wrx buyers peace of mind around here and if you list on your ad that they recently checked it out it will get more interest.  Obviously clean the car inside and out to the best of your abilities and get nice pictures.  Fix any problems with the car.  Seems obvious but I regularly buy cars cheap with simple issues then resell for a profit after fixing.  Make your ad clear and to the point.  Nobody wants to read a story about the car.  Sorry on phone if format sucks and if I rhino of more I'll add it."
Tacoma,3e31i1,G37_is_numberletter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"This is a ton of great info, thank you!  I had planned to offer taking it to Roopair.  Would the seller eat the cost for the inspection or is it something I should get done once and have them give me a checklist of verified car things?  Also, since you're a WRX/STI owner, could you estimate a good starting selling point for a 2003?  It's in good solid shape and has never given me issues.  Handling is good, engine has been maintained with never any major issues and it drives really well.    Downsides are the air conditioner has a leak and will need to be recharged, it has typical wear and tear for a 12 year old daily driver and the back rear brake light should probably be replaced since it's got two small holes drilled in to let water out (it was retaining water).  Has about 186k miles on it.  Totally cool if you'd rather not make a guess."
Tacoma,3e31i1,TacomasLowlife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:05 2015 UTC,Roopair isn't bad but Pacific import auto has a lot of respect.  It's a cost you'll just have to eat/ work into your selling price.  Generally its worth it especially on turbo cars.  They will give you some paperwork you can show the buyer as a clean bill of health.  I'd get the ac fixed up first.  In this heat that's the first thing people will turn on when they hop in it for a test drive.  A/C issues can be simple or big so left unfixed can scare people off.  I wouldn't worry about the brake light.  Hard to judge price without seeing it but I'd start at 10k and see what happens.

Tacoma,3dyt9j,ChippyMalone,5,Tue Jul 21 02:51:06 2015 UTC,The mall should die a painful death.  It is the single solitary reason Downtown will never recover.  The city should lure the department stores away and give them space in the Brewery district.  Imagine having Macy's right above UWT and rows of small clothing and specialty shops all over the Brewery District.

Tacoma,3dyt9j,hilltopnavy,2,Tue Jul 21 23:16:11 2015 UTC,It would at least be more practical than the idiotic U-shaped Hilltop expansion of the streetcar.
Tacoma,3dyt9j,strangermouse,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:42 2015 UTC,I see the U as a good idea. Especially if eventually wraps around back down to the dome. From there everything else could radiate off that loop.
Tacoma,3dyt9j,lightjedi5,3,Tue Jul 21 06:28:06 2015 UTC,The u shaped expansion is the best way to get it up the hill and is the building block needed to support an extensive future link network. There is no other way to get link out of downtown. You can't go straight up because the grade is too steep. The last time Tacoma had a streetcar go up a grade that steep hundreds of people died. Those trains can't stop on those hills.

It's the speed leading up that they're hitting me for. Coming off of Pioneer and onto EB, I don't see a 35 mph sign anywhere until after the curve. I posted a street view, can you tell me where you see it? I just looked again. Take it like you're heading North from  Waller, on Pioneer, and then onto EB street.

Tacoma,3dx51q,hamcat666,3,Mon Jul 20 07:04:17 2015 UTC,"As a kid growing up in the Northwest, we'd do ""earthquake drills"" - dive under a (STURDY) table, cover your head with your arms, and wait for the shaking to stop. If you're a homeowner, one thing to check is that your house is bolted down to your foundation - many of the older homes don't have this, and so in a decent earthquake run the risk of ""hopping"" off of their foundation - my understanding is that it's a fairly easy retrofit.  One suggestion I would have is to check out if the local Red Cross (Mt. Rainier Chapter) is doing any tabling or training soon - they have pamphlets on disaster preparedness, and a good checklist for putting together an emergency kit.    As to ""the big one"" - the ""average"" interval between these megathrust earthquake in the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) really isn't a good predictor, as unlike El Niños even, earthquakes don't occur on a regularly predictable interval. It could happen tomorrow, it could happen in 2000 years.

Tacoma,3dsyqu,ChippyMalone,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:56:47 2015 UTC,"Not saying there wasn't a NMAC, but it can look quite close when air traffic controllers use standard vertical separation of 1,000 ft.  Additionally, controllers can allow a pilot to maintain visual separation from another aircraft and in such cases there is no required separation other than to obviously not hit the other aircraft.  This means the aircraft could have less than the standard 1,000 ft. vertical separation or 3 nautical miles lateral separation."
Tacoma,3dsyqu,amocat65,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:38 2015 UTC,"Now that you put it like that, it makes sense that from my perspective, I saw their paths intersecting, but one could have been 1000 feet above and not a threat or anywhere near close as it looked to me.   Thanks."

Tacoma,3dc2l5,a_savoir,6,Wed Jul 15 07:46:32 2015 UTC,"The police don't need a warrant to request triangulation data from her cell carrier [as stated on the Facebook page]. That's either laziness or misinformation on the police's part or a misunderstanding by the person posting. If the cell carrier is being especially difficult and insist on a warrant they don't need, it wouldn't be difficult for TPD to get.  Most cell carriers delete triangulation data after 24-72 hours unless notified of an active police case.  This is their best chance at a solid location lead. They need to follow it. Asking people to ""blow up"" TPD/911 with calls is a great way to piss off the only people who can get that data without an insane amount of extra hassle.  I realize emotions are high, but they seriously need to follow through on this.  Failing this, as mclassy3 stated, if she has a smartphone, use Google or Apple's location tracking services."

I don't really know what I like anymore, to be honest. I generally don't have the patience/attention span for board games.  I have been enjoying going to parks, having picnics, visiting the new Root Beer Store on 6th, and going to coffee. I have a bike (and I like to ride) but I'm not the most svelte and swift rider.  EDITED TO ADD: You should message me :)"
Tacoma,3dawt5,red454545,2,Wed Jul 15 17:09:48 2015 UTC,"As a fellow former drinker, I had the same problem. Trying to find things that weren't alcohol centric can be harder than you would think.   I wound up doing a lot of hikes. If I can get even an hour free, I usually will do the Puget Creek Trail (http://www.metroparkstacoma.org/pugetcreek/). Then you can do a stroll up and down Ruston. Maybe a bite to eat. Makes for a nice evening.   You will also find that you have more energy and engage more in things. All of a sudden walking my dogs after work is a lot easier and enjoyable when I haven't had a few beers. From my experience, anyway."

My best friend is currently going through it with their management doing multiple messed up things and being caught red handed. Some units there have some decent views of the Narrows bridge. That's really one of the few positives I've heard from residents there. That being said, most places in UP/Tac are better than Parkland. With what you're looking for, I'd definitely suggest 6th/Broadway area. UP is also just 10-15 min drive to all nightlife in Tacoma (and Lakewood) so you can't really go too wrong either way IMO"

I have never played any tabletop RPGs, but would be interested in learning... especially if it's a post-apocalyptic RPG.   By the way, if you ever come across this game, I've wanted to play it since I played the PC version.  edit: Here is a link to the Nuclear War Card Game 50th Anniversary Edition Kickstarter."

We had 25+ at the last Stonegate event and I'd say fully half were 1st-timers.  The Game Matrix bi-weekly event will probably have 10-12 of us there, with a couple fresh faces. That'll be masked, though, by the fact that two other groups regularly meet at TGM on Wednesdays (a board game group and two full tables of RPGs in the back)."
Tacoma,3czqih,lightjedi5,2,Sun Jul 12 07:14:46 2015 UTC,What kind of boardgames are typically played?
Tacoma,3czqih,lightjedi5,2,Sun Jul 12 13:21:52 2015 UTC,"We welcome all kinds but typically there are no long games (games that take 1hr+). That's really up to the group, though. many people push the envelope with games like Kemet, Letters from Whitechapel, and Quartermaster General (Which I wouldn't mind playing this week).    We often play Splendor, Forbidden Desert, Dead Panic, Pandemic, The A-Maze-ing Labyrinth, Star Realms, Paperback, Omen: A Reign of War, and plenty others."

I'm hoping to encourage more DM's to step up, as this is definitely a popular game. You're more than welcome to come and learn, and maybe shadow another player to get your feet wet. There will also be many other RPG's being played on the Saturday event so even if D&D doesn't work out, there will be many other choices.  We always welcome newcomers and are eager to teach and help facilitate play."

I've seen three in my appartment complex so far and not one picked it up. One got close once but she tossed it over the fence  instead.   She was 20 feet from the compactor.
Tacoma,3cz3f2,drinkNfight,3,Sun Jul 12 04:43:57 2015 UTC,Our complex has threatened to evict those that don't pick up after their pups... I still find the little satanic piles in front of the front office.
Tacoma,3cz3f2,Milkthistle38,2,Sun Jul 12 05:44:53 2015 UTC,I just don't understand it. Especially around my corner of the complex. The compactor is right there and there is a plastic bag container right there also.   Probably the same people that set there trash next to the compactor. It's like they ran out of batteries and didn't have enough strength to open the door.    /#rantingsorry
Tacoma,3cz3f2,ashamanflinn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:52:43 2015 UTC,I think when people put their trash next to a compactor that usually means the trashmen were unloading the compactor when they showed up to drop off the trash.
Tacoma,3cz3f2,MeoowDude,2,Sun Jul 12 15:00:48 2015 UTC,There's a complex that's using a service where they collect the dogs dna upon move in and then take samples of the poo and send it to the company for a matchup. THen they fine the tenant.

If you haven't been to Over The Moon Cafe ever I would recommend it. It's in Opera Alley downtown and it's very intimate and the food is really good. It's been there forever but they don't do much marketing so I feel like people forget to there.  Tacoma Cabana is one of my favorite places to celebrate my birthday.

Tacoma,3cgzeh,jd91durham,4,Tue Jul 7 20:56:36 2015 UTC,The Yakima river is pretty good.  You launch outside of Ellensburg and float for about 3 to 4 hours.
Tacoma,3cgzeh,Farva85,2,Tue Jul 7 21:00:27 2015 UTC,"Just did the Yakima last weekend; park at Big Pines campground then drive back up to ~mile marker 20.

Tacoma,3cgzeh,Cholosapien,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:35:05 2015 UTC,"For a more low key casual float, the Deschutes river in Tumwater is awesome. It's a white trash wonderland and generally a pretty chill atmosphere. The cops patrol for booze but only half heartedly.  Google Pioneer Park in Tumwater for directions. The nice thing about that park is, you don't need two cars. The river curves around the park so you're within walking distance back. And you typically can float down in an hour or less so you can float a few times."

There was definitely a lot of food vendors there, which wasn't really my main reason for being there, but it was nice to grab a bite. There were several bands playing throughout the day that were fun too. I also got some cool Tacoma-wear (always on the lookout for PNW pride).  We didn't walk all the way down to the end of the booths, but we made it down to the Ram to grab a beer (fantastic to have a beer garden on a hot day!). We left around 5 then came back for the firework show.   All in all I just thought it was pretty sweet to walk around and see everyone else who lives in Tacoma and comes out for community events- it's not always that you get to see a bunch of random people you'd never run into otherwise :) And what a cool bunch of people you all are!"

The twats at 15 Now sat small business owners down a couple of months ago, and laid down a half-ass ultimatum to the businessmen, presenting the 15-dollar an hour minimum wage as a fait accompli. When (surprise surprise) small business owners called this ridiculous bluff, the 15 Now group went out and collected signatures, and fucked the whole process up. They eventually had to get ""professional"" signature gatherers on the job. 15 Now has refused to discuss how much the sig gatherers were paid, probably because it was less than 15 bucks per hour.  Meanwhile, the mayor and council put together a group with actual skin in the game to come up with proposals. They got two plans, either of which is better than the abortion 15 Now came up with.  The above is reals not feels, and reflects reality more than Anderson's gibberish."

Tacoma,3c5pe1,King_Atreides,2,Sun Jul 5 03:58:45 2015 UTC,Hm. I'm not sur-- Oh shit wait. That's right. Not run smear campaigns on city and taxpayer funds while delaying sending off a proposal to the auditor so they can have more time to campaign against a neutral vote with money nit meant to be used in that way while outright lying to people and saying it isn't a campaign.  I guess that's just too hard though :(
Tacoma,3c5pe1,fiendzone,0,Sun Jul 5 04:04:36 2015 UTC,The chamber used private funds. And there was no delay. Keep trying.

If it was out of their pocket private money then they wouldn't be needing to say or even discuss things like this, because it'd be their money. It's chamber of commerce money which has direct relation to the city and shouldn't be getting spent that way.   ""The Tacoma City Council has until 4:30 p.m. Aug. 4 to send the 15 Now measure to the county auditor for the November election, city attorneys now say.

Reporting that you need to do something by X date, then suddenly you don't have to and you're gonna wait an extra month. Either they're delaying it or they had no idea when they needed to get a proposal in to be on the general ballot - I'm not honestly sure which of those is worse, but I'm definitely gonna err on the side of 'regardless,  you shouldn't say something, then announce you're doing it later but in the interim HEY LOOK AT ALL THIS CAMPAIGNING WE'RE GONNA DO  I'm going to go enjoy my 4th now.

Tacoma,3c1il3,awkwardcool,8,Fri Jul 3 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"First off welcome to the PNW, and good call moving out of Tornado alley.  Lot of hills here huh?  I would recommend  checking craigslist.  You are more likely to find a private owner, than a property management group.    Some property management groups will work around bad credit if you can both show proof of making 3 to 4 times the amount of rent per month.    If just one of you does, I would recommend just they do the credit check and put the other as a person who lives  there but not responsible for the bills.    They also will usually charge a extremely high deposit in those scenarios.    Again, I would check craigslist for houses or privately owned little four-plex places.    Big complexes suck any way.    Hill top is not the best area, but it does have cheaper housing and more of the non property management group places available.    Parkland and the East side might be good to look at also.  And if this is your first time up here,  it is not usually this hot.  You are probably more accustom to it, but we aren't.    Hardly no places as far as houses or apts have A/C, but we do have the waterfront, point defiance, titlow, that have water access and trails that are a little cooler.  I used to work with a guy from Oklahoma.  Good guy.  Plays in a band here.  Haven't seen him in a while, but he represented good for the people there.  He is the hippie in the middle with the guitar singing.  Working with him, he had a soft spoken Oklahoma accent, talked kinda quiet, hair was always back, so it didn't get caught on anything.    When I went to see them play, it was like, dude, your a rock star.  And you will see his singing style is far different then a soft spoken Oklahoma accent. Wasn't expecting that, but they were cool.   Cool dude.  Good luck."

Business owners in towns and cities form these local societies to advocate on behalf of the business community. Local businesses are members, and they elect a board of directors or executive council to set policy for the chamber. The board or council then hires a President, CEO or Executive Director, plus staffing appropriate to size, to run the organization.

Tacoma,3bchgf,SpecialAgentSmecker,4,Mon Jun 29 04:47:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the real question is... who are you?  What to do, where to go, and the things you'll find interesting are pretty dependent on that.  An 18 year old girl and a 27 year old guy are going to get very different responses.  That being said, WA in general is a pretty good place to live.  I moved here about 3 years ago, and whatever you're into, you should be able to find it.  If you're into outdoors stuff, you'll love it.  If you're into a ripping nightlife... well, you'll need to look a little harder, but there are still places to go."

Come stocked with a fan or 8/get a decent portable ac or you'll be in hell. It's 91 degrees today and this is normal August weather coming 2 months early.   My girlfriend and I hike fucking EVERYWHERE. There are mountains, streams, trails, sound beaches everywhere to hike and the wildlife you'll see on them makes it so worth it. I have a few buddies out here that made the same move, we're all mid 20s so if you want to kick it!"

The weather in the Tacoma/Seattle area can get really hot in the summer time/abymsally cold in the winter time, and in between then... well it's raining. Tacoma has a decent amount of exploration/ fun things to things to do. There are many restaurants/ coffee ships that have collected praised throughout the years. Going downtown and to the waterfronts are beautiful. There are beaches here and there. There's also the Tacoma mall, which honestly isn't that special but there are several shops that you can take a look at.

Tacoma has changed a lot since the last time I lived here, but so far I've spent a looooooot of my time on varying parts of the waterfront. If you're into karaoke, Tacoma's a weirdly good place for that. If you're into drinking, Tacoma's an unsurprisingly good place for that, too."

Northwest Trek is a bit of a drive, but it's really fun.  You take a safari-like trolley through the property and see tons of animals.  I thought it would be lame, but I had such a good time!  Definitely go to the Red Hot; that's one of my favorite places.   Have fun exploring!!  I moved to Tacoma from Seattle, and I am in love with it already."

Even though we don't need another factor adding to the I5/16 jct traffic, I'd love for there to be a reason for people to come down to Tacoma instead of another reason to go to Seattle and, maybe this is just a pipe dream) a reason for them to push light rail production to have at least a Seattle-Tacoma line available."
Tacoma,3b4iv2,arnefesto,8,Fri Jun 26 00:03:38 2015 UTC,"Live in Puyallup. Wish the train ran all the time. It's my biggest complaint.  Mostly because of my misconception that public transportation operated at times that I wanted to be transported.   Why can't I take a train into town on the weekends? Or come home after an evening on the town?   As a disabled dude, I'm disappointed."
Tacoma,3b4iv2,ModernDayNeanderthal,5,Fri Jun 26 12:32:02 2015 UTC,"The problem with the Sounder is that it shares the track with BNSF's freight traffic. Since BNSF owns the track, their freight traffic gets priority. Unfortunately, it costs somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million dollars to add one trip to the Sounder.   Ideally, I'd like to see it run all day with a 30-minute frequency, but that would inevitably require Sound Transit to build their own track, which is also horrendously expensive."

Tacoma,3b4iv2,ModernDayNeanderthal,2,Fri Jun 26 21:33:05 2015 UTC,YES! Coming from Chicago I always complain about this. I live blocks from the Puyallup sounder station. I understand the tracks are owned by BNSF but I wish there was some way to ride into the city other than 9-5.   I brought up to a Sounder worker that one New Years there should be free public transportation in and out of Seattle to prevent drinking a driving but still giving everyone the opportunity to party. She loved the idea but said with BSNF owning the tracks it probably will never happen.
Tacoma,3b4iv2,chicitygirl46,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:10:15 2015 UTC,I think the tideflats has a big enough lot of real estate for an arena.  That would give quick access from all directions to disperse.  Tacomans can hop a bridge to downtown then through. 705 is a good relief from that direction as well. Up and over browns point to fedway/99  cut through fife to I5 even would do ok.  But yes traffic is a bitch to begin with throughout the puget sound.  Id get over it.
Tacoma,3b4iv2,belgiumania,7,Sat Jun 27 02:27:00 2015 UTC,We used to have the Sabercats at the Dome and that was always fun.

Tacoma,3b17ni,joshthewaster,8,Thu Jun 25 03:37:52 2015 UTC,With orca cards you just load the money on and then you just tap a little reader to et on the bus instead of doing cash. It's convenient and saves everyone time. From the tacoma dome to downtown on the 590 is between 45-1hour 15 min.
Tacoma,3b17ni,ashamanflinn,3,Thu Jun 25 03:53:54 2015 UTC,"ORCA cards can be loaded at many Safeway's, QFCs, and some bus depots/transit centers. The major benefit is not carrying cash/change and the transfers are automatic and carry between county metros/sound transit. Pierce and King county both give paper transfer slips when you pay with cash, each should be good for no less than 90 minutes from time of payment. Problem is, when you taken a metro bus with cash then want to board a sound transit bus... ST doesn't accept paper transfers. This is where the ORCA card shines. It is automatic and shared between all of them including metro to ST. See the ORCA site for more info. I have been using the same card for 5 years and have probably saved hundreds over conventional payment options. You don't even have to take it out of your wallet/purse so long as you don't have another RFID(?/nfc) enabled card in there.  Edit... Yes, as stated earlier. 45 mins-1 hour is normal. On bad traffic days or rushour times can be as high as 2 hours each way. It's about 35 miles so best traffic permitting 30 miles freeway and 2 miles downtown stop and go."
Tacoma,3b17ni,skilledscion,-1,Thu Jun 25 04:02:51 2015 UTC,"Edit... Yes, as stated earlier. 45 mins-1 hour is normal. On bad traffic days or rushour times can be as high as 2 hours each way. It's about 35 miles so best traffic permitting 30 miles freeway and 2 miles downtown stop and go.   If you're going to and from Seattle during normal work hours for the love of god do not take the bus. For the same price you can take the light rail which goes from downtown to downtown but isn't at the mercy of all the mouth breathers who cannot handle the slight curvature between fife and federal way."
Tacoma,3b17ni,GenericAntagonist,4,Thu Jun 25 10:27:05 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that the light rail does not connect the two cities. The Tacoma one doesn't leave tacoma and the Seattle one runs from seatac to downtown Seattle
Tacoma,3b17ni,aquaknox,6,Thu Jun 25 11:59:26 2015 UTC,"You are correct.  He might be thinking of the Sounder train that you can take.  I've found that, unless traffic is especially bad that day, it doesn't save you any time because it makes a handful of stops on the way to Seattle, whereas the bus doesn't do that."
Tacoma,3b17ni,CleverFunnyName,4,Thu Jun 25 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"This is what I am finding as well - pick your preferred mode and go with it.  You may get to Seattle 10 minutes earlier on the bus than the train, but the bus seems to rarely take much longer than the train does.  I prefer trains as mode, so go with that when it suits my schedule best."
Tacoma,3b17ni,bastardish,2,Thu Jun 25 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"Also with orca cards you can use them on the sounder train and on the light rail in Seattle. With those, you tap your orca card getting on and again when you get off.  Depending on where you live the sounder is a good option (1 hour from Tacoma to King Street)"
Tacoma,3b17ni,BorisCJ,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:40:51 2015 UTC,"Seconding this. I bike to the South Tacoma station, they have designated bike-parking/tie-up on each train car, ride it up to Tukwilla, and grab a bus to work, all the busses I've used have bike racks on the front.  Orca card means you can transfer as much as you want, and it only charges you the highest fare from the legs of your trip."
Tacoma,3b17ni,albinobluesheep,2,Thu Jun 25 16:49:23 2015 UTC,Check the monthly fares here: http://metro.kingcounty.gov/fares/#types-of-fares   And see if your employer offers commute trip reduction benefits (CTR). Here's some info: http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/transit/ctr

Tacoma,3b17ni,Brandomin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:04:58 2015 UTC,Right. You can keep extra in your e-purse in case you go over.
Tacoma,3b17ni,albinobluesheep,2,Thu Jun 25 06:17:07 2015 UTC,Doesn't that mean it's not unlimited?
Tacoma,3b17ni,Buckwheat469,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:22:07 2015 UTC,It means if you go over the max per-trip fare you chose.
Tacoma,3b17ni,ces614,2,Thu Jun 25 22:52:52 2015 UTC,"From Tacoma is about 50-60mins to Seattle. I ride from Puyallup every day. It takes 45 mins from there.  The orca card can be loaded or you can add a debit card to automatically add money to an epurse when needed from the orca website.  If you need more info on the card, visit the website. They even explain how to use it. Just don't try to swipe a paper ticket on the orca card reader."
Tacoma,3b17ni,albinobluesheep,2,Thu Jun 25 06:27:00 2015 UTC,I take the bus to Seattle ever day and have for over 15 years. If you commute early (before 7:30 or so) It takes about 50 minutes on average and is almost always faster than the train (which is NOT light rail- that's a different system). The exception is usually if there's an accident or a heavy storm during the winter. The bus's leave about every 5 minutes in the morning. Also if you stay late the train stops running at I think 6pm (not sure- you'll need to check) but the bus's run until 11:00pm. The train is slower because it makes so many stops ands runs through the Kent valley. From Puyallup it may be the same though since the bus drive from there is way different than from the Tacoma Dome.
Tacoma,3b17ni,albinobluesheep,2,Thu Jun 25 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Orca Cards you can either load up with cash when ever you want, or buy a monthly pass.  Monthly passes vary based on how much the max fare you want to use is (based on what your route is, you look at the most expensive leg of your trip if you're making any transfers). It only saves you enough money to be ""worth it"" if you use it 5 out of 7 days a week. Use it 3 or 4 times a week and you might break even, at which point loading it up manually is just a little inconvenient ever few weeks, but you don't have to worry about not getting your money's worth.  ex: if each trip you need $4, the pass is 144/month.  42(round trip)31(days)*(5/7)(weekdays/alldays) =~ $177, saving you $33 a month, but if you skip 3 or 4 days that month (get a ride from a friend, drive your self), you break even.  I personally have to drive into work every once in a while based on changing schedules, so I don't bother.   I wish it was a bigger discount, but w/e, it works for most people."
Tacoma,3b17ni,garbagedigits,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:13:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining the passes, probably not worth getting one in my case but good to know. Guess I'll just get an orca card."
Tacoma,3b17ni,Oksoda94,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:52:01 2015 UTC,"It's worth it to mention you register the ORCA card, and buy the pass online to associate with that ORCA card, so if you choose to get it later, you just update your payment options online."
Tacoma,3b17ni,CaryinTacoma,2,Thu Jun 25 22:51:48 2015 UTC,"I have used both the bus and train and prefer the latter.  A couple of items that have not been mentioned:   Bathrooms on the train; a deal breaker for some.  Depends on the strength of your bladder. The train is usually ready for boarding in Seattle up to 10 minutes before departure.  You get on and settle in.  Compare that to waiting at a bus stop in mid winter, crappy rain, the bus is running late...and you are huddled at the bus stop for 15 minutes.   When there are delays, train operators are much better about telling you what's what.  Often on a bus on I-5, you are slowing down for no reason you can see.  This give the train a psychological edge - I have a much better commute if I know why we are held up as opposed to being in the dark. Train has seats with tables, if you like to work on a laptop or otherwise work while commuting. Trains are rarely full, standing is usually by choice. I have never been on the train and had to stand; many times on the bus, I've stood in the aisle."

A difficult course, is a challenge, and how you handle a challenge is what really shows how good you are."

You'll see a big hill to climb. That eventually will turn into Dupont Road. A little while down take a right on Center. That will lead you to a little shopping area with some small shops if I recall. Then head back.  It's a low traffic route once you turn down Chambers Creek Rd, especially on weekend morning. Nice hill climbs as well. I think that's going to be roughly 28 miles."

Use Google Maps to create directions between two points, use the Bus mode. You can see how long each takes, how often that route comes around, etc etc. Example: https://goo.gl/maps/Vi3rt , then use Schedule Explorer to see alternate times, etc."
Tacoma,3agvuv,tehraven,3,Sat Jun 20 02:15:11 2015 UTC,"I am carless in Tacoma and Google Maps makes it easy to plan a route, buses are on time, and downtown up to the residential Proctor District and over towards central Tacoma near Tacoma Community College the buses are frequent and numerous. However when you try to get to University Place in the west and Lakewood to the south, which you will have to, the buses are far less numerous so the hour long gap between most bus routes becomes incredibly annoying. So basically if you are living in Tacoma proper and working in downtown or close to downtown, you'll do fine, the problem arises when you have to travel out of the way."
Tacoma,3agvuv,aidanrt,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"The buses here are pretty accessible but they stop running as often around 7 or 8 pm and can sometimes take an hour between buses even if it's just from Tacoma Dome Transit Center to the North End and I have also been frustrated when the buses are late sometimes even up to 20 min. Depending on where you are going, there are three or four buses that run directly to Seattle and back (Downtown and University District). The Link Rail system is free but it only stretches up and down downtown so can't exactly take you home and back unless you live in one of the downtown apartments (they plan to add stops in Hilltop and start charging next year). If you're looking to get to further locations such as Everett, the Sounder train is pretty convenient but goes out of the way towards towns out a bit easy like Puyallup and Sumner on its way north. The light rail in Seattle is fairly convenient and can take you from the corridor starting at SeaTac to I think almost Everett.  Overall doable but not the best transit I've ever experienced (not the most timely and there's no metro like the BART). My commute to Seattle takes just under two hours in the morning and just over two hours after work. Feel free to PM if you have any other questions."
Tacoma,3agvuv,Stereoisomer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:47:49 2015 UTC,The light rail in Seattle stops at 4th and Pike. I think they have a route further north planned and they're working on stops to the U district but for right now that's it.
Tacoma,3agvuv,lightjedi5,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:28:54 2015 UTC,As long as you live within a couple miles of the I-5 corridor you can get around on public transportation but you will have a hard time finding a job without a car.  Most employers expect you to have reliable transportation and they don't mean the bus.  The further north you live the less applicable this is but as far as Tacoma goes most people will need a car.  As for rent you might find a 2 bedroom in that price range but it's not going to be in a nice area and it's probably going to be either out in the boonies or run down.  You can get a 2 bedroom apartment for around that much but it's not going to be in a great neighborhood.
Tacoma,3agvuv,Maxtrt,2,Sat Jun 20 06:03:13 2015 UTC,"PSA unless your job directly requires and relates to the use of a car, or involves driving your own car as part of the job, employers are really really not supposed to ask questions about your method of transpo. Also, what? There are a ton of nice 2 bdrms for 8-1100. I pay fuckin 650 for a sparse but nice apartment in a clean nice area of hilltop.

If you want to get something dismissed you have to check the ""I didn't do it"" option then tell the judge your story and they can conditionally dismiss it if you have a clean driving record.   Basically they make you pay a court cost and it doesn't go on your record.   Keep in mind that State law only allows you to get one of these every 7 years.  Since Parking tickets don't go on your record I don't know if the same rules apply."

Tacoma,3agckd,CafeRoaster,2,Sat Jun 20 06:05:39 2015 UTC,"I got a ticket for not having a front license plate while parked in tacoma. Yes. That's a local ordinance. Anyway I contested, went to court dressed biz casual, judge asked me if the front plate is installed now, I replied yes, and he waived the ticket entirely. Saved 78$ I believe. I also parked illegally to go to court. By accident. But they did not take down my license plate correctly. So I tore that ticket up and was on my way!"
Tacoma,3agckd,fatprideworldwide,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"That's actually what mine is for! Moved here from a state that didn't have front plates, so when I registered the car I discovered the screws were rusted and I couldn't undo them myself to put on the plate. Got the ticket before I could get into a shop. Fingers crossed I have your same results!"

We were able to get figures on what electric and water cost and also if a house had a natural gas hookup or was near enough a line to run a hookup.  TPU gave us really good information during our search. Edit:  Sorry, PSE gave us the information on gas...TPU was water, sewer, electric, and trash."

Tacoma,3adbih,Oksoda94,3,Fri Jun 19 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"With TPU, you can set up what is called Budget Billing.  They take what you pay monthly over the course of the year and average it out so that you pay the same rate every month.  It takes a bit to get going but when it does, it's great.  For example, our bill is $175/month.  When we use less in utilities, it goes on a reserve.  When we use more, it pulls from the reserve.  They update it every 6 months I believe so if your usage is down, the average will lower.  *Edit:  We (2 of us) have a 100 year old craftsman that is 1700sqft with gas heat through PSE.  The summer bill from them is usually $15/month - mostly taxes.  Winter is roughly $45/month."

My internet is through Click, Tacoma's municipal broadband provider (good to support! Nudge nudge) through whichever ISP has the ladybug for the logo.  I have been very happy with Tacoma city and services, their customer service and all. Our place is a little smaller than yours.  TPU bills bi-monthly but i think ours was like 180/month in winter when a space heater was running more and like 90/month in summer of we don't water much.  Also when you move I'm if the previous owners leave a bunch of worthless junk in your place like ours did,  TPU has a program to pick up junk for free.

Tacoma,3adbih,AnonymousBeastXIII,2,Fri Jun 19 13:46:31 2015 UTC,"make sure your windows are UP TO DATE! We rented a house in hilltop. 3000 SQ ft 3 floors (2 floors/basement) with old style single pane windows. and our electric during the winter was 1000$ or so a month. What a god damned nightmare.  On average for a cost efficient home, electric is about 200$ or less, Water about 50$ give or take, Gas (unknown), Then garbage (if it's lakewood it's 70$ every 2 months). Houses aren't cheap, but they're worth it to be able  to do what you want with it.  The downside to owning instead of renting. if something breaks, busts, gets infested with (got only knows what, like bedbugs), you have to pay for it all yourself.  So do a little math...  Every 20 years (or so) roofs need to be done, (you need to save anywhere 10,000 to 50,000$  for a new roof), Every 5 years or so your house (outside) need paint (or power washed if siding and not paint)  300+$ for the job if you do it yourself.  There's plumbing expenses that accumulate if you don't take care of your plumbing.... keeping mold at bay by keeping the house a good temperature (too cold leads to dampness which in turn leads to mold). Mowing, and the weeding, fertilizing every 3 years (or more often depending on how much you like your yard).  Then there's fencing (if you want a dog or pet to have space to roam and the yard isn't fully fenced in)... i could go on and on.  Honestly though... home ownership rocks. I currently own a little trailer in a run down trailer park in lakewood. I'm not trying to be a deterent for you to own your own home, however, just realize the added cost of things. if you get a large enough home,  with more room than you need, you can always rent out the extra rooms to college kids for a little extra cash during the year. It will help offset some of the bills that will wrack up and help pad your pocket book for those ""whoops"" moments that we just can't plan for in home ownership.  Good luck and go for it!"

Not that there aren't indoor things to do, but many of the people who would be your social circle (and your kids' friends) will regularly want to do outdoors things.   I live in a very family-friendly neighborhood, but the houses are quite a bit older than your ""95 or newer"" requirement. Personally, I like older houses. I don't think you'll find what you're looking for in a house for $900. Maybe an apartment complex?"
Tacoma,3a7za0,missus_b,-2,Thu Jun 18 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure why I put it like that but our budget is more like <$1300 for a 3 bed. How much older are you talking I really don't want to have some creepy ass 1940's serial killer house and 60's-80's houses are just old enough to have everything breaking all the time and I am not a handy man with house stuff.   Edit: To the outdoorsy stuff if it's for the kids I am fine with it, I just put it in there because if it's there (like it sounds like here in Tacoma) great! But I don't care and it won't sway my mind. That may come from growing up in 100+ degree summers though...  Edit 2: That actually brings another question, what are summers like there are they hot and humid? I hate humidity."

My house was built in the 1920s and it is sturdy, cute and generally pretty awesome. We don't have things breaking all the time. If you only want shiny new homes, Tacoma is not for you.   Also, like I mentioned before, if you don't like being outside (and not just with your kids, I mean on a personal level), you may find it hard to make friends with like minded people here. Social activity typically consists of hiking, swimming, camping, etc. It's too beautiful here to waste time inside in front of a monitor.   Have you even been to the northwest before? You should not consider moving here until you've visited for at least a week. The people and the general vibe is very different.

The median age of a home in Puyallup is 24 years.  https://www.coldwellbanker.com/real_estate/home_search/WA/Pierce+County/puyallup  While the median age of a house in Tacoma is 41 years.  https://www.coldwellbanker.com/real_estate/home_search/WA/Pierce+County/tacoma  And in some neighborhoods (I live in proctor) the median age is closer to 80 years.  My house is 88 years old, and I love it... No cookie cutter ticky tacky for me..."

Tacoma,3a7jef,_Spaget_,2,Wed Jun 17 21:05:15 2015 UTC,"I moved here from Tucson in 1997. If you are use to living on $16/hr there in AZ, then you should honestly look for something around $18 here. Its about 10-20% more expensive here than in AZ. One thing you will definitely save on though is electricity. No AC here! The lay of the land is similar here (grid layouts of streets). The people are 100 times nicer in Tacoma than Seattle or anywhere in AZ (IMO). I am southern and missed that living in AZ. Seattle is very pricey. I have lived in Tacoma, Gig Harbor and Federal Way. All are great places. Tacoma is ideal though if you are in the 20-30 age group.   Some pointers that I learned when moving: 1. Look for apartments mid-month. People move out on the last of the month and they are easier to find mid month after they are cleaned and prepped. Some even waive deposits to fill them before the 1st.    Pack light. Tons of great cheap finds on craigslist to replace what you don't bring.  More jobs will be available towards August as the college kids return to school.    I would not get a long lease right away, possibly look for roommate situation until you know the area better!  Look to CL for jobs. I owned a business and pretty much used that and no other way of posting when I had openings.   Hope this helps!"

Tacoma,39xsqz,T1978_sach,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:58:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, a question I can answer!  I've been part of both gyms. Currently at CT. Here's the breakdown:  Pros: Edgeworks has better technical routes and endurance routes. Really good when you're top roping, lead practice, and beta intensive bouldering routes.  Cons: Edgeworks has a lot of new folks cycling in and out, lots of kids that go around, and can get very crowded. Ironically, I've found the people at edgeworks to be a little more group oriented, so it's harder to break in. It is also more expensive. Also, since it's more top rope focus, I feel like routes stay stagnant for much longer.  CT Pro: Bouldering gym. New routes every week on a different wall. People are very chill and its easy to make friends at CT. Moves are much more dynamic. Less expensive.  CT Con: Less beta intensive. Their routes have been getting a lot better, and so there's a good balance, I think, of routes that are muscle-y or things that are more technical. Harder grades.   I think it's free with a member the first time, so if you want to come check out CT, pm me."

Within about 45 seconds of being inside I truly realized how much that place sucks.  There were kids crying, these weird bells and sounds going off every few seconds, people yelling about their orders, awful smells, and all the employees had to wear dumb uniforms and headsets.  Look.  At that moment I realized how much that job sucks, and probably fast food in general.  Those people work hard and do a lot of crap that people like you and me would probably suck at and or not even have he patience to put up with.  It's easy to say they should ""apply themselves"" or ""get a real job"" but sometimes it's not that easy.  Everyone has a story and no two lives are the same.  It'd be nice if more people could get away from this selfish outlook on life and maybe have some compassion for humans in general.  My point is, low paying jobs are generally shitty ones that nobody else wants.  And 9/10 times they should definitely pay more money.  Nobody is going to walk away from their nursing career, or engineering job because they can now make $15 to work at McDonalds.  Someone who's considering going to a university to become a lawyer isn't going to now go, ""well, why's should I do that when I can deep fry food for 8 hours a day, every day, for the rest of my life.""  It won't change the fact that it's a crappy job, it'll just make life a little less bleak for these workers who, for whatever reason, work these jobs.  *Edit:  I used to work a job where I made $16/hr but didn't have any benefits.  When I went to the dentist, I paid out of pocket.  When I went to the doctor, I paid out of pocket.  I was broke.  So $15/hr still isn't much without benefits."

Get a minimum wage job, get another while you're still working, continue this. build a decent resume, shoot higher. if you work hard at your jobs, you can be certain your employer will recommend you to get that better job. If not, you have plenty of tries to get there.

Tacoma,39dzdw,Jomann,2,Fri Jun 12 18:46:52 2015 UTC,"That's not the issue, the issue is more about income inequality. huge companies rely on minimum wage workers who are disposable, there's a never ending string of underpriveleged people who were born into bad situations or with issues that cannot be magically fixed (ie: handicaps) and many minorities fall prey to this cycle as well. Raising the minimum wage will alleviate some of those pressures in areas where it's EXTREMELY hard for them to rise above their circumstances."

Tacoma,39dzdw,TitanReign25389,0,Sun Jun 14 09:42:44 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with it at all, but a better world doesn't start with inflating our economy. like raising the minimum always does, its a temporary fix to a permanent problem. These days it's not people that are holding a bunch of money, its government. And that is because liberals keep pushing for a bigger government. If you wanna know who the real consolidators of wealth are, look no farther than our politicians. Big Business spends its money plenty, so much so that companies are going out of business and switching hands like never before, and the reason? Government businesses. They can never fail. But besides that, It's your right to consolidate your wealth as you see fit. There is no easy answer. it's gonna come down to being active and possibly even reforming our government."

Make sure when you are applying for jobs that you are including in your resume relevant keywords and skills that relate to the job description. For example, even if you are applying to a job that you don't have relevant experience for, you can still use online tools to find out what skills you should put in your prior experience to make sure you make it past the resume screening programs companies use to screen applicants. You only typically get selected if your resume match percentage is 80% and above. By tailoring your resume and using the tool, you're more likely to get an interview!

What little commercial traffic there is between Tacoma and Olympia is over a mile away through the main South Sound channel. It's way too shallow otherwise. Now there may be quite a bit more small boat traffic but no worse than any other event.   The only reason they are blocking it is to deny public access to the beach area during their event. I can even understand them not wanting people to beach their kayaks but 1000 yards is a huge distance and completely out of line. That is a PUBLIC beach and the waters around it are intended for the use of all.

Aside from the money issues, this doesn't even account for the loss of use to a several miles of public trails and parks that started back in MARCH!  Also these many of facilities will remain off limits until September! WTH, I can't even imagine what would take 3 months to break down and remove from the Chambers Bay parks that would necessitate them remaining closed. My suspicion is that they really want to wean people away from using this PUBLIC facilities so that they can begin to deny access in advance of the new Hotel and second golf course that they are planning down there now.

The million dollars will be divvied up between Pierce County, Tacoma and Lakewood. The state of WA will also pay quite a bit and I believe that even Seattle is chipping in some. The point I was trying to make is that Public money and facilities are being taken for the benefit of very few. The slight increases in tax receipts ( for many of the small communities especially) don't come close to outweighing the costs to the communities in terms of money paid out or in loss of very popular public facilities. I somehow doubt that the billionaires and multi millionaires really need us to pay for their recreation, but if we are offering it for (very nearly) free then who could blame them."

The reason you don't have any friends is that you probably blame everything on your supposed trans identity, when in reality, at least from what i can gather by your posts, you're an antisocial douche.

Get over it dude. honestly I can't figure out how to block you but with any luck I will before you have a chance to reply to this... See a shrink, find a friend to discuss your personality flaws with, anything other using the action of spewing garbage at someone you don't know on the internet would be much more healthy.

However, there's a sentiment that he's  ""unelectable"" and Hillary is ""inevitable"" so we might as well vote for her. I think that's a wrong way to think. You should vote for what you like, not what you think will win. If everyone voted for what they like, then Bernie will win for sure."
Tacoma,38r0l7,SpaceNavy,2,Sat Jun 6 19:11:31 2015 UTC,Most people who say things like that are shills for Hillary.  More polls are coming out that show Bernie gaining more and more of her followers.

It's not exactly the same as at the meat and three cafeteria, but I honestly think Paula Deen's recipe with the pepoeeidge farms Chessman cookies is by far the best if you are willing to take a simple country recipe and go upscale with it a bit. Substitute real whipped cream for the cool whip because yuck.   To make any of those candies, you are going to have to come up with an alcohol based tincture. I'm planning on making one soon. I've heard that the original Cheeba recipe was simply melted actual tootsie rolls with tincture mixed in to a specific potency. As a former analytical chemist in the pharmaceutical industry, this is exactly how I would have done it."

None of the articles I saw (and there weren't many) mentioned what she did to receive the punishment in the first place, so the rest is just hearsay and speculation."

This girl is a victim, a victim of he father, a victim of these supposed over-aged men, and now she is your victim after death.  Have you no shame?  I have a daughter not much younger than this. I realize going into her 'tween and teen years that I will not be able to control every aspect of her life. The only influence I can possibly have to affect positive change in her life is for myself to be a positive role model as to how she sees men.  I think her father's actions leave no doubt that it was him, his poor excuse as a father figure and a man, his viscous and vindictive nature, that both led to her poor choices with men and ultimately taking he own life.  I can't legally make a case for a crime, as I am not a lawyer. I can't wish him to the deepest bowels of hell, as I am not religious. I can only hope that he realizes at some point what he did to his beautiful little girl and suffers the agony he so sorely deserves."

The idea that she is doing this so young can only point to more failures of the father as a role model. That is the only true control that we have over our children, that we can set an example of what a man is supposed to be. Young women look for men who resemble us. If she chose a scumbag who would take advantage of a child, then her dad is most likely a scumbag also.  His actions after the fact just confirm this beyond any doubt.   He is not a man."

Humiliating your kids is beyond comprehension to me. Learn how to discipline, and how to teach your kids right from wrong. Use your words and experience as an adult, don't take the easy way out. The current trend of public shaming sickens me. Man the fuck up and teach your kids why their behavior needs adjusting. Don't scare them into submission. You're a family, not a tyrant.  Also, I think your downvoters are missing the point by discounting one thing you said about normal behavior. Everything else is spot on. I guess the disagree button is in full force, per usual."

Just to be clear about the ""over-aged man"" reference, people who know the family are saying THAT is what this was all about. It wasn't just that she was drinking or doing drugs, it's that she was with an adult man. ""Drinking and drugging"" may just be a euphemism, it may not even have happened. This is so obviously about the father's ego and perverse sense of honor, so he probably is resistant to even acknowledge what he was upset about.  If it wasn't about his ego and pride than he would be filing a police report about the real offender, a man who probably raped his child. Yet, he punished the victim.  I'm not excusing her actions, I'm just pointing to the actual criminals, both men."

Tacoma,38jedq,111Jesuslovesme,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:16:49 2015 UTC,"You can't just casually dismiss the issue of whether or not she was already mentally ill, depressed, etc beforehand; it's the core of your portrayal of the daughter as the innocent victim who never did anything even remotely wrong in any way in her whole life, and the  father as the evil, abusive sadist who is not just indirectly at fault, but personally and gleefully coached her to end her life.   Nowhere did I say that the dad did everything right; all I've done is neglect to join your literally mindless witch hunt."
Tacoma,38jedq,Soldier4Christ82,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:32:48 2015 UTC,"Let me add my 2 cents here. If you really believe that it's OK for a father to shave his daughter's head as a form of punishment, then I agree:  please don't ever have children.  That is absolutely abusive, and if you don't see that, then you should move to Saudi Arabia so you can live amongst the rest of your kind."
Tacoma,38jedq,Styles4040,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"He's her father, not me, so I'm not about to join in your psychotic lynch mob over something as trivial as cutting her hair. If you're ready to attack a complete stranger over cutting his daughter's hair then I have news for you; you're the one who shouldn't be having children, and that's completely overlooking the fact that you want all parents who don't handle things in perfect unison with the way you do to be removed from this country."
Tacoma,38jedq,Soldier4Christ82,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"Basically I was taking the child's suicide out of the equation and was just directing my comment towards the father's actions.  Why would you ever consider it OK for ANY reason for a father to whack off his daughter's hair as a form of punishment?  That's not good parenting!  What purpose does that serve?  What lesson does that teach?  Traumatizing, humiliating and emotionally scarring a young girl by chopping off her hair is abusive.  Period.  And I didn't even address the daughter's behavior whatsoever in my comment, so your fantastical accusations which you're attributing to me simply don't apply."
Tacoma,38jedq,Styles4040,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"I may disagree with chopping the hair off, but it's not my place to say that it's wrong because she's not my child, nor is it yours; the difference is that I acknowledge the fact that it's not and that I don't actually know the whole story any more than you do,  whereas you dearly love to make believe that you have the authority and the right to try to dictate to complete strangers how to and not to discipline their child.   Is it traumatizing to take a game console away then, if something so comparably trivial to any actual abuse is so outrageously offensive to you? Maybe we should start giving parents the death penalty for disciplining their child in any way, shape or form whatsoever, so that they never have to worry about being ""emotionally scarred"" by even the most basic level of discipline."
Tacoma,38jedq,Soldier4Christ82,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:24:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, it IS your place to say it's wrong ... even though she isn't your child.  When you witness outright abuse like this, then it becomes your responsibility to speak out and defend the victim.  Children are NOT property.  They aren't like cattle that can be bought and sold and treated any way the owner wishes to treat them because he ""owns"" them.  There isn't even a ""fine line"" here: chopping off a woman's hair isn't an act of discipline, it's an act of abuse designed to instill humiliation and shame. It's not the same as taking a kid's game console away, or putting them in time out in the corner or cutting off their allowance.  It's FAR more severe!  Put it this way: let's say you infuriate your father by staying out too late with your friends, so he shaves your head and then tattoos 666 onto your scalp and parades you around town telling everyone you love the devil.  Would you consider that a normal, effective form of discipline?  When a parent is trying to instill good values in a child and there comes a time when disciplinary actions are in order, it's not about tearing down and breaking the child's spirit through excessive force, humiliation and domination ... it's about giving them loving guidance and sometimes appropriate consequences to reinforce the difference between right and wrong."

It's going up as soon as I move out and to Tacoma at the end of the month, but I know plenty of other people that got lucky and found similar rent situations around. That said, if you have Tacoma picked out, then I think some other people here might be better qualified to answer since I just started researching that myself. We aimed for 6th Ave and got a house just about 2 blocks off, but there are some other really cool areas around. I would check out http://www.movetotacoma.com/ for some quick info on neighborhoods. There are a few recent threads on here about Hilltop, which I'm guessing will come up at some point in your search.  As for surrounding areas, I actually grew up in Fife and NE Tacoma, so I can speak a bit for them if you'd like to know anything specific.   Good luck!"
Tacoma,38ii32,Brandomin,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:42:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Some of the areas that I was focusing my search in were the stadium district in Tacoma, Fife and Federal Way like I mentioned.  Can you speak about Fife in terms of how safe it is (I have read it is a very nice area) and any apartment complexes you are familiar with in that area that you or friends might have had good experiences with.  Also about the community makeup and whether folks commute up to Seattle and what method they use.    When you get a chance this info would be helpful.  Thanks."
Tacoma,38ii32,Brandomin,2,Fri Jun 5 18:39:18 2015 UTC,"Fife is pretty safe to my knowledge -- not immune to random violence or theft here and there, but certainly it's a safe place to walk around/run/live/go to school. I had family live in three apartment complexes close to the high school and it seemed about as rowdy as a place like Fife could possibly get, which isn't really much (the names escape me, but there are only so many).  I know that you have the Puyallup and Tacoma stops for the Sounder and 2 places to get onto I-5 should you choose to drive.  Honestly, I would say it's a fine place to grow up but not a great place to move to in your late 20s to early 30s unless it's to find a quiet and affordable housing with space to spare. If it's a social scene you're going for, it's very residential and car-dependent.  The school district is solid. Lots of teachers are still there from over 10 years ago, which is a good sign. The technicalities of food deserts escape me, but I think it might be one. Lots of car dealerships, gas stations, and fast food, but not a lot of ""third space"" options, really."
Tacoma,38ii32,Blackg0ld,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:58:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  Fife seems similar to where I am living in Connecticut.  Are you familiar with the Federal Way area?  Thanks again.

Tacoma,38ii32,YarnStache,2,Sun Jun 7 04:25:08 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar situation to yourself. I work in Seattle and live in Tacoma. The sounder is a solid choice, but you might also consider the bus line. For my route, it's faster than the sounder since the bus takes the hov lane all the way. I live in north end at an apartment that's well within your price range. The maples and bay ridge apartments are both near local bus lines that take you everywhere in Tacoma (one short ride away from inter-city transit), and within walking distance to groceries, etc. North end is really great. As a woman, I feel quite safe walking around by myself at night. Not to mention, it's beautiful. So many cool historic houses and lush gardens. Let me know if there's anything else you wanted to know."

Tacoma,38ii32,YarnStache,2,Fri Jun 5 19:57:50 2015 UTC,"I think that stadium district might be a little more expensive to live in, but it's also a really nice part of town. It's where the shops are that I frequent from the north end. Grocery store, coffee, dry cleaners, pharmacy, etc. Walkable, good transit, safe, pretty, quiet. You could even walk to the transit center pretty easily and get straight on a Seattle bus. The link is a free (for now) trolley car that goes to the Tacoma dome station where you can get on the sounder."

Their onion tanglers are great too).  Warthog isn't very good. Super soggy meat (and thus soggy buns), really ketchup-y bbq sauce. Hated it the first time, decided to give it a second chance and hated it again.  Smokin Zees - I was really looking forward to it and drove 20 minutes to get it during rush hour on a Friday. Got home and was sadly disappointed. Mac & Cheese was bland, the bbq sauce basically tasted like straight ketchup, and the meat was just way too wet.  Really, there's just no fantastic bbq in Tacoma. If you're up for a bit of a drive, RoRo's in Fremont is solid and The Wood Shop food truck is often in Seattle and is also solid.

Tacoma,38d93t,drinkNfight,3,Wed Jun 3 17:06:42 2015 UTC,"I was at the one in Parkland about 2 weeks ago and was pretty disappointed.   They had a chalk board at the front counter advertising fresh lemonade and a special with mac & cheese. I ordered both, and was informed that the lemonade was just the cheapy usual kind out of the soda fountain, and that they were also out of mac & cheese.  I changed my order to a combo platter, and when it came out, the ribs had more fat and gristle than meat, and the chicken was quite dry. I will give them points for the brisket, as the brisket was fantastic.  My sides were beans and potato salad, the beans were good (slightly spicy, which is fine with me), and the potato salad was just the kind bought at Walmart in a carton, so can't really comment more than that. I also got a cold cornbread muffin, which was totally average, so, not bad.  TL;DR If you go to Warthog, I would suggest you stick with the brisket."

They estimated that less than $600,000 in revenue will be generated from the event for local businesses (UP and Lakewood- not Seattle) and yet the US Open essentially pays nothing to have the public host it. They have closed our public trails and playgrounds for months (with months remaining of closures-AFTER the event closes) This includes a multi million dollar bridge over the train tracks that just opened and allows access to miles of otherwise unused public beaches. You can bet that when more events are hosted and a new hotel at Chambers bay is built the rich won't  want all of the unwashed public walking on their beachfront either."
Tacoma,38b2ul,ces614,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"Well put except that the USGA does more than pay nothing - it pays nothing AND reaps millions from the gate, souvenirs, and the broadcast. The USGA is a fine organization but it doesn't need Pierce County to transfer millions of tax dollars to it.  County has also backed away from any hope of making any money from the tourney, and the county executive has her fingers crossed just to break even. Still not enough cops, the county is going in the red on this tourney just on security alone. The USGA isn't picking up the tab.  This is like the recent FIFA soap opera, except substitute incompetence and naivete on the county's behalf for corruption of FIFA kleptocrats."
Tacoma,38b2ul,ces614,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:00:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I suspected as much. No one has even mentioned that the course itself has been losing money every year since it opened and the public has been picking up the tab for that as well. My wife asked around about what public meetings took place and it turns out that public comment had been carefully managed (in UP at least) by moving meetings around, cancelling them unexpectedly and by only putting notice in the Lakewood paper (for UP meetings!). I think Golf is great and I'm glad the we have a world class course. I'm even glad that the event is here, I just don't think that billionaires need our little community to pick up the tab for them!"
Tacoma,388jb9,fieldofturby,16,Tue Jun 2 16:38:28 2015 UTC,Cutting off all of a girls hair is beyond public shaming.   There's probably a history of abuse before this video.   This person is disgusting.

Tacoma,388jb9,Anal_ProbeGT,-8,Tue Jun 2 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"""Their"" is a pronoun that doesn't agree with ""a person."" Author should have used ""her"" instead of ""their."""

Tacoma,388jb9,a_savoir,-7,Tue Jun 2 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"Chicago Manual of Style cautions:   A singular antecedent requires a singular referent pronoun. Because he is no longer accepted as a generic pronoun referring to a person of either sex, it has become common in speech and in informal writing to substitute the third-person plural pronouns they, them, their, and themselves, and the nonstandard singular themself. While this usage is accepted in casual context, it is still considered ungrammatical in formal writing.   It's sloppy to use ""they,"" especially when the subject of the article is female. Lots of other style guides provide the same advice. I would be curious to see your source of Strunk & White on this matter - their initial advice was to not worry about using the masculine pronoun, which one of the two later revised. After revision, I don't think that the advice became ""use 'they' for 'he',"" but to avoid an emphasis on the masculine."

You are correct in your assessment of the atrocious grammar in this piece but there is a better place for it. Grammar shaming will not bring her back to life.
Tacoma,388jb9,TacomaLove,-17,Tue Jun 2 21:06:10 2015 UTC,"My daughter is friends with many kids from giodrone. Her name was Isabelle and she posted pictures on Facebook with her in a sports bra. She also had men over 18 on her friends list and was having inappropriate conversations with them. The father found out she snuck out of the house and got drunk with one of the over aged men.   I am not saying what the father did was right but I do believe that the girl should have been punished.   Obviously there is something more going on in the house for a 12 year old girl seeking sexual attention.  My daughter is the same age and she just had her first kiss on valentine's day from her boyfriend of 5 months.  Before you all get out the pitchforks remember that the girl had some sort of issues.  Suicide is not the first option when getting your hair forcefully cut.  I cut 26"" off my hair as lice was becoming an every 3 month event. Never once did I harbor ill feelings much less suicidal thoughts.  She needed help. It was the failure of her parents and school that these signs were not recognized. Most likely the signs could have been seen in behavior or grades."
Tacoma,388jb9,mclassy3,9,Tue Jun 2 17:24:31 2015 UTC,How does the part about your lice infested head have any relevance to a 12 year who's head was forcibly shaved then posted online as a form of public shaming?
Tacoma,388jb9,marijuanaperson,11,Tue Jun 2 21:26:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, that kind of risky behavior absolutely needs to be addressed.  I understand what you're saying, but the haircuts you had and the haircut forced on this girl are in no way comparable. Was it humiliating? If so, did your father videotape you and share your humiliation with all your peers?    There are a million ways to help a child without ripping away their already fragile developing social identity and shaming them in front of the world.  That's cruelty, and the video is indicative of far larger problems in that house.  I don't think the haircut was the cause of her wanting to take her own life.  I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back."
Tacoma,388jb9,Miett,7,Tue Jun 2 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"The girl had obviously been groomed sexually. So, no, I don't think she should have been punished. Gotten help? Yes. Possibly separated from her father? Yes. Her actions were from long term abuse from someone she interacted with in the home."
Tacoma,388jb9,ihaveapentax,13,Tue Jun 2 19:39:07 2015 UTC,"I find your ridiculous line of logic incredibly offensive. This girl is a victim, a victim of he father, a victim of these supposed over-aged men, and now she is your victim after death.   Have you no shame?  I have a daughter not much younger than this. I realize going into her 'tween and teen years that I will not be able to control every aspect of her life. The only influence I can possibly have to affect positive change in her life is for myself to be a positive role model as to how she sees men.  I think her father's actions leave no doubt that it was him, his poor excuse as a father figure and a man, his viscous and vindictive nature, that both led to her poor choices with men and ultimately taking he own life.   I can't legally make a case for a crime, as I am not a lawyer. I can't wish him to the deepest bowels of hell, as I am not religious. I can only hope that he realizes at some point what he did to his beautiful little girl and suffers the agony he so sorely deserves."

Tacoma,385x2k,danhm,7,Tue Jun 2 16:05:16 2015 UTC,"Cool. Wave has a 300GB/month cap, which is ridiculously small."
Tacoma,385x2k,quengilar,3,Tue Jun 2 07:35:04 2015 UTC,"Not trying to start anything, just clarifying, Click! also has a data cap ranging from 250GB to 600GB depending on your package.     Excessive use means bandwidth or data usage that is significantly higher than typical usage for which our network is designed. Excessive Users consume so much data that their usage could negatively impact the Service provided to other customers. In order to ensure an optimized Internet experience for all Users, data guidelines have been assigned to all Internet services, and are subject to change.     https://www.rainierconnect.com/click-network-internet-acceptable-use-policy    That said, in my experience, they don't enforce it if it isn't a common occurrence."
Tacoma,385x2k,danhm,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:30:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Wave's 300 GB is the largest cap, maybe even the only option if I remember correctly. I can live with the 500 GB cap I have from Net-Venture/Click (Net-Venture tells me it is Click, not them, enforcing it) but would certainly prefer not to."
Tacoma,385x2k,a_savoir,2,Wed Jun 3 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"Caps are such a scam. The FCC's recent omnibus ruling failed to address that and it is, arguably, a more important regulatory point than a large portion of the side rulings.  With increased consolidation we'll be here again in ten years. I know why, but I think the commission erred in not addressing this."
Tacoma,385x2k,rhein1969,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"As a customer in Port Orchard, where are you getting this? The highest cap is 1 TB.   http://www.wavebroadband.com/for-home/internet/packages/  Honestly, when wave started, the sucked. But after the recent round of upgrades, and the 1TB cap, I can say I would rather stay with Wave than go with someone like Comcast."
Tacoma,385x2k,253IsHome,3,Sun Jun 7 07:16:02 2015 UTC,"Rainier Connect is already one of the three ISPs offering Click! First and foremost, I see this as a bid to consolidate and push NetVenture and AdancedStream out of the market -- so much for competition. Right out of the gate it reeks of conflict of interest just on principle.  Secondly, I personally loathe Rainier Connect, having grown up in their POTS coverage area, and experiencing first hand for decades their anti-customer service and amazingly terrible infrastructure in areas where they actually own the POTS lines (Eatonville), granting them a monopoly and the luxury of just being all-around awful at everything. They would have folded 20 years ago if they had ever been up against any competition at all.  I can only see the same thing happening with a guaranteed seat at the Click! helm for decades. I can easily see the entire scenario flipping from the familiar, vaunted scrappy-city-keeps-Comcast-behemoth-in-check to Comcast being the only thing keeping Mashell TelecomRainier Connect grounded in their little playground.  Thirdly, everything else probably doesn't matter so much as the economics big picture just not looking rosy regardless of how you cut it. Tacoma Power wanted to go it alone with their infrastructure build-out, fine. But they don't, and can't, and never will have the scale to keep up with infrastructure upgrades and technology advances against their nearest competitor. It's already beginning to show in the differences in generations of cable modems, aggregate data channels and maximum speeds between Click! and Comcast, and I don't see any reason why that gap isn't only going to get wider. This ultimately relegates Click! to even more of the homegrown cut-rate rough-edged discount niche market. Certain segments of residential would probably continue to consume that idea as a good thing, but businesses (where the money is) won't tolerate it. They already have technological shortcomings in that area, and in the local professional technology and upmarket services sector are regarded as something of a joke.  Those of us in IT have seen that the honeymoon is over and the writing on the wall for years."

Tacoma,385gfm,ShadowmansShadow,8,Tue Jun 2 03:47:25 2015 UTC,"Edibles are something of a tourist trap at the moment.  Ridiculously priced for the most part.  12 dollar cookies.  You can get some Zoots Rocks that are about the just about one of the best deals when it comes to edibles.  20 little lozenges you stick under your tongue and suck on at 5mg of THC a piece and 40 bucks a tin.  Works out to about 2 bucks a lozenge, but it's a much better deal than cookies or brownies or sodas.  Also the 5mg lozenges make it pretty easy to dose yourself without going over.  They're easily split with a pill cutter so you can work up in 2.5mg increments and find a dose that works for you.    Just be sure that whenever you have some, you stick it out for at least an hour before having more.  It can take a while to kick in and you wouldn't want to go over where you're comfortable.  Take it slow and experiment, work up to a good dose."

Tacoma,385gfm,model06,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"That's why I said generally. But this is someone that hasn't smoked for decades. Newbies tend to not know that edibles tend to be more powerful (or that it takes longer to kick in) and eat too much and in turn have a really bad night. Then could swear it off across the board due to that one bad night. I've smoked for about 2 decades as well and have had a few occurences like what you had, it just wasn't the norm in my experience. Completely agree w you on the insane pricing around here on em! The few times I've had some that didn't do much of anything were from rec stores.

Tacoma,37zync,HealthySelfie,7,Mon Jun 1 01:31:58 2015 UTC,"Tacoma Cabana is an authentic tiki bar on Pacific at 9th. They serve custom hand crafted cocktails and amazing food. It's not your run of the mill bar... You won't find Bud Lite or pina coladas here. Every juice is fresh squeezed, no concentrate - and they have over 300 different rums to try. It's themed out very well, island music in the background, and the tv only plays episodes of Gilligan's Island. All of their food is fresh prepared and carries an island theme. Ask Jason (the bartender/owner for a Zombie - and then try a pupu platter, coffee rubbed steak, or the chips and guacamole.  The Mix is more of a lounge and social place. It's very gay friendly, but a lot of straight people go there as well - it's a ""mix"". They have a pool table and do karaoke as well. Strong drinks, good beers on tap. Lots of friendly people there in a comfortable atmosphere. I think Randy is still the manager, really nice guy that'll talk your ear off. Staff is really friendly as well.  Also, check out Tacoma Red Hot on 6th - they have amazing hot dogs (try the Hosmer Hound Dog, you won't regret it). They've got all rotating taps, maybe 40 of them and get amazing one off kegs of beer that you can't get anywhere else. Younger crowd, kind of a decent mix of people, kind of hip, but still a cool environment. I believe Stu is still the owner - big friendly guy. Oh, the Frito pie is delicious.  Hank's Corner Bar is close to you too... Very much an industry place. Cold beer, decent pub grub. Dart boards and pool tables. Seth will be your dude there.  Hope that helps!"

Portland, OR is still on the table too, our only concern is the state taxes and I don't know if it's a young crowd or our age or even the atmosphere.  The cost of living in Seattle has gotten outrageous, and we can't justify moving there to spend all of our money on a place to live."

Tacoma,37zzph,SeahawksClippersBro,1 point,Sun May 31 21:08:25 2015 UTC,"u/strangermouse is right. Having no income tax and a comparatively high sales tax makes this economic environment better for the rich and worse for the poor. No need to get hostile about it, it's the truth.  You can find any number of articles to back it up:  Forbes  USA Today  Seattle Times  Washington Post"
Tacoma,37zzph,meglski,2,Sun May 31 22:01:18 2015 UTC,"Go read the PDF for yourself and don't rely on journalists to properly interpret and convey the information contained in the report.  http://www.itep.org/pdf/whopaysreport.pdf  The ITEP report focuses almost exclusively on sales and excise taxes (regressive by default) while selectively ignoring property and income taxes (neither regressive nor progressive by default). It also includes corporate tax in a report focused on personal tax rates. Including state EITC is laughable seeing as how less than half of the country has implemented it in a working fashion, and it is merely a bonus on top of federal EITC - which would be nice in highly regressive sales/excise tax states, but which shouldn't be considered a standard by which to judge. The focus on statewide averages do a disservice to the individual taxpayer but does make for great policy wonk material; a better Texas to Washington comparison would be Austin v. Seattle, Brownwood v. Spokane, Comanche v. Walla Walla.  I like ITEP, but like any other think tank they have an agenda (e.g. anti-sales and excise tax). I can agree with anti-regressive tax sentiment, but their methodology leaves too much room for criticism from right-leaning think tanks.  I'd rather pay taxes in Washington than Texas or Illinois, but I'd rather have Texas or Illinois cost of living. Being poor in Washington sucks, but we're really splitting hairs when we call a percent of a percent difference in one facet of tax policy better or worse. We're also cherrypicking when we fail to include property taxes, which, as we discovered during the great recession, are only loosely tied to actual income/earning potential."

Tacoma,37ml83,glynnjamin,-4,Thu May 28 20:42:49 2015 UTC,This is correct. The problem is that you have to watch the video about how they euthanize all the animals as part of the orientation.  You will hate yourself and become the person who lashes out at people who dont spay/neuter their pets or buy from shops/breeders.
Tacoma,37ml83,ihaveapentax,7,Thu May 28 21:21:16 2015 UTC,Um... I don't recall that from my orientation 6 months ago.

I heard a train snagged a cable hanging from the bridge and might have left it structurally unsound. Repairs are taking a long time. I'll check tomorrow to see if things have changed. Alternatively, you can park by the ferry docks and walk the track around to that section of beach. It wouldn't take more than 10 min. Or you could just move over to sunny side or the bluff by ER Rodgers. There are plenty of scenic spots over in Steilacoom."

Tacoma,37eecp,Joeness84,15,Wed May 27 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"It is a neighborhood in Tacoma that has had a bad reputation due to a rough past, but is not as bad as people think it is, and has a lot of potential that is only beginning to be realized. You may still encounter people that are stuck in the past and tell you that it is the most dangerous place in the world. It is not.  There is a growing number of pretty damn good bars and restaurants in the neighborhood, and there is a community center (People's) that has a brand new pool going in. The hospitals are centered in Hilltop and provide a significant source of employment.  The Link light rail is currently in planning stages to be extended into the neighborhood in the next few years, hopefully spurring additional improvements. As of right now, the bus system is adequate. You can get to the downtown core, 6th Ave for more bars/restaurants, or get to the regional bus/train station at the Tacoma Dome fairly easily."

Peterson Bros makes some bomb ass sandwiches. Hilltop Kitchen and 1022 South J are super rad bars, both of them specializing in cocktails.  And I would avoid the Safeway. One time, I was in the parking lot and had a dude in a tweed jacket walk up to my car, stick his head in my car and whisper, ""Interested in half-price steaks? Steaks at half price?"" Freaked me out and haven't been back since."
Tacoma,37eecp,notnotnotryan,2,Wed May 27 00:56:38 2015 UTC,Wouldn't Safeway be the one place that actually belongs to the neighborhood rather than a bar or two frequented by people traveling form elsewhere? Doesn't seem like a vote for Hilltop if you're not a fan of the actual neighborhood itself

There was a big (legitimate) stink made a few years back how all these other Safeways in the area were getting huge renovations (University Place and a few others) yet, the one that needed it most (on Hiilltop) was left as is. It's extremely small and old school in a not-so-good way. It also closes really early every night at around 10pm if memory serves. Not the norm for grocery stores. And it does tend to have some interesting situations in the parking lot. Just mind your own business and you'll be fine. There are some other grocery stores that are fairly close, but tend to be overpriced in comparison. See: Stadium Thriftway, The Met, and I think there's a new store on Pacific as well? I personally like the Safeway across from the Met. They have good prices and tend to have much different stock than other Safeways in the area in order to compete with the Met."

The National Register of Historic Places (US Department of the Interior)specifies the geographic area of Hilltop as located within the City of Tacoma and bounded on the east by Tacoma Avenue South, on the north by Division Street, on the west by Sprague Avenue, and on the south by the edge of the bluff, which roughly equates to South 27th Street(1). Hilltop derives its name from its location on a high bluff overlooking Commencement Bay and the Port of Tacoma.  Hilltop is near the historic Tacoma Public Library main branch, Bates Technical College, the Pierce County Courthouse, and the new Pierce County Correctional Facility, all of which are located on Hilltop's east side. It is adjoined by Tacoma's more affluent Stadium District.

I don't feel too far from anything, and I can easily get downtown where some nice destinations or transit to other areas are located.  My friends and I know almost a dozen people our age (late 20s, early 30s) who just purchased homes in this area.  I think it is on the up and up, and I'm curious to see what light rail brings.

Word kinda spread like wildfire that he was there. I remember people starting to notice when a mom had sent her toddler over to wave at him, and he gave one of those cute waves you see Disney Princesses give at Disneyland.  When more people started coming to the food court, they figured news spread and got up. He walked by our table. I said ""Hi"" and he gave a quick look and nod and said ""Hi"", and kept walking.  Then he went into the shoe store that was next where rite aid used to be, and mall security showed up, and would not let anyone else in the store after he went in. This one person had gone into the Rite Aid and bought a camera for obvious intentions, and one of the MSG's said that camera's weren't allowed in the mall, and the person was like ""I bought it in the mall, right there...""....I can only imagine what they could say now since everyone has a camera on them.  Everyone then followed him down to another shoe store (Footlocker? I can't remember, it's been 15 years. It was/is by Claire's), and then to the exit by Journey's and Auntie Anne's. We saw him and his security get into a limo, and then a woman started shouting ""that's my baby's daddy!""  That was longer than I meant it to be. My bad."

We planned on going to cannon beach this weekend, but I really want to find a place that I can just pitch a tent for a night with out any money being involved. We are not good on funds but want to spend this weekend in the woods or by the water. Does ""First come first serve"" on the campsites mean that there is no cost? If so, that has opened up a whole new door for my searching abilities. LOL! Thanks in advance, I can use all the advice I can get."

But since you asked about Tacoma the best place for an amazing burger, fries and drink is Shake Shake Shake near Stadium. This is a unique diner-era place and hands down the winner. But since there's only one Shake Shake Shake, if you need a quick burger on the go look for a Sonic.  If you're headed toward Seattle, stop by Fatburger in Federal Way. They have the best burgers in the state, ""fat"" fries, and even serve beer. My favorite burger place.  A close second is the odd & tiny Quick Pick stand in nearby Fife. All their burgers are super fresh and good, and they have amazing shakes. Curiously, they're closed in winter, have no indoor seating and take only cash. But their uniqueness is also what makes them great. Stop by if you're near the Emerald Queen."

It was spectacular - the colors, the little lakes - everything.  But the bears.  Holy moly there are lots of bears up there!  We saw 7 total, including a mama with two cubs (on the next ridge, going away from us - whew!).  And I've heard 7 is on the low side.  Most backpackers see more than that on this loop!   But the bears were all very skittish, except for one who just ignored us, despite the fact that the trail was about 50 feet from him, and we were talking so he knew we were there.  That's not behavior I like to see in a bear - I want them to be afraid of humans.  Best for everyone involved.   As others have posted, Enchanted Valley is closed right now.  But ONP is a big place, lots of nice places still open.   I did Hoh River Valley last weekend.  It was a good hike for early in the season.  Damp, of course.  Lots of birds - Harlequin Ducks!  And a herd of elk that were seemingly unafraid of humans.  Prints in the sand that we're pretty sure were Bobcat.    But as nice as the Hoh is, it's nothing like the Seven Lakes Basin.   And yeah, raccoons can go #$%^ themselves."
Tacoma,36ya7c,Just_A_Dogsbody,4,Tue May 26 00:46:03 2015 UTC,"You have two choices that I'd recommend.   Do the Sol Duc High Dovide/Seven Lakes Basin loop trail. Camp two nights along the trail. I'd recommend camping one night near heart lake and another in the seven lakes basin. Climb Mt. Carrie on one day. From the High Divide you get fantastic views of Mt. Olympus, the bailey range, and the Hoh river valley. Since it's a loop trail, you don't have to backtrack. Hoh river trail, which I don't think is good as option 1 UNLESS you want to climb Olympus, which requires glacier travel experience and equipment.    For that you have to hike in over 15 miles of river trail until you can get out of the trees above elk lake. This gets old fast. I'd recommend camping one night at glacier meadows on Olympus. This is 2.3 miles from elk lake   Since it's not a loop trail you have to backtrack the same 15 miles on the way back which can again be annoying.

Lot's of people like MSM or Magical Sandwich Makers. I think TOT or HG is better but you should decide. Burgers: Frisko Freeze, Burger Broiler, or Freisenburgers. Frisko is a landmark in Tacoma - gotta try it. Burger Broiler is super cheap and very tasty. Ferisenburgers is kinda pricy but if you like burgers they'll make you see god. Dougnuts: Pao's donughts. It'll change your life. Pizza: Ah Badabing, and The Rock are both really good. Ah Badabing is a weird one, with odd events that they have every other week night or so but the pizza is amazing - also they sell a 26"" pizza. The rock is one of my favorite places because of the theme, but the food is great too. Sushi: Trappers is easy - not great and it's heavily Americanized but easy to bring a date to. for the good stuff, I really like Gari of Sushi Edit: Wow I really regret putting Trappers in here. It's basically the only place my wife likes because she won't eat fish. They have several vegetarian rolls that are quite good and that's the only way I can enjoy seafood while on datenight. If you know sushi and like sushi avoid Trappers if you can. Greek: there's a place called Gyro zone on 40th and Bridgeport that's really good. It recently came under new management but I still like it - great gyros and really good shwarma.  Sorry i don't know of any middle eastern or tea rooms. Also my wife doesn't eat seafood so I rarely get to go to places that exclusively serve it. I've heard Anthonys is really good and Stanley and Seaforts is a steak and seafood restaurant that should still be really good.  Quirky restaurants: The Melting Pot is all Fondue. Tatanka Takeout serves bison burgers. Gateway to India and India Mahal are the only Indian choices.  Bars: Irish pub: Paddy Coynes has AMAZING meatloaf. Edit:Apparently they closed :( Tequila bar: The Matador is my fav for tacos Brewery: Odd Otter. Ottermellon Hefeweizen is really amazing. Special note: Dorky's Bar-cade is an arcade that sells beer, it's pretty amazing if you're into video games.    Edits: readability and spelling Added MSM to list of Sandwich places Added Gyro Zone Explained why I included Trappers."
Tacoma,36uj6k,GMJoey,4,Fri May 22 07:24:18 2015 UTC,The India Express place at the food court in Freighthouse Square serves fantastic Indian food.
Tacoma,36uj6k,invisibleoctopus,0,Fri May 22 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"I need to get back there, I haven't been inside Freighthouse Square in what feels like forever."
Tacoma,36uj6k,GMJoey,3,Sat May 23 07:06:53 2015 UTC,Thanks I'll check some of these places out! I've never had ceviche and I'm interested in trying it out! The bison burgers sound good too!
Tacoma,36uj6k,GMJoey,1 point,Fri May 22 07:31:43 2015 UTC,OMG I thought this didn't post! I was so angry when I thought Reddit lost that huge paragraph!
Tacoma,36uj6k,Twonix,3,Fri May 22 07:46:47 2015 UTC,"Would've been a tragedy lol, you've got some good sounding stuff up there"
Tacoma,36uj6k,GMJoey,3,Fri May 22 07:51:28 2015 UTC,FYI Paddy Coynes is closed down.
Tacoma,36uj6k,CostumingMom,1 point,Fri May 22 23:45:22 2015 UTC,that gives me sadface
Tacoma,36uj6k,strangermouse,7,Sat May 23 07:06:08 2015 UTC,"Upvote for Pao's - Seriously good doughnuts.  I have not been to India Mahal, so I cannot compare, but Gateway to India is incredible."
Tacoma,36uj6k,GMJoey,2,Fri May 22 12:37:30 2015 UTC,Gateway to India also had the friendliest staff.
Tacoma,36uj6k,chuckluckles,2,Fri May 22 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"Pao's is my weakness - One of the reasons we turned down buying a particular house was because it was too close, and my wife knew I'd get fat."
Tacoma,36uj6k,Tpb3jd,1 point,Sat May 23 07:08:51 2015 UTC,India Mahal is also delicious!
Tacoma,36uj6k,Uhkneeho,2,Fri May 22 14:46:33 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree as to Top of Tacoma, Pao's, and Gyro Zone.  Gyro Zone is run by two gentlemen from the Levant that do an amazing job of bringing low cost Middle Eastern food to the table.  They went through hell getting their business approved (I have no connection to them; I just like to chat up people from the Middle East to better my language skills)."
Tacoma,36uj6k,CostumingMom,2,Sun May 24 03:10:19 2015 UTC,"Wait, where did paddy coyne's move to?"
Tacoma,36uj6k,Uhkneeho,4,Fri May 22 08:25:58 2015 UTC,"Paddy Coynes shut down about 2? years ago.  It was very sudden, even the employees didn't know until they showed up to locked doors.  (Hubby and I were regulars and got surprised, too.)"
Tacoma,36uj6k,shadybrainfarm,3,Fri May 22 12:36:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, that's why I was asking where it moved to, because he recommended it like it was open somewhere else."
Tacoma,36uj6k,Uhkneeho,2,Fri May 22 16:56:40 2015 UTC,Its a chain. There are a few in the Seattle area I don't think there's one in Tacoma at all anymore.
Tacoma,36uj6k,CostumingMom,2,Fri May 22 17:16:45 2015 UTC,That definitely makes more sense. I don't know why I never considered that it might be a chain. I guess It didn't have that vibe.
Tacoma,36uj6k,GMJoey,2,Fri May 22 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"According to their website, there are still two in Seattle and one in Bellevue."
Tacoma,36uj6k,Uhkneeho,0,Fri May 22 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"To be honest I hadn't been there in about 2 years, but the meal I had stuck with me and I've always been meaning to get back there. The news gave me sadface and I'm SUPER sorry if I got your hopes up."
Tacoma,36uj6k,Emberwake,1 point,Sat May 23 07:10:25 2015 UTC,"Oh no worries, I was just really amazed that it had come back. I had my mourning a while back. Had some really incredible nights there."
Tacoma,36uj6k,strangermouse,3,Sat May 23 09:58:08 2015 UTC,"Great list. The only thing I would add is Engine House 9, a pub just off 6th Ave. Solid pub food at reasonable prices, good specials, great pizza, and the best beer in town (honestly, unless you absolutely love local IPAs to the exclusion of everything else, their taps are better than The Red Hot).  Also, Gari of Sushi is definitely the place to go for Japanese. Trappers is a joke."
Tacoma,36uj6k,GMJoey,2,Fri May 22 21:16:18 2015 UTC,"E9 has amazing beer, but I get the shits after eating their food every time. I love sitting out on their patio for beers on a summer evening."
Tacoma,36uj6k,Donjuanme,0,Sat May 23 00:16:21 2015 UTC,"E9 is good, but just not that special to me. Not on my list of faves, but I'll eat there just the same. and I totally forgot about The Red Hot that one deserved to be on the list for sure!  Trappers is an easy date place, that is HYPER Americanized (Like I said). My wife doesn't eat fish so if I can ever get her to go to a sushi bar they're gonna have to have more than a few vegetarian rolls on menu. That being said, Trappers is often considered garbage if you know the difference between American sushi and Japanese sushi."
Tacoma,36uj6k,ModernDayNeanderthal,1 point,Sat May 23 07:15:26 2015 UTC,"legendary doughnuts on sixth street is also incredible, but I've not had paos, will have to try it"
Tacoma,36uj6k,strangermouse,1 point,Tue May 26 05:14:20 2015 UTC,Thanks. One of my goals this weekend is to try a few new places.
Tacoma,36uj6k,GMJoey,1 point,Fri May 22 13:13:49 2015 UTC,Pretty solid list and well thought out with one exception. Trapper's Sushi is straight up disgusting.
Tacoma,36uj6k,EternalNoob,0,Fri May 22 13:47:23 2015 UTC,"I felt the need to include Trappers because for my experience, I have a serious problem getting seafood on my plate it seems. My dad, best friend, and my wife hate seafood (so did my first wife). So I recommended Trappers as a place to bring people who don't know any better. Which is why I specified that the good stuff is at Gari"
Tacoma,36uj6k,AnonymousBeastXIII,3,Sat May 23 07:21:09 2015 UTC,It doesn't fit your criteria but Stink is my favorite restaurant in Tacoma. The salami sandwich is to die for. Comes with an amazing house salad too.
Tacoma,36uj6k,Momenem,3,Sun May 24 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"there is a tea room in lakewood on Gravely Lake  Dr SW (I think) across from the highschool/cover park school district office. White building, single story. I think the address is around 11063. Tried looking it up on google maps, can't get a clear shot of the name of the place. I've had tea there, it's fantastic! and their lunch is great too!"
Tacoma,36uj6k,thelordnihilus,2,Fri May 22 10:29:50 2015 UTC,"For tea, check out Ubiquitous Journey on 6th Ave. Most seafood spots are down on Ruston Way. Can't really help you with the Middle Eastern. Welcome to T-Town."
Tacoma,36uj6k,Momenem,2,Fri May 22 06:54:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'll check it out, any particular tea you like there?"
Tacoma,36uj6k,BoomBox206,4,Fri May 22 07:33:16 2015 UTC,Try Mat Hat Tea down on 11th and commerce also.
Tacoma,36uj6k,beaglesluvbluberries,2,Fri May 22 16:36:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not much of a tea person myself, but my roommate is. And that's her favorite place."
Tacoma,36uj6k,Brown17,3,Fri May 22 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"The Muckleshoot casino has a seafood buffet on Friday nights with king and dungeness crab plus prime rib and a lot of other stuff. Also the Emerald Queen Casino in Tacoma has all you can eat lobster on wed and sun, but it doesn't offer as many selections for sides and meats as Muckleshoot."
Tacoma,36uj6k,TheYancyStreetGang,3,Fri May 22 07:14:50 2015 UTC,"I've been looking for crab like crazy! I'll check the casino out, thank you!"
Tacoma,36upis,GMJoey,2,Fri May 22 07:31:13 2015 UTC,This sounds pretty cool. I am in the Tacoma area and love board games. Does this cost anything or is it just a meet up? I will see if my wife and I can make it.
Tacoma,36upis,agingnerds,0,Sun May 24 03:45:18 2015 UTC,They are both free events. Hope to see you there!
Tacoma,36upis,agingnerds,2,Sun May 24 04:33:09 2015 UTC,Sadly wont be able to make it this time around. My wife and I are going to try and make a trip to the coffee shop for sure. Thanks!!
Tacoma,36upis,notnotnotryan,2,Mon May 25 03:38:38 2015 UTC,I really want to make it out to one of these. I need some more local board game friends. All of mine live in Federal Way or Puyallup and getting together is near impossible.
Tacoma,36upis,mclassy3,0,Wed May 27 00:59:55 2015 UTC,What's keeping you? maybe there's something else we're doing you might be interested in.
Tacoma,36ud4e,itrhymeswithreally,4,Fri May 22 04:50:54 2015 UTC,"There are shuttles that can take you to the airport as well. I live on Fort Lewis and used Bremerton-Kitsap Airporter. It was $28 for the round trip ride, but I saw rates of $15 for one way from Tacoma."
Tacoma,36ud4e,djak,7,Fri May 22 05:49:16 2015 UTC,trusty route 574 from the tacoma dome to the airport. comfy and cheap. you can take the link rail from by the pantages down to the dome.
Tacoma,36ud4e,invisibleoctopus,6,Fri May 22 06:18:25 2015 UTC,There is a bus that goes from tdome station to the airport pretty early and runs late.
Tacoma,36ud4e,hobo1942,3,Fri May 22 05:19:49 2015 UTC,"This is the best and cheapest way. Costs about $3 if I remember correctly, plus maybe $2 for the bus to get to Tacoma Done Station. its a real cheap trip. Takes a little more than an hour usually."
Tacoma,36ud4e,ShakeInBake,2,Fri May 22 06:53:49 2015 UTC,Thank you I will definitely check that out
Tacoma,36ud4e,rook218,1 point,Fri May 22 13:37:33 2015 UTC,"Do a search in this sub for similar threads, I can't remember the exact details, but know that I was in the same situation and there were a lot of really helpful replies with specific details.  The bus is definitely the way to go if you're looking for cheap, I've done it four or five times to the airport.  And welcome to Tacoma!"
Tacoma,36ud4e,graffiksguru,0,Sat May 23 05:14:40 2015 UTC,"Yup, but since I usually try to save myself some money with early/ late flights it can be dodgy. I think it runs from 6 AM to 11 pm so it's not great for the red eye."
