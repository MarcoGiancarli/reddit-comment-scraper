For example, is there a particular aspect your keen on? I.E. gaming, networking, etc. or are you interested in the whole spectrum of C.S.'s? I have always loved building web sites but lately I have started trying to learn different languages and I have heard it is easier with partners/groups."
springfieldMO,3e6ip4,munky101,2,Wed Jul 22 10:15:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I could've been specific, but I thought that might be too limiting for conversation. I think I would be interested in the whole computer science spectrum if dived into that society. Personally, all on my own, I've been interested in networking (kinda decent, but not good), and would be interested in learning Python. HTML5 would be fun too I think.  Yeah, it really affects you, who you are surrounded by. It can really influence you. I had only a buddy back in the day and that's how I got started in computers. And that's my hope here. Help me kick my interests into overdrive.  I just want some friends that I listen to instead of talk, or have a conversation for an hour about a specific field of interest. I talk to my wife about a general subject of routers, and within 2 minutes I can tell I've lost her interest. It disheartening, being surrounded by folks with no interest in your interests."

springfieldMO,3dx29v,theforce34,2,Mon Jul 20 20:51:02 2015 UTC,"Personally anytime fitness and the YMCA are my favorites in Springfield due to what they have available and anytime has low member numbers so the gym is never packed. Rumor is 10 fitness is buying the old mercy building here soon, so that will quickly be a competitor to all the others just due to the facility. But currently 10 fit is too small for how many members they have. Genesis is a great gym, not a fan of the style of customer they bring in."
springfieldMO,3dx29v,theforce34,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:41 2015 UTC,How much is Anytime Fitness?
springfieldMO,3dx29v,CommandoLee,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:38 2015 UTC,Average $40/month. But they have quite a few locations that are included with that and tanning if you care for skin cancer.
springfieldMO,3dx29v,aproposse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:57:01 2015 UTC,I don't. I'm pale and see no reason to change that.
springfieldMO,3dx29v,cobraman115,2,Tue Jul 21 01:21:31 2015 UTC,If you live on the SW side then i'd say Planet Fitness. There is one on Republic and Scenic. They're dirt cheap and have pretty nice equipment.
springfieldMO,3dx29v,theforce34,2,Mon Jul 20 10:54:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with CommandoLee. You aren't going to find a facility that meets both your needs and wants, except maybe Genesis Health Clubs (formerly Ozark Fitness), but their website is down, and I believe they have old equipment. Your two best options are:  Planet Fitness - $10 per month no contract, 24/7, new equipment, showers, kept very clean. Downside is there are only Smith machines for barbell workouts and dumbbells only go up to 75 lbs. That being said, a lot of pretty big guys work out there and seem to do fine with weights they have available. No pool or sauna either.  Cox Meyer Center - Haven't been there in a few years, but it was a really nice facility with pool/sauna/basketball court/running track. The drawback here is that it isn't open 24/7, but is open 7 days a week at 5 or 6 am. If you can work your schedule around that, it has more of your ""Wants"" than any other place. Looks like a year membership will end up being $50/month on autopay."

springfieldMO,3domfg,doublevariable,4,Sat Jul 18 06:13:02 2015 UTC,It has always confused me why Christians feel the need to stock up for the End of Days. Aren't they supposed to all get summoned off to be with God while the rest of us heathens suffer Hell on Earth?
springfieldMO,3domfg,damnedscholar,3,Sat Jul 18 02:12:13 2015 UTC,"There was a pretty seminal book published in 1970 called The Late Great Planet Earth. It was a best-seller that pointed to current events at the time and said they were foretold by the Bible, mostly The Book of Revelation and a few books from the Old Testament. The author predicted the end of the world by 1988. If I recall correctly, not everyone gets automatically summoned to Heaven. Rather there is either a 3.5 or 7 year period (I can't remember exactly) of global war and economic collapse, and the people left on earth have an opportunity to get into Heaven/Kingdom of God at the end of this period. Even though the world did not end in 1988, people thought the book was largely right -- just had the date wrong. The Left Behind Series (at least the first book) is very similar to what The Late Great Planet Earth was about.  A lot of eschatological thought has to do with unrest in the Middle East. And since there's been unrest in the Middle East for quite some time, predictions of imminent apocalypse have and probably will continue to be made.  Interesting tidbit: One main tenet of these theories is that the Temple in Jerusalem will be rebuilt for the third and penultimate time shortly before the apocalypse. Some Christians who advocate for rebuilding the temple see it as a pathway to the apocalypse which they say is ultimately a good thing.  I apologize for the long response. I took a ""Literature of the Apocalypse"" class in college and it was extremely fascinating. I never thought it would come in handy when reporting on southwest Missouri, though. Thanks for reading the article!  TL;DR: Some people think there will be major war/catastrophes in run-up to apocalypse, at the end of which they can still be saved.  *edit: typo"
springfieldMO,3domfg,giacomo_bologna,2,Sat Jul 18 14:19:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reference. I looked up the book and found this on Wikipedia:   Lindsey also predicted that the European Economic Community, which preceded the European Union, was destined (according to Biblical prophecy) to become a ""United States of Europe"", which in turn he says is destined to become a ""Revived Roman Empire"" ruled by the Antichrist.   That makes way too much sense, with the fearmongering that goes on about America becoming like Europe."
springfieldMO,3domfg,damnedscholar,3,Sat Jul 18 18:52:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's still on Netflix, but if it is watch episodes of Doomsday Preppers when you need a laugh.  Back to your question, these types believe that the End of Days will be the final product after a long series of apocalyptic scenarios, mostly caused by some race or religion that has committed the crime of being different. So the supplies are to help them get through the hairy parts. This is also the time when it's cool to kill people, even though Jesus said not to do that, because they might try to steal your giant cans of creamed corn.  Eventually God will be satisfied with the amount of suffering and destruction He's allowed to happen in the world. Only then will He call a time out and bust out the fiery chariot taxi services for the super good people who hoarded food instead of sharing it with those in need.  Edit: typos"

springfieldMO,3dew2m,tagop,3,Thu Jul 16 08:52:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, capitalism doesn't have any plans for you- it's an idea, it doesn't make plans, it just gets enacted by people, and anything people decide to attribute to it or do in the name of it is on them, just like any other idea. Luciferians aren't strictly against capitalism, either; in fact, a lot of groups based on Luciferianism or Satanism are very, very for capitalism and the 'survival of the fittest' mentality (more so Satanists, but there's a good bit of crossover).  If you want to do something about capitalism, your best bet is to enter politics and take power from the people promoting it. Being a vagrant punk is fine and people enjoy it, but don't try to attribute any meaning to it other than 'I want to live in a cave and have nothing to do with the rest of the world or how it functions'. Because if you want any sort of change, that won't help at all.  And if you're more interested in the occultism of it all, there are better ways of starting out on that than joining a cult."

Let alone you have a data cap.  550 GB is small, I would hit that every month, especially if I had that download speed.  I already hit that with my Uverse at 20Mb speeds.   www.sifinetworks.com/nixa Sadly it seems the page talking about the Sifi networks deal is gone.  http://www.nixa.com/index.aspx?page=6 Here is a paywall free story about the Sudden change. 😎  Edit: Added additional links"
springfieldMO,3cpudh,techhorder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have heard that the SiFi deal is no more.  It is unclear if this Gigabit cable internet announcement is a temporary measure while working on new Gigabit fiber internet plans, or if making Gigabit fiber available to all residents is dead all together.  I agree that a 550GB data cap on a Gigabit connection seems very low. A 1Gbps connection can download 550GB in 74 minutes. At a minimum, it seems like the cap increase should be proportional to the speed increase (e.g. if 100Mbps includes 350GB cap, 1000Mbps should include 3500GB cap).  Suddenlink claims that their caps represent usage of 95% of their customers, and that they will continue to increase caps as overall usage increases. Widespread adoption of high-bandwidth services such as Netflix 4K will hopefully force them to upgrade caps across the board."
springfieldMO,3cpudh,keggers5000,2,Fri Jul 10 15:54:17 2015 UTC,"This sounds cool, but data caps on home internet are beyond ridiculous. Having just moved to the area it blows my mind what ISPs are able to get away with here."
springfieldMO,3cpudh,burksdb,2,Fri Jul 10 11:45:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I considered switching to AT&T when the cable ISP implemented data cap several years ago, only to find that AT&T already had identical data caps. :/  Last time I checked, the majority of our usage was related to streaming video (Netflix and Amazon). I would expect anyone switching from Cable TV to streaming services to exceed their bandwidth caps on occasion.  Switching to Netflix 4K won't even be an option until we start to see 3TB caps or higher. 4K consumes up to 30GB per hour, so 3TB would allow viewers to watch 100 hours/month (3.3 hours/day).  We also use cloud backup services for our personal computers, but that bandwidth usage was surprisingly low. Makes sense that once you get past the initial backup, bandwidth usage is minimal.  https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140218/11532626269/house-cards-4k-will-eat-broadband-caps-like-popcorn-shrimp.shtml"
springfieldMO,3cpudh,chucicabra,2,Fri Jul 10 16:55:30 2015 UTC,was super disappointed in the whole sifi deal and the suddenlink offer is a joke for anyone who is really going to use the connectoin.

springfieldMO,3cpudh,chucicabra,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:15:31 2015 UTC,"Suddenlink, City of Nixa, and Nixa Chamber made this joint announcement at 1pm today.  I attended the press conference at Nixa City Hall and clarified several technical questions with the Suddenlink representative.  Details below.  Reply below with questions.  If I do not know the answer, I will try to find out.  As a business owner, I am very excited about this. Sounds like their business rates will be comparable to (or better than?) the business Gigabit rates in Springfield. Working to confirm this.  In addition to the new Gigabit speed announcement, existing customers with certain speeds will automatically receive free speed increases (e.g. 75Mbps and 100Mbps customers upgraded to 100Mbps and 200Mbps, respectively) if their modem is capable of the new speed. Suddenlink also announced that they will be making FTTP (Fiber Gigabit) available to all businesses in the Nixa Industrial Park by Fall 2015.  I called Customer Service and requested pricing. They confirmed service is available now. I currently pay $64/mo for 75Mbps (now 100Mbps) with 350GB data cap.  I can upgrade to 1Gbps for $134/mo. Plan includes 50Mbps upstream and 550GB data cap. Requires lease of a Gigabit modem and 10 days to schedule Professional Installation. Still waiting for them to callback to confirm installation fees (if any) and monthly modem lease fee. They specifically told me that the Gigabit modem cannot be purchased from Suddenlink and is not yet available via retail channels.  I suspect they are using DOCSIS 3.1 modems, which other ISP's claim be available via retail channels in late 2015 or early 2016.  While they did not address this during the press conference, I have been told that the upgrades are available to all customers in the vicinity, not just Nixa!

springfieldMO,3cpudh,techhorder,3,Thu Jul 9 20:46:35 2015 UTC,I can upgrade to 1Gbps for $134/mo. Plan includes 50Mbps upstream and 550GB data cap.    Am I understanding this wrong or can you reach you data cap in ~92 minutes?
springfieldMO,3cpudh,PM_ME_UR_HTTPD_CONF,3,Fri Jul 10 02:07:38 2015 UTC,"Downloading 550GB over Gigabit internet should take 73.3 minutes if you have adequate network hardware. Your generous estimate assumes 20% overhead on their end.  ISPs try to provide you with the usable bandwidth speed they advertise. They already factor in overhead on their end. When you run a speed test on a 50Mbps connection, the test results should indicate 50Mbps download speeds, not 40Mbps (50 - 20%).  Calculations:  550GB (Gigabytes) * (8 bits / 1 byte) = 4400Gb (Gigabits)  4400 Gb * (1 sec / 1Gb) = 4400 seconds  4400 seconds  * (1 min / 60 sec) = 73 min 20 sec"

springfieldMO,3cibz2,PM_ME_UR_HTTPD_CONF,5,Wed Jul 8 12:09:48 2015 UTC,"As a front end developer here in town, there's really only one way to do it.   First, as someone had already mentioned, go to www.codecademy.com, do the html, php, css, ruby, and any other courses that appeal to you.   That's only the first step. The next step, go to one.com, get yourself a domain and hosting (they're free for the first year) and just start making websites. Learn what it feels like. Get frustrated. Stay awake until 5 am to figure out that it was a missing semicolon in your php stack that broke your page.  Building and hosting you own pages is great, because then you have an idea of how the whole pipeline works. Not just how to call things from someone else's work. You're more valuable when you know more.   Then: apply apply apply. Just shotgun applications to places with a link to some of the better sites you developed. Someone will pick you up. And until they do, keep hacking. Keep building. Get better and better. That way when the call comes in you can blow their doors off. I'm a developer and have what amounts to an art degree. All I that I know about code, I learned myself.   Love it enough to let it consume your free time. Be fluent in what you do. Be proud of it.   Nam sayin?"

After that (or during) get into JavaScript frameworks which you will see make your life so much easier, you may as well do jQuery since it is by far the most popular.

springfieldMO,3c0t6g,Aholidayatc,4,Fri Jul 3 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"Springfield city code requires grass be kept under 12 inches.  From a News Leader article:  How are violations handled? When a complaint is made to the city, an inspector visits the property to verify that the weeds violate the city height restriction or are creating a danger because of pests or other hazards. The inspector then posts a notice giving the occupant 12 days to mow the property.  A notice is mailed to the property's owner, as well, who can request a hearing if the owner objects to the city's assessment.  The property is reinspected after 12 days have passed. If no other action has been taken, the city can call in a contracted mower to cut the grass. The bill is then charged to the property owner and can be collected as part of their property tax bill.  What you can do: Mow your lawn regularly and report property you think is in violation of the city's ordinance. Reports can be made by calling Springfield's Citizen Resource Center at 417-864-1010, or by filling out a form online at www.springfieldmo.gov/request."

springfieldMO,3bvl9s,TheLinksOfAdventure,7,Thu Jul 2 20:45:00 2015 UTC,"He deserved what he got, but it's about rights. Your rights and mine. The fact that you are so eager to give them up concerns me. Take this quote by Ben Franklin for example:  ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.""  What about the rest of the 1200 people who were completely innocent and still subject to searches (and had their commute delayed while the officers were getting paid overtime with our taxes)? How would you like them coming to your home and searching without consent to see if you are breaking any laws? You probably are, even if you don't know it. How would you like to be arrested for that movie you pirated or that lobster you bought at the store that isn't big enough to be legal (It is a federal crime to be in possession of a lobster under a certain size. It doesn't matter if you bought it at a grocery store, if someone else gave it to you, if it's dead or alive, if you found it after it died of natural causes, or even if you killed it while acting in self-defense. You can go to jail because of a lobster.) Those are just examples of course but the point stands if we allow certain rights to be taken more rights will be taken in the future and when liberty is gone it's gone for good.  And those four people arrested for marijuana... Regardless of how you feel about it the weed prohibition is ending. It doesn't say but I have a feeling they all weren't driving high. They could have just seen a bong or pipe in the back seat, or smelled it a little bit and made an arrest potentially ruining that person's future even if they weren't endangering anybody.   Of course everybody is against drunk driving but this wasn't even exclusively a dui checkpoint. It was set up during the middle of the day so law enforcement could look for people breaking even the pettiest of laws and I'm against it. Sorry if you don't like freedom.

Obviously this is all opinion which we can both have differences on.  They are both legitimate fears and concerns to have don't get me wrong. I just don't see anyone carrying around a bottle of whiskey waiting for the right person to hit with their car.

There's also the Gillioz theater downtown which features some good acts time to time. I just saw Craig Ferguson's standup there and it was great.   Poetry slams, improv shows, open mics, comedy shows, and even a late night talk show are also featured downtown and can be a fun break from the norm.   Check out Mother's Brewery. They always have stuff going on, like bocci ball on Wednesdays.

springfieldMO,3bu89b,TummyDrums,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:05:32 2015 UTC,"Bourbon can certainly be called American Whiskey, however the distinction is in the mash bill (grains that make up the beer that is distilled). Bourbon has to be made of at least 51% corn, rye has to be made from at least 51% rye grain, and American whiskey can be any American distilled whiskey product that doesn't necessarily fall into those mash bills. Example, McCarthy’s Oregon Single Malt Whiskey, is made from 100% malted barley. There are also whiskies like High West Distillery's Bourye whiskey, that is a blend of bourbons and ryes, making a new product that is neither bourbon or rye, but a blended American whiskey.  There is  ton of educational stuff out there that has been extremely helpful for me in my journey into Whiskey. The r/bourbon page has been especially helpful. Cheers!"

It's a god damn shame everyone has their panties in a bunch over that white kid shooting a bunch of black people and suddenly we need to get rid of the confederate flag. How about all the black people that shoot white people every day? Why doesn't that make national news? And what about the mental health of the kid who shot up that church? Are we seriously going to sit here and try to get rid of a flag instead of investigating what is more than likely a mental health issue? There are plenty of racists in this country but you don't see them running around shooing other races all the time. How fucking stupid is everyone?   Oh let's ban a flag! That'll stop racism! /s  Bunch of fucking retards.

Which isn't a bad thing, it is something and someone new every week (a couple of weeks ago they had a full ragtime band!!), but just not what you get the rest of the year. Historically UU churches would close completely over the summer, but now the minister just takes a vacation!  And yes, very liberal. UUs are a creedless religion, which means you don't HAVE to believe anything, but if you do, that's cool too. The services are often on topics of social justice or humanistic. I was raised a UU, but didn't really attend for a decade, but came back for similar reasons you mention- a community and for my kids.

According to one of my high school teachers, all of the copies of the yearbooks he was in that were in the schools' respective libraries were locked away in a safe so as to dissuade reporters from coming in and trying to get some sort of scoop about his youth. Before the online gossip blogs stole the skeezy celebrity-stalking limelight, E! and VH1 had the monopoly on it. I think VH1 even tried snooping once, but didn't get much, so made up some stuff about ""Brad's hometown of Kickapoo, Missouri"" at which point they showed the KHS baseball dugout with ""Kickapoo"" emblazoned on the side.

When he got it back, the thing looked perfect, you could never tell he worked on it. He does get backed up from time to time though.   If you need it back quicker, Springfield Music is great. They do really great work and have more people in their shop so their turnaround isn't as bad. Springfield Music has been stepping up their expensive gear game recently, so they definitely understand the need to treat things with respect.  The guy at Guitar Center, Alex, is also pretty good. I've had him fix a guitar headstock before. He's not as good as Hoover and Springfield Music, but he does quality work.

Gypsy is older than her mom claimed. Relatives say she was born premature but had no other issues. She scraped her knee as a kid and after that her mom went full crazy (including putting her on seizure meds which made her teeth fall out). Many people knew she was not ill and could walk. She'd tried to escape at least once before and her mom dragged her back home. She may have been the dominant one in the relationship with her boyfriend (that has BDSM undertones). Boyfriend and boyfriend's dad are sex offenders.  Oh, and she said once that all she wanted to do was be a normal girl and fall in love."

Crabtree cove at Stockton is pretty awesome. Nice cliffs to jump off and maybe a bit cleaner.   The creek at busiek can be nice but often dries up.  The buffalo is about an hr and half south and has great swimming and floating.  If you want to drive a ways, there are some really clean and beautiful springs a couple hrs east of town, alley springs and blue springs are two that come to mind.  Johnson shuttins is about 3hrs east and is definitely worth checking out - it's my favorite of what I listed. If you do go out there be sure to check out elephant rocks.  edit: there's also panther creek. I think you take division or catalpa or cherry east past 65 for 5 miles or so.

Pappo's Pizzeria downtown on Walnut has really good pizza as well.   Both of our Indian restaurants have good food and are pretty similar. The service might be a little better at Taj mahal.  Taylor's Steakburgers at the weird corner of Benton/Kimbrough and E Trafficway. They have really good steakburgers in a small-town diner atmosphere.  That Lebanese Place on Commercial is really good.

There might still be that aspect of ""forbidden love"" even if it's along the lines that the mom/aunt/guardian disapproved of the relationship because maybe it was detracting from their scam(s)."

Posts from people who knew them:   With our hearts torn this evening, I pray that everyone will see both sides of this saga. I am not condoning anyone's actions, but I certainly understand how and why this tragedy has happened. Please just remember these words and realize that their are victims on both sides. No one EVER really knows what goes on behind closed doors.  I have seen plenty of things that were disturbing when gypsy was a small child and knew that dee dee was up to some evil things. Never thought someone would be sick in that sorta way. My family can all tell a few stories. I hope people can finally get the real truth that dee dee has been hiding all these years. Poor child was just as normal as the rest of us but was pushed to snap by her mother.  She was a healthy girl and one day was in a minor accident. She had a brush burn on her knee. Her mother took that to full extreme and would fake dr visits...tell the family that she would need surgeries to fix it. Dee dee had her in a wheelchair. When her mother wasn't looking, gypsy would push the other cousins around in it, jump on the trampoline..stuff like that. But when dee dee would see her she had to get back in the chair. Once the family called dee dee out on all the nonsense, she fled and never stopped getting as far as she could.  Someone else just posted that Gypsy tried running away a few years ago but DeeDee brought her back claiming she was underage. Sounds like Gypsy may have been tired of the chirade and not being able to live like a ""normal"" girl.   The whole thing is crazy. The fraud to that scale alone is insane."

springfieldMO,39v7b3,mcnew,5,Mon Jun 15 02:55:28 2015 UTC,"The Bride Under the Bridge is a local variation of a popular myth involving dead brides and water.  Many communities have tales about bridges haunted by jilted brides, widowed brides and unfaithful brides murdered by jealous husbands or lovers.  Such stories serve primarily into scaring young women into fidelity.  In most legends, the unfaithful are always punished by death - often in water.  Similar brides are reported near wells, rivers, and bridges.  There is a similar story involving a native American princess in love with a man from a rival tribe who jumped to her death into Devil's Pool on Table Rock Lake rather than marry the man her father sold her to.    The Springfield version is that a couple driving across the 3rd bridge in Phelps Grove Park on their wedding day wrecked their car.  The groom escaped, but the bride perished.  No verifiable evidence of such an accident has been found and this is one of the most researched ghost stories in Springfield.    According to local legend the bride's spirit wanders beneath the 3rd bridge holding the hem of her wedding dress as if she is trying to keep it out of the water.  She has been reported as a full body apparition wearing a wedding dress and veil, but where her face should be there is only darkness.    It's a lovely story, but also one of the least likely to be based in fact."

springfieldMO,39v7b3,mcnew,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:51:03 2015 UTC,"Local history and ghost stories are my hobby!  The Albino Farm is a pretty popular legend.  I have recited here an account combining elements of all the stories I've read that seem to be the most consistent and believable.    The Sheedy family owned and operated a lovely plantation farm around the Civil War until the turn of the century.  It was a true antebellum estate called ""Springlawn"" and the family was well off by any definition.    As it happens, time changes things.  The Sheedy's fortune ran out.  There was ""mental instability"" in the family.  The last survivors of the original owners were two spinster sisters who lived on the farm with an albino caretaker or farm hand in the late 1890's - 1910.   The rumor is that one of the sisters was romanced by a con man.  He saw the large house, barn and outbuildings and smelled money. He worked his charm on one of the sisters and a wedding was soon to be announced.    And then the suitor disappeared.  He left never to return, leaving his spinster sweetheart heartbroken.  She lived out her years at the estate alone but for her loyal albino friend.  The estate passed from hand to hand within the family until the final Sheedy passed and the estate was auctioned in 1979.  A large part of it including a barn and a really fantastic 12 room manor house complete with stone turrets burned in 1980.   Around that time I became aware of the Albino Rumors.  My parents were friends with Bill Zieres the fire marshal at the time who investigated the fire (suspected to be arson).    When I was old enough to go on real dates with boys, we often drove out to the Albino Farm and creep down the road as far as we dared.  If we really felt brave, we would get out and explore the remaining stone structures.  It's a wonder we weren't killed.  Many people claim to see ghosts.  I personally never saw one, but someone always seemed to have a story about ""my sister's roommate"" or ""my cousin saw..."" the ghost of an albino man in farm work clothes that chases trespassers away.    It has been suggested the ghost is the old albino farmhand protecting the sisters.   Once jilted, sisters wanted to be alone and the albino drove away any trespasser with a shotgun (or ax) and that his spirit dwells there still to protect his heartbroken mistress.    The more romantic version is that the albino was in love with the sister and killed the romantic rival with a hatchet or ax and protects the shallow grave the man is buried in."

But he didn't seem to be able to get out, and was calling for Mama, so we didn't quite know how to handle things, as we'd heard many a tale about people getting the crap kicked out of them by a protective Mama deer.   A call to the Nature Center seems to have solved our conundrum.  We opened the gate per their instruction, and didn't see the deer this morning when we peeked back there.

Lady told us the mama wouldn't approach us unless we cornered her, so it'd be safe to go back there and open the gate.

Wilson's Creek has a great (hilly) 5 mile paved loop as well as wonderful trails if you are considering beginning trail running.   The Frisco Highline from Kearney St in Springfield runs all the way to Bolivar and switched to crushed gravel after Willard and is usually a great spot.   If you're looking for a neighborhood to run in, Phelps Grove is a favorite.   Lots of local running groups as well if you decide that might be up your alley."

springfieldMO,389m37,markgullett,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:31:10 2015 UTC,"Most of the greenways trails have distance markers on the pavement.  Every tenth of a mile i believe.  If you start at the northern end of Galloway (Pershing Middle School) it's about 2 miles to Sequiota park.  The total length is about 6 miles end to end.  Some hours of some days you can run the 3 mile loop at the Springfield Nature Center which is very pretty with a variety of surfaces and several good climbs.  For trail running, I like Busiek Conservation Area south of Ozark off Hwy 65, Sac River Trails north of Springfield off Hwy 13 and Two Rivers Mountain Bike Park south of Nixa."
springfieldMO,389m37,damnedscholar,2,Wed Jun 3 02:52:15 2015 UTC,"Phelps Grove Park has a nice circular path around the perimeter. If you ask around, someone might know the length of it.  For scenery, I prefer the Lone Pine trail from Seminole down through Sequiota Park."
springfieldMO,389m37,MrGrandfather,2,Tue Jun 2 23:27:33 2015 UTC,One lap is 0.7 miles.

Also don't forget items which you provide that may be used up, thinner, primer, roller covers.  I would also bill my travel time at the same rate, but that is negotiable.  Determine the hourly rate appropriate to your value and give them an estimate of the number of hours it would take.  Then bill them for the actual hours worked, providing a time sheet. and a receipt for materials.  Some trades also mark up materials, I normally just include my shopping time in my invoice instead."

springfieldMO,385k45,Kid_Dynam1te,3,Tue Jun 2 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"Couple places to check out :    W. Norton road, right by where Central Bible College used to be. Great hills, not too much traffic later in the day. There's also some beautiful back roads nearby if you're looking for a cruise.  The paved trails in Nathaneal Greene Park. Right after you pass the golf course, there's a 1/2 - 3/4 mile decline that winds through the forest. Great experience; since it's summer, watch out for inattentive kids.  Good hill for a more low-key cruise : North Washington, going downhill from Commercial st. Riding the road can be for speed, but there's a stretch of brick sidewalk that feels incredible to cruise down. Usually not too much traffic, but it can be a sketchy part of town if you're there the wrong time of day."

springfieldMO,37k4yn,ShotInTheArm,6,Thu May 28 05:34:17 2015 UTC,"Vapor World on S. Campbell has an awesome atmosphere and a super friendly/helpful staff. The same can be said for Puff Smart on Glennstone across from the mall. As for juice, online is your best and cheapest bet. Vape wild had a ton of great flavors. My personal favorite is called Dragon Juice. Fruit hoops and stars and stripes are also quite fantastic. Now, the best choices for your tank will be the itaste mvp 3 (top choice for on board battery/charging), the IPV mini, or the smok 80. AVOID any innokin istick product. Terrible customer service and their products can explode with little to no warning.  Welcome the healthier choice and happy vaping! :)"
springfieldMO,37k4yn,GodzNotReal666,3,Thu May 28 06:50:06 2015 UTC,100% Agree. Vapor world has the friendliest staff I've ever met at a business.

springfieldMO,37k4yn,KCP100,2,Thu May 28 16:54:15 2015 UTC,Vapor World on republic road is great! Super helpful staff and great selection of juice.
springfieldMO,37k4yn,NX01,3,Fri May 29 21:19:16 2015 UTC,"Vapor World on Republic & Fremont is great. They have an awesome juice selection, both house and premium. I'm currently using an IPV3 box with a Kanger Subtank Mini. An IPV Mini would also work great for power. My gf ran a Nautilus off a 1200mA twister for a long time, but she's much happier with the Atlantis on the IPV Mini. For daily vaping, the Atlantis uses a little more juice but hits better and the atomizers last longer.  If you're looking at sticking with the vaping thing, the Subtank is great. My recurring cost at this point is juice and the trivial amount of cotton to re-wick instead of buying new atomizers. I run it at 15W and my 18650s in my IPV3 are good for 2 days at that rate."

springfieldMO,37k4yn,NX01,3,Thu May 28 15:25:32 2015 UTC,Palm beach vapor is a great little place downtown. The folks are friendly and more then willing to teach new people the tricks of the hobby. They aren't pushy either and they have reward points which is nice too.
springfieldMO,37k4yn,nomadbynature120,2,Thu May 28 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"It should also be said that any place is going to try to sell you a shitty kit, knowing that you'll want to upgrade. So if you think you'll stick with it, don't fall into that. As long as you don't get caught up in cloud-chasing, a box mod with at least a single 18650 will take you anywhere you want to go. Get two sets of batteries, one for you, one for the charger. Tanks are cheaper to experiment with, but I've used the Nautilus, Atlantis and Kangertech Subtank as well as the Troll RBA, and I can tell you that the Subtank using the rebuildable deck is the best for regular vaping."
springfieldMO,37k4yn,est1967,2,Tue Jun 2 09:45:03 2015 UTC,"I use the Nautilus Mini tank with two cheaper itaste batteries and I love it. I bought my set-up at Roll'n Tobacco on Glenstone. They are a family owned business and they will take the time to show you whatever you want and also teach you how to use whatever you buy. They will also let you try as many juice flavors as you like before making a decision, personally I like the Irish Tobacco flavor best. The Nautilus Mini tank is amazing and they definitely have them in stock over at Roll'n Tobacco right now, if I remember right they are under $40 and come with an extra coil. Whatever you do, do not go to Vapor Vender downtown, their inventory is shit and they will try and hard sell you anything for the commission.  Let me know if you have any questions about the Nautilus tank or Roll'n Tobacco."

I especially like your 4th pic.  Also may be out of place but the big necklace braided things are a turn off for me.  Not to say you shouldn't have them, but have other thin basic cords, etc available.  I'd rather have it on a chain (silver, gold) or even just a sturdy waxed hemp string (is that the right word?) from Walmart or a craft store.

springfieldMO,37iemd,Captain_Murica91,3,Wed May 27 21:26:26 2015 UTC,There is andy dalton which is run by the conservation dept. ozark shooters is privately owned and there is the springfield bench rest club that is a private range you might be able to join
springfieldMO,37iemd,rkl22447,2,Wed May 27 22:51:38 2015 UTC,"There's also Bass Pro in Springfield, Sound of Freedom in Ozark, and Busiek State Park south of there on 65. I don't know if Bass Pro or SoF allow rifles. Busiek basically allows everything."
springfieldMO,37iemd,dakej,2,Thu May 28 00:23:11 2015 UTC,Busiek state park has an outdoor range. On the west side of the highway. You can make lots of noise down there.
springfieldMO,37iemd,nomadbynature120,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:46:43 2015 UTC,"Indoor /u/dakej is correct you have Sound of Freedom and Bass Pro. Bass pro is $12 an hour and allows pistols 25yd and has a rifle tube 100yd for sighting in. Sound of Freedom is $15 for a lane no time limit when there is no waiting list. They do allow rifles on weekdays last time I checked as long as there is no steel core ammo.    Outdoor unmanned you have Busiek and Pleasant Hope near by which are both good locations, depending on the crowd sometimes you may have to wait because they are free.  Andy dalton that was mentioned by /u/rkl22447  is about 20 min northwest, is a manned shooting range that is $3 an hour and has many pistol/rifle lanes 100yd, and multiple skeet/trap stands as well. About 20 minutes south you also have ozarks shooters which has sporting clays, trap, 5 stand, skeet as well as rifle and pistol.   Another option is springfield rod and gun club which has a yearly membership and is a private member range which I believe has a limit on membership numbers but is great place to shoot if you get to know a member there."

springfieldMO,37iemd,tastethematzah,1 point,Thu May 28 02:35:18 2015 UTC,They have the same rule at Andy dalton 1 per second no rapid fire or double tap. Same rule at bass pro but sound of freedom allows it as long as you are hitting the target.

springfieldMO,36u9aj,turbulance4,7,Fri May 22 13:09:01 2015 UTC,"Americans treat houses like disposables for the most part, maybe due to the low standards for construction.  They'd rather build new (even if poorly built with no character or old growth trees) than renovate a 50s, 60s or 70s home.  We spend a little too much time indoors, putting features like granite counter tops and recessed lighting ahead of things like shorter commute and community parks.  Public schools have a lot to do with it too.  Economic disparities result in low-income pockets inside city limits.  This leads to strain on resources and over time pushes the good teachers out of the city.  [End lecture]"
springfieldMO,36u9aj,Jengis_Roundstone,3,Fri May 22 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"sure, those all may be valid points... but what does any of that have to do with the population of suburbs?"
springfieldMO,36u9aj,turbulance4,5,Fri May 22 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"I'm suggesting people move to places like Ozark because it's easier and cheaper to get a house in good shape, the schools present zero risk and all you have to do is drive more to work."
springfieldMO,36u9aj,Jengis_Roundstone,3,Fri May 22 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"That applies to KC & STL but not Spfd.  They both have tons of abandoned houses and decaying urban neighborhoods.  Springfield doesn't have any Detroit like areas, in fact Central is the highest rated HS in the metro.  New residents have to live somewhere and if Springfield isnt getting denser then it's going to keep sprawling.  Dense developments are also more expensive and the area doesn't have high enough property values to make it happen."

Basic rule (sadly) is that the further north you get, the worse the schools get. Are you shopping for public or private schools?"
springfieldMO,36s6s3,The_Doja,2,Fri May 22 14:14:39 2015 UTC,"We'll have one in pre-school, but from what I understand, those aren't really zoned the way elementary is.  Schools aren't a huge concern as we'll live there a year before we buy something, but I like to use school ratings to judge the quality of neighborhoods.  We'll be public schooling for sure when the time comes.  We're both educators, so we won't have the cash for private.  Also, I don't see obvious advantages of going private, when the public schools are of good quality."
springfieldMO,36s6s3,derb8412,2,Fri May 22 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points. I think you will be ok with schools in most parts of Springfield except (possibly) downtown and north side.

We have three young kids, two in school and the elementary is part of the International Baccalaureate program, Boyd. I believe Rountree Elementary is also. If you work downtown, I say don't go south of Sunshine St., but I'm biased to north sgf. For your price range you can live almost anywhere"
springfieldMO,36s6s3,derricklh88,3,Thu May 28 18:12:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty much any area for that amount of rent will be good. Rountree is an excellent school district. I live in the Delaware school area (just south of Rountree), and it's a nice, small school. In fact, there's a house for rent on Cozy off of National - just saw the sign today. No phone number, but I think the address is 1310 E. Cozy. That is most likely Rountree schools, possibly Delaware.  The homes are older, have character (also well-maintained), and the neighborhood around here (south-central Springfield) is just awesome. Phelps grove park, downtown, MSU, Mercy hospital are all within walking distance or just a short 5-minute drive. The neighborhood is cyclist-friendly for the most part; lots of runners and people just taking walks, too.   You could also head further south or east. With your budget, you could go anywhere; I'm just a huge fan of Midtown/Rountree/Phelps. Also, I've been taking a lot of cold/flu medicine . . . random flu bug hit me this week.  Also, is the $1k budget including utilities? Most properties here don't include utilities/trash/lawncare in the rent. Depending on the size of your home, that could be about $200-300 per month."

I used to live next to the bus station parking lot and it was just loud screaming till the early hours most nights. And forget about parking close Friday-Saturday unless you are home early. It was fun when I was 22, but if you're a grad student you might not be into the drinking downtown every night scene. If you are, the walk home is great."
springfieldMO,36pqkc,RDIIIG,3,Thu May 21 04:53:44 2015 UTC,I live in the area on jefferson. As long as you aren't literally on the square it's actually pretty quiet around here.
springfieldMO,36pqkc,Oddgenetix,3,Thu May 21 06:15:17 2015 UTC,"Hi, my name is Ben I live downtown.  The Frisco is a loft complex down on Jefferson & Olive as The1nOnlySilent have pointed out. Are you new to the area?   Currently the building across the street is being made into loft apartments the Woodruff. This means the street there will be under construction at times if not shut off at points. They will probably also be working on the water lines in the area as the building is older. Downtown has a higher crime rate than the rest of Springfield. Downtown also has more beggers in the area.  Now that we've covered all of that, downtown can be a wonderful place. You never have to drink and drive, just drink and stumble. Rent is higher down here but you've already settled on that. The frisco is near Fastnight park where they hold some moving showings during the summer. The gillioz is a stones throw away so bands are loading and unloading their equipment on Olive all the time. You are downtown at the music scene, you are also in the only place where Springfieldians will get out and walk around. Bikes have places downtown, just don't store it outside for to long; but we've already covered how downtown has more crime.  Plenty of places to eat out and take family when they visit. The Price Cutter Bistro has turned into a liquor store so for groceries there is always the Price Cutter on St Louis and National or on Grand and Kansas Exp.   If you have any specific questions of downtown feel free to ask, I've lived down here 4+ years, and worked here 7."
springfieldMO,36pqkc,ibenx,3,Thu May 21 08:29:14 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Springfield and go Panthers! Thought I'd pipe in and say that The Frisco is an income-controlled place(?). I forget what the term for it is, but you can't make more than a certain amount to live there and you have to apply for a spot. Definitely a cute little area, but when I was a college undergrad student I couldn't apply to live there due to my student status. I'm not sure how it would work for grad students, but you may want to give them a call and check on that.  A lot of apartments in the downtown area trend towards pricey or student housing, or both. There are some gems, though, and you may want to poke around here to look for some downtown lofts. There are a lot of rental houses in neighborhoods around SGF that will be looking for residents soon due to school being out of session. Not sure if there's a good website to look for those out there besides your typical house renting ones.   I live on Commercial Street and I personally love it. I do know a few friends who live/have lived in downtown and their general experience was positive, although noise was definitely a complaint for a lot of them. It's really kinda a block-by-block thing. Springfield's chock-full of cool little places, though, and you'll find something here that'll work great for you. Best of luck to you!"
springfieldMO,36pqkc,honeybadgerdgnf,2,Thu May 21 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"How is commercial street? It looks like it's made some progress in the past years, do you think that it can grow much more than it is?"
springfieldMO,36pqkc,ibenx,3,Fri May 22 00:20:27 2015 UTC,"Most of the main drag (Lyon to Washington) is occupied already, but there's a lot of business spaces that still aren't used for anything and a lot of loft areas that don't have anyone in them yet or are undeveloped. There's gonna be a huge celebration at the end of May on C-Street for all the new businesses that opened up this season, which is pretty sweet.   I really hope Ophelia's relocates to some place on C-Street, I would love that immensely and it would fit their vibe so perfectly. There was talk of an indie bookstore opening on C-Street too, which would round out our Moon City creative district quite well. Shawki3, no matter where you end up living, you have to go to Big Momma's on a Moon City open mic night. Have to have to.  Of course everyone's talking what's going to happen with the Missouri Hotel space. It'll probably be torn down or stripped to the studs and remodeled, but if anyone tries to make it ""student housing"", I'm going to fight that tooth and nail."

That being said, the park on the north side of the Frisco (founders) is really neat and you can watch people doing some free running and such. The only issue I have ever ran into down there are the occasional hard drug users you may see lurking about. No judgement intended on their choices, just not a fan of bringing my son to a park while someone is using I.V. drugs sitting on the fountain.   Living Downtown should not be an issue as long as you keep in mind this is a city and realistically, things can get dirty. I have seen both the lowest of behaviors out of people(and that wasn't one of the homeless but a proper college student) down here and some of the most deep and selfless of behaviors.

In bigger cities in the U.S, candidates typically do declare a party and might have to run in a primary."

springfieldMO,36epmy,diyguac,3,Mon May 18 21:00:25 2015 UTC,"It varies depending on the city and how the city government is set up. Springfield operates under a charter system. You can read more about it here: http://www.springfieldmo.gov/145/City-Council  In Springfield, the mayor as well as the other city council members have a relatively low amount of power. The mayor presides over the council meetings. The city manager(hired position) is actually the chief executive and oversees the day to day operations of the city. The easiest parrallel I can think off the top of my head is a corporation that has a board(council) and a ceo(city manager) that actually runs the corporation(city). There are a few on this subreddit that know much more about the inter workings of the city that could be more helpful than I can."
springfieldMO,36epmy,derb8412,2,Mon May 18 21:24:48 2015 UTC,This was a great layman's description of the workings!
springfieldMO,36epmy,Crashes556,6,Wed May 20 20:53:18 2015 UTC,"Since there seems to be some confusion. I only found out about this through the LP website and the Wikipedia page. I wasn't aware of the non-political nature of American (or at least Missourian) mayoral offices, since here in the UK (where I am) the mayoral position is really politicised and hotly contested where they are directly elected. I figured it'd be the same there.   Its odd that hes listed as one though if they're supposed to be non-political, is that illegal?"
springfieldMO,36epmy,Crashes556,2,Mon May 18 20:43:50 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what wouldn't be political about being mayor. As a libertarian mayor he volunteers as mayor and isn't paid. He is compensated $200.00 a month for gas and trips to Jefferson city on behalf of representing Springfield. As it should be for every city. I wonder how many libertarians we have in Springfield? Anytime I tell someone I am a libertarian they are either confused or think I mean liberal.
springfieldMO,36epmy,jaszhix,2,Mon May 18 23:03:09 2015 UTC,"Haha, I know what you mean. At my old job I had a coworker say he was a libertarian and later he said that he admired communism. I slowly stopped talking to him after awhile."

springfieldMO,366ex0,treslor,6,Sat May 16 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"That's probably because the optometrist is an indepent doctor, while the eyeglasses are sold and owned by Walmart"

What they aren't required to give you is your Pupilary Distance, but this can be easily measured yourself or through a tool like the Warby Parker website has.   I've ordered from both zennioptical and warby parker and have ordered online for years now, definitely the way to go! Also, assuming you measure correctly and are a grown adult, your PD won't change.   Edit: Walmart is cheap and hassle free btw"

I did end up getting my lenses there, but I could have just as easily walked out.  No complaints about the exam, and only good things to say about their customer service in the glasses selling part of the store, too -- the fit lady was very clear about how I could come back at any time to get my glasses readjusted for my wonky ears, because they'll do that even if you didn't buy your frames there.  They say their exams are ""a $45 value"" in their blurbs about the two pairs for $69.95 deal, so I assume that's the going rate."

I love the natural beauty of the ozarks, I like the people. We have some racists and drug dudes, but my marriage was interracial, and I never got any shit from it. Even the most backwoods, conservative guys I know have been cool about stuff like that. They seem to really have a problem with gays though, which sucks.  Being a liberal here is like being in a secret club where the secret handshake is looking at others and rolling your eyes when someone starts talking about how Obama is a Muslim or how welfare is killing America. But there are actually plenty of organizations and even churches that are for liberal people who care about gay rights and equality.  The traffic in SGF is bullshit. Total bullshit. You have a combination of old retirees who go 10 miles under, college kids who want to go 10 over, motorcycles who zip in between lines of traffic and then get indignant when they almost get hit, and people from small towns who still think they are in a village where they are the only ones on the road."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,vainamo-,4,Thu May 14 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"Heh, I enjoyed your version of being a liberal in SGF.  Well-put.  I think that to be able to live in SGF on one's own terms, it requires a degree more creativity than in other cities.  If you want to hang out with liberals and have great conversations, then my go-to spots are the farmer's market, events at the library, Millsaps pizza farm Thursdays, Mudhouse, First Friday Artwalk, the Moxie, a range of nonprof activities that you can get tuned in to by joining their email lists, etc. I could think of a TON more too. You'll find the same crowd tending to be at a lot of these events, so it turns into a pretty cool community.  If you hate the traffic, you have to learn the side roads.  I hate the traffic so I know the best roads to avoid it. East-west its Sunset, Portland,  Grand, Walnut, Chestnut or Commercial are usually my go-tos.  North-South is trickier and almost varies by block, since some sections of Campbell and National are good (and some are terrible). There's a learning curve to avoiding traffic but it's entirely possible.  For cyclists, it gets more complicated but totally worth it not having to cross crazy intersections or ride down dangerous streets.  The biggest trick I think is learning where to go to explore the Ozarks.  It's easier than ever to go out and explore when everyone else is happy to sit glued to their TV sets.  Great hiking trails, camping, swimming, fishing, caving, foraging, cycling, hunting, floating, bike touring, target practicing, music festivaling, etc etc.  Best to make friends with a native who can show you good spots off the beaten path, and they're rarely very far from town."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,daveinacave,3,Thu May 14 16:00:46 2015 UTC,"I do the side-roads thing too. It helps that the town is just a grid. As long as you don't hit one of those stupid parts where they take a chunk out of the grid to keep through traffic to a minimum...  I've been going to all the conservation areas in the few counties around town. There are tons of them, and there's always something worth looking at."

On commercial there is that Lebanese place and cafe cuso (sp?) which is Peruvian I think.   I wish we had a Filipino place.

What do I think of Springfield?  First of all it's a nice place to live:  low cost of living, low crime, it's clean, people are extremely friendly and seem genuinely focused on bettering their communities.    Yes, the city is run mostly by and for the benefit of the Assemblies of God Church and Christians in general, but that's not really a bad thing is it?  Christians are good to their neighbors, they don't party until the wee hours, they turn the other cheek, you can trust them with your kids (usually).  And you always know where to find them on Sunday morning.    Springfield's seedy underbelly isn't all that seedy.  A few homeless people, I think, give the downtown area character.  There are many alternatives for homeless and displaced people though, The Kitchen Mission is a great example.  In the 30 years I've known the Kitchen, they have grown and provided countless opportunities for the poor and homeless.  They deserve an award of some kind, because they do fantastic things and allow their clients to achieve fantastic things.    There's a little club scene, there's a little punk scene, there's a little biker scene and a little hippie scene.  These little niche communities co-exist and contribute a diverse mixture of arts and entertainment.  Are those communities as large as other big cities?  Probably not, but who cares? They are every bit as talented and they are made up of the same good people as the rest of the city.    Springfield:  A nice city for nice people."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,brainkandy87,9,Wed May 13 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, the city is run mostly by and for the benefit of the Assemblies of God Church and Christians in general, but that's not really a bad thing is it?

And you always know where to find them on Sunday morning.    Yes, that is a bad thing. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, whatever religion or belief it is in relation to a higher power should not be involved in the running of a city."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,Maxwyfe,8,Wed May 13 18:46:36 2015 UTC,I feel like there is some confusion between running a city by Christian people who (should) adhere to Christian principles with a city that is run according to the tenets of Christianity.  There is no city ordinance saying you have to go to church on Sunday.  There is no city ordinance saying you have to pray to God.  People with those little fish symbols on their car don't get preferential parking.    What we have is a city where smoking is outlawed and bars close at 1:00 a.m.  Talk to someone from Baghdad about a religious state and then quitcherbitchin.'
springfieldMO,35u1vl,brainkandy87,11,Wed May 13 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"You're right, there is no city ordinance saying I have to be at A church on Sunday at B time. You're absolutely correct. You yourself said, however, that the city is run by and for the benefit of a church, but let's boil that down and focus on Christianity. Here's the issue: when a city is ran for the benefit of a specific religion and their beliefs, it leaves everyone else out. We just saw this with the non-discrimination ordinance. You had church leaders preaching to their fucking congregation that they needed to go vote a specific way. In no way whatsoever should any religion be able to do that, to influence voters with their religious position."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,Maxwyfe,10,Wed May 13 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"Not only preaching to their congregation, there were people fighting to repeal the ordinance who were flagrantly breaking federal election laws all over town and the city didn't do anything to stop them."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,brainkandy87,-3,Wed May 13 19:33:03 2015 UTC,"A preacher preaching against an ordinance is not the city council making it illegal to be gay in Springfield.  That's a minister with a large congregation swaying his flock to vote according to his beliefs.  I don't agree with it.  I don't go to that church.  I dislike that church and much of their practices, but what that guy does in his own pulpit is between him and Jesus."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,Maxwyfe,7,Wed May 13 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"No, it's not between him and Jesus. Jesus has nothing to do with city government. Leaders of local churches do."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,SupALupRT,-2,Wed May 13 19:54:24 2015 UTC,"I believe it's also against the law to endorse a particular candidate or issue from the pulpit, although that may just be a requirement that a 501(c) organization not participate in political lobbying or electioneering.  So I guess, it's not just between him and Jesus, it's between him and Jesus and the IRS.     Again, that's not the city government endorsing or advocating an issue, that is a church leader in his own church."

The problem is when someone wants special tax exempt status the their organization under the ideal that it is a religious institution, however it instead gets used as a political machine.  If the AoG wants to pay taxes, I wouldn't care what they told the congregation to vote for."

You're referring to the recently repealed city ordinance  that made discrimination based on sexuality or gender identity in housing against the law.  Upsetting to be sure, but hardly oppressive."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,turbulance4,6,Wed May 13 19:21:39 2015 UTC,uh....I have friends who are LGBT who have been abused and threatened at work. Just the fact that they haven't been murdered isn't a reason to pat yourself on the back about Springfield's diversity.
springfieldMO,35u1vl,Maxwyfe,-1,Wed May 13 19:27:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, being abused and threatened at work because of your sexuality is a crime.  It's a state crime (harassment and/or assault) and against federal law (EEOC).  That makes it already against the law.  Just because something is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't happen obviously.  Isolated incidents like that are not evidence of an overall policy of violence against LGBT people.  I also know LGBT people who are very happy here and haven't encountered any discrimination because of their sexual preference. That ordinance has zero affect on the treatment of LGBT persons in housing or under any other circumstances."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,jestax,6,Wed May 13 19:46:43 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're trying to tell me these things are against the law. You're the one trying to claim we treat LGBT people well in Springfield. I can give you plenty of examples where we don't that don't even have anything to do with the ordinance.   They're not isolated incidents. They happen way too often to be considered isolated incidents. I even know straight people who have dealt with shit like this because they appeared to be gay.   I'm sorry if I'm coming off like a dick but you are so completely off base here.
springfieldMO,35u1vl,var23,-2,Wed May 13 19:49:56 2015 UTC,I'm saying it's already against the law for your friends to be abused.  We don't disagree on that point.    I'm saying the general population is friendly.    I'm saying the city population is a Christian majority and the makeup of the city government reflects that.  And I'm saying living around a lot of Christians is not a bad thing because they are usually nice people.  They aren't perfect and sometimes they are super screwed up and wrong.
springfieldMO,35u1vl,buriedcompass,8,Wed May 13 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think the general population is friendly, otherwise the ordinance wouldn't have been repealed. I think you think the general population is friendly because you're isolated from discrimination from various factors. That's called privilege.   Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's Christians that are at fault. There are plenty of homophobic people that don't go to church. I definitely don't like to see scapegoating based around religion. that being said, James River Assembly definitely has sketchy views on homosexuality which definitely influence the general population."
springfieldMO,35u1vl,espressowhiterussian,11,Wed May 13 20:08:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. A bit of an overreaction to speak like this city is literally run by the church.

springfieldMO,357xnc,onechicgeek,1 point,Fri May 8 00:58:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to tell a story here that I am not particularly proud of.  In February we decided to buy a new truck.  We shopped around and found one we loved.  One problem, it is 2wd.  I asked my husband, ""How often have you used 4wd on the current truck?""  He says maybe 6 times in 10 years.  The salesman and I talk him into the 2wd because it looks great and because it's much cheaper than the 4wd model.    The next weekend it snowed.  The truck spun out and had to be pulled out of an icy, snowy spot.  It kept snowing and then it rained.  In March, husband and his friends head to the woods to stake out turkey hunting locations and site in rifles.  Those woods are located on a friend's property and requires a short drive across an open field.  Well, you can guess what happened.  Weeks of rain and snow turned the field into a mucky mire and that brand new truck got stuck in the mud. Much to his chagrin he had to be pulled out by a friend with a 4wd and a winch for the second time in six weeks.    Keep your 4wd."
springfieldMO,357xnc,vainamo-,1 point,Fri May 8 11:52:16 2015 UTC,"This was my first winter with 4WD and I loved it. I got by in the past without it, even when I lived in Marshfield and commuted to Springfield, but it definitely came in useful on the days when the world looked like an ice skating rink.  The main thing you need to know about the weather is that it changes, rapidly. I don't pack away all my sweatshirts/jackets in summer - I leave a lightweight and medium weight one out. I keep a pair of capris in the closet during fall/winter. Sometimes it'll be 70 degrees and there'll be a foot of snow the next day (happened in 2000). Sometimes the temperature will change by forty degrees in a single day. Sometimes we have storms that would be called hurricanes if they were on the coast. This area is in the perfect spot between the cold air of Canada and the warm air from the Gulf, and I've heard we're officially the most changeable weather in the US."
springfieldMO,355o5z,ryushi612,10,Thu May 7 09:07:19 2015 UTC,"Depending on which direction you'll be driving in from, there are a bunch of trail segments, miniature lakes & other hokey shit just a minute's tick off the highway:   To the Northwest there is Ritter Springs Park, the Frisco Highline Trail & Fantastic Caverns. Directly North you can find McDaniel Lake, Fulbright Spring Park (& walking trail) & Fellows Lake Eastward you can find Compton Hollow Conservation Area; it's pretty remote but there is an archery range, in case you're packing. Also, the James River snakes down through most of Greene, Webster & Wright counties & is a blast to kayak on. Got a free day? Money to blow? Rent one, buy some straps & park your car @Springfield Lake. Then call a taxi, lash the boat on & have them drive you to a good entry point. Maybe here, here, or even here. If you end up in the Southeast, you can always stop for a stroll through the Nature Center. The Visitor's Building offers amazing treasures like air-conditioning, stuffed raccoons & free moss samples(while supplies last)! Further out, there is also the Christian, Taney & Ozark county portion of the Mark Twain National Forest. To the South is the aformentioned Busiek, Two Rivers Mountain Bike Park, & Hidden Valley Golf Links. I don't enjoy golfing but this region is especially lovely. Now, Southwest of town is the Wilson's Creek National Battlefield, as well as the longer stretches of the Ozarks Greenway Trail--really fun to bike or board on if you're into that. Say you started in Nathanael Greene Park & rode all the way out to Power Station No.2; that's only 10-12 miles there & back. But, considering the hills & turns of the trail, you should still get a good workout. I know some people on this sub do this so they can chime in if they feel like it. There's also the Mizumoto Stroll Garden next to the park which is just a relaxing place in general.   I'm sure there's more that I'm forgetting but I have to run.

They quoted me an estimate that was $400 more than the other two estimates I got from other garages.   On top of that, I had a small crack on the interior plastic molding behind my driver's side door handle. The handle itself worked completely fine, the crack was purely cosmetic. Their mechanic ripped the entire plastic shell out from behind the handle and broke the handle in the process, and they didn't even have the courage to admit to me that there was a problem - they left me to find it for myself.   They did eventually offer to pay for the repair of the handle, but they made me fight for it."

springfieldMO,3515ob,rkl22447,2,Wed May 6 18:50:09 2015 UTC,Cox and Mercy are giant corporations who can afford to be overcharged on maintenance. If you think they're worried about the bottom line on some ambulance repairs then you've never had a family member have an overnight stay with them.
springfieldMO,3515ob,utilitybelt,-1,Thu May 7 03:01:43 2015 UTC,Bitch about expensive car repairs bitch about expensive health care. All I'm saying is some things are worth paying to get the best. Next time you get sick why don't you just go to the vet then

Neither Cox nor Mercy is ""the best,"" not in this state, this nation or the world.

springfieldMO,33zw4v,JKtheSlacker,0,Mon Apr 27 13:05:09 2015 UTC,"Mediacom seems like a pretty decent value for 50mbs speeds, but the two year contract, with the guaranteed lower rate for the first year, and no mention of what it balloons to is definitely off putting.   Does mediacom allow you to use your own modem? I was unable to find a list of approved modems on their site."
springfieldMO,33zw4v,wheep,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:23:28 2015 UTC,"Mediacom works great for me 90% of the time, but often my modem reboots for no reason and then it won't connect for an hour or 2.  Also, there are different kinds of DOCSIS 3.0 modems, some are 4 channel, some are 8 channel.  I have an SB6121 which is only 4 channel, but the one Slacker below mentioned, the SB6141 is 8 channels, I'm no expert though.  Maybe /u/AnonMediacomTech can comment and tell us if the amount of channels actually makes a difference for Mediacom, if so I may get an 8 channel one, although I'm already maxed out for my plan (50 Mbps) so I'm not sure what difference it would make."
springfieldMO,33zw4v,AnonMediacomTech,3,Thu Apr 30 12:13:57 2015 UTC,"K, sorry I took so long.  The number of DOCSIS channels a modem is capable of bonding together only determines its max speed. With overhead and reality each channel is capable of a little over 30Mbps (42 theoretical, 38 with overhead, but less when reality is taken into account). So for our 105Mbps service you have to have at least 4 channels. the 150 requires >4 which means an 8 channel modem. Keep in mind that max speed is still determined by what you are provisioned for, based upon what level of service you purchase from us. An 8 channel modem on 15Mbps service won't get ~240Mbps.  Unless you're seriously looking to get >105Mbps service from us in the next 12-24 months (or it's only an extra $10), I wouldn't bother with an 8 channel modem over a 4 channel. I suspect that DOCSIS 3.1 is going to roll out sooner rather than later in which case ""future proofing"" by buying an 8 channel modem will have been a waste of money. 3.1 uses 4096 QAM, much smaller channel widths, and a much larger number of channels to achieve gigabit (and even greater) speeds over coax.  FYI there are also 2 channel and 16 channel DOCSIS 3 modems, 2 channel were the earliest, and 16 are bleeding edge. We don't have any plant that I am aware of that is currently using more than 8 downstreams however."

springfieldMO,33slbu,RedditYeti,3,Sat Apr 25 05:30:26 2015 UTC,There's a spot in Arkansas about 2.5 hours frm spfld called SAMs rock. It's in mount Judea ark. And it's freaking beautiful! One of my personal favorites. A little out of the way but worth it.
springfieldMO,33slbu,starrtokes,2,Sat Apr 25 13:58:27 2015 UTC,There's a rock climb there which inspired my username.

springfieldMO,33slbu,WendyArmbuster,3,Sat Apr 25 18:38:37 2015 UTC,"I've hiked the Appalachian Trail, the Teton Crest Trail, and a ton of other places across America, but my favorite trail for backpacking is the Ozark Highland Trail.  No question.  It is really well laid out, although food drops and shuttles are sort of a hassle.  I also really like the Buffalo River Trail, but the scenery, while awesome, is not quite as diverse as the OHT.  Recently in my life I've gotten into car camping, and Erbie on the Buffalo has become one of my favorites."

There are trails with clearings along the way that are great for camping.   If you literally meant campground, my family frequented Compton Ridge when I was a kid.  It's just outside of Branson.  They have extensive facilities and some nature trails. Definitely not primitive camping though."

They have a FB page where they announce when berries are ready.  They are  crazy delicious and I would pay attention to good timing on this one if you are interested. Maybe ready in a couple weeks?  Blueberries-  good patch on west FR 124, which is west of the airport.  Address is 10965 S W Farm Rd 124 Bois D'Arc, guy named Bob who is retired and fun to talk to.  I think they are the best around and worth driving to, as the bushes are crammed with berries and it's far enough out of town that it's not as crowded."

The owners were very friendly and I was able to pick 33 pounds of plump delicious berries in a little over an hour."

The Old Wire Road, The Trail of Tears, and Route 66 are all a big part of this city's history. My design focused on how Springfield has become a very central part of the region through it's roads. The offset location in the last options are meant to represent the location of Springfield within Missouri. Graphical inspiration came from the St. Louis and Chicago flags, because they are both pretty great. I had a hard time choosing colors though, blue could be for water from our many rivers and streams or the open sky, green could be for the many forests around us, red white and blue to reflect the American and Missouri flags.

springfieldMO,33owd8,skylergreene,8,Fri Apr 24 08:18:08 2015 UTC,"Do not play at Nathan P. Murphy's unless its your only option. As IOnlyEatMeat points out, it's got a few problems. It's a big brick room so it's going to make you sound really bad. Their PA is garbage. The manager lady treats bands very unprofessionally. I've personally witnessed her cut the PA while a touring band played just because she decided the show should end. They're also sketchy with money. I've been to shows there where the bar was packed only for them to pay out a couple bucks per band (yes seriously) because ""we didn't make anything tonight.""   Nathan P Murphys also charges a big minor charge so you're probably not gonna get anyone under 21 to see you.  The Outland/Outland Ballroom is probably the best spot in town if you can get in there. Unless you're talking about cover acts and old people music, the Outland/Outland Ballroom are the most professionally ran venues here. The bartenders/managers try and take care of bands as best as they can. Get on Facebook and look up a guy named Jimmy Kochs, he runs both those spots and he's the guy to talk to about getting a show there.   Honestly, speaking as someone who is semi-active playing music here and getting back into the game, your best bet is to not worry about specific venues. No place here is gonna make or break you. You should try to contact specific bands  that you think would fit your music over Facebook. Venues here largely don't really promote shows at all unless it's for a huge band with a giant guarantee. The bigger drawing local shows in our scene are because the local bands got stoked on someone and promoted. If you leave it up to the venues, you're probably gonna end up playing to the locals and their significant others.    I can't really speak of anyone to hit up specifically for your style of music but if you go to this facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/308857825896/ you might be able to find someone to help out."
springfieldMO,33owd8,Cold417,4,Fri Apr 24 17:33:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoroughness! Your reply was very helpful. I'm joining your group now, contacting Kochs, and will hopefully find some local bands to connect with in the near future!  I've played at the Outland Ballroom once before with Randall Shreve & The Sideshow, and had a really positive experience! Hopefully I can get in with my own band.  At this point, money isn't our largest focus.  It would be nice to make gas money back to Fayetteville/Mtn. Home, but other than that, we're just trying to establish a solid 300 mile circuit to rotate on throughout the year.  As far as promotion, we're pretty proactive. We make our own posters, flier before the event, incessantly spam massive Facebook campaigns, and organize at least 1 live radio interview.    What is your band? Maybe there would be room for show swapping between us in the future?"
springfieldMO,33owd8,IOnlyEatMeat,3,Fri Apr 24 19:39:27 2015 UTC,I would definitely say The Outland Bar/Outland Ballroom/Front of House is your best bet for a good draw.  I usually don't visit other venues unless I know the artist...but at those 3 I usually have a good time no matter who's playing.
springfieldMO,33owd8,IOnlyEatMeat,4,Fri Apr 24 17:00:23 2015 UTC,Outland seems to be held in the highest regard by most of the people I've been talking to.  Thank you so much for your input.

springfieldMO,33nwjp,TeamDas1,3,Fri Apr 24 01:35:58 2015 UTC,"Avoid going to any of these ""no credit needed"" or ""instant approval"" places, e.g. Car-Mart, etc. They sell you a car for far more than it's worth.  Check the larger dealerships around town, you can find some pretty decent deals in the range you're looking at. They won't have an incredible selection at that price range, but it's a starting point. You can also try eBay Motors, not sure how wide the selection will be for Springfield, but it's a good place to get a used car.  Another option you probably haven't even looked at is the classifieds in the local papers. I know, it's totally old school, but there's still a large section of the population that has always used classifieds in the paper like we use Craigslist.  Before you say yes to buying a car, go check out its value with Edmunds used car appraiser. Don't overpay! That is my biggest advice. When you really need something, there's a tendency to be okay with overpaying just to get it. You're dropping a large amount of cash on something that will have little resale value for you in the future, so make sure you get as much as you can for your money.  Happy hunting!"

Thus I had already figured out 2 were definitely voting for anyone but me unless they were openly pro gay rights because 2 members are hard line christian right and I believe in more of trying to find a balance until the higher courts find a national solution.

I  talked to her one night and she was very friendly.  She remembered my grandfather and his butcher shop next door to the El Taco on Kearney.  She also sold me the last of an odd Villa tshirt at discounted price.
springfieldMO,33fam7,TheWads,3,Wed Apr 22 16:56:48 2015 UTC,Well I neither choose to nor knew who she was originally.  Over the last 2 years I had never seen her once at any of the luncheons or anything until she showed up to give her presentation to the council for the seat.  I learned who she was after she dropped her application 3 weeks after mine and I researched her name but I do not find being a peasant facing a noble reason to back out.  I'll at least fight and go down properly.

I'm not going to provide any proof because I don't need to.  I'm an engineer and work in the field, you don't have to believe me if you don't want but that isn't how electricity and meters work.  Sure, you can hack a meter and tell if electricity is being used and use that info to assume a person is home or not, so I'm not saying all privacy concerns are bogus but you can't tell what is turned on or which room the TV is being watched in..."

Here are her thoughts: Everything the paranoid people say about AMI is false. AMI systems do not spy on people, it tracks usage and diagnostics...it does not cause mass layoffs at utilities...jobs are eliminated through attrition. The RF will not cook your brain...the transmitters on the meters emit less RF than a cellphone. In other words the science does not back up the general conspiracy claims.  She recommends this article:  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061514003743  You can also reference the bigger AMI companies websites; Sensus, Landis+Gyr, and Silver Springs."

The electric companies have been able to do this for quite some time. The infrastructure of a grid power network is capable of relaying information just the same as a computing network infrastructure. Early renditions of the Internet worked solely off the backbone of power grids. If CU wanted too they would not even require ""meter readers"" they could get all this information just by simply pulling the information from the meter boxes over their already established infrastructure. This is simply another reason for them to say ""Hey, we have a new technology and we are going to charge you more because of it."""

My nieces birthday party was held there -- not sure how much it costs to rent tho. Also a few of the fire stations have big rooms (includes tables n chairs) you can rent for really cheap. A friend of mine had her sons birthday party there, the kids really loved looking at the fire trucks and the firemen were really sweet letting them try on their hats etc. So if you have a little boy he might get a kick out of that."

springfieldMO,32gdvg,blu3dice,3,Mon Apr 13 16:41:38 2015 UTC,"awww :) good. Like I said, I know the fee to rent the room is really small but worth it considering you get the space and chairs/tables. Plus the pure entertainment value kids get out of seeing the trucks and equipment. We got a cute photo of all the kids in front of the truck with a few of the firemen. Just be sure to call and reserve the room with plenty of time. I hope its a great party!"

Apparently it is an expansive thing but takes about a  half mile to mile walk from the entrance to get under the mall but once there you can hear the echos of all the activity from up above resonating through the cave.  Also i had to spend the better part of a shift chasing some bats that came up into the mall until they were tired enough to be caught and released into a proper, non-human inhabited habitat."

springfieldMO,329i0x,turbulance4,4,Mon Apr 13 22:39:02 2015 UTC,Them having shows also was a problem. That space was simply not set up to have shows downstairs. It'd get so crowded so buying drinks was hard and the music sounded so bad compared to other places. you'd see a local band play there and sound terrible but then sound great at the outland on another night.  I think that possibly drove away some people that would love their concept. Lots of people who wanna play old school arcade games probably don't wanna hear indie bands or DJs.

springfieldMO,327bln,zargonn,6,Sat Apr 11 05:10:14 2015 UTC,"We may be wading through layer upon layer of intolerance here, but I do think progress is being made.  I'm currently a resident of Branson, and my sexual orientation is straight, but I was really hoping the legislation would go through to help protect the rights of our gay or bi community.  I'm disappointed in the residents of Springfield for failing to do that, but again, I have hope that we can change that closed-minded view of the LGBT community here in the Ozarks.

If you read the report the council released about this, they said that they knew the language of the bill would probably anger church leaders and that they would petition it to a popular vote. I think it's really irresponsible to have even let that happen without trying to avert it. It's not something the public should be arguing about."

I get that many of you are pretty cynical, but I actually think that people are more accepting than you'd believe. Let each business handle this on their own as it arises- laws are just going to get in the way. In practice, the guy in the picture would clearly just walk into the men's bathroom and there'd be no problems and no one would even know he's transgender. Business should handle this on the small community level. I think most of the time they would be accepting and allow a transgender person to use the most appropriate bathroom of their choosing. But then they still hold the right to keep someone who is falsely claiming to 'feel like a woman' from entering and harassing people, since it's their private business. I think laws on this topic would just complicate things a lot and make the situation worse for everyone."
springfieldMO,323q27,votealt58,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"laws are just going to get in the way.   Because trans people get harassed in the bathroom.  All. The. Time.  And there is absolutely no resource for filing a complaint.   In practice, the guy in the picture would clearly just walk into the men's bathroom and there'd be no problems and no one would even know he's transgender.   Just because someone doesn't have the ability (read: luck via genetics and age of transition) to look like Michael Hughes, doesn't mean they should be treated differently than he does.  The way things are basically allows for business owners to ignore the ""good"" trans people and abuse the ones they don't think look good enough.   I think most of the time they would be accepting and allow a transgender person to use the most appropriate bathroom of their choosing.   Trans people are caught in a delicate balancing act of which bathroom to go to, based upon which side of the gender spectrum they want to be abused by.  This is not a whim, but a matter of safety and identity.   But then they still hold the right to keep someone who is falsely claiming to 'feel like a woman' from entering and harassing people, since it's their private business.   It's always been a possibility for someone to walk straight into the bathroom and claim this.  Why do you think people are going to suddenly beat down the door, 'pretending to be a woman?'  And why is it always women that we're afraid of people 'pretending' to be?  When I use the restroom, there's literally a row of bathroom stalls and no one can tell what kind of genitals you have unless they're peeking in those stalls.  If you've got someone who harassing other patrons, regardless of whether they're actually trans, that's plenty of reason to kick them out of your establishment."

This is exactly why we don't need laws about this. Show me evidence there is significant amounts of harassment being perpetuated towards trans people in the bathroom. I might change my opinion. But all my life of going to the men's bathroom I can't recall a single time I've ever seen anyone harass anyone in there and I've seen some pretty strange looking fellows in bathrooms. But everyone is just there to do one thing and get out, no one is really paying any attention to anyone else. Maybe it's different in women's rooms, I don't know."
springfieldMO,323q27,votealt58,1 point,Mon Apr 13 07:16:12 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why we don't need laws about this.   Well, it's currently not against any law or anything to kick a transgender individual out of a bathroom or a business. I'm also pretty sure it's actually possible to attempt to press sexual harassment charges, which is what's traditionally been done in the past for these kinds of situations.   So, basically, when I use the women's facilities I have to hope and pray I don't run into someone who wants to make a scene. And I typically don't. But it is a possibility that exists. And I rank that possibility kind of high when there's a very loud vocal group yelling about how I, and people like me, are sexual predators.   Fun times.    Show me evidence there is significant amounts of harassment being perpetuated towards trans people in the bathroom.    Well, there's this big sign. Not quite bathroom harassment, but I'm pretty sure we all agree on what they're implying there. No one here is stupid.   There's also the recent Planet Fitness story where a woman complained about a transwoman using the womens facilities and was trying to get her removed.   And then we can move on to talking about places that are pushing the other way such as Texas, Kentucky, and Florida which want to put laws on the book specifically making it illegal for trans people to use the facilities of their identified (and usually presented as) gender. Granted, it's not happening here, but there seems to be a shared mentality among the proponents of such things.   As a transgender woman living in the surrounding community... I haven't been harassed. But that doesn't mean I won't be, and I have little recourse if I am. So it's something I have to take into account. Collectively getting together and agreeing ""You know, maybe we shouldn't discriminate in housing and employment based on sexual orientation or gender identity"" goes a long way towards telling a section of your community that you're actually cool with them."
springfieldMO,323q27,ChromiumGirl,2,Mon Apr 13 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"And didn't the woman who complained at the Planet Fitness get kicked out and banned from the facility, not the transgender person? I think that kind of proves my point that these things can work out naturally on their own without interfering laws. I'm glad that you haven't been harassed. If you ever are, complain to the business. Like you said, you could try a sexual harassment angle. I know you might be cynical but I bet most of the time the business will side with you if you're respectful and they will try to remedy the situation. And if they aren't, then screw them. Don't go back there and encourage everyone you know to not go there either.  I think discrimination laws in general are kind of sad things to have to have. They should only be necessary when there is a real systemic problem significantly holding a group of people back (aka blacks in the 1950s). But if there isn't systemic discrimination occurring, we shouldn't put more discrimination laws on the books 'just in case'. Any law can be abused and it would probably just open up a huge can of worms. (e.g. people who aren't really transgender trying to use it to win a lawsuit or take down a business they don't like)"

Back in 2004 while attending OTC, I was befriended by a guy I meet in class. He was months away before he started his transition. There were no doctors in Spfd at the time that treated trans people and before you can start hormones or get any sort of surgery you have to be cleared by a therapist (sometimes taking up to a year) --- so every 6-8 weeks he had to drive to Colorado just for a hour long doctors appt (missing school and work because its a long journey). For him it was 9 months before he was cleared ""mentally competent"" to make this decision --- I guess then and maybe still now Doctors think on an emotional whim people would want to change their sex. Then he started hormone treat.   It was amazing how fast this transformation was. When 2-3 months his voice started changing, was growing a small amount of facial hair....and fast forward 6 months and his voice was totally changed and had a full 5 o'clock shadow. By a year his actual body shape had changed, wider hips were replaced with huge shoulders and a lot of muscles on his chest and upper arms. 1.5 year into testosterone injections on appearance he was a man. It was around this time that my nosey self asked a few personal questions out of curiosity ----- but yeaaah the testosterone even changes the ""bits and pieces"".     It was till about 6 months later that he was approved to have surgery to remove his breasts and that for him was the final step in his process. For years he suffered extreme depression and shared that in high school he was even suicidal. He felt like he was born into a foreign body. That from early on in his memory he felt like he was being punished. None of the other boys had to wear dresses, have long hair, start menstruating and grow breasts. Really for him life finally started at the age of 26. He is married now and from donated sperm has two kids with his wife.   Anyways your comment just reminded me of him with fond thoughts. He's an amazing person with a lot of strength."

As pictured, we end up forced into choosing to either follow the law or freak out the gender muggles.   I think a lot of the proponents of the bathroom stuff only have 1 image of a trans person; that of some older male looking individual in a bad wig and a dress. They don't know of (or if malicious, conveniently forget) all the transmen wandering around as well as the younger transitioners, who if really lucky, do it before puberty and you'd never know.   If all of us were to follow such a law, like good little law abiding citizens, the above pictured would happen. Then a predator wouldn't even need to take extra steps to enter the women's facilities (where proponents are frequent to remind us, are also children) they could just walk right on in under the pretense of being a transman. When just a clipboard will get you into almost anywhere, this scenario is frighteningly plausible.   And then there's all those younger transwomen who are forced into the mens room...

Personally I'm not ashamed or embarrassed, although I am disappointed in my community.   I'm disappointed as someone who follows politics that so few of us understand the difference between opinion and law. I have plenty of opinions, and would like them respected as much as anyone. It is my right to express them.   I'm even within my rights to say ""it is my opinion that people who have committed no crime be treated differently in the eyes of the law."" But the fact that we have taken that opinion and codified it into law goes against our better nature. As an American who loves the constitution and believes in rights for all- even people I don't like, that saddens me.   I'm disappointed that people have such strong opinions on something that so few of them actually researched.  To talk to people you'd think this was an act regulating florists, bakeries and restroom policies. That's like saying WWII was a battle fought over the island of Guam. It was, but that's only a fraction of the whole.   This was a measure to remove civil protections from gay and lesbian individuals in the areas of employment, housing and public accommodations. Hard-working people will lose their jobs over this. Good, dependable people will lose their homes over this. Quiet people who only want to be left alone will think twice before going out to get a meal together because of this.    Have you ever wondered if it was safe to hold a loved one's hand over dinner? Will they kick you out? Some of your neighbors have to ask themselves that.   Have you ever considered lying about your significant other's name when a co-worker asks, for fear of jeopardizing a job you need? That's something gay people live with.   Ever go look at an apartment and ask your wife to stay home so the landlord can't see her? You gotta live somewhere. These are decisions your fellow taxpaying citizens have had to make for some time, and they will go on making them because of measures like this.   As a Christian, this doesn't feel like loving the sinner and hating the sin to me. Being a decent human and loving people I disagree with isn't compromising my faith. It is the core of my faith.   I'm also disappointed in how the discussion was conducted. People did anything they could to obfuscate the nature of the repeal. They painted an image of gays as skulking perverts sneaking into women's restrooms, forcing shopkeepers to create offensive cakes for them and calling in the big bad gubmint when they won't. We had the equality law for six months, and how many times did that happen? Zip.   The truth is that these aren't the cartoonish, frightening, wild people you're imagining. The repeal campaign did a frankly masterful job of discussing gays in terms that implies all these terrible things without ever having to sum up the courage to do it openly.   Long story short, I'm disappointed because our city has done a great harm to a lot of good people for all the wrong reasons.  These are people you'd probably never fire, evict or publicly shame if you had to look them in the eye to do it.   Fortunately, you didn't have to look them in the eye, did you?"
springfieldMO,31vxad,KabIoski,3,Wed Apr 8 19:32:19 2015 UTC,"All that being said, do you think that a person who voted ""yes"" is a bad person?"
springfieldMO,31vxad,KabIoski,11,Wed Apr 8 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"No. I think the yes voters are probably good people who have done a great harm to many of their neighbors for all the wrong reasons.   I have friends on both sides, and its always easier to argue against a cartoonish image than real people.  The people who voted yes are, in my observance, afraid of that gay cartoon. These people were worried about RuPaul striding into their muffler shop, not my brother or his husband. If they had to look someone in the eye and see they were regular everyday people before firing, shaming or evicting them, I'd have my doubts about whether they were good. But they didn't.   The yes voters aren't the shotgun-waving hillbillies people on the left think anymore than the gay people are the restroom-skulking child abusers the yes campaign was so careful to describe.   Of course those gay people lost a lot of their rights as Americans over the vote, while others had to cope with the pain of impolitely expressed opinions, so its not exactly the same on both sides."
springfieldMO,31vxad,KabIoski,0,Wed Apr 8 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"What about people who voted Yes purely because they believe in the rights of business owners?

What would you say to those people?"
springfieldMO,31vxad,KabIoski,14,Wed Apr 8 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"I think that's been a very effective way of discussing it. I'd even buy that argument if it were accurate.   When they change the speed limit on the road I take to work, that's not government seizing more power, that's them changing what they do with it.   The fact is, the government currently has the power to step in and interfere with the rights of a business owner when those rights unfairly deprive certain people of their own rights. Currently people can not discriminate on the basis of race creed, disability, sex, etc. Springfield has a mayors commission on human rights that has the power to investigate infractions. The original act added GLBT people to the list of people protected under established powers. At the end of the day, the government had precisely the same powers they started with.  With the repeal of the act the same is true.   Now if there had been a vote to change the amount of power the government has in some way, I think that would be an accurate argument to make, but in this context it is a way of being in favor of a really harmful change without having to confront the effects of it directly.   How, in non-philosophical, practical terms, do you believe adding gay people to the list of people who can not be fired, evicted or publicly shamed for that reason alone is harmful to a business owner?"

I'm not saying that it will hurt business, as in the business will earn less profit.  I'm saying that it impedes on the rights of the business owner more so than the lgbtq community.  As the lgbtq community isn't being prohibited nor compelled to do anything by law, yet business owners are, my argument is pretty apparent. One group is being forced to do something they don't want to do. The other is not.    I think you stop short of being completely fair.  My definition of fair: no hypocrisy. Which the ordinance was based on."
springfieldMO,31vxad,KabIoski,6,Thu Apr 9 01:36:11 2015 UTC,"So let's say I have a hotel, and I have a policy where black people are not allowed to stay in my hotel, and the government comes along and tells me to knock it off. Are you making the case that my rights have been infringed more than the people I turned away?"
springfieldMO,31vxad,KabIoski,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:12:47 2015 UTC,"The first step in this discussion is to define the term rights.  I've often heard it argued that 'your right to swing your fist stops where my face begins'.  Basically, this society was founded on the idea that you have the right do what you wish as long as it isn't harming or impeding on someone else's right to the same.   In your scenario, the hotel owner; who wishes to have an establishment without serving blacks; is not hurting or impeding on the rights of blacks. Blacks aren't prohibited from staying in hotels as a whole. The hotel owner isn't physically hurting blacks.   If the government steps in and say 'you can't do that, you have to serve everyone'. The hotel owner is then unable to do as he pleases. IE: his right to do as he wishes(without hurting anyone) has been encroached upon in favor of the idea that it is a black person's right to stay in any hotel he wishes(even if the owner doesn't want him).  The idea that it is a black persons right to stay in a place owned by someone who wishes him not to be there is akin to the government not stopping its fist where the hotel owners face begins.  If you spot any hypocrisy or have a different opinion on what rights mean, I'd be interested in it."

Thus why I felt compelled to post the old video and proposal of mine.
springfieldMO,31vpyf,Crashes556,2,Wed Apr 8 19:15:10 2015 UTC,"Some background information:    In order to remain tax-exempt under 501(c)(3), churches must abide by strict guidelines that prohibit election activity. The Code states in relevant part that 501(c)(3) organizations cannot “participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.” I.R.C. Sec. 501(c)(3). Thus, as a 501(c)(3) organization, churches are strictly forbidden from supporting or opposing a candidate for public office. To do so jeopardizes their tax-exempt status. Churches cannot engage in any of the following activities under the federal tax law:    Cannot endorse or oppose candidates for public office Cannot make any communication—either from the pulpit, in a newsletter, or church bulletin—which expressly advocates for the election or defeat of a candidate for public office Cannot make expenditures on behalf of a candidate for public office or allow any of their resources to be used indirectly for political purposes (e.g., use their phones for a phone bank) Cannot ask a candidate for public office to sign a pledge or other promise to support a particular issue Cannot distribute partisan campaign literature Cannot display political campaign signs on church property Under current law, churches, as well as other 501(c)(3) organizations, may engage in nonpartisan campaign activities, primarily consisting of voter education.     Thus, they may organize and coordinate nonpartisan get-out-the-vote and voter registration drives; sponsor nonpartisan candidate debates or forums, so long as all legally qualified candidates are invited to appear and wide spectrum of issues are covered; educate all candidates on issues of public interest; and create legislative scorecards or voter guides. All of these permissible activities must be done on a nonpartisan basis. A 501(c)(3) entity should not even tacitly express favor or disfavor of a particular candidate.   Essentially, referendum issues skirt the IRS guidelimes, so any recent activity regarding the repeal campaign wouldn't really pose a problem.   That said, if anyone has evidence that a local church has violated any of the rules, you can email eoclass@irs.gov and file a complaint. While its true this seldom results in a church losing their tax exemption, having an issue investigated can make a church think twice about abusing their tax exempt status."

We do have a Bill of Rights and a Constitution to see to that.  The civil rights act changed everything, and removed true freedom of association from our ever dwindling list of rights as citizens.  In truth, the civil rights act and all laws following it's style should have simply reaffirmed and more distinctly defined constitutional rights and emphasized that all people regardless of race, creed, color, religion, orientation or any other attribute has the same rights under the Constitution - including freedom of association. If someone is a discriminating twat, don't let them have your money or time.  Instead, it is now this constant power struggle between multiple groups who want to direct where their locales and nation go, instead of being united as a single nation of freedom and peace.   Business owners shouldn't have to bend over backwards to accommodate special interest groups or racial/sexual groups just to stay in legal compliance. Likewise, the smart businessman just let's it all fly and rakes in the profits - but all of that should be a free choice, thanks to the long lost right of freedom to choose who you associate and interact with as an individual and a business owner - that used to be a two way street."
springfieldMO,31tqzg,mslack,11,Wed Apr 8 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"Who was being made to bend over backwards? The law didn't say you had to hire X% gay employees, only that you couldn't discriminate. That's a huge difference."

And the majority went,""nope we need the religious freedom to be able to refuse service, fire, and shun and drive out those queer folk"".  Unsurprisingly, I don't feel particularly welcome or safe doing business in a town that wants to go out of its way to take back the right to hate me.   I do feel sorry though people are upset at loosing the right to discriminate and fought so hard to take it back. I'm sorry because of what it says about this place and what the residents want to turn it into. Maybe in another 7-10 years, another lifetime or so, it'll change. Doubt I'll be around for it. I get the message.   Edit: And apparently the disagreement is strong enough the while no one will actually reply to me and counter point and discuss things I've brought up,  they will however go through my post history and down vote the first page or two of things.

springfieldMO,31tqzg,Zykax,9,Wed Apr 8 04:51:32 2015 UTC,"But as landlords or owners of apartments, unless there is a monopoly (which is another problem that should be addressed), competition who is either sympathetic or just not stupid says ""here, come stay here - we would love to have your business.""   As a result, long term, the non-accomidating landlord ends up losing their rental properties and having to sell to other landlords or competing businesses through attrition.   I just see it like a lot of people do when buying groceries. I'll usually try to shop locally if I can despite higher prices, because I'd rather support local interests than feed the evil machine known as Wal-Mart...etc...but there again is the monopoly problem.  With jobs, there's no way to win in a willful fire state anyway, they just wait for you to mess up or lay you off due to budgetary problems and hire someone cheaper. Of course, never hearing what goes on in behind closed doors with executives, no law can truly protect anyone from being discriminated against when applying and interviewing for a job. As a result the ambiguity can lead to businesses being sued for discrimination when they really just had found someone who suited the job better in many cases. Likewise, those who discriminate tend to be racists and act inappropriately toward minority employees (minority being race or orientation, anything else), and they then suffer the consequences from society and their employees as direct repercussion.  Really though, people think they can legislate equality into existence. The problem is that there's no such thing as true equality at the end of the day - blame the randomness of the universe, nature, the fall of man to sin, or whatever else you like, but it's just the way things are, and that truly will never change.  I'll keep rambling if I don't go to bed...  Another funny thing that I wonder... could a business owner who is black, or Muslim, or gay, sue someone who came in to utilize their services to force them to buy their services, after they left because they found the owner is black/Muslim/gay?  If not, these laws are one sided... I only use this as an illustration to point out how futile and wrong any special protections are, unless you're a bald eagle."

Business owners shouldn't have to bend over backwards to accommodate special interest groups or racial/sexual groups just to stay in legal compliance.   Business owners shouldn't deny someone work just because the name on their birth certificate is masculine, and the person in front of them is feminine.

Think about the big employers here in the Springfield metro (beside Wal-Mart which I'd guess has the largest total amount of employees) and realize it's O'Reilly, Bass Pro and Great Southern. Two retail empires and a regional bank. These places don't pay well for entry level jobs compared to Kansas City which these same type of employment opportunities as well as a greater selection of other industries and is the HQ for a major health technology company. Granted, the cost of living is lower but there isn't a lot to spend your money on either.   I guess a lack of diversity correlates with a lack of culture (or at least the perception of such) and I do understand that but I think the biggest problem is a lack of entry level jobs beyond low pay, high stress paper pushing at O'Reilly or Bass Pro or the very limited availability of interesting jobs in fields like advertising and the like."

I don't even want this repealed for any hokey religious reasons or discrimination but as I've said many times already its a non-issue.

Look at what's going on with radical Muslims right now. Look how religion was used to justify slavery and racism. The only religion I don't think can be used to justify cruelty is Buddhism. But again, religious leaders in this city were trying to persuade their congregation to repeal this bill. I wish people would philosophically reflect on religious beliefs themselves rather than listen to a preacher trying to inflate their own pockets and push hidden agendas."

It works because, hey, if I give a guy 10 dollars for 20 dollars worth of foodstamps, I can justify a little bit of a splurge.  Anyway, this is symbolic.

In St. Louis County, I can put in my address and get a PDF of my exact ballot.  Put in an address in Greene, it just gives you a polling place map.  This is especially helpful when there are different measures/council candidates/judges/etc. within a small radius; you're seeing the ads for all of them, but end up wasting your time looking into the issue/person when it turns out you're not in that district and don't have any say."

springfieldMO,31l8b5,Turtle1515,9,Mon Apr 6 03:14:37 2015 UTC,"Can I have the general opinion here:  Does anyone think there's even a small chance of it not being repealed? I feel like with as conservative as the Ozarks are, the majority are going to vote yes."
springfieldMO,31l8b5,Ayerland,5,Mon Apr 6 03:28:41 2015 UTC,"With what's going on in Indiana I feel like maybe it won't be repealed? I hope not anyway. I don't think Reed has a chance in hell, but I like him."
springfieldMO,31l8b5,akidiknow,2,Mon Apr 6 03:43:01 2015 UTC,I think it will be 50/50.  There is a chance either way.
springfieldMO,31l8b5,fryreportingforduty,3,Mon Apr 6 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"I said this on another thread about the same question:  IMO, it's looking good. The Newsleader published a list of 161 businesses that are in support of the gay rights ordinance. In my neighborhood, there are noticeably more NO signs in front yards than YES. I also attend MSU and the student body is overwhelmingly in support of voting no, including a public statement from the university president saying he will be voting no.  What I believe it will come down to is whether these people actually vote, because it seems like the majority of Springfield residents don't want the ordinance repealed."
springfieldMO,31l8b5,dei2anged,2,Mon Apr 6 14:43:29 2015 UTC,"Students historically do not turn out to vote in Springfield. Even when their polling location was the fire station across the street and it was a presidential election. Or even to raise minimum wage. If registering students to vote was like pulling teeth, then getting them to the polls was like volunteer amputation."
springfieldMO,31l8b5,fryreportingforduty,7,Mon Apr 6 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"The sad truth. I don't have classes Tuesday and I have volunteered to pick up friends and drive them to the polls. So far, 8 friends have taken up the offer."
springfieldMO,31l8b5,dei2anged,2,Mon Apr 6 17:35:40 2015 UTC,You're an awesome friend! I used to work for a group that would drive voters to the polls if they didn't have easy access. It was so depressing to see the turnout rates

But if the fact that I lost a lot of respect for a couple Co workers that made the mistake of blasting their political views on Facebook is anything to go by....yeah."
springfieldMO,31l8b5,dei2anged,3,Mon Apr 6 05:42:33 2015 UTC,Voter turnout in Springfield is absolutely abysmal and for an non presidential election it's even worse. Yesterday was Easter Sunday and plenty of churches in the area told their congregation that not repealing the law would lead to them being sued into nonexistence due to gay weddings/whateverothershitargument
springfieldMO,31l8b5,alg45160,3,Mon Apr 6 11:26:25 2015 UTC,and don't forget...all the child molesters will now be allowed to go into the women's restroom and molest your kids! /s
springfieldMO,31l8b5,dei2anged,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:44:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the arguments in favor are absolutely asinine and rooted in bigotry and fear. That being said, anyone who thinks this ""only has a small chance of repeal"" is likely new to the area. The student population trends liberal, but fewer than 10% of registered student voters even turn out to vote for PRESIDENTIAL elections, and the general Democrat voting base isn't much better turnout wise, maybe 25%.  This is a real election where every single person you get out to the polls matters and typically only the churches, who overwhelmingly vote socially conservative, get people to the polls.   Easter before vote? Check. Gerrymandering reducing easy access to polling locations for lower income and student areas? Check.  Polling locations typically at churches? Check."
springfieldMO,31l8b5,benutne,2,Mon Apr 6 14:24:24 2015 UTC,"The fact that as many as 30,000 people who never go to church any other day than Easter and Christmas went yesterday to have their shithead of a pastor tell them to make sure and vote yes because Jesus = love* makes me worry a lot.    *Except for those faggots.  They deserve to be treated like second class citizens."

On the one hand, you've got a bunch of shop owners with legitimate concerns about being able to run their private businesses how they want to, sprinkled with a small handful of bigoted assholes. Then on the other hand, you've got a lot of people genuinely, and rightfully, concerned that they're being ostracized from society based soley on their sexual preference, and they want protection from that, but those people are also sprinkled with a whole bunch of assholes who liken this shit to segregation and racism all the time (segregation was government mandated, no one is mandating these shop owners refuse people service because they can't: these are privately owned businesses.)  The whole situation is a clusterfuck of retarded and if people would just not fucking talk about who they wanna fuck to strangers, and if people would just not take offense at that the once in a blue moon it DOES happen, none of this would be happening.  Fuck."

springfieldMO,31f0mz,dmmagic,20,Sat Apr 4 13:21:21 2015 UTC,Voting no because I don't want to be fired just because I like girls. This isn't about the stupid bathrooms. That is the only argument I've heard pro-yes. Why actively choose to discriminate against someone you don't know just because they are different than you? It's hurtful and senseless.
springfieldMO,31f0mz,hearip88,7,Sat Apr 4 17:41:09 2015 UTC,I can easily say I have never seen a transgender using a bathroom for the opposite of their (biological) sex. It is such a stupid argument and is obviously just a cover for their desire to discriminate.
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Wrinklestiltskin,2,Sat Apr 4 19:45:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think you would even know. If a fully transitioned person used there bathroom of their biological gender then you would notice. It would just look like a dude in the ladies room, or a lady in the dudes room. Does that make sense? Like it would just be a lady in the dudes room sitting down to pee."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,akidiknow,2,Mon Apr 6 03:48:37 2015 UTC,"Yes that makes sense, but being transgender isn't synonymous with having a sex change or anything (if that was implied). Being transgender has to do with self-identity."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Wrinklestiltskin,3,Mon Apr 6 04:05:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, also they didn't even change the part about bathrooms anyway. Stays the same yes or no. That whole bathroom part is a non issue. Plus, you know. Sec offenders aren't really sticklers for the rules anyway so it wouldn't even matter."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,akidiknow,3,Mon Apr 6 04:19:08 2015 UTC,Yeah the whole bathroom thing is just an excuse to discriminate.
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Wrinklestiltskin,11,Mon Apr 6 04:38:30 2015 UTC,"As a future MSU student and someone who does not get to vote on this, I am begging everyone to go vote against the repeal in my stead. Don't just sit on reddit being disgusted by it, actually go out and vote; you know the people who want to discriminate will be voting. Please do not let my future home move backwards instead of forward."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Evenger14,6,Sun Apr 5 01:11:59 2015 UTC,"Seconded. I'm a few months away from being able to vote, but I know a fair share of LGBT individuals that would greatly appreciate the opportunity to invade your bathroom. But seriously, go out and vote for us who can't. Stop treating LGBT as foreign things and recognize their humanity."

springfieldMO,31f0mz,turbulance4,4,Sat Apr 4 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"So, I tried to read through it and find what part prohibited bathroom use. This (bottom paragraph) was the closes I could find. Is this what all the fuss is about?"
springfieldMO,31f0mz,turbulance4,2,Sat Apr 4 23:02:04 2015 UTC,Thanks boss
springfieldMO,31f0mz,asyst0lic,6,Sat Apr 4 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"“In our code right now, 78-183, I can designate who goes into the bathroom and where people are allowed to go within my business,” Wichmer said. “I cannot have a prohibition based on race, creed, color, religious belief or national origin; notice we did not amend that for sexual orientation and gender identity.” --  Springfield City Attorney Dan Wichmer  So, basically, the whole bathroom issue isn't just speculative fear-mongering, according to the person who would be prosecuting violations of the statute, it's patently a non-issue."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,IOnlyEatMeat,3,Sun Apr 5 04:05:01 2015 UTC,"I love this argument.  If I as a man in a dress use the women's bathroom, I use a stall.  Meanwhile, we can have 20 guys with their junk hanging out standing shoulder to shoulder pissing into a trough.  I WELCOME the day that I use a urinal and a woman comes next to me and pisses like the scene from ""Step-Brothers"".  I'm voting NO."

I also attend MSU and the student body is overwhelmingly in support of voting no, including a public statement from the university president saying he will be voting no.  However, my one concern is that James River Assembly is openly against the ordinance and their pastor is urging his congregation to vote yes. That's nearly 10,000 people."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,IOnlyEatMeat,3,Sun Apr 5 02:44:32 2015 UTC,I have spoken with others who regularly attend church.  They all have told me that this topic did not make it in their preacher's Sunday sermon.  I have a problem with James River telling their congregation HOW to vote.  First they are swinging on Wal-Mart's nuts.  Now this.  I have no respect for ANY Assembly of God members.  There is big money to be made in religion.  http://www.jamesriver.org/sites/default/files/2013AnnualReport.pdf
springfieldMO,31f0mz,fryreportingforduty,7,Sun Apr 5 14:09:23 2015 UTC,"When I first move to Springfield and was looking for a church, I went to James River a couple times. This was about two years ago and I politely left after the pastor talked about how gays can be healed. It was heart breaking because the auditorium was PACKED and hanging on to every word he said.   Luckily, I've finally found a progressive, LGBT welcoming church."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,IOnlyEatMeat,2,Sun Apr 5 17:50:00 2015 UTC,"I don't have many LGBT friends, but I have heard of other churches that do not care.  One is First and Calvary on MSU campus.  I don't care what you're into.  If there is a God, let God sort it out.  Just try to be a nice person to fellow humans."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Crashes556,-28,Sun Apr 5 19:18:42 2015 UTC,IM voting YES! Downvote it up! This shouldn't even be an issue to begin with.
springfieldMO,31f0mz,TomCollinsEsq,16,Sat Apr 4 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"You're exactly right when you say this shouldn't even be an issue to begin with. People should treat other people as equals, because they're, you know, people. But the fact is, they don't. As a result, a populous dedicated to that ideal has no choice but to make sure there are consequences for abhorrent behavior such as this. And that's why we're here."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Xer0effekt,6,Sat Apr 4 17:41:19 2015 UTC,I'm just curious as to why? I really only want to have a civil discussion on the topic.
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Crashes556,-15,Sat Apr 4 16:57:09 2015 UTC,"I think if a trans wanted to use their bathroom and they look the part, go do it. This law opened up things beyond that, which was a non-issue to begin with. There shouldn't be any laws regulating this at all, in fact the government needs to stay out of something as simple as this and anything else really. We already have enough rules and regulations."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Xer0effekt,7,Sat Apr 4 17:11:52 2015 UTC,But the bathroom issue isn't even a part of the law.   http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2015/03/11/pokin-around-gender-identity-bathroom-debate/24747775/
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Crashes556,-9,Sat Apr 4 18:00:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly, so its a law to cover other non-laws that isn't a issue to begin with."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Xer0effekt,8,Sat Apr 4 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"But discrimination is/can be an issue. So if the bathroom thing isn't an issue, and churches are exempt, what's it going to hurt to have this law in place and official?"
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Crashes556,-10,Sat Apr 4 18:07:15 2015 UTC,It serves no purpose whether its a law or not. So why have a law? Should we start outlawing goose migration from the west now too?
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Xer0effekt,8,Sat Apr 4 19:19:56 2015 UTC,"Under your logic, then we should take away laws protecting race, religion, age, and gender in the work place."
springfieldMO,31f0mz,Crashes556,-12,Sat Apr 4 19:25:37 2015 UTC,Totally different subject.

That being said, people should be able to have their opinions count as much as anyone else's, without fear of being ridiculed.

springfieldMO,310e79,fryreportingforduty,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:09:57 2015 UTC,So you believe that all ideas have equal merit? I base my opinion on the fact that non discrimination has lead to less violence and ignorance against protected people in the past and that I have found no evidence to support the opposite opinion. Can you provide anything to show that that repealing the law would improve the community in any way?
springfieldMO,310e79,Automatic_Taglines,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"So you believe that all ideas have equal merit?   I'm not the judge of whether an idea is as good, worse or better than another. I can tell you how I feel about it, but its pretty hard to believe that everyone else will feel the same as me.  So who is right?  Is it the opinion who has the most backers?   I base my opinion on the fact that non discrimination has lead to less violence and ignorance against protected people in the past and that I have found no evidence to support the opposite opinion.   Non-discrimination most likely leads to less problems for everybody - if the people are willing. Legally forcing someone to serve or employ someone they don't wish to because of personal beliefs could have the opposite effect. Do you really think that their feelings/beliefs are just gone as soon as a law is passed? No, they are now being forced to do something they don't want to, creating animosity and passive aggressive behavior. There would also be a group to point at and blame.   Can you provide anything to show that that repealing the law would improve the community in any way?   Improve the community is a matter of opinion, once again.  Some would argue that business owners being allowed to run their businesses the way they see fit would be a good thing."

If you want to know which areas to avoid, we can point you away from those, too.  ISP's are either Mediacom or AT&T (or satellite if you're into pain and crying a lot), and I wouldn't get Mediacom if they were the last ISP on Earth. AT&T's speeds are dependent on your area (I used to work for AT&T wireless), but go from roughly ground level up to 54Mbps according to what package you want. For example, I live on the far west side of town, and I can only get 18Mbps max.  There's not much to do here, unless you drink heavily or like to shop at teenage girl stores at malls.

springfieldMO,30q97q,stone500,11,Sun Mar 29 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"The thing that really pisses me off about this area is the high and mighty attitude I see from a lot of churches and their congregations.  Jesus may not condone homosexuality but he would never condemn anyone. Period, end of story Jesus loves all people regardless of who they are and its people like this. He would never kick someone out of their home, nor fire them from their job. They say the preach in the name of Jesus and follow in his footsteps but in reality they only do so when it agrees with what they want to do.  Edit: (now that I'm at my PC) The line that says that SOGI discriminates upon Christians and their beliefs is about the most unchristian thing I have ever heard... Was it not Jesus who walked among the lepers while the members of the high church would not? The idea of saying one's sin is worse than another is crazy, in the eyes of God we all fall short. Get off your high and mighty throne and actually live like Jesus preached. I am going to leave you all with a bible verse (which should go SO well on reddit.)    Luke 18: 9-14 9 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: 10 “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ 13 “But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ 14 “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”"
springfieldMO,30q97q,tbare91,6,Sun Mar 29 21:31:17 2015 UTC,"What really grinds me about it is, like you said, Jesus would likely feed and provide for homosexuals, just as he would anybody.  Would homosexuals get into Heaven?  Eh I dunno, maybe, maybe not.  For the sake of argument, let's assume that homosexuals are denied entry to Heaven, as many Christians believe.  Based on this, many Christians would like to deny services to homosexuals as well.  So doesn't that mean that Christians are trying to run their businesses like it's Heaven, and they're St Peter?  That's fucked up."
springfieldMO,30q97q,MrProfDrDickweed,8,Mon Mar 30 01:12:00 2015 UTC,"Jesus never said a word about homosexuality when he walled the earth. The book of Leveticus is the only time it's mentioned, which is in the old testament. So these people preaching the word of the lord are reaching to the bottom of the barrel looking for just the slightest thing they can to back up their argument. I would love to talk to any of them that actually follow anything more out if Leveticus than that one verse. It fits the bill for their argument, even though they don't realize they undermine their entire argument by following only one damn thing and not all of it. Can't pick and choose that."
springfieldMO,30q97q,tbare91,7,Sun Mar 29 21:44:35 2015 UTC,"That is true, I forgot about that.... It's crazy how ""American Christianity"" has become so twisted into what is today."
springfieldMO,30q97q,asyst0lic,6,Sun Mar 29 21:47:55 2015 UTC,"It's just become a cover for bigotry. They don't follow a damn thing about it. ""Christians"" pushed me away from it with their shitty ways. Now I bear tattoos that embarrass me when people realize they are religious. I love the tattoos and what they mean to me, but I'll be damned if I dont feel apart of their shitty views. Its not ""religious freedom"" as the claim. Its bigotry and hatred with a self righteous title."
springfieldMO,30q97q,The_Fad,3,Sun Mar 29 22:10:27 2015 UTC,"No tattoos, but same sentiment.  Sometimes I have to explain a line on my CV that I purposely keep ambiguous (in case of offense) or if it somehow otherwise comes up that I was raised Catholic, I always feel like I have to tack on an apology, ""I mean, there really are some not-shit ones, I promise, but...eugh, yeah"".

If anyone says their food was amazing, they must have been drinking heavily through that hour wait time for their food.   Breakfast isn't hard. Mexican food is basically cumin and chilly powder.  I would think if the people who opened this place wanted it to be successful, they would have someone making sure the food was up to par with the prices.  My wife had the ""Blackbird"". Puff pastry has no flavor unless you add to it. It isn't a good base unless you do something with it. We both doused our food with hot sauce until it was all that we could taste.   I think the owners thought ""If we booze them, they will come"" but sadly describing this place as an excellent breakfast joint will fall flat for anyone with taste buds, even lubed with expensive alcoholic beverages.  Keep trying Springfield, someday, someplace, food worth paying for that you can't make at home will be around. The people that can give it to you will have to step up."

For a $31 breakfast bill (eggs atlantis, side of fruit, (2) sweet potato nuggs, a la carte chicken fried steak, and 2 Bloody Mary's) it should have been faster service. I was disappointed in the food as well. Had to add salt and pepper. Not sure if I'll ever go back as I wasn't wowed by the wait time either (30 minutes).  Overall I'd say 3/5 stars."

springfieldMO,30il4l,turbulance4,7,Fri Mar 27 23:52:42 2015 UTC,"A specially appointed task force did a 2 year study about whether or not they should make an ordinance protecting people from discrimination based on Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity, and they (and the city council) determined that it would be a valuable thing to have in Springfield.  A group of (as far as I can tell) religious people think being LGB or T is sinful and our city shouldn't encourage sin. They also say that it's bad for business because reasons. I actually have no idea why they're opposed because all I hear from them is that they don't want to bake Gay Wedding cakes.   Naturally, they want to repeal the already-passed ordinance, and would like you to vote ""Yes"". The LGBT community would like you to vote ""No"".  Those of you voting ""Yes"" to repeal the SOGI ordinance feel free to reflexively downvote and chime in. I'm genuinely curious what the well-reasoned explanation for repealing the SOGI ordinance is."
springfieldMO,30il4l,cnelsonsic,6,Sat Mar 28 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"they don't want to bake Gay Wedding cakes.   The way this part was explained to me:  A straight person walks into a cake shop and asks the baker to make a cake with vulgar language on it, and the baker declines. If a LGBT person walked into the same shop and asked for the same cake, the baker wouldn't be able to deny it because they're LGBT. How close that is to the actual law, I don't know."
springfieldMO,30il4l,IStoleHisSandwich,4,Sat Mar 28 01:03:47 2015 UTC,The thing is that they have to go to arbitration and an arbitrator decides if they discriminated based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. I don't know what kind of inquisition they're imagining.
springfieldMO,30il4l,cnelsonsic,2,Sat Mar 28 01:24:07 2015 UTC,"That is not accurate. It only prohibits discrimination based solely on the customer's sexual orientation or gender identity.

Where are the police and their leaders that were involved in that situation? They don’t speak up much today. You don’t hear them giving interviews on their role in that historic event. They seem to have slunk off into the shadows, and rightfully so. I’ve been thinking about this as I see the people in my town with the YES on Repeal signs in their yards. Aren’t they embarrassed?

springfieldMO,30il4l,garrettgivre,2,Tue Mar 31 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"I am an undecided on this question at the moment, but can share some thoughts.  First of all, there seems to be a lot of hate directed at anyone voting yes. This is not a simple issue and both opinions have valid points. A yes vote does not mean you are a stupid, ignorant, bigot as the comments on this posting indicate. Honestly I don't hear hate coming from the yes side. I do hear fear, but the hate is on the no side.  As for my thoughts, it is ALWAYS complicated and ugly to legislate morality. It is very easy to look at examples and say ""that is wrong"", but much harder to put it into law. In my experience, we end up with a lot of unintended consequences and little real change.   Let's look at examples Gay man in a dress walks into a wedding planner and asked them to plan his wedding. Owner of the business says ""I hate gays and I'm not doing your wedding"". I believe that most of the people in Springfield would agree that this is wrong.   In the real world, with this ordnance, what he would say is ""I'm sorry, our schedule is full"". The discrimination still occurs, so the law changes nothing.   An example of unintended consequence would be that the wedding planner does have strong feelings about that lifestyle and takes on the wedding because it is against the law to refuse. They obey the law, but the couple get less than the planner's best efforts due to the person's believes. I have to think that the couple would much rather have someone who accepts their lifestyle and would want the other planner to say ""you have every right to marry who you want, but due to my religious beliefs, I think you would be happier with someone else"". This illustrates the real question. Is this descrimination? Or is it caring for a fellow human being and wanting what is best for them? There is no way to know and no way to write a law to judge.   BTW, Jesus would have hung out with the gay guy in the dress, but he also started a small religious group that were all killed for standing up for what they believed."
springfieldMO,30il4l,benutne,3,Sun Mar 29 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"I'm going to write a rather long response to what you said because I don't think your formulation of the debate is entirely accurate. I hope you don't think I'm trying to tear you apart, because I'm totally not, I just think there's some problematic parts of your position.   This is not a simple issue and both opinions have valid points.   While I think sexuality and how to respond to alternative lifestyles is definitely not a simple issue, this is actually pretty clear cut if you take it in a historical context. There are multiple Supreme Court cases that set the precedent that you do not have the right to discriminate against protected classes in this country. Public opinion largely thinks that LGBT people ought to be a protected class. To hold the opposite view you are both going against dominant cultural norms AND history. In decades this conversation is going to look like conversations about race before the Civil Rights movement. It's pretty simple if you look at it this way.   As for my thoughts, it is ALWAYS complicated and ugly to legislate morality. It is very easy to look at examples and say ""that is wrong"", but much harder to put it into law. In my experience, we end up with a lot of unintended consequences and little real change.   Just because something is complicated doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. We can't force people to be tolerant but measures like this make the world better for disenfranchised classes. In a sense, to suggest we should repeal is to argue the hurt feelings of homophobes deserves equal weight with the suffering of LGBT people. Yeah civil right is always a messy thing, but it's the right thing to do even if the ways we go about it aren't perfect. We can always make laws better, but doing nothing isn't something we should consider.  The fact of the matter is businesses choose to exist. There is a long history of legislating morality on businesses in this country. Minimum wage goes against the personal beliefs of many employers but they still have to follow it. Many employers likely would love to skirt environmental regulations or safety standards but we force them to do it. The government has argued that we should legislate morality into business when there's  a compelling interest and discrimination against entire groups of people has been considered a compelling interest since the Supreme Court issued the Loving V. Virginia case that banned laws against interracial marriage. If you want to profit from owning a business, there are certain rules you gotta play by.  There is no reason why we shouldn't extend these protections to LGBT people. There is real world harm being done by the ability to discriminate.    In the real world, with this ordnance, what he would say is ""I'm sorry, our schedule is full"". The discrimination still occurs, so the law changes nothing.   You're ignoring the symbolic gesture this law has. This ordinance is literally telling LGBT that we think they ought to be accepted. An area's laws are generally considered to be a reflection of how their society feels about the world. Any law can be skirted so the fact that some businesses might get around it isn't a reason to vote to repeal. The existence of the law itself is telling LGBT people that they should feel welcome in this community. The act of voting no is our community reaffirming this belief. Stuff like that is important.  Also the fact that it's theoretically possible to get in trouble for discrimination will cut down on some of it. Laws aren't perfect but they do often have a deterrent effect. You're right that some businesses will make up lies but others won't want to risk their legal standing so they won't discriminate. Post-law, there will be less discrimination in the world than there was before it, so the law is worth it.   An example of unintended consequence would be that the wedding planner does have strong feelings about that lifestyle and takes on the wedding because it is against the law to refuse. They obey the law, but the couple get less than the planner's best efforts due to the person's believes   To purposely do a bad job risks the wedding planner's business. You can always fire them and get someone new and word of mouth travels. If the wedding planner wants to act like a petulant child, they're not gonna stay in business long because the gay couple might tell their friends ""don't hire them, they aren't very good.""  One key objection I have with this law is basically every single one of us has to do things at our job that we don't like. If I was a janitor, it's completely plausible that I could hold a distaste for cleaning gross public bathrooms as strong as any Christian objection to gay marriage. Why do should we privilege one type of distaste over another? It's not really fair. People should just do their jobs.   I have to think that the couple would much rather have someone who accepts their lifestyle and would want the other planner to say ""you have every right to marry who you want, but due to my religious beliefs, I think you would be happier with someone else"".   In a perfect world, this would work. unfortunately, there are entire areas of the country that this mindset has been proven empirically false. For example, many states have argued that pharmacists should have the right not to prescribe birth control  or doctors perform procedures that could help or cause an abortion out of religious objections. This means in certain parts of this country, it's impossible for a woman to actually get birth control or certain medical procedures because almost everyone is holding these objections while the few Drs and pharmacists that don't are too busy to keep up.  We could see similar situations about gay marriage. If most of the wedding planners decide to object on religious grounds, the few that are open to it will be too busy so people will be excluded. These exclusions simply put up barriers. A vote yes isn't protecting someone's religious beliefs as much as it's saying it's okay to make people's lives harder.   Is this descrimination? Or is it caring for a fellow human being and wanting what is best for them? There is no way to know and no way to write a law to judge.   Let's not play games about semantics about discrimination and ask a different question: should we have a system where everyone is afforded equal treatment under the law or should we allow people's personal opinions create a system where people aren't treated equally? I don't really care if a homophobic Christian thinks they aren't being discriminatory? it's the results of their advocacy that I care about."
springfieldMO,30il4l,bibiane,1 point,Mon Mar 30 07:51:35 2015 UTC,"I'm undecided on this and have some questions. I find it difficult to believe that an anti-discrimination law is necessary in our community, but I could be wrong. What are some examples of the discrimination and marginalization that gay people face in our community without an anti-discrimination law? I can't think of anyone I know that would treat a gay person any differently from anyone else or refuse them service just because they are gay, even among those people opposed to gay marriage. A lot of people like to make a comparison to the civil rights act but back then blacks were quite clearly systemically discriminated against by most businesses, e.g. restaurants, stores, etc refusing to allow blacks inside to the point where it significantly hurt the entire class of black people. If back then, they had alternative businesses to go to and any place that demanded 'whites only' was ridiculed and losing significant business, there'd have been no need for the civil rights act or of creating them as a protected class. But it was a real problem and therefore it was probably the right thing to do. But I find it difficult to see this same sort of problem among the gay community. There are gay bars in Springfield and pretty much everywhere I go people seem quite welcoming to gay people. So why do we need an anti-discrimination law?  I hope you can understand where I'm coming from, and I'm open to the possibility that I'm wrong and maybe there is a need for this. If I saw some examples of the discriminatory hardships that gays face without protected class legislation I may vote No. Would love to hear some input."
springfieldMO,30il4l,Crashes556,2,Tue Mar 31 03:39:08 2015 UTC,"Remember this law protects transgender people as well. I have a transgender friend who almost certainly did not get hired for her dream job because she is transgender. There were 20 candidates in the pool for the position, and she made it down to the last two. They were extremely responsive to her, but they totally shut down in her last interview when she told them she was transitioning from male to female. She felt she needed to tell them for fear they would do a background check and find out on her own. They ended up telling her that she was a little too ""creative"" for the job. There are many other stories like this one that I've learned while phone banking for the No Repeal campaign.  The gay bar example doesn't really get your anywhere logically. Before race was a protected class, there were black bars as well. I can also tell you that I've run into some terribly un-loving and intolerant religious folks on the phone that have even gone so far as to tell me they're ""sorry for me as a human being"" just because I was urging people to vote no."

Time to take a step back and examine how you are reflecting Jesus' character. You are allowed to disagree with their lifestyle, but you are not allowed to treat them as inferiors and discard their rights.

If you're looking for a way to get back at a church for citing its beliefs by taking away their coffee then I think you're going about it all wrong. They have a right to say what they want, and believe the way that they want. You're not going to solve anything by posting passive aggressive posts on Reddit. If they want to say that stuff, fine. Leave it up to them to be on the wrong side of history. I'm not overly religious, I don't go to church, nor do I like it when churches do this kind of thing to try to push their beliefs on people, and condemn you if you don't believe the same way. But they still have a right to an opinion, just like we all do.

You can choose to think of being gay as a sin just as you can also choose to not like the color of someone's skin. Are these two scenarios similar? I'd argue yes, since it is about extending human rights to all demographics. In both cases, in order to make progress, there had to be a side to tell the other viewpoint, ""No, you're wrong and what you believe is wrong.""  We shouldn't fault people for trying to make this a better place, although they may be misguided in their actions.

Seriously, can you not see why I'm a tiny bit upset?   I don't want you to like me, I don't want you to save me, I'd probably be happy if we just mostly just left each other alone.

I had an entire of folks whose entire job was managing and crunching numbers but I had them, a rail yard, about a dozen warehouses, a fleet of over 500 vehicles, 3 airfield (one a refueling field for airforce one) and in addition to the 775 people I managed we assisted close to 12,000 combat troops who, if we did not do our jobs and manage the money right, did not get the supplies they needed to conduct operations.

There are plenty of places around town that don't know how to do it.  I judge a place based on how good their cashew chicken is.  Sure, it's such a simple sauce and chicken combo, but some places still manage to mess it up, so I base my judgement on the idea of ""If they screwed up this simple dish, the other dishes probably aren't that great.""  And in most cases, I also find that the rest of their dishes are pretty good after trying them, assuming I've stuck around long enough because of their cashew.  My favorite place for cashew?

Lots of them have less than 30k miles and can be 25% to 50% less than new.

I'd assume these vests are vital protective gear so why did the department only have one vest?   edit: Checked out the website for this company. Each vest is only 950 dollars and protects the dogs against bullets and stab wounds. I don't know, maybe I'm overreacting but its disheartening to think that SPFD has a K9 unit but doesn't have the funds to provide proper gear that could save a dogs life. They invest thousands of dollars in the training of the dogs and handlers but something simple like a protective vest is overlooked? Makes me wonder what the ratio is for the officers? Do 6 officers share one vest?"
springfieldMO,2zf39l,blu3dice,5,Wed Mar 18 02:14:46 2015 UTC,"I believe the vest were about $800 each and the vests being donated are brand new units.  I would assume vests are vital gear as well but apparently among many police departments, unlike working with military K-9s which is what I am used to, it is common practice to rotate a small number of vests among numerous K-9 officers.  I was actually a bit shocked to find out we only had 1 K-9 vest especially considering we just spent over a million dollars of one time money on new patrol cars and equipment. I have to assume the chief or somebody knew this was coming since it was not on the equipment list for purchase but then again, we only had 1 vest for 6 officers."

springfieldMO,2z6j25,Wrinklestiltskin,5,Mon Mar 16 00:39:39 2015 UTC,"Haha, why is that not surprising? How exactly did the accident happen?  Edit: Wait a second... After looking at your name you have become my prime suspect OP. If that is your real name..."
springfieldMO,2z6j25,bthornsy,5,Mon Mar 16 01:48:35 2015 UTC,Haha...yes!
springfieldMO,2z6j25,Kgrimes2,6,Mon Mar 16 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"There was a crazy wreck on 65 today just north of sunshine. Looked like a one car accident... Car was destroyed and of course flipped. Springfield drivers, yo."
springfieldMO,2z6j25,katdur,3,Mon Mar 16 02:55:53 2015 UTC,Saw that on my way to Branson. Absolutely insane. Do we know what happened exactly?
springfieldMO,2z6j25,Kgrimes2,3,Mon Mar 16 06:52:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what happened but it was a one car accident, a family from Ozark I believe. The father and two children survived but the mother passed."
springfieldMO,2z6j25,bthornsy,2,Mon Mar 16 14:57:26 2015 UTC,That's so sad.
springfieldMO,2z6j25,asyst0lic,3,Mon Mar 16 15:23:59 2015 UTC,Saw that as well. Fucking awful.
springfieldMO,2z6j25,Zombie_Response_Team,6,Mon Mar 16 23:13:09 2015 UTC,"How do you even flip a car (edit: absent massive collision)?  I know that's a problem with tall or top-heavy vehicles like Jeeps or some SUVs, but sedans?"
springfieldMO,2z6j25,mcveyla,7,Mon Mar 16 03:29:00 2015 UTC,In a parking lot of all things?
springfieldMO,2z6j25,Spastic_pinkie,7,Mon Mar 16 05:06:01 2015 UTC,What the hell is wrong with drivers in this town?
springfieldMO,2z6j25,wheep,7,Mon Mar 16 01:20:52 2015 UTC,My guess is that there must be some kind of gravitational anomaly occurring in the Ozark region.
springfieldMO,2z6j25,mcveyla,6,Mon Mar 16 03:28:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Springfield drivers aren't that bad.  If you think this is bad you should visit a larger city sometime."
springfieldMO,2z6j25,saucercrab,3,Mon Mar 16 04:50:38 2015 UTC,I lived in Tampa for the last 5 years and just recently returned. During that time I drove all over the state and only found driving to be as bad as it is here in Miami.
springfieldMO,2z6j25,Spastic_pinkie,3,Mon Mar 16 11:10:42 2015 UTC,"I usually don't believe in the whole ""people from X drive like Y"" phenomenon, but did encounter a noticeable difference in driving style while in Miami. They crazy."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,mcjoness,5,Sun Mar 15 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting a while for someone to do this! I'd still need a permit for when I'm carrying in other states, but I think it's moving our state in the right direction. Look up ""constitutional carry"" or ""Vermont carry"" for more info."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,pacmanfan,2,Sun Mar 15 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion! I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to current carry laws, but this seemed different than the current regulations and I didn't see it reported anywhere on local news sites, so I thought I would share."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,pacmanfan,2,Sun Mar 15 17:04:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's different, for sure! Not the clearest title; it probably only makes sense to people familiar with the current laws about CCW. Some other states have some form of ""constitutional carry"" already, or have bills for it in the works."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Crashes556,5,Sun Mar 15 18:16:59 2015 UTC,Come to /r/ccw
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Zykax,2,Mon Mar 16 01:26:06 2015 UTC,I'm already subbed over there.  Getting my class done in a couple weeks.
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,techhorder,2,Mon Mar 16 22:44:07 2015 UTC,From the article... 'The bill would eliminate the requirement for individuals to get a permit in order to conceal a gun.'   The title is misleading
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,techhorder,4,Sun Mar 15 15:06:54 2015 UTC,"I pulled my title from that of the article.  edit: Title of KOMU article, ""Missouri Republican wants to eliminate concealed carry law."""
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,thedevilsmusic,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:48:51 2015 UTC,"I noticed that, sorry, should have said the title of the article."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Jew_T_Warden,2,Sun Mar 15 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"What an awful idea.  Every person carrying should have some formal training, even if it is only the current CCW garbage."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,MissouriReds,6,Sun Mar 15 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"the formal training should be at the purchasing level, not for carrying."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,phokas,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:40:59 2015 UTC,Rep. Eric Burlinson has a huge gun. http://imgur.com/ABlYb5C
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Mowah,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:04:35 2015 UTC,So....if this passes we're required to have a license to drive a car but not carry a gun? I don't understand republicans.
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,cobraman115,2,Mon Mar 16 03:45:31 2015 UTC,Honestly the fact that you can open carry is also stupid.
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Jew_T_Warden,3,Mon Mar 16 04:48:28 2015 UTC,"It's not stupid that you have the right to, but strategically it is.  It paints you as the first target in a defensive situation.  Although if you see anyone ever open carrying, they will be the last people on Earth to be a criminal.  Criminals will always conceal because they don't want the attention."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Mowah,4,Mon Mar 16 05:34:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's dumb that the law encourages people who are not trained to handle fire arms to carry them about. I totally don't have a problem with guns but I think it should be like driving a car in that you need to pass a basic competency test in order to be able to leave your house with one.  It's not that I think everyone with a gun is a criminal, it's that I can't assume everyone who has one knows what they're doing with it."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Jew_T_Warden,-2,Mon Mar 16 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"I'm totally buying a gun and I'm gonna roam outside his house at night, perfectly legal."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Mowah,2,Mon Mar 16 20:39:37 2015 UTC,Not sure why the downvotes on you or the article.    The bill would eliminate the requirement for individuals to get a permit in order to conceal a gun.   Is this not different than the current laws?
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Jew_T_Warden,2,Sun Mar 15 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"Yes . Currently to conceal a gun on your person you must have a permit. You can legally carry a weapon openly, like on your hip or across your back."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Mowah,4,Sun Mar 15 15:55:03 2015 UTC,"Buying a gun with that intent to use that gun in an intimidating and stupid way, is much different then owning a gun and carrying it on your person. this is a very ignorant statement."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Mowah,-2,Sun Mar 15 17:06:47 2015 UTC,"The very fact that every cunt around the corner can have a gun, is very scary."
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,autowikibot,3,Mon Mar 16 02:39:22 2015 UTC,Whether that statement is true or not doesn't have anything to do with the fact that you threatened to buy a gun and stalk someone with it.
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Mowah,-3,Mon Mar 16 04:11:04 2015 UTC,It seems like my only legal option.
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Mowah,4,Mon Mar 16 04:21:37 2015 UTC,You sound like an idiot so I'm gonna just leave this one alone.
springfieldMO,2z4iwj,Mowah,-4,Mon Mar 16 06:10:27 2015 UTC,"No man, I'm totally doing it, I'm gonna quit my job and school and go hang out outside his house till I starve.  Fucking idiot still stuck on that joke."
