strife,3dx0tl,_Frozenx_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:10:10 2015 UTC,I think jungling is only really worth it if you can take them out quickly in between phases. It's seems to always be more of an option than something you want to dedicate yourself too. I tend to go for the big yellow camps if I have nothing better to do and I'm in the area with someone else who can speed up the process.
strife,3dx0tl,DreamProfit,2,Mon Jul 20 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"Well, you really have to see a team jungle and own while doing it in order to say its worth it. I've seen teams do this...with multiple heroes: gokong, zaku, hale....something     If u look at a replay of a team that jungles...you will notice that getting the ancient camps (there are two on the map....one on each side by mid lane with 3 enemies) gives you a sizeable gpm boost especially during lane phase. The GPm boost is even larger if there happens to be a treasure chest ancient (the middle guy). The key though is maintaining control over the lane while doing this. If you lose out on too many minions or lose your foothold in the lane by doing this....it could backfire. You can learn this best by watching replays of other players doing it....just look at the GPM charts when you are in ""spectator"" mode as they do it to see the gpm boosts.  In terms of jungle camps, I always grab them when I can't find the enemy or am waiting for a potential some1 to fall into a trap. If I'm going from one lane to another somewhat urgently I will stop only for treasure chests. These are somewhat important I believe. They can randomly spawn in any of the jungle camps. It gives you a nice little gold increase....its not huge or anything...but its worth taking the time to get them. I mean if you are in a 2v2 top lane and the camp to the right spawns a treasure chest....you really should try to get it. It's not worth dying over or anything, but its worth the time out of lane to do it (as long as u don't completely lose control of the lane). IT IS KIND OF CONFUSING! The lanes are more important ultimately, but jungling can be used to make you MORE powerful if you manage both these things.   So if allied creeps have pushed under enemy tower, in what situation I should farm ancient camps or attack enemy tower?     You do it when you can't damage the enemy tower to any significant degree, can't damage the enemy to any significant degree, and can't last hit minions that easily. It also helps you get the enemy away from the tower so you can kill them easier when you get back. Its usually a case of trading tower damage for raw gold/exp...which is usually a good trade. On the other hand in some situations its better to just stay in lane and keep the enemy bottled under their tower the whole time. It really depends on who you have on ur team and who you are fighting. I mean if you have a vermillion and flakk mid lane...you usuallly might as well stay by the enemy tower and keep the enemy bottled if you can.  I mean another example is: if I die bot lane to the enemy, when I respawn I head back to lane but take out a jungle camp along the way there. By the time I get back I'm the same level as the enemy who just killed me. Usually there's a 1 level difference when u die in lane phase..but get that creep camp and you really don't have to worry about being behind on exp."

strife,3dx0tl,davidka939,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:55:45 2015 UTC,"I know about three ways to take jungle camps in a gold efficient way.  The first one is to take the jungle camp(s) near your lane whenever you managed to push your enemy under his tower. You need to be very fast in doing this because if you lose lane gold+XP it is not really worth it.  The second is to have one hero in your team that can hold midlane 1v2. Because you won't always have the right hero and a skilled enough player on it in your team, this only works reliable if you are premade with someone that can 1v2. The tactic I saw most is to start the midlane 2v2 and the jungler leaves the lane to go jungling, whenever he is strong enough. In this case you want to have one of the jungle pets, Luster and Fiki as the jungler.  The last way is to take jungle camps in the mid/late game when you can't farm because most lanes are pushed out."
strife,3dx0tl,D20p,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"It's your decision if you want to attack the tower or take a camp. In the early game I usually go for the camp because my damage on the tower is very low. When I see the chance to do a lot of damage to a tower or even kill it I will go it.  But it's generally a choice of playstyle. If you go for a lot of camps you just want to get to lategame sooner, if you go for the tower all the time you want to win your lane pretty fast and try to snowball from the tower gold and from roaming to other lanes when your lane is won."

strife,3dx0tl,InfectedWithDrew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:24 2015 UTC,"This might be true, but for some reason I only see solo mid.  I think the reason for this is that you can use the fact that mid is ganked so easy to let the jungler gank the 1v2 mid lane. The 1v2 lane will usually need ganks, because even the best defending hero can have problems against 2 people if they know what to do. Meanwhile the 1v2 hero is pretty safe, he has to play carefully or is pushed to his tower because of the player deficite anyways."

People do not realize that it's actually way harder to hit 3k playing always as 3 stack than soloQing since you need something close to 90-95% winrate to hit 3k as 3stack and 70% is more than enough solo.  And as I said in the post from the screenshot, if you don't reward player for being good at the game in any way, there's no incentive to get better or to play competitively, which is bad as dev stated they dont want the game to be casual. Being in a situation where good players hit 3k and then nothing is not really acceptable.  And before you misinterpret it, I got nothing against snax or the fact you guys premade, just dont call out people you don't even know on this when you guys are the most notorious stackers of the game lol.  Edit : Might as well reply to the thread, I don't get to play with players from NA or SEA so as far as I'm concerned it would be relit EU. He is just one step ahead of the other good players of this region. Like if you had to put eu players in tiers, he'd be on his own imo. Way better than the average 3k elo scrub Kappa."

strife,3d6cca,Siegvater,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:09:35 2015 UTC,"No worse off than it always was. Before the addition to Steam, these numbers were roughly the same. There was an expected spike during the first weeks of [Steam] release, but it came back down to normal. Strife's situation has not changed much at all for at least half a year. At the very least, we have a relatively small, dedicated number of players coming back but not many new ones are arriving through the Steam client. That's what I take from it.  ie. Someone could have easily said the same thing months ago. There is always going to be someone who thinks numbers below one thousand indicates a sudden death. Strife is not suddenly dying, it's just not suddenly growing like we want it too. I don't see how there has been any meaningful change in Strife's population recently, I am grateful for the community we have which shows a meager portion of stability - the main problems we face now concern S2's future. If those could be resolved, maybe these numbers could start increasing again."
strife,3d6cca,DreamProfit,2,Tue Jul 14 08:15:59 2015 UTC,"Steamcharts shows a clear downwards trending curve - it's not ""how it's always been"", player numbers are constantly shrinking. You can just take the short spike at the end of May out and it almost ressembles a line.  Strife isn't suddenly dying, noone makes that claim. Strife has been constantly dying for a long time now and S2 is all to blame for it. I am sorry for all former S2 employees that have been fired and have to watch seeing all their working hours put to shame."

It could help since we get a few posts from time to time where people ask why can't they and all their friends play together in the same party. Yes.

Before I knew it, I was homeless living in the vehicle I had purchased with my money, the ""Bang Bus"" Eventually I found a job, I'm making minimum wage working at S2 studios, being the executive custodian. I now live in the basement, because they gave me a good deal. It's a 1 bedroom gig, with a microwave and a minifridge. I've been endulging myself with hot pockets and ramen for the last 5 months. Masterbaiting frequently, and leaving used tissues around the room. In the afternoon, I daydream about my past Strife career. And what could have been, had the game progressed.

strife,3cwpev,InfectedWithDrew,2,Sun Jul 12 07:59:29 2015 UTC,"The more I think about this the more it doesn't add up. That screen is updated daily at 12am EST as far as I know, but it seems that it hasn't updated since it hit 0 days remaining. The season ended at 8am EST so you had a total of 32 hours to go from 17004 to 18120. So you needed to gain 1116 LP in 32 hours. It would take a minimum of 56 games, if you won all of them, to get enough LP for that.  Assuming you played non-stop for 32 hours, won every game, and had an average game length of 34 minutes or less and absolutely no queue wait time and instant load times, I can see how this would be possible. But you do have to wait in queue, you do have to wait for people to load, and you can't consistently close games in less than 30 minutes.  You also didn't win every game (your PvP rating only went from 2751 to 2777, and 1116/20 is not a round number so you obviously had to lose some games.) Also, your final score would have to end in 4 or 9 since you were gaining LP in multiples of 5 but yours ends with a 0. Unless you played exactly 1 gold match and won it, your end result is pretty unlikely. Your PvP rating is high enough that you getting into a gold match is pretty unlikely anyway.  You claim 15 minute SEA matches, how often did that happen? If the game ended within 15 minutes you must have been playing against very bad opponents, is the entire region garbage? You couldn't have been throwing those games because that would require 7 minute games and you wouldn't have gained PvP rating.  If my assumptions about the amount of time you had to work with are wrong, and you had a lot more time, then okay, what you did was definitely doable and congrats! But if my math is right... we just got punk'd. :)"

strife,3cybnb,TheOneAndOnlyOddish,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:52:20 2015 UTC,"In fact, it may make things worse because people just lose track of how many times someone has died and start to accuse others of feeding very harder, when they haven't fed that hard, or it is in fact the whole team that is being outplayed instead of a particular person.     Trolls who commit acts of toxicity based on legitimate information and data? Where can I find these people? I must breed an army of them and use them to wipe out the strife trolls.    I agree with the other posters here, it doesn't provide me that much useful information. Oh and I use the old ui still, and it still has kills+assists...whenever I use the new ui I'm always looking to take kills from my allies to make sure I'm never too far behind or 0...which can happen in some cases. So I willl agree that they should go back to a kills+assists system for counting.     If you wanna further this discussion and convince people, you should focus entirely on what seeing everyone's kills will do for you and the game.    However, I do like to keep an eye on how both teams are progressing and the lack of a death counter column is kind of annoying.    I mean this is really all there is to your post imo. We alrdy kno about the other stuff and we see very little point seeing kills to begin with. So you basically gotta first convince us why its good to have kill counters, but in terms of strategy and gameplay...not trolling and pr stuff. That one line on it being a nice feature and not having it is annoying...isn't enough to convince me or really anyone here."
strife,3cybnb,Kite_43,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:20:36 2015 UTC,I agree. Am I missing something though? The new UI shows kills/assists.
strife,3cybnb,DreamProfit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:40:21 2015 UTC,By Kill+assists I meant the Old ui only shows one number per player. The new ui shows two numbers: you get the number of kills and the number of assists separately...the old just pools them together as one number. So if u get 10 kills and 5 assists you only see the number 15 in the old ui.

strife,3cvumd,Aphradil,2,Sat Jul 11 05:09:32 2015 UTC,"Hey there everyone! I'm rather new to Strife myself (started playing a few days ago) and I've been enjoying the character Ace! I particularly enjoy his ultimate! I was wondering if anyone had any build suggestions as I've been building him mostly magic damage with slight tank features, but I don't feel like in using him to the fullest potential. Does anyone have a build suggestion to discuss?"
strife,3cvumd,Warnek,3,Sat Jul 11 08:20:35 2015 UTC,"Hey Aphradill,  I suggest you go on StrifeBuilds which is the best site for builds and guides :)  Edit: https://strifebuilds.net/builds/ace"
strife,3cvumd,GoodFightSon,2,Sat Jul 11 09:04:47 2015 UTC,"Strifebuilds is a great site! I also wanted to mention that it's important to be versatile with items in Strife - if you're crushing early on you have much more freedom to go for more damage and to consolidate your lead (and keep one hitting those rooks ;) ) but there are also situations whereby you'll have to tank up and sacrifice some damage in order to do so to ensure you don't die in fights!  So just remember, that it's important to read each game differently =)"
strife,3cvumd,Warnek,2,Sat Jul 11 09:14:54 2015 UTC,I totally agree and thanks for the compliment on the site :)  On strifebuilds.net most of the guides have a long description and gameplay tips so you will know how to play a certain build regardless of how the game is going
strife,3cvumd,Aphradil,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:16:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick response guys! I'll take a look at the sight for sure, and I'm sure it'll help! Thanks for the tip on being versatile as far as builds go! I know in some games it's like a linear item path that a character should take so it's nice to know that it's not exactly set in stone as far as builds go!"

strife,3cvumd,SlammerHammer,2,Sat Jul 11 09:29:47 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone.    I'm gonna be straight up here, been playing league for 5 years but I've been pretty frustrated with the direction they're taking the game now. A few questions for you guys:  What's the jungling situation like? I know strife has a pretty unique way of earning gold and xp. Is it viable or not?   What's the community like?  Is our viewed as a dying game or one that could break through?   Are there any groups to play with/teach newer players?"
strife,3cvumd,Aphradil,2,Sat Jul 11 10:47:29 2015 UTC,"What's the jungling situation like? Is it viable or not?   Strife's meta is 2-2-1 because the ""Dragon"" is between top and middle. There is no dedicated jungle role because the jungle creeps are difficult to clear level 1 and you get more gold due to shared gold. However, once heroes hit levels 2-4, it's no uncommon to see 1 person leave the lane to farm a few camps. Heroes like Gokong, Hale, and Harrower can benefit from farming the jungle while their lane partner holds tower 1v2. Heroes with great wave clear like Chester, Ray, or Malady do well with this strategy.   What's the community like?   There are two sponsored tournaments. ESC and Strife Weekly.   Is our viewed as a dying game or one that could break through?   I touched on this a bit earlier, here is a link to my response.   Are there any groups to play with/teach newer players?   SNAX is a Strife community that holds training nights, in-houses, and has a whole bunch of people constantly playing Strife. Personally, my favorite Strife Twitch streamer at the moment is Relit_ because he is a lot like MuchIsGosu, no talk, just music and gameplay. :P"
strife,3cvumd,Kite_43,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:19:23 2015 UTC,Hey there! I also played league for 4 years myself and a little smite over the past year and I was looking for something fresh! I have been enjoying this game very much! Personally I don't think the game is dead but I don't think people really know about it? I didn't hear about it until I was browsing steam and it came up in the recommended games for me to play! So no the community isn't dying if anything it just needs a little push in the right direction so if you have to  any friends you should bring them along with you to make our community a little bit bigger!
strife,3cvumd,bigboom789,0,Sat Jul 11 15:16:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for the record, Strife is investing $0 in marketing at the moment. Most of the S2 resources are currently working on the China release."
strife,3cvumd,TheFlyingFucktard,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"People say there is no jungling just cause in tournaments to date it hasn't been used effectively, for good reason though. Jungling is still very viable for normal matchmaking. Infact if done correctly you can guarantee a significant level and gold advantage which will almost always translate into a win. Most people don't know how to deal with jungling, but it goes both ways. If you want to jungle you are gonna need to do a premade with one other person who can hold a lane 1v2 while u jungle. I only know one good jungle route, I'm not sure which route poky and others who pub stomp using a jungler use. Something you can look into on your own if you want to jungle."

strife,3cvumd,InfectedWithDrew,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:08:05 2015 UTC,So what's the deal with potions?  How do you buy a health potion?  Does it just restore a flat amount of health?  I've seen people with potions before but I have no idea how to get them.
strife,3cvumd,-Agent_of_Chaos-,3,Sun Jul 12 02:48:24 2015 UTC,"Heals 350 Health over 10 seconds. Taking damage dispels the effect. Restores 150 Mana over 10 seconds. Taking damage dispels the effect.   You can just search ""elixir"" or look for ""Consumables"" tab.  Potions are extremely useful. Many players will start the game with at least one potion and more than likely always have 1 or 2 on them at all times throughout the game, since 350 health is quite a lot."
strife,3cvumd,InfectedWithDrew,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:59:18 2015 UTC,"What do you guys think of the item ""numbing lantern""? I have been playing since closed beta and have never seen it used on my team or the enemy's. I saw some guy on strife builds say he uses it on bandito and that's the first I've seen that item brought up. What heroes would this item be best on in ur opinions?  And is it worthy of taking an item slot when another item can be/is better"
strife,3cvumd,-Agent_of_Chaos-,2,Sun Jul 12 13:34:43 2015 UTC,"It's very good on a few heroes (it's particularly good on Gokong.) 25% power reduction is pretty huge, it means basically 25% damage reduction. People are sleeping on Numbing Lantern."
strife,3cvumd,InfectedWithDrew,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:14:32 2015 UTC,Interesting do you find yourself using it often?  And with what other heroes do you use it on
strife,3cvumd,InfectedWithDrew,2,Sun Jul 12 18:12:43 2015 UTC,"I tried it with Bandit.0 and it was nice but dependent on refunds. I hypothesize that it could be good with Iah if her elementals count and Lady Tinder if Petals counts. It would be good on heroes like Rook and Moxie who can apply the three stacks quickly, but only in a solo lane IMO. It's also very good for ADCs in a solo lane, especially if they're facing Rook or Moxie. :)"
strife,3cvumd,-Agent_of_Chaos-,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"Good to know,  ty for your input drew"
strife,3cvumd,General_Tsuki,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"I don't like the item.  Reducing one's power is normally best used on an assassin, but who is going to get 3 hits off on a Malady before she stuns and ULTs someone?  A carry won't pick it up because it provides health. Other items are much more effective, such as Gaurdian Helm that reduces all incoming damage by nearly 25% itself, plus is heals magic damage dealt.  I can see a support picking it up, but the trade off is very bad when you compare it to other items. Spirit Ward can shield your entire team. Windrush can disengage and pick people off. Seer's Eye is great for scouting. Cursed Wand can help shred tanks. Eye of Tempra and Hexbane are great at peeling.  I guess heroes like Vex, Bandito, or Eanu picking it up. People that could find a way to apply all 3 stacks easily. They need AOE damage that is easy to hit."
strife,3cvumd,InfectedWithDrew,2,Sun Jul 12 14:19:30 2015 UTC,"Guardian Helm alone makes your Resistance go from 10 to 50, so your damage reduction goes from 9.1% to 33.3%. That's 24.2% difference (but it has diminishing returns as you get more Resistance.) Plus it only works for you, not for your whole team, and it costs nearly twice as much.  You're right to say that it's hard to get 3 hits off on a burst hero, but this is only for most heroes. It's easy to do with Gokong. The featured Gokong build on strifebuilds is insanely good because it rushes a Numbing Lantern."
strife,3cvumd,Kite_43,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"On-hit effects from GoKong's ultimate are reduced by 60%, this includes Numbing Lantern."
