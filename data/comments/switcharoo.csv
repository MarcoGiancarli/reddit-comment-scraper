But as the switcheroo gets more popular, people are linking on things that aren't actual switcheroos. Once that link goes up, it's part of the chain, and removing it at that point is difficult. Originally, the switcheroo had to do with pictures of people, then it expanded to ""option A and option B, I'm going to reply as if you meant B when you clearly indicated A, lol switcheroo!""  Now, it's not even that bare minimum anymore..."
switcharoo,39n7hu,CedarWolf,4,Sat Jun 13 01:37:50 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand me. Originally, the switcheroo was about pictures of redditors posing with famous people, usually with the title along the lines of ""look who I met today!""  Then, in the comments, someone would reply ""I didn't know <famous person> was a redditor! But who's that with you?""  And that was a switcheroo. They were a little more rare, and easier for one person to keep track of the chain.  But now, anything getting switched is grounds for a switcheroo, and people are doing it just to get a switcheroo, and that's fine, but it also means that this sub gets many more submissions a day, and quality has clearly fallen as a result.  To wit, as the switcheroo gets more popular, we're getting more links that aren't actually switcheroos, and there's no real way to reject those bad links without risking a break in the chain."

Blanchard divided trans women into two different groups: homosexual transsexuals, whom Blanchard says seek sex reassignment surgery to romantically and sexually attract (ideally heterosexual) men, and ""autogynephilic transsexuals"" who purportedly are sexually aroused at the idea of having a normative female body. The typology suggests distinctions between MtF transsexuals, but does not speculate on the causes of transsexualism. The distinction is a recurring theme in scholarly literature on transsexualism.
