If people want a ""happier"" version, the Sergeant who was losing his mind must have gotten the ""Green Weenie."" everyone knows the Marines love to hand those out.  Maybe his fiance took his house, cheated on him, spread lies that he was the cheater, and repo'd his car (happened to a guy I deployed with).  Or maybe even he just loves the Corps and was upset because he was going to be involuntarily separated because he didn't get selected for Staff Sergeant in time.  I don't know.  Every actual, credible story I saw about this video reported that he was diagnosed with PTSD.  Its unfortunate he lost control in the manner he did, but it happens.  I didn't even see combat when I deployed and I still jump sometimes if there is a sudden, loud bang.

Why are they not treated with the same recourse as soldiers, or what about rape victims... surely thats a trematic event... enough to cause PTSD one would think right.  So if that lets say man who was raped in prison now has PTSD while still in prison,  if he kills another inmate due to his disorder then why do they add jail time.   So Who is accountable then? thats all I want to know.  Life sucks shit and bad shit happens to most people a lot and its inevitable so why bother considering PSTD all together?"

PeopleBeingJerks,3dml3l,BigREDgrin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:19:57 2015 UTC,"Gang members are conditioned by their surroundings. So yes, location, upbringing, peer pressure, poverty, lack of education, racism, etc. all contribute to the situation--and I would also add PTSD to many gang members depending on what sort of conflicts they've been involved in and which family member or close friend was gunned down in front of them, or how many times they've been shot, depending on their mental strength.  Yes, rape and molestation causes PTSD, depression, anxiety. Women aren't loaded with testosterone though, so it presents differently in women. There is no single blanket response to how somebody with PTSD reacts to triggers.   As for who is accountable--the guy is accountable for his own actions. I don't get what is so hard for people to understand. HE is the one who flipped it. HE is accountable for his actions. It is HIS fault that he is acting like a gorilla--BUT--the reason he is acting like this is most likely related to PTSD. Having PTSD is not an excuse to act this way, but is most likely the reason. I really don't get why people can't differentiate between an action occurring and WHY an action occurred."

Don't be so quick to judge. Yeah, he looks like an asshole in this few minutes of his life, but who knows what he's gone through that made him flip like that?   I'm not saying what he did is right, not at all, but unless you have PTSD yourself, I don't think you can properly judge this guy, either."

PeopleBeingJerks,3dml3l,tinyp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:58:45 2015 UTC,I'm not defending his actions. I already said that. I'm trying to raise awareness and make people think about the fact that things aren't always what they seem.
PeopleBeingJerks,3dml3l,Ruth_Gordon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:04:31 2015 UTC,"Well you kind of are... Even aside from the dubious politics of the 'war' he was fighting, isn't it self inflicted? I'm sure he was perfectly aware of the risks involved when signing up.  If a drank a bucket of LSD and permanently damaged my brain who is to blame? Me or the LSD? It's pretty clearly me."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dml3l,tinyp,2,Sat Jul 18 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's true at all. You're really judging him because of what sounds like your own personal anti-war, anti-military bias. He looks young. He was probably idealistic, or part of a military family. Nobody plans on getting shot. If you drink a bucket of LSD you're 100% guaranteed to trip balls and screw up your head. If you join the military, you never know where you're going to wind up. Case in point--my father joined the army during the Vietnam war. He was stationed in Korea the entire time.   Also, as already stated and now quoted verbatim: ""I'm not saying what he did is right, not at all..."""
PeopleBeingJerks,3dml3l,Ruth_Gordon,0,Sat Jul 18 01:58:57 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear I'm not anti-war, I just think many countries have lost their way as to what wars they should be fighting. Nor am I anti-military I just hate the doublespeak of 'dying for your country' and 'fighting for freedom' etc.  As to your other point while it is clear that you don't know if you will have to fight, or where you may end up you are fully aware of the possibility of having to kill or be killed and everything that goes a long with that.  Obviously the man needs help and it should be provided (as I think it has in this case) but the fact you bring up the fact the guy was in the military and has a purple heart reads as an excuse for his actions (no matter how much you say you don't excuse it)."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dml3l,tinyp,5,Sat Jul 18 02:15:03 2015 UTC,"Again--that's your own interpretation of what I'm saying, and it's incorrect. As already stated, I think what he did was wrong. Giving a reason why something happened doesn't excuse it.    I brought up the fact that he's military and has a purple heart (which is what's given out in the US to designate that somebody has been wounded in battle) as the most likely cause of his erratic behavior, as in PTSD.   Let me lay this out for you:  Normal people don't act like this.   Why is this guy acting like this? Is he abnormal?   Why yes, he is abnormal--he's been shot in war (military, purple heart).   What could being shot in war do to someone?   It could cause PTSD.   Is this normal behavior for somebody with PTSD?   Yes, it is, if a trigger situation occurs, somebody with PTSD could completely flip their wig, just like this.   Is this an excuse?   No, it's is probably causation.   The End."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dml3l,Ruth_Gordon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:24:01 2015 UTC,Do you actually know this guy has been diagnosed with PTSD? There are plenty pumped up douchbags out there that react in this way without going near a war zone.  Also don't you agree there is a fundamental culture in the military that trains people to act in this way? Which is all cool on the battlefield but not so great when you get home and realise you have been trained into being an over agressive bonehead.
PeopleBeingJerks,3dml3l,tinyp,2,Sat Jul 18 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know--but having known other people who have PTSD, he sure acts a lot like them during their blowouts. I haven't said he had it. I've said it's probably the cause.   But seriously--nobody acts like that for no reason. Even an overly-aggressive bonehead acts that way because they have been conditioned in some way to respond like that. There isn't a single person on Earth who acts that way with zero issues to factor in. Again--NOT AN EXCUSE, behaviors don't happen without a reason."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dml3l,Ruth_Gordon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:04:36 2015 UTC,"Deleted response to my comment:  ""yeah but... so what? does he somehow have less of a responsibility to act like an adult in public? he's out of control, and he's not self-aware enough to catch himself, and in that enraged state he's dangerous... I don't think it matters what his 'excuse' is. Knowing that he's got trauma is relevant for how to get him the help he needs... but otherwise, I don't see what bearing it has on the way he's acting. :\""  My response to deleter:  He doesn't have less responsibility to act like an adult in public, but he does have less ability to act like an adult in public. With the right trigger (like, whatever happened that made him start brake-checking which led to him being rear-ended which would be another trigger) he's not in his head anymore. PTSD is serious."

This group of people was apparently trying to stay together on the slide and stopped multiple times on the way down, which is incredibly stupid and dangerous.   The guy was pissed for having to stop multiple times (and putting himself in a vulnerable position while stopped) so I believe his intention was to get really close to her but not actually hit her. I think he just wanted to scare her. However, if you notice in the video, she stops suddenly once again right before he gets to her. At this point he's going fast and has absolutely no time to react so he slams into her.   So before everyone pulls out their pitchforks please consider the fact that these people were complete idiots and put everyone in danger by stopping throughout the entire damn slide.   By the way, I'm not saying the guy wasn't being a jerk. He was obviously being a jerk, that's apparent from the video. However, he had justified reasons to act the way he did given the situation.

One of the comments says that before the ride, the father and the guy in the video were arguing and the guy purposely went slow as to piss him off. The guy even stopped and waited for them to finish a couple times. I don't think this is his fault."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,Aspect_Legacy,2,Thu Jul 16 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"What does that have to do with the girl he hit?  If the person in front of her slams on their brakes, she has no choice but to brake too.  He did it intentionally, knocked her out while screaming 'fucking bitch' at her.  I don't know how you can say that's not his fault.  Also, it should not be possible for people to ram each other at that speed.  It seems like a design flaw in the ride itself.  Maybe they should run it like a waterslide, where one person has to clear the end before the next person goes."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,ferret_fan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"I really don't think he did do it intentionally. He did his best to stop multiple times and stay back, but they were too slow. Fair enough, I don't think the girl is at fault. But then I think the father is."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,Aspect_Legacy,2,Thu Jul 16 22:40:56 2015 UTC,"He says 'I'm going to fucking ram her!  Fucking BITCH!' and then screams in rage right before hitting her.  How on Earth do you think that is not intentional?  The father may have been being an asshole, or he may have been scared, but that still doesn't make what this guy did OK.  He should have complained at the bottom, not taken it out on the girl in the middle."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,ferret_fan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:12:11 2015 UTC,"Because you aren't supposed to stop for any reason. They stopped. They were going about the same speed, and then the father stopped, and then she had to stop. It was a silly situation that could've been avoided if a) the guy went first instead or b) if the father wasn't stupid and kept going fast the whole way. I believe this is the ""fast lane"" too, I can say without certainty though."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,Aspect_Legacy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:08 2015 UTC,"The word intentional means 'on purpose'.  You said he didn't mean to do it, but he says that he's going to, and then screams and does it.  That is intentional.  Weather or not the guy in front slighted him, it does not make it ok for him to injure the person in the middle.  He had the ability to stop, and he didn't.  Quite the opposite."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,ferret_fan,0,Fri Jul 17 12:40:23 2015 UTC,"screaming 'fucking bitch' at her.   That's like screaming at a car in front of you, while your in a car behind them.  It just doesn't work.  You can't hear them."

PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,ChapWOP,10,Thu Jul 16 02:11:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm not sure but, the last time I thought I did I wasn't screaming ""fucking bitch"" and sounding like I've been shot"
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,ChapWOP,9,Thu Jul 16 05:53:50 2015 UTC,"I don't get why the girl didn't tell the guy who met her at the bottom.  She had to have been hurt.  That guy who hit her should've been thrown out at the very least, but if they got their hands on that video he should've been charged."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,barnacledoor,5,Thu Jul 16 12:12:50 2015 UTC,You're apparently not suppose to stop on these things (according to a comment in the video) he wouldn't get charged at all for this tho there's no reason. She and the people in front of her constantly stop or slow down hard so he'll catch up and going that speed the momentum will definitely carry thru the breaking
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,that_random_asian,5,Thu Jul 16 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"Not really her fault she was slowing down when you can consistently see that she's got other people in front of her. Looks like she was trying to keep a safe distance between her and the people in front of her, just like the guy should have been doing (even if it was frustratingly slow).  Not to mention, in the entire video, the only person who ever comes to a complete standstill is the dick that rammed into her."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,Fire_Bucket,0,Thu Jul 16 04:54:03 2015 UTC,"That is true there were other people in front of her, I'd say if I were to blame anyone it would be those people in front of her. I still don't think the guy should take all blame here tho bc he stops couple times in the video to give more space between them and she brakes suddenly, however he couldve had more space between them which would've gave him more time to react. Kinda comes down to the rules of the hill which no one knows which is why everyone is blaming anyone"
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,that_random_asian,2,Thu Jul 16 08:39:33 2015 UTC,He deliberately kicked a child in the back with enough force to knock her out...
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,aqaspecification,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:43:39 2015 UTC,"i didn't see her stop, though she did slow down when people were in front of her.  he had plenty of time to stop.  i just wish the person the girl was with found out so he could beat this guy unconscious."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,barnacledoor,6,Thu Jul 16 10:28:42 2015 UTC,"She looked really young to me, and she was crying when she got there... maybe she was crying that much she couldn't talk/was in shock? Who knows."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,Hoborrrr,0,Thu Jul 16 15:34:22 2015 UTC,"yeah, that makes sense.  still wish she told so the guy could've been dealt with."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,barnacledoor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:29:38 2015 UTC,"Oh I was praying she would. I was going to say hopefully he felt bad, but the fact he posted it to the internet makes me think not."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,Hoborrrr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:34:51 2015 UTC,"And the fact that he didn't say anything either.  Shit, that little girl could be seriously hurt.  He could just say it was an accident because she slowed down or stopped and wanted to make sure she was ok.  Instead, the piece of shit disappears."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,barnacledoor,2,Thu Jul 16 16:03:19 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't for the chance of breaking the girls neck, she deserved it. If those carts had nice head rests that nicely protected the head and neck, I'd say ram her twice as hard.  Well, maybe not the girl but whoever kept slowing it down."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,Zerocyde,4,Thu Jul 16 17:35:31 2015 UTC,"Not saying what this guy did was right in any way, but I've been on a few alpine slides and it would make me furious when someone was going slow in the fast lane, and It's very possible that that is what she was doing. The few alpine slides I've rode have had a fast and a slow lane, and nothing would piss me off more than having to wait in the ""fast lane"" line, which is usually around twice as long as the line for the slow lane, for about half an hour, only to have my ride ruined by someone going slow in the fast lane, making me have to spend the ride I was looking forward to speeding down, going the slow speed that person is going."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,redlawnmower,2,Thu Jul 16 19:23:20 2015 UTC,I think the hit was a surprise to him. He was obviously trying to get clise and be an ass but I don't think he meant to hit her.  Still an asshole for not realizing what would probably happen.
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,Stolypin26,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:46:09 2015 UTC,"watch the video with audio starting around 4:40, he's screaming and saying ""fucking bitch"" for a good 15 seconds before he hits her.  Afterwards he's huffing and puffing like it hurt him too, and saying ""shit, she doesn't look so good"" as she's slumped over."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,CannibalVegan,3,Thu Jul 16 11:41:33 2015 UTC,"I curse and scream at people in traffic, doesn't mean if I actually hit somebody that I did it on purpose."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,Jacariah,8,Thu Jul 16 13:14:36 2015 UTC,Slamming her hard enough for whiplash to completely knock her out doesn't seem like it potentially could have broken her back? It's an alpine slide.
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,CombatWombat222,3,Thu Jul 16 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"Even the first time I watched this, it looks like it could have been an accident. It looks like she runs into the person in front of her first, and he might not have had time to react. That's just what I saw."
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfewr,BlazerMan420,7,Sat Jul 18 04:16:26 2015 UTC,Apparently you didn't watch the whole thing and if you did you're blind as fuck. He knocked her out! He has some serious issues.

PeopleBeingJerks,3dfzz0,sharkbait999,2,Fri Jul 17 20:28:51 2015 UTC,is anything he says true? like will he win in a court of law?
PeopleBeingJerks,3dfzz0,immakilayou,2,Thu Jul 16 08:28:21 2015 UTC,"No. He keeps saying he didn't agree to anything, and wasn't shown any 'court documents' by the ticket inspectors. He doesn't have to be literally shown a document, it's displayed on the train, which likely refers to an agreement that you enter with the operator when entering the train. He agreed to a legally binding contract, which the cop points out at the end.  Freedom of travel just means you can travel freely within the country - it doesn't govern how you can travel. Just because he's being thrown off the metro isn't impeding his right to travel freely, because he can walk without being impeded. To be honest this extract of the constitution is a bit redundant. Like much of the constitution, it's referring to when you'd have to literally get a horse to where you want to go, and you wouldn't be stopped from doing that. It's quite outdated.   Using this logic to try to get out of paying a transit fare is like citing the same extract from the constitution whilst hopping into the back seat of a random car and demanding they take you somewhere.   This type of video is similar to those 'I know my rights' videos of guys carrying weapons in public and complaining when cops stop them - except technically those with firearms are not contravening any laws, and this guy is."

All of his son's baseball games he missed. All of the times he should have called his mother to tell her he loved her before she passed. Every decision that he knew would take him down the path of anger and self loathing that has led him here to this exact moment. Lying in the gutter, being pinned down by a stranger. Being recorded on a video that will soon air all over the local news. Helplessly waiting for the police. Waiting to reap what he has been sowing for so long."

PeopleBeingJerks,3dad13,Logic_85,3,Tue Jul 14 19:08:05 2015 UTC,But a distinction can be made between self defense (which this was) and an 'ass whooping.' Any additional violence beyond subduing the man would have been criminal.

And it might vary from state to state but here in CA lane splitting isn't illegal?"
PeopleBeingJerks,3dad13,TheBeardedMarxist,2,Wed Jul 15 10:34:30 2015 UTC,all of you are wrong...there is no law that expressly prohibits lanesplitting. its the same way that breathing is not prohibited or allowed by law. a university study showed that lane splitting is actually safer. a good majority of motorcyclist injuries are because of being rear ended. if you're lane splitting the speed difference is very little if done safely (the study said not more than 15 over the current flow of traffic) as a motorcyclist i feel much safer spliting than I do otherwise

PeopleBeingJerks,3dad13,ballison,2,Tue Jul 14 19:06:23 2015 UTC,I didn't have the link handy but I can find it later. I'm on mobile. I rely on actual expert advice. I can send you links for days that support this as well as point to the fact that most countries allow lane splitting and their injury or death rates are not different from the United States. Find a scientific study that shows that splitting is dangerous and I will legitimately pay attention to it. Otherwise I will go with the data that I am seeing as well  as my experience as a motorcyclist.

There was absolutely nothing alarming about that fall, and if the dad had have made a big deal of it then so would the kids since it would seem to them like a big deal. Dad did the right thing just letting them get themselves up; if they were hurt then they would let him know.  Then the dad kicks the ball and it hits one of them, resulting in a nastier looking fall. The ball looks pretty soft, and the fall surely wasn't nearly as bad as just the shock factor of it, but then the dad comes running to check on the kid.

It is entirely unnecessary for civilians to own semi-auto rifles built on a modified assault rifle platform. lunatics, people with ANY criminal record, people who fail to pass a safety course, or people don't have a justifiable reason to own a handgun or a rifle should not be permitted to buy a gun or ammunition.  the second amendment is ludicrously archaic, life isn't a movie, owning a gun doesn't make you anymore of a man, if you want to play with guns, go join an airsoft team or play call of duty, don't go carrying an ar-15 as you walk down the street in your jeans and t-shirt to buy a bigmac and act like a child when the police call you on it."

PeopleBeingJerks,3cxl1m,Creature_73L,8,Sun Jul 12 03:10:20 2015 UTC,"Couldn't disagree more as a liberal who supports reasonable gun control.  Open Carry is honest, transparent, and has potential to deter crime.  We can piss and moan all we want about how fewer guns equal fewer gun deaths, but we live in America where firearms are common and owned both legally and illegally.    A weapon carried in the open deters opportunistic crime.  Think about it, if a criminal walks into a 7/11 intending to rob it, if he sees a customer or clerk who is open-carrying a handgun, does that person rob the 7/11 or does he move on?  Call me dumb, but I believe he moves on.  I would also argue that logic dictates that someone who is willing to open-carry is law-abiding because of the amount of scrutiny placed upon that person.  The young men in this video with their sovereign citizen bullshit are idiots, but they are idiots who have chosen to let the public know that they are armed.  As a pragmatic person who does not believe that intelligent men/women buy into sovereign citizen dogma, I appreciate that they are willing to put on display their political beliefs so I can keep my distance."
PeopleBeingJerks,3cxl1m,trinu40,4,Sun Jul 12 03:27:38 2015 UTC,"I support gun rights but I agree. Open carry should be illegal, particularly with rifles. I don't understand why any citizen would never need an assault rifle over a pistol in a situation. I guess if a criminal has one too, but then why are you playing vigilante and possibly sparking a gunfight? Keep a rifle in your house if you really need one. Put it in a case when you take it to hunt, you don't need to open carry.   I also agree about your limits on gun purchases, except the last one. I personally don't have any reason to own one, but I would like to buy a handgun. Although I absolutely plan on taking classes on safety, I don't have a criminal record of anytime, and I am not mentally ill. Add a several month waiting period on that gun purchase and I don't see a big problem with gun ownership.   Edit: whenever I say rifle in this comment I mean semiautomatic or automatic. Not bolt or pump action."
PeopleBeingJerks,3cxl1m,xDrSchnugglesx,5,Sun Jul 12 03:36:33 2015 UTC,"The most legitimate use of a gun is for hunting, and very few hunt with a pistol. Pistols are also much harder to see. If a private citizen is open carrying, I'd much rather he or she be carrying an obviously visible rifle.  I grew up pretty far north, and it was commonplace to see people walking around with rifles - especially before, during, and after deer season.  I think we're all too tied up in knots with unnecessary fear when it comes to rifles. I've never held a handgun in my life, but I've carried and fired a half-dozen rifles."
PeopleBeingJerks,3cxl1m,thrawaTheSecirst,-4,Sat Jul 11 23:54:46 2015 UTC,"I should have clarified. When I'm talking about rifles above, I meant semiautomatic and automatic rifles. I have no problem with bolt/pump/whatever other action rifles used for hunting. My issue comes in when you can fire 20-30 shots in 10 seconds and reload in another 10-15. Personally I would own a hunting rifle if I lived somewhere I could hunt."
PeopleBeingJerks,3cxl1m,xDrSchnugglesx,5,Sun Jul 12 02:46:10 2015 UTC,"Hunting rifles are commonly semiautomatic. As soon as you take your first shot, those deer are bolting. In my experience, bolt or pump action guns are less common than semiautomatic.  That's why there was the Clinton-era initiative against magazine or clip sizes. That's something I can agree with. But banning semiautomatic rifles entirely I can't get behind, especially with the theoretical possibility that we should have to rise up against our government."
PeopleBeingJerks,3cxl1m,thrawaTheSecirst,2,Sun Jul 12 02:54:52 2015 UTC,The entire purpose of people doing this though is so that it becomes commonplace.

If he owned the spots, they'd be numbered and he'd be given some sort of card as proof of ownership (or assignment) so he can have violators towed.  Public parking spaces (such as in public lots and street parking) are often first-come-first-serve, but many like to ""save"" their spot by putting something in it, like a parking chair.  Aside from several Northeastern US cities where parking chairs are considered a necessary public humiliation, saving public parking spaces without permit is illegal.  You're just making life harder on everyone else.  Also, I believe that if someone in Russia really wanted to park there, they'd have no problem.  There seems to be plenty of room between the car and the curb to park if you somehow ""manage"" to get in."

It's gone up in price over the years since I bought a model similar to that one. But it paid for itself in three uses.   The tenants all know that the lot is private and only paid residents can park there. My number is engraved on it, but if I'm at work you wait until I'm off. Cash in my hand gets it off as the sign clearly states ""unauthorized cars subject to tow and fines"".    No one believed the sign until I started booting assholes in my spot and charging.

PeopleBeingJerks,3aww42,resilienceisfutile,18,Wed Jun 24 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"So here is a story about old people who drive.  Got some time?  Old people have ran into my front bumper at the grocery store too many times for me to count.  One lady ran into the front of my minivan while I was putting groceries away in the back.  I run out to the front, my plastic bumper is all caved in, she's parked into me, and she's just getting out and I said, ""Hey lady, you ran into my van!""  ""No I certainly did not!""  So I tell her to take a look and thank God there was another woman there who saw it because granny goes all ballistic on me saying I ran into her and turning the crash on me.  Well, she's still going off her nut, I call the cops because she is now DEFCON 1,2, and 3 and getting her finger into my face (plus it didn't help that I was giving her a few choice words, but at least it kept her from leaving).  Cop is around the corner comes in like 3 minutes flat, she hears the stories, grandma is now mouthing off to the cop that she is a war veteran, has a spotless driving record, has been a citizen of the country for all her life, and that's when she drops the bomb and says, ""... unlike that Chinaman there!""  Female cop just stops her cold, pulls out her notebook, and says, ""Ma'am, your tags are expired.  License and proof of insurance please.""  The lady who witnessed all this mess from the start, she was awestruck and whispering, ""Ohmygosh, ohmygosh.""  One more cop on the scene, one very expired driver's license, and one very expired insurance later.  If the cop didn't mention it I wouldn't have noticed, so I took a look at her tags and they were out by 2 years and a many months.  I knew I wouldn't (and didn't) get jack squat because of her no insurance, so I left it.  Told the cop I ain't pressing charges or looking for cash because she probably is going to need it more than me, BUT please for all that is good, to make sure that nutjob of a lady doesn't get her keys back when they tow her car away.  Luck would have it that Dodge had a recall about 4 months later on the airbag crash sensors and they replaced the crushed one (didn't even know it was crushed) for free.  Bumper is still broke, but plastic is plastic.  Getting rid of the minivan in a few weeks."

He is turning the money over to her and has to wait who knows how long for her to pack it all up and take it to the bank and hope that she doesn't ""lose"" any of them in transit.  Now, from the woman's perspective, she was given a ton of pennies.  She's not going to sit there and count it in front of him.  So there is no proof he gave her what he said he did.  So she won't sign anything until she can verify it.  What does she do if the guy miscounted?  She refuses to sign until he fixes the error.  Do you ever wonder why you have to count your money right at the teller or cashier in many places?  Once you walk away and the money is out of their sight, they have no proof that you haven't done anything.  They could give you a $20 bill and you walk away and swap it with a $10.

PeopleBeingJerks,39hyeq,modernbenoni,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:55:55 2015 UTC,Well there were two judgements and he won one of them if what he says is true...
PeopleBeingJerks,39hyeq,ThisFrickinSite,2,Sat Jun 13 00:59:40 2015 UTC,I think in Canada and the US there are laws that prevent people from just change dumping someone like this.
PeopleBeingJerks,39hyeq,athanathios,6,Fri Jun 12 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"Then you think wrong (as far as the US goes). It is legal tender for all debts. You can refuse a sale to someone who is doing this, but you can't refuse repayment of a debt in all pennies.  Not too long ago there was a vid of someone who was mad about their car being towed and the police forced the tow company to take payment in the form of all pennies since that was a debt."
PeopleBeingJerks,39hyeq,Nabeshin82,2,Fri Jun 12 16:47:54 2015 UTC,"In Canada it's right, due to the pragmatism of the law, I assumed it as in the states, thanks for clarifying, in Canada I think you can only pay maybe 50-100 pennies at most, that was before we took them out of circulation."
PeopleBeingJerks,39hyeq,athanathios,2,Fri Jun 12 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we really need to do the same in the states. Pennies are not cost effective for anything. Having our money be divisible to 1/20ths is good enough, 1/100ths doesn't make sense due to the change in the real value of our currency over the last hundred or so years."

PeopleBeingJerks,39hyeq,athanathios,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:59:27 2015 UTC,In Canada anything more than 25 cents in pennies can be refused.
PeopleBeingJerks,39hyeq,Voice_of_Sley,-1,Fri Jun 12 18:00:37 2015 UTC,"It's more that there's no legal obligation to take ANY form of currency as payment. This happens all the time when assholes like this guy act like children and try to pay various things they don't think are ""fair"" (like parking tickets, property taxes, small claims court judgements, etc) in pennies.  It often ends with either payment being refused, not considered valid, the expense of processing being deducted from the payment, or the person being held in contempt of the court."
PeopleBeingJerks,39hyeq,suagrfix,2,Fri Jun 12 16:40:28 2015 UTC,that's wrong. For debts they have to accept the payment.
PeopleBeingJerks,39hyeq,Uridiawt,2,Wed Jul 1 22:50:06 2015 UTC,"A real pro would have kept the pennies in rolls and handed them 3 loose pennies saying, ""They're from 3 of the rolls.... figure out which."""

I've had people in the private sector tell me not to take photos or be somewhere that's on private land. What I try to do in these situations is talk with the person, let them know I'm a good person and just trying to get news out to people. If they object, I typically leave it alone, but recently I covered a train derailment. One guy said the owner didn't want pictures taken or people on railroad property. So I walked up to the public road and took photos from there. Sometimes you gotta ignore what people say and take the photos (within the law). It can get hairy, but I've never had any big issues."

We're there because someone is having the worst day of their lives, and right in the middle of it we have people getting in our way, asking questions, taking photos, slowing us down while we're trying to do our job, etc. That itself is bad enough, but if someone has been seriously injured or has died? That's just bad taste, one of the firefighters in my department was injured at a scene, a small cut on his face that bled alot, and before he could be discretely escorted to the ambulance to have it patched up, atleast five journalists were all over him, preventing him from being seen to, and then they had the gall to run stories such as ""Firefighter seriously injured fighting fire!""  ."

I have a drone and there's an irrational fear of them because they seem like something from a science fiction dystopia. I've received quite a few disapproving comments. Never mind that a drone is utterly impractical as a device to spy on your neighbors. 15 minutes of battery life, LEDs that can be seen from thousands of feet away, and motors that are legitimately louder than an idling vehicle. A camera propped up with a selfie stick is way more invasive, or a ladder with some binoculars.   But for some reason, people feel justified in destroying someone else's drone.

When the press shows up they are asked to stay behind a line for their and the fire crews safety."

The fireman that sprayed the drone was on the second floor, and the others were just milling around. So it isn't as if the drone put anyone in any undue danger. Not to mention, I have a feeling the chances of a quality drone crashing, are about the same as a helicopter, and news helicopters film from above fires all the time. A helicopter falling into a fire is far more dangerous than a 15lbs drone."
PeopleBeingJerks,396msb,robbyb20,3,Tue Jun 9 21:07:27 2015 UTC,"One thing to remember is that when a drone loses communication with the controler, it doesnt always ""fall"".  Sometimes it shoots in one direction, or maybe the operator was on the opposite side of the fire and when it lost communication it started to go ""home"" and that took it thru the house.  THose blades when spinning arent a joke.  Could you image one of those flying towards you at 50mph and when do you stand there?  What if you jump out of the way only to find that you landed on a weaked structure and fall thru?  Or bump into somethign that causes more wreckage and endangerment.  I have no problems with quads as toys, ive looked extensively into getting one and have narrowed out a lot of the DJI quality stuff and going to 3d robotics.

There are plenty of drones that hover when they lose connection, and if the battery starts to die, they just land wherever they're at. Which wouldn't have been on the firefighters heads.   Sure I wouldn't want to be hit with a quad, but I'm also not generally (ever) wearing firefighting gear. If I was go ahead and crash it into me, I doubt I'll care.   I say the operator was more than responsible with their use of the drone. The fire was out, and they wanted a closer look.

The EXTREMELY inebriated neighbor could barely talk when the cops came. Did you know damaging a drone valued over $500 is a FELONY?? This guy found out the hard way when he refused to pay for the damage! The BEST part was when the cops asked him about the big GASH on his leg and he admitted the drone hit him when he swatted it!

PeopleBeingJerks,38ew77,catherinecc,12,Wed Jun 3 21:01:15 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ, it's not the police that is bringing down the criminal element. It took the army to control the gangs, but why were their gangs their in the first place? Maybe because police constantly took bribes, gangs were able to buy machine guns, drugs were easily transported through those areas, and schools and infrastructure were very limited. I might be tempted to start taking things into my own hands if my council stopped collecting garbage, stopped providing public transport etc.   In situations were cops start acting brutal for the sake of being able to, that only escalates, look at the rioters in South Africa before apartheid was abolished, crowds would hack white people with machete's. Riots in the UK against the Irish, couldn't stop the brutality so they they just started random bombings. Look at the LA riots, look at the riots in Ferguson. Police escalate the brutality it becomes an open invitation to do the some by rioters."
PeopleBeingJerks,38ew77,ersu99,9,Thu Jun 4 10:42:53 2015 UTC,"Are they being jerks? The guy is obviously still combative and they're trying to subdue him. Maybe I'm just naive, but I believe the majority of police are good people. There's always a few bad apples in any group. It's always easy to look at an after action report and say ""you should've done this differently"" or ""the action you took was excessive"" but these guys lives are on the line every day and they have to make snap decisions in the heat of the moment. It's a tough job and we should support them for what they do."
PeopleBeingJerks,38ew77,Tuffgongg,18,Thu Jun 4 11:01:46 2015 UTC,"I do agree, most police are good people. But the guy is clearly restrained by several other men, the spray was overkill, hence the cop was being a jerk just because he could be."
PeopleBeingJerks,38ew77,benweiser22,5,Thu Jun 4 21:12:42 2015 UTC,"No; they're trying to get him to give in so they don't have to physically restrain him. The longer you use physical force to subdue someone, the higher the chance of you or them getting injured or worse. The spray is not overkill; it's a logical reaction to his failure to comply."
PeopleBeingJerks,38ew77,BigGreasyGil,2,Thu Jun 4 04:24:48 2015 UTC,I think the proximity of the spray might have also been used so close to minimize how much would splash onto the other officers.

PeopleBeingJerks,37852v,bresnasty,24,Mon May 25 18:14:05 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of 2 federal statutes/laws:   The UCC, specifically: § 3-603. TENDER OF PAYMENT.   (b) If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused, there is discharge, to the extent of the amount of the tender, of the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse with respect to the obligation to which the tender relates.   and US Code, specifically: 31 U.S. Code § 5103 - Legal tender   United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.   Edit: please note this is for debts. The treasury clearly states:   There is, however, no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy."
PeopleBeingJerks,37852v,JD-73,9,Mon May 25 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise.   Doesn't this pretty much ruin the whole ""pay however you want"" thing provided there is no state guidance? Unless I'm missing something, that means that the tow company does not have to accept payment in pennies since the towing company is a private business?"
PeopleBeingJerks,37852v,AmateurHero,20,Mon May 25 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"No, it's the difference between owing a debt and paying for goods/services.  It's clear that going to a store and trying to pay for groceries with pennies they can refuse you. On the other end paying your taxes is clearly paying a debt, so no ambiguities there.   In this particular case, if he had his own car towed it would be paying for a service. However someone had him towed without his permission, so he now owes a debt to the tow company (and they are holding his car hostage until he pays it)."
PeopleBeingJerks,37852v,JD-73,3,Mon May 25 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"someone had him towed without his permission, so he now owes a debt to the tow company   Can we just take a second to comprehend the ridiculousness of this statement? I understand companies wanting their lots for their own customers, but it still feels like kidnapping/ransom."
PeopleBeingJerks,37852v,zweischeisse,2,Tue May 26 11:37:11 2015 UTC,"What is your proposed alternative? The law seems to focus on the other end of the equation out of necessity. There is private property (land) owned by a private entity (company). Someone (person) has left their own private property (car) on the land against the wishes of the company.  At this point, the right of the person to not have their car towed is superseded by the right of the company to determine who belongs on their land.  Otherwise, it would be completely reasonable to start parking your car perpendicular to the flow of your neighbor's driveway without asking and not needing to move it. Also, this private lot means that the company is being paid in some form to deliver a service (in the form of a parking lot).  So we know that the company has to remove the offending property and should have the right to do so. However, tow trucks don't work for free. So now you have another group (tow trucks) that are performing the service of removing the offending car. Upon doing so, they also need to ensure that the car doesn't get damaged (although some do a shitty job of it). So they now have to provide both a service and their own land that is a protected lot until the person is ready / able to reclaim it. This costs them money as well.  TLDR: It's not so much ransom as it is ""stop being an asshole and many bad things will stop happening to you."""
PeopleBeingJerks,37852v,Nabeshin82,5,Tue May 26 13:49:04 2015 UTC,I never said it was a bad system or even one that needed to be changed. I just said it felt criminal (to the one whose car was towed).  Especially when the parking lot is empty and the business isn't even open.
PeopleBeingJerks,37852v,zweischeisse,3,Tue May 26 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"If they have apple trees and don't even pick the apples, is it OK for you to pick them?  After all, the company that owns the lot are paying for all of the upkeep and maintenance. Also, it prevents cars from being parked overnight and left the next day when the lot is in use. Not having cars in the parking lot significantly reduces the capacity for other people to break the law in their parking lot by doing things such as breaking into cars, doing drugs, or fighting. They won't have to clean up broken glass and trash from people loitering in the lot.  At the end of the day, it's their choice what to do with their resources. Just because it makes the asshole that doesn't follow rules feel bad doesn't mean it's bad. There are cases where cars are towed illegally, and those should absolutely be investigated / treated appropriately.  If you had a bedroom that you weren't using in your house, would you be cool with random people just climbing through the window to sleep in it? Should people be able to squat in a vacation home when no one is staying there because they're vacant?  At the point that your car is impounded, it's being held as collateral against a debt you incurred by them removing your car."

This is a college town and all they do is target the students. I had my car towed out of my assigned spot even though I had a valid permit.

PeopleBeingJerks,37852v,mel11ism,18,Mon May 25 18:23:00 2015 UTC,You should have reported your car as stolen. Towing companies can get in a major legal hassle if they can't adequately provide a reason for taking a car.

In the couple minutes it took to walk to the slot and back, a tow truck driver had noticed and was pulling into the parking lot to tow her as she got into her car, he thought she was parked illegally because the library was closed. That would have been at least a little understandable but then he attempted to block her into the parking and get her to get out of her car so he could tow it. That went way over the line."

I still think a ticket would be a sufficient deterrent. It costs hundreds of dollars, plus the cost of transportation, (which for me would be 40-50 dollars min), plus potentially losing a day of work to recover your car when its been towed. It seems kind of harsh in a lowish-income area."
PeopleBeingJerks,37852v,ASunCame,2,Tue May 26 08:16:31 2015 UTC,"I had my car towed once, and had to have someone wire me the money so I could get it out of the tow company's lot. So I went to a Food Lion to pick it up. They were really short on cash and gave me 300 smackers in all ones and fives.

In other words, people actually pay extra money to decrease their vehicles' fuel efficiency, and increase its output of pollutants. It completely blows my mind that people who are this ignorant are capable of earning enough money to even own these vehicles to begin with. Additionally, if you look closely, you'll notice that the truck driver actually slowed down for the sole purpose of blanketing these pedestrians with smoke. These people actually consider pedestrians and drivers of hybrid vehicles to be the assholes, simply for choosing to walk or drive more environmentally friendly vehicles.

PeopleBeingJerks,36twhg,Enormowang,2,Fri May 22 14:12:56 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Earth Day is stupid.  e: Okay, since you don't get it: On Earth Day we are encouraged to turn our lights off for an hour. But we only turn off unnecessary lights, because they're, hey, unnecessary. And we mainly only do it for an hour. Corporations get to participate in it by turning off their skyscraper lights on one fucking day a year, then claim they are being ""green"" and ""raising awareness"" which doesn't actually do anything to help anything, and in fact, by advertising their weak measures as substantial, gains them unwarranted business by people who want to feel good for ""helping the environment"", when in fact they're buying from a company that has changed no business practices at all, except they turn the lights off in their most prominent building for an hour a year. That's eight thousand, seven-hundred and sixty-five hours the lights are on. If they supply plastic bottles of water at their annual corporate fun-run while raising awareness for breast cancer, they just wiped out any carbon emission savings for that year by several orders of magnitude.  ""Raising awareness"" for a cause typically does nothing to help that cause, while giving all participants and supporters a reward for doing something good.  If we really want to curb greenhouse emissions, it won't happen by you and me using 10% less power in our homes, it'll happen by the power being used to create all the stuff we buy being generated more efficiently. That means the power station has to improve its emissions or switch to another energy source like natural gas, which still produces CO2, but is the best of the conventional fossil fuels in this regard. Right now a very large fraction of produced natural gas is ""flared"" at the well. Meaning they just burn it as it comes up. In Iraq, about 60% of produced natural gas is disposed of in this way, as there's no infrastructure to capture, pipe, store, or generate power from it. Levels are a bit lower in the shrinking list of middle-eastern countries that aren't war-zones, but still woeful.   So, in conclusion: Fuck your impotent, masturbatory Earth Day, you hair-shirt ""environmentalist"" who thinks you can absolve your guilt by turning off the lights for an hour.  I know the intentions are good, but it achieves nothing and may actively stifle real change by distorting the real issue."

PeopleBeingJerks,36twhg,itsadeadthrowaway,3,Fri May 22 11:47:59 2015 UTC,"It's really not as simple as just increasing fuel pressure, but we'd have to get into a very long and technical discussion about the various engine management systems to settle this. For starters, the injectors have a very strict period of opening (SOI, Start of Injection) and closing (EOI, or End of Injection). A change in pressure will cause the computer to compensate by changing these timings, but then there's also atomization, nozzle pattern, and various other factors that the computer is constantly (read: many, many times every second) monitoring and adjusting for. I think this is where I'll stop cluttering up this group for now, though, since we're really not going anywhere but in circles."
PeopleBeingJerks,36twhg,itsadeadthrowaway,-1,Fri May 22 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"No, there is no atomization sensor and no nozzle pattern sensor, of course; I was referring in those instances to the same thing you mentioned, that the computer is always measuring the quality of combustion, which will be affected by atomization and nozzle pattern, and a combination of all the things we've thus far discussed. You apparently chose to ignore my statement about not wishing to get into a long technical discussion so that you could make your ""Aha, I got you"" moment. I know you understood that I was simplifying and paraphrasing in lieu of getting into that long and drawn out technical discussion, so congratulations on finally exposing your butthurt by misrepresenting what I said in your zealous attempt to one up me.

PeopleBeingJerks,36twhg,cspyny,2,Fri May 22 14:11:57 2015 UTC,"kind of like the Pick 2 of 3 option for cars (fast, cheap, reliable), you have to sacrifice one area to get the others in most cases.    For performance, there's a similar compromise that has to be made (low noise, high performance, low cost, efficiency), that the manufacture must meet, in terms of decibels, pollutant output, and fuel mileage.  This means sacrificing certain things.    Motorcycles get great fuel economy (due to light weight and smaller engine space) but they are horrible for pollutants in comparison because most don't have catalytic convertors, and some don't even have mufflers.    Sometimes the manufacture just can't or wont make more efficient vehicles because it violates some other limitation such as cost/profit, noise, or pollutant levels."

PeopleBeingJerks,36nw8h,DodneyRangerfield,-8,Thu May 21 10:59:07 2015 UTC,"I love how you're ignoring the belligerent man after a soccer game (maybe under the influence, unless that doesn't happen in other countries) with riot police present.

PeopleBeingJerks,36nw8h,HowGoodIsLoMein,5,Thu May 21 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"First of all, ""riot"" police are present at almost any relevant football/soccer game almost everywhere in Europe, that doesn't mean that there is a riot going on or even if people are fighting across the street away it doesn't mean that these people should be treated like they are part of it. Police are there to stop fights, not start them.  Reactions like this are definitely not ""keeping order"" according to neither the law or usual practice in the EU since it leads to abuse and promotes resentment towards the police which in turn lead to more violent behavior. A cop beating someone who has not shown himself to be physically violent/dangerous is not enforcing the law, he is exacting punishment by his own judgement, something he is neither qualified for nor appointed to do. Force can be used, of course, when a person is resisting arrest or to prevent destructive use of force, not for ""keeping order"" or to reprimand someone for shouting at the cops."

PeopleBeingJerks,36hj1k,DerpSherpa,4,Tue May 19 19:05:48 2015 UTC,The lights on emergency vehicles are blue and red which is the most drawing to the eye. The rate that they flash at is also meant to draw attention immediately as well. I think it would be difficult to miss if one was looking straight at the road or light. By the looks of it though the light turned green so the red car took off so if anything the driver in green was looking down at their phone or something if they were deaf.

I was employed to drive for nine years, driving about a hundred miles a day. Needless to say, there is not enough music on the earth to keep you from going insane. And that would be if our trucks had any sort if media players at all.  They didn't. Not even cassette players. With just the radio even NPR got repetitive, so I listened to podcasts and audio books on my phone. Even with both headphones in I could hear the vehicles around me because talk radio isn't that loud, I could actually hear better than when I rock out to music on the car speakers, but I always left one headphone out for exactly this reason. I didn't want to slow down an EMT and kill someone because I was too interested in that Radio Lab episode about duck penises. But with both headphones in and music playing? You can't hear shit.   All it would take is for that driver to be fiddling with their phone, or invoicing something at red lights to completely miss the sirens.   Moral of the story? Don't be stupid."

It was often so damn staticky I couldn't make out the words and I only had a couple of stations that would get any signal at all.   And how could headphones be illegal? Hell it was required in order for me to talk on my phone at the time. Had to be handsfree. I put a headphone in even when I'm not listening to anything so I can answer the phone when clients call.

(Hopefully your stereo isn't in that awkward band between the end of tape decks and the beginning of aux-in.)  And yes, headphones are illegal while driving, and the reason is emergency sirens.  The law predates cell phones, so people talking hands-free wasn't considered.  It was for walkmans, portable CD players and the like.  Deaf people are used to being observant of their surroundings in place of their hearing, so I imagine a deaf person would have more readily seen the truck.  Plus, not so great to use the existence of a small number of people who can't hear emergency sirens as an excuse for the rest of us to not have to keep our hearing available while driving.  So it probably won't change."

It's all very well to be kind to people down on their luck -- until it starts to negatively affect your business.    This is an unusual case where a paying customer was trying to buy a homeless person food, but I can see how an employee might get confused by this if the restaurant has a 'don't give free food to homeless people' policy in effect."

PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,theseventhredditor,82,Mon May 18 12:54:54 2015 UTC,"The sign above the turnstile has an arrow pointing out, indicating an exit. The women evaded the line for enter by going through the exit."
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,Matthewbim11,-38,Mon May 18 13:45:08 2015 UTC,"Nope. The exit is through the gates with no turnstile even further to the right. The turnstiles are set to go only one direction and the woman, and the woman behind her that entered next, both pushed a turnstile to get in. This guy is trying to exit through an entrance and then tripped this woman who was going the right way. He is a dick."
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,the_THIS_train,22,Mon May 18 14:26:43 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that's the only exit.  I believe that's the entrance/exit for people who can't go through a turnstile such as people in wheelchairs, people with strollers and things like that.  The turnstiles often go both ways, inbound you need to put a ticket through to make it turn, but outbound you just walk through.  The guy is a still a bit of a dick because they both got to the turnstile at the same time.  One of them would have to back out and she was just a bit more forceful about it, most likely because coming in means you have a train to catch while coming out means you're already at your destination.  The fact that he tripped her is pretty shitty of him."
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,barnacledoor,2,Mon May 18 15:19:05 2015 UTC,"The way she walks doesn't look like ""omfg I need to catch that train"" to me. Also at least for me it's kind of a given that if there are two gates and people enter and exit at the same time, each side lines up at one gate."
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,darps,2,Mon May 18 21:02:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, generally you would stay to the right to allow some people to exit while others enter, but I don't know that the woman is being a jerk enough to warrant the guy tripping her."
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,barnacledoor,4,Mon May 18 21:12:17 2015 UTC,"You are right. There are gates just to the right of the turnstiles, and the exit arrow is clearly pointing over the gates.   Take the down votes with pride."
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,SargePants,-6,Tue May 19 00:43:49 2015 UTC,"Idk why you are so downvoted... That arrow is way further right then the turnstile. If you notice the angle,, the arrow would be in front of the gate on the end if anything but it looks like that arrow is for general directions and not a single lane.. People are walking through all THREE turnstiles so it seems that the woman was doing what everyone else was doing. Either way tripping her like that is a jerk move and we CAN'T know for sure who was ""supposed"" to have the right of way."
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,LiquidAsylum,-3,Mon May 18 16:49:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. After the woman who was tripped goes through a steady stream of more people go through. The exit sign in yellow with the arrow IS further to the right than the turnstile. I guess we are they only ones looking at this objectively.
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,the_THIS_train,-7,Mon May 18 17:59:57 2015 UTC,Why is there a guard on only one side of the entering turnstile's?

It's irrelevant who you think is right in this situation, the arrow is clearly for the far right gate. People are that desperate for the woman to be the jerk here they must just be illiterately ignoring that."
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,Hara-Kiri,-10,Mon May 18 22:50:23 2015 UTC,"The man was in the wrong lane because the turnstile only goes one direction and she clearly pushed a turnstile and so does the next lady behind her that comes through. He is supposed to exit through the gates that do not have a turnstile which are on the far right. Not only is he trying to exit through an entrance, he trips a woman for doing what she was supposed to. Fuck this guy."
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,the_THIS_train,4,Mon May 18 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"It depends. In some countries, the turnstiles go both ways. From my experience, they're locked until you pay the fare and then they unlock and you can pass through."
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,blumpkin,4,Mon May 18 15:57:35 2015 UTC,What makes you say the turnstile only goes in one direction? In NYC they go in both directions.
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,BobaFettuccine,4,Mon May 18 16:44:03 2015 UTC,Lack of experience... Lack of experience tells him that turnstiles go in only one direction.
PeopleBeingJerks,36d4fa,CausionEffect,1 point,Mon May 18 19:04:07 2015 UTC,"Even if the gates were for both directions (which doesn't appear to be the case), the fact that it's one person wanting to exit, while a ton of people are coming in to enter, means the woman should have let him pass. Otherwise he'd have to wait for everyone else to enter.  Dude was in the right x2."

They're people, They aren't going to sit on you or break their teeth off in your neck like you people presume. Go fucking do something about it, dick."
PeopleBeingJerks,369rzs,LeLoyon,10,Sun May 17 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"So, all of the fat people (majority posted in fatpeoplehate) want to lose weight? No. Granted, a lot of people on the sub just hate on fat people in general, but the main hate is towards the whole fat acceptance movement, 'big is beautiful', '#effyourbeautystandards', etc."
PeopleBeingJerks,369rzs,McFlumpin,3,Sun May 17 21:44:49 2015 UTC,"You're confusing /r/fatpeoplehate with /r/fatlogic. The latter is what you describe. The former is pure unadulterated hatred, bigotry, and mocking people for the sake of humor in cruelty."
PeopleBeingJerks,369rzs,PmMeYourFatHate,-14,Sun May 17 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"You don't know that. You're just assuming that they don't want to. Unfortunately, I do know a lot of fat people who don't even try, so I get the whole ""judge a book by the cover"" approach that everyone abides by. Should they attempt to lose weight? Of course they should! However, I've noticed that the sub also hates on those who actually do lose weight as well. Mainly because of the excess skin that remains afterwards. You think fat people want to lose weight, and still be judged because of their flappy skin that they have no control over? May as well stay fat if you ask me, even though that's the selfish thing to do in my eyes.   I do agree with a lot of the points that the sub made in the past, in particular the fact that fat people put a dent in the healthcare system. However, I just don't agree with the tactics. They don't do a thing. Fat people know they're fat. Bringing it to their attention isn't going to make them lose weight. Sending them a nutrition guide, perhaps giving them a nice routine to work with and becoming supportive would be the better approach. But, if they don't want to lose weight, they aren't going to lose weight. No amount of hatemongering will ever change that. So I'm at my original point."

However, I still don't quite understand why this girl gets the abuse honestly. She's a child, and kids just don't think about being fat, they don't think about the society, or what's right or wrong. They think about what kind of toy they want. They just want to have a childhood. Let's face it, our lives turn to shit after that's all over anyway."

The kid is fat. I'm no making a value judgment in calling the kid fat. Merely looking at the kid, and saying said kid is fat. Why the objection to saying the kid is fat?"
PeopleBeingJerks,369rzs,witeowl,-3,Sun May 17 17:01:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, I guess I don't have a problem with noticing that this girl is overweight. She clearly is. I freak my students out all the time when I refer to myself as fat and I explain that it's just a descriptor; I don't see it as an insult any more than referring to my hair color or height would be an insult. (Don't get me wrong; I want to lose weight, but that's MY decision just like I might decide to be a redhead instead of blonde.)   But I guess my question would be: Why do we need to say something about it? Why do we need to be dicks and say, ""Well, she really didn't need cake, hur dur."" And really, the bottom line problem is that she and her overweight were the butt of a joke. That's what got me."

And I agree with it. I like extremely dark comedy but draw my own personal line when it involves kids. Maybe it's because I'm a father, but ultimately I don't find humour in making fun of people who don't have a choice in their situation. And kids are naive and I feel as if making fun of them is taking advantage of that naivety. Naivety being one of the most beautiful parts about kids, in my opinion."

PeopleBeingJerks,369rzs,Creature_73L,5,Sun May 17 22:22:36 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry that you had to go through that at such a young age. A diet at nine years old is outrageous.

PeopleBeingJerks,369rzs,Gaggamaggot,3,Sun May 17 22:30:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yeah, causing a kid to view food as something to hoard and hide because it could be taken away at any time is not a good thing. Not to mention – because you already did – the self-esteem issues. I'm working on my cargo hold of baggage. I don't know that I'll ever win the battle, but it's something I'm not giving up on.  For the record: I'm not one for blaming my parents. They did the best they could with the knowledge they had. I love them dearly, flaws and all, and I know that everything they did, they did with love and the best intentions. At this point in time I'm just angry at my screwed up brain for not being able to get over it and stop some of the thoughts and behaviors that stem from my childhood perception of the world. I mean, seriously, brain, let it go!"
PeopleBeingJerks,369rzs,sulopejur-2,0,Sun May 17 22:53:39 2015 UTC,"and instill a nice healthy sense of disordered eating.   Does it count as ""disordered eating"" when you eat too much?"
PeopleBeingJerks,369rzs,witeowl,1 point,Sun May 17 23:05:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know whether you're being serious or flippant, but I'll assume the former:  I think it's a fine line. There's ""eat too much"" as in not paying attention to what goes in your mouth and just not caring about a few extra pounds. And then there's ""eat too much"" as in a disturbing level of self-sabotage which is likely indicative of underlying issues that need to be resolved despite caring very much about more than a few extra pounds. I don't think it applies to all overweight people, but for more than a few significantly overweight people, I think overeating stems from the same issues as anorexia or bulimia; it just manifests differently.   In my case, for example, I swing between obsessive levels of calorie counting and exercise... and ""fuck you, world"" levels of crap eating and even binging (no purging... unless you count the purge that happens when I swing back to the other side). It's hard for me to see how my behaviors aren't just as harmful as anorexia or bulimia and why they aren't treated with the same level of sensitivity and empathy rather than ""put down the fork, fattie"". In my case, I think both sides of my behavioral spectrum come from a desire for power and control stemming from childhood events such as traumatic family issues I couldn't prevent and compounded just a bit by being put on a diet way too young by a mother who was way too concerned about my weight. Coincidentally(???), this desire for power and control is often an underlying issue with anorexia or bulimia, and this is why people trying to ""help"" me by making comments about how and what I eat is actually very destructive.  And you know what else? I think ""my case"" isn't all that unique. Which I guess is why I'm pretty sensitive about fat people hate."
PeopleBeingJerks,369rzs,sulopejur-2,3,Sun May 17 23:13:10 2015 UTC,"You're right about your case not being unique. Most of the obese (rather than just a bit overweight) people I know have serious problems with their relationship with food. Some bingers, some who were raised to view food as a reward, some who use it as an escape from parents, etc etc."

PeopleBeingJerks,367716,VismundxCygnus,2,Sat May 16 22:30:46 2015 UTC,There was a guy in the source video who seriously considered hitting it with the big hockey stick he was carrying.

PeopleBeingJerks,367716,nate800,1 point,Sat May 16 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"If you watch the full video, they pull this prank on a group of guys walking with hockey gear.  Most of the group takes off, but one guy grabs his stick and winds up like he is going to take a swing at the ""demon"".  The video cuts off as the guy is starting to wind up, so I assume they run in and stop him, but he would have probably permanently injured or killed that person had he hit them."

If he steps out of the box and is in the catcher's way, it's interference. The batters box is his territory and is entitled to stay there. The catcher seems to have done this on purpose because of how low he drops his arm (a normal throw from a catcher would be more over top) and that's why he's a jerk"
PeopleBeingJerks,35iagi,PM-ME-UR-ART,10,Sun May 10 20:41:35 2015 UTC,So what would be the umpires call?

PeopleBeingJerks,35iagi,PM-ME-UR-ART,18,Sun May 10 21:09:09 2015 UTC,There's no unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in baseball?

Of course the umpires can give warnings to both sides or eject players if they think it is warranted. But in this situation there wasn't anything blatant enough for the umpire to throw the catcher out of the game, as the catcher could argue he was only trying to throw the ball"
PeopleBeingJerks,35iagi,PM-ME-UR-ART,3,Mon May 11 00:05:30 2015 UTC,So if I decided to be a jerk too. Would it be legal for me to maybe hit the catcher on his face when I 'bring the bat back' after a 'missed swing?'

PeopleBeingJerks,35iagi,saintheels,1 point,Mon May 11 04:38:25 2015 UTC,Its not interference if the contact happens on the back swing. It happened recently in one my games the batter let his right hand off the bat and did an exaggerated back swing and smacked our catcher in the side of the head. Nothing was called because it didn't effect any plays.
PeopleBeingJerks,35iagi,I-Shit-You-Not,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:58:34 2015 UTC,"I mean technically yes but it certainly depends how it happens.  If you swung and hit the catcher during ""the normal flow of a game"" then yes it would be the catchers fault because he would be out of position (too far up towards the pitcher) and you'd get to go to first base.  But if he was playing his position normally and you were being a jerk and going out of your way to overextend or make an unnatural swing that clearly results in you hitting him, you'd be ejected from the game for trying to pull something like that."
PeopleBeingJerks,35iagi,terpfan1336,1 point,Mon May 11 06:17:49 2015 UTC,"it would be like the same situation essentially. you would have done it after the pitch so it wouldn't be catcher's interference, but it doesn't really affect the play at all. Although since it would have happened right after the catcher killing your appendix, the umpire would definitely give warnings to both sides after that, if he hadn't already. If he had already, you're probably out of the game"

What she lit was just fumes and maybe some gas that has leaked when putting it in the car. Pulling it out without turning off the pump handle is what made the fire spread because the car owner just added a bunch of gasoline to the fire, instead of letting the fumes burn out.   There is also fire extinguishers by the pumps and an emergency shutoff right on the pumps.  The emergency button I think also fills the area with a fire extinguishing chemical.   I am not an expert."

PeopleBeingJerks,3455ts,GingerMarimbist,-3,Sun May 24 09:40:59 2015 UTC,I think she slipped up because the black sister is just so pretty and the white sister is a bit awkward looking.  IMHO.  Maybe she was just trying to make her feel good?  I give her a pass.

PeopleBeingJerks,3455ts,Panagoman,8,Tue Apr 28 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point. It's racist because she thinks that looking white is a compliment, not because she was trying to be mean. Having light skin does not equate to looking good. That's why it's racist."

PeopleBeingJerks,3455ts,Lazerkatz,5,Wed Apr 29 00:52:31 2015 UTC,It isn't racist to like white. It's racist to view white as better than black.  You can still like white.

PeopleBeingJerks,3455ts,italianradio,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:45:20 2015 UTC,"People in Australia have always worshipped tanned skin. People will bake themselves in the sun and risk getting skin cancer in order to get it. Lately there has been a backlash against this and the media is trying to discourage tanning and promote pale skin. Skin cancer rates are very high in Australia. The attitude is ""If you naturally have darker skin, without tanning then lucky you but if you aren't naturally darker, then embrace your pale skin and recognise that pale skin can be beautiful too."" Also, in the past, people with red hair, pale skin and freckles have copped a lot of bullying and have been made fun of. Again, the media has tried to discourage this.  I can't know for sure what that woman's intention was when she made that comment, she could have said it to be racist but I doubt it, she would lose her job if that were her intention. She was probably trying to adopt the attitude I mentioned above and it came out wrong.  You got a lot of down voted because redditors love to jump to conclusions without actually trying to understand the situation. You at least tried to understand the situation and the redditors didn't like the fact that you thought for yourself instead of joining the hive mind."

We definitely have racists here, and they can be quite loud about it but the majority of people don't care what your heritage is or whether you are mixed race or not."

PeopleBeingJerks,340uyd,dabluebunny,7,Mon Apr 27 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but(a nice butt firm one) as someone who has been in the truckers situation you slow down and take the shoulder, and stop if you have to. That pick up now has to block 2 lanes, and 1.25 lanes worth of shoulder (That's 3.25 lanes for you math junkies out there, and at ~12ft per average lane width the pickup now must block ~39ft worth roadway with his ~8ft wide truck vs the original ~15ft). Let them hash it out on their own. I always let people in, because everyone wants to be in front and the 10th of a second I save racing head of them and (possibly) getting in a wreck isn't worth the toilet paper my grave digger wipes his ass with. I am not attacking the trucker. The trucker did what he should have done in the first place by slowing down, and shit happens too fast on the highway. Just a ex highway maintenance worker putting in my 2 cents you all pay lol. Drive defensively, have outs, and don't be scared to think outside the box.

PeopleBeingJerks,340uyd,disgustipated,14,Mon Apr 27 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"Keep Right Except To Pass.... no one is obeying this basic rule, and it's set up a situation where the pickup truck creates a real hazard, blocking the Camaro.  When you look down traffic as the truck moves over, there was only one other car in front within a reasonable distance.  I am not standing up for the Camaro driver, I just don't understand why it's important to block him. Sure, he might be driving like a jerk, but why get involved in his jerkfest? And are you sure he was just being a dick, was there a reason for his need to get somewhere faster than the pickup driver?  I used to drive a sports car years ago. Sure, there were times I was a dick, but there was also a time I wanted to get home as fast as I could because my wife was unconscious and unresponsive.  I'm glad no one tried to block me and play Speed Limit Cop (she had liver failure and was in a hepatic coma for 11 weeks). I just hope the Camaro driver wasn't facing a similar situation, on the way to a tragic event involving a loved one.  All I'm saying is, other than the Camaro driver, no one in this video knows why he was in a hurry, and to actively participate in holding him up is stupid and dangerous.  If he's an idiot, let him by and let him out of your life. No need to increase your frustration and anger by blocking him.  And look what good it did. Major accident, multiple vehicles because one guy in the pickup got pissed that the Camaro was going to get somewhere first. Though the Camaro might be a jerk, the pickup driver just as responsible for the accident.   And, for the camera car, I wonder if it was the same - him tailgating with his signal on, trying to get by? Why didn't anyone move over? There were plenty of keep right gaps between the big trucks."

You never know what kind of person you're pissing off on the road.  You never know what kind of risk you are causing to yourself and others by doing this stuff.  As much as people want to tell themselves, ""If I let him go by me, I'm just rewarding his asshole behavior"" we also need to realize that our job, as drivers, is to drive as safe as we can, eliminate risk for ourselves and other drivers and follow the rules of the road.  If someone else is being a dick, that doesn't give you free license to be a dick as well.  Just get out of their way and hope that they get away from you without putting you at risk."

PeopleBeingJerks,340uyd,disgustipated,3,Mon Apr 27 15:49:07 2015 UTC,"When the Camaro attempted to pass from the right lane, the pickup driver sped up and cut him off, then he paced the semi truck in order to block the Camaro from passing. An obviously intentional move meant to impede the Camaro's progress (and as I mentioned elsewhere, I'm not sticking up for the Camaro driver).  Regardless of the reason (or excuse) the Camaro driver had for traveling faster than the pickup, the pickup's driver dramatically increased the probability for an accident by not allowing the Camaro by.  Maintaining speed in the left lane when a faster car is behind you is also known as Failure to Yield, and there are laws on the books just like speed limit laws.  The laws do not state that a driver has to discern whether a faster vehicle is traveling over the speed limit and if it's okay to block the passing lane; if you're traveling next to another vehicle in the passing lane on a US Interstate like this, you're disobeying one of the most fundamental safety laws out there: Keep Right Except to Pass. Everything from car/truck speed differential calculations to location and spacing of exits is based off the fact that slower traffic keeps right, and faster/passing traffic moves to the left.  It's the difference between, ""the guy in the Camaro is an asshole and I'm going to intentionally block him"" vs ""the guy in the Camaro is in a hurry and I'm blocking the passing lane.""  Also, keep in mind we really don't know what the speed limits here are (I watched but didn't see any signs). On many stretches of interstate, it's common for passenger vehicles to have a higher limit than semi trucks. So, if this was a 75/65 split speed limit, then the pickup truck was actually driving below the speed limit.  I'll watch again later when I have time to see if I can pick up the actual limit."
PeopleBeingJerks,340uyd,FormerFastCat,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"I watched it again... I see the Camaro try to cut the truck off and the truck holding its ground and then avoiding the collusion. It looks like the Camaro lets off the gas to avoid hitting the 18 wheeler here and attempts to merge into the left lane at the same time. I also see that the truck and the car filming this are tailgating the unknown vehicle in front of them. Not saying any parties are innocent here, but I don't blame the truck driver for not jamming on the brakes. He would have gotten rear-ended and maybe have still made contact with the Camaro."
PeopleBeingJerks,340uyd,barnacledoor,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:43:37 2015 UTC,"There are 2 things that the pickup driver could've done to avoid escalating this situation.  First, he could've just let the Camaro driver pull in from the right.  The pickup didn't just hold his ground, but sped up to prevent the car from coming in.  Second, he could've passed the truck and gotten out of his way.  When the Camaro was coming up on the right, the pickup was pretty close to the car in front of him.  By the time the car comes up on the shoulder and causes the accident, that leading car is long gone.  That means the pickup was no longer keeping pace with traffic, but was instead keeping pace with the truck in the right lane.  Many of us have been guilty of this same sort of shit and have been lucky that it hasn't escalated to this point.  Now, I try to be more conscious of what could happen.  What is my point in slowing down the guy behind me?  Who made me the official traffic speed mediator?  Will I be more stressed if I stay in front of him or get out of the way?  Will it greatly affect my commute to get out of the way?  I can't say that I've ever had a case where the answers to those questions justify staying in someone's way.  I usually try to get past the people in the right lane and move over to let them past...  usually..."
PeopleBeingJerks,340uyd,Drekken-,2,Mon Apr 27 20:12:27 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me?

PeopleBeingJerks,340uyd,disgustipated,0,Mon Apr 27 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"Blindly adhering to laws and ignoring the relevant situation is dangerous.  If you practice situational awareness, then you would know that impeding the passing lane creates multiple potential hazards (that sadly were realized in the above video).  Why was the Camaro speeding? Was it in response to a life-death issue? Was he late for work and just being a dick? Was he an undercover/off-duty cop responding to a call? My point is, you don't know why he was speeding, and by intentionally blocking him as the pickup did (note that the pickup sped up and closed the gap when the Camaro tried to pass), instead of defusing a potentially dangerous situation, he initiated one. There are also laws about impeding the flow of traffic. And, as for your point regarding no passing lanes, this is obviously a US federal interstate, and the white dotted lines are proof that it is a legal passing area.  So, was the Camaro speeding? Probably, though hard to verify without seeing a speedometer, or knowing the local speed limit. What if this is an area where the speed limit is 75 for cars and 65 for trucks?  The cars in the left lane would then be traveling below the speed limit.  I'm not standing up for the Camaro driver; I'm pointing out that intentionally blocking the passing lane to ""punish"" another driver is a good way to end up dead."

By your worthless logic you can just drive like a total dick if you have some pressing issue that awaits. You say keep right unless passing. Well then your wife can wait for the proper authorities to come to her assistance...Oh wait they can't get to her because some asshole who thinks it's ok to turn the highway into his own personal emergency road clogged it up with a major accident.

Which of course didn't happen, but thanks for projecting your own fantasy on my grievous situation. I arrived just before the ambulance. It took them over 20 minutes.  My point is that YOU DON'T KNOW WHY the car is speeding. Is it a crazy guy with a gun going to kill his ex and he decides to shoot you instead? Is it an undercover or off-duty cop on his way to an emergency call?  Let me ask you this: is this your normal conversational tone, or do you get this angry all the time?

PeopleBeingJerks,340uyd,disgustipated,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"When someone spews the nonsense you did it does get me upset.    It's not nonsense. The pickup obviously attempted to block the Camaro. It's the ""I'll be damned..."" attitude, as in ""I'm driving the legal speed limit in the left lane next to this big truck, I'll be damned if I'm going to move over for that car behind me.""  or ""I'll be damned if I'm going to dim my headlights if that oncoming car won't, either.""  What a way to make a situation worse.   not to mention that you said I was projecting my own fantasy by projecting your own fantasy with the whole gun explanation.    I gave a specific example as to why a driver might be in a hurry.  You responded with, ""well then your wife can wait..."".  The ""whole gun explanation"" was one of several examples I've given in this post and others as to why the Camaro driver might have been speeding.  It's definitely not a fantasy of mine, just another example, like the off-duty cop one.   Listen everyone did something wrong if you want to talk about the letter of the law but without question the camaro driver was the instigator.   Everybody but the trucker.  It's all about managing potential hazards, and reducing the probability for accidents.  Even if the Camaro instigated this, the pickup truck driver escalated the situation by not giving the right-of-way.    Even if there were no other vehicles but the pickup and semi, the pickup driver is creating a significant potential hazard by driving next to the trucker. He's taking away a potential escape route, and causing the truck driver to divert his focus from the road ahead so he can watch a vehicle that is maintaining in his blind spot.   When he is in front of the judge no my with was sick or the other drivers should have yield to me explanation will do.   Your sentence doesn't make much sense, but I'll try:  Are you saying, ""When he's in front of the judge and he says, ""no, my wife was sick and the other drivers should yield...""   I knew when I posted my anecdote that someone would turn it around on me. Regardless of my reason, what was the Camaro's reason? Honestly, you don't know, do you?  So what would court be like?  Hard to surmise since you don't have even the most basic information from anyone involved.  Driving next to a big truck creates multiple potential hazards. Flying up someone's ass and trying to force them out of the way does, too.  Yeah, maybe everybody is at fault in this, but it could have easily and safely been resolved by either 1) the Camaro driver not being in a hurry; or 2) the pickup truck driver not promoting such a dangerous situation."

(WKBW) - A Chevy Camaro cuts onto the shoulder of I-90 in an attempt to pass a pickup truck, but the driver loses control and slams into the truck, which gets shoved into a tractor trailer.  Tim Linton captured the wreck near Batavia last week Tuesday on a dash cam he had recently purchased. He posted the video to YouTube. Fast forward to 2:16:  State Police charged the driver of the Camaro, 32-year-old Kiran Thapa of Columbus, Ohio with aggravated DWI. Troopers say his BAC was .19 percent.  Thapa is also facing multiple traffic infractions and first degree aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.  He was taken to the Genesee County Jail on $2,500 bail."

The other day this guy was driving a mustang on the highway as I was bringing my brother home from school. He was so close to my rear fender that I could see his face perfectly. He was also in between the left lane and the middle lane. My hope was that I was going to merge a long distance from my exit, but in order to do that safely I sped up so I wouldn't cut him off in a way because I was never sure where he was going to go.   As soon as I sped up, he maintained distance and was still right behind me. I didn't know what to do. Then as we went around this turn I just tapped my brake lights hoping he would back up. He didn't. Instead he flew past me and a bunch of other cars and pulled right next to me. He rolled down his window and kept telling me to pull over. I looked at him and then looked back at the road hoping he would just lose interest. Then my brother pulled his seat up and the dude flew past me and started tailgating someone else.  If that guy got in an accident with me, why should I be blamed. I didn't know what to do and I was trying to get away from he guy.  Then again, this dude was trying to trap the camaro. Which isn't great but it isn't worth nearly the same penalty. The camaro driver should've slowed down instead of getting so pissed. He was obviously trying to instigate with the flashing lights and every too."

PeopleBeingJerks,33y5zl,nordoceltic,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"You know based on another thread here, I wonder if the state is using Agent Provocateurs to cause all this trouble....so they can continue to legitimize their brutal exploitation of Black America both for fines and the profits of the privatized prison system.   IMO Black America must made education a priority for its communities.  Traditionally education is low in poor black communities, and with that ignorance comes ignorance to the tools citizens can use to protect themselves from exploitation by the authorities.   Doubly so since IMO black community schools are intentionally neglected because its continues to the serve a ""soft"" racist agenda in 21st century.   AKA the rich, white establishment realizes they cannot directly oppress the blacks, so they seek to both distract and marginalize them instead.  Trust me it only helps advance the wishes of the racist 0.5%ers to see young black youth obsessed with rap and sport stars instead of stuff like civil engineering, international business, literature, or rocket science.    And the marginalizing?  I mean I watch the news.  I don't think they could get any more racist without having to resort to using the n-word.   I mean when the City of Ferguson told the FPD to go collect ticket money, why do you think the Chief decided to target poor black people?    I can only imagine the lawsuit storm that would have resulted in trying to run that racket on educated suburban white people.    I mean poverty does limit access to lawyers, but there ARE pro-bono lawyers and people all over the USA very interested in assisting black communities....  Being educated does help one realize they can draw on such resources.     That and you guys must shuck Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson.  Both are bastards who are using your plight to grow stinking filthy rich and have no interest at all in helping their fellow black man.   The fact that both are darlings of the racist media should say more than enough there.    One last question....as a white man, how could I help?   I want to help, but I fear that the color of my skin invalidates my voice to the issue.  I feel like many of fellow pro-black whites think the same way.    Very vocal white-haters seem very quick to shoot down white people which robs the Black Community of much needed white allies."

That and local churches. Those leaders do shun Jackson and Sharpton, But on the internet and especially Reddit, you will only find hateful spiteful white kids who grab rhetoric and run, not much to do her w/o being labelled a Fox News analyst.   Problem is many (not all) in the Democrat Party do exactly as you state, keep us reliant on entitlement programs so that they live a unfulfilled but easy life, and that goes for poor white/asian/hispanic people as well. It's EASY to sell hope and hate, it is much harder to sell accountability and responsibility  Yes, the black community must do better but there are more of us in poverty and everyone has to ask why  Lastly, as for the legal system, more black males in poverty mean more black males in prison...the legal system is a Class issue, if you are rich, you have a great chance of getting off, or getting a slap on the wrist, look at black athletes. But if you are poor, assigned attorneys don't care about you and you are guilty until proven innocent"

PeopleBeingJerks,33y5zl,Mackelday,5,Mon Apr 27 02:24:13 2015 UTC,I don't think it's racism as much as statistical fact.  Black people are relatively more poor   Black people are relatively less educated   Black people are relatively more violent   One can't claim that all people of a race follow such claims because that's statistically inaccurate. However it does appear that the looters in the video (not all black people) fall in with this information.

They grow up in that bad neighborhood with other people their age also in the same situation, so they learn their behavior from their shitty environment. It has nothing to do with their skin color, but everything to do with where and how they were raised. You could say the same about a predominantly white neighborhood that's shitty, it'd be white people robbing the store. Unfortunately, it's just more likely to be black people because there are more of them growing up in bad neighborhoods.

PeopleBeingJerks,33y5zl,oij21iop4j,2,Sat May 2 22:59:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure of the legality, but during the L.A. Riots there were store owners who barricaded the entrance of their store and stood on the roof with rifles and shotguns to deter people from looting their store."
PeopleBeingJerks,33y5zl,feralkitten,3,Sun Apr 26 23:03:39 2015 UTC,"It is not.  To fire a gun you need to believe your life is in immediate danger.  From there, state law determines whether you also must have had no way out of the situation except for deadly force, or whether you're allowed to defend yourself even if you may have had the option of removing yourself from the situation.  (""Stand your ground"" laws.)  So, the store owners are completely helpless here.  Sadly, they rely completely on the police and can't really do much on their own to stop it."

PeopleBeingJerks,33y5zl,TheMegaBenson,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:42:12 2015 UTC,"I think the difference lies between punishment and consequences. If the state catches you stealing, then NO you should not be executed. That is not equal punishment for the crime.  However if a young child is playing in the road and gets killed, that is a direct consequence of their own actions. The state didn't sentence the child to death for playing in the road. BUT playing in the road could easily result in death.  I think if the state finds the looters, they should go to jail. But if i were a store owner, i would protect myself and my livelihood with firearms. If someone gets shot while robbing the store, it is simply a direct consequence of their own actions."

F1 cars have a starter on the back of the car that they use a lil machine to crank the engine and start it. The bikes are started in the pit lane and they roll off to do the lap. Thats why the guy got so mad about his bike being turned off by the other rider, he cant start it back up on the track.  F1 cars also dont have a normal clutch, same thing. You start the car at the beginning of the session and go run. Same thing, if your car dies/stalls/whatever on track, you gotta get a lift for you and the car back to your garage. Which could mean your race or the weekend is shot for you. These are top of the line and most technologically advanced bikes/cars in the world. They dont subscribe to normal things. They dont need starters, you crank the engine to start and its going until it dies or you turn it off. F1 engines are seized up and have to have warm liquid to warm the engine before it even can start."

PeopleBeingJerks,33eevl,volcomsnow909,3,Tue Apr 21 22:30:29 2015 UTC,Is it a weight issue or is it because the engines aren't able to handle a traditional stater?
PeopleBeingJerks,33eevl,CaptainGo,3,Wed Apr 22 18:45:53 2015 UTC,Probably a weight thing. Every gram counts and a heavy starter motor is a lot of grams. A starter would also require a bigger battery.

All a starter does is pretty much much turn over the flywheel which is in between the transmission and the engine. By pushing the bike or pushing a car down a hill and letting your foot off the clutch while in gear, it transfer the energy from the transmission since it's rolling into the engine to get it to turn over."

Most likely if you were to pull up while it was your green, they would eventually move and once they finally do, even if the light is yellow or red, you have to get out of the intersection so you have the right of way."
PeopleBeingJerks,33b6p2,pfafulous,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:38:31 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that they're asshats.  But if you pull into the intersection, what if they aren't clear by the time you turn red?  It's not the same thing as pulling into the middle for a left turn, because that relies on the assumption that people will leave the box clear.  Once they've violated that rule, the situation has changed."
PeopleBeingJerks,33b6p2,Leetzers,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:07:13 2015 UTC,"If they aren't clear then the people behind them aren't going to be moving either. They're still stuck and youre still stuck. If they move and your'e in the intersection, you just go forward since you need to get out of the intersection.  Again, you're not doing the same thing they are doing. They're blocking the intersection because they went even though it was full on the other side. You're blocking the intersection because you're waiting for them to clear the intersection. More than likely only one car can pull up to these cars blocking the intersection anyways, so if it's a red and it clears out, then they only have to wait for one car to clear the intersection. It's probably going be one car blocking the intersection if they did pull up to these cars, if it turns red, I'm sure they'll wait for one car to get out of the intersection.   edit: just wanted to add that you're allowed to be in the intersection as long as its green and clear were you are headed. It's not allowed to be in the intersection while it's obviously backed up. You have to get out of the intersection when it is red."
PeopleBeingJerks,33b6p2,pfafulous,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, my point is that it's not clear, and you don't know when it will be clear again. It doesn't matter who started it. It doesn't matter that it might be clear eventually. That's exactly the thinking that got us here in the first place.  Maybe the reason it's backed up is because of an emergency. Now you're willfully creating a worse traffic jam and making it more difficult for an ambulance. My pride is not more important than someone's life. What if it were a family member of yours in the ambulance? Would you want me blocking the intersection?"
PeopleBeingJerks,33b6p2,c14kaa,4,Sat Apr 25 21:17:33 2015 UTC,"Introduce you local road authority to this. It will blow their minds.    Where stationary traffic would be likely to block a junction, a yellow box may be marked on the road, covering all or part of the junction. You must not enter the box if your exit is not clear. If turning right at the junction, you may enter the box (behind other right-turning vehicles, if any) to wait for a gap in the oncoming traffic, but only if the right-turn exit is clear"

Perhaps we raise our sons not to rape instead of blaming a lady for showing too much cleavage. Because no matter how she dresses, people will still rape. People were raping women in the Victorian era when women wore clothes covering every inch of their body. Blaming a women for the way she dresses has nothing to do with why she was raped. And you're comparing that to a guy wearing clothing that signifies they belong to a hate group. That is why your analogy fails."

I don't want to be associated with the KKK, so I don't walk around in public looking like the KKK. If you don't want undue sexual attention, don't go in public dressed like a skank and expect people to not think thats what you want, especially when around drunk idiots at a bar or party. I don't expect random people in public to act with any sense of decorum because there's always been assholes and there always will be. I can't control other peoples actions, but I can control mine and minimize my risk of being victimized rather than crossing my fingers and hoping everyone is going to behave themselves. Even good people do really shitty stuff sometimes, and I'd rather trust myself to keep me out of situations than trust everyone else not to thrust me into one"

At some point.  There will be a problem, when your in the wrong place at the wrong time.  That is all.  Both equally have the right to do both, but I think nobody will be surprised when the person wearing the ""fuck the police."" saying is assaulted, or harrassed.  Not that sexual assault or assault arn't surprising when it happens, its that most people would say ""don;t mess with cops"" or "" just play along, so you dont cause trouble.""  but saying anything like that for the other situation is apparently unjustifiable.  In the end all im saying is when you go outside you take risks.  This time the lambo lost. What you risk is your choice.  Not that someone driving over your lambo is justified.

Now tell me how telling someone not to wear a ""fuck you pigs"" shirt is different than tell someone to dress modestly.  Both have the right to wear whatever they like without persecution right? so why would it be morally acceptable for one and not the other? People would expect cops to be angry and harrass you for it, yet when another group harasses its a different story.  There needs to be a correlation in rage.  I don't think my logic was a stretch of the imagination, and by all default everyone should be aware of the bad things that can happen to them or their possessions while in a public place.  Is that a bad thing? when was protecting yourself, and being aware a bad thing?  Not that we should have to do those things, but that we should do them for as people would say realpolitic reasons."
PeopleBeingJerks,33b4df,cgKush,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:56:53 2015 UTC,"It's a bit different. One is purposefully angering the other party, so they get angry. A girl dressing provocatively shouldn't make someone angry with you. It may make them attracted to you, but should not make them attack you. They should know how to control themselves. And before you say it, yes, the cop should know how to control himself too, but you wearing the fuck you shirt in front of him is you being an asshole. Dressing sexy is not you being an asshole, it doesn't feel like an attack on anyone. I get your point about like, wearing a Rolex in the projects. But people see rape differently. It is a much worse offense to rape someone than to take their money or Jewlery.  If I was a girl, realistically I would probably dress down if I went to an area I didn't feel safe. But they are still not the one who gets blamed for a rape. Definitely not the first person you blame. And this guy didn't drive his car into the projects, he parked it outside of a nice restaurant."

PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,joephusweberr,5,Sat Apr 18 05:56:54 2015 UTC,"If you watch the video, they had both just passed a truck parked on the side of the road. I agree the jerky movement of the car looks intentional, but it's possible he just wanted to pull a little farther back in to the right. Maybe he saw someone in the opposite direction and thought ""yeah, now's a good time to get out of the way"".  I know it's kind of reaching, but it could be hard to prove malicious intent."

PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,joephusweberr,-2,Sat Apr 18 06:41:44 2015 UTC,The video shows license plates of several vehicles.  I don't get how that means one of them is guilty.

The swerve looks to me like an intentional maneuver in which the driver's aim was to hit the motorcyclist and send him off his path. The inclusion of the license plate in the video implies that the car didn't stop, pointing to their intentions."
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,joephusweberr,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:17:01 2015 UTC,Dude watch the video. It can clearly be seen that the car was trying to pass the car that was slowing and down and braking in front of him. More than likely he didn't notice the motorcycle.
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,ConquistaToro,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"That probably depends on local law.  It is extremely common in some places in the US, to the point where I struggle to believe it could be illegal.  If it is, no one seems to know about it.  I grew up in a city where this is expected behavior, took drivers ed there, etc.  Never heard of it being illegal.  Not to say it couldn't be, but it is definitely possible this driver has no idea about it."
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,lodc,2,Tue Apr 21 01:37:25 2015 UTC,Never heard of it being illegal.    Passing another car on the right hand side?? That is very much illegal where I live.

PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,yaix,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no.   Then the car maybe wanted to park.   Yeah, unless you are fucking insane you are going to slow down a bit before tailing off to the side and parking.   What the fuck is the motorbike doing overtaking   Lane-splitting as a motorcycle is legal and common practice.   on the parking lane,   Do you see a divider?   well over speed limit?   You can't possibly know what the speed limit is or how fast the motorcycle is going.   If its a parking lane,   Which you can't tell   then its even more conceivable that the car didn't se the bike.   *see. And even if it were a parking lane, you are supposed to check your mirrors and put on your blinkers before changing lanes. Otherwise there would be no reason for the car to make such a sudden turn unless they weren't paying attention or they were trying to hit the biker.  EDIT: Now that I watch the video again, even if they weren't paying attention, there are no obstacles on the road that would have warranted such a violent turn. So my guess would be that there is a 99% chance that it was intentional, and a 1% chance that the driver is in fact a German shepherd or someone of similarly proportionate driving ability."
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,secretarabman,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:10:59 2015 UTC,Here's the original comment we're both commenting under. I contend that the driver's actions were intentional.
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,joephusweberr,0,Tue Apr 21 01:26:34 2015 UTC,"Hardly. The dude overtakes on the right, so the car obviously didn't see him. The motorbike dude is a fucking idiot and hope he learned from trashing his bike."
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,yaix,9,Sat Apr 18 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like the car was changing lanes to overtake and didn't see the bike in its blind spot. However, as a motorcycle rider myself, I feel that when you are on a bike you are the only one responsible for your safety. He could see that there was a slow travelling car up ahead, and should have known that cars behind it are likely to want to overtake, and so should have been weary that this was going to happen.  For insurance purposes, the car is at fault, but the motorcycle rider can only blame himself."

PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,DylanJaimz1,5,Sat Apr 18 03:21:24 2015 UTC,Did the car purposefully swerve at the bike or just change lanes into the bike passing illegally?
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,barnacledoor,24,Sat Apr 18 01:16:18 2015 UTC,Both. The bike looks like he is passing illegally.  The car is attempting murder.
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,scottyb83,6,Sat Apr 18 03:01:10 2015 UTC,"It's more clear in the full video. There is a third vehicle stopping in front of them.  In some cities they have really wide lanes and it's pretty normal to go around someone turning left by passing them on the right.  I could easily see this being what happened here.. bike passes on right, then car also decides to pass on the right."
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,lodc,2,Sat Apr 18 02:46:16 2015 UTC,Yeah possibly. I can't see a turning signal on the car in front of them (though that wouldn't surprise me either.)
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,scottyb83,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"As far as I know passing on the right can be considered aggressive driving...passing someone on the right in the same lane has to be illegal. The car is pretty clearly acting out in road rage, though if not for the camera footage he could simply claim that he didn't see him. You don't exactly expect to be passed like that.   In the end, both are idiots, don't act like a fucking toddler behind the wheel of a car. And especially don't do it on a bike."
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,micmea1,2,Sat Apr 18 16:19:28 2015 UTC,Totally agree. The care MIGHT have really not seen him but I highly doubt it. Maybe if he was changing lanes but there was no other lane for the car to go into. The only possibility is that maybe he was trying to pull over to the side of the road and saw the bike at the last second....but I doubt it.
PeopleBeingJerks,32zh53,scottyb83,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:15:04 2015 UTC,"in some places, like california, bikes are supposed to pass on non lanes. driving down the lines seperating lanes.   you aren't supposed to pass on the right of the right most lane though. if there is only one lane, you don't expect to be passed by someone other than one you pass (like a bicyclist). so if something juts out into the road, you could swerve in reaction, not realizing another person is doing something wrong."

I drive a fairly small car and I could also drive on the margin, but I don't. I don't do it because this is a very likely outcome.       I don't know if the car was trying to pull over, pass the other car, or just run the bike off the road, but no matter what the intent was, the outcome was the same, and the odds of this happening don't change.

Of course the license would be denied. There is no way he would meet the city planning requirements for such a business. Parking, sewage, safety & ADA requirements, traffic impact not to mention the precedent it would set. He is trying to do a good thing but he went about doing it in the wrong way.

This is because if I try to find parking it will typically be 4-7 minutes away walking wise. When we get a 911 call our policy states we have to be in the ambulance and in route to the scene within 1 minute of getting a call. I would say, in my experience, I dont get to get my food or eat 15% of the time because I'll get a call after I've already ordered my food or just got it.

He began his career on newspapers in Kentucky and Ohio, winning numerous awards and building a strong reputation for investigative writing. Hired by the San Jose Mercury News, Webb contributed to the paper's Pulitzer-prize winning coverage of the Loma Prieta earthquake. Webb is best known for his ""Dark Alliance"" series, which appeared in the Mercury News in 1996. The series examined the origins of the crack-cocaine trade in Los Angeles and claimed that members of the anti-government Contra rebels in Nicaragua had played a major role in creating the trade, using cocaine profits to support their struggle. It also suggested that they may have acted with the knowledge and protection of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The series provoked outrage in Los Angeles, particularly in the African-American community, and led to four major investigations of the series' charges.

PeopleBeingJerks,30ks6y,witeowl,0,Sat Mar 28 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately on mobile so I don't have a link, but it turns out the weapons do launch the cap upon firing. This being said, I can agree with you even without the cap being fired it does seem somewhat unnecessary to have the end of the barrel that near the faces of anyone while you're firing smoke and dust.  At the end of the day, all I want to see in this sort of setting is the lack of escalation to such a point. At such a point though, in my opinion, we should be careful to hold blame to one side or the other until facts come out instead of sensationalizing a story despite which side you would like to be on."

They were protesting two years ago to get lower tuition when they were the lowest in Canada. Now, they are protesting for no apparent reasons. It seems as though it's not the majority of students that want to protest this time, but somehow they went on strike. I was from Quebec, studying in Ontario now. I am so glad I don't live in the the scummiest province in Canada. These students protesting are the fucking scum of the world and they deserve to be fucking shot in the face with tear gas."

I mean i'm in the absolutely insane group that thinks college should be free...so maybe guess i deserve a shot of acidic/caustic propellent shot directly into my face a point blank rang....at a protest where i'm peacefully trying to demonstrate my values."

I'm completely against their reasons for protesting, but if you do want to protest... fine, but don't disrupt all of the students that actually want to educate themselves and learn. and /u/correlatedfish, peacefully is the farthest thing for what is actually happening... so in my opinion, if you were disrupting my right to access education, you deserve to get shot in the god damn face for wanting unrealistic things. How many countries have free education... not a whole fucking lot. The government is paying a big enough chunk of your education so you can get through your degree. Especially in Quebec where students have to pay less in one year than we have to pay in one semester, shut your mouth, pay your education and go to class without taking that right away from all the students that actually want to learn."

PeopleBeingJerks,300ch1,Proxystarkilla,2,Tue Apr 21 05:23:31 2015 UTC,Sleeping in class especially in primary school can be a sign that the child is having problems at home. All the teachers described in these comments sound like major assholes.
PeopleBeingJerks,300ch1,Herak,9,Mon Mar 23 23:35:58 2015 UTC,"In elementary school and middle school this is an indicator, but when you get to high school and college falling asleep is usually due to work or partying."
PeopleBeingJerks,300ch1,Ontheneedles,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:55:53 2015 UTC,"My favorite professor would evacuate the room when someone fell asleep. If it wasn't close enough to the end of class to dismiss, we would continue class in the student lounge. Eventually a drowsy student would emerge looking quite embarrassed and he would just tell the student it looked like they like they needed a rest and proceed to continue class."

In this particular instance only: if she'd parked between the lines, that would still have left only half a parking space unoccupied by snow (unless there was someone overcome by OCD running around, hint hint), so she wasn't inconveniencing anyone by parking over the line.  The owner of the Miata actually went out of their way to inconvenience someone who was only being mildly annoying at worst.  Beyond that, I'd have to know whether the person driving the Miata had actually spoken with her about it before.  If he had never spoken about it with her, then that makes him a passive-aggressive douche.  No, I'm not asking.  No, I don't want to know.

Maybe the driver had a bad day at work or something but it was clear from his actions that he was trying to pick a fight. People like this have no business operating a ton of fast moving steel with bicycles around. Also, the comments on that video make me facepalm through my head."
PeopleBeingJerks,2xerwf,Firree,15,Sat Feb 28 01:00:21 2015 UTC,"It's mind boggling to me that people actually think that the cyclist was at fault.   Bikes have the same rights on the road as cars do. Just because you turn your blinker on, doesn't mean you have the right to change lanes at will.   Dude in the van is a total cunt, and should probably get a good talking to by the police."

If you've got some data/statistics to suggest otherwise then obviously I'll shift my stance but otherwise I think videos like this pretty much bastardize what is becoming a thankless profession on this sub.

PeopleBeingJerks,2x1khh,toogoneforthis,11,Wed Feb 25 08:28:01 2015 UTC,"Citizens arrest is still a thing (at least where I live). The problem is that the cop would claim that he was using reasonable force and just doing his job. It becomes complicated because police need to use force in certain situations, and exactly what is and isn't appropriate isn't always well defined. Trying to place a cop under citizens arrest in a situation like this would likely just result in you being arrested for obstructing the police officer (or whatever the actual law is about that).   Really the best thing is to record the event, and the badge number of the officer and lodge a formal complaint about it. It might not result in any action, but you won't end up being arrested or annoying an officer who is clearly not too shy about using force. At least in theory there should be some investigation into the event as a result of a complaint though."

Deliberate and precise, a real professional. See how the bad guy cowers in fear, while the brave police man shows mercy by not hitting him again. I hope the criminal on the ground gets attempted murder for his small movement. People need to realize how much danger that cop was in by even breathing the same air as a person like that. I hope that guy dies in prison alone. The world is better off without him. We need more people like that cop. Nothing makes me feel safer than a huge group of dudes in fast cars running around town shouting at people in their best angry dad voice. The anti-cop movement needs to go back where it came from. If you don't like police officers beating the hell out of you, then don't get anywhere near them. They have to beat a certain number of crooks per year or they don't get paid. It's also unhealthy to not beat people within an inch of their life frequently, especially for someone with such a high stress job. If anything this particular officer should be advised by his superiors to use more force. He let this scum bag off too easy. Had it been me in his shoes, he would have  been beaten with one of those huge flashlights until he was knocked out."

If an officer strikes a man down, he has done exactly what he was hired by the people to prevent.  Thus his authority is ended and he is pretty much fair game.   I'm an epileptic and had a seizure at a coffee shop and when I came to, I was in a cell, and covered in cuts and bruises.  I went there to meet my wife and woke up in a cell after being beaten up a cop who told his partner in front of witnesses he was going to teach that spaz a lesson.  I was beaten while unconscious and charged with assaulting an officer.  They only dropped the charges when a private video showed the cop laughing and kicking me while I was seizing.

Dude was trying to pull his arm away, which resulted in the cop pushing him to the ground. If you want to argue that pushing him to the ground contained the perceived ""threatening"" situation, sure.  Because a drunk elderly homeless guy who couldn't stand on his own two feet could've easily overpowered the officer who effortlessly pushed him down? Pretty sure there's a physics lesson in there.   he grabs the officers [sic] arm   And then the officer slapped him in the face. I'd definitely call that an unwarranted use of force. There was neither self-defence, nor the need to contain the situation there; the guy was already on the ground... because the cop pushed him down when he could barely stand, if you'll recall.

He was the only player banned from the NHL for life, as a result of his attack on a referee in 1927.   While a member of the Montreal Canadiens, Coutu was one of the players hospitalized during the cancelled (1918-1920 flu pandemic) 1919 Stanley Cup series, won the Stanley Cup in the 1923–24 NHL season, and was captain of the team in the 1925–26 NHL season. After his eviction from the NHL, Coutu played a total of four years in the Canadian-American Hockey League (C-AHL) and American Hockey Association (AHA), then coached the C-AHL's Providence Reds.

This robot will also cooperate a lot better since it's under the control of humans and doesn't have the ability or intelligence to make it's own decisions.  So, No. This doesn't belong here.

The last time I got snagged by one It took well over an hour and a half to do a full vehicle safety check. The officer returned with tickets for what amounts to ""Dirty wheels"".

Yes, he wanted YouTube hits, but he was demonstrating his knowledge of his rights to show viewers how most people don't know that and how cops try to get you to waive your rights on the assumption that you don't know them.  I'm not sure about the constitutionality of road blocks and DUI checkpoints. They seem to be prevalent in states for sure."

Most checkpoints are legal as long as they aren't delaying travel by too much or specifically targetting a certain person or group(i.e. posting up down the road from someone they suspect of dealing drugs in hopes of catching someone who will snitch on that person).  I think the cop did overreact just a hair but seriously only a little bit.  This group of people who think they know their rights when they don't is growing, and also connected to what Law Enforcement generally are thinking are the most dangerous threat right now which is Right-wing extremism, like sovereign citizens and militia survivalist types.

I'm not saying that he did it all right or wrong, but I can say that if I were in that situation, I would have felt threatened (which is what I think the officer was ultimately going for..) I think the simple fact that the car dude kept his cool and held his constitutional ground speaks worlds. Kudos, man."
PeopleBeingJerks,2v1zkd,coreyclement,7,Fri May 22 20:16:55 2015 UTC,"This guy is a complete tool. He was just being difficult from the very beginning for the sake of being difficult. Immediately asking if he's being detained. It's a routine checkpoint, he isn't the only one being pulled over, there's no reason to start acting like that other than thinking he looks cool on camera. Furthermore, he was a fucking idiot. The right to remain silent until your attorney is present pertains to your Miranda rights. The fifth amendment is the right against self incrimination and being held to answer without the presence of a grand jury. Miranda rights are after you're in custody to prevent violation of fifth amendment rights. There's nothing self incriminating about telling them that your address on your license is correct. Just don't be a fucking asshole, and maybe people won't be an asshole to you."
PeopleBeingJerks,2v1zkd,Rammusification,7,Sat Feb 7 03:21:55 2015 UTC,If I'm not mistaken if you plead the fifth the police have the right to detain you in order to hold you while determining the required information. I would have loved to have seen that here.

Close to the entrance, barrier on one side. Prime parking. Just one problem - Some stupid minivan is in the space beside it but WAY over the line, I can barely fit. Aand there's someone in the passenger seat (minivan is facing forward).  So what do I do? Take the spot anyway. I want that barrier. So I drive in, hit the barrier with my wheel (I could barely fit), reverse, drive in, hit the barrier, etc. etc. I finally squeeze into the spot and look the passenger dead in the face. I get out, and go inside. As I'm walking in I slow to a stop. Holy shit, they are going to smash the shit out of my car with their door. Who the hell cares about damaging their minivan? Probably not them.  I had about 15 minutes before my shift so I went back out and waited. The passenger didn't end up getting out and the driver was right in front of me as I went out to check so they left quickly. I honestly would have sat there.  So I got the spot.

In that situation you're looking to merge into traffic and not paying attention to someone trying to walk in front of your car because he can't wait half a second before walking across your lane.

I filled the cups hoping they would pick them up along the way and have a cup of water as well. Thus making it a hassle and a peace offering all in the same packaging.  Story: Despite having a meeting very early in the morning, I agreed to have a small get together with my roommates and some friends. I figured it would be great to have friends come over and have a few drinks. My roomies ended up getting blasted and invited the entire neighborhood. I decided to turn in at 3 and asked my roomies politely to ask people to leave in about an hour. I wanted them to have a good time since it was the weekend but it was getting incredibly late. Well needless to say, the party finally died down at about 6:30. I was 15 minutes late to my meeting because I overslept. I came home (and of course), they were still passed out. I thought this would be a fitting retribution. I was originally going to fill it with milk but in the end, these guys are my buddies. So I filled it with water hoping they would have to clean and hydrate."

I realize it's really not that bad, but as a little dude it's pretty traumatizing.  I imagine as an old person it's worse because there's literally nothing you can do to stop the person (which also makes it funnier).

They have the power to, fine or suspend players or coaches if a play is made and the ref doesnt call it. For example, diving. The committee can fine the player quite a bit of money. Or another example is a player is given a red card during the game that is seen as rather harsh, the committee can nullify that red card so the player does not miss the next game. The same can be said the other way around, if a player does something extremely violent (say kicking or punching another player), it is an automatic red and a suspension of the next game, but the committee can extend the suspension depending on how serious the infraction was"

InFlammen and your story has clearly exposed you as some one who has never ridden more than his uncles dirtbike and certainly never ridden a scoter through downtown bangkok at night.    you can clearly see she grabs the throttle from the guy but does not return it to the idle position and instead holds it at the revved position, mistake number one.   if you look closely the rear tire never stops spinning its possible the woman pulls the front break to help stop herself but never touches the rear one. the front break maneuver does successfully stop her, but she never releases the throttle and, she freaks out when the rear of the scooter start to spin out to the right... out and to the right,   she uses her foot to try to stop the scooter from moving, which almost works. until she probably lets off the front break a little and takes off. at this point she's half way off the scooter already and has no means of controlling it"

So if they had 2 million subs or more, and regular content they could be making upwards of 500 to 600 thousand a year. Is it worth it for that kind of money for you to take a punch every so often and be in dangerous situations? Soilders get shot at for 50k a year... So I guess yes?  They are jackasses and it pisses me off the amount of money they earn endangering others."

PeopleBeingJerks,2o7eiy,sqectre,-1,Thu Dec 4 19:41:34 2014 UTC,I wouldn't really back down on this one. First you were quite specific about not generalizing Norway by saying 'Not that all fights' so he's at least wrong when he says 'much' because clearly you take effort to avoid generalizing at times.  Secondly you are referring to an entire nation. Their is no way you can refer to attitudes of an entire nation without it inherently being a generalization to some extent so his comment is asinine for that point.  And now that you have listed your evidence from internet videos although it's possibly floored it clearly wasn't a baseless accusation.

If you're curious (I'll try to keep the translation as literal as possible, meaning some of the wording is going to sound a little Norwegian).   A million Americans have seen the NRK (Norwegian TV channel) comedian Amir get beaten by a bouncer. But the clip is really from an upcoming Norwegian movie  The video, caught with a handheld iPhone camera, shows a young man walking down Møllergata in Oslo with a bat in his hand.   He walks determinedly toward a bouncer sitting on a kerb and twirls the bat threateningly. The bouncer tells him to sod off, but when the assailant continues threatening, the bouncer gets up and punches him right in the face with a heavy punch.  The man with the bat lies knocked out on the street, spitting blood. Several people walk by without reacting until the police arrive.  What is success?  The video clip, which looks like the real deal, was posted on the popular but controversial website World Star Hip Hop the night before yesterday. In 24 hours over one million people have watched it.  What very few have known about the video is that it is directed by the award winning director Kristoffer Borgli, and is a part of the ambitious upcoming short film he is behind, called ""Internet Famous"".  The theme in the movie can be summed up as the question: ""What does it take to be successful"", Borgli told Filter.  The movie follows the character Amir, played by comedian and actor Amir Asgharnejad, known from NRK shows, who incites fights with strangers on the streets of Oslo while filming the whole thing.  His plan is to get famous by posting the videos online.   etc. etc."

Real bouncers are trained to never respond with violence unless there is a absolute need for it. There is no way they would engage anyone, regardless if they carry a baseball bat or act like assholes, you simply don't do unless a person becomes physical and turns into an actual threat to the safety of you and others. And even then the priority of a bouncer will be to calm a person down, relying on their rights for citizens arrest to restrain a troublemaker until the cops arrive. They don't start throwing punches just because someone gives them bullshit, or else they would be KO'ing half a dozen guys every night. That's not to mention that the risk of liability is far too great to get away with this, a bouncer is no different from any other citizen after all. Punching someone would still be considered assault and while self-defence carries some weight bouncers are usually not going to risk it."

I can definitely see how this faker's actions hurt him and cannot blame him for what he said.

Also fuck that, he clearly has some shoddy story all set up in his head to fly with if anyone calls him out. I honestly hope the Military gets involved in this and dispenses justice.

This horse is confused as fuck. Even a few horse trainers in the comments are completely disgusted and confused as to what they are doing. It's just dumb.  It's like when some people train their dogs not to poop by beating them and kicking them outside for pooping in the house while they were out. The dog has no idea that they were being yelled at for that, as far as the dog knows, you came home and beat it. It's just going to train it to be fearful of you when you come home."

The discussion revolved around the guy getting expelled for this, and I was saying that we can't even assume that he was suspended, much less expelled. At another school, a student actually stabbed another student and he wasn't expelled. Expulsion is extremely rare these days.   Regarding suspension, yes, this student was likely suspended for this. However, students are getting away with behaviors these days that would have gotten them suspended in the past. Suspensions may be going up, but misbehaviors are going up even faster, and what was once an expellable offense is now just suspendable, and some previously suspendable offenses are now detention, ""school beautification"" or other lesser* consequences.  .  * Note that in these days of sitting at home with the X-box while the parent(s) go to work, I'm not sure that we're necessarily doing the wrong thing by avoiding suspensions.)"

PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,PizzaWithKetchup,57,Fri Nov 14 17:08:40 2014 UTC,She should have called the cops if it was such a big deal.  You can't appoint yourself a police officer and confiscate property.  She got what she deserved for trying to take the law into her own hands.  Hilariously.
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,SlendersSuit,-57,Fri Nov 14 10:12:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah maybe she didn't do the best she could, but she asked nicely. When she confiscated the board she said they could call to get it back. Then the they took her to the floor.  She offered a very reasonable solution that wouldn't waste police time of they could stop being cunts for 5 minutes."
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,Skorpazoid,25,Fri Nov 14 13:09:57 2014 UTC,"But it wasn't reasonable. She stole their property. If she had left while they were still trespassing and called the cops, the skaters wouldn't know to leave, and would have spoken to the cops. It's rarely ok to just steal someone's property, this is not one of those times. Also, they didn't tackle her or anything. She tried to grab at the last kid running away, overextended her reach, and fell over as he ran."
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,Locusts,-31,Fri Nov 14 15:34:23 2014 UTC,"So by that logic shouldn't the skaters have contacted the police or lawyers to take back the board. The fact of the matter is in day to day interactions like this you can't do everything by the book. They broke the law, she tool reasonable steps to get them to stop. This was ignored and then the situation escalated.  by taking the board she went to far But even then she gave a perfectly easy way to get it back. by taking her to the ground they made the situation alot more severe.   They ignored the law, ignored reasonable steps to stop. Then they retrieves their property with violence.  She took the board which was used without permission on her property and was also actively damaging the property.  Frankly in taking immediate steps to.prevent her property damage id be curious to see if she even was acting illegally by confiscating it."
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,Skorpazoid,12,Fri Nov 14 15:51:45 2014 UTC,"Either way, she did not need to take the board, if she just left to call the police, make it look like they won, then they wouldn't be expecting the police or know to run. Either way, giving a ""perfectly easy way to get it back"" doesn't matter. What if you were filming a fight, then, after it ended, one of the participants came over, took the camera, and gave you a ""perfectly easy way"" to get it back because he didn't want evidence? giving a way to get back stolen property doesn't make stealing it ok.  I don't think they really used violence to get the board back, they just kinda took it from her. They didn't hit her or anything anywhere in that video. And they did not take her to the ground. She fell as a result of her own actions. She grabbed for the kid running away. Maybe she grabbed him, maybe she missed. Either way, she was off balance at the end, and gravity took over."
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,Locusts,-13,Fri Nov 14 15:57:40 2014 UTC,"But they didn't need to carry on acting illegally. They broke the law first and ignored reasonable steps to desist. So yeah, the woman wasn't maybe making the best decision taking the board (though as I said I'm not sure it was illegal as it was actively being used to damage the property) but they also clearly broke the law. So why is everyone saying the woman is a jerk?"
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,Skorpazoid,8,Fri Nov 14 16:13:39 2014 UTC,"Probably because, by the end of the video, the kids got the point, she wanted them gone. They were, at that point, ready to leave if they just got the board back. They were trying to come to a compromise and she was unrelenting. That's my guess."
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,Locusts,7,Fri Nov 14 17:15:40 2014 UTC,"They didn't necessarily break the law, maybe someone that lived there gave them permission to be there?

PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,Skorpazoid,6,Fri Nov 14 20:10:59 2014 UTC,"Theft of personal property is not justifiable in this situation. Neither is trespassing. Both parties were in the wrong. But she chose to intervene in the situation instead of letting the police handle it.   Edit: I thought of a good parallel. If your neighbor parks in your parking spot at an apartment complex you cannot break into his car and move it. You must go through the proper channels. You might think it'd be easier to take the situation into your own hands, but in doing so you are in the wrong as much as the original offender."
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,thebenson,2,Fri Nov 14 20:14:34 2014 UTC,"Well saying that's true. Were the skaters not equally wrong in getting their skateboard back by force rather then using the authorities themselves? She had said she would return it, they knew where she worked and it is reasonable to assume if they were in the right that they should have no real trouble getting it back.  And I appreciate the parallel, but it will be a matter of reason ultimately, and a car is much more expensive then a skateboard. I imagine if someone repeatedly despite warning, continued to park on your land you would be able to move the car, or clamp it (an equivalent of taking the skateboard).   Also, thanks for being the first person to actually engage rationally."
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,Skorpazoid,1 point,Fri Nov 14 20:25:42 2014 UTC,"The skaters were wrong yes. Generally, you can't use force to defend or retrieve property - your home being an exception in most cases. The skaters should not have used force to get the property back. This whole situation would make for a good hypothetical case for a torts class.  With regards to the parallel - you have to remember she does not own the land. She is acting on the behalf of the owner; a subtle distinction but an important one. And generally recourse for someone repeatedly parking on your property is a tow. After a car is towed the owner usually learns their lesson because towing and associated fees (storage, etc.) are expensive. But you couldn't say, take the wheels off the car so it can't move or push the car into a garage and lock the garage.  Though all the above depends on how a judge views a case. If it were a case of repeated trespass, where the property owner had repeatedly called the police out, etc. I believe the judge would more or less be on the side of the property owner."
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,thebenson,-1,Fri Nov 14 20:42:24 2014 UTC,"Well, ultimately I guess it would be lawyers to decide. But my argument has never been that she acted the best way possible. I just don't think she is a jerk.  She is just working her job and she started off being polite. It's clearly at least debatable to the legality of her actions and under the circumstances she deserves a bit of slack, it must be intimidating confronting 3 guys who clearly won't show you any respect.  To me the skaters were just real dicks, they were breaking the law and couldn't just move on. The woman may have acted correctly or incorrectly but she's no jerk."

But there was definitely room for improvement on all sides. I'm sure that had she asked nicely they would've left without any argument, but she got angry and they responded in kind, and it just escalated."

She asked them not to skateboard there and they did it anyways, then they get upset that she's gonna call the police and only then do they want to leave. You're not entitled to skateboard wherever the fuck you want just by virtue of being alive. There are plenty of skateboarders who do follow the rules and still get shit on, but fuck these guys"
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,micmea1,-5,Fri Nov 14 10:02:04 2014 UTC,It's beyond me how they anyone could rationalize the skateboarders action. Yes the woman shouldn't have taken action and instead call the police immediately but that doesn't make it any less of a jerk move on their part.
PeopleBeingJerks,2m9plz,DanMooreTheManWhore,3,Fri Nov 14 11:14:23 2014 UTC,She fucks up when she tries to take the board. It's bullshit and there's a pretty good chance the kid wouldn't have gotten it back. She has the right to kick them out. And if they don't leave call the cops.

The video tries to make her out to be the bad guy an she's not. In fact, in trying to avoid the consequences of there actions they had no problem physically injuring an older woman. It might not seem like it but any fall when you're in your 50s or 60s and so on can have lasting implications. She was a victim of the ILLEGAL actions of a group of teenagers who refuse to take responsibility and feel like rules don't apply to them.

PeopleBeingJerks,2lwnu7,rayrayww,-4,Wed Nov 12 04:42:35 2014 UTC,"Doubt that's true.  Most of these spots are found on private property.  My layman's understanding of the law says that means they can make up any rules they want. Probably wouldn't do anything about it in most cases. But businesses have the ""right to refuse service"" and can have you banished. If it escalated, they can charge you with trespassing.  So, I'd say it is enforceable by law."
PeopleBeingJerks,2lwnu7,AdamDe27,3,Sat Nov 15 01:21:57 2014 UTC,"Enforceable by law   You are not violating any statutes written by any form of Government, so a police officer has no grounds to issue a citation.   The business is well within it's rights to tow the vehicle off their property or ""trespass"" you from the property which has to go through a magistrate.  If the agreement is violated after that, then you can be arrested for trespassing.   Also keep in mind that the parking lot is usually not owned by the individual business, but by the holding company that leases the building to the business."

PeopleBeingJerks,2ltgxd,ilive2lift,1 point,Mon Nov 10 04:59:16 2014 UTC,"I assume you're talking about ""easement"".  An easement is simply the legal right to access or use land that is owned by someone else.    So, if I have a city easement on property I own (which will be specified in the property deed), the city has a legal right to access the portion of my property covered by the easement.  They can dig it up, permit utility companies to access it, or simply dump snow from the road onto it.   Most property in a city will have such easements so that the city can facilitate the maintenance of roads and utilities.  Where I live, a typical easement is 10ft. from the curb.  YMMV out in the country."

I think that's a good rule to follow. I do not control other people if they aren't following the same rule as I. For I'd be breaking the rule. You finish your business and you leave the lady and her kid behind without a word said. The only difference between my way and the lady in the videos way is that I didn't get punched in the face.

Children aren't a machine you can just switch off when it suits you. I'm sure the mother wanted the child to be quiet just as much as everyone else and was very likely already embarrassed.

PeopleBeingJerks,2lb2tx,DukeMaximum,5,Wed Nov 5 15:59:22 2014 UTC,"The best you could probably do is water. If it's a concentrated acid, putting concentrated base on your face to neutralize is a horrible idea. Strong bases are caustic and will cause further damage. Additionally, reaction between concentrated acid and base is usually violent... best solution is probs diluting as much of it as possible by flushing with copious amounts of water  Edit: also, if it's something so mild that baking soda can neutralize it, it shouldn't be able to do so much damage; baking soda has a pH of ~9  Edit 2: I was wrong about baking soda, see below. 3 years removed from college and it's showing already."

PeopleBeingJerks,2lb1u9,BringoutCHaDead,8,Wed Nov 5 19:55:51 2014 UTC,"I've heard this repeated and its kind of a misnomer. When people say this, there referring to M1. However, bath salts is a blanket term for any legal high. M1 (bk-MDMA) was at one time legal and sold as one variety (there are a million different varieties with greatly differing ingredients) of bath salts until it got scheduled and is no longer sold as such.  The M1 high feels so similar to molly (MDMA) that most users including myself cannot tell any real difference. Also, M1 costs about half of what real Molly costs (this becomes a very lucrative situation for dealers) Half he people I know actually prefer M1. So yeah, M1 was for a very short while sold legally by some manufacturers as bath salts but those days are long gone and bath salts nowadays are something completely different."

PeopleBeingJerks,2lb1u9,BertyLohan,2,Wed Nov 5 01:28:44 2014 UTC,"M1/Mcat are what's usually confused for Molly.  Meth is more expensive than MDMA, dealers would be shorting themselves if it was that way round."
PeopleBeingJerks,2lb1u9,BertyLohan,2,Wed Nov 5 05:40:47 2014 UTC,"Those are probably passed off for it as well, but I personally have received Molly that was half MDMA half meth, it does happen. I've also received mephadrone(sp? Bathsalts) shortly after it's ban. I don't know where you're from, but here in the western US, Molly is ten a pt., while a gram of meth is $20. So .1 of Molly would cost $10, and for $10 in meth you'd get .5, definitely cheaper. 5x cheaper."
PeopleBeingJerks,2lb1u9,BertyLohan,2,Wed Nov 5 07:13:37 2014 UTC,I find it almost impossible to believe that meth would be 5x cheaper than MDMA. A gram of meth being $20 straight up isn't right.  Mephedrone and m-cat are one and the same. Getting ripped off with bathsalts is pretty common. I've heard of dealers giving newbies meth instead of MDMA to get them hooked on something more expensive/addictive.

Such a fucked up thing to do though, tricking people in to doing drugs 10x worse for you just to make a quick buck. Another problem with prohibition, but I digress..   I'm not lying about the meth though, I can get both drugs for that price right now. I'm interested as to where you live where meth would be so much more expensive? I do know I'm in an area saturated with the stuff. I guess I've never thought about it before, meth is disgusting, but I've always known it as a cheap drug. Didn't expect it to cost too much more anywhere else due to it being so easy to manufacture."
PeopleBeingJerks,2lb1u9,combat-ninja,2,Wed Nov 5 08:11:38 2014 UTC,"I'm in the UK, I can get a gram of MDMA for about £30 at best. Meth would be something way more though, upwards of £60. I didn't realise there was such a huge fluctuation in Meth prices though, I guess it's loads cheaper in some parts of the states.  Weird. Meth's fucked up though so I'm not stressing the prices."
PeopleBeingJerks,2lb1u9,mwmwmwmwmmdw,2,Wed Nov 5 08:28:59 2014 UTC,"Damn that is insane, I have heard drugs are a whole lot more expensive in the U.K. though. We're just a whole lot closer to Mexico I guess lol.   It is strange meth is so much more expensive. Is pseudo ephedrine, or cough syrup, harder to get there? I could also just  see there not being as much of a demand.. But I have no evidence to back that up at all. I think I'm just stereotyping Brits to have a bit more class than smoking crystal meth lol.   Edit: Just noticed I misread how much you get Molly for, because 30€ for a gram is much cheaper than here, which is like $75. Unless you are confusing it a g for a .g. Although molly seems like it would be supplied as easily there as it is here and could also be in higher demand; cheaper."
PeopleBeingJerks,2lb1u9,Feelthenips,2,Wed Nov 5 09:37:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah it's pretty bonkers. The idea of a gram of meth for $20 seems absolutely insane to me.   I think the demand is probably true. Meth to me seems like more of a US drug. Ahaha I'm not sure it's about classiness, we tend to stick to Ket/MDMA/Coke I guess (although coke is definitely hard to get hold of/be sure of the purity of). I'm not actually sure how regulated/hard to get pseudo ephedrine is over here in comparison but there's less of a meth scene so I can't see it being too strict.   Ah it's £30 for a gram at the cheapest, which is about €40. Although buying MDMA at £30 means it's likely cut with stuff. £35-40 is a more normal buying price and you're more likely to be getting decent stuff and that's not too much less than the US."

PeopleBeingJerks,2kwpxw,autowikibot,2,Fri Oct 31 20:51:27 2014 UTC,"Handball:       Handball (also known as team handball, Olympic handball, European team handball, European handball, or Borden ball ) is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each (six outfield players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball to throw it into the goal of the other team. A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.  Modern handball is played on a court 40 by 20 meters (131 by 66 ft), with a goal in the center of each end. The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; the goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while ""jumping"" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball and Czech handball (which were more common in the past) and beach handball (also called sandball). The game is quite fast and includes body contact, as the defenders try to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. Goals are scored quite frequently; usually both teams score at least 20 goals each, and it is not uncommon for both teams to score more than 30 goals.  The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in northern Europe, chiefly in Scandinavia and Germany. The modern set of rules was published in 1917 in Germany, and had several revisions since. The first international games were played under these rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930. Men's handball was first played at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin as outdoors, and the next time at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich as indoors, and has been an Olympics sport since. Women's team handball was added at the 1976 Summer Olympics.

You know, the kind that uses the paper with perforated tabs on the side that it uses to pull the paper through. Everyone could give you a lot of reasons why they liked them - they have a certain charm to them, they like the sound, and they can do some neat tricks with the pixely output to make it look a lot higher quality than they're normally capable of. But they could just use a modern laserjet printer that will kick out ultra high DPI printed content at 10 times the speed, and they can do collating and have tons of other really awesome features. And it's not like it costs more to get the new one, prices are the same. The paper even costs a tiny fraction of what the special paper the dot matrix printers use. Plus it takes half the time to set them up and connect them. Sure, there are a couple computers out there that aren't compatible and the old ones ""just work"", but they just need to be updated to get with the times and they can take advantage of the better speeds and neat features too. If you were in a situation like this, you'd think everyone was crazy, that they should abandon their silly ancient crap and finally go kicking and screaming into the future.

Its obviously frustrating the piss out of him/her for whatever reason and assuming the law is as presented, you are in the wrong.  This just looks like somebody that is really frustrated by a violation of their rights.  I am assuming they really have tried multiple times to ask nicely and you have ignored him and come up with your own rule of 10 instead of 8, which maybe isn't true."
PeopleBeingJerks,2kpk9a,funkyold,-4,Wed Oct 29 22:42:32 2014 UTC,"I can understand your thoughts on the matter. We've all been annoyed by someone being loud and obnoxious. To clarify a little bit (sorry I didn't put this in the original text.) the last time my friend received a note was approx. 3 or 4 months ago (way before I began playing music with him) stating the law or his version of it being no amplified sound after 10..... So he cut it off at ten. We have no idea who this person is, if we did we would have totally talked and try to come to a reasonable compromise. That being said, the person delivering these notes left them on 7 different peoples cars in front of my friends house.

Obviously this is a frustrated individual, but you're not violating his/her rights; s/he's violating yours.   Also, if this person jumped the fence, then s/he's trespassing. If you feel threatened by this individual, feel free to call the cops.  They won't cite you if it's before 8 PM, but trespassing doesn't have a time limit."

Step 4: If you find you're not violating any laws that you personally looked up. Then keep on keeping on.  Step 5: If you are violating a law then look into either sound proofing the garage or playing in the basement instead.

There is room for debate on your point.  I'm not thrilled about sending our troops anywhere, but I think the return on investment (i.e. containment and eventual eradication) will beat expectations.  One major issue I have is that there is an element of racism that underlies sentiments like those expressed by the guy in the picture that goes completely unnoticed.

PeopleBeingJerks,2k59vf,GoldenGopher1,1 point,Fri Oct 24 09:48:06 2014 UTC,"Yeah I hear ya malaria is a major issue. What makes Ebola so frightening (especially to those in the West) is that humans are the vector for Ebola whereas insects are the vector for malaria, and insects roam far less than humans do. Yeah, it's a shady and selfish attitude if you value each and every human life equally (which you should), but this ain't a perfect world."

Ultimately, ebola doesn't really pose much of a threat outside of the developing world. The West is simply too clean, too advanced and too careful for ebola to spread the way it does in sub-Saharan Africa.   It's probably also worth pointing out that ebola has killed fewer people since 1975 than malaria kills children every week."

There was 2 cars parked on the street, not enough room in between to parallel in between them. (The other car left before I got close enough)  Instead of going ahead about 1/2 block and parking where there was room.... She yes ...decides to stick herself in there anyway. butt in the road and nose parked sort of. But she's also about 8 feet from the curb... Just wow.  She went in the house And didn't come out for about 10mins( was picking up someone up)  I was about 2 blocks away doing outdoor bootcamp( not stalking haha )   I seriously don't understand people 😳😒"

At least, that's for all of the red light systems I know of. They need a picture of your car behind the white intersection line with the light red, then one with it red and your vehicle inside the intersection (and one of the driver with the plate showing as well). If you enter on a green or yellow, and it turns red while you're in intersection, you can't get a ticket for running the red. You could get a ticket for blocking the intersection though.  It just occurred to me that by ""cross into"" you do mean enter, it just wasn't immediately clear to me."

Just a driver who obviously went through the red got stopped by the advance left turn green and got stuck in the middle of the intersection.   People went around the car, honking because it was obviously in the way, etc. And when the light finally turned red it tried to sneak back in to go. I was sitting there thinking, where's a police car when you needed one.  As soon as the regular green came back on, a police car turned on its lights and chased down the car.  Probably not the best day for the driver."

PeopleBeingJerks,2ioe2k,mathurin1911,1 point,Mon Nov 17 12:41:15 2014 UTC,"Jacques Lacan expanded Freud's idea of the phallus to make it a little more applicable. Most intelligent references to phallic symbols are citing his perspective.  The Lacanian ""phallus"" is some sense of power/freedom that is lost when an infant learns a language, and is forced from that point on to filter his nameless needs and urges through the vocabulary available to him.  It's not the physical penis, though the penis often does symbolize the phallus to many people. He outlines different reactions to the presence of the penis/phallus, giving us gender roles -- which, it should be noted, can be filled by people of either biological sex.  They're interesting ideas, not science. None of these things can really be proven, of course, but why would you want to? The fun comes from thinking about them."

PeopleBeingJerks,2i8vcr,UnstableParallel,66,Sat Oct 4 02:35:13 2014 UTC,"I used to create messes like this in my college dining hall, too - dumping my drink on my tray, hiding silverware beneath piles of trash, dropping my tray on the conveyor diagonally so it was guaranteed to jam up the line, etc....  I saw it as a consequence-free way to vent my frustration over shitty food and a faceless 'other' who, in my mind, treated us like cattle.  Plus, it was a harmless act of rebellion - what better way to show my buddies that I didn't play by the rules?  The day I stopped was the day I randomly made a friend who happened to work in the dining hall, cleaning up after others to pay the bills.  Suddenly, my 'rebellious' acts of disruption weren't harmless pranks. They were deliberate choices that made someone's job shittier, for no good reason.  I wasn't 'getting back at the man' by dumping my drink on the ground, or bending my silverware hopelessly out of shape - I was choosing to make another person's day that much worse.  One of the major lessons that you learn as you grow into adulthood is that being a member of society is never consequence-free.  As a child, you're taught to do the right thing, by getting caught and punished when you don't.  However, you're only an adult when you do the right thing because it's right - not because you'll get in trouble if you don't.    Children do the right thing because they don't want to be punished; adults do the right thing because it's the right thing to do. Leaving messes like this is fundamentally childish - only done because nobody will punish you."

PeopleBeingJerks,2hrx1y,redwormcharlie,1 point,Mon Sep 29 17:43:27 2014 UTC,"Because it seems like you are defending the lunatic. Sure, maybe Ken made a driving mistake (we can't possibly be sure) that made the lunatic guy upset. But as soon as the lunatic guy starts doing things far worse than whatever Ken's driving mistake could have been he becomes the criminal and Ken becomes the victim. If someone cuts you off in traffic you do not have the right to start putting people's lives in danger. I don't want to say your comment was ""stupid"" but it definitely was poorly written and if you had a logical argument it was definitely lost somewhere between your brain and the keyboard."

PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,kaigenji,1 point,Mon Sep 29 22:17:04 2014 UTC,Who the fuck is saying it's justified? Just because some guy got scissors in his arms for harassing/bullying another person doesn't make it ok to still harass other people. It's a totally separate issue that is unrelated.

Have you thought about the possibility of this being a frequent problem for the guy? Again, it isn't acceptable, no one said it was. However, those guys obviously pushed that guy to do something that crazy. Both parties are idiots, don't assuming one side was perfectly ok when you have no info on how this all happened."

PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,TheRealKidkudi,1 point,Mon Sep 29 03:29:47 2014 UTC,And it seems to me like he's a pretty shitty roommate too if he throws scissors into people.
PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,Tobaknowss,23,Mon Sep 29 13:57:43 2014 UTC,Try being bullied endlessly and then see which straw breaks your back.
PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,TheRealKidkudi,10,Mon Sep 29 17:53:07 2014 UTC,"How do you know he was being bullied endlessly from one clip? And even if he was, I can empathize but I still don't think it's justified to impale someone with scissors. That's a shitty thing to do, regardless of the situation."
PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,Gamiac,23,Mon Sep 29 18:26:37 2014 UTC,"It seems fairly obvious to infer from the facts that:   A. The clip was being recorded, likely to put onto Youtube. They probably expected to make a funny video, thus it follows that they've done it before. Otherwise, they would have no reason to expect something funny to happen.  B: The kid immediately resorted to violence. We can infer from this that he has tried to reason with them before, and it obviously didn't work. Otherwise we wouldn't expect someone to instantly resort to violence.  C: He reacted by grabbing the first thing he could get his hands on. This signals a more emotional reaction than a purely logical one, unless you assume that the attack was premeditated. We wouldn't expect such a strong emotional reaction from someone over being harrassed if they weren't already being constantly harrassed beforehand.   I am honestly reminded of those stories where people at zoos think that climbing into the lion's den and teasing them is a great idea, only to find great surprise when they get horribly murdered. The difference is that in this case, people seem to dismiss the lion as ""CrAzY!!1"" instead of wondering if, maybe, the person's actions led to the lion's reaction."

PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,TheRealKidkudi,-1,Wed Feb 4 10:26:06 2015 UTC,"as someone who's been bullied, you don't randomly pick up scissors for being sprayed while playing a game.  i seriously think that they knew that their shitty room mate would freak out over a small thing and they wanted to get back at him for being an asshole."
PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,Tobaknowss,6,Sat Nov 29 03:45:49 2014 UTC,"No, I'm saying both people here were assholes. You keep jumping to conclusions, both about me and about the people in the video, but it seems an awful lot like projection to me.  Was it a douche move to spray a kid who's in the middle of doing something he obviously enjoys and takes seriously? Yes, definitely. Does that make it any less shitty of the kid to throwing scissors deep into his roommates arm? No, not at all. I can't believe anyone would say ""yeah, fuck that kid for spraying him! He deserves to be impaled by scissors!"" That's ridiculous. Even if I were an ""eye for an eye"" kind of person, that's nowhere near a proportionate response. Barring immediate danger to the life of you or someone around you, impaling someone is not an okay thing to do."
PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,danielvutran,-1,Mon Sep 29 18:51:30 2014 UTC,"I'm not projecting I'm coming to conclusions based on previous experience, bullying behavioural studies, and just general common sense.  These conclusions are based on being bullied for the majority of my life and being almost 100% certain this wasn't an isolated incident.  Maybe if Mr. Febreze hadn't decided to be a dick in the first place I'd actually have some sympathy for him.  I will admit throwing the scissors probably wasn't the best move - but do you really think the guy would have stopped if asked nicely? No, no he wouldn't.  He wanted to be the big man in front of all his friends.  So yes it does make it less shitty of the kid who threw the scissors.  He was frustrated with being bullied and his emotions boiled over.  If he wasn't being bullied he would have no reason to throw the scissors in the first place.  Bullying someone for any reason is not an okay thing to do and if you do expect that one day they might rise up and throw a pair of scissors at your dumb ass."

PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,Neurexin,-2,Mon Sep 29 19:44:00 2014 UTC,It is 100% the guy who threw the scissors fault.  If you cant understand that you are autistic.
PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,BonerCityAmerica,3,Mon Sep 29 20:25:54 2014 UTC,"And you're an ignorant piece of scum for using autism as an insult.  Also, I think most people agree both parties were behaving shitty and therefore it was not 100% the scissor-throwing guy's fault. The gamer was retaliating upon deliberate provocation. Granted, no one deserved to get scissors stuck in them, and the guy who threw the scissors deserves most of the blame for this ER visit, but we don't know the backstory. It doesn't look like the gamer intended to do real harm (i.e., he was being careless, not deliberate), the guy going to the ER was being deliberately obnoxious, and it doesn't seem that this was a retaliation after a single isolated event."
PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,Neurexin,-4,Mon Sep 29 19:50:50 2014 UTC,"I'm not using it as an insult, I'm literally saying you don't understand social cues if you think that this is in any way justifiable. Spraying water on someone is a harmless fucking prank. Maybe a little annoying, but you will not find a single person in real life who thinks tht kid didn't overreact on the highest level"
PeopleBeingJerks,2hpsc5,stitches31,1 point,Mon Sep 29 20:29:09 2014 UTC,"By your logic, half this thread is autistic, even though autism is a much more complex and diverse condition than simply ""not understanding social cues"" (btw who made your criteria of social cue reading more valid than the diagnostic criteria used by medical professionals?). Autism is not correlated with thinking it's appropriate to throw sharp objects in response to being sprayed by some water -- that is a myth and a stereotype. And yes, you were using it in a derogatory way. Back pedalling because someone calls you out on it doesn't erase your bigotry it just makes you look like an even bigger ass than your original comment suggested.  I'll re-iterate since, oddly enough, you don't seem so good at reading social cues yourself: we don't know the whole backstory or how many times the person politely asked the others to stop, only to see his boundaries repeatedly violated. No one is condoning throwing scissors, but placing the blame squarely on the one guy, especially since this looks like this wasn't premeditated, intentional, or planned, is pretty obviously wrong as well."

If you're that terrified of something as commonplace as parking the car normally, then (by your own standards) it's far more illogical to take it out on the road in the first place. Who's to say those spaces won't be needed in the near future? I see a fucking handicapped sign right behind him. Last I checked, they didn't put handicap spaces at the ass-end of the lot.   What if more people riding Rolls' arrive and decide to do the same thing?   Who are you to say who gets to park like this and who doesn't? Just because my car didn't cost as much I should risk letting it get beat up? Less money = abuse?   If anything it's a greater concern to those with less money to spend on cars.....the cost of repairing a dent likely reflects a greater portion of their income, not to mention someone on a tighter budget has more at stake with resale value.

The danger is there and I would take care of my stuff, especially if it meant a lot to me; if I was guaranteed a safe spot, I'd park there, but at-least here in Canada, you're never safe from these drivers (won't specify races cough cough Indians).  Like I said, I can really tell you are not someone who cares about there car all that much or maybe your possession's in general but if I had a Rolls, I'd double park.  You are in no position to judge what someone's income/spend ratio is, so you haven't a clue what this person has to spend on repairs.

I feel pretty comfortable judging someone who spends more on a car than most people spend on a house, then acts like a ding would be their downfall. And I actually am in a position to judge. Everyone gets to judge everyone for whatever they want. We all judge everything around us all the time. What we DON'T get to do is let that judgement translate to special treatment or privileges. Our subjective opinions do not put us or others above the rules. I'm holding everyone to the same standards. You are the one trying to make special exceptions.

Right as we were leaving, another family sat down at one of the tables and we darted right out of the mall.  Hopefully nobody needed the salt and one of the employees figured it out and fixed it right away.

When they are associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), and sometimes attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the thoughts may become paralyzing, anxiety-provoking, or persistent. Intrusive thoughts may also be associated with episodic memory, unwanted worries or memories from OCD,  posttraumatic stress disorder, other anxiety disorders, eating disorders, or psychosis.  Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, and they can be divided into three categories: ""inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, or blasphemous religious thoughts"".

It seems like you aren't from the US so perhaps you need a history lesson on why exactly black people are in the predicament they are in. Hundreds of years of being treated like property, then another 100 or so of legally being excluded from jobs, education, fair housing, voting etc.  My own father in his 50s still was still experiencing the remnants of jim crow society as a young man.   I just wish for once people like you could know what it feels like to grow up, have no criminal record, go to college and get a degree, pay your taxes like a good citizen...then have some one call you a nigger or an animal without knowing the first thing about you.

Also like you said those chairs are pretty heavy so even if he did it on purpose there was no reason he should used enough force to push the whole chair over because that's just ridiculously excessive."
PeopleBeingJerks,2az8zu,lonelylunar,6,Sat Aug 2 23:16:02 2014 UTC,"I think if you've been riding around in one of those chairs for more than a week, you have a decent sense of where those wheels are even if you're not all there in the head.  Cop was all the way back against the wall.  It's not normal to choose to steer within one foot of a large obstacle when there's another obstacle in front of you on that side and four feet of clear space on the other.  Someone not intending to run over the officer and not assuming he'd get away with it because of the handicap would have stopped and asked to get by."
PeopleBeingJerks,2az8zu,squirrelpotpie,-3,Thu Jul 17 23:56:17 2014 UTC,"Are you or have you been confined to a chair for long periods of time like a motorized chair or wheelchair or anything? I have and even after being in it for quite a while you still encounter problems. For instance he could've not seen the cop and tried to move at the last minute, he could've been hugging the wall and not realizing it, it actually is pretty normal to steer within a foot of obstacles due to being in the chair and depth perception is off, and as for the four feet of space he could've just not thought about it or could've avoided it due to the fear of falling off the curb or something but the cop had legs that seemed to work pretty well so it was a major dick move to just stand there and not move to let him through.   As for the second part you can't assume any of those things because you don't know what's wrong with the guy like his physical, mental, & social condition. For instance there's the possibility the guy is mute and couldn't ask, could've been too shy/scared to ask due to social issues. There's just too many variants or unknowns to be sure about anything related to this.  But just out of curiosity, why do people automatically jump to the conclusion that handicap people do things on purpose just because they think they'll get away with it?"

PeopleBeingJerks,2aw0u0,lust_the_dust,-13,Thu Jul 17 05:42:50 2014 UTC,There is not one scholarly paper verifying dolphin rape. Also it would be forced copulation.
PeopleBeingJerks,2aw0u0,SilverTongie,4,Thu Jul 17 00:41:32 2014 UTC,"Forced copulation = forced intercourse = rape. Pretending they are different is one of the dumbest things I've ever read. I'm stunned if you're serious. You're acting like a child correcting someone's grammar. It's only because rape is legally defined to humans, but the exact same requirements and actions for rape to be defined happens among dolphins, primates and other animals. That's the only reason you can't ""find a scholarly article on it."" It's because rape is for humans, but okay. Have it your way. Dolphins have forced copulation with females. There. Literally the same thing.  If you don't want to call males forcibly corralling females into an area and then aggressively having sex with them rape, then you will never learn.  Even on this page that is called ""The dolphin rape myth"" it is only a myth because he has a problem with the term rape. http://justingregg.com/the-dolphin-rape-myth/  He even says below that males herd females and have use infanticide to make females mate with them. Sounds pretty rapey to me.

PeopleBeingJerks,2an5kb,rellim1214,72,Mon Jul 14 05:48:41 2014 UTC,Thats probably because the Arsenal fans booed him every time he touched the ball and sung racist chants.. Why should he respect them if they didn't respect him
PeopleBeingJerks,2an5kb,badatfifa,-50,Mon Jul 14 15:18:05 2014 UTC,"Because he's getting paid millions and is a role model to thousands,  where as the average attendee is looked up to by few people in most cases.   Arsenal fans didn't disrespect him when he played for us,  we also didn't disrespect him to a HUGE extent after he left us.  It started when he started mouthing off about us and our team to media outlets,  Twitter week in and week out.   For a comparison,  would it be acceptable for Barack Obama to call people who are racists against him crackers?  Would he be justified in doing so?"

I'm setting a bad example by informing people who have the glass half full why this happened and what this is from a fans perspective?   People on here can be so dense,  if they hear anything other than the juicy story or piece of drama they want to believe happened they start throwing fits.   Give me sources,  interviews,  proving your points of view,  proving bananas were thrown,  proving that Adebayor is an absolutely an angel who did nothing wrong to be hated by these fans.    Many conclusions have been made from a GIF with no sound.  No sound yet somehow people know racist chants were made,  no first hand source or confirmation that those are indeed (very oddly) shaped bananas,  yet it's become the story.   No background and yet people are painting their own pictures.    4 years later after this even happened ,  and yet somehow these people on reddit know more about what happened from a GIF than the people who were there,  Man City,  Adebayor,  Arsenal,  the security guards there and the stewards."

Well, for one after he had one good season with us he was agitating for a move almost instantly. Flirting with Milan, Barcelona, etc. When a move failed to materialize, he was left with a lot to prove. He succeeded in winning back the fans, but then City came in with their large pay raise. He left for the pay raise, rather than remaining loyal to the club that put him on the map. This made him unpopular with the fans instantly. Picking fights with fans on Twitter and bad mouthing the club and manager afterwards to the media didn't help his case.   A chant started by Tottenham, and used against him when he used to play for Arsenal?"

PeopleBeingJerks,29hfg5,jmsh44,4,Mon Jun 30 20:20:14 2014 UTC,"Most people are joking, but there's a negative correlation between number of children and IQ. I'm too lazy to dig up my textbook from storage to get the source on that. It's not that having more kids makes people dumb. It's more like ""dumb"" people will forgo protection, or continue having kids beyond their means. ""Smart"" people quit while they're ahead, so to speak, and take precautions to not have kids if they're not ready.  Of course it's not a perfect 1:1 correlation, and having 10 kids doesn't mean you're dumb. It's just something that comes up when you look at populations as a whole."

PeopleBeingJerks,29hfg5,downvotesyndromekid,0,Mon Jun 30 21:19:56 2014 UTC,Well I'm guessing it's simple math.  If you have 2 parents and 2 kids you have a ratio of 1:1 parent to kid.  When you have 10 kids and two parents you have a ratio of 1:5 parents to kids.    Therefore if you take whatever parenting time you have and multiply it by the ratio it becomes clear that each child receives significantly less parenting as more kids are born into the household.    I'm betting if you look at amount of time spent directly parenting vs how kids do in life you will see a correlation between more time and a better outcome.   //half kidding

Their parents are probably better at parenting the second time round  A lot of activities can be done to multiple children equally efficiently, e.g. telling a story  And older children can look after and educate younger children"
PeopleBeingJerks,29hfg5,CaveGiant,1 point,Tue Jul 1 03:51:12 2014 UTC,"I agree,  but it's just less likely the quality stays the same. The only reason people had tons of kids was because only a few could reasonably be expected to live through everything.  Now that it's pretty much expected to live through to a final older age I don't see the point in people having anymore than 2-3."

If someone tried to fuck up my car like that pretty sure my first reaction would be to put the person on their ass with the bike on top so there's time to make sure they can't do anything else before leaving

I drive to the right side to turn, when I see that it's blocking the white car from entering. I thought ""Ok, maybe they swung too wide and didn't have enough space to turn"". So I back up and motion them to go ahead of me. NOPE.  The SUV stayed there. After honking at them for a few seconds, I got out of the car to see what the heck was going on. I see a few people in the car, and head to the driver's side. The white car rolled down their windows and said ""Why are they doing this?"" ""What's wrong with them?"" I get close enough to see. The driver was talking to the passenger then looked at me with an angry face. I motioned and said ""You're blocking these people! MOVE!""...The driver folded their arms and pouted angrily. So I did what any sane person would do. I pulled out my camera (phone).  I took a picture of the driver, then I stepped back and took a picture of the scene. The white car passenger said ""Yeah! Thank you!"" I went back to my car and motion the other cars to stay back. I turned right and the white car turned in the right lane. The SUV then decided it was time to move. WTF."

It's not normal to get this upset over somebody having rims on their vehicle. People like to customize their vehicles, and some people like rims. What makes your vehicle so much better?  And they aren't acting like their vehicle is the coolest thing since ""sliced bread"". Are they taking up multiple parking spots? Yes. Do we know for a fact they do this everyday? No. We have the word of some stranger that could be lying for internet points. For all we know this is outside a hospital and the person's wife was going into labor.  Or maybe it is outside a corporate office and they DO park like that everyday. The parking lot is not at capacity, so nobody's life is being negatively affected. So how are they are a jerk? Usually to be a jerk you would need to be negatively affecting people.  I'd say deciding that a person is a douche and jerk just because they have rims on their vehicle and parked badly one time that we know about is pretentious and douchy."

I'm not an asshole and if the manager of the store or the cashier calls me over because that cashier is not busy I will go over there. You don't need to explain anything to me and I certainly wouldn't listen to it anyway with the way you attempt to communicate it using poor grammar and a potty mouth (fingers in this case since you're typing but I imagine you're just the same in real life too) anyway. Mr. (or Mrs) Youyou. Why are you going into a grocery store to buy a lighter anyway? It's so much easier to buy one in a smaller store that also sells your cigarettes. You're an unnecessarily very angry person. You really shouldn't be getting so worked up over this. Go smoke a cigarette and calm down.

My point was how do we know that that lady wasn't called over to the express lane by that cashier? You go to Walmart around where I live and they usually only have two or three people working the regular lanes for the whole store and quite often there are huge lineups so the manager or the express cashiers themselves will call people over to them. They even announce it over the loudspeaker. Are those people all ""assholes"" too? Would it be justifiable to post all their pictures here because of that?   ""we always find you assholes when we post this shit"" WOW good job! What will you do with that information? If that makes you feel good then it either doesn't take much to do so or you really don't have anything else to live for.

PeopleBeingJerks,27u4xx,autowikibot,2,Wed Jun 11 07:41:15 2014 UTC,"Weasel word:       A weasel word (also, anonymous authority) is an informal term  for words and phrases aimed at creating an impression that a specific and/or meaningful statement has been made, when in fact only a vague or ambiguous claim has been communicated, enabling the specific meaning to be denied if the statement is challenged. A more formal term is equivocation.  The use of weasel words to avoid making an outright assertion is a synonym to tergiversate.  Weasel words can imply meaning far beyond the claim actually being made.  Some weasel words may also have the effect of softening the force of a potentially loaded or otherwise controversial statement through some form of understatement, for example using detensifiers such as ""somewhat"" or ""in most respects"".   Weasel words are likely to be used in advertising and in political statements, where encouraging the audience to develop a misleading impression of what was said can lead to advantages, at least in the short term (in the longer term, systematic deception is likely to be identified, with a loss of trust in the speaker).

PeopleBeingJerks,27l9ej,TypicalRunOfTheMill,10,Sun Jun 8 04:59:45 2014 UTC,"The automatic doors of the Ft. Lauderdale Target open.  An old woman comes out, pushing her cart.  There's only two small, plastic bags, but she still needs the help of a cart, because it also holds her cane, a recent necessity.  She stops at the curb, adjusts the contents of her cart, and shifts her over-the-shoulder cloth bag she uses as a purse closer to her body to brace for the jarring impact of the cart riding down the lip of the concrete curb.  She can't see as well anymore.  The sounds she hears when she's outside aren't the same sounds when she was young.  Loud, bass-driven music is playing loudly from a car that seems to be coming closer.  She grips the bar of the cart tightly as she looks both ways.  It's the lump in her throat that she's thinking about though.  A side effect of thinking about her husband, who used to help her carry the bags.  She had to sell her home after he died and move into a community center with other retirees.  Mostly widows and widowers too.  She swallows the lump, and thinks about happy days long gone.  She's lost in the face she saw herself grow old with.  Her memories float from year to year as she hazily pushes the cart towards the lot.  A loud honk awakens her from her reminiscent daydream.  She had leaned too far into the lanes where the cars travel.  An old habit from leaning into her husband when they used to walk together, side by side.  She makes it to her car and sees a note.  She's heard of ""Facebook"", but doesn't really understand it.  She does know the word dumb, however.  She looks and realizes that her car was not in the actual space.  She thought she was parking in tandem with the other cars on the right, but couldn't see the lines on the ground.  This world is not hers anymore.  Her senses are dulled.  Her partner for 54 years had left her.  She secretly always wished she had been the first to go.  He could have handled a note on his car with the words ""dumb ass"" on it.  She drops the note to flutter on the ground, clutches her cloth purse to find her keys, starts up her car and holds her breath, expecting to hear people laughing at her as she drives away, refusing to let them see her cry.  The cart still has the two, small plastic bags in it as she drives off the lot.  ""I should've been first."" she thinks, ashamedly.    53 likes.  201 shares."

Let's teach them that the one person who is their sole provider and care giver can act in violence towards them. I have a daughter whom has never been spanked. And you want to know something? It's amazing what happens when you talk to them like an adult, discipline them through time-out and temporarily taking her toys away. She is well behaved and respectful. Amazing. You should do some research into spanking. It is ineffective and only makes the parent feel like they have control."

I hear people say that using force as discipline can psychologically damage a child for life and traumatize them and all that... and then I think of myself being spanked... it seems silly.  Honestly, taking away my Gameboy or not letting me play outside for days at a time probably would have bothered me more.  A quick smack and a ""smarten up"" vs. being constantly reminded for days about whatever I did wrong.  I wasn't exactly a problem child, so spanks were far and few between, but nonetheless..."

So I figured if the fireball only touched me for a moment then it wouldn't burn me and it would look cool? VERY WRONG, my entire hand was burnt badly, I had one huge blister covering the back of my hand.   I only let the fireball touch me for about half a second too. That kid got some serious burns."
PeopleBeingJerks,26ar4f,KittyCLawe,3,Fri May 23 15:25:25 2014 UTC,That must be because a regular flame doesn't have such intense chemical to keep it on where are the fireball does.
PeopleBeingJerks,26ar4f,wehnerdy,2,Fri May 23 17:45:07 2014 UTC,The theory that short enough time exposed= reduced damage is true. What probably happened to you is it adhered to you and followed your hand as it cut through the vapor.   Hence why people can jump through hoops of fire and walk over coals.
PeopleBeingJerks,26ar4f,santacruzer7,3,Fri May 23 20:27:09 2014 UTC,"I'm thinking it's more likely that it's causing a flash burn, flash burns can occur in under .01 seconds at temperatures of 1500C. Axe uses Butane as the main propellant, and butane can burn around 1400C with the right butane to air mixture. So the fireballs that you produce with an axe can and a lighter are definitely hot enough to cause flash burns with a full second exposure.   I actually used burn cream and made sure to wash my hands for at least half an hour after the experience. So there shouldn't of been any problem with sticking to skin."

I lived in the swamp in Louisiana and I saw a twelve-year-old kid dive off the muddy shore and try and catch an eight foot alligator who was one of a group. I about shit, the alligators bailed.  Do not fuck with mother alligators in the spring when they have babies though. My friend Nick got too close and the mother initially swam away but then pivoted and as Nick said, ""ran across the top of the water"".   Weird thing is mother's will only protect offspring for a certain time period. They are especially protective against male alligators. There was a twelve footer that lived in the adjacent pond. We went back a month or so later.  Alligators are really hard to tell from their environment. It took about a minute but we saw her and the juvenile alligators right there ten feet away. Nick said ""Wanna see her chase me?"". Standing well behind him I said yes.   He got closer and closer and she just turned and disappeared under the water.  edit; spelling"

They should be ticketed for wasting police and public service resources and time. Because while three or four officers are here talking to this moron who's hiding behind a camera, someone might be getting their handbag stolen or might need medical attention. Completely ridiculous.

If things do ever devolve into a situation where the government is going to turn on it's citizens it's this guy and guys like him that the government is going to black bag and disappear first.

This child becomes out of control and a problem kid, and a teacher perpetuates it. If this kid is a problem, well the system needs to help the mother get this child the proper help he needs for his behavior. people who support the teacher clearly never have been at the hands of teachers who are disgusting bullies just as this woman is. I have seen kids get beat, and slammed and treated bad by teachers because they are considered ""bad kids"" and because of their jaded attitude towards ""blubbering cry baby parents."" I have been one of those kids, and you know what? Enough abuse from adults and you begin to not respect them and think everyone is out to hurt you, because of these pieces of shit like the woman in this video.

PeopleBeingJerks,25n7sw,Sarlax,8,Thu May 29 20:39:53 2014 UTC,"Where I live, you're automatically at fault if you rear end someone, regardless of circumstances. A friend of mine got burned by that when he was rear-ended at a red light, which forced his car to lurch forward and hit the car in front of his. The guy who caused the accident was liable for the damage to my friend's car, but my friend ended up being liable for the damage to the car in front. Fucking stupid.   So, I dunno what the laws are like wherever this was filmed, but it was almost certainly an attempt at insurance fraud. The really sad part is that it might be successful, even with the roadcam footage."
PeopleBeingJerks,25n7sw,xilog,4,Thu May 15 18:43:56 2014 UTC,"The ""protagonist"" here (the guy with the camera) was definitely driving unsafely. He's way too close to the car in front of him.   A good rule of thumb is that you should have at least three seconds worth of distance between yourself and the car in front of you if you're traveling at the same speed (like the two cars in the left lane going the same direction). From the beginning of the video to the 4 second mark, the forward car crosses 10 dashes (which the protagonist also crosses). That means the protagonist had less than a half-second of distance between himself and the forward car.  The first two cars come to a complete stop and then hold for about 1.5 seconds before the third car hits, and you can hear its breaks squeal about a half second before it hits, so it was also either 1) following too closely when this all started, or 2) wasn't paying attention to the road when this happened.  Either way, we have three idiots in a row."
PeopleBeingJerks,25n7sw,Sarlax,2,Sat May 17 09:46:51 2014 UTC,"Time rules are good, since they work at any speed, but the correct rule is two seconds.  Not three.  Source: am a trained advanced driver."

PeopleBeingJerks,25n7sw,skinner84,2,Sat May 24 20:28:36 2014 UTC,"Indeed; however it doesn't change the fact that the widely accepted rule at present is two seconds.

PeopleBeingJerks,25n7sw,autowikibot,1 point,Sun May 25 08:35:05 2014 UTC,The two second rule is good except the fact that 8 cars will try to pile in that space to cut two seconds off their drive time. That's how the traffic backs up when I go to work because people are assholes and they try to cut in when they shouldn't be.
PeopleBeingJerks,25n7sw,Borr,0,Mon Sep 29 22:48:56 2014 UTC,"Two-second rule:       The two-second rule is a rule of thumb by which a driver may maintain a safe following distance at any speed.   The rule is that a driver should ideally stay at least two seconds behind any vehicle that is directly in front of the driver's vehicle. It is intended for automobiles, although its general principle applies to other types of vehicles.  The two-second rule is useful as it can be applied to any speed. It is equivalent to one vehicle-length for every 8 km/h (5 mph) of the current speed, but drivers can find it difficult to estimate the correct distance from the car in front, let alone to remember the stopping distances that are required for a given speed, or to compute the linear equation on the fly. The two-second rule gets around these problems, and provides a simple and common-sense way of improving road safety.  The practice has been shown to dramatically reduce risk of collision, and also the severity of an accident should an accident occur. It also helps to avoid tailgating and road rage for all drivers.    Image i - The two-second rule is a way for the defensive driver to judge the minimum safe following distance to help avoid collisions under ideal driving conditions. The red car's driver picks a tree to judge a two-second safety buffer.

At least once a week, someone pulls in front of our building and block the loading dock and or parking lot. My parking lot is open along a road, it's clearly a lot, with a docking bay. My building is across the street from a body shop, and most people who pull into the loading zone are waiting for someone to drop off and they are there to pick them up. The have plenty of room, at most times, to pull into the parking lot of the body shop, or pull ten feet forward and park along the curb. You would think it would be no big deal for me to walk outside and kindly ask the people to move, but it is never met with a friendly smile. They get mad, they curse, they make the most infuriating excuse "" I'm just here for a minute picking such-and-such up"" as if that makes it cool. I have to kindly point out the open parking lot, the curb side parking and how they are blocking any truck from delivering to my dock and keeping potential customers from getting in to park. Often after I point out where they should be, and how they are blocking my shit, they look at me as if I am the asshole. I can't be nice enough to these people, cause I don't want some rage filled asshole shooting me.  This is why we can't grow up, because inconsiderate people are pure assholes from the get go. They have not the common courtesy already engrained in them, what makes you think civility for recourse is another trait they would possess?"

PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,Azonata,487,Wed Apr 30 20:05:36 2014 UTC,"Not my comment, credit due to whose it is:  ""Before this lady is crucified here in the ""court of Reddit opinion,"" let's consider all sides. Playing devil's advocate, put yourself in her shoes. You're driving home one evening on a dark road. You're sober, you're paying attention to the road, you're not texting or even adjusting the radio. You might have edged a bit above the speed limit hurrying home, but doesn't everyone? The road is clear and you're the only one around.  Suddenly you see a flash of bicycles immediately in front of your headlights and slam on brakes a split second before feeling the horrible bump and crunch. Someone is screaming. You're stunned for a moment in complete disbelief - where could they have come from? You never took your eyes off the road! How could you not see them? You push it from your mind and jump from the car to help. One kid is running up from a ditch, screaming his friends' names as he runs to the nearest. That boy is howling in agony, severely injured but alive. As you approach, both start swearing at you, calling you names and telling you to get away, to call the cops. You saw another bike go flying over your car, so you run back to a shadowy figure on the road behind, dialing 911 as you go.  Dear god. That kid is torn to pieces. You've never seen a human being in that shape before and you have no idea what to do. How do you aid him? Do you touch him? You try talking to him while you look for an uninjured place to lay a hand for comfort. Maybe you try to hold his hand and keep it together even as you want to panic, retch, run, scream. How the fuck did this happen?  You're pretty traumatized during the questioning, but sometime the next day you're allowed to go home. Nothing in the world looks the same though. The boy you tried to talk to is dead, another might not make it. It's weird to see the sun shining and cars driving by like nothing happened as your spouse drives you home. He calls a psychiatrist as soon as you've settled into a chair, staring out a window, replaying everything that happened. Your mind relentlessly questioning why didn't you see the boys. Telling you this was your fault. If only you hadn't left so late. If only you'd had your high beams on. If only...something.  Your story makes the local news and you see the memorial, the grieving family. You wish you could do something for them. Go to the funeral, send flowers, tell them you're sorry. But they don't want to hear from you. To them, you're their son's killer. You understand, so you sit home, unable to eat or even talk. In fact, by the time the police return to talk about the investigation, you're suffering from PTSD as surely as any war veteran.  The cops tell you that the two survivors and evidence have painted a clear picture. The boys were wearing dark clothing on bikes with hardly any reflectors. They road three abreast and did not move to the shoulder even though they surely saw and heard you coming long before you could have seen them. It was a tragedy, but it wasn't your fault. It could have been anyone. Nobody would have been able to see them and stop in time. There will be no charges.  It's little comfort to you, though. Survivor guilt eats at your mind as you go through the motions of daily life. Nothing will ever be the same after seeing what you saw that night. You haven't driven since and never want to again. Just riding in a car makes you panicky and distraught. You can't go back to work. You can't resume your normal activities. Happiness ended that night, and you're just going through the motions now, no matter who was at fault.  But for the sake of your sanity and your family, you try. The psychiatrist is helping a bit. You're holding up as best you can. Your attorney tells you that the families aren't happy with the investigation results; their child is gone and they want someone to be held responsible. You try to be understanding. They're grieving and want more answers. You cooperate and wait for the second investigation to be finalized.  Then your friend or your son or someone else says, hey...I gotta tell you something before you hear it elsewhere. That's when you learn that the parents are spreading rumors. They say you were drunk or texting. They're telling everyone and it's spreading like wildfire. People stare and whisper at the grocery store. Maybe someone even yelled ""murderer!"" as you picked up your mail. Prank calls start, maybe some anonymous mail or ugly posts online show up. You tell the police and shut down the avenues people have to harass you, alienating yourself from your extended family and friends as you do.  Then it hits: you're being served with a massive lawsuit, formalizing those allegations. They want to take everything from you and from your family, to leave you bankrupt if they can. The panic attack hits like a freight train as you digest the news. You break down completely and terrifyingly. Maybe it is your fault. You deserve this. Why weren't you the one who died? You've killed a child, you've ruined your family. Those around you are outraged. They know you didn't text and weren't drunk. You don't deserve this. They want you to heal and move on. You're so emotionally wrecked, you can barely even speak with your own attorney. But your husband is standing strong and tells him to fight it. You've already lost thousands in missed work, paying doctors and psychiatrists and lawyers for something that wasn't even your fault. It's not right, and someone is going to fight for you in this.  The attorney tells you that the best course is to offset their demands with a counter-suit for all the suffering the accident has caused you. You are also a victim here, but instead of letting you heal, these people have dragged matters out, ruined your reputation, unraveled your mental and emotional progress and now threaten you with financial ruin, all for an accident that the police already determined wasn't your fault.  But even this gets taken out of context by the family's lawyers who want to torture you further. They feed a story about how you're suing the victims you killed, as if that's all anyone needs to know. On Reddit, they've rushed to judge you a psychopath, a worthless piece of garbage.  But really, you just wish it had been you who died that night. You don't want this lawsuit, but you do want this nightmare to end. It won't though. The nightmare of running over three kids will replay in your mind for the rest of your life.""  Edit: thanks for the gold people but I can't take the credit for this.

PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,brodoyoueventhrift,19,Thu May 1 15:19:22 2014 UTC,"Except Zimmerman shot that kid. He knowingly pointed a gun at him, and pulled the trigger. The driver did not know anyone was on the road, it's a bit different."
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,l3ri,9,Thu May 1 15:34:37 2014 UTC,"You could easily argue that he didn't want to kill the kid but felt he had no other choice at the point at which it happened.  I'm not here to argue the story or anything and I have my own views on where each party went wrong.  At that moment though, it is possible that Zimmerman felt his life was at great risk and his only chance of survival was to end the threat.  I've never been in the situation donuts difficult to pass fair judgement in my mind"
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,brodoyoueventhrift,5,Thu May 1 16:01:30 2014 UTC,"I believe it is entirely possible that Mr. Zimmerman truly feared for his life. And I believe that we all have the right to defend ourselves if we believe our lives to truly be in danger. The part I don't agree with you about is that you believe these two situations to be similar, and they would be except for one tiny detail. Mr. Zimmerman contacted his local police department who organized his neighborhood watch. They told him an officer was on the way and for him to stop following the kid. He ignored their instructions and because of it a young man is dead. He may have truly thought his life to be in danger, but his blatant disregard of the police is why that Trayvon is dead. These kids hit were riding bikes with few reflectors wearing dark clothing, and riding in the street in the dark. Two COMPLETELY different situations."
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,l3ri,2,Thu May 1 17:48:30 2014 UTC,"I agree, but she also may have been speeding slightly which is a breach of the law.  From my understanding, Zimmerman was not attacked while pursuing Martin bus was instead ambushed on his way back to his car.  Martin's friend explained that he had made it home before deciding to go back after Zimmerman.  At this point I don't think Zimmerman's failure to listen to the dispatcher is more to blame than Martin's aggression toward someone who was no longer a threat in any conceivable way.  This is why I said I'm not trying to discuss the case though.  I don have the 100% truth in either scenario so I can only judge based off the evidence at hand.  I just compare the two in that sometimes it's okay to attempt to understand why the perceived villain acted the way he or she did.  It might not change your opinion on him/her, but at least you can feel better about your opinion ion knowing you were as empathetic as possible.  Also, if my facts about the Zimmerman case are wrong, please correct me.  I can't say I got caught up in all the hooplah, just read up on it when I had the chance.  It's totally possible I missed something."
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,Willard_,1 point,Thu May 1 20:10:06 2014 UTC,"She may have been speeding slighty, and yes that is a breech of the law, but the fact still remains that the kid was doing something INCREDIBLY dangerous. Unless the speed limit was ridiculously low, like 25mph, slightly speeding is not going to really change much. She would have still hit them at a speed high enough to kill him.   And I tried not to get wrapped up in the Zimmerman case either, I did read up on it after as well. It's very unclear what started the physical altercation, but it is crystal clear that the 911 operator told Zimmerman that they did not need him to follow him. He should have let the police handle it. Plain and simple.   I always at least try to understand the villian. Human behavior fascinates me. I just don't think that comparing the way these two particular villians were treated after their crimes makes much sense. They are two completely different set of circumstances."
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,l3ri,-2,Fri May 2 13:30:43 2014 UTC,"He was getting his head bashed against the concrete, he didn't know if the kid had a knife or gun, of course he was fearing for his life.  God that story pissed me off to think about, everyone was saying ""why would you do this? Why didn't he do that."" No one knows what they'll do in scary situations."
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,Willard_,4,Thu May 1 18:09:15 2014 UTC,"The only reason I believe he should have been convicted of murder, was simply because he initiated the confrontation. If he had just done what he was told and left the kid alone, the police could have stopped him and found out that he was living in the neighborhood, and sent him on his way ALIVE. Mr. Zimmerman put himself above the law and sadly picked a fight with someone who could whoop his ass, and when that started to happen and he thought he was going to die he ENDED the life someone who was originally MINDING THEIR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS. I think people aren't appalled that he used his gun to defend himself, it's that he racially profiled someone to be dangerous, ignored instructions from police to stand down, and when Trayvon defended himself and was doing a better job of it he killed him.   Edit: We don't know what actually happened that night, but it is possible that Trayvon was just doing exactly what Mr. Zimmerman did. Defending himself. It's totally possible that Zimmerman started that fight, physically, and it's possible that Trayvon felt threatened and was just defending himself, difference being he didn't have a gun to do so. The whole situation is a mystery except for the part that it would have been avoided had Zimmerman waited for police to show up."
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,l3ri,-1,Thu May 1 18:20:42 2014 UTC,"That's an absurd piece of logic. You could turn the tables and say a girl who was mugged in a bad area shouldn't have been there, but that doesn't make any sense."
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,SlothLikeSin,3,Thu May 1 18:25:34 2014 UTC,"How do you figure? All I'm saying is that Martin wasn't doing anything wrong except he was walking down the street, happened to be black, and had a hood on. To Mr. Zimmerman those are all signs of apparently a robber or whatever reason it was he gave for being suspicious. Doesn't matter. He was suspicious. It's completely conceivable that Mr. Zimmerman approached Mr. Martin. Mr. Zimmerman was not law enforcement. He had no right to stop Mr. Martin or detain him. At least not for walking through the neighborhood. It's not even legal for police to detain someone simply for walking through a neighborhood. They have to have some sort of evidence, or reason to believe that Mr. Martin had committed or was about to commit a crime. If Mr. Zimmerman, non-police, tried to detain him and Mr. Martin knew his rights, and that he didn't have to stand for that, it is easily plausible that a physical altercation broke out. Hell, it's even plausible that Mr. Zimmerman was just asking some polite questions and Mr. Martin was being rude and telling him to mind his own fucking business, but either way Zimmerman was not an officer of the law. He was part of neighborhood WATCH. Their job is to watch and report. Not confront. Stopping someone and trying to detain them without actually seeing them commit a crime is actually considered false imprisonment, and possibly kidnapping. It's completely conceivable that in this situation Zimmerman started a physical altercation and Martin was defending himself, but because he didn't have a gun, he used what he had. His fists, and his bodily strength.   I do not understand how you think my logic can be turned into victim blaming."

PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,RLNvalet,0,Thu May 1 17:53:22 2014 UTC,Martin had none? it seems to me that Zimmerman shot Martin after Martin jumped him. Martin assuming that Zimmerman was enough of a threat to warrant assaulting him is not far off the same stupidity that led Zimmerman to assume Martin was worth following in the first place.   De-escalation could have come from either party. A simple discussion between them might have easily de-escalated this.
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,RLNvalet,0,Thu May 1 18:48:47 2014 UTC,"Martin didn't jump Zimmerman. Zimmerman stalked and then confronted Martin, and what happened from there is anyone's guess because Martin is dead and Zimmerman wouldn't tell the truth if it hurt him.  For all we know, Zimmerman could have pulled out the gun and threatened Martin with it. Hell, if Martin was beating the living shit out of Zimmerman, how would he have found the time to pull out a gun, hit the safety, then shoot?  And if the safety was off to begin with, then Zimmerman is even more to blame -- he went into the situation looking to shoot Martin."
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,xfloggingkylex,2,Thu May 1 19:07:57 2014 UTC,"The keltec pf9 does not have an external safety as one would expect from many modern DOA designs. There is overwhelming physical evidence that the shot was fired upwards at point blank/contact shots. In other words Zimmerman was supine and fired upwards into his attackers chest. Testimony of the key eyewitness was consistent with Martin atop Zimmerman   And if the safety was off to begin with, then Zimmerman is even more to blame -- he went into the situation looking to shoot Martin.   Pretty thin stuff. Being followed isn't justification for trying to literally beat a man's brains out. Having your skull smashed into hard surfaces is likely to kill you, and the universal laws of man and God allow you to kill your attacker to make him stop doing that to you. The forensic evidence and the bulk of the testimony alike were consistent with Zimmerman's account of self-defense."

PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,gifforc,2,Thu May 1 21:04:29 2014 UTC,Okay. Interesting. no mention of that in the other article. Thanks for the info. The family even accused her of being drunk. I wonder why they would make that accusation if that test had been done.
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,succexxyy,1 point,Thu May 1 21:38:51 2014 UTC,"Well, the thing, it's a pre-breathalyzer test.  It isn't accepted as evidence in court, but refusing one is a crime.  Weird, but that's Canada.  So it is technically true so say she didn't have a breathalyzer test.  The other thing that people have been keying in on is the fact that her husband's a cop.  And that's all you need to throw the word ""CONSPRIACY"" into the mix because literally, no matter what evidence does or doesn't get presented, people will automatically assume it's because her husband used the blue wall.    That very well could be true, but it could also equally not be true at all.  We should pretend like we don't know the answer to all this and just go by the facts, that's all I'm saying."

He alleges Simon was speeding and may have been intoxicated and talking on her cellphone.  That's from the Toronto Sun article you posted.  Obviously the more sensational headline is saying the driver who killed the kids is suing, which is true, but the facts show that they initiated the civil suit.  Whether this was on behalf of their insurance companies (might explain the use of the word 'routine) or not, her counter-suit is most likely a way to provide a perspective that they're lawyers won't.  On it's face, without knowing that the family's sued first, it absolutely seems cruel and greedy.  All the speculation is part of that narrative.  Theatrics in order to panic her insurance company to give up a settlement.  If her husband is covering up for anything, then they should go to hell, but there was a through investigation who were keenly aware that people might think that and they kept everything as transparent as possible."

The driver asking for money makes more sense, but what's been asked is too much. That person lost a lot of money trying to fight something that wasn't completely its fault. The family should have been more aware of their children. Both are somewhat responsible for what happen, it's unfair for both parts to completely blame each other in this case."

They were wearing dark clothing, minimal reflectors (not flashing lights, just the standard plastic reflector piece) and were riding abreast.    Riding abreast means they were not riding behind in each in a line on the side of the road.  The kid who was killed was in middle of the road, literally.  This was a straight, paved road.

I cannot imagine how devastated the parents must feel, but they are the one's doing the suing.  Her counter-suit allows her to name herself as a victim in a situation that she has suffered for something that was ruled not her fault.  At this point, the rumors coming from all angles are things she cannot defend herself against because there is a court case pending.

There was no breath test because the officer on site and investigating officers didn't smell any alcohol. The only reason you would get a breath test is if you smelled alcohol at suspected it might be a part of the accident... Here that did not occur, there's only one logical conclusion to draw from that which is the alcohol was not involved.  As for texting…. This was a death investigation. You can damn well believe that the investigating officers took that investigation very very seriously.  As part of the investigation you can believe that they checked her cell phone for text as well as her phone bill and her post on social media. This was a death investigation!  The fact that this article doesn't go into great detail about how much investigation the officers dead does not mean that there was no investigation it simply means that they found nothing to put her at fault and the idiot kid writing and dark colors and the middle the road was to blame for his own demise."
PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,themanifoldcuriosity,-37,Fri May 2 14:24:39 2014 UTC,"Gonna try to not be too argumentative, because I understand that this isn't your comment.  This entire thing is broken. But I can still sympathize with the troubles brought on both sides. However, the right thing to do would be to fight the charges, and leave it at that. Suing someone you killed, even accidentally, because you're guilty and it's had a negative impact on your life, does in fact make you a psychopath, and a worthless piece of garbage, or maybe just incredibly stupid. They most certainly did not make this decision hoping to get out of their sticky situation and be happy again. She has multiple kids, and I can basically guarantee she's in it for the money. I've been told that the sue is a counter-sue, a legendary defense tactic, which can only be used by those trained in the long lost art of heroism. Lvl. 50 required. (Sorry for the sarcasm, I have no problem with her taking said defensive action. The sarcasm is a direct attack at the person who originally made this comment, who, as discussed below, turned a potentially solid comment, into a tear factory. T-T)  This comment antagonizes the victims. Acting almost as if they sent their son off to die so they can torment this ""poor innocent soul"". The comment goes in depth through the troubles of the driver, and when it's time to talk about the victim's, it's kept short and sweet: ""They want to take everything from you, and from your family, to leave you bankrupt if they can.""  The comment does a really good job of shedding light on the horrors of being the bad guy. And while it makes me hate her a whole lot less than I did when I read the title of the OP, this comment is repulsive.   Edit: -sigh- I'm getting so much shit for this comment. False shit, I might add.   ""this comment is repulsive.""  To clarify, comment means comment, not person, not story, not the person who posted the comment, not the people who agree with the comment, but the comment itself. Not for what it stands for, but it's form. The comment is repulsive, the same way a movie, with potential, but bad actors is repulsive. A decent enough story is slandered by a really bad accent, while the actor stares at the camera too much, and says his lines early. He tries to improvise, but all that comes out is an inappropriate joke, that no one laughs at. Would it not be repulsive if you were watching Pulp Fiction, and Tommy Wiseau walked in with a katana, and shouted ""OH NO! THEY'RE RAPING HIM!"" in that really shitty accent?  I'm going over board, the metaphor I'm trying to present, is execution. The comment has a good message, that I agree with: The driver did nothing wrong, it was an accident.  However, the execution was a nightmare. The story puts too much effort into burying the victim's losses, slandering them with something as crude as ""They want to take everything from you, and from your family, to leave you bankrupt if they can."", and the bulk of the comment is just an attempt to bury these messages, in an over saturated sob story for the driver. My comment was little more than a negative review, and while my personal opinion's eventually popped up, that was not supposed to be the focus. I have since then been educated in how a case like this works, and will change my comment accordingly."

And I said hate her less, not hate. I could of said liked her more, but that would imply that upon originally hearing somebody was suing a dead person, that I liked them. Quite frankly, I think if you take somebody to court for accidentally running over your son, when he was largely at fault, kind of makes you an asshole too. I didn't pick anybodies side in my comment, I was trying to point out that the original comment did picked sides, and was a little too biased.

Because your claiming that someone should abstain from taking a perfectly reasonable protective legal measure (that any lawyer would most definitely have suggested) because ""it makes them look like an asshole"" to some ignorant internet fuckface - just makes you look like aforementioned ignorant internet fuckface. I find it laughable how you think ""It makes me hate her ... less"" could ever be seen as ambiguous. You clearly meant and could only mean ""I hated her before and now I hate her less than I did."" What is confusing is how you plan to explain how you saying ""hate someone less"" could ever suggest that you never hated them in the first place, as you're claiming now.

As I've already stated, the word hate is based on my first impression, which was born upon reading the title: ""Driver who killed teen is suing dead boy's family for $1 million."" Is that not, at first glance, hate worthy? As I said, the bulk of my comment, wasn't opinion. The last paragraph had plenty of opinion in it, but unfortunately, one paragraph does not automatically become the majority, simply because you're incapable of reading the rest. I was talking about how the comment antagonizes the family, and glorifies the driver.

Now, back to the completely irrelevant conversation you're looking to get into. They were being stupid, biking in the dark, no reflectors, fair enough. But I feel like they already paid a price, I mean, they did die. I guess maybe the driver felt like her PTSD was worth a million dollars... And a life.

But for the child to be riding in the dark wearing dark clothing, no lights, and very few reflectors is just dangerous and makes it absolutely ridiculous that they expected this woman not to hit their child. I just don't agree with the family at all in this situation and if I was the driver, I would totally counter sue as well. It  was an ACCIDENT, she didn't hit your child on purpose, and she probably does feel truly horrible. Isn't that enough?

PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,Eslader,-1,Thu May 1 08:30:52 2014 UTC,What? Nothing in that article says anything like that. The lady said she is suing because of the emotional grief she is feeling and that the boys were negligent bike riders. She doesn't mention that she is suing because of slander or degradation of character. Not to mention she was speeding yet in another lawsuit she is suing the city for not maintaining the roads properly. This lady has done nothing but play victim and has yet to accept responsibility. So where are you getting this information that the victims family is committing slander?

A roadside screening device was administered “out of an abundance for caution,” the report said, and registered “zero alcohol content in her blood system.  So, we're talking about going 55mph on a 50mph road, that paints a different picture than just saying ""speeding""  She was screened on the scene and found to have zero alcohol in her system and as far as the texting thing, it's unsubstantiated.    Oh and she is the one doing the counter-suing.  The parents obviously are distressed over the fact that the investigation found her not culpable and are looking to a civil suit as a way to get closure.

PeopleBeingJerks,24e8zi,Eslader,-5,Wed Apr 30 21:19:29 2014 UTC,"As I said to someone else, I'm having trouble determining if those accusations were made before or after the driver filed the lawsuit.   That said, assuming they were made before the lawsuit, I'd be more likely to sue them for defamation/libel/slander if I sued them at all over it... Which speaking personally I probably would not.   I get that grieving people sometimes do and say things that are unfortunate, and I don't see the need to lump legal troubles onto their grief unless they cross a line and start damaging my reputation in ways that matter (employment, etc). And if they cross that line, I'd much rather start by having an attorney tell them quietly and hopefully politely to knock it off rather than slapping them with a lawsuit."

You can't really sit down and talk to them about it and have them completely understand why their behavior is not acceptable. especially when they're in the middle of a ""grand mal"" tantrum.

Believe me, I completely understand the frustration and anger when my son acts like this but I would never EVER drag him 10 feet down the street then spank him so hard that you can hear & FEEL each slap. Before you leave the hospital with your child, when the nurse gives you the speech about what it's going to be like when you get home, they tell you that you WILL get frustrated enough that you'll want to flip out like this but to NEVER act on it. Like you said, you should let it ride out.A 2 year old can not and will not understand what he/she did to deserve to be hit like that. If somebody is hitting their child like that then there's an issue with the parenting, not the child's behavior because the child's behavior is expected but that kind of parenting IS NOT..

PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,maddog1404,-2,Thu Apr 24 18:13:12 2014 UTC,in her stockings?
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,legin2010,-2,Thu Apr 24 13:25:31 2014 UTC,yes
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,KittyCLawe,1 point,Thu Apr 24 13:28:13 2014 UTC,So all that happened in this video was the kid laying on the ground throwing a tantrum.  She then spanked her a couple times in the butt.  I did not see any abuse.  There was about 20 seconds of that and the rest was a bunch of people walking around yelling.  Not sure what the uproar is here.
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,KittyCLawe,5,Thu Apr 24 13:43:55 2014 UTC,The kid got dragged from the ground....that's abuse.
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,NotOldEnough,-10,Thu Apr 24 14:37:01 2014 UTC,Kids are not made of glass.
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,CookieCrackenbush,4,Thu Apr 24 16:13:03 2014 UTC,"No shit, asshole. However, dragging a BABY on the ground is wrong. It doesn't matter, ""what they are made out of.""   You are a real piece of shit. Imagine if someone did this to your kid. WOuld you say, ""oh, he's not made of glass, you can drag him on the shitty ground all you want."" I understand you are trying to make a shitty point, but that's just it - it's shitty. You are a shithead for condoning shit like this."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,SinkHoleDeMayo,-3,Thu Apr 24 16:45:10 2014 UTC,"Well I wouldn't spank someone else's kid.  Nor would I want someone to spank my kid.  However I would spank my own kid.  This is obviously her child.  This is rougher than you would be with your kids.  But, that doesn't mean she is an abusive mother.  She picked her up trying to get her to walk.  She refused and went limp so yes she was drug a few feet.  Then she was spanked a couple times in the ass.  I agree she was rough, but a dont agree she was publicly abusing her child."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,maddog1404,1 point,Thu Apr 24 16:55:58 2014 UTC,She's not hitting and dragging a 10 year old. She's hitting and dragging a toddler. The mother needs counseling and so do any of you who think youngsters should be subject to smacking and pushing around. That is not parenting. It's abuse.
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,SinkHoleDeMayo,-11,Thu Apr 24 17:51:36 2014 UTC,"Haha, you prick, you clearly don't know what abuse ACTUALLY looks like. I bet you tried to call the cops on your mom when she wouldn't let you have ice cream. Don't have kids. You'll perpetuate the growth of spoiled, undisciplined, self-entitled dickwads."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,maddog1404,5,Fri Jun 13 16:19:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah - while you, on the other hand, will smash your kid for doing something insignificant. And while I was lucky enough to not have been ACTUALLY abused, I can make the guess that you probably have been, which is why you have such a shitty attitude towards these types of things.   I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. How is what that lady did Ok.. where is the logic in that? The baby is reliant on her mother.. and she drags him/her through the street. Maybe that's ok in ass-backwards place you come from, but it's not Ok where I come from, you uncivilized jerk-off."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,legin2010,0,Thu Apr 24 17:02:47 2014 UTC,"I would never say that my loving and caring parents ever abused me. I thank them for disciplining me, and making sure I grew up to be a person that is cognizant of when public upset is warranted. Btw if you think California is back-assward, like others who do, then don't fucking come here. Or gtfo."

PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,legin2010,3,Thu Apr 24 17:18:31 2014 UTC,"Spanking I can understand, dragging a child across concrete I cannot. She was winding up on those hits too...that's not discipline any more."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,SinkHoleDeMayo,4,Thu Apr 24 17:28:53 2014 UTC,That and the fact of how she was yanking the child up could of dislocated a shoulder.
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,santacruzer7,-5,Thu Apr 24 17:07:48 2014 UTC,"You're not either, so does that mean because you're bigger you would have no problem with me coming over and punching you in the face? Cause you know, you're not glass, so you're not going to break."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,santacruzer7,5,Thu Apr 24 18:10:09 2014 UTC,"How is that even a comparison?  Had this been a crying infant she was doing this to than yes, that would be abusive.  This kid is at an age where discipline actually makes a difference.  Was she aggressive?  Yes.  Is the mom a bitch?  More than likely.  Should she be arrested for beating her child?  No."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,pimpdawg2010,-2,Thu Apr 24 18:47:31 2014 UTC,Just because your asshole type behavior won't kill someone doesn't mean you get a pass.
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,-Terriermon-,1 point,Thu Apr 24 19:44:05 2014 UTC,So you think that I should look to you to tell me how to raise and discipline my kids?  I really don't give two fucks if you give me a pass or not.  My kid is going to know what is appropriate and what is not.

PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,maddog1404,1 point,Thu Apr 24 23:03:48 2014 UTC,Maybe it's just me but I don't see the big deal in spanking a child.
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,Dill-usional,1 point,Thu Apr 24 16:10:28 2014 UTC,"Hitting a child is the easy way, at the time. Real parents understand that it takes love and patience to raise a child. This mother demonstrates neither.  There is NEVER a reason to hit a child as young as this child in the video. NEVER."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,KittyCLawe,1 point,Wed May 7 14:57:34 2014 UTC,It also takes discipline. Sometimes all a child needs a good swat and a time out.
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,Dill-usional,1 point,Fri Jun 13 16:15:50 2014 UTC,"I don't share your view that hitting a child is ever the answer. I learned discipline from my parents sitting me down and talking to me, setting expectations and praising good behavior. It takes more effort and more patience, but it, I believe, is far more effective in the end."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,KittyCLawe,1 point,Fri Jun 13 16:27:47 2014 UTC,"How many times do you think a child is actually going to retain more than 10% of what you said? There's nothing wrong with spanking, everyone I know had it done to them and they're not emotionally scared. In fact, they encourage it."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,Dill-usional,1 point,Fri Jun 13 17:26:38 2014 UTC,"I don't share your view. You learned to hit and so you feel that is a good enough reason to hit. I learned another way to communicate that doesn't involve hitting. I suggest that you talk to your child before they go to the stage that causes you to lose it. Put your arm around them and tell them you love them, but that you want them to behave. Talk to them. It takes more time, but it's far better than saving time by striking them. That is what you are doing by hitting them, saving yourself time. Think about it, please."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,legin2010,1 point,Fri Jun 13 17:31:30 2014 UTC,It was effective. It shut us all up. So yeah it did work. Not saying there won't be love before it comes to hitting but I'm not taking a good swat out of the equation.
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,santacruzer7,-6,Fri Jun 13 21:07:49 2014 UTC,"guess the little brat should have stood up, shut the fuck up and behaved. kid was spanked in his butt -- no permanent damage likely occurred.    kid was wearing shoes -- not like his feet were being scraped bloody. fuck that shit - now he knows that screaming and tantrums won't get him anywhere. kids that are allowed to lay there in a tantrum until they get their way grow up to be assholes who steal your parking space, yell at waiters and cause a scene in public wherever they go.  good mom."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,Dill-usional,4,Sat Jun 14 02:06:12 2014 UTC,"Although what you are saying is a little harsh, I do agree to point.  It looked really bad like she was beating the kid, but really the kid was throwing a tantrum and she was spanking him/her.  The rest of the video was just a bunch of people yelling.  I dont speak Chinese, so I have no idea what they were saying.  But, i feel this video is taken a bit out of context where as it looks like the lade is beating the kid and he/she is laying in pain when really the kid was throwing a tantrum and not wanting to walk."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,santacruzer7,1 point,Thu Apr 24 14:21:57 2014 UTC,Are you fucking kidding me? You don't drag a baby across concrete by the arm and then drop them and smack them repeatedly in the middle of the street. She's barely even a toddler. Go to hell asshole
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,Dill-usional,-4,Thu Apr 24 14:34:30 2014 UTC,"Again, another prick that clearly has never been disciplined. You dumb piece of fuck, you realize what most adults around you had to physically go through when they were children? MUCH fucking worse than that, and all within the realm of legal parenting."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,santacruzer7,2,Thu Apr 24 16:57:41 2014 UTC,That doesn't make it right fuckstick. A child is the only person in the entire fucking world who trusts you unconditionally and you beat the shit out of it because you get a little frustrated.

PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,Dill-usional,-5,Thu Apr 24 17:07:36 2014 UTC,"Never said anyone is getting the shit beat out of them. That child was fine, that drag was the mother giving the child one last chance to act mature, when she didn't, she was waiting, and standing up for her right to not be controlled by the child's emotions."
PeopleBeingJerks,23uf05,santacruzer7,3,Thu Apr 24 17:21:59 2014 UTC,"Two year olds aren't supposed to be mature, because they're TWO.

PeopleBeingJerks,2348hg,hupa,7,Tue Apr 15 19:27:25 2014 UTC,"This is in the UK. Unless this is a council owned car park (most here are owned and managed by private companies these days), it's not illegal to park in a disabled space. It is private land so the rules are set by the businesses and aren't enforceable by law. To quote the DirectGov website:   If a non-disabled motorist parks in a disabled space in a private car park they can be asked to leave. But it can't be legally insisted. For instance at a supermarket, an employee can ask the driver to move their car from the reserved space. But they can't legally insist on it.    Nevertheless it's rude and selfish."

There almost seems to be a weird stigma where one isn't allowed to be a fan of soccer and the more American sports at the same time.

PeopleBeingJerks,2303zh,phantomsignal,7,Mon Apr 14 16:41:18 2014 UTC,I like soccer even though I prefer American sports. I'll watch as much of the World Cup as I can.

PeopleBeingJerks,2303zh,Bleedthebeat,6,Tue Apr 22 18:12:38 2014 UTC,Huge is a drastic overstatement. There isn't nearly the advantage to flopping in the NFL as there is in soccer - in soccer with the right team you'll literally see dozens of flops in a game. In the NFL you might see it once.

PeopleBeingJerks,2303zh,AztecFrostKng,6,Mon Apr 14 17:06:56 2014 UTC,"That's a poor example. There is no incentive for a defensive lineman to go down, in fact the most called foul in that situation would be holding and in most cases that would involve the player standing up, trying to get away. I've seen football players emphasize holding calls but not often.   A good example in the NFL would be a wide reciever going down after some contact with a DB."
PeopleBeingJerks,2303zh,AztecFrostKng,-19,Mon Apr 14 17:13:30 2014 UTC,"There is no incentive for a defensive lineman to go down,   Right, because American football has ZERO tolerance for raging faggotry like that."

The other comment didn't last too long.  And to counter: It's because in American football, you EXPECT someone to be on the ground after an O LINE/ D LINE battle. In soccer, you aren't supposed to see someone go down randomly because of an elbow. There would be no punishment in the NFL for that because it's normal, there would be punishment in soccer because it's not normal. And the punishment would be severe: a red card or a penalty. That's why players do it.   It's crappy and I hate it (as I said from the very beginning) and leagues are making efforts to stop it. No fan enjoys seeing someone flop. No one. My point was that it happens in all sports, and soccer gets unfairly judged because of it.   Arguing with you seems fairly fruitless (we came back to the beginning of the discussion;full circle) so I'll let you have whatever nonesense macho thing you have to say as the last word."

In the MLS (the league that this game was from), we now have the Disciplinary Committee. What the DC does is that it goes over the games after they have been completed and hands out fines and game suspensions for things the refs either missed, or they think werent harsh enough (for example, say there was a rough tackle and the ref gives a yellow card, the DC can go back and suspend that player for a few weeks and also fine the player personally (this does happen quite often actually))  Just thought I would try to improve the views of the sport"

As for the reasoning to why they are so harsh on players here (as I said in response to another comment from the post on /r/soccer)   It's one of the many things they have to do in order to grow the sport in this country. American sports fans who are on the fence about soccer (or who just blindly hate it) tend to jump at any opportunity to point out how blatant diving and play-acting put the entire sport's legitimacy into question. The MLS leadership want to continue to convert people into fans, so they have to swing the gavel hard at this sort of nonsense. In the end, I think it will help a lot, and the league we'll have in 10-20 years will be better for it. I just hope they don't soften up on punishment for this sort of thing as the league continues to gain popularity.   There is no real ""sin bin"" in soccer because most of the players have to stay on the field for the whole game, but believe me, there is A LOT of booing if the crowd sees stuff like this live.

I only go into threads where sure as fuck it's gonna turn into some dude from England or Brazil making sarcastic remarks about how we can't possibly understand THE BEAUTIFUL GAME because after all we can't even figure out what real football is and we're all fat and stupid and would rather watch beer commercials than play.  The biggest challenge to it is this: our seasons are already spoken for. Football in the fall/winter, hockey in the fall/winter, followed by baseball in the spring/summer and basketball same thing.  In many instances, soccer, a niche sport played by little girls and worshipped by Mexicans and other people who don't typically interact with everyone else - would do nothing but cannibalize other markets. (Not clowning on soccer per se: but it IS played by little girls, just as how ""rounders"" and ""netball"" (baseball and basketball) are played by girls, as is field hockey, in Europe.  And Americans like drama (why baseball is in our consciousness is beyond me.) Nothing quite like the home team being down by 4 as the fourth quarter is winding down and the defense HAS to get the ball back, or a buzzer beater in a close basketball game. Soccer, by its very nature, is about appreciating nuances of high levels of play that most people don't have the experience to understand, and there's really not that much that can make a highlight reel the same way a guy who's triple covered catching a 40yd throw in the end zone or someone getting hipchecked through the boards can.  ""Ooh, that was a cheeky little ball to Romaldinyo... he's got to score and OH MY GOD HE MISSED THAT SHOT BY SIX FEET BUT OH MY GOD WHAT A GOOD TRY..."" don't cut it."

Couple of teams I support in that regard, as well.   and there are some amazing Canadian and American players that play here in North America.   Indeed.   I agree with you on seasons, the MLS doesnt really have its own season and seriously conflicts with NFL, which has been a huge problem for them.   Right. And given how BIG football is here, you're basically asking sports guys to take time, resources and attention from what their son is doing on the field (and you're hoping for dat scholarship), and giving attention to what the daughter plays just for fun.    I would however disagree with you highly saying that soccer is a ""niche sport"".    In the USA, it is a niche sport. One of the reasons I support a certain UK team is because in part that that team is one of the few whose games regularly made it for broadcast in the US. (Also, family came from that area.)   Its the most played and watched sport in the world by far.    Yeah I know. It's huge in Saudi Arabia and Africa and Europe and all other kinds of places that hate us and look down on us (when they're not asking us if they can come here)   The FIFA World Cup is the most watched sporting event in the world, and even on a more local level, the EA FIFA games are their best selling sports games.    FIFA soccer is fun. No word of a lie.    I would even go as far to say hockey and football are more niche sports.    I'd suggest that the Philadelphia Flyers had more supporters than the Philadelphia oh shit I'd have to look up the name of their MLS team.   Soccer all you need is a ball and a few friends and you can play,    Right, which is why we have kids play it. To play it you just need a ball (or in some parts of the world, a spherical-object kinda, like some rags tied together, or a severed head) and the ability to kick a ball and run. Toddlers have these skills. Never seen a toddler throw a wicked spiral to a guy running a slant. Ever.   the basic concept is simple enough for anyone. Hockey you cant really play properly unless you have ice, a puck and sticks, and football has so many rules even long time fans dont understand them all.   Football is an incredibly demanding sport. Cerebrally, physically in terms of brute strength, and physically in terms of stamina and endurance. Go check out what's involved in the combine, Europeans, and you'll see some of the most well-rounded athletes on earth.   You can't just ""pickup football"" - how are you gonna run plays if the people don't know what those are?   As a Canadian, I personally dont understand why people like american football.    And you've got that right. Suffice it to say that it combines high drama, strategy, brute force, sprinting, stamina, mental toughness, a high level of skill, and physical toughness. NFL stands for ""Not For Long"" - and few are in the over 30 club, ya know?   Ill watch the highlights, and I can respect someone whose triple covered catching a 40yd throw, that is impressive. But to me, so is watching a striker dance through a teams entire defense and take an amazing shot that beats the keeper.   The thing is, football has plays like that on the regular. You gotta comb through an entire season to see a play like the one you describe.   I admit, soccer is a slow sport, watching an entire game can be boring at times    Whereas football never is. You have two enemies: the clock and the other team, and keeping an eye on both is a real nail biter, even if they're standing in a huddle strategizing for the next play.   and doesnt have the quick drama that football hockey and basketball has. But it has its flashes of brilliance and skill that can make the highlight reel in any country.   But it's few and far between. Also, to understand Roberto Baggio mowing through ten people like butter and flicking kicks to himself and pounding the ball in requires you to understand what in hell is going on - whereas just about anyone can appreciate a 350lb man running a 5.4 second 40 yd to mow down a quarterback, a wide receiver sprinting with a ball he caught thrown to him from behind, or as you say, a guy wearing three men still managing to execute a basketball player's vertical and catching a spirally thrown ball with lights in his eyes.  And so long as Europeans scoff it's just a bunch of fat guys hitting each other followed by a beer commercial, I'm going to scoff that kicking a ball is something toddlers do on the regular, just to piss them off back."

There shouldn't be a solution for that. Once that kid hits the real world and gets a real job, he's not gonna be able to go to his boss and say ""I don't feel like working in the way that all your other employees work. I'm just gonna do my own thing and you're gonna pay me anyway."" He'll be fired before he finishes the sentence.   I've been watching how schools have changed since I was in them (to give an idea, I was done with school long before NCLB was ever conceived, so they've changed a lot). On one hand, there are some really great changes. STEAM is a fantastic idea. There's an elementary school in my state that's a STEAM school focused on aerospace. If I had a kid that age I'd be tempted to move just to send her there.  But there's an ugly flip side to those advances. There's also a public arts school in my area that lets kids do their own non-mainstream thing, class requirements are lax, etc. These kids end up getting lots of respect from their peers because they focus the entire day on whatever they happen to be interested in. And the teachers encourage it, the undertone of their message being ""Do this and you'll do just fine when you graduate."" These kids aren't pushed to learn math and science. Even the science classes don't really teach science - they teach ""science from an artist's perspective"" and bullcrap like that.   The kids in that school are going to graduate and then discover that they don't have any qualifications that will make them any money. Sure, one or two might get lucky and end up being a successful actor or the next Thomas Kincaid, but relying on that is like the kid in a traditional high school neglecting his coursework because he plans to be in the NFL. Getting to that level in entertainment is just about like winning the lottery. Very, very few people make it, and those that don't and who didn't have a backup plan end up in a world of hurt.  So, the thrust of this overly long post is that a certain amount of enforced conformity is a good thing. I'm not saying that kids should be non-thinking regurgitation machines who only get A's as long as they vomit up exactly what the teacher told them when taking tests, as was the fashion when I was in school. But we've swung too far the other way. If we don't impress upon kids that their entire working life will be spent doing what other people tell them to do (whether it's their boss or if they own their own business, their customers) and instead let them be ""non-mainstream"" to the point where they do whatever the hell they feel like doing, then we're setting them up for economic disaster."

PeopleBeingJerks,20ymxx,witeowl,-1,Sat Mar 29 23:32:06 2014 UTC,"Those things go hand in hand most of the time. The autism spectrum contains many forms of social anxiety where people don't understand how to behave in social interaction with others. Meanwhile normal people don't realize this and think of it as just general asshole behaviour. This is why many cases of autism remain undiagnosed and untreated for so long. I guarantee you, if they would pop some ritalin in that guy he would behave a hell of a lot better."

PeopleBeingJerks,20ymxx,witeowl,2,Thu Apr 3 01:54:35 2014 UTC,"I've worked with many students on the autism spectrum. None of them would act anything like this ass. They're not necessarily all angels in the classroom, but they sure as hell wouldn't be pulling this shit and laughing about it.   Moreover, I've had students with behavior like this in a few of my classes (not that they would get as far in my class). The vast majority of them had zero disabilities beyond being behind academically. Now, being behind academically and acting out in class: which came first? That's a chicken and egg question for the ages."

I don't know the specifics of this case so there's every possibility that the poor bugger is indeed lagging behind academically and that this abnormal excessive behaviour is a result of that. But then I'm curious, what's your assessment on a combination treatment of a Ritalin-class drug in combination with behaviour modification therapy? Personally I believe this would have a high chance of marked behavioural improvements in this case."

A desire to curb the misbehavior is still an issue, and I don't see this kid wishing he could control his impulses. Then again, even the best psychiatrist/psychologist wouldn't be able to make any sort of diagnosis or prediction on a video, so I'm reluctant to say anything more."

PeopleBeingJerks,205xxf,vibrate,3,Sun Apr 27 18:41:26 2014 UTC,The more expensive one is for import beers. This video has been posted for about two years now and every time people point this out. It's not a corporate trick.

There is a third cup for large domestics which isn't shown in the video.  So they are comparing cup sizes for two separate options, not the regular vs large domestic."
PeopleBeingJerks,205xxf,TakeItToTheMax,-6,Tue Mar 11 22:57:12 2014 UTC,"DRAUGHT BEER  • REGULAR $4.00  • LARGE $7.00  MICROBREW $7.00  So Draught beer is $4 for a small, $7 for a large.  A microbrew is $7.00, presumably for a regular.  Also the video isn't just about the price, it's about the size comparison between small and large beakers."
PeopleBeingJerks,205xxf,me_and_batman,2,Tue Mar 11 23:16:37 2014 UTC,"The two cups being compared are: 1. a regular draught/domestic (whatever) and 2. A microbrew.  There is a third option, the large draught, which isn't part of the comparison and isn't shown by the two guys.  So while the intention is to compare the sizes of the same thing (regular vs large draught). What they are actually comparing is two different menu items.   Would you expect a 6oz ribeye steak to cost exactly the same as a 6oz filet mignon? No, so you can't compare the difference in prices between a 6oz ribeye and an 8oz filet mignon and then say ""Hey I'm paying so much more for only 2oz!"" No you are paying more for a different item.  Again, I can read a sign. What I'm saying is the guys making the video are mistaken and it has been pointed out every time this kind of video is posted on reddit.  http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1usn5o/comparison_of_large_beer_vs_small_beer_at_qwest/celfnf1  http://business.time.com/2011/01/13/seattle-stadium-beer-scandal-same-amount-of-beer-whether-you-pay-7-25-or-8-50/  http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/khe1j/small_and_large_beer_are_almost_the_same_size/c2kb9oz"

I see nothing to convince me this isn't the case so I'm not sure how you can make the assumption that one is imported (and no doubt far superior) and the other is domestic.

PeopleBeingJerks,205xxf,billmofomurray,0,Tue Mar 11 21:53:27 2014 UTC,"The two cups in the video are for a regular domestic and a large microbrew. Not a regular vs large domestic, as they are leading you to believe. There is a third sized cup that the two guys either aren't aware of or aren't showing.  Microbrews are almost always more expensive than domestics, which is the reason why a little bit more is a lot more expensive.

The family knew that it was a type of OCD, but I didn't tell them what I have found.  I now also own a Border Collie (crossed with something else). We've never done the laser thing when she was little. I tried it recently, but she is unresponsive to the laser, after initially being surprised by it."

Someone had stuck one of the shovels in the sand, and one of the guys on the team tried to jump over it. He would have made it if his shirt hadn't caught onto the handle. He fell back onto the shovel handle (similar to the GIF) and was brutally sodomized by it. You wouldn't have been able to tell because it was through his shorts. You could tell he was in pain but he walked it off and went to the bathroom. He didn't come back to help. As we were leaving, he was near the bathroom door and asked if everyone was gone. I said ""yeah, are you ok?"" and he just kind of put his head down and shuffled to his car.  Fast forward a bit: turns out the shovel completely tore his lower intestine and undergo major surgery, he had to have a colostomy bag attached to his stomach for the next 18 months. His new nickname you ask? ...Shovel ass. :(  Poor guy."

PeopleBeingJerks,1xtbo2,bumbletowne,-3,Thu Feb 13 19:08:51 2014 UTC,Because he tried to kiss someone without their permission just because some stupid camera told him to invade her personal space.
PeopleBeingJerks,1xtbo2,RockFan2012,2,Fri Feb 14 00:24:45 2014 UTC,"Well it's obviously staged. Also, that's the fucking point of the kiss cam. It's like mistletoe.  She should have just kissed him lightly for the kiss cam, then told him she wasn't interested. She was a total bitch, but that was the point of the video."
PeopleBeingJerks,1xtbo2,JakeofNewYork,7,Fri Feb 14 03:10:45 2014 UTC,"Nobody does mistletoe who doesn't already have consent. You stand under it and then it initiates an opportunity to kiss. You still have to get permissions (guy or gal). You would get sued, slapped, or charged with sexual harassment. Personal space is a serious issue.   Seriously.   Some areas of the world are more lax about this, but it's better to cover your ass."
PeopleBeingJerks,1xtbo2,RockFan2012,-7,Fri Feb 14 00:32:16 2014 UTC,"oh its obviously staged, he says with no explanation as to why. No its really not, thats  a pretty solid slap right there. And yeah the entire fucking poing of the kiss cam is creepy and stupid and invasive. Nobody should have to do something with their body they don't fucking want to, and the fact that its become socially acceptable for entire stadiums of people to force someone to do that is disgusting. He was a total asshole for being so stupid as to think that just because a camera told him to do it it was okay. No one owes anyone access to their body for something so trite and useless as to entertain a bunch of slack draws who still think kissing is funny because they're still 12 or because you oh master of respect think its the nice thing to do. And like the other responder said, mistletoe is no more acceptable."

PeopleBeingJerks,1xmsea,clouds_become_unreal,6,Tue Feb 11 20:12:09 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure the car floats. It wasn't the weight [DENSITY!] it was the forward rotation that was the problem.

Let's break down your ""logic.""   heavy objects sink   First of all, this is not inherently true. Ships are pretty heavy and they float just fine. Do you need a lesson in buoyancy? Weight (mass) of the object is only one factor in the equation. Secondly, it's a fucking toy car made out of plastic. It's not heavy AT ALL.   they would have known the cart wasn't going to float   The car did float. It's clearly floating. It's made out of plastic and plastic floats.  The problem is that it's TOO buoyant and just tilted too far forward. It practically bounces off the water when the nose hits.  And lastly, getting back to the root of my point, it's pretty obvious that they're trying to make the whole car land upright and float in the water with the kid still in it. So that's what they thought was going to happen. So sorry your logic is too advanced to understand their stupid plan."

The man was obviously one of the last to exit the train, and it looks to me like a large group of people was entering the station at the same time. The lady is the asshole because all she had to do was wait 1 second for the man to exit, and then both turnstiles could operate as an entrance...but instead she made him back up so she could enter, and as a result he's stuck there until every other person behind the woman comes in.

PeopleBeingJerks,1ws8o3,matttebbetts,3,Mon Feb 3 03:59:40 2014 UTC,"HAHA! YES! I just did this with a buddy of mine and he actually didn't know who it was! Eventually he started doing the whole 'cancel' text replies but it never stopped hehe. I even went so far as to reset my voice mail to ""..Hello, you've reach Cat Facts Daily. To cancel your subscription, say 'cancel' after the tone."" Then my voicemail beep would beep and all you heard was the most carefully pronounced ""Cancel"" message ever! I told him it was me and he thought it was hilarious"
