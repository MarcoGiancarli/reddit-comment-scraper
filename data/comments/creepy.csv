People without that little voice would walk near edges and not think about it, and some of them would slip and fall off because they're being so complacent.  Then one crazy developed with that little call that tells him ""jump! jump! jump!"" which forced him to imagine the outcome of if he did jump: a bone crunching unpleasant death, which terrified him, and kept him away from the edge.  So most people walked close to the edge, and some of them died, whereas his ancestors thought about jumping when near the edge, and it scared the bajeezus out of them so they cowered away far from the edge, and tended to live.  So that little voice keeps us alive by telling us to jump, forcing us to imagine the messy result."

His methods have changed over the centuries to now include smart phones and digital images but his goal remains the same; the necrotising of human flesh for easy consumption and digestion.   In the past he used paintings to find his victims. They would be hung in museums and homes where he would choose victims who traveled alone so they might not be missed until it is too late.  Now he sends out images such as this to random numbers. He is now in your phone, biding his time. Your phone can no longer be trusted.  Now, it is incredibly important that you do not check this post with your 'phone'. Don't react or show any outward alarm. Go on about your day as normal.

creepy,3e0bgi,novojoego,71,Tue Jul 21 01:09:17 2015 UTC,"Be careful, for some reason people are overly sensitive when you refer their anime as ""cartoons""."
creepy,3e0bgi,Xaxxus,49,Tue Jul 21 01:39:50 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. A kid in my class back in high school got in trouble for reading Manga in class. The teacher told him to put his ""comic books"" away.  He lost his shit, said ""its not a fucking comic book you dip shit""."
creepy,3e0bgi,sfdoolmtyac,14,Tue Jul 21 06:10:35 2015 UTC,"There's anime for children, and anime for adults, just as there are childrens cartoons, and adult cartoons, same with comic books and manga.  Some people are just overly sensitive."
creepy,3e0bgi,Galiron,6,Tue Jul 21 07:22:57 2015 UTC,Those people are being retarded anime = cartoons. Source wife is Japanese Trigun = anime bugs bunny = anime. Remember anime is technically a shortened  form of the word animation.
creepy,3e0bgi,sfdoolmtyac,-11,Tue Jul 21 08:56:28 2015 UTC,"They remind me of the same type of people that are like, ""omg I hate English dubs, you have to watch it in the original Japanese language to really get the full experience""  Granted, sometimes the Japanese really is much better, or the English really is that bad, but for the most part, in my opinion, either way is fine."
creepy,3e0bgi,MrEhrmann,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:06:31 2015 UTC,"You should watch all films(anime, movies, tv shows, etc.) in the language it was originally released in. Dubs, more often than not, filter out alot of the intended plot and emotion of the original director/voice-actors.  The only exception I make are for documentaries. Only english-dubbed documentaries for me please."
creepy,3e0bgi,sfdoolmtyac,5,Tue Jul 21 10:47:39 2015 UTC,"While I see your point, you're also potentially undermining the effort and emotion that the voice actors / actresses put into the dubs.  I've seen a few that the English dubs were just emotionless and seemingly uncaring, but I've also seen many where they sound like they had fun, and put genuine effort and emotion into it. (Abenobashi comes to mind)  But I will admit that some things are difficult to translate over, or just get lost in translation entirely."
creepy,3e0bgi,Flugkrake,2,Tue Jul 21 11:03:02 2015 UTC,What about Japanese dragonball? How am I supposeed to watch that?
creepy,3e0bgi,irishmochi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:06:48 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, to watch it in the original, intended, language. Sadly, I usually watch either what's available, or which sounds better to me. (Like personally, I love the dub of FMA, but sub of Mushishi.)"
creepy,3e0bgi,sfdoolmtyac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:04:29 2015 UTC,"Judging by the score, many people seem to disagree with me.  I'd like to clarify, Japanese language is great, and when it comes as an option in video games, I'll try both languages to see which one I like best, I was merely talking about the people who disregard the English dubs as objectively worse, despite the effort that may have been put into the dubs.  I realise my last comment may have been a bit harsh and/or unclear, just wanted to clarify."

creepy,3e0bgi,Buttermilkman,-13,Tue Jul 21 09:41:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, Anime lover here, and it annoys me when people call my animu cartoons. Why? Because cartoons refer the caricature comedy sketches, either animated or comic form, such as The Dandy and Roger Rabbit. Anime has a much different style and much MUCH broader story and character types."

creepy,3e0bgi,bigbootyboss,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly sort of surprised they haven't gone this route. For some reason, AoT is a money-printing franchise; you'd think they'd take every opportunity to wring it out. Or maybe they're being smart this time and not wearing out their welcome too early."
creepy,3e0bgi,TrueTinFox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:22 2015 UTC,"You've gotta remember that most anime is marketing material. My understanding is actually airing a show typically isn't profitable - they're made to make money on blu-ray sales, collectable stuff, and the source material. The manga and it's spinoffs probably have a long lifespan left in them, so they don't want to blow their wad going anime-original (something that's been largely negatively viewed by fans anyways)."
creepy,3e0bgi,bigbootyboss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:33 2015 UTC,"So I've heard. I don't know how much interest Isayama has in dragging this out, from the few interviews I've seen, he seems like an Araki-type who just does his own thing.

creepy,3e0bgi,Neex,11,Tue Jul 21 11:25:24 2015 UTC,"I was at the premiere for the film here in LA. While the Titans were well done in the first scene we see them, either budget constraints of lack of effort made them pretty lackluster for the rest of the film. They went from interesting distorted figures to random people in skin suits.  The movie itself was pretty rough. They took weird departures from the series (no one had seen a Titan in 100 years, yet they all still lived within the walls), and they hardly advanced the story at all. The movie effectively ends with Eren discovering his ""ability"".  Also they made Mikasa a silent, distant character that was just a girlfriend of a weird version of Captain Levi. There goes a strong portrayal of women in film!"

I don't get the sense that Isayama cares that much about keeping the gravy train running, so he might just finish this and go on to another series, but it'd be neat. A monster you can't fight is much scarier. That's why the female variant arc was so good, it was scary as hell and just had this sort of realistic, hopeless feel to it.

creepy,3e0bgi,ArachnophobicSpider,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:18 2015 UTC,"I've got a few suggestions. Keep in mind that I am not fluent in Japanese, but these are my favorite resources that I've found in my ongoing studies.   Start with learning the kana writing systems, i.e. Hiragana (ひらがな) and Katakana (カタカナ).  Most introductory Japanese courses start with this, but in case you don't know which ones to use... Imabi is a pretty good all-inclusive course in Japanese.  The real kicker is that it's free! Human Japanese is my personal favorite for an introductory course, though I haven't tried their intermediate course.  It costs one payment of $18.95 (no monthly fee Rosetta Stone BS), and it's really quite fun to learn.  I found myself looking forward to each lesson. The next step would be teaching yourself about the more complex grammar.  Ignore this if you decide to work all the way through Imabi.  I recommend the 'Genki' introductory Japanese books, as well as Tae Kim's Grammar (this one is excellent and free!). The next big step is to learn Kanji.  I recommend Kanji Damage (read through that intro page) as my favorite method of learning Kanji.  Some people don't see any point in learning how Kanji work, and just prefer to memorize the symbols as they expand their vocabulary.  If you're one of those people, just study new vocabulary words every day for a long time. Finally, read.  Read untranslated manga, sound everything out to yourself, and understand what they're saying.  As the other guy said, it can take easily more than a year to get to this point.   Those are just a very small number of options, there are many more if these don't suit you.  The main thing is to stay motivated and study regularly.  がんばって！"

Now the actors just have to get that look of sheer terror and helplessness down and everything will feel right for me. I feel like whoever they choose as actors won't matter because it will just amount to really bad acting and it will be really cheesy.  It still might be really bad though...

creepy,3dy82x,CodeineCoder,39,Mon Jul 20 14:41:44 2015 UTC,"Lurker with an account here.  This post prompted me to sign in.  I have met this man. My father was in Phil's class at Logan and grew up near him. There is a human side to this story that never gets told. The man is absolutely brilliant. He would read textbooks right after receiving and have them memorized to the point where the whole class would quiz him from random pages and he would correctly answer every time.  I am particularly fond of how Phil correctly stated to the judge that presided over the circus that was this case that he was not ""daft"".  He is a social recluse and was bullied maliciously his whole life. He graduated college in 2 1/2 years but made nothing of his life partly due to his disgust of other people after being mistreated for so many years.  He was also molested by his father.   My father would give Phil rides whenever he saw him walking.  This is how I met him.  He is socially awkward but a good person.    Regarding the shots fired at his neighbor, I have been told by many on French Island that his only crime was missing. The family is notorious for being derelicts.  Phil is sad case of a brilliant person that society turned it's back on. No excuse for the crimes that he committed.  However, it is a classic story of a gifted person not fitting into contemporary society. Fuck those guy's who sell those bumper stickers."

creepy,3dy82x,Joe434,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:39 2015 UTC,"Sometimes a check is the only thing usable. Best example is renting an apartment because you'll need to write a large sum of money for a deposit, rent, broker fee, etc and it has to be put down immediately where a bank transfer would take too long (couple of days) and a credit card could be declined if the person doesn't have a high enough credit limit."
creepy,3dy82x,DarkestTimelineJeff,2,Mon Jul 20 20:29:17 2015 UTC,My local DMV only takes checks & money orders. I forget the exact reason why they don't take cash or credit card but vaguely recall that at the time when they made this policy it was the cheapest way to take payments since credit cards take a cut off of every transaction & for cash you have to pay someone armed & armored to transport it around all the time.
creepy,3dy82x,sg92i,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:27 2015 UTC,"I forget the exact reason why they don't take cash or credit card   Having a card scanner costs money to use it.  A lot of the government facilities in my town have them, but you have to pay the processing fee for them."

But for some reason I want to say I read it elsewhere as well, or maybe just similar events and I'm getting them confused. But there are other SS check casher killers out there. At least that part is true.  Edit: After fact checking (which, you know, my mother said I should always do before make outlandish claims, unless online), it turns out that Dorothea Puente is most famously known for renting rooms to elderly tenants and then killing them. Meanwhile, in another space and time, Robert Berdella is known for picking up vagrants and sexually torturing them until one man escaped in a dog collar. It seems that Cormac McCarthy conflated these two stories and put them in his book, No Country for Old Men. Then I, having read all above accounts, quoted that book as fact like a complete ass.

creepy,3e202v,corriganphoenix,11,Tue Jul 21 10:02:03 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to remember the author of a seriously fucked up book I read when I was a child. I was an avid reader when I was younger and would spend the majority of my days after school there. Being a fan of Stephen king meant constantly searching for an even scarier book. I was often prevented from taking out horror stories by some of the librarians, however there was one that did not give a single fuck. She recommended a book of short stories by (cannot remember the author) (?richard something?).  Long story cut short. The book turned out to have some seriously fucked up stories within its pages. The story that really got to me was about a young girl being bullied for having an imaginary friend. She was down the woods getting pushed around by a group of boys. The girl then watches the boys get violently murdered one by one. She starts to talk to what appears to be herself, but then the imaginary friend speaks up. Turns out it's an invisible guy. He then skins one of the boys as the girl watches with a smile on her face. The invisible friend climbs inside the skin and wears it like a costume. Cue erotic scene with invisible guy wearing dead skin and the young girl.   I was just turning 12 that year. That story fucked me up. Q"
creepy,3e202v,ImSoMoist,2,Tue Jul 21 10:34:53 2015 UTC,"I had a book which I think was called ""Road Stories"" or something to that effect.  I only remember one story from it, which I never finished. Never picked up the book after reading what I read to that point.   The story was about 4 guys who decide to rob a convenience store or something like that. There was more to the story, but what I remember is that there were people in the store that they put in a storage room. They decided to rape a girl who was wearing a hard rock shirt.   The description was ""They all picked a hole"" and started in, at the same time. One guy took the longest...he always took the longest.  She was dead by the time he finished.   4 guys....all took a hole....I...My mind cannot comprehend this. It's like some kind of error loop in my mind, I can't figure it out. I go to try to figure out how they all went about this at the same time, but then I disgust myself and have to stop.  I'm not sure I want to figure it out.  Its the one book EVER that I haven't been able to read. I also like Stephen King and can read just about anything horror related. I guess I found my limit."

creepy,3e202v,googlin,26,Tue Jul 21 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"Few years ago, I was into online dating. But it can be hard, truth be told. After numerous denials or dates that went nowhere, I started talking to this one girl. She seemed nice. Call her Jenn. Jenn, though, was different. She wasn't like the other girls I've seen. Tallish girl with curly brown hair. And her eyes seemed to stare through you. Right away she was very adamant about meeting up. She lived about 30 minutes away in a small country city out in the middle of nowhere. I was familiar with the area a little bit, yet as any other person might know, the boonies of Kansas can be a desolate and confusing place. Yet she wanted to meet up right away anyway and I thought id give online dating one last shot. So I planned to meet her that evening.   It was starting to become a dusky summer evening when I was driving to a local supermarket. I decided to get something quick to eat before I headed out to meet Jenn. And for the whole ride I couldn't stop thinking about her. Those eyes....they seemed surreal. Like dark, yet serene, gems. And her sudden immense interest in me. We haven't even meet yet and she was texting me like we've been dating for years. Strange, but my young heart desired to fall in love again.   I came to a stop at a red light a few miles away from the supermarket when I heard a truck revving it's engine next to me. Since I lived in the heart of the midwest, it wasn't uncommon to see guys with large supped up trucks doing stupid shit. But this guy was persistent. He matched my acceleration when the light turned green and kept at the same speed I was going, revving his engine continuously. ""What a douche"" I thought, while ignoring him. I never looked at him. I wasnt in the mood to challenge some truck loving hick. That was until he revved his engine up so loud it felt as if my car was vibrating. So I peered over at him.  And in that moment, a cold chill shot down my spine. It wasn't a guy driving this truck. It looked like some older lady with frail, long, jet black hair. But.....something was not right with her face. Something was not right at all. This lady looked like a burn victim with no teeth, mouth a little open, staring at me with black holes for eyes. I could not see her eyes at all, just shadows. I didnt understand it. Her skin looked messed up. Really thin and tightly stretched over her entire face, yet scarred. And she was leaning out her window, staring at me, dead on. That's what gets me the most. She was just leaning out and staring.... She had been staring at me this entire time trying to get me to look at her. I couldn't look away. I was in shock at what I was seeing. She continued to stare at me when I started slowing down at this red light. She blew through it and kept staring at me while she drove off into the distance.  A enormous feeling of dread and disturbance came over me. I tried to rationalize what in the fuck I just saw. I decided not to go to Jenns place that night because, quite frankly, I was scared. I didn't want to drive on dark country roads. That image of that skeleton burn victim lady was burned into my memory. My gut feeling just told me to stay home. So I did. Jenn wasn't to happy about that. She really started to get mean when I told her I wasn't going to meet her that night. I was a bit put off my that and decided not to go forward with meeting her at all, even though she tried apologizing for the next week. She seemed a bit crazy.   Two months later, a news station reported that Jenn and her boyfriend were arrested for  the kidnapping and murdering of a few different men around the area. Jenn lured guys from bars, clubs and even online websites to her boyfriends trailer. I was close to putting myself in a very bad situation that day. That will stick with me for the rest of my days. However, looking back on that weird situation with that black haired lady in the truck, I figured out why she was there, driving beside me that day. She didn't mean harm.   No  She warned me.   She taught me to never fear the reaper"

One day my brother and his friend ( lets call him X ) got adventurous and decided to check out the building.After school they go to the building and started messing around.X opened a window, through which they saw a perfecctly made bed which was all dusty.This spooked my brother and noped the fuck out.  X being the curious guy,continued to goof around.After a few minutes X came out running literally shaking from head to toe.He says to my brother he saw something move inside the house.Now they decided to get the fuck out of there.  The started to get on their bikes and out of nowhere comes an old dog with blood shot eyes. It was drooling and may be because it is old ,it was not fast ... it was sort of limping but not too slow.These guys were shitting their pants right now.But the dog was not aggressive.It just walked towards them.  The got on their bikes and rode the hell out of there.  Next day and three days after it X did not come to school.My brother got paranoid and went to his house.His mother said he is refusing to leave the room and has severe diarrhoea when ever she tried to bring him out.He told my brother what happened.  That dog had followed him.Till his house.And lingered around for 2 days."
creepy,3e202v,Iama_sapling,3,Tue Jul 21 12:20:07 2015 UTC,"Well, something that happened to me a few years ago i consider to be very creepy.  It was a holiday (Carnaval) and me and 4 of my friends have rented a house on the beach to stay for a few days. The house had 2 bedrooms, and me and 2 of my male friends stayed on one of them, and the girls stayed on the other one.  So, on the third day, early in the morning, i woke up and felt a shadowy figure standing right next to my bed. It was just standing there, doing nothing. I was still a little sleepy, so i thought it was just one of my friends who was about to do something to mock me, like throw water or something like that. So i just told it to ""fuck off"" and turned to other side and went back to sleep.   I woke up before everyone else (as usual) and i didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Later that day we were having breakfast, and i told them to not come disturb me again while i was sleeping. They looked confused and told me that nobody did anything like what i've described.  That's when i looked to one of my female friends. She was pale and looking directly at me, listening closely. I asked what was wrong, and she told me that, the day before of what happened to me, she was all by herself in the house (she went back from the beach to get her sunglasses or something like that, i can't remember) and as she was passing by the ""boy's room"", she saw something like a man, standing right next to bed that i was using. And just as she saw it, it disappeared.  That really creeped me out, and i asked her some questions about what happened, but she said it was all too fast and nothing really happened, just the vision.  Needless to say, i was really worried when i went to sleep that night, but the shadowy figure didn't appear again."

creepy,3e202v,HowTheyGetcha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:55 2015 UTC,"This happened to me. Not as creepy as it could have been if the outcome was different or there was no definite outcome, but still creepy. I posted it on /r/nosleep a couple years ago because I had just found the subreddit and didn't fully understand the 'everything is true' rule (part of me thought it was literal, the other part just thought that there was meant to be an even mix of true and fictional stories but they were all meant to be treated as true, but now it looks more like it's a purely fiction subreddit).  Years ago, I was watching a movie with my mother. Her youngest cat (Jagger, named after the one from the Rolling Stones, she kind of has a musical theme with her pet names these days) was lying on the loveseat, while I was in a chair and my mother was on the couch. I glanced over towards the cat, and I swear I saw a pale disembodied hand stroking him. I didn't think anything of it, because I was tired, almost falling asleep, so I thought it was just kind of a 'sleep-hallucination'/waking dream.  Fast-forward to a couple weeks later. I'm leaving my room, and I see movement out of the corner of my eye. I glance right, towards the movement and also towards my mother's bedroom where the cat is sleeping on the foot of her bed. I see a pale figure with dark hair and indistinct features, for a brief second, by the door. My mother not only was asleep at the time, but is blonde. This time I was wide awake, so it legitimately freaked me out.  A couple days later, we notice the cat is limping. My mother takes him to the vet, and we come to find out that he has an enlarged heart and some sort of a clot in his front left leg/paw. If we had waited much longer, he could have died. I still believe the strange things I saw those two nights were trying to warn us. Though someone in the /r/nosleep thread (which now seems to be missing, either because it broke the rules by specifically mentioning that it was a true story, or because of some sort of purge of older posts, I would assume) mentioned that it was possible that whatever I saw was responsible for the cat's health issues.  EDIT: I realize this doesn't exactly fit with the topic of the thread, but someone else posted a 'story that happened to me' type of post, so I figured I would do the same."

One of the older kids at the camp decided the darkest night of our trip was ""Ghost Story Night"". So, he told the story of Zeke the plumber.  See, Zeke, he was a Vietnam vet who...while overseas blew off his nose in a pretty horrible mine accident. Zeke was forced to wear a large bandage over his nose since...it was just a mass of damaged flesh.  Zeke came back to the state and, because no one would hire a disfigured freak, he got a job in a trade. That trade? Plumbing.  Man, Zeke, was great at his job and...because he really didn't have to worry about the nasty odors, he'd take any and all jobs.  Well, one day on a job, Zeke was working on a sewage tank. Zeke didn't realize that the dilapidated home he was working on had a gas leak going as he was working.  As Zeke flicked on his lighter to get a better look at some information off the sewage tank...BOOM! Zeke was blown to shit!  Now, some nights, if you don't pay attention...Zeke shows up in your bathroom and, takes his plunger and sucks out your brain!]  Man, when I heard that story...I didn't use the camp site latrine for the remainder of my trip!"

Good core concept, but I really thought the characters were completely hollow at best, the story that emerged from the core concept was poorly conceived, the path the characters trod made little to no sense, and there was never any sense of the protagonist doing much of anything worthwhile.  All in all, with the aesthetic style and the lack of substance, it really just screamed ""hipster horror"" the entire time I was watching it."

creepy,3dyxjd,Sylrein,2,Mon Jul 20 19:09:54 2015 UTC,"So I recently just watched this movie and while I'm a fan of horror movies. I really think that this movie wasn't all that great. I think it may have been the hype. But what makes it such a ""true classic horror"" movie?"
creepy,3dyxjd,ZetaScab,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:17 2015 UTC,"Well, in (almost) every other horror movie, there is usually a way to stop the antagonist(s). In this case, ""it"" is basically death. The director made it very clear throughout the movie that there really was no true way to stop this thing other than run as far as you can. The scariest part about this movie is the concept of not being able to stop death. However the Hollywoodized portrayal of death is this movie is the representation of mutilated human beings. Many of them appearing naked or in straight white clothes. This constant fear of not where but when is what makes the movie gut wrenching in my opinion.  Edit: apparently ""it"" is also suppose to represent a STD."

It lives primarily in the tissue below the dermis (with the microfilariae, basically worm-shaped eggs, living in blood and some other fluids so that they can more easily be picked up by flies), but sometimes it decides to come out and chill in the conjunctiva of the eye for awhile.  In some parts of Africa, as much as 70% of the population has Loa loa filariasis at any given point in time."

She's against a flat wall with holes in it through which the air is constantly being sucked out. If she was encased, it would be very dangerous because it doesn't take energy to keep air away from her and it could be difficult to get it to her. The device she's in is perfectly safe assuming someone is standing by and in worst case scenario, just yank the plug out of the wall causing a ton of air to immediately rush in"

What no one mentioned in this thread is the operators of the vacuum keep these sexy women in a state of suffocation for many seconds after they've turned blue in the face. Eventually the operator decides to open the seal and these women just lie there like lifeless barbie dolls, sometimes you can't even tell whether they're breathing. Slowly over time, you watch their lungers start to pump air, faintly at first until a minute later it's become stronger and you realize they haven't killed her. I'm pretty sure those girls consequently suffer minor brain cell loss each video they participate in."

creepy,3dvxoj,sotpmoke,3,Mon Jul 20 03:13:29 2015 UTC,This one door is not representative of all MBTA transportation.  I take a commuter rail and red line subway every day and think its pretty relaxing.
creepy,3dvxoj,veryConfusedIndeed,5,Mon Jul 20 08:51:19 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine. Just follow these rules:   Don't make eye contact or idle chit chatting with anyone. We think it's rude. Push your way onto the train unless there's an old lady or little kid involved. You let them on first (keep in mind rule #1). Then you try your best to push your way through the stream of bodies. Wear headphones so you can pretend you're ignoring everyone. Do not wear any logos from the following sports teams: Yankees, Lakers, NY Jets... And anything with Manning on the jersey.   You'll do fine."
creepy,3dvxoj,unolove,6,Mon Jul 20 03:34:52 2015 UTC,"We dont think its rude unless you're weird. Dont push anyone, ever, we're not new york. And you can wear whatever you want. This guy obviously isn't from boston."

creepy,3dvxoj,JaneOLantern,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:29:03 2015 UTC,"1 is wrong. Most people are just going from place to place and may not want to talk but lots of people are happy to have a brief conversation. Eye contact doesn't matter unless you like staring into someone's eyes. a little weird. :P  2 won't work since pushing in can leave you sandwiched in between the door and the next person. Not comfortable.   3 is a bad idea for a female since you want to keep your wits about you if you're worried. Wearing headphones is okay if you're feeling comfortable and almost everyone will live you alone regardless, but if you are truly scared (you shouldn't be though), keep them off.   4 is only a little true. People can be stupid but not always that stupid.   I'd worry more about when Red Sox games are because all the trains go insance around then. Get the schedule and plan accordingly."
creepy,3dvxoj,LicketySpliff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:14:06 2015 UTC,Seems like one of the first instances ever where me wanting to wear headphones and not talk to people will come in handy...doesn't sound so bad! I'm from the South where it's common to have chit chat with strangers and it always feels so fake and awkward.

Why does that thing look evil?  Is that a bowtie on the side of it's head or an ear?  What drugs was the person on who made this?

creepy,3dw18e,villzu,17,Mon Jul 20 07:55:41 2015 UTC,Seems like some don't realize how creepy this can be.  Being out in the woods like that and seeing things like this is way creepier in person.  When you're in a comfy chair or bed reading reddit it's hard to get the full effect.  I've done hammock camping out in the woods by myself and it's really unnerving sometimes.
