ftlgame,3e3bfr,chewbacca77,12,Tue Jul 21 17:24:51 2015 UTC,"For a starting Mantis ship, I'd sell it."
ftlgame,3e3bfr,Captain_Lord_Avalon,7,Tue Jul 21 19:26:10 2015 UTC,That's not a bad call...  I'd keep it around till I HAD to sell it though.
ftlgame,3e3bfr,chewbacca77,12,Tue Jul 21 19:27:09 2015 UTC,"I've gotten a fair number of Glaives, Vulcans, BLIIIs, and other high-power weapons in the starting sector myself. I've almost always ended up selling them though. High power weapons are great in theory, but when you're trying to bend over backwards to get that level 4 weapons, not upgrading shields, engines, or other essential systems, and even if you do succeed in leveling your weapons, having to wait that long 12-14 seconds to fire your first shot, you have a much greater chance of failure in the early game.   Not that I'm saying Glaives and Vulcans are bad weapons, however - if you have a strong late game build and chance upon a one of those you can use effectively with one or two backups (say, a BL2 or a Flak) you can fall back on, all power to you. But during early game, you'd be much better off selling the thing for those vital early game upgrades."
ftlgame,3e3bfr,MikeRaven11,9,Tue Jul 21 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"EXACTLY.  High-power weapons in the early game are a white elephant; you're more likely to cripple yourself trying to use them effectively than you are to win because of them.  On the other hand, an instant 60-scrap infusion when most enemies are only dropping 20 scrap can be a game winner if it means you can get more vital upgrades (like 2 shield bubbles, or L2 doors) a little earlier."
ftlgame,3e3bfr,Paradigmist,5,Tue Jul 21 18:49:05 2015 UTC,"Or you could just keep it and use it later, as though you never got it..."
ftlgame,3e3bfr,mr_easy_money,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. Hang onto it until you absolutely have to get rid of it or until you can feasibly use it. Develop other weapons, build your ship like normal, and then just when the time is right pop in that Vulcan."
ftlgame,3e3bfr,MTeson,13,Tue Jul 21 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"sweet, perfect item to sell straight away and get second shields up! Don't you even think about using this piece of crap, by the time it is useful.. wait, it's never useful.. just sell it :D"

ftlgame,3e3bfr,Paradigmist,3,Tue Jul 21 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like the only people who feel this way are the ones who got overexcited at getting their first Vulcan, tried to run it right away when they had like two shields and three engines, and got immediately destroyed. Some of my best runs were won with a Vulcan. If you have the defense to support it then it can handle the offense side literally by itself. Definitely not useful with OP's ship since he's probably going to board a lot, though."

Just teleport a firebomb into their medbay, wait a few seconds, and then drop in your rockmen. The medbay burns out and eventually all the enemy crew are left at low health with no way to stop the fire.   Add on a drone system and a couple defence drones and you can't lose."
ftlgame,3e1e2h,lost_in_blizzard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:32:44 2015 UTC,That's a great setup until you reach the flagship.  You'll need a bit more firepower for that.
ftlgame,3e1e2h,RoseOfSharonCassidy,5,Tue Jul 21 16:48:37 2015 UTC,"firebomb / teleport into weapon bays until they are offline in round 1, then use the firebomb technique on the medbay until all the crew are dead.  A Hacking unit can help speed this up this up.  Once the crew is dead, just take out the shields with more fire or your boarders, then any weapon can take out the ship.  Round 2 it's all about firebombing the drone system as quickly as possible, and then taking out weapons and shields.  the great thing about the firebomb is if the dude isn't in the weapon's bay, the fire will take out the weapon pretty quicky.  Round 3 is pretty much a repeat of round two, except you have to deal with mind control until you take out that system."
ftlgame,3e1e2h,lost_in_blizzard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:57 2015 UTC,"That takes soooo many missiles, it's really unfeasible in my opinion.  The Zoltan shield in round three makes it all but impossible.  How many firebombs does it take to break through the shield?"
ftlgame,3e1e2h,RoseOfSharonCassidy,3,Tue Jul 21 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"You don't actually need to firebomb and board the weapons, just one or the other, sound round 1 is 3-4.  I'm also hoping you kept all your rocks, you can can board with 4 on round 2, so that is only 2-3 more.  For round 3, you better have more weapons than just your firebomb, the Heave Pierce plus just about any other weapon should be able to take out the Zoltan shield not too long after the firebomb is charged, so 1-2.  That is 6-9 missiles, shouldn't be too hard."
ftlgame,3e1e2h,n_slash_a,6,Tue Jul 21 19:11:33 2015 UTC,"I love the Shivan because of Freespace.  An incredibly underrated space flight/combat simulator with an uncannily similar plot to Mass Effect, but from the late 90s.  The evil aliens are called the Shivans and fly scary looking ships with the same black and red color scheme.  I'd like to think FTL's is a reference, but it's highly unlikely.  EDIT: Okay, I may have underestimated the likelihood.  My thought was more that it could be a reference, but it's entirely possible that it is pure coincidence.  Maybe I underestimate how popular the series was too.  Just looking through this thread I see at least 2 other possible references the name could have been, and putting black and red together isn't that uncommon a color scheme.  Agreed though, it probably is a reference."

ftlgame,3e1e2h,UndersizedPotato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:48 2015 UTC,It's my favorite ship in the game but I  it's not a particularly strong starting ship.   Heavy Pierce is a good weapon but suffers the same problem that engi b has. Can't pierce 2 shields.   The starting 3 weapon power drives me crazy. It should of been 4. I know that a second shield bubble is generally the first upgrade. I'm torn because getting a 4th weapon power can help get early crew kills.   No vents and doors coupled with slow rockmen makes it really hard to defend against boarders. Even fires pose a threat. Getting a 5th crew member like an engi really solves a lot of problems.

If you're having trouble finding stores, make sure to plan a route that maximizes the number of nodes you fly adjacent to. Consider hiring a mercenary to scout the sector if you're in a real pickle."
ftlgame,3e14kz,Paradigmist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:20 2015 UTC,"That's a definite possibility, but also notice that the Flagship's Zoltan shield is still up; I know that I often enable autofire to take down supershields as quickly as possible.  That said, if OP actually does enable autofire at all times, that would certainly explain his trouble.  Firing in volleys is essential to overpowering ships and taking out their systems on the first strike.  Of course, without any supplemental systems (cloaking, teleporter, hacking, mind control, drone control), OP was pretty screwed from the start with that mediocre weapon loadout.  Even just one of the aforementioned systems could have made this a close win (I'm not saying it'd be easy, I'm saying it'd be possible).  Throw in the 119 scrap he's floating, on top of the unnecessary L3 piloting/sensors/doors (and IMO excessive L8 shields and L8 engines), and he certainly could have had the scrap to get the necessary systems or weapons he'd need to win."

Either you need to more completely explore sectors to find all the stores, or you're consistently getting unbelievably unlucky on every run.  Also, depending on how fast and loose you play with ship upgrades, it's possible to save up for a system purchase in sector 1/2.  Sometimes when the RNG is particularly kind, I get a chance to get cloaking in the very early game (instead of first-thing L2 shields)."

ftlgame,3dz5ps,51Gunner,5,Tue Jul 21 18:00:08 2015 UTC,"Just checked your pictures. Here are the major mistakes I saw:   Too much scrap. No excuse for not having at least level 2 shields (and maybe one or two more points in engines). You should make it a priority to have level 2 shields by at least sector 2. Nothing at the store costs more than 150 scrap so you rarely need to bank that much scrap in the early game. You are missing a lot of beacons (most notably in the shots from sectors 1 and 3). You should not rush to the flagship. To maximize your chance of winning, you need to collect as much scrap as possible before the flagship. At the end of every sector the rebels should be right on top of you (and in higher difficulties it is even smart sometimes to fight the rebel elite at the exit to get more beacons out of the sector).   Fix those, and easy will become a whole lot easier."

ftlgame,3dz5ps,njayhuang,3,Mon Jul 20 21:33:54 2015 UTC,You should not have 303 scrap and a level 1 shield.
ftlgame,3dz5ps,Pumpfest,3,Mon Jul 20 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"First thing I noticed was you left Sector 1 very early. Someone on this subreddit once said ""it's not a race to the flagship, it's a race to upgrade your ship."" General strategy is to stay in each sector as long as you can: you'll get more scrap and enemy ships will be easier. It looks like you could have gotten maybe 4 more encounters before the rebel fleet caught up to the exit in Sector 1. Couldn't see the map in the other sectors, but I would assume the same thing happened.  Second thing I noticed was that you never got your second shields. Lvl 2 Shields are the very first thing I upgrade in every run. Then I go for upgrading engines to protect against missiles. Don't underestimate how good upgrading your engines are.   Lvl 2 shields will last you a while: enemy ships will need to have 2 lasers to take down the shield, plus another laser or beam to deal damage. I usually hold off on upgrading to lvl 3 shields until the enemies start getting more weapons.   Third, you did well to think about saving scrap for shops, but imo you died with too much scrap. I usually keep 100 to 150 scrap early to midgame, maybe more near the end. A lot of that scrap could have gone towards upgrading your ship. I just want to point out that the ship that killed you is 100% useless against lvl 2 shields.  It's also a good idea to upgrade an unpowered slot on medbay and oxygen when you have extra scrap, so that they won't go completely dead with one hit of damage, and so that you can divert power to them when you need to quickly heal or oxygenate the ship. An extra oxygen level might have saved Scoops.  There aren't any videos of how you fight, so I'll just say that in general you want to time your weapons to hit at the same time. If they have missiles or sufficient firepower to break through my shields, my first volley is usually to weapons and then shields after.   I would have bought the ion blast on the first shop. The biggest thing ion blast lets you do is be independent of missiles, which is a huge cost saver. They also do double damage against Super Shields, which would also have been a big help. I would keep the Leto depowered, then power if I found a ship that absolutely needed missiles to take out shields or weapons quickly.  With the Fed Cruiser, you don't have to worry too much about buying expensive weapons. Lowering the cooldown of the Artillery is usually my main upgrade in terms of damage dealing: two upgrades lets it fire every 30 seconds, another upgrade lets it fire every 20 seconds. To put it in perspective, dual lasers fire in 10 seconds; a fully upgraded artillery will fire every other laser shot."
ftlgame,3dz5ps,dahkre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:39:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions! I'll be sure to try them out on my next run.
ftlgame,3dz5ps,BigBucksGentleman,2,Tue Jul 21 00:17:00 2015 UTC,"Based on your imgur album it looks like you didn't upgrade any systems at all. Not saving scrap is important, but you should at the very least be upgrading anything at all..."
ftlgame,3dz5ps,centerflag982,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:14 2015 UTC,"There could be a number of reasons you are feeling unprepared for the flagship. It's hard to know why without more detail about how you play, but here are some generic suggestions.  Take every opportunity to earn scrap. Always prioritize distress beacons and beacons with ships. Long range scanners are a great investment for earning more scrap if you can find them early in the game. Plan your route through each sector so you move adjacent to as many beacons as possible to find distress signals. Also, depending on the sector layout, you can explore beacons past the exit and then return after the rebels have advanced in order to get a couple extra events.  Make sure you are using your scrap wisely. Don't buy systems, weapons, or augments that are not a good fit for your ship. If you're  buying and then reselling later, you're losing out on a lot of scrap. Early in the game, you might be forced to take a purchase that isn't ideal, but by the later sectors you should feel comfortable with your setup. Also, make sure you are spending your scrap on purchases or upgrades that are effective. That glaive beam might sound impressive, but do you have the defenses to let it charge, and the other weapons needed for it to work against well-shielded enemies? Sometimes you need to up your defenses to avoid paying for repairs. Frequently, offense is your best defense since you can destroy a ship, or at least take down its weapons, before you take damage.  Finally, research strategies for fighting the flagship with different builds. You said that you are always unprepared, but maybe you just need to learn how to use what you have effectively.  Good luck!"

The constant change leads me to believe it might have someting to do with skills... or just some arbitrary number FTL doesn't make known to us.

They will appear post-teleport in the order they appear in the crew list, on the left side of the screen.  2 will appear in the target room, and 2 will appear in the ""next"" room on the ship, as denoted in the raw ship binary file.  The only way to change this order is to change the ordering of your crew list.  I remember someone talking about that a few months back but can't think of it now.  However, I would always try and board a 4-man room and just trap them in with you (ie: keep them away from the med bay rather than destroying the med bay).  Unless you are facing 6+ crew, that is probably faster than trying to take out a specific system."

ftlgame,3dulxj,CH33z8URgR,31,Sun Jul 19 18:54:00 2015 UTC,"it was Turing's first day on the job, he'd spent the past 3 months looking for a job to support his family after his father was abducted, and put to work, by the Federation; those damn bastards, he hated them almost as much as the rebel scum who were trying to oust them. It wasn't an honest job - piracy on a rock cruiser - but it was the only work he could find, and with 3 mouths at home to feed, he couldn't afford to be picky. The Captain, an aged rockman by the name of Ohm, was strict in his ruling but Turing was assured by his fellow crew that the man was a veteran pilot, flying in over 250 battles for the rock Militia before he abandoned them for personal gain.  The day had been going great, it was only midday and already they had taken down 3 engi ships and a tricky slug ship who had tried to scam them into forking over 45 scrap for nothing. If they kept up at this pace Turing would be able to afford rent for the next month, at least, as well as feed his brothers and his mother. They captured a rebel ship, bundling the surviving crew into cells in their storage bay, and all seemed to be going well until a mantis ship, adorned with the colours of the federation jumped into nearby space.  Ohm had sent a brief message out over the comms system and everybody made haste to their stations, Turing taking to the engine room where he had been taking lessons from a hardy rockman, whose name he had embarrassingly forgotten. He had done this several times now and Turing was getting used to the bumps and shaking that a battle promised, he'd even been sent to the medbay 2 times that day. Everything was normal, the ship shaking and shuddering, when suddenly a small bomb appeared on the floor of the engine room. Turing threw himself through the door into the life support room but his fellow crewmember was not so lucky and as the bomb detonated he heard horrifying screams that were cut short. He ran back in to find his instructor now lying deceased on the floor and sent a short message over the comms to Ohm before getting to work fixing the engine room. More shots struck the ship and Turing heard the sound of a beam hitting the exterior, what the hell were the shields even doing? He had just finished fixing up the engine room when he heard the beam again, but this time watched as it cut through the wall of the engine room setting the machinery alight. Turing sent another message over the comms to let Ohm know the engines were on fire and that he would need help to extinguish it, after all it is what all rockmen are good at. No response came back and Turing figured that the beam must have put the comms systems offline so he made his mind up and began running, at full speed, through the ship towards the bridge, dodging the occasional fire that popped up. Shortly after he left the engine room the shots stopped coming and Turing figured they must have destroyed the damn federation ship.  He stepped through the door to the bridge and watched on in horror as Captain Ohm fell to the ground at the mercy of two horrifying mantis'. He looked out the viewpoint to see the ship still there and watched as another beam tore through the ship, this time igniting the piloting systems. Turing retreated and began searching the ship for his fellow crew members but he shortly realised that they were all dead; succumbing either to the fire or the mantis'. He grabbed a fire extinguisher and made his way to the life support systems, maybe he could vent out all the rooms but as he reached the life supports he realised that it too had been set alight and, to no avail, attemped to extinguish the fire.   As the flames grew and pushed him to the corner of the room, Turing thought of his family; the mother he would never see again and his two brothers he had failied. He apologised to them aloud one last time and as he drew his final breath he thought of his father, and wondered if he'd meet him in the afterlife, if it existed.  The captain, at the helm of his mantis ship, watched as the last signs of life faded from the rock ship. He thought of the poor souls aboard the ship, and how they had just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He then thought about his family - he did that often. He'd left them to become a great starship captain, of course his wife - who hated how dangerous the job was - had told the kids he'd been abducted by the federation as she was too embarrassed to tell them that their father, a man whom they all respected, had became a soldier in the mindless war between the two factions of the galaxy. The captain frowned, but he soon began to smile when he thought of his eldest; Turing, and , unaware of the atrocity that had just occured, began to think about how proud his son would be when he finally returned."

ftlgame,3dvjfz,LucasTyph,10,Sun Jul 19 21:51:21 2015 UTC,"When people talk about ""Ship Tiers"" and such and which ships are the best there is usually an assumption there that is that the player is an experienced player that plays very well and knows the outcomes of events. This assumption alone means that boarding ships are very strong early on, because a player playing optimally wouldn't lose his boarding party because he makes a stupid mistake. It's one of the things that puts Mantis B at one of the top spots of many Tier lists, and for good reason. (The strongest ship is Crystal B anyways. The only other ship where I could see that one might be able to make an argument that it's stronger is the Lanius B)  So yes, FTL is very RNG heavy, but losing a run pretty much always is in some way the players fault for doing something wrong (there are rare exceptions). Skill in FTL basically comes down to knowledge of the game, the mechanics and some tricks (unless you speedrun it, or do a no pause run). Since you can pause at any moment you of course always have the opportunity to look stuff up. What does this event do? What are the rewards? What is this weapon on the enemy ship? How can I beat the flagship without weapons? How can I use a Pre Igniter to start every fight with fully charged charge weapons?  The question ""how to avoid these enemies with these ships"" has different answers for every ship. It's mostly an early game question, after that you'll need to look at your ship at every step and think what is it's biggest weakness right now and how you can best offset it.  There are tons of ways to beat the flagship. You don't need weapons or offensive drones and can just win with one crewmember. You don't need shields or cloaking and can just win with high firepower (a run like that by me is still on the frontpage right now). It's all a question of what you actually have when you start the fight. You don't even need skill with some loadouts."
ftlgame,3dvjfz,Eirh,3,Sun Jul 19 23:18:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think my next goal will be to understand the weaknesses of the ships I'm not particularly familiar with (namely the ones hat need boarding, I'm just really bad at it).  Also, you're the guy who had also made the 'AFK' and 'No Weapons, One Crewmember' runs? Damn son, you're really good at this. Maybe one day I'll get close to that by winning with all ships on hard mode :p"
ftlgame,3dvjfz,Eirh,3,Mon Jul 20 01:26:51 2015 UTC,"I did both of those, but the AFK thing was pretty much me having a good loadout at the flagship and wanting to try something dumb and the ""No Weapons One Crewmember"" thing was a run on easy where I planned a lot of what I'd exactly need to make it possible. With the exception of phase 3 there wasn't that much skill at the actual flagship fight involved. I just like doing challenge runs that involve me having to get more or less pretty specific loadouts I guess."

For anyone else wondering, search ""Sven Maneuver"" in youtube."
ftlgame,3dvjfz,Bloody_Lemon,14,Mon Jul 20 12:28:58 2015 UTC,"""And every single run is winnable"" is simply not true. Your arch-nemesis ship may appear as the first jump and you will simply die if you also manage to get unlucky. For every other ship there is also 1st sector Rebel Disruptor with 2 weapons, Med Bay, a combat drone and Hacking."
ftlgame,3dvjfz,51Gunner,4,Sun Jul 19 23:03:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed wholeheartedly. A good player can mitigate risks, a good ship has fewer weaknesses, and an experienced player might salvage a situation a weaker player thought lost... but there are just some situations you don't walk away from.  It's especially bad in the earliest sectors where the player's engines/helm are weak and can be disabled with a single unlucky shot, which prevents a player from dodging further hits or retreating from the fight."
ftlgame,3dvjfz,Leylite,3,Mon Jul 20 03:42:57 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point. Even though I don't remember seeing situations like that, there are always possibilities that stuff like that will happen. I could see something like a Stealth B run starting against a ship with a couple of drones that, even after the cloak, keep firing on the weapons and piloting, making sure you can't run away or fight back. I'll edit the original text."
ftlgame,3dvjfz,Leylite,3,Mon Jul 20 01:07:34 2015 UTC,"I've only ever seen Rebel Riggers/Disruptors and Auto-Assaults have a maximum of 3 drone power in the first sector, meaning that they'll only ever field one ""shoot at your ship"" drone. (I guess it's possible you could see one with 4, but I've never seen it happen. Maybe a developer can confirm there's something in the code to prevent that?)  That said, something like a Rebel Rigger with two Heavy Lasers and a beam drone is totally possible. Most of the time, that's not what you'll see, but it's possible..."
ftlgame,3dvjfz,Bloody_Lemon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:43 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing a ship with a beam and a combat drone in the very beginning of the game in that last run of mine, but maybe it was on the second sector. I'm not entirely sure.  Still, a bit of bad luck against this ship with the Stealth B in the first jump could prove to be deadly no matter what."
ftlgame,3dvjfz,Paradigmist,4,Mon Jul 20 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"Haha, this guy isn't satisfied with having all that offensive loadout in sector 1, he has hacking and event-lowered the player's engine level too. That said I think it'd be worse if he hacked weapons than piloting, but it's still awful.  On top of that I see two Engi there to repair any damage or single fires super-quick.  What a jerk.  All that said, though, most of the time you don't run into people like this on the first jump; often it's just someone with basic equipment like a Basic Laser + mini beam or Burst I + Leto missile, that's just a routine battle. So the ""winnability"" of such games, where you get some reasonable fights before running into the arch-nemesis ship, is very high.  Part of what makes Hard Mode so much harder than Normal or Easy modes is starting with 0 scrap. That means you get about one or two more fights before you have 20 scrap and can buy shields 1.5 (or some other kind of buffering upgrade)."
ftlgame,3dvjfz,Billykirby,2,Mon Jul 20 02:29:50 2015 UTC,One of these days I lost Mantis A to a Zoltan ship near a red giant as a 3rd jump. And by lost mean entering the fight with 30 Hull and leaving with 0.

Very interesting run, with tons of luck for me. I think I'm later going to make an imgur album and post it seperately for the people interested in it."

ftlgame,3dtca7,Ray661,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"No I don't. I really rarely play FTL at this point anyway, but tried to get a new ""No Shields, No Engines"" run going again, just for the fun of it. I got insanely lucky with some drops.  I don't think me streaming FTL would be that interesting. Most times when I do a challenge run, I have to restart often because the challenges that I actually try usually need some pretty specific items. This one for example needs a really early Pre Igniter and you know how rare those can be, especially when you need to have gathered enough scrap to actually get them on hard."

Honestly, with the rest of the FTL streamers, all they do is converse with chat and that's all they need to do to keep the viewers entertained. However if you rarely even play FTL then I can understand not streaming it. Regardless, it would've been cool to actually see the full run on stream or video instead of just imgur pics, as the journey to the Flagship is probably even more impressive."

That drone surge is a frigging nightmare even with an anti-combat drone.  My general strategy was to target the missile launcher with my ions while the drones did their thing, and also cloaking/mind-controlling when necessary. My biggest problem was easily power consumption. Powering all of the drones and ions alone costed me either 12 or 14 power, depending on which drones I had taken out of cargo. An upgraded backup battery (or just managing my power a bit more intelligently) would have helped significantly, but... whatever. I still won. ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

I don't think I'd have that kind of patience even if the enemy ship was unable to hurt me."
ftlgame,3dw5y2,Dude579,7,Mon Jul 20 01:06:39 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you just got confused as to which quest beacon you were going to - maybe you got a quest in sector 3 that got ""pushed"" to sector 4 due to rebel advancement, and then the ""drone delivery quest"" got pushed to sector 5 when you got it, so you went to this ""save the Federation base"" quest instead?  The ""friendly ASB"" animation is a bit weird, since it will say ""locked on"", flash a warning, shoot the shot near your ship... and then it arcs around and comes onto the enemy screen and hits them (if it hits; they might dodge).  The reason the enemy ship was so OP was that it was a Rebel Elite fighter, the kind you normally see in rebel fleet beacons.

ftlgame,3dt1hh,stinkypete234,10,Sun Jul 19 06:46:24 2015 UTC,"I picked this game up yesterday on iOS after hearing one of my friends talk about it. I heard people describe it as very difficult, but I managed to win on my first try.  I don't know if I was just really lucky or something.  This was all on easy. My friend claimed it was still really hard on easy but after this I'm pretty sure he was just exaggerating.  In the first or second sector I upgraded my shields to level two. Soon afterwards I bought another one of those starting lasers that shoots three shots. It was pretty sweet since I could kill lots of enemies really quickly, but I was annoyed at how many of my shots kept missing, yet enemy shots would constantly hit me. I figured since enemy ships seemed use the same systems and weapons I do(I assume) the engines(which I had neglected until now) were probably actually useful. I upgraded them a bit, and that helped a ton.  In the next few sectors I managed to get a cool laser. It fired three shots like the other ones I had, but it took longer to charge and cost more power - but it also did double damage to empty rooms. Sweet!  Sadly, I was taking lots of damage from enemy ships - the new laser took a while to charge, and I learned early on to fire in volleys to penetrate shields. But still, I was able to destroy enemies pretty easily and I was saving up quite a bit of money. I found a shop selling an(expensive) item which made it so my weapons were charged the second I jumped into a new area. Using my aforementioned money I bought it. It seemed pretty meh at first...  Ooh boy, was I wrong.  I was able to melt through enemy ships the second I got into an area. At the same shop I bought this laser that fired one shot and charged quickly(I had saved up, like 350 bucks in cash. Thinking back, that's probably why I took so much damage early on), and with it I fired ten shots in each volley. The few enemies who could still survive afterwards were too crippled to do anything except wait for their inevitable death.  I burned a path to the final sector, making sure to upgrade my defenses too. I was happy as hell when I finally got to the end. I couldn't wait to rub it in my friends face that I had won on my first try-!  Wait, there's a boss? Shit.  I jumped in to the area he was sitting in and was pretty damn confused. Four weapon rooms? Which one do I shoot? After waiting for it to stop cloaking I decided to go for the tried-and-tested route of shooting it's shields.  As a result I took a startling amount of damage from its weapon that fired missiles, but I destroyed it before it could do more damage than a third of my health bar. Whoo! Wait, I have to fight it again?  For the next round I made sure to destroy its weapons but was caught by surprise at its drone, which cut up even my best fighting mantis(rip in piece william ;_;). Besides losing one crew member though, I got by pretty well. The boss couldn't actually do any damage to me with its weapons so I just focused fire on its drone room and other systems like shields.  The third round took me by surprise. I expected to get rid of most of the weapons right as I got in but the shield took two volleys to take down, and I ended up with my health in the red. But after I whittled down the shield it was pretty straightforward.  All in all, it was great fun. I even got the ""technophobia"" achievement.  I also unlocked a ship when I got to one of the sectors so I'm looking forward to using that."
ftlgame,3dt1hh,Leylite,11,Sun Jul 19 04:26:34 2015 UTC,"Nice job!  Most runs you won't be lucky enough to find weapons that can cut enemy ships up quite that badly, but you still had a great handle on proper weapons volleying, damage mitigation and repair tactics, and overall upgrade strategy.  Now that you know what to expect in the late game and at the final boss, you should have no problem winning again! The other ships and tougher difficulties should give you some fresh challenges too..."
ftlgame,3dt1hh,Anistuffs,4,Sun Jul 19 04:35:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I realize I was really lucky this game. I made quite a few errors(not upgrading engines until later in the game, neglecting shields/engines in favor of more weapons, saving money instead of spending it) that I feel like I only really managed to get past through lucky situations. Without the awesome weapon loadout I had I feel like I would get my ass kicked trying again."

Combined with double BL2 is actually a winning combo then and there :)   and I learned early on to fire in volleys to penetrate shields.   Protip: Turn off autofire and fire when you want to :)   I found a shop selling an(expensive) item which made it so my weapons were charged the second I jumped into a new area.   Weapons pre-igniter. The best augment in the game. You will learn to love it. Pre-igniter+double BL2+hull laser 2 = victory. No arguments exist.

This win was particularly fun because I had never relied so heavily on boarding before. The Lanius are absolute monsters. I won many fights just by hacking the oxygen room and waiting the defenders to die by asphyxiation.

ftlgame,3dq5hd,thmsbsh,5,Sat Jul 18 10:43:40 2015 UTC,"Congrats! I'm curious about how this played out. You don't have enough ion for it to accumulate, but enough that you can probably keep 1 shield bubble ionized nearly full-time. With as large as the flagship is, the combat drones are going to be firing a little on the slow side, so they can probably bring down the other 3 shield bubbles but rarely if ever actually damage the hull. That leaves your dual lasers and heavy laser to do most of the work. Was that how you did it, by timing your lasers to strike while the drones kept the shields down?"
ftlgame,3dq5hd,AdamAnderson320,3,Sat Jul 18 20:28:06 2015 UTC,"The 3 drones fire faster than the flagship shields can recharge, especially if the shield has a bit ion damage (which means that it can't be manned). 3 Drones is actually ridicilously powerfull against the flagship by itself and I'm pretty sure you could win without any other weapon or shield hacking if your defense is good enough."

In fact, I don't think you can even fix a breach with a weapon. Rest sound interesting. Not really sure what your problem with one power weapons is, though...  About the first one; stunning is a little different than ion or normal damage, so I wouldn't really say 4 seconds are better. It's more about what you use it for, and just 2 normal stunners (for 2 power) can keep a room permanently down (both ion and crew wise) - awesome with lanius boarding the shield room. I'm not complaining about design, though, just saying.  Ion beams do, indeed, seem very OP."
ftlgame,3dsjtb,mekloz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:16:01 2015 UTC,ok how about for the ion stunner 2 it gets faster projectiles(like the heavy ion) the stun time is back to 5 seconds and the reload is changed to 8 seconds?
ftlgame,3dsjtb,mekloz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:49:34 2015 UTC,"I guess? I mean, you're still paying twice as much power for a very similar thing. Faster projectiles don't really do that much, especially for chaining weapons. Maybe actually make it a chain gun or something? It could eventually keep a room down, but it would take time. Or just change the scope even further: higher cooldown, higher stun. I don't really know, I just know I probably wouldn't shell out the power if it didn't actually do something really beneficial."

It's only 100 scrap, and is a lot better than level three in mind control and cloaking (which I'm guessing is your other system) or backup battery.  Also, keep your cloak at 1 power for flagship phases 2 and 3.  Its 5 second cloak time allows you to cloak multiple power surges in a row."

Your first victory is always your greatest moment, and then you post here then feel terrible as all the things you did wrong are pointed out. Following that statement, from what I can see there's some stuff I would have done very differently though.  Since you used a glaive beam build (From what I can see), your shields are the most important system for it. The way you set yourself up, you have 2/4 bars of shields. As you likely saw, the glaive beam has a really long charge time. Most ships can get 1-2 volleys shot before the beam is charged. If the AI has a moment a brilliance, then it can take out your weapons system before you can tear them apart. Level 4 shields are optimal, but if you don't have 280 scrap to spend on raising it up, level 3 shields are semi-doable for 100 scrap. I would not recommend buying a drone control system with the glaive beam unless you don't have shield breaking weapons or scrap to spare. If possible, your zoltan should be in your engines room, not in your shields. If you need to pull your zoltan out of the room for healing or repairs, you risk loosing a bar of shields briefly, which could be a death sentence with only 2 bars of shields. Also, this isn't terrible important, but I recommend not giving the med bay it's own bar of power. I recommend pulling energy from the engines or oxygen when needed to save yourself 25-35 scrap.  Sorry if I seemed to be rude or critical.. Winning your first game is the start of a lot more deaths, followed by the slightly more frequent victories."

People say this game is skill based but hard, no Demon's Souls and Dark Souls I/II are skill based, but hard as shit.  This is random.  Skill just alleviates YOUR mistakes, it doesn't stop the game from straight up fucking you with nothing you can do about it.  Difficult games like Ninja Gaiden (I've played the NES ones but I'm talking about the Xbox version) and the Souls games I mentioned, are challenging but rote, you can get better at them and eventually have nearly flawless runs.

ftlgame,3dr82e,Thehoodedteddy13,2,Sun Jul 19 22:13:16 2015 UTC,"It stinks when stores never sell weapons, but there's often other ways of getting a better offense.  Were stores also never selling hacking? Never selling mind control to help all your lasers or missiles land? Never selling a combat drone? Never selling a teleporter?  There also weren't any quests around that could have yielded a weapon (this includes letting the Mantis Ship Collectors escape, which isn't intuitive)?  http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/Mantis_Ship-Collectors  Usually there's at least some way of getting an offense going. The Kestrel A can hold out for a while with just its Burst II and Artemis (particularly when you have a Defense Drone I like you have here), but I agree it is pretty lousy when you just can't find a new weapon, not even an Ion Blast or rubber-band gun.  Plus, even if you completely fall behind the enemy shields curve, you can always just keep jumping, running away from fights if necessary, go look for non-combat events or quests that can let you get scrap or weapons without fighting ships, and hopefully get back on track at the next store or weapon drop.  I agree that runs have hugely differing qualities. Some runs will shower you with easy opponents, free scrap and a smorgasboard of weapons, whereas others will be a dry desert. It's skill that keeps you from getting completely flattened by the dry desert scenario, merely somewhat crumpled."

ftlgame,3dqjot,Markodavo,6,Sat Jul 18 14:07:51 2015 UTC,First I'd say you need to make sure you are maximizing your jumps in each sector. Plan a route that will take you through the most jumps possible before the rebels reach you. This will allow you to get more scrap than you would simply rushing through.   On easy you can get by on the flagship by having 3 shields and 45% evasion. Then you just need to work for a weapon system that can get through 3 shields to damage the ship.   Cloaking an help with dodging missiles and for the surges on the flagship.   What is causing you the most trouble in the game?
ftlgame,3dqjot,plafiff,2,Sat Jul 18 14:22:52 2015 UTC,"I think I need to stay in sectors for more jumps rather than rushing through because when I read all that you said I thought ""How the hell do you get enough scrap to get all of that?"""
ftlgame,3dqjot,plafiff,2,Sat Jul 18 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"Yah I rushed through sectors when I started playing and wasn't able to upgrade my ship enough. You should read ""FTL: A Practical Guide"". It really helped me a lot"
ftlgame,3dqjot,BepisChristmas,2,Sat Jul 18 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"That seems to be a common mistake new players make. Just remember that the Rebel fleet's pursuit does not carry over to sectors, so you're really just penalizing yourself when you leave a sector too early.  Every now and then the game generates terrible sectors that don't give you a lot of path options, but that's roguelikes for you. Otherwise just make as many jumps as you can and make sure you aren't visiting dead-end beacons."
ftlgame,3dqjot,cfiggis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:58:57 2015 UTC,"My first couple game, I misunderstood the setup. After reading the premise that I had this vital info to get to the fleet, I thought the goal was to get through as fast as possible. So yeah, when I ended up at the end, I was very underpowered.

ftlgame,3dqjot,SmartAlec105,2,Mon Jul 20 20:25:50 2015 UTC,"Also, I'd like to add that you should only use one level of cloaking in the 2nd and 3rd phases since if you do it too long, it won't recharge by the time the super weapon activates again."
ftlgame,3dqjot,SmartAlec105,6,Sat Jul 18 18:28:35 2015 UTC,Give us some screenshots of what your ship looks like before you face off against the Flagship. That will help us know if you are spending your scrap wisely.

ftlgame,3dqjot,Eirh,3,Sat Jul 18 15:51:35 2015 UTC,Pause often. Take your time.  Try to remember how your weapons look and what they do. Enemies use largely the same weapons and just fire them every time they come off cooldown. This allows you to predict what the enemy will do.  Getting additional systems on your ship is one of the best ways to spend your scrap. They are all useful.  Giant Alien Spiders are no joke (unless you have a blue option or a clone bay).

ftlgame,3dqjot,TheBetterYouFTL,2,Sun Jul 19 04:15:01 2015 UTC,I'd say what really helped me to start winning reliably is finding out which weapons are the most efficient as far as power drain vs. damage dealt. The Vulcan used to be my favorite weapon but it leaves you open for so long and if it gets knocked offline you're pretty much screwed. Burst laser II and flak I give you the best bang for your buck and if you have 4 flak I's and a or a pre-igniter the game plays itself.
ftlgame,3dqjot,smartass32,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"Just played a game with a pike beam, halberd beam, flak 1 and a leto missile. Shields dropped quickly and the hull damage was insane. Still got beat by the flagship though :("
ftlgame,3dqjot,YoungsterJoey99,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:17:14 2015 UTC,Never take a Leto to a flagship fight. I'd say the main problem with that loadout is that you're very reliant on the flak to down the shields for the beams to do their work. If you hit all three flak shots you're still dealing with one bar of shields so 1 damage on the halberd and nothing for the pike.
ftlgame,3dqjot,Leylite,2,Sun Jul 19 21:00:45 2015 UTC,Spacebar. A lot of spacebar.
ftlgame,3dqjot,YoungsterJoey99,2,Sat Jul 18 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"Maximise the amount of beacons you visit in each sector, you want to get as much scrap as you possibly can, especially on higher difficulties. As well as this remember to spend your scrap wisely, don't spend it all, make a plan of what you want to upgrade/buy and try to not stray too far from it. Another tip, do not be afraid to jump away from battles. Know when you're beaten, it can be much wiser to jump away after taking 2 or 3 damage rather than taking 10-15 damage but getting slme extra scrap. As well as these try and not become dependant on missile based weapons, you may find you have enough missiles on easy but as soon as you pick up a second missile weapon, or move up to normal, or even hard, missiles can be hard to come by and you should never become dependent on them Defense drone mk 1's are infinitely better than the mk 2 when it comes to fighting the flagship as mk 1's will only shoot down missiles. This is better as the mk 2 will also target lasers and ion blasts and the mk 2 often prioritises them over missiles and thus all 3 of the flagships missiles could end up hitting you as opposed to 1 or sometimes none of the missiles when using a mk 1 Remember your ABC's of FTL, if you have enough scrap then Always Buy Cloaking And one more thing that I cannot stress enough, yoh have never won FTL until the flagship is destroyed. You could have 3 flak cannons and a halbard beam and still get destroyed by a unlucky volley of missile strikes that take down your weapons, in the wise words of Han Solo ""Don't get cocky kid"""

It only requires two power so to my opinion it's on the level of burst laser 2.

It's only really good if you have a maxed out weapons guy so it fires faster than the ion dmg wears off of the enemy ship so you can take out more than 1 shield bubble and you will never deal damage wit it.

ftlgame,3dpfu6,smartass32,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:27:14 2015 UTC,"I'd say the only time a chain laser is comparable to a Burst Laser II is when you're running an ion-stacking setup and using the chain laser for damage once the shields are down. This is because in mid-to-late game it usually takes a while until the ion stack reaches enough depth for the shields to be down, long enough for the Chain Laser to spool up, but then once the shields are down the Chain Laser can fire on auto-fire, taking full advantage of its 7-second cooldown.  Obviously this still isn't ideal since you aren't doing damage until shields are down to 1 bubble, and only then 2 basic damage with small fire chance, but it's decent and better than a burst laser I or hull laser I in the same circumstances (but not as good as heavy laser I or II)."

It helps boarding or any weapons-based loadout.  And the exploit to get it past the defense drones just makes it even better.  The only time I'll ever buy Mind Control is if I have a slot for a subsystem in sector 7-8, and hacking isn't available or practical due to drone parts.  I almost never buy the backup battery.

Hacking weapons so you don't take damage while you're boarding (from enemy missiles for instance) Hacking doors to fight opponents one at a time (situational, almost no enemy ship has doors subsystem)   Basically hacking would allow you to micromanage your fight or make it easier (seriously hacking a medbay is pure gold), or it can help you disable the ship you're boarding to mitigate whatever damage you could take."
ftlgame,3dmq2b,Elr3d,9,Fri Jul 17 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"MC is fun to use, but it's nowhere near as effective as hacking. The single biggest advantage that Hacking provide for a boarding setup is the ability to lockdown room. This not only let you pick the enemy off one by one, but also quickly take out crucial systems on their ships like weapons with your boarders while at the same time hinder their ability to repair them. Plus, if the enemy have a medbay, then you can hack the medbay then kill them off when they go to heal themselves.    Hacking O2 is more of a poor man's tactic for crew victory. It's much less effective at killing off the enemy crew than other methods like boarding, and you need to be able to turtle. Still, if you are running a gunship and happen to find an enemy ship that can't hurt you, there's no reason not to use it."
ftlgame,3dmq2b,ChummyCommie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:10:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm... so let's say I had a ship that could effectively turtle. With using Hacking on O2 first would be to drop the Hacking drone then teleport into O2 room, damage the system, teleport out, hack the O2. Is that the steps to take to achieve victory with this hack the O2 strategy?"
ftlgame,3dmq2b,nitro67,3,Fri Jul 17 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"If you have boarding, then don't bother with the O2 and just pick the enemy crew off one by one. Otherwise, you need to make sure the enemy's O2 system is either completely broken or down to 1 bar. A lv2 oxygen system can refill the ship faster than you can drain it. There are two ways to achieve victory through O2 hacking, both also requires that you have some other way to disable their med or clone bay beside hacking:     If the enemy's oxygen is only lv1 and you have lv3 hacking, then 4 hacking cycle will kill them off completely unless they have a medbay or clonebay. Lv2 hacking may works, but it's much slower than lv3, and lv1 won't work. Else, you need to destroy the O2 once the hacking is complete, then wait for the enemy to repair it back to 1 bar, hack it then destroy it again. Repeat until enemy crew is dead or their ship is destroyed, whichever comes first. This method only requires lv1 hacking, but higher lv take less time and lower the chance of accidentally blowing up the enemy ship.   If this seems like too much trouble to you, then yes it is. That's why I said it's a poor man's suboptimal tactic for crew victory."

It's pretty weak,if the enemy ships have a 3 bar O2 and many late game ships do have that.  It can be fun, but there are generally better things to hack than O2."
ftlgame,3dmq2b,SmartAlec105,2,Fri Jul 17 16:30:44 2015 UTC,"Close, but you can only hack systems that aren't broken, so first you hack the O2 to rapidly deplete the oxygen, then you damage it with your weapons. Sending crew onto a ship you're depleting from oxygen is a bad idea unless you've got lanius who can keep the opposing crew from repairing it."
ftlgame,3dmq2b,adines,3,Fri Jul 17 16:31:12 2015 UTC,"Well the O2 hack is really cool, first you hack em, deplenish their O2, then you break the system, instant choke. but to be really effective you'd need to use it with 3 power, which is a bit much. And it costs a drone part, which you don't always have in high stock. But you can for instance hack the connecting room to the room in which you'll want to board, then teleport in, kill the crew in there without them being able to escape or for reinforcements to run in. Or when you're using Lanius boarders hack O2. Also, you could hack access to the medbay, then damage it, preventing them from running in. It really depends on what your style is and what the situation is."

ftlgame,3dmq2b,Leylite,5,Sat Jul 18 00:41:47 2015 UTC,"Defense drones shoot down incoming things like missiles, flak, and hacking drones by tracking their movement and aiming at where they will be rather than where they are. If you take the power out of a hacking drone while it is moving, it will stop moving. This allows you to wait for the drone to fire, stop the hacking drone to dodge the shot, and then put power back in resume moving to the target room. It can be a little tricky and doesn't always work depending on where the defense drone is and the hacking drone is coming from."
ftlgame,3dmq2b,Marionat0r,12,Sat Jul 18 02:55:16 2015 UTC,"It would be relatively cruel to call a system completely worthless, and such is the way with the systems in FTL. Everything can be incredibly useful, and I guess in what is going to be my biggest essay ever on FTL things to date, I'll go over each one in detail, in some scaling system of power.  It goes without saying that Hacking is completely broken in an offensive role because of the Hacking Power Exploit, or HPE. Completely and reliably draining all Shields from any enemy with total reliability for only 3 power leads to strikes that quite literally carry nuclear levels of force, with several combinations of beams and Hull Lasers capable of one-hit-killing every single enemy in the game. But even outside of this, the ability to hinder repairs innately, block movement and inflict all kinds of nuisance effects onto enemy systems at will is incomprehensibly powerful. Even the drone requirement is ultimately a non-issue if you keep your eyes on surrender offers when you fear running out.  Cloaking isn't that far behind, though. The capacity to evade any attack of your choice is incredible at increasing your longevity during any run, saving plenty of scrap in subverted damage repair costs and allowing the ability to safely take dives in any sector by cloaking the incoming Anti-Ship Battery fire. It also makes the most terrifying elements of the final battle a non-issue when timed correctly which can allow loadouts with rather lacklustre innate defenses the ability to easily complete runs.  Next.. despite not being able to purchase it, I would classify both Artillery systems for the Federation Cruisers, the beam and flak. Both are exceptional in their own ways, even if you need to get them completely upgraded to make them practical in battle. The Artillery Beam is a means of defeating every single ship in the game for only 4 power. The only thing that really comes close to this is probably the Chain Vulcan, and only if you know how to use it properly. With the beam taking care of enemies on your behalf, you really only need the means to remain alive. With AE finally conferring the ability to equip Cloaking on the Federation Cruisers as well as Hacking, the combination of Lv3 Cloaking and Weapons Hacking literally makes any enemy that isn't using multiple Combat drones /completely/ incapable of ever landing an attack on you.  The Flak Artillery isn't too far behind, either. It is essentially the Shields-dropping component of Hacking, minus the drone requirement. Again, with the means to completely wipe out all shields with incredible reliability, the opportunity to one-hit-kill anything you come across with the right weapons loadout is very much a thing.  Mind Control might not seem like much, but it also offers some very interesting means of cripping enemies while simultaneously saving your own hide. Being able to counter enemy Mind Control attempts is incredible for ships that are lacking in crew and is a godsend for those unaccustomed to the final battle. Being able to stun enemy Evasion by controlling the pilot just before your attacks connect is also extremely effective, although that does require Sensors/Slugs/LifeformScanner to work and it is ineffective against Slugs and auto-ships. My favourite trick with it though is Fire Control, where you use it alongside a means of igniting a room on the enemy ship to deny repairs for so long that the room is beyond repair. Another super-niche trick it can do is to be used alongside boarding parties or even Boarding drones to remotely eliminate enemy crews or even abduct random crew members to eliminate them on board your own ship. And who knew that you can actually control where Ion Intruder drones can trigger their pulse attack with a little Mind Control marking?  The Teleporter is still as amazing as ever, and despite the presence of Hacking and Mind Control and all those awkward pirate ship layouts, I would argue that boarding enemy ships is actually MORE EFFECTIVE than it was before AE. You know, when boarding was completely broken. Despite what was claimed, I ultimately feel that the rewards for crewculling enemy ships wasn't really nerfed much at all. Only the default enemy rewards were affected, I'm about 95% sure that the rewards for every single other non-standard fight are exactly the same as before. It takes a lot of skill to use and almost necessitates the use of Hacking or Mind Control, but being able to acquire those boosted rewards is incredible. The only problem is that the final boss is a bit more annoying to capture via boarding on Hard Mode, but even then it's not /that/ much harder, and by then you probably have a more conventional means of taking on the ship set up after seven and a half sectors of crazy rewards.  Drone Control, on the other hand, is about as useful as the drones that you come across, resulting in wildly varying levels of utility that can change from run to run. Defense drones are easily the best option for a defensive core, blocking Hacking attempts and saving plenty of scrap in missile damage repair costs. Internal drones can assist a weaker crew in effecting emergency repairs or dealing with boarding parties, ESPECIALLY Lanius ones. Combat drones are situationally useful, completely countered by Anti-Drones and are often very resource-hungry and dependant on your support weapons, but they carry the ability to end arguments very quickly (Combat II), reliably deplete super shields (Beam II) and even knock out Defense drones with some power trickery (Combat I+II). And of course there's everyone's favourite crutch in the Hull Repair drone, although whether that 85 scrap is better spent on actual defenses or not is a thing.  I don't really like the name Backup Battery, so I'll refer to it by its name in the 'kit, Emergency Power. It has utility in several scenarios. Since its power is only temporary, it shines in situations where you only need the power for a brief moment, such as triggering a Hacking pulse, Mind Control, Teleporter, Cloaking an attack or even a Combat drone or two once the enemy is exposed. It also offers exceptional utility in nebulae, where its power boost is completely unaffected by plasma storms, granting you a colossal power advantage that lasts long enough to turn the tables on your foe. One of my favourite uses for it though is when playing with Zoltan Cruisers, where you can use an upgraded EP unit to power up your Shields once the super shield is cracked. It made the Manpower achievement infinitely more manageable to attain, even on Hard Mode.  I'd cover the medical systems, but if I type up any more, my head might lock up or something. Let someone else discuss that."
ftlgame,3dmq2b,BepisChristmas,6,Fri Jul 17 16:17:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hacking is kind of ridiculously good. It really should be more expensive, or have lesser effects, or both.  It would be really good if all it did was do its hacking pulses, but the door lockdown and repair penalty on top of that serves as almost as good repair denial as Mind Control itself does - and denying the enemy's ability to repair their weapons is a big part of how you reduce incoming damage in this game.  Backup Battery is alright - I don't usually buy it in the middle of a game since it's important to buy actual system bars to both act as damage buffers and increase your ship's capabilities, but in sectors 5 to 7 I'll gladly pick it up so that at the end of the game I can break the usual reactor cap of 25 bars. (Plus it's another valid hacking target and potentially weapon target, so I care less if that gets hit or boarded compared to something like piloting, shields, or weapons.)"
ftlgame,3dmq2b,51Gunner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:14:32 2015 UTC,"I actually avoid backup battery because when it gets hacked, you lose extra bars of power. No always the biggest deal, but it can be crushing on a close battle."

I love doing this with Mantis ships. They never even get to fix the system. Mind control's also fun with fire weapons because it delays the crew controlling fires, allowing them to do huge long-term damage to systems and the crew itself. It's incredibly useful against the flagship too, both for thinning out the crew safely and canceling out the third phase's MC.  I still think hacking is the stronger system, but mind control is definitely the most fun to use."

Fucking hell.  Aside from that, I'd say Pulsar and Solar Flare is bad, because it disables systems on multiple fronts (fire damage, ion lockdown). I made a ship mod based around weaponized hazards, and the ion+fire combo proved to be very powerful (although my first draft of the mod was wayyyy OP).

ftlgame,3dnfq3,SerpentineCoils,7,Fri Jul 17 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"Normal isn't meant to be the cakewalk that Easy was; you actually do have to plan out things like your upgrade goals, sector paths, repairs, etc. It is true that a lot of things are viable on Easy that really aren't on Normal/Hard (Fire Beam, BL3, and Vulcan to name a few), but enough things still work on Normal that it isn't really all luck.  If you can't make it through sector 2 on normal there's no way you're playing optimally. No one will tell you that there's no luck involved in FTL, but the biggest factor in winning on Normal or Hard is your play. I'd say practice more, and if you still aren't having fun, either hone your skills on Easy or find an easier game."
ftlgame,3dnfq3,Anistuffs,6,Fri Jul 17 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"It's not a good game when it's luck, not skill, to get through even sector 1   Young man/lady, I can confidently say that I can win 99% of the time on Normal. That 1% is reserved for stealth ships against beam drones in sector 1, and even then, I've won many times. And I'm not even close to being as good in the game as some of the best of players here. People like u/Twinge or u/DiscordDraconequus (did I get that name right?) and many others here have repeatedly said that this game is more about skill than luck. They can win 99% of the time on hard.  There is very very very very very little randomness in this game you cannot defeat/persevere using skill. So, don't claim that you know how this game works unless you got hundreds and hundreds of hours of experience. Savvy!"
ftlgame,3dnfq3,DiscordDraconequus,3,Sat Jul 18 01:51:16 2015 UTC,"Indeed you did!  /u/whiskeybent_txn, let me regale you with a story.  Once upon a time, a friend of a friend claimed that FTL was all luck.  They sincerely believed that it was the RNG and the RNG alone which determined whether or not you won.  I believed that to be false, and set out to prove him wrong.    I sat down, turned on Livestream, and streamed myself playing (and winning!) with 10 ships in a row on normal mode (hard mode wasn't released).  It took about 13 hours but I won with all 10 ships.  I was also doing shots of Fireball Whisky while doing the last ship.  Which was Engi B.  Which I won.  Now I suppose it is very possible that in this case it was just a good streak of luck.  This is a random game, and that randomness can help runs and hurt runs.  But the fact is that across many many games some players can consistently pull 90%+ win rates on Normal and Hard.  That's not a statistical anomaly.  You can be good enough to make the RNG not matter anymore.    I can almost promise you that if you streamed yourself playing (you could simply tell us your Steam name and somebody could spectate you) that skilled players could point out things to do to do better.  Hell, I consider myself good at the game and when I sit back and watch my own recordings I see tons of things I could have done to do better.  I annotated one of my pretty cool Hard victories once and I point out one or two mistakes that I did wrong."

I barely have ""a few"" hours to play with all the other stuff I got going on. It's good to hear that it requires a ton of practice, though, because I've been feeling that the game is random, or that I'm an idiot. I'll have a lot of nice things going on, and then I hit a solar flare, or a ship with fire beams, and they knock out my doors on the first shot, and even with 6 crew (which happened only once - dumb luck), I'm toast in about 20 seconds."
ftlgame,3dnfq3,gfixler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:14:42 2015 UTC,"Usually it's more like, you're doing well and the game throws you a solar flare WHILE fighting a ship with fire beams, AND your doors get knocked out on the first shot, and they probably board you or hack your O2 while they're at it. /s  There are random events like this that pretty much do turn out to be ""You just don't win this run, it's over."""

ftlgame,3dnfq3,Anistuffs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"It's pretty tough. Right after that comment, I went to play more, built up a good number of crew, new weapons, a drone thing (took 15 hours to finally enable drones), and then I hopped into a nebula, couldn't see most rooms, had the whole ship lit on fire within seconds of starting a fight, crew toward the front of the ship trying to repair doors so I could put out the fire meant they couldn't repair the O2 in time, and most died, save an Engi, who managed to get to and repair the O2 in an O2-free ship, while a human fixed the doors a half-second before dying, leaving the Engi alone, which let me close the doors, and send the Engi - who had just finished fixing the O2 - to the med bay, where he repaired it just as the oxygen went from striped-red to red, and just as he hit 1 pixel-width of life remaining, and so he was able to heal up, then go around fixing 6 broken rooms. Then he had to become the pilot. I got to the exit, jumped to the next sector, jumped to an empty place, then a store (no money), then another empty place(!), then a battle, where he died in seconds :(  More like FTG. Actually, I got 3 badges(?) on that one, my first 3, because he managed to jump into the 5th sector, which was a first for me. I can try out another ship now (not that I'm any good with the first one)."

I'm always sucked into things that are too difficult for me. That's why I'm spending most of my free time learning Haskell and functional programming. I keep picking up more as I play, like that I can pause and still do certain useful things, and that targeting the drone room is really helpful for those jerks that have 2 powerful drones, and that I can actually stop FTL jumps by taking out their engines. These weren't obvious for the first 15+ games. My current cycle is to play, get further, die stupidly, flip a table, leave, and then feel the game pull me back in later that day, or the next. I switched down to Easy, and I'm still dying a lot, though. Haven't made it through one full run of sectors yet."
ftlgame,3dnfq3,Leylite,2,Mon Jul 20 07:08:13 2015 UTC,"On easy, I never showed mercy to enemy ships, and I always picked the risky options on all events, because ""that's the way to maximize your potential income"". And if one of your crew dies, you just buy a new one.  On normal, you can not always do that. When the enemy offers surrender, it can sometimes be more beneficial to actually accept that offer, because a shorter fight also means you loose less resources. Same goes for other events where you just have to choose to take the safe option rather than the risky but more rewarding one. Giant enemy spiders in second sector? Hell no, the off-chance that one of my guys dies is not acceptable.  Just be more cautious, and you will see it becomes easier to win normal mode. The only games I fail on normal are because I make decisions that I should not have made. But I do that deliberately often times, because I too like to live dangerously."
ftlgame,3dnfq3,YoungsterJoey99,5,Sat Jul 18 10:40:37 2015 UTC,"To clarify: Your weapons aren't inherently less accurate on Normal mode, it's just that in later sectors enemies will tend to have greater engines (due to larger system budgets), and therefore will indeed tend to dodge your weapons more often.  What's worse is that on Hard mode, in sector 1 enemies will man their engines instead of their shields, meaning your weapons really are 5% less accurate per projectile. That said, in all difficulties auto-ships (the dodgiest ship class) are always manning their engines anyway, so it's less of a difference there.  So yes, Normal mode does require you to balance offense and defense carefully, because there are fewer ""sure thing"" battles where you just stomp the opponent."
ftlgame,3dnfq3,Leylite,5,Fri Jul 17 18:43:30 2015 UTC,"Not to sound like a judgemental dick but I think you need to just practice more. Normal is a bit of a punch in the gut at first, but as you probably know from when you first started, so was easy. It just takes a little more studying of situations, comparing statistics on weapons, pausing the game for a little longer to study what your enemies are doing to up your game. You need to also remember that you can't win every battle, sometimes it's much wiser to jump away rather than win but lose 10 hull points. But even though all of these things are important the main thing you need to watch is how you manage your scrap. Almost every game I win on easy I find I have maxed out engines, shields and weapons whilst i'm still on sector 7 whereas in normal i'll be lucky to have one or more of those things maxed out by the time I reach the flagship. You also have to refine your strategies to fit the weapons/systems/crew/ship you're using. You can't use the same strategy on the kestrel B as you can on the  Mantis B and expect to win because you did in the kestrel.  Also another tip, I see you had an artemis on your winning ship, it's usually a lot better to use non-missile based weapons as in late game they can be quite hard to find unless you're defeating every ship through boarding. It can be quite annoying to have a 2 or 3 power weapon sitting unused because you don't have missiles."
ftlgame,3dnfq3,Leylite,2,Fri Jul 17 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"Artemis Missile is a fine weapon to keep - it's a one power weapon that can be a good complement to a lot of loadouts, and in the lategame it can be good to just fire one or two at the weapons of powerful ships to help weaken them, or at the helm of a ship trying to run away.  Now, if they had 4 laser weapons to fill all of their weapon slots, then it might be worth considering swapping it out. But when they only have three weapons, it's definitely worth keeping."
ftlgame,3dnfq3,MysticScience,2,Sat Jul 18 00:45:27 2015 UTC,"I kept the Artemis because my primary attack was firing my Flak 1 and right as soon as shields were down, I'd fire my BL2.  I saved my missiles and used the Artemis in the late game to help take down higher power shields."

I wanted a challenge, so I was playing Rock A.. Sector one went something like this: Free Pike beam. Free FTL Recharge Booster (read: scrap). Double reward. Free Crew. Double Reward. Free Auto-Reloader. Free crew.  And in the beginning of sector 2: Free Pre-Igniter.  I was about 90% sure I'd win after the Pike beam.  I was about 99% sure I'd win by the end of sector 1.  And I was 100% sure I'd win after I found the Pre-Igniter.  Flak II with double Pike Beams, a Heavy Laser, a Pre-Igniter, and two Auto-Reloaders is really fun."
ftlgame,3dma6z,chewbacca77,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:08:25 2015 UTC,I don't often go with beams or heavy lasers unless I'm really hurting for some extra damage. 3 power for two shots doesn't seem worth it to me. Beams can do good damage but you still need to down their shields first for that to really matter. That flak II with pre-igniter though... Had a game with 4 flak I and a preigniter a few days ago.

He remembered everything so vividly, the whoosh of the teleporter as he had boarded the ships of his enemies, their blood curdling screams and the looks of triumph on his crew's face after they had successfully relieved a ship of it's crew. He had grown to become quite a legend around mantis controlled space, receiving praise for his actions in the war the mantis had won against the mysterious rockmen and eventually becoming the highest ranked starship captain in the entire Mantis militia. Kazaak took great pride in these memories as he, now absent-mindedly, looked out onto the large human standing above him. He remembered these creatures well - always eager to fight, and he also remembered slaughtering many of them in the great battles of the Rebellion. There was something else though, some memory - important he knew - that Kazaak could not recall, one that had led him to now be stuck in this infernal place being looked down upon by the very creatures that used to tremble in fear at the mention of his name.  Then it struck him. Kazaak rembered, he remembered how the flak cannons and missiles had torn his ship apart, he remembered teleporting aboard the enemy ship, with his first mate dying in his hands, as a last ditch effort to save himself, and his legacy. He remembered how he had fought valiently, taking down waves of humans and engi alike. But then he remembered. The terrible event that had taken place. A well placed bullet had pierced his chest, right where his heart sat within his body, and he had fell to the ground - his vision fading as his first mate took his final breath before him.  Could it be? Kazaak thought. Could all of it have been a dream? Had he constructed this wonderful universe where he, Kazaak, was a mighty warrior in order to escape the sad reality he had been confined to? Had he imagined it all as a comfort to himself; killing the very humans who had immprisoned him?  TL;DR But what if he is awake?"

ftlgame,3dmcnv,chewbacca77,3,Fri Jul 17 13:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, this happens a lot. Sectors are apparently generated once you choose the Exit beacon out of sector 1, and are done so independently of what your ship type is, what your crew are, how well you're doing, whether it's a Thursday with a harvest moon, etc.  Rock Homeworlds always spawn between sectors 5 and 7 inclusive."
ftlgame,3dljer,trollnoob3214,5,Fri Jul 17 06:30:21 2015 UTC,"Hull, faster and almost always does at least as much (if not more) damage than Pike. Heavy Laser 2. Aiming at empty rooms is counterintuitive when it's better to just disable the enemy's systems first and beams are better for doing hull damage anyway. Charge Ion 2. Cheaper and also breaks any amount of shields (though only with a golden gunner or an automated reloader). Small Bomb is generally the best, though if I'm low on missiles I'd rather have an Ion Bomb. Burst 2, only 2 seconds slower and the spread of Flak 1 does  matter when you're not aiming at 4 tile rooms. Clone Bay because it allows you to take most event options that'd otherwise potentially cost you crew. Aside from that perk I'm rather indifferent between the two, though if I'm boarding I'd rather have the Medbay because I don't like having my clonebay bombed/missiled when my crew is being cloned. LRS is one of the best augmentations (though obviously not as good as Zoltan Shield or Pre-Igniter). For just 30 scrap it helps you to avoid hazards and find enemies and valuable events (most notably the Zoltan Homeworlds quest), especially in nebulae where you'd otherwise hit a lot of empty beacons. Also gives you many good blue options.  I consider SRA a win-more item (on Hard) - if I have enough scrap to justfiy buying one instead of just spending that 50 scrap to improve my ship, I'd probably manage even without the extra scrap. I've never really used Distraction Buoys. I guess it does roughly the same as an SRA - an extra jump for some more scrap, though occasionally you don't get anything from the extra jump. Also costs 5 more scrap than SRA and doesn't provide a relevant blue option like SRA (it does give you one, but it's in a Crystal Sector), and the delay only applies at the start of every sector. Most likely the worst of the three."
ftlgame,3dljer,corvid_,5,Fri Jul 17 09:01:03 2015 UTC,"I agree on all accounts other than Clone Bay.  On level one, it unarguably has better events. But level two medbay has about the same if not more events, and its better in almost every other way."

Same power, same breach chance but the Heavy charge faster, deal more system damage and have better fire chance. 3 Charge Ion. Lower power requirement, can also break through 4 shield, can store charge to release in burst. 4 Small bomb. Fast cooldown, decent damage, low power requirement. 5 Flak I. Faster coodown and better shield buster. 6 Med. More blue options, more reliable healing. 7 Scrap Recovery Arm. You can never have enough scrap."
ftlgame,3dljer,ChummyCommie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:02:39 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer Burst Laser II over Flak I  Kinda stuck between Long Range Scanners and Scrap Recovery Arm because Recovery Arm gives more scrap, but Scanners give you more battles so... not really sure.  Everything else you've said I would agree with except in some cases a Clone Bay may be better than Med"
ftlgame,3dljer,mr_easy_money,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:34:39 2015 UTC,Long Range Scanners can easily give you more scrap in knowing where to go.  And you can completely avoid certain events like suns without a ship.

If you have a competent gunship, you can only go to the beacons that have ships.. You can completely avoid the sun event with no ship.. You can visit the ASB in Lanius sectors.. You can know if you can safely go in to nebula or if you need to upgrade your reactor first..  If used correctly, it can easily get you more scrap than buoys or a recovery arm."

You massively increase your chances of finding the homeworlds event if you only visit the type of beacon (ship/no ship) that it resides on..   Not every beacon with a ship means a fight. Likewise, not every beacon without a ship means no fighting or no rewards.    Obviously.  But on average, ship beacons yield more rewards than empty beacons.

Plus depending on the sector layout, this quest can be either hit or miss. Rock Homeworld: 2 beacons wasted for a single quest, and the reward is not really worth the effort. Mantis Homeworld: Requires dead crew victory, plus lv3 sensor or teleporter if you want more rewards, and lv2 medbay or clonebay to get Kazaaak. Slug Homeworld: You have to take Slug surrenders to even have a chance at getting this quest, and Slug surrenders are often worse than regular one. Plus, the quest itself requires either Slug crew or sensor lv2 and also strong enough armaments to stop enemy FTL. Rebel Homeworld: Depending on how well equipped you are, it can go either way. Zoltan Homeworld: The only one in the bunch that's actually worth the effort.    But on average, ship beacons yield more rewards than empty beacons.     Again, I'm not buying unless you got stats to prove it.     Just going from my experience here, but I stand by that statement.     Going from my own experience as well.

ftlgame,3dljer,ChummyCommie,3,Fri Jul 17 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"Homeworld quests are almost always worth the effort if you meet the requirements.. If you don't then whatever, but they usually have massive rewards.   But on average, ship beacons yield more rewards than empty beacons.    Again, I'm not buying unless you got stats to prove it.     Okay.. this one is should be very obvious to anyone. Empty beacons have something like a 20-30% chance of offering nothing at all.  Beacons with ships offer rewards almost every time.  At the very least, you would want to do this because if you rely on empty beacons, you're susceptible to the mercy of RNG.  If you go to occupied beacons, you essentially guarantee at least a scrap reward.  Your opinion on the Long Range Scanners is actually a bit surprising.. From everything I've encountered, its hands down the single best augment (other than the Pre-Igniter situationally).  And everything I've heard from the top players on this subreddit suggests the same."
ftlgame,3dljer,chewbacca77,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"I think both Engi and Rock repair your hull in addition to scrap, so they can be massively good late in the game.  Anyway, I'm on team LRS, but can't really give you any more exact stats either. I can tell you that SRA actually takes a very long time to pay for itself, since it rounds down and takes until about 6th sector to even start giving back on hard.  On the other hand, a single avoided empty beacon mid game (which is very common if you try jumping to non-ship nebula beacons, or just to avoid that sun) makes LRS pretty much worth it, and that's only one of it's uses."
ftlgame,3dljer,mekloz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"What's in the store, do I need it right now, and can I afford it right now?  Hull Beam (though I think I've used the Pike more). Probably neither, though Hull Laser II has more shots. Charge Ion. Ion Bomb, then Small. Burst Laser II, because I can aim it; but I don't mind Flak I. Whatever Bay I have - though Clone means you don't lose crew in some events. Long Range Scanners, because intel is important."
ftlgame,3dljer,Captain_Lord_Avalon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:21:54 2015 UTC,"Pike beam, because I like making the enemy run around the ship like idiots trying to fix everything, including the useless systems.  Neither, really. I like heavy more, but it requires having a good shield breaking already, and then I'd rather use a beam anyway. Hull will do better for more shots just to get some damage in.  Charge because of the power.  Again, I like the fire bomb, but you need stuff to make it work. Generally, ion bomb.  Burst.  Clone. They both work, but I like not losing crew on those events I just can't resist.  LRS. They give you actual advantage of more information instead of passively increasing your scrap count over time, are cheaper, have more blue events."
ftlgame,3dljer,mekloz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"Hull charges faster. Pike's slightly longer and the beam striking time is faster. Both are equally good. If I have both and can only use one of them, I'd pick pike. 3 power for 3 shots vs 3 power for 2 shots? No argument here, Hull Laser 2 rules. Again, 2 power for ion shot every 6 second plus the ability to fire 2 or 3 ion shots together vs 3 power for ion shot every 4 second is no argument. Charge ion rules. Lockdown bomb is useless. Stun bomb is useless because of the slow charge time. Small bomb is OP. Fire bomb is crazy good with rock boarding, crazy good with some dedicated sniping. Ion bomb is good if it hits. Repair bomb is useless. Heal bomb is useless except on the Slug B where you're forced to use it. Why not both? Seriously, Flak 1 + BL2 is an insane weapon combo. But despite how much I love flak and pick it up every time I see it in a store, every time I see a BL2 in a store, my knees get weak. Flak 1 still doesn't have that effect on my knees. Both are good. BOTH! There's no argument unless you're on easy mode where you can spare the scrap, which I don't play in. Distraction buoy feels useless; I've only used it once or twice when I got it as a drop. I don't think it's worth buying. LRS makes runs. There is no argument against this. Scrap rec arm is very good if you can pick it up before sector 5 at the most. After sector 5, it's no longer worth it IMHO."
ftlgame,3dljer,Anistuffs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"I've never actually used a Hull Beam, but I imagine it would be more useful since the way beams work sometimes makes hitting empty rooms necessary if you want to maximize the number of rooms hit.  IMHO the Hull Laser and Heavy Laser are both great. I'd opt for the Heavy because it can do more system damage unless there are two or more shields up.  IB2 is great because its base cooldown time is low enough to stack ion damage, but the Charge Ion can achieve the same effect with a fully-trained gunner and use less power.  Ion Bombs are a nice addition to any turtling loadout because they do huge ion damage. Unless your main weapons charge very slowly, you can pretty easily fire them twice before the ion damage wears off. Fire Bombs pair extremely well with Rockman boarders or mind control. Small bombs are a decent general-use weapon, and have a small chance to start fires. I generally sell any of the other ones if I get them.  Flak 1 and the BL2 might as well be in their own weapon tier by themselves because of how good and compatible with each other they are. Both have decently fast charge times, and both shoot three projectiles for ony two power, making them very efficient. The only significant difference is that Flak 1 excels at bringing down shields, while the BL2 is better at dealing damage to an unshielded ship. That said, any possible configuration of the two that uses up four weapon slots can unequivocally destroy almost any ship with little additional help.  A medbay is generally best to have if boarding is your main tactic, to make sure that your boarders always go in at full health. An upgraded medbay also gives you some unique blue options, which is nice. Otherwise I prefer a clone bay because it makes certain events that can kill crew members less risky (it doesn't effect some events at all, though, so be aware of those). I think there's a blue option for an upgraded clone bay that also gives you a free crew member. Finally, Reconstructive Teleport fully obviates a medbay for your boarders, so if you're using that then a clone bay is a better option too.  All of those augments are worth hanging on to, but I think Long Range Scanners are the most useful. Being able to know where you can fight ships and avoid hazards (especialy pulsars and plasma storms) is way more valuable than getting an extra jump or some extra scrap."
ftlgame,3dljer,BepisChristmas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"Hull beam - as others says, does basically the same if not more damage. Hull laser 2 unless I've got plenty of shield bursting power already.  Double damage to empty rooms is nice, but the high chance of hull breaches is golden.  Makes the damage you deal harder to repair. Charge ion - same reasons as everyone else.  Nearly as effective and smaller power requirement. I'm going to say none of those options and instead vote for Breach Bomb 2.  3 damage and nearly guaranteed hull Breach is going to ruin anyones day.  Fighting an auto scout with high evade?  Send one of these to the helm and it'll never dodge another shot again.  Prior to hacking this was my favorite way to deal with medbay and shields.  If I have to choose one of your options, then small bomb. Both are excellent, I'll take both please. Medbay is better for all non-boarding ships.  Allows you to gain skills faster and deal with borders better. Long-range scanners helps you find more rights and avoid ion storms, asteroids when you are vulnerable.  Easily the most economical upgrade in the game."
ftlgame,3dljer,Histidine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"1) Hull laser, by a hair. It's nice to draw lines across big empty sections of flagship and hurt it bad.   2) Heavy laser. Damn good breach chance, but also very good Fire chance and respectable Stun. The fire starter potential means it can do a lot more system/crew damage as well.   3) Charge ion by a landslide. IB2's marginally faster fire rate does not make up for costing the extra power and Charge Ion's ability to handle cloakers.   4) Small bomb. The rest are situational at best, extremely marginal at worst (repair, lockdown). Honourable mention to Ion Bomb.   5) burst 2 if I can find it. Flak is more likely to find more flak guns though. Close race.   6) Clone Bay, but not worth the scrap to switch. Giant Alien Spiders and similar become a risk-free roll, not a straight ""nope"".   7) Scanners for sure. Not only extra scrap from finding better events and avoiding empty beacons, but also lets you avoid outright negative events like sun+boarders. Nebulae can be more profitable rather than a host of empty beacons."

ftlgame,3diwpt,YoungsterJoey99,3,Sat Jul 18 22:35:19 2015 UTC,"It had been a long day for the slaver captain, first he had spent his morning shipping unruly mantis' from their homeworld to a mining operation at a rock owned mining facility and then on the way back he had been attacked by filthy rock pirates looking to steal some of his hard earned scrap. He'd spent 2 hours outrunning the thick-headed assailants before they finally gave up and targetted a nearby shop owner instead. Then his boss had decided to give him a very stern warning for being late back for a shipment of slaves, and to top it all of he had been stopped by rebels at a checkpoint and forced to pay a hefty bribe to let his ""luggage"" go unchecked.  Now though, his work day was over and the slaver captain had decided that we would go and sell some of the Lanius he had came across in the abandoned sector earlier that week. He'd made sure they were off the books, that nobody at the station knew about them, and had been making preparations to unload them at a nearby black market. But as he neared the beacon where the market was situated he noticed something, a large rebel task force had taken out the black market and were in a heated battle with several ships of different origins. The captain sighed and jumped to another beacon, today had really not been a good day. He was about to punch in the co-ordinates for home when suddenly a engi ship bearing the symbol of the federation jumped into the area. Excited at the sight of supposedly easy pickings the captain opened up comms and sent a message to the meagre looking ship.  ""Hand over one of your crew and the rest can go unharmed"" the captain said, with a sadistic grin on his face. He quickly instructed the few crew members on his ship to the teleporter so they could receive their new, what they hoped to be, engi. Almost suddenly a reply came through and the captain was shocked.   They had actually sent a crew member over, for the first time in his life the captain felt pleased with himself. All these years of holding up ships like this and they'd always reply with something like ""We'll never surrender one of our crew to slavers"" before firing off a volley of lasers that would harmlessly bounce off of the slaver's shields. It was always such a shame to have to kill the people that could have made such good slaves.  A small human boy had been beamed aboard, harmless and terrified, and was briefly walked down a corridor before being thrown into a holding cell. The captain watched from the bridge as the engi ship warped away, with one less crew member, and decided that despite all the terrible things that had happened that day, one terrified federation crew, willing to begrudgingly give up a human boy had made his day."

ftlgame,3dkbw1,nugyflex,5,Thu Jul 16 23:32:29 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty underrated ship, I think. First, it has Dual Lasers, which are the most power-efficient weapon in the game. The Anti-Bio Beam helps you get extra scrap from encounters early on. Breach I is another good 1 power weapon, and is a good supplement if you try and turn it into a straight-up gunship. After a few sectors, the weapons start to lose their punch, but... well, that happens with damn near every ship. Slug Repair Gel, if nothing else, is a free 30 scrap at the first store you visit.   The layout is decent for venting weapons and shields (less so engines), and I like that the medbay is right next to the O2 room."
ftlgame,3dkbw1,bughumbar,5,Thu Jul 16 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"Nope, most power efficient wep is mini beam, hands down."
ftlgame,3dkbw1,Roneitis,3,Fri Jul 17 06:07:47 2015 UTC,Nope. Most power efficient weapon is advanced flak.
ftlgame,3dkbw1,SmartAlec105,2,Fri Jul 17 13:12:49 2015 UTC,"If we are talkin pure damage/power, mini beam is better, because on, every ship bar a few drones, it can hit at least three rooms with positioning, sometimes four. In comparison, the the flak can do a maximum of three damage, and even on those drones, due to the small rooms, you have a very low chance of hitting three shots."
ftlgame,3dkbw1,Roneitis,2,Fri Jul 17 13:43:37 2015 UTC,"But your argument completely ignores other important factors. Even if you say Mini Beam deals 4 damage and completely ignore the shield damage Adv. Flak does, you also have to consider the recharge time. 3 damage every 8 seconds is just better than 4 damage every 12 seconds (it's 0.375 dps vs 0.33 dps)."
ftlgame,3dkbw1,Eirh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"True, but I was talking in pure terms of damage. If we account for ALL factors, we also need to think about misses, which are impossible for the mini-beam and terribly common for the flak. You are right about the flak being far more versatile, but when you have literally ANY other weapon for shield breaking, the mini beam's slightly longer charge is irrelevant, as the time is smaller than all other shield breakers (when you account for projectile time). And even with the advanced flak, you're gonna want to wait until all your other weapons are ready, because burst damage is something you need to think about."
ftlgame,3dkbw1,Roneitis,2,Sat Jul 18 04:48:03 2015 UTC,..if you have the weapons/systems to support it.
ftlgame,3dkbw1,chewbacca77,2,Fri Jul 17 12:38:56 2015 UTC,Fair 'nuff. I think the ability to pierce two shields with one power is a little more useful in the short term.  but then I forgot about Advanced Flak which would outdo the Dual Lasers in that department
ftlgame,3dkbw1,bughumbar,4,Fri Jul 17 15:27:10 2015 UTC,"Winning on your first run with it doesn't necessarily mean its better than the others, maybe you've improved a lot without noticing, maybe you've just been blessed by the RNG...  I have won with quite a few ships on my first run with them as well (namely, Stealth C, Rock B, Lanius B and maybe a few others). The Slug A, being kind of a ""standard"" ship (it doesn't require any unorthodox strategies), makes for a small challenge. Also, it's really underrated, as the Bio Beam can net you a crap ton of scrap in the early game, so building a gunship (which seems like the easiest and mos efficient way to build an end-game ship to me) gets fairly easier.  Also, it's a slug ship, and slugs are FTL's master race."
ftlgame,3dkbw1,LucasTyph,2,Fri Jul 17 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I believe I had ionblast 2 and pike beam and flak 2(maybe 1) with clocking. :p"

My first win, though, was with Kestrel B, and for that, Red Tail will forever have a special place in my heart. Though my absolute FAVORITE ship would have to be between Mantis B or Crystal B, because 4-man teleporter=OP. I like Mantis B for the drone system it starts off with, and Crystal B because, well, crystals."
ftlgame,3dkbw1,TheBetterYouFTL,2,Fri Jul 17 01:58:39 2015 UTC,Actually had a really good run with the slug a the other day. Ended up switching the beam for a charge ion in sector 8 since killing crew doesn't beat the flagship but besides that it's a very easy ship for getting extra scrap without the risk and investment of a boarding party.
ftlgame,3dkbw1,lpscharen,2,Fri Jul 17 08:06:44 2015 UTC,"My first time playing Engi B and my third time playing Rock A I won with each of them.

ftlgame,3dkbw1,Paradigmist,3,Sun Jul 19 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"Slug A is a solid ship, though I wouldn't classify it as ""OP"" (most notably, I'd rank it behind Crystal B, Lanius B, Mantis B, and Kestrel B).  For reference, here's my full tier list (order within a tier is largely meaningless):  S tier - Kestrel B, Mantis B, Crystal B, Lanius B  A tier - Kestrel C, Engi A, Zoltan B, Mantis C, Slug A, Rock C, Stealth A, Lanius A, Crystal A  B tier - Kestrel A, Engi C, Federation A, Zoltan A, Mantis A, Slug C, Rock B  C tier - Federation B, Federation C, Zoltan C, Stealth B, Stealth C  F tier - Engi B, Slug B, Rock A  And a rough guide for tier rankings:  S tier: Easy mode.  Relaxing, but not at all challenging.  A tier: Good ships with good loadouts, but not instant wins.  Good for practicing strategies.  B tier: Ships that will present a bumpy road, but don't go out of their way to deliberately handicap you.  C tier: My favorite tier, these ships pretty much come with handicaps.  Lots of challenge, lots of fun.  F tier: Ships that are so bad they aren't even fun to play, not even as a challenge.  Heavy RNG dependence leads to frustrating runs."

ftlgame,3dkbw1,chewbacca77,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:31 2015 UTC,That's really close to what I'd say.  I only have two mild surprises in that list.  Kestrel B is ranked a little higher than a couple others.  But I staunchly say that Stealth C is a bottom tier ship.  Its far too susceptible to RNG to be anything other than that in my book.
ftlgame,3dkbw1,Paradigmist,2,Fri Jul 17 12:44:21 2015 UTC,"I'm rather partial to Kestrel B, because its loadout is fantastic and it also has an excellent layout for venting. I'd consider it high-A tier or low-S tier, and I bumped it up to distinguish it from other ships I'd consider solid-but-not-fantastic. I definitely see where you're coming from, there's a decent amount of personal bias in this ranking.  I haven't played a ton of Stealth C (mostly just a couple wins on hard to check it off my list), and the runs I played were challenging but tended to go well. Since I didn't really want to beat my head out after playing, I didn't put it in F tier because I didn't find it unfun.  It's possible I was just fairly lucky on the runs I did have."
ftlgame,3dkbw1,YoungsterJoey99,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know, the starting loadout kf the kestrel B ensures you can win almost any fight without taking any damage for the first several sectors and by the time the weapons become inneffective you've upgraded them"
ftlgame,3dkbw1,chewbacca77,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:15:39 2015 UTC,Oh yea.. I'm not really disagreeing with him about that one.  Its either the bottom of S class or the top of A.  I'd personally rate Zoltan B just above it either way.

ftlgame,3dimg9,Dude579,6,Thu Jul 16 15:57:36 2015 UTC,"I imagine you're using Rock A, and I usually try to get rid of the dependency of missiles as soon as possible when I play, so I'd sell the Hull Missile to buy the Chain Laser and maybe the Ion Bomb for the future.  Other than that, you could just buy the Explosive Replicator and have fun trying to get a missile-based ship (it's kinda unlikely but would be amazing)."
ftlgame,3dimg9,LucasTyph,3,Thu Jul 16 16:15:44 2015 UTC,Good advice..  I'd probably avoid the Ion Bomb so early because it wouldn't be useful for a long time.  He could spend that scrap on shields.
ftlgame,3dimg9,chewbacca77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"True, but I personally love the Ion Bomb, even in the beginning of the game, provided you've got enough defenses to last for 20-ish seconds. Dropping 2 bars of shields for 20 seconds is pretty useful anytime, and for a single power bar? I'd say it's worth it."
ftlgame,3dimg9,LucasTyph,3,Fri Jul 17 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"Gah.. If you had about 20 more scrap, then I would have quite possibly suggested buying the Explosive Replicator and Defense Scrambler. But since you can't do both.. You have two options.  Option one is the get-off-explosives route, selling the Hull (and Artemis?) missiles, buying the Chain Laser and Hull Beam and buying one upgrade in Weapon power. The problem here is that you don't have 2 Shields yet and the Chain Laser is pretty slow to start with, so your ship is going to be very unstable until you can afford them.  Option Two is the 'maintaining the point of the ship' route. Purchase the Explosive Replicator and upgrade your Shields to the next barrier. You have enough missiles on hand to where the Replicator will allow you to sustain the current mode of attack for some time."
ftlgame,3dimg9,slowriderxcorps,2,Thu Jul 16 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"If you buy the chain laser and sell the hull missile, that would still give you 88 scrap to use with which you could either buy another layer of shields or buy drone control."
ftlgame,3dimg9,lpscharen,2,Thu Jul 16 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"That drone control and hull repair drone would be nice, but you lack the scrap."
ftlgame,3dimg9,robo-tronic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:56:59 2015 UTC,Chain Laser seems to be the way to go here IMO.
ftlgame,3dimg9,nitro67,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"Explosive replicator, chain laser doesn't combine well with a lot of weapons, ergo, not a long term investment. Replicator will save you on scrap for missiles untill you find a better weapon"
ftlgame,3dimg9,smartass32,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone for the advice so far! Once I get a chance to continue the run I will let you know what I did and how it worked out. If it is interesting enough, I may upload more screen shots. Also, which no-one is mentioned but I thought of was getting the ion bomb and the hull beam then maybe the replicator if I can afford the scrap.  edit: Decided on the explosive replicator since I like the idea of being true to this ship design.  edit 2: Got to sector 3 and picked up a weapon pre-igniter and then in sector 4 I sold the explosive replicator and hull missile for bl2 and halberd. Also found a laser charger and am running all except the artimus using the sven techinque."
ftlgame,3dimg9,LucasTyph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:17:34 2015 UTC,"The problem with that loadout is that you're going to need at least 20 seconds to drop shields, since you'd be relying on the Ion Bomb, and you would be completely screwed if it missed.  Maybe, if you keep your weapons, you'd get something out of it, but the synergy between Hull Beam, Ion Bomb, Artemis and Hull missile doesn't make sense - the first is good with something that drops shields in under 15 seconds; the second takes 20+ seconds to fire and fits mostly with a slow, high-power weapon (such as a Glaive Beam); the third is kind of versatile but still relies on missiles and can be shot down by Def. I drones; and the fourth is that 'Sell ASAP' weapon.  Also, you'd need 6 weapon power to run everything (3 without the missiles, but it doesn't really work, and 4 without the Hull Missile), which would take even more scrap. And, even after that, you haven't solved the Bulwark's worst problem: the missile dependency."

ftlgame,3di1zt,dardarian89,9,Thu Jul 16 13:11:51 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with the Torus Vortex is not the lack of crew, it's the weapon. It's the only ship in the game that can't get through 2 layer of shield with its starting equipments, which forces the player to invest in weapons much earlier than other ship and this often comes at the cost of defense. Personally, I'm not fond of this ship, but it's not the worst one in the bunch.    EDIT: Damn, messed up the name"

ftlgame,3di1zt,ChummyCommie,3,Thu Jul 16 14:45:29 2015 UTC,"The Vortex's main problem is not even that it has a single crew member, that its venting layout is horrid for the most part, or that you start it depending on drones to fight against boarders and repair your ship.  The reason I think it's among the worst ships in the game is it's starting weaponry. 2 power for the worse ion weapon in the game? 2 damage max? No way to take down two shields? Seriously though, could this get any worse?  That said, playing my first game on hard mode with that ship a couple of days ago, I was blessed by the RNG quite a bit and, against the flagship, I managed to win it somehow. Probably the last time I'll ever touch the ship."
ftlgame,3di1zt,LucasTyph,3,Thu Jul 16 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"Disagree wholeheartedly. I've beaten the game on normal with this ship btw. Haven't had luck on hard yet.  Lack of crew: No station manning bonuses. Only way to make up for this is to buy them or random encounters. Random encounters are going to be unlikely to add crew without a teleporter, so really you are buying them. That's ~150+ scrap just to man the rest of the systems.  Starting drones: Yeah, they are OK at what they do, but using them keeps you from using the much better drones (combat, beam and defense) since you only have three slots. The starting augment is an absolute joke as well. To make the ship 'effective' we're looking at getting better drones. Again, you are going to be out some scrap to make this work.  Weapons: Only able to get through layer one shields if both hit. Really these are only useful for the first section or two until you absolutely have to upgrade. Even worse on Hard where dodge rate for enemies is higher. Third time's the charm: more scrap required.  The ship brings almost nothing to the table other than a pretty good layout."
ftlgame,3di1zt,mr5010,0,Thu Jul 16 13:48:10 2015 UTC,You must have really bad luck to not find at least 3 cheap new crew members from fights or other events. If you sell one repair drone you still have one slot free for another drone. It's better to rely on new weapons for the offence anyways and save up the drones for a hacking system. The heavy ion is indeed bad but you have enough items to sell to buy nearly any weapon.
ftlgame,3di1zt,Cloudy_Customer,3,Thu Jul 16 20:48:48 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with you that it's not the worst ship out there, but it suffers from what I think of as 'brittleness'. Brittleness is when a single negative can be utterly crippling. The Engi B needs to pray it doesn't get boarded early (3+ boarders, 2+ Rock or Mantis) and you're done for). It can never gamble on events that may give you crew but might also take one away.   It doesn't have anything quite as bad as the Stormwalker or Fregitade, but it's not a good ship either."
ftlgame,3di1zt,51Gunner,3,Thu Jul 16 13:40:02 2015 UTC,"I like all the ships. Some are challenging, some are easy peasy. The Vortex is definitely on the challenging side of the scale.  You know the one singular thing that would make this ship so much better? Clonebay ;)"
ftlgame,3di1zt,Anistuffs,2,Thu Jul 16 14:54:54 2015 UTC,Any ship can become deadly given enough time. Problem is that everything this ship starts with is just awful. I wouldn't rank this as the worst ship in the game but it's certainly bottom five.
ftlgame,3di1zt,superfantastic1,2,Thu Jul 16 13:45:15 2015 UTC,"I actually enjoy Engi B.  It really only has two distinct weaknesses which can usually be compensated quickly: Crew and firepower.  It also has a lot of things that can be safely sold.. At least the Drone Reactor Booster and one System Repair Drone.  If you find a good weapon like a Flak I or BL2, you can also sell your heavy Ion."
ftlgame,3di1zt,chewbacca77,2,Thu Jul 16 13:45:51 2015 UTC,"I can count 6 ships that start with drones. 3 need to spend a drone part to damage the enemy ship. 1 has no shield system. 1 is generally accepted as fantastic (Mantis B) 1 is the Engi B. It can damage things without boarding or spending drone parts, and still gets a weapons system. That'd be nice if drone parts were super-valuable or something, but really, it's overvalued. Most of the time it's a worse Engi A/C or Zoltan C. Its lack of crew, lack of sensors, poor ventilation, poor weapons, and lack of any other real advantage means I can't consider it good. It's not utter shit. You can win with it. It's just certainly not 'good' by any stretch."
ftlgame,3di1zt,Kittsy,2,Thu Jul 16 21:25:13 2015 UTC,Engi B is awesome.  Drones can be wickedly powerful.
ftlgame,3di1zt,mmss,2,Thu Jul 16 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"In general it almost seems easier to start out with a good drone system and add crew during the game, instead of starting with a good crew but no drones.   Absolutley not. Earlier crew who can earn exp and be used anyway you want is far worth more then some drones which you can't even control properly."
ftlgame,3di1zt,Random-Webtoon-Fan,2,Fri Jul 17 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"The weapons are alright to start out with.   If you don't mind not being able to break two shields and having to wait 13 seconds every time your Heavy Ion misses, not to mention the Heavy Laser missing. Both weapons need to hit to deal damage to enemies with one shield and you have no other options when it comes to offense.   One way to make this ship much better would be to replace the other system repair drone with an offensive drone of some sort. Even having Ion Blast I and 2 starting weapon power (instead of Heavy Ion and 3) would be better. But it's obviously a challenge ship, maybe the clearest example of that in FTL as it really doesn't have any significant upsides."
ftlgame,3di1zt,corvid_,3,Fri Jul 17 08:22:15 2015 UTC,"it's actually quite a good ship, first sector has very little boarding, and it gives you more freedom in your crew setup. Don't know why people hate it but I guess there are people who can play Engi and people who can not."
ftlgame,3di1zt,smartass32,4,Thu Jul 16 13:38:03 2015 UTC,"Why is Engi B considered the worst ship? Because it is!  It's not just that it has one downside like most ship, it has a lot of them with a one advantages : starting with a drone system.  All the downsides :   Start with only 1 crew No Sensors or Slugs Only 1 engine Start with the worst Ion weapon Bad venting layout (no airlock in the top and right part of the ship) Can't pierce through 2 layers of shield   That is all this accumulation of downsides that make it so bad. It doesn't means it's unplayable or you can't have fun playing it but simply that it's the ship with the worst starting."

The first is easy enough; you just have to make sure to pick up all those systems. The loss of cabin pressure is also easy in my opinion. You just turn off oxygen and vent the whole place. Reassign the engines Lanius to piloting and you can use the steady stream of clones for stuff like repairing systems if they get damaged.

ftlgame,3db0hw,SomethingWittyUrl,10,Tue Jul 14 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"""Pah"" the man on the helm said - hints of arrogance in his voice. ""A puny crystal ship?"" He said, relaying the information to his fellow crewmembers from the onboard scanners. ""They expect to take us out with that? I've defeated plenty of innexperienced Crystals: chancing their luck with the god-awful federation."" But as the flagship powered down it's FTL and lurched to a stop the pilot's cocky grin disappeared as he realised that his conceitedness might have become his undoing. ""Flak..."" He managed to whimper before a barrage of dilapidated ship parts and scrap flew collided with the ship.   He stumbled forward oppening the comms systems to assess damage as the simultaneous impacts rocked the ship.  ""CAPTAIN, SHIELDS ARE DOWN""  ""WE'VE LOST JENSON""  ""SIR, MEDBAY OFFLINE""  Many voiced crackled over the intercom and the captain to make sense of everything. Quickly and efficiently he began organising his men, starting repairs and launching a series of missiles at the Crystal madman who dared to defile his beautiful ship with flak.   The encounter seemed to go on for a matter of hours but, in reality, was only mere minutes. The rebel flagship trembled as it endured wave after wave of flak assaults. Eventually the comms went quiet and the, once cocky, pilot realised he was now alone. The flak had entirely wiped out their ion weapons and laser systems, it had even taken down the Zoltan shield that he had activated and now it had taken the one thing most precious to him. His crew; the only family he had ever had, and even that was a stretch as most of them hated who he had become; the tyrannical persona he had adopted after the construction of his flagship was completed.  The exhausted pilot sighed heavily, recounting the many wrongs in his life, and how he could have changed his ways and became a better person. He then looked out the hull towards the Crystal ship he had once thought of as 'puny' and watched as several volleys of flak began approaching his flagship at an alarmingly fast speed. ""Flak..."" He whispered to nobody as his impending doom approached, ""It had to be Flak.""  Apologies for formatting, i'm using mobile."
ftlgame,3db0hw,YoungsterJoey99,4,Wed Jul 15 01:16:46 2015 UTC,"Aww, now I feel bad for using flak :( Still, can't be worse than having your entire crew teleported aboard the enemy ship one by one to be slaughtered. Just mind control whoever you want to kill and you can use your teleporter to beam them onto your ship, and they'll man a system for you."

Some people just like to watch ships burn is highly dependent on getting a Fire Beam, so just start watching for those and then try for it."

ftlgame,3dczm2,PastaRavioli,3,Wed Jul 15 08:29:11 2015 UTC,"Halbard Beam hands down.  I have never found the Pike to be a good late-game weapon, so I would sell it.  The Halbard, IMHO, is one of the most powerful weapons in the game.  Also, repair to green (not full though), and buy all 4 fuel.  Use the rest of your scrap to upgrade your weapons to run the Halbard, don't upgrade your reactor (use the point from the med bay), and then upgrade med bay, doors, and sensors to level 2 (for blue events)."
ftlgame,3dczm2,n_slash_a,2,Wed Jul 15 22:47:11 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely go for Hull Laser 1. It gives you one extra laser to help get through shields, and it's a good weapon later in the game for damage. If you can get a flak or something else half decent to swap out another basic laser, you'll be at a pretty decent point offensively.  I also just about never pass up a reverse ion field. That's really just my personal preference, though."
ftlgame,3dczm2,samtheredditman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:35:44 2015 UTC,"It'd help to have a bit more context, such as what sector you're in. I'm guessing based off the fact that hull repair costs 3 scrap per point that you're around sector 4. (Normal difficulty?)  Based on that I'd suggest hull repairs up to 25, refuel, and get the Hull laser. Enemies are going to start having three shields soon, and their dodge rates are gonna get obnoxious even with two shields. I really like the Reverse Ion Field as well so I'd get that.   Save the rest of your scrap for another day. Your next targets should be another shield bubble, another increase in firepower, and a new system (hacking, cloaking, mind control). You have a good foundation here but you should try to build on it."
ftlgame,3dczm2,51Gunner,0,Wed Jul 15 17:14:23 2015 UTC,"Probably too late to be much help, but neither of those weapons appeal to me unless you're in a later phase of the game (sector 5+) with that weapon loadout.  If anything I'd just repair and load up on fuel and hold out for cloaking, unless you found a spectacular weapon to complement your pike beam such as a Burst Laser II or Flak. It would help to know what sector you're on though."

Lanius: only good when they're alone. Having 7 crew members interacting and an isolated guy without oxygen just feels weird. Also, they're not very common.  Crystal: I've never actually had a crystal crew member when I'm not playing Rock C or Crystal ships, even though they're good.  Rockmen: too slow, easily exploited when boarding against them.  Mantis: Can't repair anything in time. Only useful for boarding/fighting against boarders/manning doors.  Engi: pretty good, but they can't fight. Having engies on a ship that's not easily vented is not a good idea.  Zoltan: can also be known as Mobile Reactors. Don't do more than the usual.  Humans: common and uninteresting. Can get skills faster, which doesn't help at all, as I've always got a fully trained crew for the flagship.  Slugs: can't be mind-controlled, can see beyond their room (useful for ships without sensors) and gives you the location of the enemies, as well as their race and what they are doing. No disadvantages.  Clearly, slug =  FTLmaster race."

You can only find Lanius in their own sectors, but slugs are found in any nebula (maybe even outside them, I don't really remember), and the odds of finding nebulae in the sector map is far greater than finding an abandoned sector."
ftlgame,3db3zq,LucasTyph,3,Thu Jul 16 14:01:26 2015 UTC,I will always make an effort to get at least one engi. They have some good blue events and faster repair speeds is invaluable in harder difficulties
ftlgame,3db3zq,superfantastic1,5,Wed Jul 15 00:27:15 2015 UTC,"I like all the crew, and I'm always glad of a new one. I'll only be annoyed at who I get if I already have 8 and they don't mesh well with the theme of my current run.  Mantis - Superfast, and probably the best boarders out there. My most successful crew member is still a Mantis. Badr Hari I salute you.  Crystals - Crystal Lockdown + boarding, I like to hit O2 or weapons. Positioning them on your own ship can be difficult though. Mantis + Crystal is probably THE salt and pepper team.  Lanius - Move slowly but suck all the oxygen out of a room, making them outstanding boarders, as long as you only have a lanius boarding party.  Rock - Move slowly but immune to fire and have massive health. Great boarders, if you can light the opposing ship up and hammer their crew while they burn. Make an excellent salt n pepper team with anyone except Lanius.  Slug - Same as humans but can't be mind controlled, and are telepathic. Pretty much no downside, but they're just average boarders.  Engi - Fucking AWFUL boarders, just as bad at repelling them, but good movement speed, and double repair speed. I love throwing 4 engi into a room to repair everything... 4 mantis, not so much.  Human - Learn skills faster. I like to put them in piloting and engines. To me it doesn't make that much of a difference for anything else. Due to their faster learning they're pretty decent boarders after clearing a few ships.  Zoltan - One free power bar, but weak as fuck. Absolutely atrocious boarders, unless you have a clone bay and are doing the old suicide bombing with Zoltans technique. I never put them in piloting, that's just a waste."

ftlgame,3db3zq,battlecatluke1,3,Wed Jul 15 04:47:42 2015 UTC,"Engi : You can never have too much Engi, they will repair anything super fast. They can fit at every post but I try to have them in a System they can easily move from (Shields, Doors or Sensors) Mantis : Mostly useful with Boarding strategy, I like having 1-2 on board especially with Engi/Zoltan crew for anti-boarding. Like Engis I want them to be able to move around. Crystal : Rare but always good to have. They will either replace my Mantis or work with them for Boarding and Ship defense. They are good in Engine or Piloting because you can use their ability to keep your dodge bonus longer when boarded. Zoltan : Some free power. I want at least 2 for Ion protection on Shields. Slugs : I only need one for piloting and Slug vision in Nebula. Average stats make them fit everywhere. Rocks : I rarely hire Rockmen unless I start with them. They are slow and will take a long time to go into a place to repair. Boarders and Fire will also have time to damage stuff. They are good in Piloting or Engines where they don't have to move much. Lanius : Only if I plan a Lanius boarding strategy. Though if I go through a Abandonned sector I will hire one early if I can because of all the blue choices. They are good at Piloting and Engines to prevent Fire/Boarders but it can play against you if they are mind controlled or you get boarded by Lanius. Human : Meh. Their low cost and lower experience requirement make them good filler for your team.   Ideal team will be : Slug (Piloting), Zoltan x2 (Shield), Rockman (Engine), Engi x2 (Weapon + Doors), Mantis x2 (Sensors + Doors).  If there is a x4 Teleport switch the dual Zoltan with Crystal or Mantis."

ftlgame,3db3zq,Kuirem,2,Fri Jul 17 09:01:09 2015 UTC,"It always depends on what kind of ship I'm flying, so what I like and use varies greatly. In general, I look at how well they combine with the rest of the crew, I don't plan my crew positions before RNGesus has granted me them.   Engi: I don't go out of my way to buy/find an engi, unless I've only got two Mantis ( who wouldn't be able to fix life support to save their own lives). Having an engi is always a bonus, but when my crew has been maxed I don't bother switching up all the stations to accommodate for it.  Human's: never dump a maxed human, never buy a human. I don't like throwing them into combat without training or positive numbers because I believe that RNGesus is a bad bad man.  Rock: it's always awkward when I find a rock, because to benefit from the rock's advantages you need a teleporter, another rock or mantis ( I love this combination, rock soaks damage and the Mantis kills) or a bad fire suppressant strategy. And you can't plan RNGesus's ways. So if I do get one and I don't have a teleporter or fellow boarder, they end up on either doors or pilot. Make for great pilot's though, no fire damage, extra health so you don't have to run em back to the medbay as often and risk a superfluous new hole in your b-hind. And if your cockpit is boarded, you only need to run in one extra character ( a human pilot for example will have sustained quite a lot of damage by the time reinforcements walk in, and will have to be ferried off to the medbay, and another character will need to run in, resulting in 3 crewmembers away from their posts. )   Zoltan: there are only two situations in which you think about your zoltan.  Situation 1: ok I'm about to face the mothership but I've maxed out my reactor and can't run my dual Vulcan""s at the same time, I need more power. ZOLTAN!"" Situation 2: ""captain, the mothership is preparing it's next volley, and our shields are fully ionized!"" ""where the fuck did our shields go? Where's that fucking zoltan?"" ""Sir, Emily died of a papercut."" ""ZOLTAN!""   Mantis: I never mind a Mantis, and I've never regretted purchasing one. Never in my life will I ever trust a Mantis in an escape pod though.   Lanius: unless you have multiple Lanius and focus on boarding, maintaining lanius is more troubling than beneficial. You can't trust em not to suck the life out of a room, they don't play well with others and whenever you tell them to repair something it always sounds like they're snacking off of your ship while you're not looking. Great pilots though. If I've already got a skilled pilot and don't want to lose em, out the airlock they go. It's okay. They don't breathe. They don't need air. They'll be fine.   Slug: mostly put em on weapons ( engines and shields need constant engi/zoltan supervision, and by the time I find a slug I usually already have most of the roles figured out (except for weapons, which I station last ( easy max )). Always handy, but never more than two ( I can't stand watching them move and two slugs doesn't add any new bonus)  Crystal: too rare, but interesting boarders.   Ideally, zoltan on shields, rock on helm, engi on weapons, engines and doors, slug on sensors, 2 Mantis on the teleporter."

You can board breached rooms cause they take less damage from low o2, you can board rooms on fire cause they have 125 hp, you can lock in 1 person to focus him or you can tp and lock medbay to destroy it and you can board auto ships with lvl1 teleporter."

Zoltans -  Free power is good. Being super fragile and messing with how my ship's power is directed just by walking around is annoying. I'll use both these races just to fill crew slots if I have nothing better.   Favourites: Slugs, Engi, and Mantis.   Slugs - They're just better humans. Lots of blue options too, and obviously their telepathic sensors are brilliant. Engi - Great for any purpose on a ship except repelling boarders/boarding. Lots of blue options. Mantis - There are lots of boarding/boarded events in the game, and Mantis are just the best for dealing with this.   I will typically try to get at least 1 Rock, because that gives some great blue options. Crystal are great if you find them, but honestly they're so rare that I never really worry about them. Lanius give great blue options in Abandoned sectors, but otherwise they're just kind of ""whatever"" - no oxygen is kind of useful for keeping fires down, and kind of annoying on a crowded ship."

ftlgame,3db3zq,beefhaze,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"Races generally go well to complement what you already have.  For that matter, I think engis can complement almost any ship and racial mix, because as long as your essential stations are manned, they can roam and repair whatever's hit.  I consider mantis to be the second best complement, because they can deal with boarders efficiently and (mostly) safely. I think 2 mantis on any crew that has all essential systems manned is ideal.  You don't want a full crew of either. An all-engi crew can't handle boarders well without upgraded doors and/or unmanning stations to assist the fight. An all-mantis crew will easily find themselves overwhelmed by accumulating system damage.  I consider Lanius and especially Crystal to be too rare to consider for any tier-list. I wouldn't want to visit a Lanius sector unless I'm not a boarding ship and I have a good anti-boarding crew.  Every other crew, I feel, is useful purely for their own niche. Humans exempted because they have no niche. Slugs make an excellent pilot, but I feel they are superior to humans."

Engi and Rockman as backup in either camera or doors.  Mantis and Crystal duo teleporters.  Of course, this is very prone to change.

ftlgame,3db3zq,Random-Webtoon-Fan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:42:58 2015 UTC,"My preferences (for what it's worth - take what you're given!):  1) Engi. Doubled repair speed is always useful, and they have a great many blue events. Bonus points because their blue events seem to be the ones that pop up the most often. Malfunctioning defense system, plague on a colony... all good. Getting Virus the Super-Engi is pretty easy, as is the quest for the Stealth Cruiser.   2) Mantis. Even if I'm not running a boarding ship, it's nice to have a couple on your crew to chase enemy boarders away. The slow repair speed is manageable by keeping an Engi around. :)  3) Lanius. While hard to acquire in any great numbers, my love for these guys has been cemented by the Lanius B. Much better if you can get two of these guys than one - that lets you at least safely double them up for faster repair. Inability to stick an Engi in with them for long handicaps them a bit, but their potential as all-purpose boarders wins them many points and a place in my heart.  4) Slugs. While their blue options are nowhere near as common as an Engi's (especially if you avoid nebulae), they're quite useful when you do get one and there's a large variety of them. They get bonus points for the ""Engage in a Duel of the Mind"" event. Having a Slug means you can skip on level 2 sensors for a bit, and if your sensors do go down (or don't exist) it's less handicapping. The immunity to mind control is a nice flavor bonus that doesn't psych me up too much someone else just gets mind controlled instead, and by murphy's law it's your experienced Mantis.  5) Zoltan. Fun for the extra power, but the low HP really annoys me. If they've taken even 10 damage they're susceptible to being 1-shot by a stray large missile. Annoying to have to re-power the rooms they walk through. They also suffer from a lack of blue options - especially as I try to avoid Zoltan sectors.   6) Rock. Good boarders, but not great without setting something on fire. Some good blue events, but not enough for my taste. Waiting for one to walk from one end of the ship to another is agonizing sometimes, especially when it's a big ship with a level 1 medbay.   7) Humans. Common and uninteresting.   8) Crystal. I've got a couple hundred games, been to the hidden Crystal sector exactly twice. I always feel super-nervous boarding with them, because if they die they're not replaceable. They're not bad in their own right, but I leave them on the bottom because they're purely luck-based for anything but the three ships that start with them. (Only 2 starting with more than 1)."
ftlgame,3db3zq,51Gunner,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:41:35 2015 UTC,"I find it very odd that humans suck in a game made by humans. I'm starting to question who really made this game.   tinfoil hat crinkles   But seriously, I think my personal favorite races are Engi and Mantis. Fixing things twice as fast is always an incredible help, and having 2+ Engi is a great way to make sure nothing stays offline for long. Mantis are great as well. They make such astounding boarding parties due to their speed and damage. They suck in the ways Engi are good and vice versa, so a full crew of Engi and Mantis would be a pretty great setup all things considered.   Rockmen are great supports. They can put out fires no problem and serve as a good punching bag for boarding parties/bodyguards. However, Their speed makes them unusable in many situations. Shields are on fire? It's usually quicker to vent the room rather than send in Rocky. Slug fit the support category as well IMO. Basically just humans with sensory bonus, which can help on a boarding ship w/o level 2 sensors. Pretty mundane other than that.   Zoltans are actually very meh in my opinion. The reactor power is nice, but Zoltans really suck other than that. If they die (which is likely due to low health), everyone on board takes damage. I kid you not, i've seen Zoltan crusier runs fail because one Zoltan died and it set off a domino effect. AND you relied on them powering a system the whole run, so if they die you're either assed out or manage your power systems.   I recently just got all the ships (yay finally!) so I haven't had too much time with Lanius or Crystal. Lanius make fantastic boarding crew, but really suck on board. You pretty much have to keep them off in one section of the ship as to not damage everyone else on board. However, they are incredible breach repair units. So basically, I keep them as closet drones that either slaughter or repair holes in the ship. Crystals just feel like a blend of human and rockmen with a cool ass ability. I think their damage/health is a bit low to have them be great boarding units, but lockdown is a good way to take out systems. Lower suffocation damage is whatever; not all that beneficial in the grand scheme of things–and is essentially just a weaker Lanius mechanic.   My ratings:   A Tier: Mantis, Engi, Crystal (I think?)   B Tier: Lanius, Slug, Rockmen, Zoltan   C Tier: Humans (I'm on to you, Matt and Justin.)"
ftlgame,3db3zq,crushfan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:53:08 2015 UTC,"I think my general-purpose favorites are Mantises and Engi. Their abilities and penalties balance each other almost perfectly, and being able to handle boarders and make quick repairs are both essential for avoiding and mitigating damage. It's best to have them man systems that are easy to leave unattended, though.  Zoltans are cool too, especially if you have enough to put in your shield room. Free, un-ionizable energy? Yes please.  Lanius and Crystals are my favorite boarders. Frankly, the Crystals are OP (I guess their insane rarity balances that out, though). I imagine they'd be especially effective together since the Crystals can trap victims in rooms and also take less suffocation damage, but I've never been lucky enough to try that out.  I think Slugs are overrated. They don't have any penalties, but both of their abilities are made much less useful simply by having L2 sensors (outside of nebulas, at least) and mind control. Rockmen are useful with boarding and fire-starting weapons, but I think they're too slow to use defensively. Humans are humans.  I just realized my least favorite races are the ones that are most often considered the best pilots."
ftlgame,3d8kul,Cobrand,2,Tue Jul 14 10:13:29 2015 UTC,"I had something like that in my last hard mode run with the Red-Tail. In sector 7, I thought I had a good layout with BLII, a couple of my basic lasers and a Hull Beam... it turns out it's near impossible to drop four shields with that. A lot of bad luck (found a ship with 3x BLII and another weapon that I don't remember) took me most of my hull, until I had only 3 HP.  I managed to run away, hoping for a store. I had the Long-Ranged Scanners, so I could see where there was a fight (I was mostly looking to survive rather than fighting). After 5 or so empty jumps, I found a store and bought Flak I + hacking and sold my basic lasers. Next jump, free Hull Repair Drone.  Flagship went down in no time."

Tactical scrap calculation is the key to success."

What killed me is the ASB; when I arrived at this beacon I had 9 or 10 hull, since the asb would probably hit me twice with my non upgraded engines (probably more since the ship would probably hit the pilot or the engines), it was like I had 3 or 4 health for the ship. Needless to say with this enemy ship's weaponry, I didn't stand a chance.  True, I could have upgraded my shields instead of buying a clonebay, it would have helped me, but I still don't think I'd have made it, or really on the razor's edge.  I like to buy a clonebay early because this ship is so dependent on crewmembers, you can't really afford to lose a precious mantis or rock. If I hadn't bought it when I did, I'd probably have lost half my crew by the second screen.  But more importantly, I'd have survived if I hadn't misplanned my route, that's what led me to death here."

You want to spend your scrap normally at the start, you need to make your ship as strong as possible. Towards the end, start saving scrap up (about sector 6) and try to plan your route to hit the maximum beacons. As long as you have a decent ship it shouldn't be too hard. Could be a good strategy to get a crew teleporter since killing the crew give better rewards in general and lanius can board any ship."

Plus, I think Scrap Hoarder is much easier to do on the Shrike than the Kruos because of the extra drops from boarding.  Anyway, for Loss of Cabin Pressure, just dismiss the human at the start and vent the whole ship. Sell the respirator augment at the first store for an extra 25 scrap and try to hit up an abandoned sector along the way to gain more lanius crew (hire from stores and always keep 40+ scrap at all times for the Translator event).

I think you can pressurize three rooms while staying under 20% - Hacking can be dealt with by turning off O2.   Still, if you really want to go for it I'd suggest playing more-or-less standard for your first few sectors. Trying to be stingy there still won't net you a ton of scrap, and it'll backfire into a negative snowball effect. Keep your eyes open for Long-Range scanners that can help you avoid the dreaded empty beacons, and that will let you explore Nebulae more profitably. Scrap Recovery arms will always pay off for you on this achievement run unless you get it from the elusive Sector 8 shop."

I've read more than once that even though system damage isn't effected by race, they are damaged faster if your crew has hand to hand combat levels..  Do you know for a fact that nothing effects how fast systems are destroyed by crew?"
ftlgame,3d6h9v,chewbacca77,3,Tue Jul 14 12:21:53 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I've specifically tested Level 0 vs Level 2 crew, Engi vs Mantis - it doesn't matter, the system is always damaged at the same rate.  I was definitely surprised to learn melee skill doesn't affect system damage as well.  I haven't specifically tested Mind Control or Boarding Drones in this fashion, so it's possible they're different."
ftlgame,3d6h9v,chewbacca77,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"Interesting!  I'd be willing to bet that Boarding Drones damage things at the same rate as everything else.  Regarding Mind Control.. I'm not really sure.  I know that sometimes mind control doesn't even destroy one bar of a system, and the flagship's mind control can easily destroy two full bars.  Does level three mind control last more than twice as long as level one?  If so, it probably damages at the same rate as everything else."

ftlgame,3d233x,c0de1143,18,Mon Jul 13 00:51:40 2015 UTC,I swear the BL3 has some unique top-secret attribute that makes it less accurate than other lasers. I've literally dodged all five shots in a volley on more than one occasion.

ftlgame,3d233x,Anistuffs,81,Mon Jul 13 02:18:50 2015 UTC,"Don't you see though? It makes perfect sense, they're sequelizing!  The Burst laser was a good, solid, reliable weapon. Not the greatest bang for your buck it was still an efficient and practical weapon.  Building on the success of their popular Burst Laser I, they re-released it as the Burst Laser II- complete with an upgraded energy storage capacity and more refined production methods, allowing better performance at only a minor increase in power consumption.  Then, Burst Co. got bought out by Enhanced Armaments. After much testing and development in controlled environments, EA determined that the best way to improve on the ever popular BLII would be to further increase its rate of fire, allowing a single mount to throw out a torrent of fire. In W3 videos, the BLIII seemed to be a pinnacle of Burst weapons, but then it hit the shelves and the complaints started- The power matrix was a cheaper, less efficient version which drastically increased charge times, reduced capacitor capacity, and resulted in significantly increased power consumption. The patented Burst DispersionTM technology that allowed past versions to maintain accuracy while dealing with the massive heat and electromagnetic interference of previously fired rounds has been scaled up proportionately to the new rate of fire, but the materials can't keep up, so the accuracy of the last few rounds falls sharply. Worse- the now-oversized-but-still-not-capable-enough cooling system is mounted where the old one was- on the turret. The mounting servos weren't upgraded to deal with the increased weight, making the weapon less accurate than its predecessors, despite EA's claims  to the contrary. The system shipped with EA's Determined Reticule MechanicsTM software- capable of comparing target evasion patterns to those seen before by weapons developed by EA from data stored on their central system, and from there working out a shot pattern most likely to hit. Despite promises to the contrary, users of the BLIII have found that DRM doesn't significantly affect accuracy, but nearly doubles the time required for the computer to develop an aspect-lock.  While on paper the BLIII appears to be a natural sucessor, they've been sitting on the shelves, and Charge Inc.'s line of Vulcans has left EA in the dust. EA has even announced the cancellation of the BLII line of lasers, though they insist they will continue to offer support for the systems.  Meanwhile, the original creators of the Burst LaserTM have formed with the developers of the ever popular MiniBeamTM to create their all new FlakTM - coming to a store near you!"

ftlgame,3d233x,XXIAIXX,4,Mon Jul 13 15:02:25 2015 UTC,"You're completely correct. In theory, the Decentralized Laser ComputerTM allows the circuit board to be upgraded considerably over time without having to replace the original package. Unfortunately, Enhanced Armaments have supposedly been using this as an opportunity to ship BLIIIs with low-quality circuit boards, knowing that people will be forced to pay additionally if they want to get a fully functioning Burst Laser, when most companies would provide that kind of maintenance for free and allow upgraded packages for improved firmware, EA's Burst Laser III is barely functional otherwise."

That factor definitely makes it less attractive as a primary damage-dealing weapon for the player, though, so it should definitely be used to break shields for a heavy or hull laser."

One cool thing I noticed is that with a maxed-out gunner, the IB2 actually fires quickly enough to get two shots in before shields come back and block the shot. So a single IB2 might be able to keep L2 oxygen ionized enough to suffocate the crew, as long as the ship only has one shield. I'd have to test it against a ship that I know has L2 oxygen to confirm though, which means either getting maxed out sensors (which is impractical) or hacking (which is hilariously redundant)."
ftlgame,3d3r5w,XelNecra,13,Mon Jul 13 07:47:35 2015 UTC,"I like missle-based weapons in boarding strategies to disable medbay because you don't have to destroy all shields to do that.  They are also ok as a support weapon (small bomb, ion bomb, breach bomb, artemis, swarm) when RNG didn't give you a lot of lasers and you can't easily destroy shields. You can just use missle weapons to destroy shields/helm so you can actually damage their ship."
ftlgame,3d3r5w,resont,9,Mon Jul 13 08:05:32 2015 UTC,"Missile weapons are bad in general. The Artemis launcher is alright, but the rest are bottom-of-the-barrel.

They're good weapons for enemies to use against the player and that's all.  Bombs, on the other hand, are often superb."

Defense Drones are also rather uncommon - only Engi ships and Rebel Riggers might have them, and even then you're not guaranteed to see a Defense Drone I in particular.

I wish I had some footage to point to, but I don't have any on hand at the moment, so I guess I'm probably wrong.  EDIT: Yeah, looking back at the old Ohmwrecker footage, it seems Hermes missiles had 14s cooldown even during the GDC beta, so they were probably 14s cooldown during the normal pre-AE release.

ftlgame,3d3r5w,Leylite,4,Wed Jul 15 11:53:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, I usually take a Swarm missile if I come across one. For only two power and the potential to release a barrage of 3 missiles, it's incredibly useful in conjunction with a laser of any kind."
ftlgame,3d3r5w,battlecatluke1,5,Mon Jul 13 08:35:31 2015 UTC,"It also has a good chance of causing breach and fire, which is a big plus. Swarm is by far my favorite missile based weapon (not including bombs)."
ftlgame,3d3r5w,thesandwitch,4,Mon Jul 13 20:24:41 2015 UTC,"I recently discovered that Swarm Missile is actually really really good. It's got a long charge time and requires a missile, but with a full charge it can fire three missiles (for the price of one, mind you) in rapid succession with relative accuracy. Plus it only requires two power. It's not nearly as exciting or useful as a Flak or Halberd beam, but it can seriously help in a pinch. It is also especially useful on taking on the flagship.   Also, you have the option of firing one or two missiles if you need them quickly, which can help you take out an enemy system before something nasty happens. I dislike missile weapons in general, and I don't think they're too viable even with explosives replicator, but Swarm missile is something very special in my opinion."
ftlgame,3d3r5w,crushfan,5,Tue Jul 14 17:03:37 2015 UTC,"350+ hours here and counting; still not boring, so don't worry :)  I don't like missiles and it does not make sense to spend money for ammo (maybe on normal you can do it, but on hard scrap is never enough).  They can really help you as complementary weapon, but only if they are energy efficient and your ship has four slots for weapons... So basically only the artemis can really help you. Anyway I prefer a small bomb or an ion bomb (really powerful) paired with something that let you drop your enemy evasion stat (mind control, hacking)."
ftlgame,3d3r5w,_gall0ws,4,Mon Jul 13 11:44:07 2015 UTC,"I can tell you why missiles are 'bad': Asymmetry. Dealing 1+ extra damage to the player ship every fight due to an extremely hard to block/avoid missile quickly builds up into a game over, especially when the enemies unused missiles don't matter after the fight. Dealing 1+ extra damage to the enemy ship every fight due to balanced missiles? Would just make them usable and expand your options, and each missile you use or save could matter after the fight so you still wouldn't want to go all-missile spam-fest. Even with a Replicator you have a limit..  You realize that the ones that are allowed to be reasonably good are either unused by enemies (swarm, 1 power Artemis, Pegasus, heal bomb, repair bomb), or don't damage the ship (other bombs). Enemy Breach missiles, for example, still feel dangerous if you don't have a defense drone due to the asymmetry, but missiles are a thing that just require different AI/player balance, and most are balanced towards the enemy."
ftlgame,3d3r5w,Kittsy,3,Mon Jul 13 12:19:27 2015 UTC,"I usually don't like to rely on missiles, but if I get one for free and I don't have much else to take down heavily shielded ships.  Ideally, I'd use one with a heavy burst laser, and a beam of some sort. Get the shields down enough for the lasers to do the rest of the work to open way for the beam.   Resource management is definitely the hardest part about using them early on. I often rant about missiles and tendency to miss, but you can manage that by focusing the helm first.  And yeah, if I'm using missiles early on, I'll often buy most of what they have.  Also, pay attention to your foe's offers to yield. I just got an offer that included 6 missiles, and when I denied them and blew them up I got none."

ftlgame,3d3r5w,MuttonTime,3,Mon Jul 13 10:12:35 2015 UTC,Engines are sometimes the better target. I only prefer helm against Auto Scouts; those can't repair their systems fast enough to get out of zero dodge before your next volley the way most crew-carrying ships can.

ftlgame,3d3r5w,slowriderxcorps,2,Mon Jul 13 17:25:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think missiles can ever be efficient in the game as-is. They don't fit well into either of the plans you can use for eliminating other ships.   If you are gunboating, they don't combo efficiently with your energy weapons. At best they can either disable piloting or two layers of shields (and that's for a 4-damage, 3 power Breach missile.) Problem is that a 2-power Flak or laser weapon can do the same, faster, without an ammo restriction. The missile can also be shot down, and will be shot down on flagship phase 2.  If you're boarding your enemies, the hull damage they deal is actually undesirable. Bombs are better in every way; can't be shot down, don't weaken the enemy hull, and often come with nice side-effects of guaranteed breaches or fires."
ftlgame,3d3r5w,NeJin,2,Mon Jul 13 12:42:47 2015 UTC,"Literally the only reason why missile weapons are really bad to have to rely upon in this game is simple: Phase 2 of the flagship exists. When the mandatory final boss of the game carries the means to block an entire vector of attack, you know you cannot want to be reliant upon it.  Still, missiles can still be useful, primarily in boarding roles. Having two decently strong explosive options makes boarding and eliminating the crew on Phase 1 a cakewalk, and it makes the rest of the fight a hell of a lot easier as you can board and break stuff with complete impunity.  It doesn't help that the missile weapons kind of suck in their own ways. The Hermes is fast and decently strong but at 3 power it's way, WAY too inefficient for only 3 damage, especially given the Breach Bomb II exists and is only marginally slower. The Hull Missile is slow as molasses and doesn't do enough damage, the Swarm Missiles are very slow for their overall damage and don't even have good accuracy against 1-tile rooms. The Breach Missile is slower still but at the very least anything it touches is likely to never come back online for the rest of the fight. The Pegasus Missiles are really the only missile weapon worth using unless you happen to find the Defense Scrambler."
ftlgame,3d3r5w,Captain_Lord_Avalon,2,Mon Jul 13 14:27:23 2015 UTC,"Missiles work well as support weapons on boarding and Pure-Artillery Fed ships. Since you're relying on something else to do damage, you can use them against key-systems and otherwise conserve them. Otherwise the huge ammunition cost coupled with enemy getting increasingly tougher usually just makes it not worthwile to rely on them, though you can use them for good effect against the flagship if you have a lot of missiles. Dual Hermes/Pegasus makes short work of most things."
ftlgame,3d3r5w,Trotski7,2,Mon Jul 13 14:58:56 2015 UTC,"Missile weapons suck. I use them until I can get something better, Small Bomb or better if using ammo.

ftlgame,3d3r5w,Immortails,2,Mon Jul 13 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"Missile weapons are great.  They can be very situational though.  If you find yourself not getting a lot of missiles, sell the weapon. If you have a lot or a replicator, keep it. Though mostly, I typically end up selling a missile weapon. I like to keep them as long as possible, but getting other beam weapons, or using their power consumption for something like a good drone or hacking or something is usually better in the long run."

ftlgame,3d1dyw,Captain_Lord_Avalon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:54:11 2015 UTC,But when I have possibility in a first shop to buy clonebay/medbay OR BL2/HL2 what should I buy? Imo weapon is more important.
ftlgame,3d1dyw,Captain_Lord_Avalon,3,Sun Jul 12 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"BL2, you can use right away, and it's a BL2. I'd buy a bay over HL2, because that's 3 power.  Your boarders are a weapon, too."
ftlgame,3d1dyw,Leylite,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in that case I'd buy the weapon since you can still use the Heal Bomb to heal for a little while longer (and with the weapon you might need fewer Artemis missiles to take out medbays on not-so-dangerous ships)."
ftlgame,3d1dyw,hornplayerKC,5,Sun Jul 12 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"This probably won't help you in the majority of runs, but just know that Slug B holds the honor of ship with the highest offensive potential. If you're lucky enough to pick up reconstructive teleporting, you don't actually NEED either bay. This actually enables you to have 1 more offensive system than any other ships, because the medbay counts towards your major system limit. While the Stormwalked sucks most of the time, it's got potential to be feared.  As far as standard play, I find that the SM involves a lot of pausing. I would typically give my crewmembers an edge by bombing the room that they were fighting in (with as many enemy crew as possible) and then running out and back in for a brief moment JUST as the bomb explodes. This technique also works very nicely with stunning weaponry if you can time it right."
ftlgame,3d1dyw,crushfan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:34:51 2015 UTC,"I spent the past few hours trying to win with Slug B and this advice helped me quite a bit. I managed to get a Rockman and a Mantis and had them be my boarding team. Within sector 2 I managed to get Reconstructive TP and didn't really need a medbay after that; you have the heal bomb to start with which helped me when things got bad.   I ended up buying a clone bay with backup DNA and it helped me on the flagship but went unnoticed the rest of the run. With that said, saving the system slot for something else is probably a good idea. I probably would have done that as well but I relied on my boarding team pretty much until sector 6, and i was terrified of potentially losing my entire offensive edge. I also suck with Hacking and Mind Control and pretty much use them only to counter enemy hack and MC.   P.S: Vulcan is really really bad when you have Cloaking but no Stealth Weapons. RIP The StormFocker"
ftlgame,3d1dyw,Leylite,3,Wed Jul 15 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"Here's a few tips with the Stormwalker that really make the difference (and are quite handy even if you're playing a more conventional ship like the Gila Monster):   In the early sectors, enemy ships will only have 2 or 3 crew, so you can often get the enemy crew to switch places by moving your crew back and forth between Shields and some other rooms. This can allow you to get 2v1 fights for a little while on ships where piloting is far away from Shields, and it also makes the ship unpiloted for a little while which will help your missiles and healing bursts hit (although it's not a guarantee, watch out for level 2 auto-piloting). Pick your boarding targets carefully. Usually it's good to board directly onto a crewed room so you get a few 2v1 hits in before a second crewman arrives. It's definitely worthwhile to 2v1 a Mantis as much as you can. Take advantage of Rockmen's slowness too, whenever you can. If the enemy ship can't hurt you, or their weapons are down and you can keep them from repairing them, then you have a free license to board with your third Slug (or anybody else you have; Engi can help out too!) Sometimes you can board weapons, then fire an Artemis missile at weapons and have your crew leave just before it hits (although this is very risky). When successful, your crew get out unscathed, the weapons room gets hit, and two enemy crew in there take 30 damage. This doesn't come into play a lot, but it has saved my bacon once or twice."
ftlgame,3d1dyw,Leylite,2,Sun Jul 12 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"I know most of this tips. Crew switching is pretty usefull, usually I can kill 3 rockmans with only 2 slugs.  What about clonebay/medbay and weapons?  Should I switch my boarding slug with rockman if I can or not?"
ftlgame,3d1dyw,Twinge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:27:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd substitute in a Rockman if you can. Obviously that means you can't kite at all, but the increased offensive potential makes up for it nicely, especially once they're trained. Rockmen are also better at boarding auto-ships than Mantis or Slug are."
ftlgame,3d1dyw,Twinge,3,Sun Jul 12 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"Mastering The Safety Dance is probably the single most important tactic to master for the Slug B - you can drastically increase the odds of the Heal Bomb landing this way as well as getting in more damage against them when they have 3 crew.  Other boarding tactics like The Truffle Shuffle are also very important.  The Slug B is actually a very similar ship to the Mantis A overall, just a little worse.  The Artemis makes a great support weapon to take out Medbays or overly threatening weapons systems and is often worth keeping around for a while.  Clone Bay is indeed superior to Medbay, but either is fine, and getting one fairly quickly does reduce your reliance on missiles sooner (plus you might not see one at the next store you visit)."

ftlgame,3cx977,freeriderau,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:39:04 2015 UTC,"I find that by that point enemies have enough shields and evasion (and potentially cloaking, rarely Defense II or shield overchargers) that you really want to get a second ion weapon or second drone if you're going to be sticking with the shield-ionization strategy. Beyond that, lasers or hacking are also good options.  Enemies also tend to have nasty weapons like Flak II, Hermes/Breach missile, a ton of lasers, or two combat drones, so you need some answer to that, whether it's a defense drone, cloaking, or just a fast enough offense to shut those things down before they're a problem (usually involving some sort of targetted weapon like a Heavy Laser or Hull Smasher Laser).  I've only rarely had Ion Blast II + Halberd Beam go well, and that's been when I got one of them for free when I already had 6 weapon power.  Boarders aren't usually a problem due to the good venting layout, but boarding drones, ion intruders and event-boarders can be enough of a problem that you might want to get Doors level 2 by sector 5 if you're entering either a Rebel, Zoltan or Rock sector.

Using all of your crew, you should be able to teleport into the drone bay and force his crew to retreat to the medbay, at which point you can start damaging it.  When you damage it all the way down, you'd do a single point of damage.  Wait for his crew to repair it and then repeat.  Slowly and tediously you should be able to whittle him down to one HP.  Then teleport your crew to the shield bay, which he will defend before the drone bay.  Have a sacrificial lamb go to the drone bay to start attacking it and (hopefully) do the one last point of damage.  The timing and patience for this will be tricky at best.  Another possible solution is to send your two of your crew to the pilot and then space the rest of your crew out in the hallways to the medbay.  Hopefully you can pick them off while they run back to heal.  Once you kill off the entire crew, the AI will start to fix itself, allowing you to do as much damage as you want.  Either way, it's not a great position you're in.  You will have to deal with the super shield in round 3 :-("

ftlgame,3cy1y9,samtheredditman,4,Sat Jul 11 22:11:36 2015 UTC,Had the exact same thing happen recently. Just keep your engine doors closed with O2 in them and the boarders will leave the clone bay to get to the oxygenated room. Then open the engine room and they will suffocate without being able to make it back to clone bay and kill it before they die.

ftlgame,3cy3l5,Leylite,5,Sat Jul 11 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"To explain what's going on in this screenshot:   I started a new game with the Engi B. My first jump takes me to a standard Rebel fight, which spawned this enemy ship. (Uh oh, this looks scary.) It hacks my weapons. (Wow, that's pretty bad.) Things are actually pretty fine for the first 15 seconds or so - the combat drone (hidden under the Pause text in this screenshot), basic laser and beams just hit empty rooms, Medbay and Doors. My first Heavy Ion shot misses. (This is where the color drains out of me and I silently reflect on the fact that I am not a praying man.) Shields get damaged, and shortly afterwards Weapons takes a hit.  I take a screenshot.   Suffice to say that after the screenshot got taken, piloting and engines got damaged (notably, Piloting gets lit on fire) before I could jump away, shields got hit again, eventually my repair drones got destroyed (!) and I died. I'm not even particularly angry at this, just sort of bemused.  I think the only thing different I could have done would have been to have my Engi abandon piloting and help fix shields as soon as they got hit, but I did manage to get the 10% evasion to proc once beforehand and I was trying to charge the FTL drive to jump away."
ftlgame,3cy3l5,panda44444,3,Sat Jul 11 20:50:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure if you could have done anything differently. It is incredible how bad this game is at letting the player know what he did wrong. I've tried recording runs to see, but it is hard to rewatch a long run that I know is going to end in defeat. :/  I had a similar experience with the Mantis B on the second jump. Shields got hit, and then piloting and engines. It all went downhill after that. It was on the 10th game or so in a win streak too, so it was very annoying. :("
ftlgame,3cy3l5,battlecatluke1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"It's just the nature of the game. If you get hit on a key system at the wrong time, a crappy automated scout can screw you over completely."
ftlgame,3cy3l5,thettttman,3,Sat Jul 11 23:23:09 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not quite that simple - very rarely will one battle screw you over completely like I'm showing off here. Once you survive the first couple of battles (which are rarely this horrifying), you can get upgrades like 1.5 shields, 2 shields, more engines, piloting, weapons buffer, etc. that all make you way less likely to die.  The first jump is just the most vulnerable time because you start with so little."
ftlgame,3cy3l5,ais523,3,Sat Jul 11 23:30:41 2015 UTC,"It's far worse with some ships than others as well. It's hard to imagine any way that (eg.) Zoltan A or B could ever get something like this, even at the first jump, while in Stealth B or C, it's almost common (though what you said about upgrades still applies)."
ftlgame,3cy3l5,thettttman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:37:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you can be up against a Beam Drone II at the first jump, but that would probably be able to beat a Zoltan B by itself if it hit weapons on its fourth attack (the first three would take down the Zoltan shield). Add in the fact that the enemy might have other weapons too, and I can easily see an unavoidable death (it's certainly possible to lose engines/piloting before your FTL charges in this setup)."

This drawing is the Captain of the Kestrel, in uniform. I went with an more realistic/tactical style influenced by the armor and gear worn by modern day infantry, and some old art from the game's development that depicts the human crew in more detail: https://i.imgur.com/bH20zF2.png  This was drawn using a 1.3mm mechanical pencil with B-grade graphite, on A4-sized printer paper.

ftlgame,3cw1m4,UndersizedPotato,3,Sat Jul 11 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"Use drones to help you - it starts with a drone system for free. A hull repair is useful for repairing in between fights, and defence drones can save you sometimes. I highly recommend getting cloaking as it's really useful for avoiding the power surges.  Apart from this just pray to RNGesus that you get a good loadout"
ftlgame,3cw1m4,LucasTyph,3,Sat Jul 11 11:58:50 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're using The Torus (Engi A). That ship starts with an Ion Blast II (one of the best ion weapons in the game) and a combat drone for damage. In the very beginning it's quite easy to just turn on autofire and let your drone do the damage. When you start facing enemies with two shields, though, your weapon will take longer to take the shields down, so you need something else: at that point you need to save some scrap and go to a store so you can buy a weapon, because otherwise you're going to face some problems.  The other thing you need to be careful with is your drone parts. If you run out, you won't be able to use your drones, so watch out and find a way to stop relying on drones before that happens.  Other than that, you just need to play like any other ship. If you're having difficulties with the game in general, there are many useful guides in the sidebar that are extremely helpful."
ftlgame,3cw1m4,LucasTyph,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:28:40 2015 UTC,So do you recommend to get more drones and ion weapons (and a weapon if I have more scrap?)
ftlgame,3cw1m4,samtheredditman,2,Sat Jul 11 16:07:01 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a viable strategy, so yes. The problem is that your loadout in FTL is basically controlled by the RNG, so it's possible that you won't find an ion weapon or other combat drones in a run. Sometimes you'll have to change your strategy and adapt to what you're given and what you can buy in stores."
ftlgame,3cw1m4,Leylite,2,Sat Jul 11 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"The main thing your ship NEEDS in FTL is a way to do damage to enemy ships. It's arguably the most important thing to think about when playing.   When you start facing enemies with level 2 shields, you'll have to hit 3 shots in row with your ion blast 2 to take their shields down. Because the enemies are going to have a dodge chance, you end up relying on luck to get their shields offline. So finding a weapon that will allow you to get through their shields and do damage is very important with that particular ship."
ftlgame,3cw1m4,51Gunner,3,Sat Jul 11 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"I definitely recommend getting another weapon in the early game, so that you can apply targetted damage to a single room and don't have to rely on the drone (if it's just shooting random rooms that you don't care about, or if the enemy has an anti-drone). A heavy laser or hull laser works great for this, but a pike/hull beam or conventional laser can work fine too.  Other than that, it's pretty much a ship meant to have a strong enough defense to live through the first enemy volley, but completely lock down the enemy ship if the player can stay in the fight long enough."
ftlgame,3cw1m4,BepisChristmas,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"Try to find a second weapon for it as soon as reasonably possible. Ion Blast 2 is pretty damn good at taking shields down (until the enemy gets good evasion), but the Combat drone isn't the best. It can deal a respectable amount of raw damage but it is bad at knocking out dangerous enemy systems - an important part of minimizing attrition.   Something like a Heavy Laser 1 works wonders - that 2 damage punch with a good chance of breach, fire, or stun complements the shield-stripping Ion really well."
ftlgame,3cupvu,LVDirtlawyer,10,Fri Jul 10 22:51:42 2015 UTC,My question is.. why havent you powered that Flak yet?
ftlgame,3cupvu,AgCat1340,2,Sat Jul 11 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"It's weird, I feel like I never run into ships like this in the late game where they belong. I've definitely seen way too many before sector 5, though.  If you haven't gone ahead and fought this ship yet, I'd power down the heavy laser and O2 for the flak. You'll have a much easier time getting through the shields and doing damage. Once weapons are fully down you can switch the burst laser for the heavy. You might get lucky and cause some hull breaches or fires (although you won't have any immediate way to know whether or not a fire gets started).  Edit: The DD2 might also be helpful if you had some spare power or even a backup battery, but you're probably safer just keeping your shields and dodge as high as possible.  Another edit: Just realized these guys were getting ready to board you right when you took this, too... that's rough. If you haven't died yet, As soon as two or all of their weapons are down, drop some engine power and power your anti-personnel drone. Vent shields right away to keep them away from that room. If your drone catches the boarders in a room that isn't occupied by a crew member, vent it as well. Open every single door that isn't connected to weapons, engines or piloting to drain oxygen as quickly as possible. And in the future, upgrade doors earlier. Like, as early as you can after getting the second shield and maybe some engines. That should always be a priority unless most of your crew is good at combat or your ship starts with L2 doors."
ftlgame,3cupvu,BepisChristmas,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:42:28 2015 UTC,"I know the pain, I once ran into a ship in sector 2 with a zoltan shield, a glaive beam and another small weapon on normal, it was gg for me."

ftlgame,3cvl3j,Sproutedonthenumber9,9,Sat Jul 11 03:31:30 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of subtle differences in difficulty level - this is one of them.  The basics are lower scrap income and more difficult enemy loadouts, but it also affects AI system manning order, presence of Zoltan Shields in Sector 1, starting scrap, door strength, number of drones in the power surge, and the AI's targeting preferences.  I haven't yet tested in AE to determine if Hard targeting is different from Normal, but I can confirm both fro personal testing and from dev statement that in Normal they are more likely to target important rooms than on Easy.  Maybe this should be the next Tips & Tricks video; I've been slacking."
ftlgame,3cvl3j,Twinge,2,Sat Jul 11 08:55:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't know it was so many differences. I'm not sure where I got the idea that it was just reduced scrap, maybe I just never read the tool tip right. Either way, it certainly doesn't go into that much depth."
ftlgame,3cvl3j,BepisChristmas,3,Sat Jul 11 08:59:48 2015 UTC,"I remember reading somewhere that the RNG in hard mode is weighted such that important rooms like weapons and shields are, in fact, more likely to be targeted by enemy weapons (Edit: It may also have simply been that system rooms are more likely to be targeted than empty rooms). So you aren't just noticing patterns that aren't there or anything like that.   I think rooms targeted by hacking, mind control, and teleportation are always uniformly random, however. I may be wrong about that."
ftlgame,3cvl3j,BepisChristmas,2,Sat Jul 11 03:52:45 2015 UTC,"The amount of time I've played on hard, I am happy to say, with greater than a 95% certainty that shields, weapons etc get hit more than empty spaces.

ftlgame,3cvy5f,SomethingWittyUrl,3,Sat Jul 11 05:51:05 2015 UTC,"You'll probably want to go for Phase Shift and Tactical Approach, because Bird of Prey is easiest to unlock with Stealth B.  For Tactical Approach, hang on to your Long-Range Scanners for the first seven sectors. Don't sell them unless the very last beacon you can jump to before leaving sector 7 is a store. Sometimes RNG will screw you over and you'll be in a position where you can only jump to hazardous beacons. Try to take paths where the beacons you'll visit have lots of neighbors, to give yourself more options. The only beacons you need to avoid are asteroid fields, suns, pulsars and ion storms. The first two are common in Rock sectors, and ion storms are more common in nebula and Zoltan sectors, so avoid those sectors if you can (I don't know if there is any one sector type where pulsars are more common). ASBs are not counted as hazards, so as long as you don't die those are okay to jump to.  The hardest part of Phase Shift is really just making it to the flagship's last phase. You should be able to unlock this one by simply cloaking the laser power surge. If you encounter a ship before then that's armed to the teeth with burst lasers and flak, you can unlock it if it fires enough weapons in sync and you cloak. This is harder to do than it should be, though, since enemy ships never intentionally sync their weapons.  Generally the hardest part of the stealth ship achievements is surviving, because the early game can be brutal without shields."
ftlgame,3cvy5f,BepisChristmas,3,Sat Jul 11 06:34:55 2015 UTC,"Rock sectors tend to have more environmental hazards in general, so I would recommend avoiding those if possible.  Also, generally if a beacon is marked with an Anti-Ship Battery, but has not been taken over by the Rebel Fleet, it is generally safe to go to, as you are basically guaranteed an easy fight. (These beacons have their ASBs aimed at the enemy, not you.) Although, if I recall correctly, such beacons tend to only be found in Abandoned Sectors, which are quite difficult and probably should be avoided.  Other than that, good luck to you. Once you get the Stealth B, a couple of tips that will help you greatly:   Your first upgrade should be to upgrade your cloaking to Level 3. Once you do this, at the beginning of every fight, cloak first, then use the glaive beam. Consider getting hacking around Sector 3-4, if you don't have new weaponry by then. Hacking shields can allow you to both use the full damage potential of the glaive beam and off-set the Stealth B's mid-game weakness. (Difficulty damaging ships due to multiple shield bubbles that the glaive beam can't pierce through, while not having the scrap to upgrade the weapons system to augment the glaive beam with other shield-busting weaponry.)"
ftlgame,3cvy5f,Tehpillowstar,3,Sat Jul 11 14:10:24 2015 UTC,"You can unlock Bird of Prey fairly easily with Stealth A if you switch the difficulty to Easy Mode, then play a new game, upgrade cloaking to level 3 in the first sector, then look around for an unshielded auto-scout with only five health. (In harder difficulties, ships have slightly more hull points so you'll tend to see auto-scouts with six or seven health instead.)  Note that for the achievement to trigger, you must cloak, destroy the ship, its destruction animation must finish, and you have to see the rewards screen while your ship is still cloaked."

ftlgame,3cviue,AgCat1340,6,Sat Jul 11 03:09:33 2015 UTC,"A suggestion: hack the Shields room the next time. The Flagship has really bad dodge % in the first phase (something like 15% if memory serves). By bringing down the shields with hacking you could pound probably five of the six burst lasers into one of the weapons and board the other.  Also, I'd recommend prioritizing the boss's weapons as follows: Missiles, Ion, Beam, Laser. The Beam weapon isn't particularly dangerous if the Ion's not suppressing your shields.   If you've got the boarding team for it, the flagship's weapons (except for laser) in phase 1 and then try to rack up as many crew kills as you can. Using Hacking on shields will trap an enemy in there, incapable of running away to the medbay. The Breach 2 is a great finisher."
ftlgame,3cviue,51Gunner,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:08:49 2015 UTC,"A good way i know of getting rid of the crew easily is by hacking the medbay, damaging it, locking someone in there then activating the hack. When the people in the room are dead, unpower the hack to unlock the doors to let others in."
ftlgame,3cviue,SomethingWittyUrl,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"Hacking missiles and then sending your crew into the middle room was a waste of your hack. As has already been stated, it would be better served on shields sho that you can take down their hacking (only if it's actually a problem) or their cloaking so that you can continue to damage the flagship. A breach bomb into a weapons room would also stop that weapon for a while since he'd have to repair the breach first"

There are three times you're most likely to die in FTL when you're experienced enough to be trying a win streak - first, deaths in sector 1 or 2 to abnormally dangerous ships, when your own ship is weak and you haven't gotten a lot of scrap to upgrade it yet; second, deaths in sector 4 or 5 due to ""fizzling out"" by not having a strong enough start or a good transition to the middle-game, and running into an abnormally dangerous ship that counters your setup and makes your life miserable (this includes slowly dying to missile chip damage and not being able to repair at a store before that happens); and third, the Flagship.  This game definitely exhibits the ""unstable equilibrium"", because the better a start you have, the better chance you have of doing great later on. There are some ""catch-up"" mechanics in place like events giving you free crew, free weapons, etc. but that merely helps out a run that's been crawling along, and gives even more scrap to a run that's already doing great (and doesn't rubber-band at all).  However, that said, you don't need a great start to win with most ships - it's possible to come back from a heck of a lot in this game."

At the start of the game, it has no way to beat a Zoltan shield and almost no way to beat an autoship (its choices are sacrificing a crewmember and Crystal Vengeance). If your win rate is low, it's a good ship to bring your winrate up, but if your winrate is already very high (not me yet, but some players are there), I'd expect it to be one of the more difficult ones because the first few beacons are often one of the hardest parts of the game."

ftlgame,3csudk,Jimli_,2,Fri Jul 10 17:22:02 2015 UTC,That's a very small crew especially be using boarding too. Did you lose a few earlier in the battle?
ftlgame,3csudk,Foggalong,2,Fri Jul 10 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"I know, I was actually surprised that I managed to do it with such little crew. I went into the first stage with only four crew members not expecting to win and lost my one mantis on the first stage through boarding."
ftlgame,3csxy4,battlecatluke1,3,Fri Jul 10 14:52:06 2015 UTC,"Most importantly, upgrade your oxygen system so you don't die an embarrassing death by suffocation in case the Flagship hacks it (a level 2 system refills the oxygen quickly enough to counter any oxygen loss from the hacking pulse).   Also, swap the positions of the Dual Laser and the Lockdown Bomb, the latter won't do so much as you don't have a teleporter. You can use it to prevent/slow the enemy crew from repairing the shields though.  Hack shields, destroy cloaking and shields (and the missiles, if you feel like it). Level 2 cloak the missiles in phase 1, level 1 cloak the power surges in phases 2 and 3. Might also want to destroy the engines or piloting after destroying shields in phase 3 since the evasion is pretty high there."
ftlgame,3csxy4,corvid_,3,Fri Jul 10 18:50:46 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you have this battle easily.  For this battle, I'd swap the placement of your last two weapons.  Lockdown won't help you very much compared to Dual Lasers.  I'd also upgrade O2 (to buy time if its hacked) and medbay (to give yourself a damage buffer/faster healing).  Obviously, focus on taking down their missiles first.  If you wanted to kill the crew, you could hack 02, and keep it down with laser fire - Lockdown bomb would also be helpful in keeping crew out of that room.  For the future, generally don't put mantis permanently manning piloting or engines.  He needs to deal with boarders, and he's slow at repairs."
ftlgame,3csxy4,chewbacca77,2,Fri Jul 10 14:59:22 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks! Also, I have a Hull Laser in my storage, should I swap that out for anything?"

ftlgame,3csxy4,SmartAlec105,2,Fri Jul 10 15:25:38 2015 UTC,I believe the Flagship has high enough O2 to counter hacking.
ftlgame,3csxy4,superfantastic1,3,Fri Jul 10 16:23:11 2015 UTC,I think what the strategy is to hack 02 then destroy the system. I personally think it's a bad strategy since medbay is just outside and you'll end up killing the guy Manning lasers. Hacking medbay and damaging the room is probably easier overall.
ftlgame,3csxy4,chewbacca77,2,Fri Jul 10 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"If you're playing on hard mode, its still better to kill all the crew."
ftlgame,3csxy4,superfantastic1,2,Fri Jul 10 17:13:00 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. If possible, would you leave one alive? Sounds like phases two and maybe three would be much easier with only the piloting bonus."
ftlgame,3csxy4,chewbacca77,2,Fri Jul 10 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"It would be best to leave one crew member alive if possible.  With no crew, all systems get repaired slowly and simultaneously.  And more importantly, all systems get a manning bonus."
ftlgame,3csxy4,Luigigames,3,Fri Jul 10 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"this will be quite easy. it's an amazing setup.  drones would make it easier, especially defense ones."
ftlgame,3csxy4,51Gunner,2,Fri Jul 10 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"Upgrade O2 so the RNG can't kill you by hacking it in phase 1. Also, move your Engi to manning doors before phase 3 - he's no good in a fight, but slowing down boarders could make a big difference.   I'm not a fan of Lockdown bombs and probably wouldn't have kept it, but because you're rocking it now you might as well try to sabotage repairs with it."

ftlgame,3crbp1,Shiepdawg,5,Fri Jul 10 06:15:24 2015 UTC,Some of the data in the wiki is incorrect. I'll probably gonna have to fix that.
ftlgame,3crbp1,ChummyCommie,5,Fri Jul 10 07:32:54 2015 UTC,Small note: breach/fire chance on beams is rolled for each tile the beam hits. That makes the effective fire chance for beams much higher.
ftlgame,3crbp1,sleeper_service_CE,2,Fri Jul 10 11:41:32 2015 UTC,How about the fire bomb / stun chances with multiple crewmen?
ftlgame,3crbp1,mekloz,2,Fri Jul 10 11:55:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about that one. Bombs seem to cause multiple fires more often, but I have no real data on that. Honestly I'm not even sure how spawning multiple fires on impacts works in general. Obviously the game does not allow multiple breaches to be spawned by the same impact. But I'm pretty sure a laser shot, bombs or missile can spawn multiple fires. Can they? There is a possibility that all weapons actually roll fire chance for each tile of the room they hit. If that is true then firing on a four tile room would increase fire chance."
ftlgame,3crbp1,sleeper_service_CE,3,Fri Jul 10 12:08:46 2015 UTC,"Fire bomb has firechance 10 (100%, I think), but randomly creates 1 or 2 fires, maybe more. So it's more like there's some hidden chance for a number of fires.  I'm sure I've seen only some of the crew in the room get stunned, but the stun bomb/ion always stuns everyone, so it's different there. @edit There's a separate line for stun and stunchance, never mind.  Thinking about making a laser have 100% chance fire and checking how it behaves. Maybe the same with the fire beam, too."
ftlgame,3crbp1,mekloz,2,Fri Jul 10 12:18:47 2015 UTC,"Bombs seem to cause multiple fires more often   I've seen lasers causing multiple fires just as often as bomb does.     There is a possibility that all weapons actually roll fire chance for each tile of the room they hit.   I don't think so. I've never seen a projectile weapon spawns more than 2 fires in a single room. I believe that when fires is spawned on impact, the game randomly spawns either 1 or 2 fires regardless of the weapon's fire chance."

ftlgame,3cpbe5,mymindpsychee,7,Fri Jul 10 00:03:25 2015 UTC,I think it's just a massively scaled up version of the Heavy Laser. Laser can be made to pierce shield like the one equipped on the Shivan.
ftlgame,3cpbe5,ChummyCommie,3,Thu Jul 9 18:17:21 2015 UTC,It might be counted as an environmental disaster. Unless Solar Flares and Pulsars are just special fire and ion bombs.
ftlgame,3cpbe5,SmartAlec105,9,Thu Jul 9 19:08:32 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing the point here. I'm talking about what the ASB is in the FTL universe. Though funny enough, it actually does have a weapon blueprint, and it uses the Heavy Laser as its template. Environmental disasters like Solar Flares however does not."
ftlgame,3cpbe5,ChummyCommie,7,Thu Jul 9 19:35:31 2015 UTC,"Head canon warning.  I don't have any real evidence for this, it just makes sense to me. The missiles pierce the shield because they are high velocity tiny objects, too small and fast for the shield to react and stop them. This explains why the overshield stops them (it acts as an actual one way physical barrier) but the normal shields don't.  Following this logic, the ASB is just a planetary sized railgun, which takes a small (relative to an asteroid) slug and accelerates it to near light speed. At this velocity, the signal from the computer to reinforce the shield in that location cannot get there before the slug has already passed through the ship.  The asparagus apparatus* for such a weapon would have to be huge, and the kick (f12=f21, equal and opposite forces) would launch a small ship like the kestrel into another system.   At least that's how I see it.  Edit damn autocorrect making me hungry."
ftlgame,3cpbe5,TimLearyzMajik,3,Thu Jul 9 20:35:02 2015 UTC,But lasers move faster than missiles. I think it's the opposite. It pierces because it is a low velocity massive object (so are the crystal weapons). They slip through the shield rather than breaking it with the energy in the lasers.   which takes a small (relative to an asteroid) slug and accelerates it to near light speed   Why would they do that to a poor slug ;_; /u/dirtytabs won't be pleased.
ftlgame,3cpbe5,SmartAlec105,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:05:06 2015 UTC,"But lasers are energy, and could just be grounded out or redirected to a non-damaging circuit.  In the head canon I described, the two major threats to the ships are large slow objects (asteroids, flak, etc) and energy weapons (lasers and beams). These are the two strengths of the shield, grounding out energy weaponry with a reset time built in for large spikes (not unlike a circuit breaker) and it can be focused to redirect large slow objects via force.  The issue with missiles being large is that we have to be able to carry hundreds of them on the kestrel and compare them to the asteroids that bounce off."
ftlgame,3cpbe5,TimLearyzMajik,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:17:12 2015 UTC,Refer to the Stargat SG-1 episode where they use a bow to penetrate Apophis' personal shield.
ftlgame,3cpbe5,aresius,4,Fri Jul 10 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"My headcanon is that it's some kind of super-flak that stays together well enough to pierce shields. It's a weapon that's impractical to mount on anything smaller than a planet. The rebels have built some specialized ships to carry them which they use for planetary sieges, but these ships are crippled by being entirely dedicated to supporting the cannon.  When the Rebel Fleet catches you, these ships start firing on you while the rest hang back to defend them. They're worried that if they chase you, you might loop around and smash the vulnerable artillery ships. For your part, you're trying to flee and are too smart to engage the bulk of the fleet in close combat."
ftlgame,3cpbe5,51Gunner,2,Thu Jul 9 21:13:50 2015 UTC,All you can take from what is said in the game is that it's a weapon made to pierce the hull. There's no information given about how it works/what it's made of etc.
ftlgame,3cpbe5,LucasTyph,2,Thu Jul 9 18:37:05 2015 UTC,Anti-Ship Battery is my guess.
ftlgame,3cpbe5,panthyren,3,Thu Jul 9 18:19:08 2015 UTC,"...yeah, I know that. I mean what is the anti ship battery itself. What does it shoot? What is it in the FTL universe?"
ftlgame,3cpbe5,itsamamaluigi,6,Thu Jul 9 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"I'll take a wild guess and say they are some sort of ultra-high-speed projectile, like a railgun.  The projectile it fires ignores all shields and causes hull breaches. This makes me think it's a physical object. The appearance is just a yellowish-white blob, which could represent a projectile of metal that is glowing white-hot from being accelerated to near the speed of light. ASBs can be fired from planets or from large cruisers but don't appear on any small ships - makes me think that in the FTL universe, these railguns are too large to fit on small ships.  Then again, in writing this I realized that shields protect against flak as well as lasers and beams, despite it being a physical object... so now I don't know what to believe."
ftlgame,3cpbe5,geckos100,2,Thu Jul 9 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"That's what I first thought too, but then like you said shields protect against flak and asteroids.    /u/geckos100 said it as well, but I think that the reason missiles go through shields is because they have some sort of shield phasing device.  Missiles are big enough to hold the fuel, warhead, and a guidance system, so why not a shield piercing device?"
ftlgame,3cpbe5,samtheredditman,3,Thu Jul 9 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"Perhaps missiles are equipped with a small shield hacking device? That would make sense given their price.  Considering the piercing power of a modern rail gun, I'm sure one of the future could pierce the energy shields of FTL, particularly considering those shields tend to act as more of a weak shell than anything else. (low velocity asteroids can break a layer)  This theory would be more credible if ABS actually took down shields too."
ftlgame,3cpbe5,SmartAlec105,2,Thu Jul 9 19:27:00 2015 UTC,"An asteroid hitting a ship in space would be a ridiculous amount of power, not just a little dink on the hood like the game depicts."
ftlgame,3cpbe5,Luigigames,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:57:53 2015 UTC,It could be the shape of the missile which allows it to pierce the shield rather than slam against it like the flak gun's projectiles. That'd explain why it seems to be aerodynamically designed when it is only used in space.
ftlgame,3cpbe5,LVDirtlawyer,2,Thu Jul 9 22:06:47 2015 UTC,"ASB (anti-ship battery) has a weapon blueprint that counts it as a laser and the name is PDS_SHOT. the description says ""YOU SHOULD NEVER SEE THIS"". it actually does fire the ASB shot. the ASB itself though is actually a mounted super laser cannon that fires on whatever target, should it be mounted on a cruiser or planet. most of the time, the rebels will have a cruiser with one. in a nebula, they cannot target anything, which is why it's better to fight the fleet within the nebula if you have to or you wanna rack up score.  CE has a similar artillery weapon called the PDS (planetary defense system). as for the ASB, it's simply a super laser artillery that will pierce shields as well as cause a breach and 3 damage.  sounds more like a breach missile to me but it is not a missile."

ftlgame,3cnqnw,UndersizedPotato,2,Thu Jul 9 15:04:49 2015 UTC,"Copypastaed from one of my previous posts on unlocking Rock B:  Obviously, the two achievements that aren't Ancestry are the easiest to unlock, and you should try and get those first. They're fairly simple to complete if you know what you're doing. Here's how I unlocked mine:  Is it warm in here? Since the person you're killing whilst on fire has to stay in one space (not leave the room that they're in), hacking and fire bombs/beams are your friend. Since hacking locks down the room that it's affecting, lock down a room with a single person in it (Piloting is a good one for this), fire bomb/beam them, and teleport your Rock/Mantis/whatever into the room and beat them to a pulp. Crystal Lockdown/the Crystal special ability works too, apparently (not that I'd know, the fucking elusive Crystal cruiser I have yet to chance upon hasn't reared its ugly head yet).  Defence Drones Don't Do D'Anything/Rain of Missiles I happened to chance upon a ship with a defence drone in an asteroid field when I unlocked this achievement. If RNGesus blesses you with such luck you can time your missile shots to fire at the same time so the defence drone shoots down only one, first taking out their shield then the drone system itself. If you don't find it in an asteroid field, still time your shots, but make sure (if you're using the stock loadout of Artemis/Hull Missile) that your Artemis is the one that gets shot down (firing the two missiles with about a half second of delay usually allows for this) so your Hull Missile can target, well, the hull. The quicker you destroy the ship, the better. Alternatively, the Defence Scrambler augmentation works wonders, allowing you to take down those pesky Defence Drone-ed ships with ease."
ftlgame,3cnglz,Braver_Incident,7,Thu Jul 9 07:14:20 2015 UTC,"I know you can drastically increase ship hull if desired, so that could potentially offer a similar effect.  Best way to find out for sure is to just try it, though I suspect it only works in integers."
ftlgame,3cnglz,Twinge,4,Thu Jul 9 07:55:10 2015 UTC,Just tested for you; decimal hull damage/system damage/crew damage/fire chance/breach chance all round down. Didn't test Ion but I can't imagine it's different.
ftlgame,3cnglz,Kittsy,2,Thu Jul 9 11:22:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I guess the only alternative would be multipled all hull health?"
ftlgame,3cnglz,Leylite,3,Thu Jul 9 15:39:27 2015 UTC,"That would work for lasers and missiles, but beams are pretty heavily tied into the current hull and shield levels of the game - you can't double hull and double beam damage because that means beams can pierce shields better.  Systems getting destroyed due to sabotage or fire are always hard-coded to do 1 hull damage, so if you double ship hull strength to 60 points then you're halving the effect that that damage has.  Additionally, all the events in the game that repair hull (or damage it) repair an absolute amount, not a relative percentage, so by doubling hull strength you'd halve the effects of all that as well."

Still, there's the Captain's Edition Infinite Addon, that does it with the CE stuff.  As for new mods, I don't remember any good ones from this year; all the ones I have are from 2014."

ftlgame,3cmg9z,OurEngiFriend,6,Thu Jul 9 01:33:24 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't recommend running CE Infinite with Endless Loot. CE Infinite (which is endless gameplay) is good enough for me; trying to run Endless Loot is pretty damn difficult and resorts to tricks like manually increasing java heap space and using external tools to increase FTL's RAM space. Unless you have a really good machine, FTL just is not built to handle that many weapons. As stylesrj put it: trying to run Endless Loot is like building a nuclear reactor to power a toaster--it's too much power into one appliance which wasn't built to handle that much input, and you'll never use the reactor for anything else.  That out of the way... The ""endless"" mods I know of are CE Infinite Space, and the original Infinite Space.   CE-Inf is part of CE (obviously), which adds new events and ships, sector types and hazards, and new weapons--the sheer amount of variety is exciting, but some would say that the weapons there aren't particularly balanced. CE-Inf adds infinite sector-jumping, along with a way to get back to the ""main campaign"" (by jumping back into the main sectors from infinite space), but also comes with dramatically more expensive system costs.   CE as a whole is also a league more difficult than standard FTL--some would say this is by intent, others would say this is because CE is poorly balanced. I think it's somewhere between the two, to be honest. If you do run CE, you may (or may not?) want to run slowriderxcorps' SM Polish Kit, which is an attempt at rebalancing the content in CE. (To be honest, I haven't playtested the SM Polish Kit, and my idea of balancing the CE weapons is different anyway so I probably wouldn't agree with some of the changes present, but you'll have to experiment for yourself.)  In contrast, the original Infinite Space is abandoned but functional. It adds a handful of rare weapons, which are all more powerful versions of existing weapons--think like...legendary weapons, sorta thing. Infinite Space runs forever until you die, unlike CE-Inf which lets you defeat the final boss if you want. Infinite Space also has decent system costs, and is generally easier compared to CE-Inf. However, the enemies you encounter will sometimes be minibosses, which can be pretty difficult. An important thing to note is that Infinite Space hasn't been updated to AE, meaning that no enemies will have AE systems like Hacking and Mind Control, or AE weapons like Flak. Infinite Space can still be run with AE, but only the player will receive the benefits of AE's additions.  One last note: CE-Inf and Infinite Space are mutually incompatible. You cannot run both of them at the same time.  As for new mods released in the last 6 months, you can check the Master Mod List, updated for AE. Being a whore, I'm also going to shamelessly plug my own ships, which I think are pretty okay. [My mod hub], which is actually really out of date and I should update it at some point I'm also gonna plug TaxiService's ship mods, for having really nice hull art. Here's one."

ftlgame,3cmg9z,OurEngiFriend,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"Well, if you can get CE-Inf and Endless Loot to run without using external tools, then you're fine. It's using external tools where the problem is--if you increase FTL's RAM and Java's heap space (which as I loosely understand, also takes up some of the computing power), then there might not be enough memory (or something?) left for vital system functions. So it might starting using virtual RAM which is like the hard drive or something? And that's not good.  I dont know computers too well, but there are definitely big problems with using external tools. If you have a good computer then maybe it's not such a problem."

Keeping the Hull Laser II, the Dual Laser and buying the BLI (if you can get enough scrap to buy the two system upgrades as well, maybe after selling the recovery arm if you're late into sector seven and the repair drone). That would be 7 power, and even though the synergy is not amazing, you'd get 7 shots in each volley, which isn't too bad.  If you can find hacking (to take shields down) or mind control (to use with the pilot so your enemy's evasion drops) later on, buying one of them would also help a lot."
ftlgame,3cjwey,LucasTyph,3,Wed Jul 8 14:59:51 2015 UTC,"Alright you have 155 scrap right now. I'd sell the Anti Bio Beam (25 scrap) and the BL3 (47 scrap I think) getting you to 227 scrap total. Get the BL1 from the store (177 scrap left) and equip the hull laser.  Now for me you have two options that both sound viable. Sell the Hull Missile (32 scrap giving you 199) and get the Ion Blast for 30 scrap (169 total). You can then level weapons up to level 7, (cost of 165 scrap leaving you with 4 scrap for a repair i guess) and then you could equip all your weapons.  Or you could keep the hull missile and go to 6 weapon strength and maybe repair a bit more. If you ever get to 8 weapon strength you can use the hull missile for all kinds of stuff."

ftlgame,3cjwey,chewbacca77,2,Wed Jul 8 14:34:37 2015 UTC,"Well in that case, I'd probably go with Hull Laser II, Burst Laser 1, Dual Laser, and Ion Blast I in that order.  Sell everything else.

This is also true for the weapons system, it tops out at 10 for enemies rather than the 8 available to players, which is how you get those Slug or Rebel ships with a ridiculous array of guns.  This is why missiles have a shield piercing value of 5 rather than 4 btw :)"

AI ships don't have fixed values for system power, rather they have a min and max value for each system that is randomly chosen from each time the ship is loaded for an encounter. There are a few enemy ships like this one with shields between levels 2 and 10, so it's possible for it to end up picking 10 (more likely in later sectors)."

In the coding it is possible to have a level 4 and 5 mind control and hacking but level 4 is basicly nothing while level 5 is basically perma-mind control and hacking while cloning is instantaneous.

ftlgame,3ci2od,never_safe_for_life,2,Wed Jul 8 04:18:11 2015 UTC,Does dodge go down to zero for ships that have multiple levels of piloting? Or does it just drop way down?
ftlgame,3ci2od,BepisChristmas,2,Wed Jul 8 22:39:35 2015 UTC,"If you're mind-controlling the pilot, then the autopilot level determines how much evasion is lost after the manning bonus. If they have L2 or L3 piloting, you'll have to damage the engines or (ideally) the piloting system to drop their evasion further.  Hacking piloting or engines will always drop evasion to 0% for the duration of the hack. On top of that, manning bonuses are lost while the drone is receiving power but not actively hacking the system (this can be seen when your own engines/piloting get hacked)."

ftlgame,3ci2od,BepisChristmas,0,Thu Jul 9 20:45:45 2015 UTC,"That's honestly a pretty tough call, because those are all great weapons. I would probably ditch the Halberd beam, because it has the longest cooldown (I think... I forget how long the Hull 2 takes to charge, but I'm pretty sure it's only slightly slower than BL2).  I wouldn't even worry about the charge ion though. At most it can ionize up to two shields, while the Flak can break through as many as three at once and cools down faster. Plus, it requires too much power to run with your other weapons."

ftlgame,3cd9qv,senor_fox,3,Tue Jul 7 12:31:59 2015 UTC,Heh.  Thanks :)  It took a long time to get a winrate of over 50%...  Then AE came out and plunged it under 50%.  It took awhile to recover from that.
ftlgame,3cd9qv,ChummyCommie,4,Tue Jul 7 12:48:07 2015 UTC,My stats after 192 hours. 36 victories for all this time makes me sad.

ftlgame,3cd9qv,johnratchet3,3,Tue Jul 7 15:23:27 2015 UTC,"157 hours in steam so far and still plenty to play!   For a long time, I mostly played easy.  I unlocked Crystal ships by beating the game with A and B types of all others.  I've since moved up to trying to win with each ship on Normal, and try Hard when I am feeling adventurous (I've only won with Kestral B so far), though interestingly my second highest score is on a failed hard run."
ftlgame,3cd9qv,johnratchet3,2,Tue Jul 7 01:34:46 2015 UTC,I'm going for similar strat. I want to win with everything on normal and later on hard :)
ftlgame,3cd9qv,Kuirem,2,Tue Jul 7 01:39:52 2015 UTC,It certainly extends the life of the game! And sometimes even normal gets too discouraging so its still fun to drop it down to easy and pewpewpew through a run

The Basilisk (Mantis B) is my go-to ship for fun and reliability, and I still have no idea how I managed to get the Mantis C over it as my top legitimate score. There's just so many little tricks and strategies to make boarding the viable answer to every single encounter. Anti personnel drones, clone bays, Lanius ships, even the hardmode flagship, are all just fodder for the Mantis boarding machine."

ftlgame,3c8r3i,cadika_orade,6,Mon Jul 6 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"Jesus man.  Use the teleporter, put to mantis on the Missile Launcher immediately.  Then take out the ion.  Then the beam.

ftlgame,3c8r3i,AgCat1340,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:31:29 2015 UTC,"put to mantis on the Missile Launcher   I have no idea what this means. I don't frequent this sub so you'll have to excuse me if I'm not familiar with the jargon. How do I put to mantis on my missile launcher?  And yes, I get that the objective is to attack and destroy the flagship. What I don't get is how to survive long enough for my weapons to charge. 4 shields barely gave me time to get one round of shots off before I was wasted."
ftlgame,3c8r3i,cadika_orade,3,Mon Jul 6 18:47:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry man I tarded, let me try again.  Use a crew teleporter to teleport two Mantis soldiers (boarding crew) into the bosses missile room, it's the inboard right weapon system.  I suppose you could use any species of boarding crew, but I prefer mantis for quick killin.  The faster you take out those missiles, the less dead you'll become, this is true with weapons or boarding crew, however you do it.  Also what weapons are you using?  Those big fancy ones sometimes aren't worth a damn.  I like a combination of a few smaller ones.  One of the best in the game I think is the Burst Laser II.  2 power, 3 lasers, quick charge.  Also a Flak I is a great weapon.  Breach II or Small bomb can be a great one too."
ftlgame,3c8r3i,AgCat1340,3,Mon Jul 6 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"Just in case you were unaware, all crew (even Engi) destroy systems at the same speed. The only gain you get from using two Mantis in this case is killing the guy manning the system a little bit quicker."
ftlgame,3c8r3i,zztraider,5,Mon Jul 6 21:40:46 2015 UTC,Huh. Imagine that. I still go mantis cause you can hack a room and kill guys before they can get out or others in.
ftlgame,3c8r3i,AgCat1340,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:53:20 2015 UTC,"I usually just wing it. You guys have given me some great advice, so I'll try that out ASAP.  Thanks."
ftlgame,3c8r3i,cadika_orade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"My ideal set up would be engines like 5 or 6, whatever gets you up to 48% dodge with a trained engine and pilot crew. 3 to 4 shield, trained shield man.  Crew Teleporter with trained Mantis crew.  Hacking, even just level 1 is ok.   So that makes... 8 power in shield, 6 in engine, 1 for tele, 1 for hacking, 1 for O2, 1 for med.  18 power so far.  Then weapons- I did it once with 3 flak 1's, thats 6 power.  That machine kicked ass.  It can potentially do 9 damage at once, that is a lot.  And if you take a hit in the weapon bay, you can still probably fire 2 and do 6 damage.  Since I said Ideal, I'd go 2x BLII and a Breach II.  Still 6 power.  The thing with the boss is it's a very procedural fight, it has a pattern and once you learn it, it is easy.  I've been in much harder fights with those fucking drones that have like 2000 dodge.  I've had them take me from near full health to dead on an awesome build in no time.  Sometimes they have just the right set up to buttfuck you quick.  Couple beam drones and some ion cannons, you're toast."
ftlgame,3c8r3i,AgCat1340,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:28:33 2015 UTC,"Forgo the 4th shield for more engine. At a certain point, more engine is better than more shields.   Cloaking- only need level one power to miss shields and have it charge in time for the next round.  Hacking- your choice- shields or engines are the most common.   Teleporter- he was saying teleport two mantis into the missile launcher area"
ftlgame,3c8r3i,shaneathan,2,Mon Jul 6 19:23:42 2015 UTC,"You're correct, except for the Engines over Shields part. L4 Shields will absolutely serve you better in the long run (or more accurately, against the Flagship).  Shields give you more protection overall against the Flagship's ions and heavy lasers; you only need one or two ions to hit (effectively bringing you down to L2 Shields), and then for a single heavy laser to hit, for the Flagship's beam to deal one damage at minimum. Two at minimum if you're temporarily caught Shieldless.  This isn't even counting the equally nasty enemies you could fight which might have a setup like BL2 (x3)/Ion Blast 2, or BL2 (x2)/Hull/Heavy Ion (like my Rock B run last night, which rather dealt my ship with L3 Shields a number).  What's ideal for the Flagship is L4 Shields/L5 Engines, with both personnel obviously maxed out. After that, higher Engines can still be effective, although you get diminishing returns. The fact that L7 costs 80 scrap - equal to L2 Cloaking and L3 Doors/L5 Drone Control - is nothing to minimize.  Well, and Hacking isn't always best gone on Shields or Engines. I typically do Cloaking/Shields, Shields/Piloting, Shields/Mind Control. Plus if you breach or fire in the Piloting room, it'll be more effective overall than a breach or fire in the Engines."
ftlgame,3c8r3i,Tetragoner,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:57:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I'll keep it in mind for my next run.
ftlgame,3c8r3i,cadika_orade,2,Mon Jul 6 19:24:41 2015 UTC,"Boarding strategies (ie., teleporting onto enemy ships and killing all of their crew) are super OP in this game as you get way more scrap for killing the crew than you do for destroying the ship.    Mantis B is probably the strongest ship in the game as it starts with a 4 man teleporter, two mantis crew, two shield bubbles, and a defence drone.  Try a Mantis B run prioritizing getting extra crew members to see what I mean.    You should always try to pick up cloaking before fighting the flag ship as the triple missile will wreck you otherwise."

There were far more problems with the movie but that part didn't help.  Off-topic opinions follow:  IMO Abrams' movies are decent-not-great action movies, and really don't work with the overall philosophy of Star Trek. It's like if you asked a 15-year-old to write a sequel to his favorite movie or TV series and he just throws in a ton of action and fanservice without really understanding why the originals were so good. I spent a lot of time waiting for the action scenes to end so I could see some plot or character development. EDIT: To be fair, most of the older Trek films are the same way, and only the shows and maybe the first movie are really good at capturing that essence.  On the other hand, I'm excited for Abrams to direct Star Wars, because I think his style fits much better with the overall tone of that series."

ftlgame,3cdfqs,destructor_rph,11,Tue Jul 7 01:26:21 2015 UTC,Try to fight as many ships as possible before fighting flagship. They give 40-50 scrap each on normal!
ftlgame,3cdfqs,resont,10,Tue Jul 7 01:32:28 2015 UTC,"This is bad advice, unless you're doing a low scrap run."
ftlgame,3cdfqs,Bigolbillyboy,4,Tue Jul 7 01:33:13 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, in FTL you will come across ships that you can't deal with. And sometimes ships can cripple you by hitting all the worst systems (such as piloting and engines so you can't escape). You can go through the game doing the best that you can but always be able to question your choices, eg, should I have bought this in the shop in sector 3 or something else. FTL is that kind of game. For example, I had a great stealth crusier A run going on (on normal). And then I ran into a ship that didn't have too threatening weapons yet still managed to wreck me due to hitting several key systems and start fires with lasers. Maybe I could have bought different things, but in the end, sometimes this is how things go.  A bit more on topic, in sector 8 you are going to have the toughest fights in general but the scrap rewards are large. It is always risky to ""Defend the outpost"" since you can't see the enemy ship (and therefore his weapons and systems) before engaging. Sometimes it is better to fight if you are confident in your ship and sometimes you need to aviod fighting to not risk losing the run.  Infact, I feel that the random ships can be far more dangerous than the flag ship since with the flag ship (if you play a lot) you will know what is coming so you can plan accordingly."
ftlgame,3cdfqs,Dude579,3,Tue Jul 7 07:35:27 2015 UTC,"No offense, but avoiding those events all the time is actually a terrible idea. The events that involve helping allied ships generally give you good rewards because you get the spoils from the bad guys and (sometimes) a reward from the good guys.   Never refuse to fight a ship until you can actually see what you're up against, because getting scrap is the most important thing. The second most important thing is maintaining enough health that you aren't constantly sinking scrap into repairs. If a ship is too OP for you to fight then you can jump away."
ftlgame,3cdfqs,BepisChristmas,2,Tue Jul 7 18:17:06 2015 UTC,Just pick the one that sounds least likely to end in a dead crewmember and always pick the blue option.
ftlgame,3cdfqs,liltonyabc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:23:33 2015 UTC,Doesn't apply to the Last Stand sector; there are no crew loss events there (of course you can still lose crew in a fight). I don't even think there are any blue options there either.
ftlgame,3cdfqs,itsamamaluigi,3,Tue Jul 7 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"You'd think, but I once got a filler event in the Last Stand. Federation Terraforming Team C12 was busy at work, while their own base was under siege all around them. I got a blue option for sensors.  Seems legit :/"
ftlgame,3cdfqs,dryerlintcompelsyou,2,Tue Jul 7 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is the opposite of correct. You should hit as many beacons as possible before fighting the flagship to maximize scrap gain.  It's important to plan ahead, though. You have to check all the jump beacons to make sure you can reach the base in time and don't take a wrong turn. And you should probably reach the flagship BEFORE it reaches the base, or at the same time. Sometimes in the first phase it will hack an important system (say, weapons) and you'll have to jump away, but if the flagship was already at the base when you arrived, it will destroy the base in the time it takes you to jump away and back.  So. Plan ahead, take the right path, but still hit ~5 beacons before you fight the flagship and you'll get an extra 200-250 scrap, which is really helpful if you want to get that last layer of shields or something."
ftlgame,3cdfqs,itsamamaluigi,2,Tue Jul 7 14:02:45 2015 UTC,"""never do this"" or ""always do this"" advice is generally pretty awful. The game revolves around making intelligent decisions for your situation. Something like this has a lot of variables you aren't accounting for. 1. Do you have systems that still need upgrading? (if so, fighting is often smart) 2. How well repaired is your ship? 3. How strong is your ship against non-bosses? 4. How strong is your ship against bosses? 5. Do you have spare missiles/drones? 6. Do you have repair beacons still remaining that are accessible? 7. If you find a store, could it make a big difference? 8. Have you seen the store? 9. How quickly can you run away from a fight? 10. How do you feel about your personnel?  And more. Unless you address all of those to varying degrees, blanket advice even for something as seemingly simple as the last stand will likely not be useful."

ftlgame,3ccwja,Luigigames,2,Wed Jul 8 00:48:30 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, it's pretty bad to spend scrap on something that you might have use for later. Either something should be immediately useful (like a new augment), or you should be sure you can use it later (like a BL2 in a store - you can plan on upgrading weapons & power to slot it in).  You're missing too many elements of the plan. Also, Lockdown bomb is pretty weak. Lockdown is only useful when you can chain it with multiple crystals. All one bomb can do is give you time to sabotage a system... At a slower cool down than the Small Bomb, which simply damages the system"

When you redownload the game from Steam, it will automatically restore your saves from the Steam Cloud. However, I do not recommend using Steam Cloud. The reason is that FTL does not support Steam Cloud. By enabling Steam Cloud synching for FTL, you are forcing it to do something unintended so it may not work right.   If I talk to some1 in my house to copy all the FTL files with the Internet connection disabled and paste them on my notebook will it work?     What files? The game files or the save files? If it's the game file, you can just redownload it from Steam."

As far as how it works.. whenever you close FTL, it uploads your save to the cloud.  So if you ran FTL while online after your files were gone, chances are it uploaded your new, blank save files."

ftlgame,3c9txq,cathwn,5,Mon Jul 6 09:02:38 2015 UTC,I know! I forgot I had it. It would have been hilariously satisfying to use it just to finish the ship off.
ftlgame,3c9txq,BreeFird,6,Mon Jul 6 14:22:24 2015 UTC,Beams! Beams! Beams! Step right in and see the hottest beam on flagship action this side of the federation!
ftlgame,3c9txq,ChummyCommie,3,Mon Jul 6 06:05:01 2015 UTC,"Looks fun, but too reliance on hacking. By the way, you could've one-shotted the FS's second phase if you cut through 4 rooms with the Glaive."
ftlgame,3c9txq,n_slash_a,3,Mon Jul 6 08:17:38 2015 UTC,"It helped that I found a Flak 1 early on, so I didn't need to rely on hacking to maximize the Glaive's damage for mid-game ships. But by the time I got to sector 8 I pretty much had to beeline for as many repair stations as I could for free drones. I probably would have lost miserably had I been unable to do that.  After I won, I realized I could have killed the second stage in one hit or quickly finished it off with a beam drone. The drone surge was surprisingly ineffective, though, so the punishment for my suboptimal strategy could have been a lot worse."
ftlgame,3c9txq,ManWithHangover,0,Mon Jul 6 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"Doesn't work.  Max damage you can do is 12 (4 rooms x 3 damage with Glaive) + 10 (5 rooms x 1 damage x 2 beams with the Pike) = 22 damage, and Phase 2 has 23 hull.  You would need either replace a Pike with a Hull or replace your Glaive and a Pike with 2 Halbards.  Edit: Or use the Beam drone :)"
ftlgame,3c9txq,resont,3,Mon Jul 6 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, he's right. The flagship only has 22 hull (count it in my first screenshot), and you can actually hit up to six rooms with a Pike by going from the shield room to the drone room. You can hit all four of the empty rectangular rooms in between. I hit those six rooms with each Pike and three with the Glaive, dealing 21 damage at once."

ftlgame,3c9txq,apemanzilla,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:54:27 2015 UTC,"It was, though it took a while for it to come together. There's a lot of beam combinations that are equally powerful (or close to it), too. This, two glaives, two halberds plus a pike, or even four pike beams are all capable of destroying the flagship in one hit. The only significant disadvantage is that you're totally screwed if you run out of drones to hack shields."

ftlgame,3c9sur,Mcginnis,6,Mon Jul 6 05:33:37 2015 UTC,"It happens. Consider it a lesson learned.  The worst way I ever lost a boarder was while using Crystal B. I boarded a ship in an asteroid field, took out their shields (a remarkably stupid thing to do, in hindsight) and then killed the crew. The shields were still down afterwards, and the ship's layout made it impossible to send back all of my boarders at once because there were no four-man rooms. This was a problem because system cooldown rules apply at hazardous beacons whether or not you're fighting a ship; I had to teleport two boarders back, wait, and then teleport the other two back. While I was waiting, a stray asteroid hit the room my other two boarders were in, killing one. The real kicker was that the boarder that died was a Crystalman. I teleported the last one back before asteroids could destroy the ship, but I was so mad.  Long story short, you want to be careful when teleporting boarders, because you have to wait several seconds before you can bring them back to what will hopefully be safety. Upgrading teleporting mitigates this a bit because it means a shorter cooldown. Also, a clone bay will bring back your boarders even if they're on an exploding ship (but not a ship that jumps away)."
ftlgame,3c9sur,BepisChristmas,8,Mon Jul 6 06:12:41 2015 UTC,"the ship's layout made it impossible to send back all of my boarders at once because there were no four-man rooms     It's not impossible. You can actually teleport more than 2 people back from a 2-tile room with this trick: Get 2 people stand in there, and make the others run through the room. The moment all of them are inside the room, pause and hit recall. Everyone inside the room will be teleported back."
ftlgame,3c9sur,ChummyCommie,2,Mon Jul 6 08:11:03 2015 UTC,Can I teleport more than 2 people to a ship by doing something similar?
ftlgame,3c9sur,samtheredditman,2,Mon Jul 6 22:21:14 2015 UTC,"Highly unlikely, almost no ships have 2 tile teleporters you can walk through. This is why the teleporter is almost always a terminal.  Edit: I am wrong here, just the ships I wanted to use for it. Adjudicator (Zoltan A), Gila Monster (Mantis A), Bulwark (Rock A), DA-SR 12 (stealth B) and Bravais (Crystal A) are the only ones with terminal teleporters, which will make teleporting more than the room allows impossible. The Shrike's (Lanius B) and Shivan's (Rock B) doors are awfully close together so I doubt you could get more than 3 per teleport."
ftlgame,3c9sur,TimLearyzMajik,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:47:17 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've never thought about that, but I know a crewmember doesn't have to be stationary to be teleported so it makes sense.

ftlgame,3c9sur,BepisChristmas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:20:33 2015 UTC,"This also works with Medbay's. If you use Mantis B for example and have a 4 man crew and after a fight you need to heal all 4, you can place 3 in the Medbay and have one bounce around inside it. It will heal all 4 at the same time. Fun little trick."

I've also sent boarders over to ships that are trying to jump away and didn't keep their piloting neutralized. Then once I also accidentally fired my weapons and blew up the ship that I had boarders on. I've kicked myself every time that I have lost boarders to stupid mistakes."
ftlgame,3c9sur,plafiff,5,Mon Jul 6 14:26:37 2015 UTC,"Pause more. Successful boarding requires great care.  Engi B is the last ship I'd imagine anyone buying a teleporter on, but if you get a strong crew, why not. It kind of makes sense even if your crew is lacking, since it gives a lot of blue options that give crew. (But not really. If you desperately need crew, just buying a crewmember might be better in that case.)"

The worse the fire is the better, since the AI will always put shields at the highest priority, they will run in to try and put out the fire, but with the doors hacked, they will (usually) not get out in time before they burn to death.  but to each their own :D"

ftlgame,3c7rty,liltonyabc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:53:32 2015 UTC,Isnt it better to leave 1 crew left for the last 2 phases and then repeatedly mind control their remaining crew to reduce evade to 0% while avoiding the AI auto repair.
ftlgame,3c7rty,n_slash_a,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:21:00 2015 UTC,You leave the guy in the laser room alive the whole time.
ftlgame,3c7rty,liltonyabc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:39:21 2015 UTC,Does that work even if you don't have cloaking?
ftlgame,3c7rty,n_slash_a,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"Oh yes!  Depending on your evasion/shields/defense drones, you might take some hits (even if you have cloaking you might take some hits), but once you take out the ion, missiles, and beam weapons you can't be hurt (as long as you have 3 shields).  In fact, this is a good time to make sure all your guys are fully trained.  In phases 2 & 3, the systems will repair, but the crew will stay dead.  For phase 2: Send two boarders to to the weapons, and the other two to drones.  It usually takes about the same amount of time to completely destroy the drone system as it does the two weapons.  From there run everyone to shields and easy win.  For phase 3: Same tactic, but just missiles and mind control, then take out shields."
ftlgame,3c7rty,itsamamaluigi,3,Mon Jul 6 23:29:03 2015 UTC,"Even better on Mantis B/C and Crystal B, you can teleport all four guys to the missile room and two will go to the main body of the flagship because the missile room only holds 2. Same thing, just works a little quicker."

ftlgame,3c7p8m,Spacetime_Inspector,2,Sun Jul 5 18:05:59 2015 UTC,Yes definitely
ftlgame,3c7p8m,The_Optimus_Rhyme,2,Sun Jul 5 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"If you use the Defense II drone to shoot down most of the Flagship's boarding drones, then power the Anti-Drone whenever there isn't a boarding drone in flight, eventually the Flagship will run out of drone parts and won't be able to field its normal combat drone and beam drone, which will make its normal weapons loadout and its Power Surge much less threatening.  Ideally you should have enough damaging weapons that wearing down the Flagship's hull once its shields are down (from your boarders punching them) shouldn't take long, but if it does take a while then the Anti-Drone will prove its worth."
ftlgame,3c7p8m,Leylite,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"Anti-Drone Drone is extremely weak.  It will keep down about 3/4th of one drone on average - not even one drone.  This is because a) it's only around 80% accurate when taking down enemy drones, and b) it fires so slowly it won't fully keep even one drone down to begin with.  So, it's... better than not having it, I guess, but it will be very underwhelming and won't really do a lot."
ftlgame,3c7p8m,Twinge,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:29:15 2015 UTC,"Without cloaking, the Anti-Drone helps a lot against the FS's drone surge. If you have a strong boarding team and good support weapons, you can ditch the Boarding Drone. It almost never land where you want it to. Worst case, it will land in one of the FS's artillery room and get stuck there."
ftlgame,3c7p8m,ChummyCommie,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"Ditch the boarding drone (they're pretty unreliable) and keep the defense and anti-drone.

Then BAM, here comes this lone federation ship and it just unleashes a constant barage of plasma death, it's unrelenting, your shields can't stand up, your hull is getting ripped apart, your systems are going off line one by one, and the shots just keep coming, never stopping.  Why, that pirate slug crew is spurting bio matter out of their slimy pseudopods so fast the clone by starts replicating you before you're even dead.  Of course you're going to surrender.

Anyway, the advanced Burst Laser was a BL-3 which cost 2 power. You could only get them by taking on a boss in each new sector and it was random for what you got, but when I got 4 of them and a Weapon Pre-Igniter I was unstoppable. 20 shots as soon as you warp in?

ftlgame,3c7a9f,Spacetime_Inspector,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:14:58 2015 UTC,You'd need enough firepower to take out the flagship right? Since you can't board it to death because the of the AI.
ftlgame,3c7a9f,plafiff,2,Sun Jul 5 17:22:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just like any boarding loadout. It doesn't take much though. The starting heavy pierce could take care of the first two stages, and then you just need some way of efficiently taking down the zoltan shield."
ftlgame,3c7a9f,Spacetime_Inspector,2,Sun Jul 5 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you would think it was a bad idea. I think the point of rock b is to turn into a fire boarding ship. With fire bomb, heavy Pierce (which has a pretty good chance of setting fires) and 4 rockmen, the only thing you need is the teleporter.  Shivan does have a hard time dealing with boarders. Rocks are slow so it's hard to rush in for defense. Not only does the ship lack doors but lacks venting options too. It's important to get some extra crew for defending. Even mind control is really useful."

All that said, the entire game up to this point is a preparation for this battle - a means of upgrading your ship's offenses and defenses so you can stand up to this boss, and a way to learn how to fight a long and relatively protracted fight, so as to get momentum on your side rather than the enemy's side.  The boss's two real weaknesses are that its weapons are relatively slow-charging, and it's crewed only by humans (although there are a lot of them)."

ftlgame,3c6g7j,itsamamaluigi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:19:00 2015 UTC,"I always recommend getting Cloaking since it allows you to avoid the terrible 3-rocket barrages in Phase 1, Drone Surges in Phase 2 and Power Surges in Phase 3. The cool-down for Cloaking at level 1 syncs with the Drone Surge and rocket barrages.  If you don't manage to pick up Cloaking, try your best to pick up a Drone System and run at-least 1 Defense Drone to take out those nasty rockets. Also, I advise you to try to max out Shields and Engines.  In the Flag Ship fight, if you don't have the means of surely dodging it's main damage output (rockets/Drone Surges/Power Surges), then you are going to have to kill it faster than it can kill you."
ftlgame,3c6g7j,ExplosiveLee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:42:19 2015 UTC,"Think of the boss not as an actual boss but as a puzzle. It has certain attacks you must counter and weaknesses that you must exploit. The first few times you play, you won't be prepared and you won't know how to beat the flagship. But if you read some guides, you'll learn a lot about how to handle it.  Things can spiral out of control quickly against the boss, with damage leading to more damage. So it seems more overpowered than it really is. Once you learn how to defend against its attacks it becomes much easier, even trivial if you have the right setup.  It can be frustrating having to ""start over"" but in many cases, just going back to the beginning of the boss fight won't even help. You have to start over in order to build your ship better. It's like if you're underleveled in an RPG, except instead of leaving to grind you start the game over and try again (the amount of time spent is roughly the same, maybe even less in FTL)."

You could put other utility weapons like a Small Bomb, 2-shot laser, or even something like a Repair Blast in the rest of the weapons loadout and be perfectly fine.  It's also so expensive to get to that point (you have to spend scrap to fully upgrade your weapons system, let alone having to actually shell out money for non-free Vulcans) that you might die in the middle of that upgrade route if your defenses aren't up to par."
ftlgame,3c4seb,Leylite,4,Sat Jul 4 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"A single fully spun-up Vulcan by itself can theoretically take down any ship, unless it gets knocked offline or your ship gets destroyed first, so I don't see any reason why two wouldn't simply make most battles go faster. I think the hardest part would be just finding two Vulcans and still being able to afford useful defensive investments like cloaking or a fourth shield."

I wouldn't recommend it in anything other than end game, when you already have strong shields and engines. It will get you killed before about sector 6 unless you get really lucky.

There are a few downsides to the bullet hose you'll have when you pull this off:   Maxing out your weapons subsystem is expensive as hell Vulcan guns have a medium-long spin up time. Meaning the first couple of shots will drizzle against the enemy shields impotently like a squirt gun against a tank. You're vulnerable when spinning up your guns. Since the enemy has enough time to load their big guns, you need to invest in a good defense. Having 2 Vulcans and next to no shields will get you blasted faster than a Zoltan peace convoy in Mantis-Territory. One lucky missle or laser spam to your weapons resets the timer and lets your stick your thumbs up your bum for another 10+ seconds while the gun spins up again   If you manage to protect your weapons, you'll be unstoppable.

It's really good with a Pre Igniter. Can also be very useful on ships with just 3 weapon slots."
ftlgame,3c4iz6,Eirh,3,Sat Jul 4 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"Flak I is far superior. THe spread is tighter, reload is rapid, it's an ideal shield breaker but not terrible for damage either.  Flak II is just too slow to reload, limiting your overall weapon cycle rate sine you're probably reliant on it for shield breaking duties. And the spread means it's practically worthless for Autoscouts and certain other ship layouts.  The only time Flak II is worhtwhile is on 3 weapon slot ships IMO, otherwise give me 2x Flak I's or even 1 Flak I and pretty much any other weapon."
ftlgame,3c4iz6,AyCarrumba,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:53:33 2015 UTC,"Flak 1 is probably better overall just because it's a useful weapon in most loadouts, but if you can support it then Flak 2 is much more powerful. It's way more power-efficient than Flak 1 (over twice the projectiles for only 1 extra power) and has great synergy with the Halberd and Glaive beams. A larger grouping does mean less accuracy for damaging rooms, but I tend to avoid using Flak to deal damage unless I have no other options or the enemy ship is in a non-threatening state. It's much more useful for thinning out shields for laser salvos or beams."
ftlgame,3c4iz6,BepisChristmas,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"Flak's a shield-breaker to me, not my favorite source of damage - especially where auto-scout or some other 'skinny' ship layouts are concerned.

ftlgame,3c3zo3,Play_To_Nguyen,4,Sat Jul 4 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"Bombs are the best boarding support weapons, but a missile can also work alright - most of them take 3 power and take a long time to charge up, but they can destroy medbays/clonebays, and with the added bonus of occasionally causing fires or breaches.  You will also want to get a laser or beam weapon at some point to help you take down Zoltan shields, destroy auto-ships, and damage the occasional ship that you want to manually destroy instead of board.  All that said, if you get enough crew to start using 4-man boarding parties you can actually put off getting a support weapon for quite some time, since you can often overwhelm the early game's low crew counts with distraction tactics, and sabotaging medbay/clonebays, oxygen or shields."
ftlgame,3c3zo3,Leylite,3,Sat Jul 4 17:15:17 2015 UTC,"There are three kinds of weapons that can be useful for boarding ships: to destroy ships mainly auto-scouts, to support boarding strategies and to remove super shields.  Bombs (like others have said) are great for supporting boarders. Some bombs are great for removing systems (Breach 2 bombs espeically for prevent AI from repairing a room, Fire bombs in 4 tile rooms).  Ion weapons are great for removing super shields and can be good for removing shield if you are facing a ship you can't board. They alsp don't do hull damage so can even support boards in other ways (eg. Your boarders have destroyed the shields but the enemy crew are healing in the medbay. You can use you ion weapons to disable the medbay so that your boarders can deal with the crew in there)  Fire weapons and Rockmen go hand in hand.  If you have hacking to support your boarders then beams plus hacking can destroy any ships you can't board. Also beams are great at removing super shields.  I hoped this helped :)"
ftlgame,3c3zo3,Dude579,6,Sat Jul 4 22:20:41 2015 UTC,"Bombs. Always bombs. Small, breach, stun, fire, it doesn't really matter. Almost all bombs make good boarding support.  In addition to bombs you'll want at least one weapon that can hurt the flagship's hull, so you don't have to sacrifice a crew member to kill each stage. This can be as simple as acquiring a Heavy Laser 1 or a combat drone. If you don't have Zoltan Shield Bypass, you'll need something beefy to take down the shield fast enough - ion weaponry works fine for this."
ftlgame,3c3zo3,Spacetime_Inspector,2,Sat Jul 4 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"Most weapons are fine, so don't worry too much about getting the right weapons on boarding runs. You basically want something that can do hull damage (even a Heavy Laser 1 is completely fine for that) so you can deal with Auto Drones and something that can take down Zoltan Shields in a resonable time. You also want to have ways to deal with enemies with med/clone bays, but you don't even need weapons for that (although bombs are great for that) since Hacking or Mind Control can also usually do the job."
ftlgame,3c49mo,trollnoob3214,5,Sat Jul 4 17:07:08 2015 UTC,"Ships without oxygen have been suggested and created many time, but, ultimately, it's just a very strong upgrade, to the point where a few less crew doesn't matter that much. The extra system slot alone is awesome, especially when you don't have to give up shields or medbay for it.  The ship sounds fairly hard in the beginning, but a cakewalk later on. And kind of basic - how long would a fight last with that one little thing. Maybe throw in an extra system or something - drones or a special artillery. Maybe add in an ion intruder and anti-personnel, but take away the medbay and a lanius. And increase the cooldown on the thing.  @edit  Oh, and I'm pretty sure you can't do the augment, either.

Level 2 shields is a high priority for me since it protects against enemies with a laser and beam and only costs 50 scrap plus power. Show us some screenshots of your ships after a bit of gameplay to see what you've been doing.  Also, don't buy power for when you upgrade the medbay and oxygen. It's better to take power from the engines and put it into the medbay or oxygen only when you need it."
ftlgame,3c1aw3,SmartAlec105,2,Fri Jul 3 22:18:26 2015 UTC,My word of advice is to try to stick with the stock weapons you are given for early Sectors (Sectors 1-4) because generally (for most ships) you want to focus on upgrading your shields and engines for the first 3 sectors. Most ships' stock weapon layout are good enough to deal with enemies that have 1-2 shields.  I generally stay away from High-power weapons since they have a longer charge time compared to most of the 1 or 2 power weapons. The only time I go for High-power weapons is when I have a Weapon Pre-ignitor or have maxed out Cloaking.
ftlgame,3c1aw3,ExplosiveLee,3,Fri Jul 3 23:20:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I try to stick with the bare minimum for weapons unless I find a particularly strong weapon, so able to take out 2 shields plus one for enemies with 2 shields. And I'm a math guys so I always knew BL2 was slightly more efficient than BL3."
ftlgame,3c1aw3,ninjakitty7,2,Fri Jul 3 23:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, BL2 is awesome."
ftlgame,3c1aw3,ChummyCommie,2,Sat Jul 4 16:48:42 2015 UTC,"You should see the guides on the side bar. There are just too many things about FTL to list in a single post, and those guides pretty much covered them all."
ftlgame,3c1aw3,Random-Webtoon-Fan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:12:32 2015 UTC,"Shields are important too, and I would say 2 layers of Shield is far more important then engines, but 4 layers of shields would not help you against waves of missiles the boss will throw at you."
ftlgame,3c1aw3,TimLearyzMajik,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:40:33 2015 UTC,"I would say your doing things inefficiently. Level 2 shields is highly valuable, level 3 is really good. However, level 4 is way too much if you've neglected your engines.  I usually go for the 35% evade on my engines (so I can get up to 45 with crew) before I hit level 3 shields and even think about level4. Think of it this way, enough shields makes you immune to lasers and beams, but does nothing to missiles and can be completely negated by ion weapons. Engines help out on everything.  On the weapons line, those big weapons are good if you can support them. This means getting them charged and firing before you take damage and start getting whittled down. If (especially early) you can't hit them before they hit you, then you're better off with faster lighter weapons. This is why the flak 1 is so much preferred over the more powerful and efficient flak 2.   Definitely check the guides for more help and or search, but most importantly keep playing. You'll find what works for you eventually."
ftlgame,3c0a1p,trollnoob3214,12,Fri Jul 3 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"Are you hugely tanky? Because if you roll with Vulcan/Glaive, you'll be doing absolutely zero damage for the first thirty seconds or so of any fight. They don't synergize very well. With your pew-pew loadout you can get a six-shot volley in after 14 seconds, which, depending on how you target it, can buy you more time for the Vulcan to spin up. I don't think I'd try for the two big weapons without at least L7 engines, a defense drone, and preferably L4 shields."

ftlgame,3c0a1p,drewimus,8,Fri Jul 3 17:44:34 2015 UTC,"In general, it's not the best idea to have two high level weapons. That being said, you can make it work. L3 hacking in conjunction with the Glaive Beam can get a powerful shot in before the Vulcan spins up. Of course, as previously mentioned, you have to be able to survive until the beam charges. Consider highly upgrading your shields and engines, and/or use cloaking or a defense drone to help."
ftlgame,3c0a1p,TopEchelonEDM,2,Sat Jul 4 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"This is the smartest approach, but I agree it's still very dependent on tanking potential. Now throw in a pre-igniter, and we have ourselves a dream loadout..."

It usually saves the screenshots in some dumb file directory you couldn't possibly remember, so go to your steam library and right click FTL and then something like show screenshots. In the window that opens then choose the ""Show on Disk"" option. It should open the folder where the screens are saved and you can copy the file directory from there.  Then choose a site where you upload the screenshots (like Imgur. You don't even need an account or anything on that site) and upload it. For imgur you have to press ""Upload images"", ""browse your computer"" and then go to the right folder, which you can do by copy and pasting the file directory I mentioned before into the top line. Choose the pic you want to upload and click ok.  It might sound a bit more complicated than it actually is. If you know where the screenshots are saved it's really easy."

It's good to have all of these at level 2 because if they get hit, they hopefully won't become fully disabled and still be functional.   Alternatively you could upgrade one more level of shields to have a buffer for shields so you'll still hopefully have 3 layers of shields if your shields system gets hit and spend the remainder on Piloting system (total cost of 100 scrap).

ftlgame,3bx77u,BepisChristmas,6,Thu Jul 2 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"One of the developers or people who've run more thorough experiments, feel free to correct me...  I believe the way nebula marking works is that first the graph of the sector is made, then certain clusters of beacons are marked as ""nebula beacons"", and then finally the background graphic of the sector is procedurally generated, with nebula graphics layered around in certain areas until the game thinks the nebula beacons are ""sufficiently covered"" by the nebula graphics. Obviously this is an edge case where the graphics ""just barely reach"" but there's no purple stuff."
ftlgame,3bx77u,Leylite,4,Thu Jul 2 23:57:06 2015 UTC,"This is close to my understanding.  Another curious aspect is that nebula beacons can overwrite other beacons - I believe this is because when the nebula graphics are put in, any normal beacons caught in the same area are just converted into nebula beacons."

Here with your run, I'll have to ask why you were fighting in a fight with an ASB? I'm not sure if there is any event early on that has one that fires at you, unless you let the rebels catch up. So it looks to me the point where you really messed up, what letting the rebels catch up to you."

I've also heard the Mantis War Camp can have an ASB now if you try to shoot a conventional missile and fail, but I haven't run into that myself yet.  EDIT: Today I did shoot a missile at the Mantis War Camp and there was no ASB, so never mind that."

I suppose you can subtract 10 for selling the basic laser and 22 for selling the small bomb.  Still, take 1933 scrap and add the 1478 scrap he has in cargo... that's 3411 scrap. Again, that's under the assumption that he also received all his crew for free as well as a free combat drone, two free Flak IIs, and a free Burst Laser II (otherwise those things add another 300 scrap).  3411 scrap seems impossible, even on easy, with triple scrap recovery arms, going past the exit every sector, and incredible luck.

ftlgame,3buj5j,resont,5,Thu Jul 2 12:11:07 2015 UTC,I'm still trying. Fucking Nisos. I tried with this ship so many times and it always sucks. That's the only ship I have never beaten normal with.
ftlgame,3buj5j,LucasTyph,4,Thu Jul 2 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"To me, the Nisos is not a bad ship, just a tiny bit worse than the Osprey. IIRC, the only differences are the Dual Laser (instead of the BL II) and the Artillery beam.  The strategy I use with it is creating a ""tank"" with the beam as main offense, getting some good defenses early on and upgrading the artillery to L3. Bombs and missiles also help a lot in that. Further on, if the RNG gods smile to me and give me decent weaponry, the ship becomes a normal gunship."
ftlgame,3buj5j,resont,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:59:56 2015 UTC,Oh this is interesting. Never thought about this strategy. Thanks :) What system should I buy? Cloak + Drone Control with Def Drone 1?  Edit: Should I de-power artillery when I have decent weapons?
ftlgame,3buj5j,itsamamaluigi,3,Thu Jul 2 16:42:32 2015 UTC,"That's probably how I'd go. Teleporter is not really useful. Mind Control is okay but not great either. Hacking is a great system but I think its best uses are to drop shields (unnecessary with the artillery beam) or to hack the enemy medbay for boarding purposes.  Cloaking + defense drone will let you avoid most damage, giving the beam time to charge up. Once you get rolling you'll be unstoppable. It's all about reaching the late midgame with FTL.  For a long time I couldn't do anything with the Swallow (Kestrel C). It's not a horrible ship, not amazing either, but I kept losing over and over with it. Just had to get over the hump.  As for depowering artillery, it's entirely dependent on your weapons. I usually leave it up if necessary because I rarely run out of power, but you'll have to decide for yourself if your weapons are good enough that you no longer need the artillery."

ftlgame,3buj5j,BepisChristmas,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"Hacking is a great system but I think its best uses are to drop shields (unnecessary with the artillery beam) or to hack the enemy medbay for boarding purposes.   I've found that at the right levels hacking and cloaking together can fully protect you from big, slow-charging weapons like Flak 2 and large missiles. Basically you just alternate cloaking after said weapon fires (or right before if it's a Glaive and you need to let your shields regenerate), and then hack right when the cooldown is almost done. If you time one right, the other should be ready to use the next time you need it.  I don't have this down to an exact science, so maybe someone who has tried this tactic more thoroughly can confirm or challenge this, but I think having both systems at level 2 should allow you to stall and dodge slower weapons indefinitely. Having one or both at level 3 is even better, of course.  Also, one quick side note for /u/resont: I don't know if you know this based on your original post, but you can just beat the Flagship on easy with the other ships and still unlock Crystal A. That's how I did it."

Yes, they're weak and not particularly special for actions...but in later stages of the game they are invaluable for giving your ship more energy bars than is possible with the max. When you get to the final battles and boss this seems to be much more important than other factor. It's really a priceless benefit to have full shields, full engine, all your weapons powered, a drone or two, and still have leftover for all the other systems and cloaking. Without them you would have to sacrifice something."
ftlgame,3bsf85,funfsinn14,8,Thu Jul 2 00:09:15 2015 UTC,"You can also do a whole bunch of tricks with their mobile power in relation to ionized systems - immunizing your last shield(s) so they cannot go completely down to ion alone, restoring power to ionized systems (like weapons or cloaking from e.g. an ion intruder or pulsar), booting power out of ionized systems (like cloaking, hacking, or mind control) so you can use it in other systems, etc."

For example, it is possible that most of the people that picked mantis might have rockmen as their second preference (perhaps since both are good at boarding). That means that if mantis were not in the game, rockmen might be first with 27%!    There are of course many possible permutations of this but the jist is that it is pretty likely that the winner of this poll won't actually be what players like the most.

ftlgame,3buj63,appleswithsauce,11,Thu Jul 2 07:02:27 2015 UTC,"I would keep the room with two rows of X's unbreached. When enemies teleport into the weapons room, and I have nothing but Zoltan in those three system rooms, I send all of that crew to the room to the right, so they can breathe while I vent the systems.  Side note: Zoltan in piloting is a waste of potential power"
ftlgame,3buj63,Flarkinater,5,Thu Jul 2 13:30:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a fan of this. Too attached to my open doors switch, I suppose.  And there are some upsides to having lots of oxygen; it takes a while more for another breached room to drain when you have more of them connected. I think it takes about 10 or 11 rooms together for O2 lvl 2 to keep it livable, but, generally, the more of them, the longer you have."
ftlgame,3buj63,mekloz,5,Thu Jul 2 09:51:34 2015 UTC,"I think like just about everything else in FTL, it should be situational.  If you have a crew full of mantis, you'll want to repair breaches.  Boarders can be dealt with easily, and breaches in important rooms would pose less of a threat if you could open all doors to slow the O2 loss.  But if you only have a couple engis and maybe a Zoltan or two, it would absolutely be worth leaving a breach or two open.  You'd be able to suffocate boarders easier without direct combat, and new breaches in dangerous places would be less of a threat."
ftlgame,3buj63,chewbacca77,2,Thu Jul 2 12:17:28 2015 UTC,"Sure. I was mostly just saying that it's way too much trouble opening/closing all those individual doors manually for the not-so-clear benefit it provides.  It's rarely ever a problem to deal with ""normal"" boarders. If they get in your door room or are lanius, it can be trouble, but then this doesn't really help you anyway, and can be a problem if you have to run. Other than that, those few extra seconds are unlikely to make a difference."
ftlgame,3buj63,mekloz,2,Thu Jul 2 12:40:42 2015 UTC,I always thought that a breach should permanently lower your maximum health by 1 per breach giving you an incentive to fix it.

ftlgame,3buj63,SmartAlec105,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:27:03 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if it's worth fixing a room that's been breached but no damaged. Take back up battery for example. You can't man it.
ftlgame,3buj63,superfantastic1,4,Thu Jul 2 07:25:24 2015 UTC,Too risky for little benefits I think. If your backup battery is destroyed when you need it (in a Ion Storm for example) you will take a lot of time to repair it and your crew will take damage.
ftlgame,3buj63,Kuirem,2,Thu Jul 2 07:39:06 2015 UTC,"If you need that room to walk to other places, I'd count that as part of the crew path. (I'm about to go off topic. Stop reading if you want.) Breaches are also nice if you have two useless rooms next to each other, but you have to keep a door open to have the second room vented out. Now that room two is breached, we can close the doors leading to room one while keeping room two vented out. (Hopefully you can imagine that.) This means intruders will spend more time fiddling with doors and suffocating."
ftlgame,3buj63,LucasTyph,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:40:52 2015 UTC,"I actually used that strategy when I was almost losing in Sector 8 and got a breach in my O2 room. I decided to just stick with it and, in the final battle, I closed the flagship's boarders in that room, so they didn't destroy it and ended up dying through suffocation, which helped me win that game.  It could be used, but it's only really useful for very specific situations."

I think it's hardly worth the time to grind numbers on firing rates and such when there's three massive points in Ion Charger's favor:   1) It still works well if the enemy can cloak  2) It only costs two power, not three.   3) It can get around a Defense Drone 2.   I was running a pair of Ion Chargers on my last run with the Cerenkov, and had power for a Halberd beam. (I also had a Fire beam, so had the freedom to set weapons to either kill or cook). Not possible with IB2."
ftlgame,3bp2va,51Gunner,5,Thu Jul 2 18:05:40 2015 UTC,"For anyone still unclear how ion weaponry works exactly, this video should help.  As mekloz mentioned, your math should really be assuming a fully leveled Weapons crewmember dropping cooldowns by 20% - both these weapons will get you to max level very quickly if you're not already there.  I'd definitely consider Ion 2 to have more raw strength, but when you take into account the power requirements I fully agree the Charge Ion is the superior weapon."

ftlgame,3bopzv,CSGOWasp,9,Tue Jun 30 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"Hacking works really well on the first boss fight (no zoltan shield, no defense drones) but less well on the other fights.  Other than that, flak works well (3 or 7 chances to take down shields), Burst laser works well, ion guns are slow but work well, bombs work well for stages one and two.  In general, I would say it sounds like you need to do a better job of firing all your weapons at roughly the same time. If you have flak weapons fire them first, then time your lasers to hit just after flak hits, and then be ready with beam weapons as soon as the final shield goes down."
ftlgame,3bopzv,Drunk_Packer_Fan,4,Tue Jun 30 22:39:39 2015 UTC,"In general, I would say it sounds like you need to do a better job of firing all your weapons at roughly the same time. If you have flak weapons fire them first, then time your lasers to hit just after flak hits, and then be ready with beam weapons as soon as the final shield goes down.   This is solid advice. As an addendum I'd like to mention that pausing is extremely helpful for timing volleys when you can't just fire all of your stuff at once. Flak has the longest delay from being fired to hitting the enemy ship, followed by lasers. Beams have almost no delay, so be careful not to fire them too early."
ftlgame,3bopzv,BepisChristmas,9,Tue Jun 30 23:33:31 2015 UTC,What I like to do is mind control the enemy pilot just before you fire your volley... Making all your shots hit.
ftlgame,3bopzv,superhareball,5,Wed Jul 1 00:08:41 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent tactic, and not an obvious one to employ. Along the same lines, distracting the pilot in general is a good technique to lower enemy evade, and thus increase the chances that your volleys will land."
ftlgame,3bopzv,kayroice,3,Wed Jul 1 00:22:13 2015 UTC,is mind control expensive to add on? Sounds great when combined with hacking their shields or weapons
ftlgame,3bopzv,superhareball,6,Wed Jul 1 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's the same cost as hacking, around 80 or so... Might be dependant on ship. Another thing with mind control that people may not know, is that if one of your crew is mind controlled by the enemy ship, you can cancel this out by mind controlling him yourself, he just goes back to normal. You only need one power level of MC to do this."
ftlgame,3bopzv,ChummyCommie,7,Wed Jul 1 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"MC is 75, slightly cheaper than Hacking. Cost of everything is the same for every ship."
ftlgame,3bopzv,Leylite,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:40:20 2015 UTC,"Suffice to say that's not how it works... Flagship Phase 3 is guaranteed to spawn with level 3 mind control (with AE enabled), and level 1 mind control is always sufficient to completely counteract it."
ftlgame,3bopzv,Dude579,5,Wed Jul 1 19:01:05 2015 UTC,"There are lots of weapons that can work.   Missiles ignore shields taking that issue out of the equation but can be shot down by defence drones and use resources. Obviously, aim at the shields so that you can use your other weapons remove shields completely. and keep them down without burning through your supplies. Bombs can work too and are the same as missiles but can't be shot down and don't do hull damage.  Ion weapons can be great at removing shields but you need to have enough powerful shots per time to be able to miss a few but still keep the ion chain going.   Also you can just have lots of shots get through shields. That is why weapons like flak 1 & 2 and burst laser 2 are so valuable. You just need to time things properly.  A cool way of removing shields temperorily is to hack them down. This stategy works very well with beams since they can't miss.  On the other side to remove evasion for a few moments you can mind control the enemy pilot or hack the piloting or engines.  Using a combo of these methods you can get through shields with enough weapons and systems."
ftlgame,3bopzv,BepisChristmas,3,Fri Jul 3 11:58:30 2015 UTC,"Bombs and hacking are great for sabotaging shields if your main damage-dealing weapons can't get through said shields in the first place. The Ion Blast 2 is also awesome because it can stack ion damage on shields faster than the damage wears off. Two IB1s will accomplish the same thing and require 1 less power, but one extra weapon slot.  If you should have enough shots to get through shields but the enemy has crazy evasion, bomb or hack piloting instead and then concentrate your fire on shields once their evasion is down.  Boarding is an option too. Maybe even the easiest option if the enemy doesn't have blast doors or a med/clone bay and you have good fighters. Some ships are much better than others for boarding, though, and relying on it to take out the flagship is much tougher than with pretty much all other ships."
ftlgame,3bopzv,51Gunner,2,Tue Jun 30 23:10:53 2015 UTC,I think from reading all of the great replies that I am lacking bombs / missiles in my setup. Its too good of a way to get the shields down
ftlgame,3bopzv,BobRedshirt,3,Tue Jun 30 23:48:39 2015 UTC,"Method 1: More Dakka. Shoot enough stuff that even if the odds of hitting are 50% or so, you'll probably still hit 5 times   Method 2: Reduce either enemy shield or evasion through hacking or mind control of pilot.  Method 3: Board them, bypassing shield and dodge entirely to engage in fisticuffs."

The harder part is more optional: if you want to make it look special then you probably need to know how to use some graphic programs or something (really not my thing so I don't exactly know).

ftlgame,3bomgs,Dude579,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:16:09 2015 UTC,"I believe the Burst Scatter I only fires 2 shots, which would mean you can't damage the enemy ship. Is that right?  On top of that, he doesn't have shields and the other ship has two beam weapons and a 2-shot heavy laser. Pretty rough.  Then again, it's hard to believe you could get this far in the game with such poor weapons, no shields, and overall just a very under-leveled ship. Without shields shouldn't you have been getting way more scrap? Without a missile weapon, what happened to all your missiles? Normally they accumulate pretty quickly if you're not using them."

ftlgame,3bomgs,Dude579,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:27:37 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah okay. Basically, I had a very poor weapons combo (which throughout sectors 1-7 was not able to improve) which only did 2 shield damage with the scatter and then a beam after. It had served me well so far.  And then, when i went against ships with three bubbles of shields I had good engines and cloaking so was easily able to jump away.  In this situation I was on the final beacon to sector 8, which would've got me an achievement for no environmental hazards (as well as putting me in a position for another achievement by dodging flagship weapons) securing Stealth B.  Basically, it all went wrong, because without thinking i clicked a blue option to do with scanners, and came across this ship with 3 shield bubbles... just as i ran out of fuel. meaning that one jump away from unlocking 2 achievements and a new ship i was stuck in a fight i literally couldn't win.

ftlgame,3bjmsc,asadasa,2,Tue Jun 30 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"Did you only use the boarding drones to board? You should always try to be conservative with supplies.  The best startegy against a ship like this is to board with both mantis. Even at 0% evade, that ship can't hurt you. Even if it had a missile launcher that is what the defense drone is for.   When you send your mantis aboard, the mantis fighting with enemy mantis should swap their position halfway through the fight so they don't die (there are guide about how to do this). You can even send 1 boarding drone in at the side to make sure things go your way.   In your current situation the best thing to do is jump away. Your crew won't survive in their ship and you have ran out of drone parts.  edit: I thought you were out of drone parts, but it was missiles you were out of. And it didn't matter where the boarding drone hits since the whole ship is out of oxygen so if they try to leave the medbay they will die"
ftlgame,3bjmsc,aguiarvicent3,2,Mon Jun 29 22:18:46 2015 UTC,"Just board and kill them. As soon as you do, your teleporter should reset and let you beam them back."

ftlgame,3bkiii,lpscharen,3,Mon Jun 29 23:36:59 2015 UTC,"First, sell rock plating and buy long-range scanners.  Sell the chain laser and upgrade weapons by 1 to run with Halberd and Charge Laser (and eventually with Ion Charger, too).  Upgrade hacking to level 3 to deal with level 4 shields.  Buy Battery Backup.  After that, you have lots of choice.  I'd consider getting the Defense I for better anti-missile protection than the Defense II.  Hull repair is good, but not necessary given your loadout.  I'd hold out to try to buy cloaking at another store."
ftlgame,3bkiii,MrNoS,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:38:31 2015 UTC,"First, I would sell rock plating and buy defence scrambler, then you can always hack (after taking down super shields)/ use offensive drones against any ship. I would then buy the ion blast and sell both laser weapons. I would run it with the ion charger and the halberd, ions to remove shields and halberd to do damage. I also would be looking for other beam weapons for two power (hull or pike beam) and even replace the combat drone for a beam drone.  If you decide you want to be more defensive then replace the combat drone for the defence drone mk 1. If not, I would sell the defence drone mk 2 for the mk 1.  Finally, both the back up battery and the hull repair drone can be useful. I would also consider swapping the SRA for LRS (but I don't know which way I would go with this). You could also forgo defence scrambler and get LRS instead and use the exploit to make sure your hacking drone manages to land on it's target."

ftlgame,3bkiii,comfortablytrev,2,Wed Jul 1 06:46:42 2015 UTC,"I would say so since the DD2 aims at all kinds of shots it can be too busy shotting a laser shot (that your shields can handle) to hit a big missile that will do major damage to you. Whereas the DD1 only targets missiles, flak shots, crystal shots and asteroids so it has a better chance to target the missiles.   edit: Also they cost less power."
ftlgame,3bkiii,Dude579,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:07:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's so obvious.  Excellent explanation, thanks"
ftlgame,3bkiii,comfortablytrev,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:09:35 2015 UTC,"I'd buy all the ions, upgrade weapons to run two chargers right away, keep the drone. This setup will easily kill the shield, some other system if you need it, and the flagship zoltan shield in no time. Leave the halberd for the majority of damage. Do not sell it.  Sell the rock plating and the other weapons, buy the LRS for a sector (sell them at the end of the next one). I'd put the rest of the scrap into getting system upgrades, like you said. Keep an eye out for cloaking, and remember you need oxygen.  I would also highly recommend level 3 doors if you have scarp left, because, even with zoltan shield, this crew might not survive too long if the flagship manages to board you.  You could buy hull repair. Might not be able to get cloak, it's a good safety net. But you should be fine."
ftlgame,3bkiii,mekloz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:20:57 2015 UTC,"My advice, is sell the charge laser(the other weapons give us more then is needed and it uses up power and time), pick up the second charge ion, and whatever you do, DO NOT. SELL THE HALBERD. The halberd beam is one of the best weapons for damage dealing in the game. With dual ions you can get the shields down easily, and with the halberd you'rd 100% guranteed 8 damage if you can hit 4 rooms. No worrying about your lasers missing, just 8 straight damage right away. It has a good charge time to for such a strong weapon."
ftlgame,3bkiii,Jimli_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:24:58 2015 UTC,"sell the combat 1 and get the defense II. upgrade your drones. maybe even carry the backup battery as well, and upgrade your reactor. double defense II's can make your ship nearly impervious to any attack."
ftlgame,3bkiii,Luigigames,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:45:46 2015 UTC,"I'm at the store in sector 6 and wanted some input from you guys on what to get. I was planning to sell the rock plating, combat drone, and charge laser, then buying the ion charger and upgrading weapons, engines, and reactor with plans to upgrade O2 soon. This will allow me to take down shields and then I can power down one charger to power up the chain laser. The other idea would be to sell the chain laser and then run the charge laser and the charge ion. Also thinking that the backup battery might be nice. Thoughts?"
ftlgame,3bkiii,l-Ashery-l,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:39:57 2015 UTC,"Eh, I've never really used the backup battery all that much, so I'm not sure it's worth it even with your surplus of scrap.  My thoughts:  Sell the Halberd and buy the Charge Ion. This gives you one ion damage every three seconds along with an opening volley of six ion damage. It won't get their shields down instantly, but once you're able to upgrade to a rank seven weapon subsystem, you'll be hard pressed to find an enemy that's not badly crippled after your opening volley with the CIs followed by the ChargeL.  Even with only four crew, I'd recommend picking up the teleporter as that's one of the most effective ways to neutralize the threat posed by the Flagship. Even if you're playing on hard and can only cripple two of the weapons, that's still two weapons that are being taken offline while your ship focuses on suppressing shields, cloaking, and the missile launcher. The only exemptions here are if your crew is entirely Engies (ie can't safely win a 2v1) or Zoltans (ie you need their power on your ship).  Two other options:   The hacking stun, while fairly lackluster overall, makes for an effective way to kill off the Flagship's crew. If you had a fire weapon, you could just hack the shield room and kill them there, but absent that, you could easily hack the medbay and slowly whittle their forces down that way. You could even bait them into the medbay by teleporting your boarding crew there once the weapons are down. This would allow you to easily kill off the crew in the first stage.  The Hull Repair drone is also a pretty decent buy as it greatly reduces your chances of dying due to bad luck when it comes to repair beacons and shop availability.  Behind these comes the Defense Scrambler, as while it's damn nice to have, you don't actually need it for your build. And that holds regardless of how you feel about the hacking drone exploit.  As tempting as it is to sell your chain laser now, I'm not sure it'd be worth it to upgrade your weapons straight to rank seven at this very moment. Also, while the ChainL has excellent DPS and works very well with ion heavy setups, you need the four shots from the ChargeL to get meaningful damage through to the Flagship in one volley, which is necessary thanks to its cloaking. I'd agree on selling the combat drone."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Th3Stranger,33,Mon Jun 29 13:02:52 2015 UTC,Definitely not - and not even because it depends on opinion.  Every weapon is dependent on other weapons.  Weapon synergy is by far the most important factor.
ftlgame,3bi8dd,chewbacca77,11,Mon Jun 29 13:34:27 2015 UTC,"No, because it's hard to compare weapons from different classes."

ftlgame,3bi8dd,Kuirem,12,Mon Jun 29 15:07:18 2015 UTC,"Even for that it can vary. Let's take Beam as an example, in general Glaive Beam is probably the worst due to the high cooldown and high PWR cost. However, paired with Flak II, Cloaking and Weapon Pre-Igniter you can kill most enemies in one hit.  A rough, general ranking (without considering the availability of weapons) :   Beam : Mini Beam > Hallberd Beam > Hull Beam > Pike Beam > Glaive Beam Missiles : Artemis > Pegasus > Hermes > Breach > Swarm Laser : Laser Charger (S) (Stealth C version) > Dual Lasers > BL2 > Heavy Laser 1 > other depending on loadout Flak : Adv.Flak > Flak I > Flak II Ion : Ion Blast II > Ion Charger > Ion Blast > Chain Ion > Heavy Ion   Bombs and other weapons not listed are too specific to situations (Anti-Bio Beam, Ion Stunner..)"
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Bloody_Lemon,7,Mon Jun 29 15:24:21 2015 UTC,I am a firm believer in Ion Charger > Ion Blast II.  My missiles btw: Artemis > Pegasus > Breach (that's the 4-damage slow-charging) > Swarm/Leto > Hermes > Hull (that's the Rock A).
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Kuirem,4,Mon Jun 29 15:32:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I said, even for a type of weapon not everyone agreed.  Now I avoid Ion and I will play with one only if dropped by an event so you are probably right."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,chewbacca77,3,Mon Jun 29 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"Ion Charger is always better.  It has the same power efficiency, but its much more versatile."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,ItsDominare,3,Mon Jun 29 15:52:01 2015 UTC,"Ion Charger is always better.   No idea how you can make that claim. Since one point of ion damage lasts 5 seconds, Ion Blast II can take down 4 shield bubbles by itself, Ion Charger cannot since it has a charge time of 6 seconds rather than 4. So which is the efficient weapon?"
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Leylite,3,Mon Jun 29 19:57:42 2015 UTC,"Ion Charger can if you have a gold weapons crew and you don't ever miss.  The real valuable part of Ion Charger is that you can continue to charge it up while you cloak, continue to charge it up so you can unleash all three once the enemy comes out of a cloak, or use it to distract a Defense II drone (usually the bane of any ion ship)."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,IAMATruckerAMA,4,Mon Jun 29 20:05:35 2015 UTC,Your weapons charge while the enemy is cloaked?
ftlgame,3bi8dd,chewbacca77,3,Mon Jun 29 21:43:43 2015 UTC,He's saying that you keep your current charge during cloaks.
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Leylite,2,Tue Jun 30 00:49:25 2015 UTC,"Right, you build up extra ion particles, wait out the first cloak, then start fresh as soon as they come out of cloak. Can't do that with a heavy ion or ion blast II."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,everybody_else,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:58:14 2015 UTC,"Also, ion charger tends to work a little better against enemies with high evasion.  If you shoot one at a time, then you need to hit with the next shot or else their system becomes unionized.  When you fire the ion in a burst, you have fifteen seconds to get in another hit (ten seconds if you only hit with two.)  This gives you three shots before the ion damage wears off."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,never_safe_for_life,2,Tue Jun 30 22:47:57 2015 UTC,"I have a different opinion on the beams: Beam: Mini -> Pike -> Hull -> Halberd -> Glaive  Halberd is definitely better than Pike. While the Pike can hit more rooms, the 2 damage of the Halberd is much more effective at disrupting a system. Also there are a limited number of ship layouts where you can hit a max # rooms.  I put BL2 above Heavy Laser for sure. It's arguably the top laser."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,mekloz,2,Mon Jun 29 21:22:46 2015 UTC,"Think you might be confusing "">"" with ""->"" here."

ftlgame,3bi8dd,mekloz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:27:01 2015 UTC,"Mini beam is very efficient with only one power required and 12 second cooldown. Personally, I don't think it translates very well into the late game, especially since you can only get it on 3 slot ships."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,ChummyCommie,3,Mon Jun 29 22:58:20 2015 UTC,Mini is also the only damage dealing beam capable of starting fire.
ftlgame,3bi8dd,superfantastic1,3,Tue Jun 30 01:41:21 2015 UTC,"This. There are too many factors to make a accurate list. For example, the amount of weapon slots available changes the tier of weapons. Weapons that require more tend to be better with 3 weapon slot ships."

ftlgame,3bi8dd,Kuirem,5,Mon Jun 29 18:15:01 2015 UTC,"Some top tiers weapon are quite obvious : Adv.Flak, Dual Lasers, Burst Laser 2 and Flak I. With their low cooldown, good shield piercing and high damage to power ratio they can complete almost all loadouts.  Missile will often fall into low tiers. Other than that, as the others said, it depends on opinions, ships, other systems..."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Spacetime_Inspector,5,Mon Jun 29 13:55:23 2015 UTC,"Unlike ships, weapons don't work in isolation.

ftlgame,3bi8dd,slowriderxcorps,2,Mon Jun 29 19:41:37 2015 UTC,"Eh, not really. In my playthrough for getting wins on Hard with every ship, I've not gone out of my way to buy a Flak I at a store to replace a weapon that is currently doing the job of shield-breaker. The reason it's right there at the top is because it's so obscenely common. If it's rarity was dropped to the same level as the Burst Laser II, I would rank it below Dual Lasers."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Kuirem,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"You still have ranked all the flak in first, even Flak II is higher than BL2 which is much more versatile.  If you take into account rarity you can remove unique weapons like Adv.Flak or Dual Laser that you can only find on one ship.  The first step of FF (Famous Flakoholics) is to admit you have a problem."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,slowriderxcorps,2,Tue Jun 30 07:38:16 2015 UTC,"That's just how good they are. The Flak II is ranked that high because it is the single most power-efficient shield-breaker in the entire game outside of the Adv. Flak, even more efficient than the Dual Lasers which you can't even get in the first place. The only reason I didn't put it above the Flak I is because it /is/ kind of vulnerable to weapon hacks, but even so that can be worked around. As for the Burst II, it's just 'good' all around at both the shield-breaker and damage-dealer roles, but it's beaten on all accounts on the breaker role by any kind of Flak, and I would much prefer to use heavy lasers or beam weapons for the latter role.  And to put into perspective how not-often my use of Flak is, in my current Hard Mode progress, there are 20 wins (out of 22 attempts) in various ships. Of those, only 5 ships used Flak at some point, and only 3 of those had it in a starring role by the end of the game (successful Manpower run in ZoltanA, dual Flak Is in the RockB and dual Flak IIs in the StealthC, which that ship in particular was using dual Laser Charger Is all the way through to Sector 7 until the change of tack)."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,mekloz,4,Tue Jun 30 08:17:25 2015 UTC,I think this list pretty much just confirms what others have already said: it's simply impossible to sensibly rate them.
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Twinge,3,Mon Jun 29 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"Some interesting things here.  Here's the spots we disagree the most on:  Flak II: Very powerful shield buster, but also quite a high cooldown and not very good at actually dealing damage by itself.  I'd put this more in 'good' tier rather than 'best' tier.  Fire Weapons: They just work so slowly I've always rated them pretty poorly; I'd virtually never buy a Fire Bomb or Beam at a store.  It's possible I am underrating them a bit, though - there's some neat tactics you can employ alongside Mind Control and such.  Flak Artillery: I pretty much consider this garbage.  I'd put this around 'barely useful' in the bottom 1/3rd or so.  Missiles: I am shocked to see Artemis so low - Artemis is virtually the same as a Small Bomb, and I consider it the only good missile weapon.  I'd definitely put Pegasus/Swarm below Ion II (which I'd also put WAY above Chain Ion), Heavy Laser, Burst I, etc."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,slowriderxcorps,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:45:50 2015 UTC,"Fire Control, as I call it, is just so much fun to use and against most enemies in the game it is absolutely devastating. It's not infallible by any measure for sure, System Repair drones can screw you over, auto-ships and Lanius are naturally impervious, and Slugs cannot be MC'd (although makeshift control via Rock/Suicide boarding still wrecks them).  The not-burst missiles are all so way down the list purely because Phase 2 exists. If you're forced to rely on missiles for shield breaking by that point and you don't have Defense Scrambler, you're almost certainly going to lose the entire run at that point."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Twinge,2,Tue Jun 30 23:59:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, your build is ultimately leading to the Flagship, but the other ~45 fights you have before then matter too.  Any ship with an Artemis starts with it and will provide solid value for the first half of the game or more."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,mekloz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:05:53 2015 UTC,"Flak Artillery: I pretty much consider this garbage   That's interesting; I've had plenty of success with it. Most of my Fed C runs tends to turn into a multi-beam-of-death around sector 6.  It's true that early on it's not very good, but late game matters, too. I'd actually definitely put it over the lone wolf that is artillery beam - there's no synergy with anything and it just wastes power for a bit of unfocused damage."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Captain_Lord_Avalon,3,Wed Jul 1 00:56:48 2015 UTC,"People haven't talked about bombs, so I will. IMO, they're better than missiles, because they can't be shot down (but they don't do hull damage).  I really like the Ion Bomb and Breach Bomb Mk II. Small Bomb is decent. Others, bleah. Heal & Repair Bombs are situational: could be useful, but can you really afford to use up a weapon slot for them? Maybe you keep it in the hold, until you need to sell it. Oh, Lockdown is also kinda situational. I don't like it, so I often forget to use it.  Oh, the Slug A's Breach Bomb Mk I is semi-useful - breaches do prevent autoships from repairing. OTOH it only does 1 system damage, so even with a breach, enemies fix it pretty quickly in many cases.  Of course bombs also use ammo. So their usefulness might depend on how your stock is when you acquire/ thnk about purchasing one."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,BepisChristmas,5,Mon Jun 29 17:20:59 2015 UTC,"I think bombs are best for supporting boarders or other crew-killing tactics. They generally hurt/stun crew members without directly doing hull damage, which is very useful if you want to keep the ship intact. They also ignore everything except for Zoltan Shields and evasion, which makes them great for taking out medbays or oxygen. Finally, breach and fire bombs are great if you want to stall repairs. One combination I've found is especially powerful is fire bombs with mind control. If the MC'd crew member stays in the burning room someone else will run in and have to fight him instead of putting out the fire, allowing it to spread and probably destroy the system."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,IrishBandit,2,Mon Jun 29 18:59:56 2015 UTC,My favorite tactic is teleporting Lanius into rooms and then Stun Bombing it once the defenders start fighting them. The Lanius don't lose much health and everyone sits in the room suffocating for however long the stun lasts.
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Leylite,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"Why stop there? With good timing, you can launch the bomb, move the Lanius out of the room just as the bomb is coming in, which stuns the enemy crew - then move back in and you can beat on them for a long time."
ftlgame,3bi8dd,Eirh,3,Mon Jun 29 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"Well there are rare cases where one weapon is objectively better than another weapon. Adv.

Vulcan is kind of meh for me it just misses too much and is sorta overrated same with the burst laser 2. I'd say any flak cannon is great when paired with a halbred beam. Missile launchers I pretty much ignore same with bombs, but if you are looking for an alternate beam grab a fire beam. It is insanely good I used to doubt it but the way AI handles fires ensures your beam will wreak havoc and cause tons of damage."

ftlgame,3bi1go,BepisChristmas,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:57:55 2015 UTC,"The first time I won with Stealth B, I forwent buying shields the first time I was able to because the store I went to also had a pre-igniter. It was not nearly as risky a decision as I thought it would be. I became untouchable for the whole early game, and probably most of the game after that part. I don't remember what my setup was for the flagship but I definitely remember it being a pretty painless fight."
ftlgame,3bfptp,Acedin,7,Sun Jun 28 20:39:32 2015 UTC,"probably should start with an ion/firebeam combo. i would go for ion bomb, due to it requiring missiles, and good for a low energy option that works for a long time.    most obvious crew synergy would be rock, but slugs also have a history of different ""ways"" of fighting. a stun/burn combo is fitting thematically, so a slug ship is my choice. when it comes to systems, i would have: No sensors (slugs) Mindcontrol (lvl 1) Drones (Boarding/or Ion intruder)    Name: Slugma"
ftlgame,3bfptp,Motorsagmannen,2,Sun Jun 28 20:53:17 2015 UTC,"The crew sounds great, I think a 2-3 man crew of Rock/Slug would be fun and fair.  Also the Ion Bomb would fit the Rock's artillery theme. However it would make the ship extremly powerfull, as it can deal with Sector 3 enemies on hard by default. On the other hand this ship could not deal with Autoscouts...  This would lead to me no including MC/Drones."
ftlgame,3bfptp,Motorsagmannen,2,Sun Jun 28 21:03:27 2015 UTC,"i was thinking no rock crew actually, only a 3 man slug crew. Ion bomb might in hindsight be a bit too powerful. maybe change it for one of the weaker ion guns..."

It'd probably have to pass through shields like the other Artillery weapons. I just finished my first Fed C run and the flak artillery seemed really underwhelming, like a flak 2 that charges slower and takes an extra power to run, whose firing time isn't well controlled.   You'd probably also want to change the crew around a bit, remove the Teleporter in favor of something like Mind Control, and give it a Dual Laser.   Rename the ship to The Burninator :)"

ftlgame,3bfptp,Dude579,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:44:10 2015 UTC,My ideas so far:  Replace Fed C and create something with fire artillery.  A slow 2 shot laser + Fire Beam.  Hacking + cheaper Firebeam.  Avoiding many other systems to not give it too much free value.
ftlgame,3bfptp,mekloz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:59:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm, Ion Blast and Fire Beam are good together but you have no way to deal with Auto/Lanius ships. I suggest to add a basic laser to the starting load out.   Also, maybe consider removing the medbay and giving the ship reconstructive teleporter instead. This then forces you to play differently and think about what you are doing.  Will the teleporter be a four or two tiles big? If you decide on four then limit the ships weapon slots to three to compensate."
ftlgame,3bg199,Featherspring,7,Sun Jun 28 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"Rock C method is the easiest. You can skip the first step steps, all you need is the Rock Homeworlds and to rename your Crystal crewmember to Ruwen."
ftlgame,3bg199,Gildedjandle,2,Sun Jun 28 23:36:37 2015 UTC,"I think the way they programmed this game is absolutely charming, and I don't mean that facetiously. It feels like all the rules are right there in front of you and if this method is viable, then it's a hilarious example."
ftlgame,3bg199,deusofnull,3,Sun Jun 28 23:49:34 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple really. The Beacon to the Crystal Homeworld only spawns in the Rock Homeworld, which is a blue event that can only be triggered by Crystals. Any Crystal Crew member can activate it, but to make it less RNG punishing for people that unlock it with the Stasis Pod Crystal they decided to put a quest into the Rock Homeworld showing you where the beacon is, if you have that crystal crewmember in your crew. Since he is always named ruwen, and it's really not the way a normal quest works, they hard coded into the game to just out that quest marker on the map if you have a Crystal named Ruwen on your ship.  Mind you that was all before AE came out, where there was no Rock C that started with a named crystal, and you couldn't change names of your crew during the run. The only way to get crystals was the Stasis Pod Quest or starting out with them on Crystal A or B."
ftlgame,3bg199,Eirh,2,Mon Jun 29 11:06:48 2015 UTC,Do you even need to rename the crew member? I was playing crystal a and made it to the crystal sector without having to name anyone.
ftlgame,3bg199,superfantastic1,3,Mon Jun 29 02:29:28 2015 UTC,"No, you don't. However if you don't rename him, the beacon to the Crystal Homeworlds won't display on the map, and you can only find it by chance."
ftlgame,3bg199,Gildedjandle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:34:04 2015 UTC,You can just rename them? Wow that's cool
ftlgame,3bg199,Snake101333,6,Wed Jul 1 19:39:43 2015 UTC,"If you are going to do it that way, then use a ship with rock plating. Do it on easy, and restart until you have a store next you with long range sensors in and buy them. Then play as normal to the end of sector one and check the map layout to see if the sectors you need can possibly happen. Check an other guide to find out what sectors you need to search for things (since I don't remember) and figure out what type of beacons the events are (again from a guide since I don't remember).  Now, there is an easier way, if you have the rock c ship unlocked use that and rename the crystal crew member to a certain name and go to the rock homeworlds. There should be a quest beacon so just go to it."
ftlgame,3bg199,Dude579,2,Sun Jun 28 22:29:34 2015 UTC,"For you, it'll probably be faster to finish off beating the game with A and B variants of everything but the Lanius cruiser. I'm guessing you already have a number of wins under your belt with 300 hours played, so it's probably just a couple ships you're missing?"
ftlgame,3bg199,51Gunner,2,Mon Jun 29 02:41:46 2015 UTC,To answer you question in the edit:  The stasis pod is not enough. The quest marker came from having a crystal crew member with the name Ruwen when you entered the Rock Homeworlds. And the wormhole was part of the quest marker text.

ftlgame,3bdri0,PastaRavioli,5,Sun Jun 28 06:53:08 2015 UTC,"Some other people already told you how to deal with the boarding drone and stuff, but I'd like to be a bit more detailed on how Piloting works, because it's definitely the most important system to have someone in at all times, and not having someone in there is really bad.  Your Engines give you a certain evasion bonus, based on the engine level and the experience of your crew members manning engines and piloting. You will lose your evasion chance if your piloting system is destroyed or if it's level 1 and no one is in it. Generally speaking the last thing should basically never happen in a fight.   If someone fights intruders or fixes a breach in the piloting system you lose out on the piloting manning bonus, but still get the full Evasion bonus from your engines. If at the point of your last screenshot, someone was in the piloting room, your evasion would've been 35% instead of 17%. 38% if you completely powered the engines. So really with the boarding drone disabled, the correct thing to do there would've been to send some people in there to deal with the breach and the drone (others already said how you could've get enough oxygen in the room, but even without that it's important to do it, because you won't win this fight with so low evasion."
ftlgame,3bdri0,Eirh,6,Sun Jun 28 13:21:00 2015 UTC,"I'll add Oxygen management to my to-do-list. Knowing certainly is half the battle!  On a side note, I found the Big Dipper in the Engi Homeworlds...does this mean something? (Lost Run) http://i.imgur.com/9dVtZdC.jpg"
ftlgame,3bdri0,ChummyCommie,2,Sun Jun 28 13:52:17 2015 UTC,"A tip on oxygen management: it's a privilege, not a right. You can always temporarily depower it to power up something else, like engine to give you some extra evasion without having to upgrade the reactor. But pay attention to your ship's oxygen level so it doesn't drop to low.    On a side note, that doesn't look like the Big Dipper to me. And no, beacon constellation doesn't mean anything."
ftlgame,3bdri0,mymindpsychee,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:37:49 2015 UTC,I think the Big Dipper comes from the Exit beacon and the 5 beacons that swing downwards and then back up.
ftlgame,3bdri0,mekloz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:14:59 2015 UTC,Is big dipper the big bear? I think that's what we call it. The one that if you count the back wall 5 times you can see the north star?
ftlgame,3bdri0,ChummyCommie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:02:29 2015 UTC,Yes. It's one of those constellations that have a different name in each language (in my language it also roughly translates to big bear).
ftlgame,3bdri0,Anistuffs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:30:43 2015 UTC,"First of all, you really should grab all the fuel from this store (12 scraps). Then patch up about 4-5 points of hull damage (12-15 scraps). That leaves you with about 170 scraps left. Cloaking is useful, but it cost too much and not really necessary. Personally, I would grab the BLII and spend the remaining scrap upgrading the ship and patch up some more hull damage. EDIT: Upgrade your engine first. Weapon system and shield can wait."
ftlgame,3bdri0,mekloz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:12:13 2015 UTC,What the others said. Cloaking isn't necessary this early. Patch up your hull and get fuel. And get that BL2. Now you have an endgame weapon loadout ready. Get cloaking or other systems at the next store.
ftlgame,3bdri0,mekloz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:20:27 2015 UTC,"Well, nice job getting to the flagship  anyway!  Did you cloak at the power surge? You should.  Also, don't abandon piloting. O2 second bar will keep breached  rooms oxygenated if you open internal doors.  And you might want to prioritize stuff like weapon bars and additional systems over the last shield bubble. It's way too expensive.  Good luck next time."
ftlgame,3bdri0,ChummyCommie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:19:24 2015 UTC,So 4th Shield is overrated? And how to deal with the Boarding Drone and my pilot? (+50 HP didn't help him :/)
ftlgame,3bdri0,mekloz,2,Sun Jun 28 10:52:25 2015 UTC,"To say overrated would be a bit much, but buying it while you have cloak to protect you from the more dangerous stuff (like surges), but don't have basic things like the ability to run all your weapons or multiple extra systems (every ship has 8 system slots + 4 subsystems) is not the best idea.  As for breach, like I said: power your oxygen fully, open the doors and hold out. Switch a crewman to another to heal the main one and then cycle them."
ftlgame,3bdjsh,Dude579,11,Sun Jun 28 05:05:34 2015 UTC,"Turning the beacon on on raises the chance of something happening, be it a good event or bad. Generally when you're out of fuel you want an event to happen and have a chance at fuel regardless, so I pretty much always turn it on."
ftlgame,3bdjsh,NickTM,2,Sun Jun 28 06:14:38 2015 UTC,"You can usually still get fuel out of a ""bad"" event anyway, you just need to fight an enemy ship first."

ftlgame,3bdjsh,PastaRavioli,3,Sun Jun 28 07:05:56 2015 UTC,"I've tried leaving the Beacon off before; not recommended. Way too much chance of nothing happening, which to me is the worst possible outcome."
ftlgame,3bdjsh,51Gunner,2,Sun Jun 28 21:24:45 2015 UTC,"If you feel you're in such a desperate situation that you need to have the Rebel Fleet delaying AND get some fuel from an event, leaving the beacon off could theoretically make sense, but I don't believe it makes sense for any standard situations."
ftlgame,3bdjsh,Twinge,2,Sun Jun 28 23:44:47 2015 UTC,"If you feel that you can reliably win a fight, and/or have scrap, you want to turn the beacon on. The beacon on events are mostly of the form ""a ship turns up, and offers to sell you fuel; you can buy the fuel or fight the ship to take it"". Sometimes you only get half this offer (i.e. only the option to buy, or only the option to take fuel). This is going to be the better option almost all the time.  Turning the beacon off is normally a bad idea. It's the higher-risk higher-reward option; the best possible result from this is that you get free fuel and the rebels are delayed 1 jump, which is better than anything that beacon-on would give you. If you're playing a pacifist game (these games are more likely to run out of fuel than normal ones), and you don't have a lot of scrap, you're going to want to turn the beacon off because most beacon-on events will be useless to you (you won't be able to buy fuel, and you can't take it from destroying ships because you're pacifist). However, beacon-off has a distressingly large proportion of blank beacons, which are more or less the last thing you want when low on fuel. In other words, beacon-off is for when you're already doing really badly."

Send a freshly cloned crewman to the piloting room. When he gets there, jump back to a previously explored (i.e. safe) node, healing him. Your second crewman will be cloned (L3 bay is 7s cooldown), send him to the O2 room. Keep jumping between the two safe nodes to heal both the pilot and the repair guy until the oxygen is fixed. This will cost you quite a bit of fuel but at least you'll be alive, and you have 18 in the tank which should be more than enough.  HTH"

ftlgame,3bc4sf,Always_d,3,Sun Jun 28 00:51:55 2015 UTC,The odds of that happening are crazy high. Your reaction was priceless. The question is though: Did you win with that ship??
ftlgame,3bcqk4,Gruntykins,3,Sat Jun 27 23:54:24 2015 UTC,Those Zoltan are just as bad as pirates most of the time.
ftlgame,3bcqk4,Bandit987,2,Sun Jun 28 16:51:55 2015 UTC,"Between the great first Sector I had, and now seeing this, I have high hopes this will be my first Flagship kill."
ftlgame,3bcqk4,Dude579,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:55:59 2015 UTC,Is there somethong I am supposed to see here?
ftlgame,3bcqk4,Jimmy_Nertron,3,Sun Jun 28 03:22:50 2015 UTC,"It's just a very ""green"" route. That normally doesn't happen to me."
ftlgame,3bcqk4,Dude579,5,Sun Jun 28 03:26:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly an all-green route isn't that great. You want a bit of both, generally more green early on and then red towards the end. The reason for that is that in general green sectors have more ""neutral"" beacons (shops, empty events, events without a fight) that give less rewards on average than the more dangerous red sectors."
ftlgame,3bcz9m,battlecatluke1,5,Sun Jun 28 01:22:37 2015 UTC,"I assume you are just about to go up against the flagship. Do you have Advanced Edition content turned on?  Focus all shots on the missiles room at first. It's going to be isolated the middle right room on the Flagship. Once you kill the guy in that room, they won't be able to repair it. Then focus on the Ion room on the far left and then the beam room on the far right but leave the laser room on the middle left. That's so that if you kill all the guys in the main area by sheer luck(fires and breeches), you won't activate the AI which will auto repair systems and make it much harder.  Once you get to the 3rd stage, divert power from one of the burst lasers to the heavy ion to take down the super shield as soon as possible.  These tips are a little late but you bought one too many levels of weapon power since you can't use all of it. You also put too much scrap into your reactor. You don't need to have your medbay and oxygen fully powered all the time but it was wise to upgrade them to level 2. Upgrade your engines to have a better chance against the missiles your shield won't protect you against. Then you can take power from the engines and put it in the medbay or oxygen when you need to. It's also good to upgrade piloting to level 2 so that you don't loose all evasion if it takes one damage.  If you get a breech and it's in a room that you won't have people passing through like the middle air locks, don't spend resources fixing it since the engie can take a different route to go fix things."
ftlgame,3bcz9m,SmartAlec105,2,Sun Jun 28 02:07:08 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks! I'll be sure to remember these on future runs!"
ftlgame,3bcz9m,Eirh,3,Sun Jun 28 02:26:15 2015 UTC,"Answered my own question. Yes it can! Didn't even use the Ion thingy, 'cause I didn't have enough power on my weapons to even use it. Oh well, it didn't matter, seeing as I rekt the flagship with about 5 health left and everything on fire."
ftlgame,3bcz9m,CommodoreYoshvaaard,3,Sun Jun 28 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"Congrats. I'll just assume this is without advanced edition content on (which is of course not a problem). On other settings the flagship will have 4 shield layers instead of the 3, which definitely would've made the fight much harder for your weapons. Definitely great that everything worked out though!"
ftlgame,3bcz9m,Dude579,2,Sun Jun 28 03:21:58 2015 UTC,"The sensors and doors can be manned, though. Doesn't that mean AE is on?"
ftlgame,3bcz9m,CommodoreYoshvaaard,5,Sun Jun 28 04:12:51 2015 UTC,"Turning AE on and off only adds and removes the new weapons, drones, systems, sub-systems, augments, ships, races, events/event options and sectors (I think I listed them all) that were added in the AE update. There were other things added to the game that can't be turn on and off such as doors and sensors being man-able."

ftlgame,3bcz9m,iThinkergoiMac,2,Sun Jun 28 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"That's the Kestrel B, which starts with 4 basic lasers, no BL2."
ftlgame,3bbr0n,AdamR53142,3,Sat Jun 27 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"THE STORY: I won, but only just barely because of my complete lack of captaining skill. I lost the boarding crew at the end of the first stage, because the flagship blew up just as I was teleporting them back. Sensors guy and doors guy replaced them. Next stage went smoothly. Cloaked through power surges, new boarding crew took out the flagship's missles, but I lost the Zoltan on engines to a boarding drone. The final stage was total chaos the whole way through, my entire ship was on fire, but the flagship was too. VICTORY DANCE"
ftlgame,3bbr0n,pm_me_your_shorts,2,Sat Jun 27 18:54:35 2015 UTC,"Well done, and the subsequent wins will be just as satisfying as the first :)  Something I've always been confused by in this sub, though: how come everyone's UI is slightly different? I don't mean the iPad version, but everyone who posts PC screenshots seems to have some subtle difference from mine. For yours it's the blue edging around the hull bar and other boxes.

ftlgame,3bcf9i,KamiForever,6,Sat Jun 27 22:06:30 2015 UTC,"The small bomb's job is to destroy pesky clone bays and medbays (and occasionally weapons or drone systems). Enemy ships have lousy (although occasionally nonzero) evade when nobody's piloting them. It's second only to Breach Bomb II or hacking in terms of supporting your boarders.  Zoltan ships are troublesome, but you can take all the time you need to if your defenses are good enough that they can't hurt you. Zoltan ships with just two or three lasers are no big deal, but be wary of Zoltan ships with Burst II/Flak I or big missiles. Don't be afraid to just run away from a scary opponent instead of trying to board them (although if they're only minorly dangerous, it's better to take a little hull damage to get some scrap for a store than to run away and be short on money).  If you play ships like Federation C or Slug B, you will greatly appreciate the weapons and crew you have on Mantis A."
ftlgame,3bcf9i,Leylite,2,Sat Jun 27 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"If you play ships like ... Slug B   Pretty much anything is better than Slug B, though."
ftlgame,3bcf9i,mymindpsychee,3,Sun Jun 28 04:32:59 2015 UTC,"At least Slug B has multiple crew members, with the ability to somewhat make up for a lack of sensors. Ahem Engi B."
ftlgame,3bcf9i,BepisChristmas,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:36:04 2015 UTC,"Actually beat the flagship on easy with the Engi B, it was ridiculously hard but those system repair drones are everything."
ftlgame,3bcf9i,Planetkillah,2,Wed Jul 1 22:24:34 2015 UTC,"You are not wrong in terms of terrible weapons but at the beginning you can small bomb the shields and your laser can get through. As soon as you come across any ship that you can't board and that has two shields can be trouble so it is important to find a weapon asap. Ion weapons can be useful for both boarding and destroying a ship as they can remove zolton shields and won't do hull damage so you boarding crew will be safe and alot of them can ion chain to remove shields for your other weapons to get through.   But from a boarding point of view the small bomb is fantastic, there are many things you can do with it. I am in the middle of a run on normal with this ship atm and small bomb has done work. Good strategies include bombing a room (piloting, medbay clonebay etc) then teleporting in to prevent repairing; and the other way too, teleporting out as you bomb a room to damage all the crew in the room (but you need to be careful with timings). As it doesn't do hull damage it is great for keeping the ship intact.  Also some systems can support boarding, hacking locks the doors into a room trapping enemies (try hacking a medbay with enemy crew in), mind control (obviously, making crew fight each other) and drones (boarding drone and ion intruder).  Also there are some great augments too: Reconstructive teleport (full heal on teleport), zolton shield bypass (exactly what it says) and back up DNA bank (depowered clone bay still remembers crew) with relieves worries of losing boarders.  I hope you can take something away from this scattered mess of advice and good luck."
ftlgame,3bcf9i,Dude579,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:07:34 2015 UTC,"One of the harder lessons I had to learn with the Boarding ships is that some fights are simply not for you. Don't be afraid to run from Zoltan ships and Auto-scouts if you have to, especially if they have missiles. It can easily cost as much in supplies to kill them and scrap spent repairing as you would have received for destroying them.   As to Medbays/Clonebays: that's what the Small Bomb is for. The Basic Laser offers you the option to finish off things like weaker autoscouts after you've bombed their shields."
ftlgame,3bcf9i,51Gunner,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:47:14 2015 UTC,So how would you guys approach doing the upgrades? Upgrade weapons first? or boarding? or even shields?
ftlgame,3bcf9i,mekloz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:39:03 2015 UTC,"Shields. They make you invulnerable to many ships; some of those will have medbays and the ability to board with all 4 crew and kill the medbay while distracting the enemy in the shield room (high priority for them) saves ammo and damage.  Then it's boarding, weapons system, medbay. As weapons go, though, the bomb is generally enough for a long time. What you want is support systems that will stop you taking damage while you kill the crew."
ftlgame,3bcf9i,Captain_Lord_Avalon,2,Sun Jun 28 10:13:12 2015 UTC,"I would say engines before medbay, maybe even before weapons. They help you dodge things and are initially cheaper than L2 weapons on a Mantis ship."
ftlgame,3bcpy4,Th3Stranger,3,Sat Jun 27 23:47:55 2015 UTC,"How deep in Sector 7 are you, and what kind of sector is it? I'm trying to gauge your odds of picking up another weapon.   Based on what you're carrying, I'd suggest running three more weapon power to charge up that Flak 2. Flak 1 + BL2 probably won't damage enemies on their own, and the Swarm missiles don't help the other weapons (unless you target shields with them). While ammo supplies last I'd try to run Swarm, Flak 2, and BL2. Every twenty-odd seconds the enemy will be hit with your Artillery Beam, a wave of flak stripping shields, 3 laser shots to try and kneecap a system, and missiles at your target of choice. If you want to conserve ammo (or run out), switch to Flak 1 + Flak 2 + BL2 and add the Flak 1's damage to large rooms to try and hurt them more.   Alternate plan could be to just let your Artillery beam kill the enemy & focus on defense. If you can find Drone control with a Defense drone, and then power up 4 shields and as many engines as you can, you'll be able to sit back and let the artillery kill everything."
ftlgame,3bcpy4,51Gunner,2,Sun Jun 28 00:38:49 2015 UTC,"In my opinion your best bet is to run the flak 2 and the burst laser 2 for now which gives you 7 spread shots (to hit first and take down the shields and maybe get a bit of damage in) and 3 accurate shots (to hit a system you need to damage).   Then if you decide to get for the weapons add the flak 1 into the mix giving you another three spread shots (small spread than flak 2) to get some more damage in. With 13 shots per volley you will do some heavy damage.  You could choose to get shields but I personally think that you defenses are good in those areas. To strenthen my defences I usually aim for either cloaking or defence drones to help out taking out missiles as well as 3 shields and 5 engines. But you may not get the chance to get either of them at this point.  My vote is for weapons, so that you can hit them hard as quickly as possible and therefore reducing the time a battle goes on for."
ftlgame,3bcpy4,Dude579,2,Sun Jun 28 03:47:33 2015 UTC,"Do you have anything you can sell in cargo? If you do and there's a chance to find a store before sector 8, I'd buy just one bar for weapons. That way you can have flak, BL2, and swarm missiles up for the time being.   I always really like to have cloaking with Fed A or B because it makes turtling for the artillery beam easier and the beam doesn't affect your cloak time, but it's expensive. Based on this screenshot it doesn't really look like you're hurting for system upgrades, so if there's a possibility to find cloaking in a store then you want to have enough scrap on hand to afford it and maybe even an immediate upgrade for it."
ftlgame,3bcpy4,BepisChristmas,2,Sun Jun 28 04:57:34 2015 UTC,"WHY does everyone recommend flak 2? You have neither cloak nor defense drone so you'll have to tank 2 enemy volleys before that thing can get off a single shot. Whereas BL2+flak1 still gives 6 projectiles, and you should also run the swarm for some backup firepower, or fire 3 at shields to cripple."
ftlgame,3bcpy4,Fergusmo88,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"It's too late. Lost in the second fight. :l   Managed to get 4 shields and flak 2, bl2 and swarm running.   I just kinda...suck. Back to the hangar!"
ftlgame,3bcpy4,Captain_Lord_Avalon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"I would've tried to get Cloaking. And Hacking. Maybe Drone Control. Sold off the Swarm and probably Flak II for different weapons.  If I couldn't find another store, then I'd probably go with BL2, Flak I & Swarm and upgraded Engines rather than Shields.  Oh, and L2 O2 right before meeting the boss, if I could afford it."

Probably shoulda invested in a better weapon at a shop or something at some point"

ftlgame,3b9q0j,gaflar,14,Sat Jun 27 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"Well, there's no record of any stock YT-1300 freighters, so I think it's safe to say that every ship is a heavily modified YT-1300 freighter. I mean, the only known specifications of a stock YT-1300 freighter are that it's a space ship, and that it has cargo holds. I think just about every space ship fits those specifications."
ftlgame,3b9q0j,ChummyCommie,8,Sat Jun 27 06:12:13 2015 UTC,I guess that means this is also a heavily modified YT-1300? Sounds legit.

ftlgame,3bbp48,gamer29020,2,Sat Jun 27 22:07:12 2015 UTC,"They're both from Captain's Edition. The Ion Phaser is slightly modified to take 2 power and the name is changed from what it's called in CE (Phase Ion) to this to make a reference to Star Trek (because I pestered Bio to do that). The ion phaser's projectile phases through all layers of shields, doing 1 ion damage to the shield system in the process and then it does another 1 ion damage to the system that the shot lands in.  The red one's the Plasma Thrower (I tried to make Bio rename it to Plasma Gun because Plasma Thrower sounds LAME). It basically fires flak projectiles that does 0 damage to shields, meaning they can't even be used to wipe shield layers. But when shields are down and it hits the ship, it will start fires (again, no actual damage at all). Kind of a weak weapon, hence the 1 power."

ftlgame,3baqtj,Alexkarino,10,Sat Jun 27 12:13:22 2015 UTC,When you play FTL you gotta know your ABCs man. Always Buy Cloaking.
ftlgame,3baqtj,probabilityEngine,3,Sat Jun 27 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd pick up cloaking, and maybe heavy laser depending on how I felt. Cloaking is always good, and the heavy laser really helps that loadout with taking down ships.  You could pick up teleporter if you want to go for a boarding run. (I generally don't when I play hard unless I have really strong boarding from the start.)"
ftlgame,3baqtj,Lunaria-Stalis,2,Sat Jun 27 12:44:31 2015 UTC,You might want to trade your Pike for the Hull beam and grab either Cloaking or Hacking. Personally I would go for Cloaking.
ftlgame,3baqtj,ChummyCommie,2,Sat Jun 27 12:56:55 2015 UTC,"I think cloaking, hacking, and/or maybe the Heavy Laser are the efficient purchases here.  Buying the Heavy Laser and upgrading your weapons system to run it also has the additional benefit of keeping your ion blasts + pike beam online should your weapons take 1 damage.  So I'd probably buy Cloaking and Heavy Laser here, then save up for more system upgrades. Hacking, while tempting and always very powerful, is kind of risky to buy this early in the game when you have this few drone parts."
ftlgame,3baqtj,Leylite,2,Sat Jun 27 13:20:34 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with cloaking here: using it with the zoltan shield really extends your 'free' time at the start of the fight.
ftlgame,3baqtj,mekloz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:47:40 2015 UTC,"Well i would definitely pick up the heavy laser or the hull beam since they pair so well with your weapon setup, personally i'd prefer heavy laser because it's good at directly targeting weapon systems once your ions get shields down and because of the price. You could pick up cloaking as well, for example, or just get it online right away."
ftlgame,3baqtj,braveplatypus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:11:21 2015 UTC,I know cloaking is tempting but I will be inclined to pick up both hacking and the hull beam.
ftlgame,3baqtj,Dude579,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:50:26 2015 UTC,"The Heavy Laser, for sure. Your Ion Blasts keep shields down and the Pike Beam does respectable damage across lots of rooms - the Heavy Laser will let you punch two damage and a hole/fire into any given system like weapons or shields to keep them down. If the Heavy Laser wasn't there, I'd consider the Small Bomb, but you don't have room in your loadout for both without dropping an Ion Blast.   The Cloaking device is a strong option too, it's a good combination with the Zoltan shield to make it last longer. You're a bit light on Drone Parts to make the Hacking System great right now, and you need another good boarder besides that Mantis to make a teleporter effective."

I looked around for all the traditional mistakes an all the bad habits that you pick up and get away with on Easy, but you put together a pretty strong ship there :(  I mean, no subsystems is a mistake. Cloaking when triggered after the enemy fires is an instant ""get out of jail free"" card versus missile barrages or a volley when your shields are down, unless your engines suck. It'll save you a lot of damage very often even when it doesn't outright win you a fight. Drone Control and a defense drone mk 1 is a strong counter to missiles and boarding drones, and enemy missiles are a huge problem; and if you don't have cloaking, a defense drone is upgraded from ""good"" to ""absolutely essential"". Teleporters are good because boarding is often effective, and killing the crew earns you more scrap then blowing up a ship; against the flagship that doesn't matter, but it's still a neat way to take out the individual weapons pods (there are no doors leading to them on Easy and Normal, so the rest of the flagships crew can't come help the individual gunners).   On AE, maxed Hacking against the flagship would allow you to utterly brutalise their shields early on as soon as you managed to slip a shot through to disable their defense drone, or if you turned the hacking on and off rapidly to ""crawl"" the Hacking drone past the defense drone, as it won't shoot it once it lands. Mind Control is mostly handy for boarders, but can counter enemy mind control, and if you time your weapon volley with a mind control on the enemy pilot and then fire before they send someone to fight/replace the controlled pilot, you can cut the flagship's evasion in half and slip more of your volley through."

ftlgame,3b8l79,Spacetime_Inspector,6,Fri Jun 26 21:09:56 2015 UTC,"Every ship mod can replace any ship you want it to. Here's how:  -Download a mod file, and rename the extension from .ftl to .zip -Open the zip folder, and look for a file called blueprints.xml.append. Open this file with a text editor that can handle XML; I personally use Notepad++. Avoid using Wordpad. -Look for the line that says <shipBlueprint name=""PLAYER_SHIP_HARD"" .... >. Replace ""PLAYER_SHIP_HARD"" (or whatever is already there) with ""PLAYER_SHIP_FED_2"" (Nisos) or ""PLAYER_SHIP_HARD_3"" (Kestrel C). -Rezip everything into a zip archive. -Change the extension from .zip to .ftl, and load as normal."
ftlgame,3b8l79,OurEngiFriend,3,Fri Jun 26 22:16:32 2015 UTC,"As OurEngiFriend has already said, you can make any ship move to the right slot.  If you don't mind being my guinea pig, here are 3 4 some simple mods that may simplify the process:  ShipSwap - ClassictoNisos.ftl  ShipSwap - LaniustoNisos.ftl  ShipSwap - TypeCtoNisos.ftl  ShipSwap - ClassictoSwallow.ftl  ShipSwap - LaniustoSwallow.ftl  ShipSwap - TypeCtoSwallow.ftl  They basically swap the last added ship into place of nisos if it's a classic A or B ship or a lanius ship, and into place of swallow if it's a AE type C ship. Any ship now.  Just don't use both the nisos mods at once, and remember to get the mod order right - put each right after the ship it's meant to work with. Only use one toSwallow and one toNisos.  Recommended mod order would be:  -A or B layout -ClassictoNisos/LaniustoNisos -C layout -TypeCtoSwallow  I'm not exactly sure what will happen if you add another ship after all that - I think it should work, but.. Well...  If you go for it, let me know if it works or if you need help or anything.  @edit  Also, the limitation that you can only put ships C in Swallow's spot and the rest in Nisos' comes from the file names in ftl (well, I haven't figured out a simple way to bypass it automatically, anyway). But if you really want two ships of the same kind at once, all you need to do is open the ftl archive and edit the name of the file:  _  If your ship is in a lanius spot and you want it in the swallow slot  change name from dlcblueprints.xml.append to dlcblueprintsoverwrite.xml.append  _  If your ship is in a classic spot and you want it in the swallow slot  change name from blueprints.xml.append to dlcblueprintsoverwrite.xml.append  _  If your ship is in a C spot and you want it in the nisos slot  change name from dlcblueprintsoverwrite.xml.append to blueprints.xml.append  @edit2  Swapping Type C ships to nisos actually works, as well - added above. So does classic/lanius to swallow now."

ftlgame,3b69k6,Berttheduck,6,Fri Jun 26 10:07:25 2015 UTC,"General consensus is that you can win almost any run; occasionally, you'll still get a run that's not salvageable or a first-jump gameover, but that happens rarely."

ftlgame,3b69k6,TheElegantMrThay,2,Sat Jun 27 04:32:26 2015 UTC,I once had a first jump with Engi B lead straight into a sun beacon with a mind control-equipped ship. The repair drones couldn't keep up and I couldn't charge the FTL in time.
ftlgame,3b69k6,Redsyi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:26:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is probably one way to construct a no-win scenario - on the first jump you have no good answer to that. In later jumps you might have level 2 piloting or some extra defenses, but on the first jump you just have to vent piloting (so it doesn't get destroyed by self-sabotage), then hope and pray."
ftlgame,3b69k6,Leylite,3,Sat Jun 27 13:23:49 2015 UTC,"Its definitely not possible to win every time on hard.  Awhile back, I had a scenario that I know was 100% unwinnable on normal.  It was the first or second jump in Crystal B.  I had no damage beforehand.  Stealth not dodging.. shields going down, fires started from the sun.  Every single shot hit and it hit the worst possible system.  I couldn't jump before I was dead.  The only thing to really argue about is exactly what percent of runs are winnable with each ship... because its not 100%."
ftlgame,3b69k6,chewbacca77,3,Fri Jun 26 13:18:57 2015 UTC,"It's not possible to win every time. As long as there is a random element, you can always get streaks of bad, bad luck and die horribly. You usually won't, but it can happen.  It's very uncommon for the game to not 'even out' in one way or another. It's long enough for that.  Technically, you could still fail at any point - things like evasion, sector maps (ugh) are still random, and you could be dealt a very bad hand.  The later in the game a loss happens, the harder it is to say whether 'bad luck' is at fault. That's because it's very hard to identify the 'wrong' and 'right' choices. A poor decision can win you the game with ease, but that doesn't make it 'correct'. There's a number of things people buy that are like that, like pre-igniter or SRA - it looks pretty when it works, but it's not exactly optimal most of the time.  I don't think it's possible to definitively determine the things you should do to win every single time, just increase your chances and hope that RNG doesn't decide to go completely against what you just did too many times.  What I can tell you is that even on hard, the game allows for a lot to go wrong (on average). Especially with AE, which adds some really good and not very luck dependent stuff. Basically, hacking."
ftlgame,3b69k6,mekloz,3,Fri Jun 26 14:04:11 2015 UTC,"I once won 10 times in a row on hard mode with different ships, and on the 11th game, I lost in the 2nd jump. Despite being ""good"" at the game, I have no idea what I do wrong when I lose. I can't say for sure if I lose to bad luck or bad play. Currently I have won 14 times in a row with 14 different ships.  I think somewhere around 700-800 hours is when you feel you can beat the game consistently on hard.  NoQuitt - won 28 times in a row with 28 different ships, had about 800 hours at the time.  DarkTwinge - currently 26 wins into his 28 game winstreak, 900+ hours.  Billy1Kirby - currently 15 wins into his 28 game winstreak, 700 hours.   I have heard someone (DarkTwinge maybe?) say that the game is winnable 97% of the time on hard, but really, I don't know at all. The only thing I know is that FTL does a bad job at letting you know exactly what you did wrong, or if you did anything wrong at all."
ftlgame,3b69k6,panda44444,3,Fri Jun 26 14:47:01 2015 UTC,"Every single playthrough at 100% perfection, no.  It's possible for a fight on the first jump to be unwinnable.  Your weapon shots can all miss, while enemy missiles and beams continually wipe out your shields and engines and piloting faster than you can repair, and kill you before the FTL is charged to flee.  But skillful play can indeed get very close to 100% on hard.  I win about 85% across all ships, and the best ones like Zoltan A probably would be over 99%.  I've had win streaks of up to 10, and can certainly see where it's possible to manage all 28 ships consecutively."
ftlgame,3b69k6,vikingerik,2,Fri Jun 26 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"It is possible and someone did it.   The only No Win scenario is if the enemy keeps your weapon (or you don't have enough weaponry, but then you kind of pull it on yourself) and Engine/Piloting down so you can't FTL away.

ftlgame,3b38j5,DarkPhoenix142,2,Thu Jun 25 22:02:29 2015 UTC,Those damn slugs. Always hack my ship.
ftlgame,3b72uh,Lord_of_the_Scums,3,Fri Jun 26 14:27:31 2015 UTC,Good job on unlocking the next ship!  There are a lot of ships out there with very different playstyles.  There ARE mods out there that allow an infinite mode.. but the concensus is that it kind of ruins the game.
ftlgame,3b72uh,chewbacca77,2,Fri Jun 26 14:37:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the compliment. I really like the second ship. I was looking for infinite mode if I EVER finish the game. See how long I can hold.

ftlgame,3b4c7s,selen93,6,Thu Jun 25 21:27:19 2015 UTC,"Got a Zoltan Shield Bypass early, so I decided to go for it. 3 of my crew members heroically sacrificed themself to destroy the last HP of each phase. Mantis ships are just pure fun."

ftlgame,3b4c7s,ColeIngram,3,Thu Jun 25 22:40:31 2015 UTC,true mantis style would be to sacrifice the token slave engi for the win

ftlgame,3b4c7s,never_safe_for_life,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:27:02 2015 UTC,gratz! That is a fun way to win.
ftlgame,3b4c7s,BepisChristmas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"I just ended up attempting this with the Basilisk on hard because I found a ZSB and a reconstructive teleport at the same store early, and eventually got a full 8-man crew of capable boarders (5 mantises, 1 human, and two rockmen). But I forgot that the hard flagship has rooms joining the laser and missiles, and the only weapon I had was a heavy laser 2.  It, uh, didn't end well at all. But holy crap was having eight boarders simultaneously on most of the ships I encountered on the way awesome."
ftlgame,3b4c7s,Fergusmo88,0,Sat Jun 27 01:50:18 2015 UTC,I guess boarding with this...was a BLAST!  No? Anyone?  ok...
ftlgame,3b70hf,nitro67,8,Fri Jun 26 14:09:25 2015 UTC,"First, you need to make sure you're boarding properly. There are some good guides, like Twinge's tips and tricks video series. Make sure you're not taking damage that wasn't necessary or losing crew.  Dance your crew, don't punch AP drones, beat down some doors so you can move around and not die if it comes to that.  Other than that, what ends your games? Mantis B has a bit different upgrade path than other ships. You want to start with a way to deal with zoltan shields/autoships, so a cheap weapon if you can get it and a level 2 teleporter (boarding auto ships).  After that, crew. This is a bit luck based when it comes to this ship, but you should be able to get a few, at least. Prioritize pirate, engi, civilian sectors (easy to fight, lots of shops/crew events). Avoid zoltan, abandoned, rebel, nebula ones (auto ships, green shields, no o2).  Engines are a bit lower priority due to the drone - with that and lvl 3 shields (sector 3-4, usually), you shouldn't have much trouble surviving."
ftlgame,3b70hf,mekloz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:23:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips! I'll look into fine tuning my boarding techniques.
ftlgame,3b70hf,chewbacca77,8,Fri Jun 26 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"Mantis B is regarded as one of the most powerful ships in the game.  Its the second best in my books..  It sounds like you're just having troubles with boarding.  If you're up against an Auto Scout that isn't a threat, send your boarding drone to finish it off.. It will take awhile, but it will be destroyed.  You'll need an efficient weapon to take care of Zoltan Shields.. Shoot for a Heavy Laser I, or and Ion Blast I.. Next up would be Flack I and Burst Laser II, but they require a system upgrade.  I talk a lot about boarding technique in my guide: A Practical Guide.  Its one of the sidebar links."
ftlgame,3b70hf,BepisChristmas,4,Fri Jun 26 14:29:28 2015 UTC,"Another good Zoltan shield killer is a beam drone because it fires quickly and never misses, although you'd have to put one of your other drones in storage to use it."
ftlgame,3b70hf,chewbacca77,2,Fri Jun 26 18:36:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I've read your guides... they're very helpful. In fact I credit my first win to your guides to help me identify the holes in my play style. I'll give your boarding guide a re-read. Thanks for the input.
ftlgame,3b70hf,BepisChristmas,2,Fri Jun 26 20:22:31 2015 UTC,Glad it helped! Let me know if you have any specific questions.
ftlgame,3b40xl,CommodoreYoshvaaard,3,Thu Jun 25 20:04:27 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed reading it :) I am not sure how close to canon it is since I don't fully know FTL lore but regardless I thought it felt easy to read and well formed.   Good Job :)
ftlgame,3b40xl,Dude579,2,Fri Jun 26 08:25:05 2015 UTC,lol noobs. Why would they waste missiles on an already incapacitated ship? Obviously neither captain knows how to play properly.  Also isn't Tuco supposed to be a fail pirate and not a colonel?
ftlgame,3b40xl,Fergusmo88,2,Fri Jun 26 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"Story adapted from similar piece set in Gæraaathinia, so missiles originally made more sense.  Ill have a piece explaining how rebel commander Tuco fits into my own headcanon written at some point."

ftlgame,3b3jn4,Imalostmerchant,9,Thu Jun 25 17:58:24 2015 UTC,Yep!  This makes upgrading them far more viable than otherwise.
ftlgame,3b3jn4,chewbacca77,11,Thu Jun 25 18:14:59 2015 UTC,"This whole time I've upgraded them while also upgrading my reactor, then 2 or three jumps later I go ""oh look I have extra power"".  How did I never put 2 and 2 together?"
ftlgame,3b3jn4,Leylite,4,Thu Jun 25 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"It's slightly misleading because you can't use Zoltan energy to protect those systems from ion damage - but it's still useful to have them in ""bar"" form to indicate how much damage they can take. Maybe they could be gray bars instead of green bars?"
ftlgame,3b3jn4,MrBookX,2,Thu Jun 25 19:13:14 2015 UTC,I was over 200 hours in when I decided to actually research the game. Turns out upgrading the piloting subsystem doesn't increase evade...
ftlgame,3b3jn4,SecureThruObscure,2,Fri Jun 26 01:11:11 2015 UTC,"unmanned evade, right?"
ftlgame,3b3jn4,parentheticalobject,3,Fri Jun 26 04:22:54 2015 UTC,"Although you should really never leave your piloting unmanned unless it's an extreme emergency, as the evasion from autopilot is horribly low. The upgrade is mainly useful because it provides a damage buffer for the system, so one stray missile doesn't leave you defenseless."
ftlgame,3b3jn4,SecureThruObscure,0,Fri Jun 26 23:32:14 2015 UTC,"If you're getting hit, you're don't it wrong!  Zoltan shield, fully upgraded cloak and full shields, maxed out pilot and maxed engines with a maxed engineer is where it's at!  Pew pew pew!"

Because the obvious way to try them is to just unlock them...  If you're not that patient though, you can probably find a save file somewhere that you can swap in for your current save that will have all the ships unlocked. I don't know where to find such a thing but there's probably one out there somewhere.  If you mean ships that are outside the base game, like the ones that are sometimes posted in this sub (i.e. truly modded ships, as your title would indicate), then you'll want to look up Slipstream Mod Manager"
ftlgame,3b4o34,Spacetime_Inspector,2,Fri Jun 26 01:03:08 2015 UTC,Or you could use a profile editor like FTL Profile Editor to change your save file. Make sure you back up your save file though.

ftlgame,3b2uhq,ChummyCommie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:23:24 2015 UTC,Should've kept the Breach. You got just one shot with either the Breach or charge Ion anyway but the Breach deals a lot more damage.
ftlgame,3b2uhq,ChummyCommie,3,Thu Jun 25 15:33:09 2015 UTC,I actually just depowered the charge ion for the last fight after it had 3 charges and then fired all 3 at the zoltan shield after firing flak and repowering it.
ftlgame,3b393a,ryan5w4,6,Thu Jun 25 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"You usually need to make a single run specifically dedicated to getting a single achievement - if you can then salvage that run into a winning run that beats the Flagship, so much the better.  Most achievements are relatively easy to get, but some of them are very difficult, either due to actual luck being required (moreso than just winning the game - I'm thinking of Kestrel's United Federation or Federation Cruiser's Diplomacy), or from legitimate difficulty in management (the Zoltan achievements in particular).  If you want help with a specific achievement I'm sure the forum would be happy to give you tips."
ftlgame,3b393a,Leylite,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks! For some reason, the Zoltan cruiser is always easiest for me. I've done a reset once, and the first ship (after engi) was the Zoltan, both times around. I also got B and C easiest."

ftlgame,3b393a,51Gunner,3,Thu Jun 25 17:12:45 2015 UTC,"Rock B is a real pain to unlock. The first achievement more or less requires that you convert the Rock A into a fire and boarding based ship; pure luck on getting the stuff you need. Hacking will help immensely though, to lock enemies into a burning room with your Rockmen. The Defense drone achievement requires you to find a ship with a defense drone before your missile supply runs out. You have to hope for an Engi ship or two (better yet, and Engi sector) early. The third achievement is to reach the Crystal sector... It's 3x more likely in a Rock ship, but still pretty unlikely."
ftlgame,3b393a,Ifyouseekey,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:25:45 2015 UTC,"How I got these achievements:  For the first one I bought a teleporter, then encountered a ship with a rock crew member. Fired an artemis missile at medbay, and the rocket set it on fire. Then I teleported my boarders. The thing is that the rock doesn't leave the room on fire if he has low health. Also he doesn't take the damage from fire, so the final damage was made by my crew, not the fire.  For the second one I got lucky and found a defense scrambler at one of the first stores. With it the destroying a ship with defense drone was easy. Also I'm not sure, but does destorying a ship with an Anti-Drone drone counts?  Well, the third one was unlocked using the Rock C ship :)"

Keep in mind that wireless communication is just a certain frequency of light, so it still takes quite a lot of time relative to the FTL drive. Now, I guess it would be possible to send a small, fast drone with the message onboard, but then, what if it gets intercepted? What if it needs to refuel? What if just gets unlucky and warps into an asteroid field?  So long story short, its just better to send it in a small manned cruiser all the way to the front lines."
ftlgame,3b265x,Tasuko3,9,Thu Jun 25 11:44:41 2015 UTC,"Especially considering the manned cruiser IS in fact a rather big ship that would be suited for the task of going toe-to-toe with the flagship it has intel on.

ftlgame,3b265x,Tasuko3,2,Thu Jun 25 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"Well think about it, they developed the technology to force MATTER faster than light. Not to force light to go faster."
ftlgame,3b265x,Leylite,5,Thu Jun 25 22:24:27 2015 UTC,"Based on some chatter in sector 8 implying the player ship has ""Federation command codes"", I like to think the player ship is manually carrying the other half of a one-time-pad or signature to both prove it's part of the Federation, and keep those pesky Rebel and pirate hackers from downloading the secret information and using it or selling it on the black market.  So, yes, we are the communication service."
ftlgame,3b265x,Dude579,4,Thu Jun 25 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"I assume it would be a serious risk to be broadcasting info like that which could be intercepted. If the rebels found out the federation knew their weakness, they would fix the issue."

ftlgame,3b265x,BepisChristmas,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:18:38 2015 UTC,"True. I'm only assuming encryption is still a thing in FTL because some events refer specifically to unencrypted signals or chatter between two ships, but who knows how advanced cryptanalysis is."

ftlgame,3b3mh7,Caeadas,7,Thu Jun 25 18:18:03 2015 UTC,"The differences in difficulty are in post-battle rewards and the difficulty of enemy ships. If you feel ready and want to bump it up, it's doable! You'll have to learn to be more efficient with your scrap (e.g. what augments are worth picking up and which are luxuries, when is it better to run than to fight) but otherwise it's the exact same game.  I'd go ahead and enable Advanced Edition. It adds more content which is interesting, but not so much that you'll be too burdened learning it. Some new players like to turn it on after putting in some playtime in order to stretch out the playability by making it ""fresh"" again.  In the end, it's a single player game and there's no right way to have fun. Try what you want!"
ftlgame,3b3mh7,Shiepdawg,6,Thu Jun 25 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"Based on my experience as a casual FTL player:  1) Play whatever you're most comfortably challenged by. If you're not sure about normal, just start a run. If it seems too challenging for you, just go back to easy. It's just a game; nobody else is going to judge you or care if you just play easy.  2) Similar to my first answer. Whenever you think you've got the basics down and/or want something more from the game. IMO the only more challenging thing about it is that it's a lot more information to learn and take into account in your runs."

ftlgame,3b1a7a,The_Sven,25,Thu Jun 25 04:02:06 2015 UTC,"I did some testing and this is what I discovered: Level 2 doors can survive 12 hits on easy, while levels 3 and 4 can survive 16 and 20 hits. One system bar can survive about 10 hits on any difficulty. All races deal the same amount of damage to doors. Combat experience also has no effect. (Both of these also apply to system damage.) Manning the doors while being attacked will add health proportionally to the current health e.g. manning level 2 doors on easy at 6 HP will add 2 HP. Hacked doors act as level 3 doors."
ftlgame,3b1a7a,Zakhep,9,Thu Jun 25 09:49:31 2015 UTC,"Afaik, door hp is dependent on difficulty. You might want to check that."
ftlgame,3b1a7a,Bloody_Lemon,13,Thu Jun 25 11:45:47 2015 UTC,"I just went ahead and ran tests for Normal and Hard. The number of hits required to break doors across Level 2-4 Doors on Normal is 8, 12 and 18. For Hard, it's 6, 10 and 15. It should also be noted that this applies for all doors, including enemy ships, which arguably makes boarding EASIER on Hard Mode, which is kind of comical."
ftlgame,3b1a7a,slowriderxcorps,5,Thu Jun 25 13:34:26 2015 UTC,I have tested these values on easy. I'll check tomorrow if they change depending on difficulty. Edit: Can confirm that door HP is reduced on higher difficulties.

ftlgame,3b1a7a,chewbacca77,4,Thu Jun 25 12:21:44 2015 UTC,"Note additionally that Crystal Lockdown freezes the door health at whatever it was at when you initiate the lockdown, so if boarders get halfway done beating down a door, then you lock it down, they must wait until the lockdown finishes and then beat down the remaining half before they can actually enter the room.  Thus, it's best to wait until several boarders are actively beating down the door before you activate the lockdown, as opposed to when nobody's even gotten there yet."
ftlgame,3b1a7a,Leylite,0,Thu Jun 25 11:40:03 2015 UTC,yes
ftlgame,3b1a7a,HSAccountThing,4,Thu Jun 25 04:21:55 2015 UTC,"Additive or proportionally?  To rephrase - suppose a door can take 10 hits before falling. It has taken 5 hits so will fall in 5 more. Also suppose that the next level of doors survives 20 hits (ie 10 more health, or double health). Which of the following is true:   If I man the doors then it's health will be 5(current)+10(next level)=15 more hits.  If I man the doors then it's health will double (since the next level is twice as strong) so it will fall in 5(current)*2(next level)=10 more hits."

ftlgame,3axxx3,General_Donger,34,Wed Jun 24 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"Flak are faster, cheaper and more common.   It's pretty easy to end up with a build including 2 or more Flak while you can easily got 3 runs without seing a single Burst Laser 2, that's the main reason imo."
ftlgame,3axxx3,Kuirem,12,Wed Jun 24 12:38:55 2015 UTC,"Flak II is great as a shield stripper.  It plays very nice with burst lasers and big beefy beams.  As a primary damage deliverer it's not great due to the spread.  Flak I is basically as good as a Burst II.  It's got 3 shots, putting it above the Burst I, and a good charge time putting it above the Burst III.  Having a competitive shots fired :: charge time ratio with the Burst II makes it a top tier weapon.  Some people might like the Flak I over the Burst II because it technically charges faster, but I would disagree with that assessment.  You're always going to be limited by your slowest weapon, which means that the charge time difference isn't important unless all you have to pair it with is Burst I / Basic Laser / Mini-beam.  Ideally you'd want to pair it with Halberd / Glaive / Burst IIs.  You could go gunship with all flaks, but there are disadvantages as the flak spread make it a slightly suboptimal damage deliverer and you could have trouble hitting 2x1 rooms."

ftlgame,3axxx3,_MadHatter,2,Wed Jun 24 13:45:43 2015 UTC,its all about them BL2s. Flak I are just easier to get and nearly as good.
ftlgame,3axxx3,Funklord_Toejam,5,Wed Jun 24 19:02:37 2015 UTC,It's just a starting weapon on a lot of ships and is almost never worth getting rid of.
ftlgame,3axxx3,lpscharen,31,Wed Jun 24 13:56:20 2015 UTC,"Well it is the best all-purpose gun if you don't consider full weapon combos such as Ion+Beams.  1) 3 shots (so potentially 3 shields bubbles) for 2 power is only bested by Flak guns 2) 3 damage for 2 power, most weapons that can do more damage per power unit have heavy restrictions (hull weapons), long cooldowns (beams), or need something to break shields as to not waste shots (heavy lasers). 3) Targeted shots means it's more versatile than Flak for dropping specific systems 2) Costing 2 powers to use makes it easy to slap on any ship and still prove useful.      Basically the burst 2 is good to pierce shields, snipe systems, and generally do damage at a somewhat short cooldown, along with being power-efficient enough that it can fit in any build, you can't get more versatile than that.  The downside is they are very very rare and somewhat costly."
ftlgame,3axxx3,Elr3d,2,Wed Jun 24 14:27:43 2015 UTC,"The only thing that bl2 beats flak 1 at is targeting specific systems, which is a huge difference, but your other three points (which all revolve it costing 2 power) are the exact same as for flak 1."
ftlgame,3axxx3,lpscharen,17,Wed Jun 24 14:51:16 2015 UTC,"The other big advantage I can think of is that BLII has a pretty good chance of starting fires, while flak has none. It doesn't sound like much, but setting your mantis enemies' weapons room on fire can turn the tide of a battle right quick."
ftlgame,3axxx3,Spacetime_Inspector,5,Wed Jun 24 15:14:22 2015 UTC,"That is a very good point. I had forgotten about the chance to start fires, but it is a huge bonus when it does."
ftlgame,3axxx3,lpscharen,3,Wed Jun 24 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah of course Flak I is a serious contender, but it's only because of availability and price. If Flak I was as rare as BLII, the latter would be considered as the superior option.  Flak is notoriously worse than BLII against specific ships, the fact it's better at shield dropping and have a bit faster cooldown doesn't make it better to me.  If I had to choose between one and the other it would be BL2 immediately."
ftlgame,3axxx3,Elr3d,3,Wed Jun 24 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"yeah same, i prefer lasers over flak for most situations, since it more reliably takes out systems. but flak is really good for its purpose, shredding shields"
ftlgame,3axxx3,Motorsagmannen,2,Wed Jun 24 15:37:17 2015 UTC,"I usually prefer BL2 as well, but if I have a good beam weapon, I would much rather have flak. The difference in the ability to drop shields is very noticeable when using beams. In pretty much any other case though, I will take BL2 because of the ability to target systems and the chance to start fires as /u/Spacetime_Inspector pointed out."
ftlgame,3axxx3,lpscharen,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"I would agree.  BL2 fires three shots in succession, so by the time the third shot hits and, presumably, takes down the last shield, the first shield has already recharged about a third of the way.  With a slow beam like glaive or halberd, this can mean that their first shield comes up before the beam reaches the last room.    Since flak takes down shields all at once, your beams get plenty of massacre time."
ftlgame,3axxx3,everybody_else,2,Wed Jun 24 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"It definitely used to be.. Now Flak I is probably considered the best.  Faster firing, cheaper, and much more common."
ftlgame,3axxx3,chewbacca77,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:23:37 2015 UTC,"BL2 beats out Flak I because of its better accuracy, chance to start fires, and the fact it can't be shot by Defense Drones, which I would argue is more valuable than the lower cooldown and slightly more compact timing on hitting shields (both of which rarely matter).  They're virtually identical weapons, though, and both stand tall amongst their peers.  (Notably, Adv. Flak is easily the single strongest weapon in the game, but it's only available on one ship and cannot be bought.  Dual Lasers and Mini-Beams also fall into this category.)"
ftlgame,3axxx3,Twinge,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:42:28 2015 UTC,"In a vacuum, it probably is. But the flak guns combine so well with so many weapons -- for reasons stated in other comments -- that they often end up forming a more powerful loadout."
ftlgame,3axxx3,justintnelson,8,Thu Jun 25 00:18:27 2015 UTC,"I like a combo of Flak 1s and burst 2s if possible. The timing is pretty good since Flak 1 is slightly faster, but the projectiles are slow so by the time they hit b2 is up to fire. Flak takes out the shields , then you laser down whatever system is giving you trouble. Flak can be meh for actually damaging systems since it's so random on it's hit pattern."
ftlgame,3axxx3,misterdave75,5,Wed Jun 24 14:12:29 2015 UTC,My first ever win was Kestrel 2x Flak1 + 2x Burst2.  Works great.
ftlgame,3axxx3,lordcirth,2,Wed Jun 24 15:46:27 2015 UTC,Sounds like easy mode. Ships would just melt aftee the first volly.
ftlgame,3axxx3,Amuro_Ray,3,Wed Jun 24 17:29:26 2015 UTC,"I think of flak as more of a supporting weapon (albeit a very good one that can potentially deal damage on its own). It pairs nicely with lasers and beams because it can bring multiple shields down simultaneously, but you need a lot of flak guns for it to be a viable damage-dealer by itself.  That said, Flak 1 is pretty much always a good buy. It's also cheaper and much easier to find than a lot of other high-tier weapons."
ftlgame,3axxx3,BepisChristmas,2,Wed Jun 24 15:26:11 2015 UTC,Because three shots for two power at a low cooldown is amazingly efficient. The inaccuracy isn't enough of a drawback to stop Flak 1 from being essentially a more commonplace BL2 that you can very often find multiples of.
ftlgame,3axxx3,corvid_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:28:47 2015 UTC,"I like lasers for precision strikes against important systems and just regular BnB damage dealing, but Flak cannons are just so much fun to wreak havoc with, and they absolutely destroy shields. Ideally I'd like to have both, but both function perfectly well standalone. I suppose ultimately Flak is more fun to play with, but that's just mainly personal preference."
ftlgame,3axxx3,Kafukator,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:01:28 2015 UTC,"The main advantage flak launchers have over laser weapons is the cost to get them from stores, you get a lot of damage for dirt cheap. If i own both and i'm out of slots i pick the laser, but to to get a setup good enough to beat the flagship on hard you usually need to buy some extra fire power."
ftlgame,3axxx3,braveplatypus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"flak I has 3 projectiles (meaning 3 potential enemy shield bubbles gone) as default, while the burst laser I only has 2. the cooldown between shots is also 1-2 seconds shorter than BL II, meaning if you have 2 flak Is, you reliably take down possibly 6 enemy shield bubbles every 10-ish seconds.  TLDR:    Great synergy (Lasers can do the heavy lifting while flak keeps shields down) Reasonable price. 65 scrap and only 2 energy bars for flak I is a-okay. reasonably common. You'll find a lot more flak Is than BL IIs"

If you still have upgrade potential, I'd focus on hooking up that chain ion instead of the breach, and getting that whole shield stripping, beam cutting setup running. If not, forget the beam and upgrade your reactor to get a defense drone online.   In the long run (I'm assuming you're around sector 6-7), you should upgrade your oxygen, piloting, and medbay in order to prevent the system from going down completely if it takes damage. Fully upgrade the reactor. You want to max out how much power you have, and then upgrade stuff past the point of usefulness. That way, if a system goes down while you're fighting the flagship, you can reroute the power to another attack strategy or defense strategy and hold your own.  Your main goal is fighting the flagship. Equip your ship to maximize its current strengths. Don't waste time changing strategy now.   And let us know if you win!"

ftlgame,3b0z0w,mrawesomesword,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:28:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  My vote is for selling the breach, and going in with his current weapons - they're incredibly powerful and fairly fast.  I'd probably put my scrap into damage buffers on piloting and oxygen.. maybe into drone control to have both drones running at the same time."
ftlgame,3b0z0w,chewbacca77,2,Thu Jun 25 12:25:43 2015 UTC,"Upgrade your piloting, oxygen, and medbay by 1. You should try to upgrade your piloting system to level two early in the game (after you get your second shield layer and maybe some engines) and then to 3 in the later game. These upgrades are essential to ensure that one stray laser beam doesn't knock out your evasion entirely, leaving you a sitting duck. Additionally, you need to upgrade your oxygen and medbay mid to late game. The oxygen upgrade will be a good damage buffer as well as quickly refilling after hull breaches and turning off life support for power. The upgraded medbay will be essential to defend against boarders (Phase 3 and you'll see what I mean.)   You should sell your defense drone MK I, seeing as you have three bars of power, and upgrading it would have you unable to upgrade one of the upgrades mentioned above and get another power bar for your defense drone. If you want to be very cautious you can maybe sell some of your stuff and forget some upgrades and get the hull repair drone, but you already have a good chance of winning if you handle your stuff right.   From what I see, if you manage your fight well enough, you've got nothing to worry about. I hope you win for the first time!"
ftlgame,3b0z0w,mrawesomesword,2,Thu Jun 25 03:38:19 2015 UTC,"You should try to upgrade your piloting system to level two early in the game (after you get your second shield layer and maybe some engines) and then to 3 in the later game   While upgrading piloting to level 2 is helpful, I disagree with it being an early game purchase and I disagree with also upgrading it to level 3 later.  Still, yes, /u/7up478 should upgrade it by 1 right now.   You should sell your defense drone MK I   This here though is awful advice.  The MK I defense drone is leagues better than the MK II defense drone.  If anything is going to be sold, make it that.    The MK I stops missiles.  The MK II will sometimes fail to shoot at missiles because it is shooting at lasers, lasers which would be stopped by your shield anyway.    My personal opinion:  Sell the Breach Missiles, sell the Defense II drone, upgrade all of your level 1 systems to level 2, then see what's left over.  If you can buy the Hull Repair drone, go for it and abuse it between flagship phases.  If you can't, then upgrade engines and reactor.  Another note for OP:  you don't have to have your medbay powered at all times.  That'll free up some power for you to use elsewhere."
ftlgame,3b0z0w,DiscordDraconequus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:55:10 2015 UTC,"The only thing I kind of disagree with here is selling the Defense I drone..  If there are times when missiles and lasers are coming at you at the same time, power it instead of the Defense II drone."

ftlgame,3b0z0w,dryerlintcompelsyou,3,Thu Jun 25 05:24:57 2015 UTC,"Both flak will be spent on breaking shields, leaving only halberd to do damage. That's 8 damage every 14-15 seconds, which isn't bad, but can still result in disaster if something goes wrong. Also, why hack missiles when both zoltan shield AND lvl3 cloaking protects against it for over a minute? Instead, hacking shields results in 6 projectiles + 2 damage beam completely destroying shields, enabling you to space shotgun the thing to death. Also halberd missiles-shields-piloting if you're that worried about tanking more than a single missile volley; you can survive 2 damage-free with cloaking and zoltan shield.  Also, sell breach missiles and buy charge ion. Will make taking down zoltan shield much easier in stage 3."
ftlgame,3b0z0w,Fergusmo88,2,Thu Jun 25 06:46:15 2015 UTC,"I'd generally agree with the hacking, it'd make things faster, but I'm not sure if the scrap wouldn't be better spent on stuff like piloting and more power here - it will brake 3 layers anyway. I wouldn't buy charge ion, either - I'd actually sell both breach and DRA, too, and just put more points into upgrades. Definitely oxygen, maybe 2 point of drones if it's enough. If not, sell one drone, upgrade power or doors or engines. Piloting would probably go first.  Most important thing here is the fight itself rather than upgrades, which are already mostly fine. Knowing to use cloaking lvl 1 against power surges, not panicking to 3rd stages boarding swarm, using flak to get the hacking past defense drone, jumping away if enemy hacking hits a bad system. Those are problems that can get serious when facing the flagship for the first time. If you really want to win this, you might want to read a guide or two on the flagship. There is a lot of good information around, probably better put together than anything I could write here.  I suppose it depends whether you want to see it for yourself or don't mind spoiling a little bit for the win."
ftlgame,3b0z0w,mekloz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:24:48 2015 UTC,"that is a killer setup. you may as well want that hull repair drone, as you have defense ones and so many drones to use. hull is the number one biggest thing to just fuck your run up, even with the best setups, because if you don't repair first, and he gets those few lucky hits, you are in deep trouble. take power out of the engines and put them into drones. when the battle is over power the defense II down and start using some hull repairs. sell the defense I."
ftlgame,3b0z0w,Luigigames,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:13:02 2015 UTC,"I'm basing this advice on the assumption that you're in a last store in Sector 7, and finding the one store in Sector 8 is uncommon and purely luck based.   First off, sell the Breach missiles. 2x Flak + Halberd beam is a winning setup for weapons; the Breach missile doesn't really fit. It won't do a damn thing for you in phase 2 anyway, and with your current load out that'll be the hard one. Sell your Drone Recovery Arm too, as you have enough drone parts to last the rest of the game now. Sell the defense drone 2: it's neat to be able to shoot down lasers, but the drone's main job is missile defense and it neglects that sometimes.   I am a fan of the Backup Battery - for 35 Scrap you can power up your defense drone without having to depower anything else. Get the Hull Repair drone too. Grab the Long-Range scanners if you can afford them. The rest of the Scrap I'd advise you hold on to and try to get your shields up to 4 bubbles.   Hopefully, you can plot a route through sector 8 which nets many fights and swings by a Repair station or two for free scrap, repair, and re supply. Good luck!"
ftlgame,3azx32,51Gunner,3,Wed Jun 24 21:13:49 2015 UTC,"So, I'm having a damn good Red-Tail run and I'm curious how the rest of Reddit would upgrade from here. As far as I can tell, there's two very solid upgrade paths available here:  A) Keep the Vulcan, and focus on running that. Upgrade and use Hacking to prevent enemy weapons from doing much before I can get the Vulcan spun up. Buy and use the Small Bomb and/or the Swarm missiles to disable key systems while I wait for Vulcan.  B) Scrap Vulcan, continue running weapon combination above. Maybe pick up Small Bomb for some system-sniping, but otherwise rock on.  For reference: I'm at the end of sector 5. Page 2 of that store only has Cloaking and a Teleporter. I bought the Mind Control system there as I ♥ Mind Control."
ftlgame,3azx32,slowriderxcorps,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:14:00 2015 UTC,"Followup: Decided to run the Vulcan & picked up Cloaking. That cost me pretty much all of my scrap & proceeds from sales. Kept the Heavy Laser 1. Ultimately ended up rocking a Small Bomb, Heavy Laser 1, and Vulcan. Got super-lucky and started next to the Store in Sector 8, where I traded out my augments and some spare scrap to get Preigniter and two Reverse Ion Fields.   I won pretty easily, but was reminded why I don't really like the Vulcan - getting the gun spun up and getting your enemy down to 0/4 shields leads to heartbreak when you have a string of misses and the shields come right back up."
ftlgame,3azx32,mekloz,2,Sat Jun 27 01:22:03 2015 UTC,"For running a Vulcan, you defenses at this stage of the game are more than acceptable, although Cloaking would help significantly with that if you can get hold of it. Unless you're willing to cheese the game with the HPE, the current loadout of weapons is only 'passable' in terms of effectiveness: your damage is okay because of the Heavy Laser but your Shield-Breaking capacity is going to become sketchy near the end of the run.  As for Vulcan 101, focus all your weapons fire on the enemy Engines to hold them in place while the Vulcan mercilessly crushes them into a fine paste. Having your Basic and Heavy Lasers as additional shield-punching power will help it nicely in doing this, and if you need to, you can use Mind Control or an Engines hack to disrupt their evasion more than long enough to catch them in a stranglehold."
ftlgame,3azx32,burning1rr,2,Wed Jun 24 21:27:32 2015 UTC,"Vulcan's pretty  rare, so I'd go for it when actually given a chance to make it work well. It's fun.

ftlgame,3azx32,Elr3d,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"I always have had fun with Vulcan, and enjoy trying to run it when I have a chance. You have enough weapons buffer to make it useful.  One advantage of your rig: You can trade the basic laser for your vulcan, which allows you to fall back to your existing guns if need be.  Long term, I'd be looking for small bombs and other weapons that can be used to disable enemy ships. Cloak would be a good add-on as well.  Use hacking strategically; disable weapons, engines, etc. Vulcan is a great shield buster; you won't need hacking to take down shields with it spun up."
ftlgame,3azx32,Luigigames,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:05:50 2015 UTC,"Small bomb, Hull Laser II, Heavy Laser I and Vulcan would be my goal setup in your situation. While the Vulcan is spinning up, you spam small bombs at critical systems such as weapons or drones, whatever they have that can damage you. You can probably sneak a few Hull Laser II shots when synced with the Vulcan charging up, but once it's spun and shields are down, switch small bomb to Heavy Laser I, and then Hull Laser II and Heavy Laser I means whatever you're up against doesnt have long to live.  Try to shot for a cloaking system for extra safety though, you never know, and few things are more heartbreaking than a charged Vulcan going down (unless it's an enemy one)"

ftlgame,3b0fb6,Dude579,2,Thu Jun 25 13:08:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are different. However, you'd be surprised to know that the Breach is actually slightly shorter than the Hermes. Breach missile has a slightly wider mid section with 3 red dots on each side. Hermes has a pair of small fins at its tail."
ftlgame,3b0fb6,ChummyCommie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:49:50 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind having your browser open while you play, you could always pause the game and then check this wiki page to identify what the enemy weapon is.  http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/Weapons  Eventually, yeah, if you play this game long enough you will start to automatically memorize what weapons look like."

ftlgame,3ayu0c,BepisChristmas,5,Wed Jun 24 16:26:54 2015 UTC,"I don't see anything bad about this plan. All those weapons knock down shields and do Hull damage too (except Flak, that's your shield-breaker?) so you shouldn't run into trouble that way.   Unlike fire though, hull breaches don't spread out of control. I suppose the low oxygen will force enemy crew to stop repairing eventually and will slow system repair, but this will be hard to plan around."
ftlgame,3ayu0c,51Gunner,2,Wed Jun 24 17:10:48 2015 UTC,"I actually put another power into my weapons shortly after I took this so I could replace the flak with the hull laser 2. It seems to work well.   One thing I like about breaches over fire is that you can't accidentally destroy a ship with them, which is nice if you're trying to kill off the crew for a better reward. On the other hand I don't have a useful way to disable systems without also causing (potentially lots of) hull damage here. I kind of wish I had a breach bomb, or hacking instead of drones or cloaking so I could have an easier time killing crews by taking out their oxygen, but I'm already in sector 7 for this run so I probably wouldn't profit much from doing that even if I could.  Edit: Welp, the flagship killed me. The freaking boarding drone got past my defense drone twice in a row, and the second one landed in piloting. My rockman pilot was stuck in the clone bay so my evasion got sabotaged and the drone surges basically ripped me a new one. Probably should have ditched the crystal heavy for the flak so I'd have something at least slightly useful against their defense drone (or had my defense drone not drop the ball TWICE IN A ROW)."
ftlgame,3ayu0c,ManiacEkul,5,Wed Jun 24 17:33:07 2015 UTC,I always wondered why there wasn't a fire beam equivalent that just caused breaches in a line to unshielded ships.  I guess that's what modding is for.
ftlgame,3ayu0c,kendrone,3,Wed Jun 24 17:47:42 2015 UTC,"I suppose each weapon type has its inabilities. Bombs cannot cause hull damage, missiles don't do ion damage, beams don't cause breaches, lasers... also don't do ion damage, if you consider ion weapons separate."
ftlgame,3ayu0c,sswalni,2,Wed Jun 24 19:46:49 2015 UTC,Interesting idea but it isn't really effective against Slug ships (they still die from the damage though)

ftlgame,3awrpe,BattleAtron,18,Wed Jun 24 03:09:51 2015 UTC,"Things that a lot of people forget to consider:  1.) If a fight is looking rough, you can always just leave. This sounds like a no-brainer, but I remember playing normal mode at 200+ hours before I remembered that you could jump to the next beacon in your chain, fleeing to win another day. That being said...  2.) Make sure your engines are pretty good. I don't mean making them out first, but each dodged attack increases the level of your engines-assigned unit and your pilot, eventually giving them more dodge chances. Increased engines also charge your FTL drive faster, making it easier for an escape-jump if needed.   3.) Upgrade doors to level 2 before Sector 2 if you're doing well, before sector 3 if you're not doing so hot. That will buy you more time to vent air out of the rooms enemies teleport into and/or move your units into better positions to fight them off.  4.) Shields are fantastic, and you should upgrade them as quickly as possible, but if you start with a three-unit ship, you should put the third unit on guns instead, as weapons cooldown rate is more important. Taking out earlier enemies before they do too much damage is more cost effective than trying to negate the damage, because rockets and mines pass through shields.   5.) Most importantly, try not to stick to one specialization, especially early on, due to the random nature of the game sometimes throwing all kinds of threats and rewards at you. You could build your ship to be drones heavy and turtle, but the game ends up not giving you opportunities to get great turrets.   P.S.: Always buy Scrap Recovery Arm, even as far into your run as Sector 6. The cost could be made up in as little as four fights depending on mode. Hell, get two if you get that lucky.   P.P.S.: Multiple Flak cannons plus the Weapons Pre-igniter will shred most enemy ships to pieces."
ftlgame,3awrpe,TheCakest,3,Wed Jun 24 05:45:36 2015 UTC,I'll also shuffle a crew member into my doors room if I can spare them while being boarded.  Gives you a few extra seconds for the enemy to suffocate.  Some ships I'll leave mostly vented if the layout makes that practical.
ftlgame,3awrpe,GoonCommaThe,4,Wed Jun 24 09:03:44 2015 UTC,"I usually put my fourth crew member on doors to start and then if it's not needed move him to shields. That way if it's an event where I start out being boarded, I'm safer."

ftlgame,3awrpe,Marsdreamer,2,Wed Jun 24 13:28:46 2015 UTC,"Might I suggest using the Zoltan A or B.  Both are incredibly powerful early on (thanks to the Zoltan Shield).   For the Zoltan A, you'll want to prioritize your Engines first, as every point in engines multiplies the longevity of your Zoltan shield.  Throw your first ~80 scrap into your engines getting 1 or 2 points early and then get an extra point in Weapons so that you can use your Leto with the Halbard Beam and not have to switch.   Early on you can just use your Halbard, as the Sector 1 and 2 ships are small fries that burn up quick to well placed beam shots. By middle of Sector 2 you should have a couple points in Engines, a point in Weapons, and your second shield bubble. Now you just want to upgrade your Doors System and then stockpile your scrap until you find good weapons to replace your Leto. You're looking for things to take down enemy shields such as Flak, Burst Lasers, Ion Bombs/Ion weapons so that your Halbard can do the heavy lifting. Try not to rely on missiles and keep stock of your supplies if you're using bombs. ONLY use bombs and missiles if it's a target that requires it. Each encounter is like a mini puzzle where you maximize your reward gain and minimize resources used (think of your health also, as a resource)  You really don't need much to breeze through sectors 3 - 5 as this is before the sharp difficulty rise. Remember to fight as often as possible when you're feeling strong (Which the Zoltan A excels at early). Just keep the rebel fleet 1 jump distance away so that you explore as many beacons as possible in each sector before moving on. More Beacons = More Scrap.   Late game I (personally) heavily rely on Cloaking so keep a strong eye out for it in the mid game, it's well worth the 150 scrap even for level 1. With cloaking, high level engines, a Halbard and some shield breakers, the flagship should be mince meat for you.   And everyone's said it, I've said. Do. Not. Underestimate. Engines. I once beat the flagship with only 1 shield bubble on the Zoltan B because of high evasion and cloaking."
ftlgame,3awrpe,GATTACABear,6,Wed Jun 24 13:01:23 2015 UTC,Have you tried pausing with space bar? That is a huge dividing line for people. With pausing/knowledge of the game it is hard not to win at some point on easy.
ftlgame,3awrpe,pm_me_your_shorts,2,Wed Jun 24 03:33:33 2015 UTC,Yep. Often I pause before even closing the dialogue before the battle to get a handle on the situation.
ftlgame,3awrpe,51Gunner,7,Wed Jun 24 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"You're probably still not pausing enough. I probably spend 97% of my time in game paused, and in even slightly hairy firefights I will double-tap the spacebar to advance by a fraction of a second, and do that repeatedly so I can time my shots perfectly between their shields. I never click without pausing first."
ftlgame,3awrpe,Salindurthas,6,Wed Jun 24 08:52:26 2015 UTC,"Don't get discouraged! This game is hard, so winning on any difficulty will be an accomplishment. Without knowing much about how you play (other than being on Easy), I can only offer a few generic tips.   First off, you'll never know what any given beacon brings. Regardless of what ship you play, you'll have to try to be ready for anything. Experience will show you that the strongest ships are prepared for nearly anything, while a weak ship is always hoping for SOMETHING not to happen.   Pause is a nice resource which lets you size up situations. Abuse this privelege.   Remember that you're playing the long game. You have 8 sectors to complete and should try to get everything possible out of each of them. Disabling enemy weapons before shields might make each fight longer, but it'll save you in attrition eventually. An upgrade for your medbay might not sound exciting, but can reveal many better resolutions to events.   Finally, give your game plan a review in your head. How is it that you kill enemies? List the steps to yourself in your head. Is it as simple as ""fire at enemy weapons, then annihilate smiles and finish?"" Or is it a multistep program relying on many good hits and not running out of bombs or drone parts?"
ftlgame,3awrpe,Jimli_,5,Wed Jun 24 04:37:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm, perhaps there are a few tactics you are unaware of that cause you to lose too often. It is hard to pinpoint them, so I'll ask some probing questions.  How confident are you of having your crew survive when you get boarded? Enemy boarders alone should pose no threat. That is, when you get boarded and there is no enemy ship to mess you up then usually it should be close to trivial to take literally zero loses from that boarding action (no hull damage or dead crew). (That said, boarders combined with an enemy ship can sometimes pose a problem, but knowing how to deal with boarders when they are alone often helps you find a solution when under fire from a ship.)  How do you choose to navigate through a sector? Note that you typically want to visit as many beacons as you can before the fleet overruns the sector. That is because the average result of a beacon is that you come out stronger (ie, with more scrap or other resources).  Have you ever reached the flagship? How does it defeat you? It has 3 stages, does one of those stages seem impossible?  Do you find enemy rockets/missiles too often wreck you? Is there some pattern(s) to some/many of your losses? (eg ""I can't survive asteroid fields"" or ""enemy drones are impossible to beat"")"
ftlgame,3awrpe,reformedgeek,5,Wed Jun 24 06:50:51 2015 UTC,"Everyone has basically mentioned everything of use, however I would like to mention that your ability to win goes beyond gameplay.

ftlgame,3awrpe,Ray661,2,Wed Jun 24 08:18:15 2015 UTC,"Try pausing ALOT more, it took me a few tries to understand how mechanics work, I pause after every enemy weapon shot (to figure out the highest percentage of negating hull damage in that moment), every time one of my weapons is fully charged (Don't use auto-fire except on ion cannons usually). Every time you pause analyze each situation to prevent hull damage as it can be a huge waste of scrap to repair. A longer fight is always better than hull damage.  Providing a screen shot of your ship a few sectors in could help us help you narrow down any problems your making, regarding ship building."

ftlgame,3awrpe,Acedin,2,Wed Jun 24 06:52:17 2015 UTC,"Biggest thing I found was maximising the number of jumps you can make. If you can leave with the fleet JUST behind you, then you've got all you can out of that sector.  Keep an eye out for the shops and try to jump to as many locations as possible before hitting the shop so you have a lot of scrap to work with.  Upgrade your engines and shields early, you can get by in most fights with just 3 power in the weapon systems."
ftlgame,3awrpe,ijnokmp,2,Wed Jun 24 10:08:34 2015 UTC,1)Sidebar-Guides are gold. Read them.  2)Shoot all weapos that are not ions/rockets/bombs in volleys. this way shields affect your damage less.  3)For most ships getting 2 shield bubbles + Engines 3 is a good first goal. Upgrade you defense right before you start taking damage again. In between you can upgrade stuff like sensors or Medbay which result in more scrap/crew by unlocking blue events.  4)Stay as long in a sector as you can without jumping the same beacon twice or getting caught by the rebels. You'll grow stronger this way.  5)Try different options for the same events and start building knowledge on which option has what consequence(s). This way you will know which option you favor in certain situations.  6)Each fight figure out whether you are in a leading position or the enemy is. If he has weapons that can harm you: prioritise shutting them down.  7)Think about why you lost. Don't do that again.

ftlgame,3awrpe,everyonelovescake,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:38:27 2015 UTC,"Not regularly posting on this subreddit, but I've got nothing to do so...  What are you playing on? I play PC, and find it a LOT easier compared to an iPad because of the hotkeys. That said, the hotkeys are pretty neat. Pretty much the A key for more power to engines, S for shields, and the keys more to the right for systems more to the right! Hold shift to decrease power. Hotkeys are not required of course but they can speed up your time spent in paused mode.  The key to FTL is always pause, regularly upgrading engines/shields, and finding good enough weapons to survive the later sectors and deal with the Flagship (this is where RNG can screw you over, however most games are winnable on Easy).  Maybe give us some information on where you lose? The earlier sectors are not too bad if you upgrade your Engines one or two tiers, than shields, engines one tier again and go from there.  The Flagship requires a bit of strategy to keep his rocket system down. Once you do that he can be beaten pretty easily. The easiest way to do this is to just teleport two men in, and once they're done they can fuck up another system, if you can't get the damage done soon enough that is.  Also, remember to upgrade your oxygen to at least lvl 2 before you face the Flagship. If you don't, he may hack your oxygen and kill your whole crew before you can do anything about it. That said, if he hacks your weapons or shields, just jump away and jump back, he will hack something else. Something like Sensors or Medbay is perfect, Engine doesn't have to be too bad if you can get his weapons down soon enough.  FTL is hard, but it shouldn't be that hard tbh. But we're here to help you, so there's that! :)"
ftlgame,3awrpe,BepisChristmas,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:31:01 2015 UTC,"Systems to upgrade in decreasing level of priority: Shields, Weapons, Doors, Engines, Oxygen/Medbay/Cloning/Hacking/Mind control/Cloaking, Sensors (at least level 2 or level 1 is enough if there's a guy handling the system) UPGRADE YOUR REACTORS TO FULL Lasers, lasers, lasers. Don't bother with ion/missiles (unless it's swarm missiles, but still LASERS FIRST). Flaks are also fine. Don't fire them as soon as they're charged, wait for all of them to charge first and fire all at once. It'll guarantee some damage. Recommended drones: Defence, hull repair, anti-drone, anti-personnel  Upgrade each system as much as you can Don't waste money buying crew! Just get them for free. Also if there's an enemy ship with weapons that can never penetrate your shield (aka beams or weak lasers) then just let the enemy hit you! Train your crew this way. Familiarise yourself with each stage of the flagship. Distribute your power accordingly. First stage is purely weapons and cloaking, so focus on first taking out the shields system, then followed by the missile system. Have your defence and hull repair drone (if necessary) on.  Max out your engines so there's a high chance you'll evade your enemy missiles. Also try to kill the guy in the missiles system because once he dies he'll not appear in the future stages which will be really helpful. Second stage has lots of attack drones so make sure you have your anti-drone drone on. It will be really helpful because it can disable a couple of the attack drones each time. Again, take out shields first, then missiles, then drones and other systems. Kill as many crew as you can but make sure you don't kill all of them or the ship will go into auto-pilot and that's really annoying. Third stage has a zoltan shield and intruder drones. Have your anti-personnel drone on and fire all your weapons immediately after they're charged to take out the zoltan shield as quickly as possible. Then go back to firing them all at once. At this point don't bother too much with keeping your crew alive (but still keep at least 3 or more alive or else it's quite dangerous). This time also take out the lasers system after taking out missiles because that's the main pain in this stage. Most importantly, don't panic and have fun :) Hope this helps, share your good news if you win!  ps. my favourite ship is the shrike (Lanius B). Have won everytime I used that ship."
ftlgame,3awrpe,SmartAlec105,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:18:37 2015 UTC,"Aside from reading the sidebar guides, one thing that I think helped me a lot but a lot of people don't seem to talk about often was watching other people's playthroughs on Youtube. It's a great way to learn strategies and how to assess situations so you can make the best (or least bad) decisions. There's a Youtuber called Fifth Horseman (his Youtube handle is HMV Plays) who has 170+ videos of playthroughs with most if not all of the ships in the game. Not all of them are successful, but he's entertaining and his playthroughs are generally a great way to learn events and weapons. Which, incidentally, is a nice segue into some other tips.  Look at the enemy's weapons and learn: what each one looks like; how many shots it fires; and, at least roughly, how long its cooldown is. Pretty much every weapon has a unique and identifiable appearance. Remembering these details allows you to know how much power you need to put into shields and engines, and then any leftover power can go into other systems to make the fight quicker. If a ship has nothing but weak beams and a missile launcher, for example, you don't need more than one shield powered. In this situation, it's best to power down your shields to 1 then put any excess power into your engines, or a defense drone if you have one.  Learn the outcomes of the various choices for random events, and read the text. So many of my early runs went south almost immediately because I was being dumb and impatient and would just hotkey through stuff (thinking back now, I don't really know what I was expecting by doing this).  Speaking of hotkeys, if you use them a lot during fights, consider disabling them for events, or at least delaying them (go to Options > Gameplay > Event choice selection). Nothing is more frustrating than accidentally accepting a lousy surrender from a ship you're almost done killing because you happened to press ""1"" before you could even process a text window appearing on the screen."

ftlgame,3atigm,liquoranwhores,4,Tue Jun 23 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"It's more of a precaution in the rare case it gets hacked than something you'll routinely need. For 25 scrap, though, it's usually worth it."
ftlgame,3atigm,mekloz,-2,Tue Jun 23 19:57:14 2015 UTC,"It's not the scrap, it's the power it requires."
ftlgame,3atigm,liquoranwhores,3,Tue Jun 23 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"You only need to power it at level two if its actually hacked. Otherwise, just power it at level one kike normal"
ftlgame,3atigm,CommodoreYoshvaaard,2,Tue Jun 23 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"Power's actually better - you can power it for 2 when you don't need it anywhere else (engines) so it recharges more, and then when you do need it, you have less to worry about with oxygen turned off.  Breaches aren't a problem either, or lanius boarders. I like upgrading oxygen, it's cheap and convenient."
ftlgame,3atigm,mekloz,2,Tue Jun 23 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'll start upgrading it on my next play. You make great points that never really occurred to me."
ftlgame,3atigm,liquoranwhores,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:55:50 2015 UTC,"Cool, but remember that there are still a lot of things to put your scrap in that can be much more important. Not sure what difficulty you're on, but on hard, especially, you want to hold off on anything that's not completely necessary, and oxygen doesn't really count as one of those things."
ftlgame,3atigm,mekloz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"You don't need to power it to level two except in extreme cases. It is generally a damage buffer to keep the o2 on when a stray shot hits it, since principle with the piloting system."
ftlgame,3atigm,Dude579,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:00:42 2015 UTC,I actually like to upgrade oxygen over reactor early in the game. Oxygen costs 10 more scrap but level 2 is useful. During fights you can cut oxygen and then crank it up to 2 between enemy barrages (sucking power from engines ).

It's whatever is the common practice at the time, which is constantly changing. Honestly, as long as people understand your meaning you can do whatever you want.  You don't want to abuse it (mixing up you're and your is just irritating), but it's particularly acceptable when you are compensating for a gap in the language, such as substituting ""they"" because there is no neutral gender, singular pronoun in English."
ftlgame,3aszc5,niceville,0,Tue Jun 23 20:30:40 2015 UTC,They can be plural or singular dependent on context. In that sentence you can just drop they in and it's a lovely gender neutral (and easier) way to talk about someone. Not everyone is a he or a she!

ftlgame,3aszc5,Omegatron9,4,Tue Jun 23 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"Almost more importantly, they don't have the power to use them. Should swap out the Vulcan for the second heavy laser to be able to power both and put two more bars into the engines."

ftlgame,3aszc5,Paradigmist,3,Tue Jun 23 20:27:18 2015 UTC,2x Flak + 2x Heavy Laser is better than using the Vulcan and uses less power.
ftlgame,3aszc5,itsamamaluigi,3,Tue Jun 23 14:57:03 2015 UTC,"Two heavy lasers would probably be amazing with two flaks, but if your ship can tank and dodge well then the vulcan might actually be better. Especially with 3 reloaders. I'd love to see how fast that can fire.  Weapon power caps at 8, so at most OP can only use the vulcan with two flaks anyway. I personally would use the flaks and the HL to take out the missile launcher and its manning crewmember ASAP, and then swap the HL for the vulcan."
ftlgame,3aszc5,BepisChristmas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, looking at OP's screenshot, he has no cloaking, no defense drone, and only 5 engines. But he does have a teleporter. So probably best to just board the missile room and kill it quickly so the flagship can't do too much damage. Maybe phase 1 is where he uses the Vulcan - hold off on doing too much damage while your boarding party is on board, instead giving the Vulcan time to spin up. They'll be done around the time the Vulcan is fully charged and then you can wreck it.  Combined with the fully upgraded artillery beam AND triple auto-reloaders, it probably doesn't even matter which weapon setup is used. The advantage of Flak/HL is you don't have to wait for it to deal full damage and it uses less power.  In phase 2 it shouldn't make much difference. For phase 3 I'd definitely use the Flak/HL setup to get the shield down as quickly as possible."
ftlgame,3aszc5,itsamamaluigi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"Indeed, any setup here is pretty great.  But for phase 3, I think vulcan might actually be better because of the zoltan shield - it means the fight will go on longer anyway.  I'm thinking about a vulcan-flak-hl-hl setup here. Damage output against supershield is still very good (vulcan still hits early - faster, but for less than another flak), and it packs more of a punch after it's broken."
ftlgame,3aszc5,mekloz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, looking at OP's screenshot, he has no cloaking, no defense drone, and only 5 engines.   Ah, my bad. I didn't even notice. Yeah, in that case taking out the missiles and other weapons with boarders would probably be the way to go. That or shooting the systems and then killing the crewmembers before they can repair it (probably the fastest option with this loadout and 3 reloaders, unless you get a BS amount of consecutive misses)."

ftlgame,3asum7,Hogwarts9876,24,Tue Jun 23 06:03:27 2015 UTC,"Stealth B has 36 blue choices, Engi C 36, Mantis C 36, Lanius B 35, Stealth A 34,  Federation A 19.  It's possible that I miss some events or that there is a ship higher.   Mantis C, Engi C and Lanius B get a nice amount of blue choices from crew (23, 19 and 19) but the surprise was from Stealth B. It only got 3 blue choices from crew but Sensors 2 give 17 blue choices! Along with Cloaking (7) and Long Range Scanner (8) it gets to the top tiers (the 36th blue choice come from the Beam weapon). Fed A is a good example that crew alone is not enough if you look for blue choices."
ftlgame,3asum7,Kuirem,12,Tue Jun 23 07:34:09 2015 UTC,"Sensors 2 give 17 blue choices   Actually, no. Of the 17 events with blue sensor option listed in the wiki, 4 of them: Engi Distress, Encrypted Fed Signal, Fed Ship Aid and Asteroid Belt distress count as one since the blue sensor option is contained within the Hidden Fed Base event that they may trigger. That brings the total number of actual blue sensor option down to 14. So the DA-SR 12 only has 33 blue options.  By the way, counting only the sheer number of blue option doesn't show how effective a ship is in providing you with blue option. For example, the Nessario and DA-SR 12 are both equipped with lv2 sensor and long range scanner, and a number of blue options they provide overlap with each other since they give you the exact same outcome in the same event."
ftlgame,3asum7,ChummyCommie,6,Tue Jun 23 09:05:53 2015 UTC,"Completely agree I didn't take into account the quality of blue events but it was a straight answer to the OP's question.  Some Blue options does overlap and other are actually worst options (Black Market Mind Control blue option) but I still counted them. Also while Slug and Lanius have the most Blue options, Engi options are overall better because you come accross them more often and they have better rewards."

ftlgame,3asum7,flak_1,4,Tue Jun 23 23:38:15 2015 UTC,"Are we talking about sheer number of blue options, or a more important but harder to pin down ""most free stuff from blue options""? The biggest difference I can see is that ships with Cloaking get a lot of blue options, but they're usually to avoid fights. Hacking is another one like that, where often its blue option is to counter enemy hacks, which might not even be the best choice (e.g. Countering oxygen hack when you could just use hacking to drop enemy shield and end fight sooner)  Most useful blue options is therefore likely to be Lanius B: Engi and Lanius blue options are almost always good (although Lanius crew ones are mostly in Abandoned sectors), and Teleporter and Mind Control offer some good ones too. Bonus points for Clone Bay for making a lot of non-blue options safer too, like firefighting on a station or fighting Giant Alien Spiders."
ftlgame,3asum7,51Gunner,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:14:33 2015 UTC,"Also, aren't there some some blue options that do nothing or even have negative results?"
ftlgame,3asum7,Dude579,3,Tue Jun 23 21:52:51 2015 UTC,With missile one option is useless. Also the black market blue choice is often considered worst because most of time it's better to attack rather than relying on a lucky weapon. You also have a lot of option in Nebula with Cloaking / Engine to run away from a fight (so no scrap reward)
ftlgame,3asum7,Kuirem,2,Wed Jun 24 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"You beat me to it. I can't say any of the blue options are purely bad, but a lot of the ones for engine/cloak merely let you avoid a fight. The opportunity cost stings a bit, but you're not strictly worse off for having done so.   I usually just attack the Black Market guy unless I could use a new weapon and have Mind Control - then I'll see what he's selling."
ftlgame,3asum7,51Gunner,-2,Wed Jun 24 20:47:50 2015 UTC,I think the engineer allows for the most blue options. Ship doesn't matter unless going for certain unlocks.

ftlgame,3auzmb,CandleStick97,4,Tue Jun 23 18:49:09 2015 UTC,"Your intro is a little long for a video of this style.  Posting into a forum dedicated to a game, It would be wise to either explain that you haven't played the game very much or play the game some more so that you have some experiences to talk about. Everyone here has beaten the game many times. If you are going to do a first reactions video, explaining that this video is one would help those people who stumble onto your video from leaving before you start playing. You took almost a fifth of the video before the game was even started and all of that was getting set up. You could have either shortened it by preparing first or use that time explaining your experiences. (which it sounds like you have none.)  So far, the only thing that you say in this video is explain everything that is on the screen or your basic observations. You need to make more videos so that you sound and become more comfortable talking during the video so that it becomes more natural. If you think the game is fun, make it sound like its fun. If you are having fun, its more enjoyable to sit and watch for the ~10 min. Remember, if you are doing a video, focus on the video. if you suck at the game but sound like you are having a fun time doing so is way better than doing well and sounding like you are bored. Maybe play games that are easier or games you are really good at so that the viewers can see you having fun and you can do good in the game.  For audio quality, its decent. It definitely wasn't painful to listen to but I could tell it wasn't the best. Hang up sheets on the walls (or foam but its more expensive) to reduce echos and be sure to use sound tools like compressor, normalize, equalize and noise removal to increase your voice quality. (look at tutorials of these tools in audacity which I assume you are doing)  p.s. No one likes an obvious youtube plug. Instead just say what you are doing in the video (Watch my first ftl run) would do a lot better than (I am new to youtube)  This is some things I learned on my channel during the last couple months of making video. Its hard but its like learning how to play the piano, its takes a lot of work and time, and its sounds terrible right away, but the more you learn how to not suck, the less you suck. I think you have a long way to go but if you keep it up I know you can make great content. You have a good start. I really like your outro by the way. Its simple and effective.  tl;dr: Sound more energetic/enthusiasic, get to the point a lot faster, and increase the audio quaility, and don't plug your channel, plug your content."

Jumping away from a fight is never ideal, but if a ship has dangerous weapons that you can't reliably take out then the scrap reward for winning probably won't cover the costs of the repairs you'll have to make.  This is especially true if the Rebel fleet catches you, because you always only get a small amount of fuel for winning (3-5 if you're totally out, 1 otherwise), and even if the Rebel ship can't get through your defenses you still have to worry about the anti-ship battery, which is impossible to delay or disable (though its shots can be dodged just like lasers and missiles can)."

ftlgame,3aqtu3,Dude579,4,Mon Jun 22 20:42:31 2015 UTC,"Well, cloak, 3 shield, good evade, defense drone and hacking does somewhat constitute ""turtling a bit"" so I guess that's how come it worked :P  The lack of bomb-fit ships, pulsars, and nearby suns I came across was GLORIOUS."
ftlgame,3aqtu3,slowriderxcorps,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:43:55 2015 UTC,"Part way into sector 3 I got an Ion bomb, then moved onto this chain ion sector 5, and upgraded the mini beam to a hull beam in sector 7.  Stage 1 and 2, no damage from the flagship, sat happily at full. As I could put the ion on the shield, my hacking went to their missiles giving me the ability to easily cloak/hack away every missile volley.  ...then they mind controlled me and that accursed zoltan shield held up longer than anticipated. Still a victory!"
ftlgame,3aoqro,fdagpigj,3,Mon Jun 22 07:03:02 2015 UTC,"Looks really interesting but I think it starts with a bit too much compared to most other ships.   Cloaking 1 and Piloting 1 are probably enough and also removes the Battery (you already start with Mind Control, a plus compared to other Stealth Ship).   Maybe add an extra starting power so you have 8 power for 9 things to power but you can also leave it to 7-9 to add some power management."
ftlgame,3aoqro,Kuirem,2,Mon Jun 22 07:13:42 2015 UTC,"I did also have a feeling that it has too strong a start, but I almost think it might have some disadvantages, like the linear layout that means if any system gets hacked, it most of the time splits the ship in two halves, and it's pretty cramped so beams might hit several crucial rooms more easily. One thing I could also do is make the charge laser use only one power as well and reduce total power by one. Not sure if that'd make it weaker, though, since both ways have their advantages. And, I do think further testing would be helpful, I didn't actually end up playtesting it much in practice."
ftlgame,3aoqro,Dude579,2,Mon Jun 22 07:52:36 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I saw ani's first 2 videos on this, looks like an interesting ship.   I hope you don't mind me adding my opinion. I feel like piloting, sensors and cloaking all at level two is too big. I feel like either cloaking or piloting should be level two with the others at level one. To compensate, there should be a slug instead of a human since they can see crew without seeing room and can get blue events to help out the ship succeed.   Anyway, my person opinion aside, well done on your first mode :)"
ftlgame,3aoqro,Dude579,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:28:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting point with the slug instead of level 2 sensors. I guess piloting could go down to level 1, but I wanted you to have some autopiloting so you could in dire situations send your pilot off to fight boarders. (In the first iterations of the ship I had piloting start at level 3, because I'd completely forgotten autopilot was buffed in AE from 25/50% to 50/80%...)."
ftlgame,3aoqro,Lunaria-Stalis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:41:26 2015 UTC,"Since the piloting upgrade to level 2 is only 20 scrap I feel like the cloaking should be level 2 since this ship is more weak to enemy weapons rather than boarders. Also mind control helps against borders too.  A strategy for dealing with boarders and a ship is to move the human (or slug) into the doors, start venting and move the engi to the doors too. Once the engi is there, move the pilot back. The only problem is if they board the piloting system."

If your medbay is operational then you can afford to put out the fire even if it nearly kills your crew. Fire weapons on enemy ship means they should have less other stuff, so it shouldn't be that difficult."
ftlgame,3an5gu,mekloz,3,Sun Jun 21 21:36:32 2015 UTC,"Just understand that Slug is actually one of the top 3 most difficult sectors to deal with. You should be prepared if you want to hit up slug, lanius, or rebel.  If you are not, you should try the alternative sectors, if possible."
ftlgame,3an5gu,Leylite,2,Mon Jun 22 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"Another tip: If a fire starts in an empty room, but you don't have the crew to spare to put it out, you can turn off your oxygen and let the fire consume the oxygen in that room until it puts itself out. You'll still need to keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn't spread to other, more important rooms (and that low-health crewmen don't walk through it).  Unfortunately, this event is bugged in that your doors don't return to normal after the ship is defeated. This is due to a typo in the XML files.

ftlgame,3an5gu,Dude579,2,Tue Jun 23 03:03:59 2015 UTC,I think if you have hacking you get a blue option to counter hack but I am not sure. Maybe someone else can confirm if I am right or not.
ftlgame,3an5gu,Leylite,5,Sun Jun 21 22:15:36 2015 UTC,"You do get a blue option, but if you have hacking already it's almost always better to just let them hack your doors, so you can hack the enemy ship and do damage to them."
ftlgame,3an5gu,Dude579,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:33:13 2015 UTC,Very true. I wonder if there are any other blie options for that event (such as level 3 doors (that would make sense in my head))
ftlgame,3an5gu,51Gunner,2,Sun Jun 21 22:42:48 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, there are no other blue options for that event. It's probably best just to hack weapons or shields, then shoot the hell out of their weapons systems so they can't burninate you."
ftlgame,3an0nc,liquidmetalrob,8,Sun Jun 21 20:44:56 2015 UTC,"For what is the question. Once you can get through shields, it's heavy all the way - very few weapons in the game are better at decimating a single system. Before that, hull gives you more shots. It's slow, though, so if I get both of them by chance, I'll probably try harder to make heavy work in my weapon set up."
ftlgame,3an0nc,mekloz,6,Sun Jun 21 21:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say Heavy is best for most ""normal"" ships, while Hull is stronger at the flagship. Hitting with a heavy laser 2 does so strong damage to a system that it's basically out for the fight (or severly weakened) with all the fire and breaches going on from it, the enemy probably won't even get to repair. The flagship fight is more of a damage race though, deactivating a few systems is nice and all, but a hull laser can deal tons of hull damage quickly, ending the fight much sooner. Especially phase 2 and 3 can't be tanked for too long (unless you get some really defensive stuff), so you are better off destroying the flagship asap."
ftlgame,3an0nc,Eirh,5,Mon Jun 22 04:40:22 2015 UTC,"Do you already have something to pierce shield? (Ion Blast 2, Flak..)  If you do, pick Heavy Laser II, more systems damage, faster cooldown, cheaper and a chance to stun enemy crew.  If you don't, pick Hull Laser II, 1 extra shoot to pierce shield and start fire/breach. Also you can deal 6 damage to quickly take down a Ship."
ftlgame,3an0nc,Kuirem,3,Sun Jun 21 21:40:08 2015 UTC,"I prefer the Heavy Laser 2 at 13 seconds charge time compared to the Hull Laser 2's 15 second charge time. It meshes better with other cooldown times like the BL2's 12 seconds, or Flak 1's 10 seconds. The difference between the Heavy and the Hull's recharge time can be the difference between the enemy's Pike beams or other similar weapons getting to fire.   Also, I find the secondary effects of the Heavy better. Both have that sweet 30% breach chance, but the Heavy enjoys 30% chance of fire over the Hull's 10%, and throw in a 20% chance of a stun as well. The real joy is in combinations too - Stunning enemies that try to put out the fires is a good time."
ftlgame,3an0nc,51Gunner,2,Mon Jun 22 02:17:30 2015 UTC,"Hull Laser II. It does just as much systems damage (2) through one shield bubble that you couldn't take down with your other weapons (I think more on average if the opponent has nonzero evasion?), more damage through two shields (1 rather than 0), more hull damage through any number of shields (6 rather than 4), and its only downside is that if you take down all the enemy shields with the other weapons, it does 3 systems damage rather than 4. (Not sure if it has a better breach chance, but it might well do, in which case it's probably better for targeting systems despite the lower damage.)  This is all assuming that I'm remembering correctly in that they both use 3 power. I guess the way to look at it is that a Hull Laser II is a Burst Laser II variant, whereas a Heavy Laser II is a Burst Laser I variant. And I think we all know which of the burst lasers is the best."
ftlgame,3an0nc,ais523,3,Sun Jun 21 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"Both take 3 power. Heavy laser II has a 30% chance for fire and breach, 20% chance for stun. Hull laser is 10% chance fire,  30% breach."
ftlgame,3an0nc,superfantastic1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:38:22 2015 UTC,Generally I would say hull laser is best (atleadt for my play style) but if have something to take down shields then the heavy laser is more useful.

ftlgame,3akeh7,Leylite,4,Sun Jun 21 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"Not really immune, but it helps a ton with things like Burst Laser III, or combat drones especially. I'll often buy one Shield Charge Booster in sector 7 if I see it (and I don't have cloaking) just because of how helpful it can be against the Flagship's drone surge. Shield Charge Boosters even continue working when you lose the shield manning bonus (like if there's a boarding drone or fire in there, or the system is damaged)."

In addition, the diverse crew lets you get a few blue events and deal with most threats early on"
ftlgame,3aj7gv,vvf,2,Sat Jun 20 20:39:35 2015 UTC,The Red Tail is ridiculous. I beat Hard with it quite soundly. By the end I had 4 Flak II's equipped. Flagship got shredded in seconds.
ftlgame,3aj7gv,Hogwarts9876,4,Sat Jun 20 22:53:07 2015 UTC,4 Flak II's equipped   Hardly the Red-Tail's fault though...
ftlgame,3aj7gv,vvf,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:54:38 2015 UTC,"It was quite a lucky run, but that luck was facilitated by the OP weapon configuration. I didn't have to upgrade weapons til sector 4. It was probably the easiest playthrough I've done on any difficulty."
ftlgame,3aj7gv,51Gunner,2,Sun Jun 21 06:04:15 2015 UTC,"I like the Red Tail, but I find it's roughly equal with the Kestral A - the  4x Basic Laser loadout is nice on the Red-Tail, but I like the Burst Laser 2's lasting value."
ftlgame,3aj7gv,zandinavian,5,Tue Jun 23 03:11:51 2015 UTC,"The three ships that give me an (almost) guaranteed win on normal is the Engi A, Federation A, and the Stealth A. I'm sure there's other even more overpowered ships, but I'm pretty damn consistent with these three.   Fed A is my favorite, so I'll go into detail on it.   For the Fed A, just focus on defense. Your artillery beam + Burst II will carry you for the first 2 sectors. Get your second shield level ASAP, and then try to get a defense drone/cloaking/both whenever the opportunity arises. Upgrade your engines when you can- don't forget about them. At the very least, get one engine upgrade per sector. I don't run a teleporter on the Fed A, but if you decide to, turn off your artillery beam. You will forget it's turned on, and you will lose your boarders when it cleaves the ship in half. Also, Auto-Reloader augments actually affect the artillery beam (-10% charge speed). You can also stack them and get 3 if you had the opportunity to.  When you feel very safe and secure (not taking damage every jump, 3 shields in sector 2/3, etc), start upgrading your artillery beam. The first level is cheap, but it gets incredibly costly in the later upgrades. In the end game, consider buying a battery charger if you're ahead on scrap (and you have maxed out or planned to max out your energy capacity). This is because the artillery beam will be eating up power supply that would normally be sitting around for other ships. When you're powering cloaking, drones, lots of engine power, and four shields, you will be running out of power even at the max level. The battery and zoltans helps mitigate this.   In the midgame, try to hold on to 100-ish scrap at all times in case you run into a store with an insta-buy like a burst-II, Flak-I, etc. You'll hate yourself if you spend all of your scrap on doors, only to see a store in the next jump. Feel free to blow any scrap above the 100 mark though on upgrades.  Lastly, long range scanners is the best augment in the game. Buy it when you see it. It's dirt cheap, and it will earn you an incredible amount of scrap in the long run because you will be able to fight many more ships, and you can now avoid run-ending pulsars and sketchy ion storms."
ftlgame,3aj7gv,jonobonbon,3,Sat Jun 20 19:12:36 2015 UTC,"Just keep experimenting. That's what I did. I've beat it with Federation A and B, and Engi A so far. It all comes down to what style of play you are comfortable with."
ftlgame,3aj7gv,Eirh,2,Sat Jun 20 20:31:13 2015 UTC,If you have them Crystal B (once you understand the basics of crystal boarding) or Lanius B are really strong ships. I got my first normal win with Crystal B I think (to be fair I got that ship extremely early) but AE wasn't really a thing back then.  Kestrel B is a great idea too though.
ftlgame,3aj7gv,datssyck,2,Sun Jun 21 00:28:06 2015 UTC,"Fed A IMO. It got me my first easy win, first normal win, and so far my only hard win."
ftlgame,3aj7gv,BepisChristmas,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:17:57 2015 UTC,"As others have already mentioned, Kestrel B is probably the best gunship available because of its starting weapons. You'll have no problems getting through the first few sectors, and with some luck you'll find even better weapons along the way.  Fed A and B are both good because the Artillery Beam is very powerful. It's guaranteed damage ignoring both shields AND evasion, so you can play defensively and never have to worry about stalemates. The biggest downside is that you only have two system slots. Also, while the Artillery Beam is a guaranteed damage-dealer, it targets randomly and does only 1 damage per room, making it basically useless for disabling systems strategically. Hacking, bombs, mind control, and boarding can all help with that; but be mindful of your beam's cooldown and the enemy ship's hull if you have boarders on board and no clone bay.  Engi C is a very underrated ship imo. It starts with hacking (which is always nice) and a defense scrambler (which can benefit you all the way up to the Flagship's second phase). You can have a lot of fun with this ship if you're lucky enough to find a drone recovery arm.  Finally, almost all of the ships that start with boarding are quite good, especially Lanius B and Crystal B. Boarding alone can't directly take the flagship out, but winning battles with enemy ships intact significantly increases the scrap you will gain over the course of a run. It also means more free weapons, more crew members, and a reduced chance of the dreaded ""out of fuel"" scenario."
ftlgame,3aj7gv,51Gunner,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say the Lanius B if you have it - it's got a great boarding team in 2x Lanius (plus a clone bay to replace them), and a Mind Control system to augment your boarders. On top of all this, it's got the most power-efficient gun in the game. The Advanced Flak fires 3 shots for 1 power, and charges faster than a regular Flak 1.   TL;DR version: Amazing boarding ship, but comes with a gun! A good gun, even!"

ftlgame,3adhsv,Kuirem,25,Sat Jun 20 00:53:41 2015 UTC,Great comic. Still... this makes me wonder:   When we upgrade our reactor are we throwing... dead Zoltans in it? (Happy Nightmare Fuel!)  Might be better not to think about it.
ftlgame,3adhsv,ChemicalRascal,27,Fri Jun 19 07:10:04 2015 UTC,"Only for the Flagship.  It's got an emergency reactor for emergency FTL warps, powered by Zoltan in hamster wheels.  (besides, i imagine dead zoltan just lose power and grow cold if they don't explode in the first place.)"
ftlgame,3adhsv,ChummyCommie,6,Fri Jun 19 07:47:49 2015 UTC,"Since they explode when they die, it is likely they are comatose. It is likely they didn't go naturally into that coma."
ftlgame,3adhsv,Kuirem,14,Fri Jun 19 12:54:55 2015 UTC,So that's what they call power lifting?
ftlgame,3adhsv,ChummyCommie,5,Fri Jun 19 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"Pfft, Zoltan are lightweights."
ftlgame,3adhsv,Kuirem,3,Sat Jun 20 00:10:52 2015 UTC,"But but but mass-energy equivalence! E=mc2 , man!"
ftlgame,3adhsv,cowens,7,Sat Jun 20 01:06:57 2015 UTC,Don't science at me. Have you tried putting pure energy on a scale? How much did it weigh? Hn? Hn?

ftlgame,3adhsv,justintnelson,9,Sat Jun 20 05:08:45 2015 UTC,I wonder how much a Zoltan weight. Zoltan are roughly the same corpulence of a human but their body is able to produce enough energy to power a system.   Is it really possible to lift him/her like that?
ftlgame,3adhsv,Omegatron9,12,Fri Jun 19 07:09:00 2015 UTC,Pure energy. They have almost zero weight.
ftlgame,3adhsv,HadrasVorshoth,10,Fri Jun 19 09:08:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm I don't know, I doubt they are pure energy. They can press button on a terminal and punch people so they must be partially material.  Since a system most likely use the energy it means that a Zoltan is constantly producing it and that's this energy core that must weight a lot. The mass of the energy is negligible of course (E = mc²)."

ftlgame,3adhsv,Anistuffs,3,Sat Jun 20 00:50:33 2015 UTC,"Whatever a Zoltan use to produce energy, it has to be extremely efficient, up to 90% or more, since they produce way more energy than they actually need.    Let's assume that one bar of power is equivalent to the total energy consumption of the ISS, which is about 100 kilowatts or 3600 kilowatt hours. So in one hour, one bar of power would generate 3600 kilowatt hour of energy, or 12,960 megajoules. Convert that to weight, we can see that a Zoltan would be losing 144 micrograms per hour. Now, since we don't know the average lifespan of a Zoltan, it's impossible to calculate their mass. But let's just assume that they can live up to 100 years, or 876,600 hours, then your average Zoltan weigh in at about 126,230,400 micrograms, or 0.1262304 kilogram. Now tell me, how much weight can the average human lift?"
ftlgame,3adhsv,woostermcgee,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:07:54 2015 UTC,"This is a naïve interpretation of what a Zoltan does.  It is very possible that the ""energy"" produced in systems by a Zoltan has nothing to do with energy generation.  For instance, a Zoltan may reduce the resistance of metal near them.  This would result in less energy being lost in transmission."
ftlgame,3adhsv,HELPMEIMGONADIE,0,Sun Jun 21 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm that could also explain why you don't have a reactor room. The generator is super efficient and so small it doesn't need its own room.  I thought that the energy would not weight much it's more the weight of the generator that may be important. But we can only guess on that. If they have something so efficient to produce power, why the battery is so weak? It takes a whole system room but is only capable of producing 2/4 bar during a short time. Once again it may use an other process that is more reliable but less efficient (after all Zoltan Pop easily)  That's all guess but I like to think that the frail Zoltan are super heavy due to their energy core."

ftlgame,3acwtl,PigAteMyPie,8,Fri Jun 19 02:18:33 2015 UTC,"Rock C supposedly takes a lot of the RNG out of the quest because you start with a crystalman and therefore just need to find the Rock homeworlds and the appropriate quest beacon within it. Some people say it's not even necessary to rename him, but I wouldn't know. Also, you can only find the Rock homeworlds after a certain point. I believe it has to be sector 5 or later, so if you make it to the end of sector 1 and see that no hostile sectors are past the fourth sector, then you can start over. Otherwise, take the path that gives you the most chances to hit hostile sectors after sector 4.  Personally, I think it's easier to just beat the game with all the other ships just because it's easier to build a ship up into something that can take out the flagship than it is to have everything fall into place for the unlock quest. For all of my successful runs I've only gotten Ruwen like 2 or 3 times, and not once seen the Crystal sector."
ftlgame,3acwtl,BepisChristmas,10,Fri Jun 19 03:37:42 2015 UTC,"It is necessary to rename him in order for the quest to show up in the Rock Homeworlds.

I only discovered this by accident (I forgot to rename him before I went to the Rock Homeworlds) and found the beacon by chance."
ftlgame,3acwtl,Gildedjandle,3,Fri Jun 19 04:11:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, good to know. I would not suspect that it worked that way."
ftlgame,3acwtl,BepisChristmas,2,Fri Jun 19 15:35:32 2015 UTC,Can you rename him in the Rock Homeworld then the quest shows up or do you need to do it before that sector?
ftlgame,3acwtl,Dude579,6,Fri Jun 19 16:05:20 2015 UTC,It needs to be done before you enter the homeworlds - the quest marker is added when you enter the sector with a Crystal named Ruwen.
ftlgame,3acwtl,51Gunner,2,Fri Jun 19 18:19:03 2015 UTC,You need to do it before
ftlgame,3acwtl,Gildedjandle,5,Fri Jun 19 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"If you get lucky, it's easier to do the quest. But, if you don't want to hope to get very lucky, it's probably quicker to defeat the flagship with everything else."
ftlgame,3acwtl,GoodIdea321,4,Fri Jun 19 03:02:10 2015 UTC,"Depends. The Crystal quest is heavily luck dependent while the alternative requires both luck and skill. The best option is to do both: try to beat the game with every A and B layouts. If you're lucky, then you will get the Crystal quest in the course of doing so. If not, then you will unlock the ship eventually."
ftlgame,3acwtl,ChummyCommie,5,Fri Jun 19 03:16:22 2015 UTC,"Short answer: I think it's easier to win with all ships, but you could get lucky earlier.   Checking my stats, I've played 215 games to 59 victories. I also know I've been to the Hidden Crystal Sector exactly twice, so this gives us a loose number of 1% of runs where you'll succeed. This could be cautiously bumped up to 2% if you discount early re-rolls (Stealth B against mini-beam and beam drone kind of run), and the runs undertaken before I knew what to do to unlock the ship. Call it ""between one and two percent chance"".  Using those numbers again, let's estimate a roughly 25% chance of winning a given run. The percentage could go up from playing only on Easy while working toward the ship, but also needs to be adjusted for the fact that you're forced to use some of the bad ships until you win with them - those stats are padded a bit by avoiding playing as the Slug B or Engi B more than a couple times. With 16 ships to complete with, and a 25% chance of succeeding, we'll say this requires 64 runs.   The real deciding factor is that some of those ships are probably already complete on your profile, while ""the dice have no memory"" for your luck on reaching the Crystal sector. I'd be interested in seeing how other people's experiences compare though."
ftlgame,3acwtl,51Gunner,2,Fri Jun 19 18:36:00 2015 UTC,"Very good answer.  The only thing I would add is: Which is more fun for you, to grind on a single ship for a single goal grind on multiple ships to beat the game?  Looking back, when I was playing Normal consistently (which would be your average player) I probably won about 50% of the time on Easy.  This would be +90% with the strong ships and ~20% of the time with the weak/weird ships.  So I would probably estimate 32 runs, with each run at ~1.5 hr, gives ~50 hours.  I followed this guide to grind for the quest.  I had about 500 restarts, with most last ~5 seconds (buying LRS on your first jump).  About 25 made it to the end of sector one (checking the route for the correct sectors).  My 6th run to sector 7 netted me the Rock Homeworlds and the quest.  Overall, it took ~6 hours, but I'm not sure how ""fun"" it would be for most people.  Personally, I am very OCD and enjoy completing a game, so it was pretty fun, though a bit tedious.  Since then, I've only hit the Crystal Homeworlds once, though I have reached the correct beacon sans Crystal Crew about five times, so I would agree with the 1-2% chance.  Pick your poison: 50-60 hours of ""normal"" play or 5-6 hours of ""tedious grinding"" play."
ftlgame,3acwtl,n_slash_a,2,Wed Jun 24 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"I used this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=170464357  and it was pretty easy. If you get layout A and B of rock, then getting layout C is easy, and once you have layout C, you can do it like others have said."
ftlgame,3acwtl,TopRamen713,3,Fri Jun 19 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Getting Rock B is kind of a nuisance though. Rock A is on my list of ships that aren't a lot of fun to play, and the achievements for it are irritating. Killing a ship that has a defense drone with missiles alone is obnoxious, as finding ships with defense drones early on is luck-based.  The boarding achievement is annoying as hell too, although Hacking  to lock doors helps a TON. Otherwise the enemy likes to run away."
ftlgame,3acwtl,51Gunner,2,Sat Jun 20 03:44:06 2015 UTC,IMO: Quest unlock with Rock C > Winning with every A/B Layout > regular Quest unlock.
ftlgame,3acwtl,NeJin,2,Fri Jun 19 21:39:27 2015 UTC,Mathematician's answer: Yes ;)  Actual useful answer: I'd say the latter. My luck with even the rock homeworlds appearing at all is abysmal at best.

ftlgame,3aai0b,chewbacca77,12,Thu Jun 18 15:00:48 2015 UTC,"Remember, you can toggle your shields off, let the enemy ion blast pass, and turn them back on.  The first volley from that ship would have been a little tough to time, but definitely possible."
ftlgame,3aai0b,Leylite,2,Thu Jun 18 15:20:39 2015 UTC,"The thing about the heavy ion is that it applies 10 seconds worth of ionization, so you do get two chances to land your heavy laser... that's cold comfort when it's the heavy ion itself that misses, though."
ftlgame,3aai0b,itsamamaluigi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah... Engi B would be superior even if all you did was replace the heavy ion with an ion blast 1. A supposedly ""worse"" weapon that does 1 ion damage instead of 2... but it fires every 8 seconds and still takes down 1 shield layer. Less waiting if your ion misses.."
ftlgame,3aai0b,Cloudy_Customer,2,Thu Jun 18 20:27:03 2015 UTC,I recommend to upgrade the weapon system as soon as possible. That gives you the damage buffer to survive the first volley and gives you the chance to take down the enemy's weapons.
ftlgame,3aai0b,n_slash_a,2,Thu Jun 18 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"Shields first, weapons second.  Two shield bubbles would make you invincible in this situation.  Not that it matters too much, since this looked like the first few jumps, based on the score."

Many enemy ships lack basic functions like a medbay or useful weapons, especially early in the game. And a lot of them are so small that there is no room to add systems.

ftlgame,3a8bxj,tue2day,3,Fri Jun 19 05:17:59 2015 UTC,"It's to prevent a deadly downward spiral of damage and repairs.  Shields are great for protecting against beams and lasers. But they do absolutely nothing against missiles and bombs. The only way to avoid those is to dodge them or shoot them down with a defense drone.  Defense drones are great but it's a hefty investment, requiring you to purchase the Drone Control system, a defense drone if it didn't come with one, and you must supply a steady stream of drone parts (usually not a problem if you're not also using hacking or other drones all the time).  Cloaking is a great way to avoid missiles but it's also a big investment and you can only dodge about half of the missiles due to the long cooldown.  And neither defense drones nor cloaking is usually available early in the game. Upgrading your engines will help you take less damage cumulatively over the course of your game, resulting in fewer repairs and less scrap wasted on repairs. An errant missile can always hit your weapons or shields as well, leading to a much quicker downward spiral.  The side benefit of upgraded engines is your FTL charges quicker. If you come across a killer enemy and have to run, good luck doing that with level 1-2 engines. If you reach level 6 engines, you can jump away from the Rebel fleet and their ASBs before they hit you. This allows you to explore past the exit beacon, usually by 2-3 jumps. Especially in later sectors, this can give you an extra 100-150 scrap per sector or let you hit that last store before the last stand.  Upgrading engines isn't expensive and has many benefits."
ftlgame,3a8bxj,itsamamaluigi,3,Fri Jun 19 15:01:43 2015 UTC,"Repost of mine from an old thread:  Engines do the following things:   Missiles. Missiles will fuck you up. They're the real killer in the game. Engines provide defense against missiles, shields do nothing. Lasers. Engines also help against lasers, because dodging shots is just as good as blocking them with the shield. It's random and not dependable, but will prevent damage in the long run. Ions. To survive against stacking ions you need to have a chain of not getting hit. Dodge does that. Shields does not. 100% dodge with cloaking. If you want dodge to be dependable, you need 100% dodge, which is 4 engines with cloaking and leveled crew. It's invaluable against the big scary Breach Missiles. Smooth out your scrap curve. If you take less damage, you spend less on repairs. That means you want to upgrade your ship as early as possible. Sinking everything into shields becomes too expensive between upgrades. Engines lets you smooth out the curve. Better ""dump"" stat for power. You can move power in and out of engines to immediately get the benefit. It's a great system to move power between oxygen / drones / etc. if you are lacking power. Running from fights. Ever die from bad fires at a sun? Ever die from an ion pulse that went on for just too long? How about that one OP ship that came out of nowhere? Or when you get caught by rebels and the ASB is pounding your ship? Sometimes the right decision is to run, and engines help with that.   Many good players suggest upgrading engines and shields at about the same rate: e.g. if you have 4 bars of shields, you should have about 4 bars of engines. There's a reason for that. It's important.  Another thing they'll do is increase the rate at which your crew levels.  Two-star piloting and engines adds +10% dodge, which is very helpful.  Getting that early means less damage taken."

ftlgame,3a8bxj,SmartAlec105,2,Thu Jun 18 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, you chose very well with your weapons. To reiterate everyone else, though, you need to put more into your engines. Give it about the same priority as you would shields. Piloting and doors are also very important. An upgraded oxygen system is nice to have as a system damage buffer and because it can allow you to fix breaches without hurting your crew, but it's not as essential as you might think. It takes quite a while for a broken oxygen system alone to drain your ship from 100% to 0%; much more time than it would take to fix it, even with a lone Mantis."
ftlgame,3a8bxj,BepisChristmas,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:24:09 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the only reason he got as far as he did was because he had such amazing weapons.  Upgrading oxygen is really good for facing stage 1 of the flagship in case it hacks your O2.

That's obviously a manufacturing defect and not an animation error, though. :)  I admit this episode had me on the edge of my seat during the space battles - so far this crew has been very lucky that missiles haven't ever caused fires or hull breaches.  I think Jose also brings up an interesting point that we in the subreddit tend to gloss over, when he distrusts the medbay - we've made a habit of just healing up our crew after every little scratch, but he does seem a bit distrustful of putting medical nanomachines inside his body. Well, I guess that's an element of the setting that's open to interpretation, like many other elements."
ftlgame,3a38mj,Leylite,2,Tue Jun 16 22:17:05 2015 UTC,That's obviously a manufacturing defect    That news report at the beginning was talking about how the federation's currency was failing. They probably couldn't afford to to pay someone to spellcheck.

ftlgame,3a471i,BepisChristmas,5,Wed Jun 17 03:40:54 2015 UTC,If he hadn't spent the scrap on the switch to clonebay he could have upgraded doors. Among other things.
ftlgame,3a471i,Lunaria-Stalis,3,Wed Jun 17 15:07:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I tend to prioritize upgrading doors over extra systems since boarders can happen at any sector. I'm just saying that that's what I think happened here, because those boarder events tend to be common in nebulas."

ftlgame,3a47fa,superhareball,4,Wed Jun 17 02:33:27 2015 UTC,Think of it this way: You died but didnt fail. The flagship fell and the federation triumphed a few minutes after your death

ftlgame,3a47fa,BepisChristmas,2,Wed Jun 17 09:03:44 2015 UTC,"Ouch.  If I can make a suggestion, I think cloaking would have helped you immensely here (I mean, it's pretty much always good to have, but especially here). You've got two CL2s which means up to 8 shots at once, which is pretty good. The problem is it takes 20 seconds to charge them up all the way, which is a very long time. Cloaking would guarantee dodging the really dangerous stuff like missiles and power surges and missiles synched with power surges, while also essentially giving you free time to charge those lasers up. Also, upgraded hacking is extremely useful. When combined with cloaking it can make slower-charging weapons totally incapable of hurting you."
ftlgame,3a47fa,BepisChristmas,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I love cloaking, but it is expensive, and I think on this Lanius ship, you only get room for one extra module. I generally only use hacking as a counter to enemy hacking, might need to rethink this..."
ftlgame,3a47fa,Fergusmo88,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:29:53 2015 UTC,"True. Cloaking is the most expensive thing you can buy unless I'm forgetting something. It's most useful with slow, strong weapons. Don't underestimate the usefulness of maxed-out or near-maxed-out engines, either. It's surprisingly easy to take little to no damage from the laser power surge with more than 50% evasion and four (or even three!) shields.  As for countering hacking, all types of defense drones (including anti-combat drones) can shoot hacking drones. They fly fast, though, and in my experience the chances of the flagship actually running out of drones before it can get one past defense drones is quite low. If something vital gets hacked like shields or piloting, you can try jumping away and back as long as the flagship hasn't been at the base for too long. If you're lucky they'll hack something less important the second time."
ftlgame,3a47fa,Fergusmo88,0,Thu Jun 18 04:30:34 2015 UTC,Why do you even need hacking to counter enemy hacking? Unless they hack weapons and you have like a glaive beam it should be relatively harmless. Hack shields instead.
ftlgame,3a53zc,Dude579,2,Wed Jun 17 08:21:39 2015 UTC,Really good offer. Will work great in combination with your ion stunner. Want some tips on improving your runs?

ftlgame,3a3l7b,Hithercat,9,Tue Jun 16 23:25:08 2015 UTC,"They have a niche use as a boarding support weapon. Beyond that, they won't do much."
ftlgame,3a3l7b,bughumbar,9,Tue Jun 16 23:33:16 2015 UTC,"You can use it to lock enemies in burning rooms, but again, niche use."
ftlgame,3a3l7b,apemanzilla,3,Tue Jun 16 23:45:25 2015 UTC,Might be a fun combo on Rock B with the fire bomb.
ftlgame,3a3l7b,51Gunner,7,Tue Jun 16 23:52:18 2015 UTC,"While it'd be kinda useful to start nasty fires and then prevent the enemy from getting to them, this will chew through your supplies of bombs like nobody's business and leave you with only 1-2 weapon slots left to kill anything."
ftlgame,3a3l7b,itsamamaluigi,4,Wed Jun 17 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"For boarding support, it's mediocre but not completely useless as it can trap enemies inside a room with you, preventing them from escaping to the medbay. If they have a clone bay, you can lock it down and then teleport your guys in to destroy it without anyone to stop you.  The problem is it charges very slowly and is only useful for boarding support - small bomb, on the other hand, is useful for boarding support but also for damaging important systems and charges faster on top of that.  The Mantis C starts with a lockdown bomb and the first thing I do when I reach a store is sell it."
ftlgame,3a3l7b,MrNoS,3,Wed Jun 17 19:38:02 2015 UTC,Not really.  They use a bomb to lock enemies in a room.  They do no hull or system damage and take a while to charge.
ftlgame,3a3l7b,n_slash_a,2,Wed Jun 17 00:50:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love the Lockdown Bomb.  It is, as other people have said, purely for boarding support.  It is exactly like the Crystal lockdown ability, great for locking enemy crew in/out of a specific room."
ftlgame,3a3l7b,Leylite,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:22:44 2015 UTC,"They might occasionally be worth using in the early game to prevent crew from repairing systems, or to lock repair drones in the drone room, but later on you need much more direct offenses to deal with enemy weapons, and often can't keep a niche utility weapon in one of your weapon slots.  This also applies to the stun bomb and repair blast."
ftlgame,3a3l7b,51Gunner,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"I've found that the repair bomb can be kinda handy alongside something like a Vulcan that doesn't need any help killing stuff.

ftlgame,3a167o,willowgardener,5,Tue Jun 16 23:08:50 2015 UTC,"teleport. This gives you an extra fancy option: use hacking, mind control, AND teleport on the weapons system. Your hack makes it hard for them to get defenders into the missile room. If you mind control the guy in the enemy's weapons room and then teleport your mantis in there, that gives you the effective attack strength of FOUR crew (mantis count for 1.5 each) on their undefended weapons system, plus whatever bonus the upgraded mind control gives you. If you haven't completely crippled the weapons system by the time they get a defender in there, you can just activate your hacking. It's pretty unlikely that you're going to get hit much after that purchase."
ftlgame,3a167o,justintnelson,4,Tue Jun 16 17:10:52 2015 UTC,"Nitpick: When destroying systems, all races have the same attack strength.  Absolutely agree with the strategy though."
ftlgame,3a167o,willowgardener,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:28:04 2015 UTC,Oh! Good to know--I'd never realized that. Does the +20% bonus from from expertise affect damage to systems? And does the bonus from level 2-3 mind control?
ftlgame,3a167o,justintnelson,2,Tue Jun 16 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm pretty sure those only affect crew-to-crew damage. As far as I know, nothing affects the speed at which crew damages systems, other than how many of them are on it. But they still get fight exp from doing so."
ftlgame,3a167o,willowgardener,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:58:53 2015 UTC,Good to know!
ftlgame,3a167o,DoctorSauce,0,Wed Jun 17 01:40:23 2015 UTC,"Somehow I really doubt this. I'm sure that when I've been boarded by Mantises, they damage my systems much faster than other races. I'll admit I don't have proof though."
ftlgame,3a167o,justintnelson,2,Wed Jun 17 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"When I board auto-scouts, I keep a close eye on my guys' health. They lose ~90 hp in the time it takes to destroy two system bars (or one, with only one boarder), whether they're Mantis or Human or Engi.  Enemy Mantis boarders move faster, and your crew can't hold them off for as long as other races. So they do end up destroying your systems sooner, even if they're not doing it faster per se."
ftlgame,3a167o,DAPARROT,3,Wed Jun 17 09:49:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely teleporter,you have mantises,and if missiles are a problem,just hack the weapons."
ftlgame,3a167o,superfantastic1,2,Tue Jun 16 14:07:48 2015 UTC,"If this was hard mode i would say drone control, otherwise its up to you. Both systems will pay for themselves. Teleporter will net you more scrap for crew kills. Defense drone will save you money on repairs."
ftlgame,3a167o,ChummyCommie,2,Tue Jun 16 16:40:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't get drone control if I have hacking.

ftlgame,39ybsq,ajthecreator,17,Mon Jun 15 20:03:18 2015 UTC,I always feel like the reactor is way on the inside of a ship (the way a huge giant spaceship reactor should be) and the hull points are a measure of how much damage the ship can take before the reactor's hull plating is compromised (and the ship subsequently explodes).
ftlgame,39ybsq,Leylite,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:15:33 2015 UTC,"Surely there is a reactor control room, as you do control where reactor power goes. Similar to how you disable weapons by disabling the weapons control room"
ftlgame,39ybsq,ModernShoe,16,Tue Jun 16 06:19:47 2015 UTC,"This was originally going to be in the game, but it was removed as the devs thought it removed the strategy from targeting systems. Their words, not mine."
ftlgame,39ybsq,Paradigmist,2,Tue Jun 16 02:13:29 2015 UTC,"Makes a lot of sense. If you can target shields then reactor, you take out everything rather than individual systems."

ftlgame,39ybsq,reddevved,29,Tue Jun 16 08:55:46 2015 UTC,There would never be any point in targeting systems. You just target that and all their systems are offline
ftlgame,39ybsq,FlyingRep,12,Mon Jun 15 20:50:57 2015 UTC,"eh, not really. It would make them prioritize their systems. It would require a re-write of the AI, but could be interesting. Same as a neb zone that saps your reactor, you have to decide what to keep powered.  If you want to sap my reactors, I can take O2 offline for a while, take med/clone down, shuffle zoltans around, etc and still keep shields/offence up. In the meantime, had you targeted a single system, you might have disabled it."
ftlgame,39ybsq,salacious_c,14,Mon Jun 15 21:56:06 2015 UTC,"and also it would take, like 15, or 20 damage to completely disable the reactor, and by that time you would have destroyed the ship."
ftlgame,39ybsq,51Gunner,8,Mon Jun 15 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily: fire, boarders, or bombs could all take that reactor offline for a good long time.

ftlgame,39ybsq,Lunaria-Stalis,7,Mon Jun 15 20:14:51 2015 UTC,Ions would be cool too. Ionizing the system would take away two power if you think about it.

ftlgame,39ybsq,sk_2013,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:54:04 2015 UTC,"Let's take a basic ship with 8 power (2 Weapons, 2 Shields, 2 Engine, 1 Oxygen, 1 Medbay). If you have a double Ion blast I you can only take down shield. Now if you hit the reactor (let's say you have a laser to take down the shield) in 4 salves you have disabled all of their systems instead of just the shield.  In quick fight it might not be worth it but against tougher enemy I can see it as a valid strategy. Of course it will be even stronger in Plasma Storm or with a Ion Bomb (-8 Power yeahh)."
ftlgame,39ybsq,ais523,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:27:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that sounds broken as hell.  Part of the balance of ion bombs is that you can only hit one system per bomb. This would allow you to knock out multiple subsystems, and you wouldn't have to worry about damage overflow."

ftlgame,39z5pv,Immortails,18,Mon Jun 15 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"SHOOT THE FUCK OUT OF EVERYTHING  You're set for the first few sectors on weapons. Go for shields and engines, and if you pick up any other weapons on the way, that's great. Just don't go actually buying any.  First and foremost, the Red-Tail is a gunship, where you carefully use crafted tactics requiring expert level of finesse shoot the fuck out of everything. Now, it doesn't have to be a gunship, and you can change your playstyle however you want, just like any other ship. But that costs scrap, and if you're struggling at the game, you need all the scrap you can get.  Lasers are really really really good at breaking shields, and the two things that go well with that are beams and more lasers. I'll focus on those.  If you find a Halberd, Pike or Fire Beam, keep those. Glaive works but it's a little iffy if the other guy has missiles, so you will take hits. Depending on if you have a pre-igniter or cloaking or your defense is ridiculously good, Glaive may not be the best choice for you. But yeah, all beams go well with the lasers.  As for lasers, whatever you want works except for maybe the Burst Laser I. That only gives one more laser. A Vulcan can also work because you will have more lasers to dish out damage in the meantime - but DON'T pair Vulcans and beams. They both take relatively long to charge and then you only have two basic lasers to pierce two shields which is really not a lot. Plus, if you miss one, you have to wait another ten seconds to fire another round.  This is not to say that other weapons don't work on Red-Tail; like I said before, you can do whatever you want on it just like other ships, but converting something that starts with a ridiculous amount of lasers into something else just costs more scrap which may not be the best thing.  Since this is a gunship, buying additional systems may not be as high a priority as on other ships. Hacking is always nice and cloaking would be good if you have weapons with long charge times. As well, since your tactics are basically ""set to autofire and win"", focus on upgrading your systems rather getting more. You can worry about getting hacking a cloaking later on.  To sum it up, the Red-Tail is one of the best gunships in the game. If you're new to the game, start with what you've been given (a gunship) and build on that (MORE DAKKA)."
ftlgame,39z5pv,MalaclypseTheEldar,7,Tue Jun 16 00:06:13 2015 UTC,"This guide is true, in all levels   Lasers are really really really good at breaking shields, and the two things that go well with that are beams and more lasers. I'll focus on those.   More lasers are better lasers   MORE DAKKA   Yes.  Personally, I find the Red-Tail to be a great, reliable, and versatile ship, if you remember to improve your firepower, because eventually four shots won't cut it."

ftlgame,39z5pv,dryerlintcompelsyou,16,Tue Jun 16 02:41:21 2015 UTC,"Rookie mistake, you need to time your laser to shoot them all at once :  1) Pew Pew Pew Pew 2) ??? 3) Profit"
ftlgame,39z5pv,Kuirem,2,Tue Jun 16 05:40:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, I find just one level of hacking to be super helpful for Red-Tail, just so you can briefly hack their piloting and make all of your lasers hit."
ftlgame,39z5pv,Hogwarts9876,2,Tue Jun 16 07:45:10 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that never buying weapons would be a large mistake many times. Seeing as the red-tail is so strong early, the only thing you should be afraid of is failing to find better weapons and falling behind in damage later. I always try to save enough scrap so that if a BL2 is for sale I can grab it."
ftlgame,39z5pv,Neoviper,2,Tue Jun 16 17:25:01 2015 UTC,"I meant for the early sectors, where you don't get much scrap anyway, you should use that scrap for upgrading your defenses since your offense is good enough. Later on you should probably get weapons if you're still stuck with stock."
ftlgame,39z5pv,MalaclypseTheEldar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:44:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Yeah, certainly you need to get some defenses at least in the first sector. After the second shield bubble and maybe some engines I start saving, though that's just the way I do it."
ftlgame,39z5pv,Neoviper,10,Tue Jun 16 20:09:38 2015 UTC,"Don't sell off any starting Basic Laser you can equip until you will definitely never use it again.  1 power for 1 laser on a low cooldown is a perfectly reasonable weapon.  Replacing 2 Basic Lasers with 1 Chain laser actually makes your build WORSE - wait until you have bought the Weapons System Level to bring it online, etc."
ftlgame,39z5pv,Twinge,7,Tue Jun 16 02:01:01 2015 UTC,"Great advice from /u/Twinge as always.  The big difference with the red-tail compared to any other starting ship is that it has no free weapon slots.  You don't add firepower to the Red-Tail, you upgrade it.  I personally like to use my cargo hold to start accumulating weapons for an upgraded loadout.  Bombs and  beams can be very nice weapons, but you can accidentally reduce your firepower by incorporating them too early."
ftlgame,39z5pv,Histidine,8,Tue Jun 16 10:34:35 2015 UTC,"My strategy is usually seek out moar lasers to gradually replace my starting lasers. What exactly are you having problems with? It has the best layout in the game and a strong starting crew, and a starting loadout that can take you through the first two or three sectors without upgrades. Should be fairly easy to make progress with."
ftlgame,39z5pv,Spacetime_Inspector,4,Tue Jun 16 00:02:08 2015 UTC,"The Red-Tail is neat because it starts with more laser firepower than the Kestral (or most anything else, really) but none of those Basic Lasers have any real lasting appeal - something like the Heavy Laser 1 is better in every regard, or the Small Bomb for system disabling on 1 power.   Try to gradually build up the dakka by substituting in Flaks or Burst Lasers (ideally BL2), and play dirty like mind-controlling pilots to give the enemy a brief 0% dodge chance, or hack to lower shields for a 4-laser punch."
ftlgame,39z5pv,51Gunner,2,Tue Jun 16 04:58:53 2015 UTC,"in my current run, I've replaced a laser with a Flak Cannon, and I'm working my way to getting enough power to power a Flak 2."
ftlgame,39z5pv,Neoviper,3,Tue Jun 16 05:02:18 2015 UTC,"Be very cautious in using flak 2, the charge time can leave you very vulnerable if your defenses aren't up to par. If your current weapons are strong enough, hold off on powering that flak."
ftlgame,39z5pv,Histidine,3,Tue Jun 16 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"Some non-weapon tips for the Red-Tail.  You start with a diverse crew so it's best to take advantage of their abilities.  Zoltan works best in the shield room to start working a layer of un-ionizable shields plus its right next to the medbay for easy health.  Rockman is best at the helm because it is so isolated so the high health means fewer trips to the medbay.  Human works well at engines and doubles as your repair man when needed.  Mantis goes to weapons to start, then moves to something else once a better crew member arrives.  With 4 lasers your weapons guy will level up quickly anyway.  Your systems should be in upgraded in the normal route (lvl 2 shields -> 4 engines -> 2 doors) initially before trying to go for any optional systems.  Since you start out with two good fighters, getting a teleporter is generally a good option, one that works reasonably well with a gunship.  Just be careful with autofire.  Beyond that this is a pretty standard ship.  Only other advice is to invest a second power bar into oxygen as a damage buffer.  As a 2x2 room in the middle of your ship, it seems to get hit/attacked more often than in other designs.  Something to consider once your ship is well established (sector 4+)."

ftlgame,39was6,DiscordDraconequus,8,Mon Jun 15 11:39:00 2015 UTC,"^  @ /u/Bloody_Lemon:  If you have a pre-igniter then maybe you can make this work by going all out offensively and destroying the flagship before it can beat you.  Without any defenses the flagship will just rip you to shreds.  With a pre-igniter and cloaking you can maybe get off two volleys before things start going to shit.  Pop the battery, hack shields, fire ze missiles, steal power from hacking with zoltans and beef up cloaking, cloak the first volley they send at you, and then fire your second volley.    The issue here is you aren't in a position to neutralize all of the threats against you so you have to win as fast as possible.  Without a pre-igniter (or incredible luck) you'll get torn to shreds and all your stuff will be turned off.  If you're feeling really dedicated you can save scum to earn multiple shots at the flagship.  Consider it a learning experience.  Practically what I see happening is you'd take 2 or 3 shots at it before concluding that your setup isn't going to work.  Then you have to start over and try again!  Oh, and also finish upgrading anything you can, you want as much buffer as possible because you will be taking lots and lots of damage!"

ftlgame,39sspe,Adamtess,4,Sun Jun 14 21:16:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP, but maybe I can help.  My plan is to spend my first 25 scrap on a weapons system buffer - this is the single most effective way at taking less damage, since you can still keep firing on enemy ships even if you take one damage - and most of the time you'll be taking one damage since heavy lasers will be blocked by your shield and small bombs are slower than your main weapons. Drones + heavy laser can still be an issue but are thankfully rare (and the heavy laser might target something else instead).  Next I spend 20 scrap on a drone system buffer (and to run both drones at the same time).  After that, I save up for shields, and can buy it most of the time in sector 2, or very early sector 3. You kind of have to play it by ear at that point since the run's status could diverge wildly.  ...  As for early game tactics, it plays basically like the Stealth A, except you can take full advantage of your charge laser to fire off single shots if the enemy shield system is down."

ftlgame,39sz88,jackcal,48,Sun Jun 14 13:53:22 2015 UTC,"RNG stands for Random Number Generator. In FTL context for example there are events that have multiple outcomes even if you do the same action. There is the infamous Giant Alien Spider event, where if you try to help the station you have a 50% chance to lose a crew member and a 50% chance to win and get a reward. The Random Number Generator comes up with a random number and from that number determines the outcome. Think of it as rolling a dice, if you roll 1 2 or 3 you lose if you role 4 5 or 6 you win.  I'd say most video games have some kind of RNG, but it's not as important in many of them as it is in FTL. With games like FTL, where those random outcomes make a huge difference for your run, many players jokingly refer to RNG as if it was a deity that is either benevolent or angry at them. Hence RNGesus."
ftlgame,39sz88,Eirh,5,Sun Jun 14 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"Random number generator. It determines what you ""roll"" in any game's chance option. It is a pseudo generator for most computer as it is a combination of factors mixed with the Unix Timestamp. For the example, let's use the milliseconds place of Unix time to represent a computer's RNG.  Say you want to help the crew in the ""giant alien spider"" event. Your odds are 50% 1 crew loss and 50% (medium?) reward. FTL would check the Unix time for over 4 or under 5. If you roll a 0, it counts as lower than 5.   Another example is a laser landing a hit or not. Say you have %20 evasion. The system would check the time stamp. If it reads a 0 or 1, it misses. If it reads any other number, it hits.  Basically, it gives a computer the ability to be random(or procedurally generated) rather than entirely scripted.   RNGsus is the embodiment of RNG as a deity. Because RNG is random, short term patterns do appear and folks will sometimes consider it a sign of a higher digital being controlling the RNG."
ftlgame,39sz88,NEXT_VICTIM,8,Sun Jun 14 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"RNG stands for Rolling Number Generator or something similar. Usually a RNG would be used in RPGs or board games.

Don't think of number generators as a complex machine. It's literally just a random number selector, it's sort of like a dice the computer can roll.  For example, you come up to the giant spider event, and you press ""Fuck it, let's do it"", and the computer rolls its little dice and it determines what happens based on that dice."

It's why sometimes you get really good events and lots is scrap and then you get to the store and your favorite weapon is for sale, and then sometimes you hit an enemy you're completely unprepared for and die in sector one. The RNG isn't for decisions, it decides the options and situations available to the player."

If you want to max out scraps or get a final critical upgrade on your ship in sector 8, you may want to beat up as many rebel ships as possible in The Last Stand before having to face the flagship, and while they're uncommon, there are some jump nodes in The Last Stand that yields nothing at all and waste time, so LRS can help with that."

ftlgame,39u58g,mr_easy_money,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"Well you're assuming he had opportunities to come accross better alternatives, which isn't all guaranteed. Many a game I find myself not finding any augment (or missing them by lack of scraps/availability of better options at shops) whatsoever. LRS come with the Stealth ship but they aren't an ""instal-sell"" upgrade as with Mantis Pheromones, Engi Med-bot or Crystal Vengeance as they're useful to spot ships when you have a strong setup (or avoid them when you don't) to generate more scraps, spot some Homeworld events (Zoltan and Rebel ones don't have ships so if you're after them you can get a few more of ""non ships"" beacons to try and get them), and also to avoid hazard you're not comfortable with. Also LRS are very useful in Nebulae.  I'm just making a case about how it's totally not a bad idea to keep them through a whole game under most circumstances, and when you're in sector 8 there is very little chance you'll get to sell them as there is only one shop, limited times and rebels are closing beacons randomly.  But I agree there are a lot of options over them that'd help, that's absolutely true."
ftlgame,39u58g,Elr3d,2,Wed Jun 17 12:45:04 2015 UTC,"When you pick your weapons, think about how it will go. These are slow and power hungry, although not exactly 'bad' by themselves.

ftlgame,39u58g,mekloz,2,Sun Jun 14 21:33:05 2015 UTC,You had a lot of scrap going into that. You should have upgraded the piloting and buffered other things as well.
ftlgame,39u58g,Stryke_RG,2,Sun Jun 14 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"Your weapons and augmentations could be a whole lot worse, but you should really be buying more systems. I tend to buy based on my ship's needs and weaknesses by the mid or late game. If my weapons can't realistically get through four shields, for example, I think about hacking. If I have more crew than I need to man the important systems and they're good combatants, teleporting and MC (although MC is very nice to have by itself, especially against phase 3 of the flagship; don't rule it out just because you can't board). Defense drones are also useful since they can shoot down boarding and hacking drones, both of which the flagship uses. Shield drones pair nicely with cloaking, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get one."
ftlgame,39u58g,BepisChristmas,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:04:13 2015 UTC,"don't rule it out just because you can't board   Pretty sure mind control doesn't go through super shields either unless you have super shield bypass... however, it's nice to un-mind control your own crew until you can take down the flagships MC."
ftlgame,39u58g,nitro67,2,Mon Jun 15 20:23:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's pretty much what I meant. By phase 3 I try to have as many would-be boarders dead as possible, but having MC is still very helpful because it makes the flagship's own MC system a non-issue.

ftlgame,39u58g,BepisChristmas,2,Mon Jun 15 21:10:08 2015 UTC,Gotcha. I was just confused for a moment. Mind control and boarding is one of my favorite builds. I tend to pair them way more than I should for my own good.

ftlgame,39ud1h,51Gunner,4,Sun Jun 14 21:18:36 2015 UTC,"I'd keep flak, BL II and pikes (only run one for now). Also, buy drone control, nothing should be able to kill you if you have hull repair and so many parts. Or not, you don't really need it.  Which sector is it, are you gonna get to upgrade more?  If you want to board, you could keep flak, BL II and ions, less damage to hull and more to systems.  @edit I see you're in sector 5 now. You should be perfectly fine here no matter what you do, really.  If you don't want to sell you could maybe jump around the store for extra scrap. If there's space."

ftlgame,39ud1h,Pentbot,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:20:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if it comes with Defense Drone I then get that.  Get the extra money from selling a pike beam and an ion - put the flak in place of the ion you sell - and for the time being, run your weapons as; soften up the shield with flak+b.laser, and then use your pike to slice up whats left.  The Drone control in conjunction with the Hull Repair will help make repairs cheaper in the later sections - and that way your money can go towards cooler stuff."
ftlgame,39ud1h,Dude579,2,Wed Jun 17 11:25:08 2015 UTC,"It looks like you need to make a choice between which weapons to use together; ion & beam, laser (and flak) & beam or ion & laser. Maybe ion and beam is good in combonation with teleporter and hacking.  Drone control with defense drone is the best option due to the hull repair drone and is cheap for what you get. Cloaking is to expensive to invest in imo."
ftlgame,39ud1h,KamiForever,2,Sun Jun 14 22:35:20 2015 UTC,Just like /u/mekloz id invest flak + BL2 and double pike. Flak and BL2's give a combined volley of 6. Which will be able to pen the mothership shields.  Hacking pilot = 0 evade and + 6 volley = guaranteed shields broken on the mothership. So you will win :p

Not every ship layout is going to make the most out of the augment but I would argue that it's one of the best in the game.

ftlgame,39rvrb,superfantastic1,3,Sun Jun 14 04:13:53 2015 UTC,Just check this video out.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79_SivNcVeA  I know I've lost with it before. Partly because my weapons weren't very strong to begin with. I won't always buy it in stores either. Now if Zoltan shields were for sale I might always buy that.  We're probably on the same page in regards to its usefulness. Having weapon pre-igniter without strong weapons is about as useful as zoltan shield with no evasion. I guess this is what I like about FTL. Nothing will guarantee a win.

The advantage you get is honestly insane, you just need to switch up your game to rely more on heavier slower weapons."
ftlgame,39rvrb,burning1rr,7,Sun Jun 14 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"The effectiveness of pre-igniter is inversely related to the charge time of your weapons. It's worthless if you're running IB2, Charge Ion, Charge Lasers, and drones, and incredibly OP if you're running Glaive beam, Flak 2, and Ion Bomb.  Also keep in mind that one function of upgraded cloak can be to act as a poor-man's (or rich-man's?) WPI. So because you already had cloak, the benefit of the pre-igniter was marginally diminished, since they both have a primary of function of giving you time that the enemy doesn't have to charge your weapons. On a ship without all the other advantages you had, WPI can truly be a 'godsend'."
ftlgame,39rvrb,Eirh,2,Sun Jun 14 06:35:53 2015 UTC,That's a valid point about the cloak. I did kind of feel like they were a bit redundant. Although they also worked well together being able to shoot then cloak and then fire again.
ftlgame,39rvrb,Leylite,6,Sun Jun 14 18:41:24 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the build. If you have a full compliment of BL2 and Flack cannons, an extra re-loader is often more valuable than a pre-ignitor. If you have a compliment of long charging weapons, it can be a god-send.  The pre-ignitor isn't as beneficial for the boss fight, because the boss is a damage sponge. You'll get one shot off early, but it usually isn't enough to cripple the boss.  It's true benefit is the early take-downs of ships through the game. In many cases, you can disable a ship before that ship can harm you. The result is a lot less scrap spent on repairs, which works out to a more powerful ship for the bossfight.  Of course, some builds can take down the boss in 1 salvo using a pre-ignitor and hacking."
ftlgame,39rvrb,Antinerf,3,Sun Jun 14 07:25:27 2015 UTC,"Pre Igniter is both one of the most overrated augments and still one of the strongest augments. The strength of the Pre Igniter very much depends on your weapons. Some weapon setups don't really benefit from it too much (such as if your weapons are mostly there for boarding support and to attack if you board the shields down) some benefit from it a lot (say Glaive Beam, Flak II and Ion Bomb on a 3 weapon slot ship).  It's by far the most expensive augment, and I think it deserves that spot. Some people go all out though, once they find a pre igniter and try to get it at all cost, which often dooms their run in the long term (""I don't know why I lost, I was pretty lucky and even got a pre igniter! Well I had to sell 2 laser weapons to get the pre igniter but still""). The Pre Igniter won't magically save a run, it's good for what it is, but most of the time too expensive to be the best thing at a shop.  Others already said that you can get a similar effect to the pre igniter just by using stealth (which is the whole point behind stealth B). While stealth more expensive of course, it's better than the pre igniter and much more reliable to get during a run.  The pre igniter exploit (I once made a video about it, someone else already linked it) is a niche trick that's rarely actually usefull, but it still is useful from time to time. When you have one of those rare setups that can make use of it, it's a cool thing to show off.  Now one of the best things about the Pre Igniter is that you can save a lot of time in a run with it. If you need to play optimally to win a run it can take quite a while, when you already have a decent weapon setup a pre igniter speeds up the game a lot. Time is often limited, so having a pre igniter often just means you can do more than without it."

You don't really need more drones - just use level 2 hacking to take down their shields and fire the Hull Beam and Dual Lasers, taking down shields first. If you like you can activate the Beam drone as well (just be careful not to spend too many drone parts), with the shields down it should do short work of their hull. Get 2 more weapon power soon ( so you can power the Charge Laser too. I would sell the Anti-Drone as it is pretty useless though."
ftlgame,39o2yj,corvid_,2,Sat Jun 13 08:35:16 2015 UTC,"You should be careful about depending on drones unless you can get DRA.

You can use the dual lasers and drone or hacking through the first 2 sectors fairly reliably. Try to hit up the shops and look for a drone recovery arm.  Once you have the arm, your goal should be to add a 2nd attack drone. At this point you can use hacking AND drones in every battle.  As long as you only use 1 drone part in most battles, drones aren't a major limitation with this build. Lots of enemies drop a drone. Obviously, never sell drone parts for scrap, and take surrenders that offer lots of drone parts. With that said, use a drone plus hacking when needed.  Door upgrade is mandatory. Try to get it in sector 2.  Don't sell the dual lasers. Keep an eye out for flack 1 and bl 2. You will eventually need weapons, but not until sector 3."

ftlgame,39j7dk,emwhalen,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:04:54 2015 UTC,I think there's also a blue option for the boarding drone. Literally the only time it was ever useful for me.
ftlgame,39j7dk,apemanzilla,17,Tue Jun 16 16:25:46 2015 UTC,Engines before shields really? I always try to get level 3 shields before I upgrade engines usually. I'll try upgrading engines at level 2 shields next time I play I think.
ftlgame,39j7dk,Berttheduck,28,Fri Jun 12 09:49:08 2015 UTC,"Well. Max engines before max shields, pretty much always. That's a better way to put it, the wording in my first post was a bit misleading.   Shields stop lasers and beams. That's all.  Engines stop everything (well, not boarders or beams, but hey), and if you do the maths they're exponentially more useful at higher levels (even if at first the reduced % gain for higher scrap seems like it's not worth it). Plus improved engines give you a bunch of useful blue options (compared with none for improved shields), and it's better to have those opportunities earlier in the game. Not to mention higher evasion = faster level ups for your pilot/engineer.  Getting to lvl3 shields before even touching your engines is pretty much just a bad tactic and inefficient scrap usage in the long run. I learned this myself the hard way, because when I first started playing FTL I was the same way. So are most new players. Shields seem much more useful, but the longer you play and the more times you win, the more you realise they're really not.  Of course like all things in FTL, it is pretty situational, there are some situations when shields are going to be more helpful. But with most ships, a fairly good rule of thumb for an 'average' run:  lvl 2/3 engines -> lvl 2 shields -> lvl 5 engines -> lvl 3 shields > lvl 7/8 engines > lvl 4 shields  The only exception really is level 2 shields, which are super useful to get early if you have a spare 50 scrap early on, just because it makes the first 2 or 3 sectors much, much easier. But the further the game goes, the more engines become more useful than shields. Especially when you're facing more and more enemies with flak, missiles and bombs."
ftlgame,39j7dk,kinggimped,14,Fri Jun 12 10:08:50 2015 UTC,"The utility of early shields is hard to argue against, the buffer alone can save you a load of hull. It protects you from missiles by proxy, so the other stuff doesn't kill you right away after shields get hit.  As for the high level stuff, I think someone actually did the math somewhere, and it was comparable, only better against different types of attack.  The blue options are mostly to run, so...  Upgrading in the middle sectors depends heavily on other stuff. If you have dd/cloak, it's better to get a high guaranteed beam stopper. Similarly when you visit missile-low sectors.  Diving and missile sectors means engines.   lvl 7/8 engines > lvl 4 shields   The drone surge alone can make it worth it to take level 4 shields. Unless you have cloak. I guess there's really no way to write this stuff out like it's the ultimate truth or something.   The only exception really is level 2 shields   Right, I suppose ignore my first paragraph. Sorry."
ftlgame,39j7dk,mekloz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:24:55 2015 UTC,"The blue options are mostly to run, so...   Sometimes it's the better tactical option to run. It also gives you a few new crew opportunities.  Then again I'm one of those people who upgrade medbay early pretty much every game, just because it gives you so many new crew blue text opportunities, which are invaluable early on. The upgraded engines giving you blue texts is really an afterthought.   The drone surge alone can make it worth it to take level 4 shields. Unless you have cloak. I guess there's really no way to write this stuff out like it's the ultimate truth or something.   By stage 3 flagship I'll generally have 50-55% evasion. 3 shield bubbles last a lot longer when half the shots are missing. Give me 3 shield bubbles and ~50% evasion any day over 4 shield bubbles and 35% evasion.  The real danger during the drone surge are the beam drones, because if they score just a couple of hits to good rooms, the fight can get away from you real fast. Good evasion and those beam drones will never get a chance.  3rd stage power surge fires 8 lasers, that can be a slight hassle with only 3 shield bubbles, but honestly I've lost count of the number of times I've easily beaten the last stage with lvl 3 shields. Besides, even if one gets through you can usually ride it. And you should really have L1 cloaking by then anyway, which pretty much completely counters the power surge lasers AND the drone surge.  And like I said, it's all situational. There's no ultimate truth, which is what makes FTL such a great (and replayable!) game.  Depending on ship, I'll pretty much always get level 2 shields early. But those first couple of engine upgrades are so damn cheap and that early 10% evasion boost negates so much early damage and levels up your pilot/engineer so much faster in the early game, they're worth it. My argument for engines is mainly against upgrading shields and totally ignoring engines, rather than upgrading shields more than engines.  When I see one of the millions of ""ermahgerd, so close, I'll get you next time flagship"" screenshots that show somebody losing to the boss with level 4 shields, a sweet weapon loadout, and level 3 engines... my immediate reaction is that the person is very new to the game. Or not very good at it. Nowadays I'd consider that loudout a challenge run!"
ftlgame,39j7dk,kinggimped,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:39:51 2015 UTC,"Mostly feel the same about everything, but I'm quite convinced that drone surge is better with full shields. It's not just about evading vs blocking the shots, either - the recharge plays a significant role, too. If it starts earlier, it will raise a bubble earlier, and a drone or two or four might not get a shot through. Oh, and the shield is cheaper."
ftlgame,39j7dk,mekloz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:49:33 2015 UTC,"To each their own. Obviously having 4 shield bubbles is better than 3. But overall in my experience of playing the game, engines are just a more bankable upgrade than shields. Been saved by clutch evasions way too many times.  The only reason I even mentioned it is because I'd consider it sound advice for newbies to the game (like OP), since the vast majority of new players would immediately consider shields to be a much better upgrade every time."
ftlgame,39j7dk,kinggimped,2,Fri Jun 12 11:52:10 2015 UTC,"I've seen plenty of vets with screenshots of coming very close to beating the final boss, with 200+ scrap in their cargo, and level 2 O2,  doors, medbay etc. Completely upgraded engines, level 3 sensors and... you guessed it, level 3 shields. Like, I understand engines are actually better than shields, but that doesn't mean don't get that 4th shield up. Especially if you have the resources. So many close games that could have been saved."

ftlgame,39j7dk,itsamamaluigi,2,Fri Jun 12 15:13:19 2015 UTC,"It's also less that they have around 200 unspent scrap, it's that they blew their scrap on upgrades that don't really help near as much as that 4th shield. I'm not here to argue about the effectiveness of engines vs. shields. Everyone here can agree that it's some combination of the two. The vets I see blow their scrap and energy on things that really won't help as much as that 4th pip. It's really irritating how much its downplayed here."

You could compare 40% & Tier 4 Shields versus 51% & Tier 3 is the closest cost-wise, though you're still looking at 1 extra unbought Engine power in that example.   The real danger during the drone surge are the beam drones   I think the reason you say this is because you upgrade Engines over Shields =)  If you have Tier 4 Shields you're generally going to be more concerned with the Combat Drones taking down your Shields to allow any damage to get through in the first place.   3rd stage power surge fires 8 lasers, that can be a slight hassle with only 3 shield bubbles   Did the math out of curiosity - using the numbers above (3 bubble + 51% evasion versus 4 bubbles + 40%).  You'll take an average of 1.03 damage with 4 bubbles and 1.12 with 3 bubbles and higher Engines.   My argument for engines is mainly against upgrading shields and totally ignoring engines, rather than upgrading shields more than engines.   That we can all agree on =)"
ftlgame,39j7dk,Twinge,5,Sat Jun 13 10:17:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I see your point. Think I'll stick to upgrading shields to level 2 first near cuz you take so much damage I the first couple sectors otherwise but I'll definitely focus more on engines now. Thanks for explaining that.

ftlgame,39j7dk,Ionalien,2,Fri Jun 12 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"if you do the maths they're exponentially more useful at higher levels   This isn't actually very true in practice.  It's important to realize that yes, the higher your evasion is the more effective adding more evasion is, but the cost-effectiveness drops significantly.  Going from Level 5 Engines to Level 6 is literally half as cost effective in terms of effective dodge chance.   improved engines give you a bunch of useful blue options   It gives you approximately one, which only appears in Rock Sectors - it lets you avoid a 1 in 4 chance of losing a crewmember (which will also result in free scrap you don't get when using the Engines Blue Option if your crewmember doesn't die).  The rest of the options are all for running from fights, which is correct to do about once every 200 times you have the option.   higher evasion = faster level ups for your pilot/engineer   True, but generally not a huge deal as they tend to train relatively quickly regardless, especially if you upgrade them even a little (e.g. Level 3-4 levels up pretty rapidly).   Getting to lvl3 shields before even touching your engines is pretty much just a bad tactic   You will usually want to upgrade your Engines at least some before Tier 3 Shields, for sure.  This will depend a bit on the ship and the presence of a Defense Drone, which makes upgrading Engines much less urgent.   lvl 2/3 engines -> lvl 2 shields   Tier 2 Shields is probably the single most cost-effective upgrade you can get in the game.  Rushing it with your very first 50 scrap is rarely a bad choice, and it's certainly going to do more for you in the first 2 sectors than another Engine level will.  My standard progression probably looks more like:  Tier 2 Shields -> Level 3-4 Engines -> Tier 3 Shields -> Level 5 Engines -> Tier 4 Shields if I can justify the cost (~80% of the time?) -> That's it, never upgrade Engines past Level 5.  The cost effectiveness plummets so much that I don't find I actually get much value from those final Engine upgrades.  It is also worth noting, however, that Engine upgrades do increase FTL charge rate which can be helpful.  Notably Level 6 Engines + Trained Engineer can help you avoid ASB shots.  Short version: Engines are underrated by new players but overrated in this subreddit."
ftlgame,39j7dk,Twinge,8,Sat Jun 13 09:50:41 2015 UTC,"Level 2 shields first, then engines to 5, then level 3 shields, then whatever. Sometimes I'll go engines to 4, then shields to 3, then engines to 5, but whatever works.  Level 4 shields is more of a luxury than anything and I normally don't upgrade until the flagship fight. Most helpful for phases 2 and 3 of the flagship."
ftlgame,39j7dk,itsamamaluigi,3,Fri Jun 12 15:10:28 2015 UTC,I've read alot of help files and took alot of advice from members here and I have always seen shields to be upgraded first. It's so you don't have to spend any money on repairs early on.
ftlgame,39j7dk,K41namor,6,Fri Jun 12 15:46:03 2015 UTC,"Getting shields lvl 2 early on in the game is really strong. I'm not saying don't upgrade shields at all. I'm saying that in the long run, engine upgrades are more scrap efficient than shield upgrades. A lot of new players don't realise that and focus all their scrap on getting to shields lvl4, totally neglecting to upgrade engines beyond a couple of levels.  I don't mean put all your early scrap into engines and ignore shields. I can see how my wording might have been confusing."

ftlgame,39j7dk,RedMarz,2,Fri Jun 12 02:39:09 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you something important. With this game, you will either die several times, get very frustrated and quit or you will die several times, get very frustrated and keep playing and playing until your life gets sucked out of you, but you still die over and over again. (in the very far future, you may become a pro, but don't count on it.)"
ftlgame,39j7dk,Immortails,2,Fri Jun 12 22:21:11 2015 UTC,Start on easy! Not normal.
ftlgame,39j3oq,BepisChristmas,30,Fri Jun 12 02:01:19 2015 UTC,"Now you'll remember it for next time! It's always a joy to find one of these ships, because as long as you can tank their loadout you can just hit the oxygen once and wait a couple minutes to get those sweet crew-dead rewards, even without a boarding ship."
ftlgame,39j3oq,Spacetime_Inspector,9,Fri Jun 12 03:16:59 2015 UTC,"I think my first achievement that wasn't ""get to sector x with y restrictions"" was from one of these beauties - knocking out the O2 then going off to get a coffee while the enemy crew sloooowly asphyxiated. Yesssss."
ftlgame,39j3oq,--cheese--,10,Fri Jun 12 03:54:12 2015 UTC,"This makes me wonder how many times I've encountered ships like this without even noticing, because I've always assumed every room had to have at least one door connecting it to another room (easy/normal flagship notwithstanding, of course). The only reason I even noticed it on this one was because my crystalman was unable to leave the oxygen room."
ftlgame,39j3oq,JRutterbush,3,Fri Jun 12 04:08:36 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this is the only one, and that it was a mistake (which is why it's the only one)."
ftlgame,39j3oq,Eirh,11,Fri Jun 12 06:40:48 2015 UTC,"No I really don't think it was a mistake. It's one of the easier enemy ships you will find in earlier sectors and it gives players lots of interesting ways to go for it, especially if you notice the door thing. I'd say it's really an example of good encounter design, because it rewards clever usage of the game mechanics."
ftlgame,39j3oq,ChummyCommie,4,Fri Jun 12 11:26:24 2015 UTC,It's one of the easier enemy ships you will find in earlier sectors   That used to be true before the AE update. Now you only encounter this kind of ship in Slug sector or certain events involving slugs like slug hunting refugee ship. The pirate version now has a completely different layout.
ftlgame,39j3oq,Eirh,2,Fri Jun 12 16:01:34 2015 UTC,Yeah but later nebula and slug sectors won't have this ship. It's only found in earlier sectors.
ftlgame,39j3oq,anace,3,Fri Jun 12 20:04:51 2015 UTC,There's one more; it's a medium-size mantis ship with the oxygen room top-center. (Pretty sure it's not CE)
ftlgame,39j3oq,RemusShepherd,2,Fri Jun 12 13:41:39 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a mistake.  At release, the two crew members were both in the connected pilot-shield-weapon section.  A patch later on put one crew member in the disconnected engine bay, presumably to irritate boarding crews.  Whoever designed this ship knew what they were doing."
ftlgame,39j3oq,ais523,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:21:10 2015 UTC,"Not a patch so much; it's the difference between Normal (both in the middle) and Hard (one in the engine room), and this is because on Hard, the second crew member always idles in the engine room while not in a fight. So it might just be coincidence."
ftlgame,39j3oq,CH33z8URgR,5,Sun Jun 21 21:34:40 2015 UTC,Thank goodness for clone bays!
ftlgame,39jn5w,Friiman,6,Fri Jun 12 04:48:02 2015 UTC,Pew pew pew!  I don't suppose you have a video/gif? Would be great to see that in action.
ftlgame,39jn5w,Orcwin,2,Fri Jun 12 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"No! The run was over before I knew what happened. My shield guy didn't even block enough shots get to lvl 2 by the end of the run... ...damn, now I wish I had a video..."
ftlgame,39jn5w,Orcwin,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:29:10 2015 UTC,"Aw, pity.  That's an interesting naming convention you have for your crew, by the way."

ftlgame,39jn5w,geoben,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:40:53 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong I would never sell a WPI, but this has to be one of the quickest loading setups I've ever seen (besides the chain laser) and its almost sad that the WPI gets so little use on this ship compared to one that has longer weapon load times.  Still helps a ton I bet."
ftlgame,39jn5w,kendrone,3,Fri Jun 12 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"The quick volley at the start means a good chance to disable any critical threats, such as hacking or a rack of missiles. In effect, the WPI becomes a defence drone of its own."
ftlgame,39jn5w,geoben,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not discrediting its usefulness at all. Just thought out of all the scenarios where you could have one, this is the least game-changing."
ftlgame,39jn5w,Dude579,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:04:02 2015 UTC,"This was its best use. If I unpaused and they launched a hack, they got eleven blasts pointed right at that system. Then five seconds later everything was ready for better targets."
ftlgame,39jn5w,geoben,2,Fri Jun 12 23:27:03 2015 UTC,Kinda works well with the chain laser since it eliminates its longest time. I wonder how effective 4 chain lasers would be in general.
ftlgame,39knxz,Lunaria-Stalis,5,Fri Jun 12 11:51:11 2015 UTC,"I finally did it, I beat the game on hard with all layouts! But there is one achievement I do not have that I consider a bit weird. I have never since I started playing FTL achieved the ""The United Federation"" achievement! :P  And this is after beating the game with every layout on both normal and hard, not mention playing quite a bit with the kestrel when I first started out with this game years ago!"
ftlgame,39knxz,Kuirem,3,Fri Jun 12 11:53:18 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, welcome in the club of all ships but not all achievements.  The United Federation is not really hard (play Kestrel B and go into Slug, Rock and Lanius sectors) but it's not an achievement you get in a normal playthrough."
ftlgame,39knxz,DoylePTB,2,Fri Jun 12 12:24:55 2015 UTC,You'd think that one would get it after having played so much though. :p
ftlgame,39knxz,Kuirem,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:30:55 2015 UTC,"Just to confirm, you can obtain achievements with the B and C versions of them?"
ftlgame,39hjxu,scorpzrage,4,Thu Jun 11 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if I missed something, but why not jump away then jump back to the base? That would reset where the hacking drone hits."
ftlgame,39hjxu,rootwinterguard,5,Thu Jun 11 23:49:34 2015 UTC,"As I said in the other reply, I didn't think of that.  On the other hand, I'm not sure if I'd have been lucky enough to not take any damage before Missiles, Ion and Laser would have been down again.  In the end, I somehow got through it and have learned that the flagship doesn't seem to have 100% evasion while cloaking, so there's that."
ftlgame,39hjxu,ChummyCommie,2,Fri Jun 12 00:05:57 2015 UTC,"Cloaking add 60% evasion while it is active. Since the Flagship only has 2 engine bar in phase 1, it effectively has 80% evasion while cloaked if both engine and pilot are manned."
ftlgame,39hjxu,SmartAlec105,4,Fri Jun 12 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"Whenever I try to do boarding against the Flagship, I hack the cloaking room and then send my guys in to the door room. Once they've killed that guy, they go and kill the guy in the cloaking room. Then other guys try to get in to the cloaking room and then they become trapped. So then you've killed all of the enemies in the main part of the ship and you just have to take down whatever system is causing you the most annoyance such as hacking or shields."
ftlgame,39hjxu,Mario-C,5,Fri Jun 12 00:03:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't have hacking and no means of taking out the Medbay, so fighting the enemy crew was hopeless, since they'd just swap and heal up.  Edit: Oh, I see what you mean. But, since I didn't have hacking, it wouldn't have been an option. Guess I'll have to try that in some other run then, sounds fun."
ftlgame,39hjxu,chewbacca77,2,Fri Jun 12 00:08:02 2015 UTC,That's a cool tactic man! Have to try it.
ftlgame,39hjxu,eriktheguy,2,Sat Jun 13 07:34:10 2015 UTC,"That's rough.  Grats on the win, though.  It was well earned.  Keep in mind that unless the flagship is about to destroy your base, you can always jump away and have them re-hack something else."
ftlgame,39j5lj,JCFPE,5,Fri Jun 12 02:16:50 2015 UTC,"Hostile Engi ships almost always have defense drones, and I think they're most common in Engi and Zoltan sectors."
ftlgame,39j5lj,BepisChristmas,3,Fri Jun 12 02:26:14 2015 UTC,The best way to find an enemy ship with a defense drone is not to be attempting to get the achievement Defense Drones Don't Do D'anything.
ftlgame,39j5lj,Captain_Lord_Avalon,3,Fri Jun 12 21:25:00 2015 UTC,Unfortunately a victory with Rock B is the only thing between me and crystals.
ftlgame,39j5lj,Antinerf,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:26:37 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea for you: Get a loadout with two missiles or more each salvo. The drone can only target one :)  Use whichever rocket gets through to hopefully disable the drone. Pound the drone system 'til it's completely broken and then focus on weapons (if they're too much of a threat, focus on them first). Switch back and forth until the ship is destroyed."
ftlgame,39j5lj,Leylite,2,Sun Jun 14 19:44:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only two ship types in the game that have defense drones are Engi ships and Rebel Riggers (and pirate riggers). So you definitely want to go to a Rebel sector if you have a choice so you can fight plenty of Rebel Riggers.  You may also want to raise the difficulty to Normal or Hard, so that enemy ships have larger drone budgets and you're more likely to see a sector 1 or 2 enemy with exactly 3 drone bars, meaning it could have a Defense I + System Repair/Anti-Drone or Defense II."
ftlgame,39me39,ilovetoeatpoutine,14,Fri Jun 12 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"7516 scrap, 555 missiles, 183 drones, and a crew full of Lanius...  ಠ_ಠ"

ftlgame,39me39,laerteis,2,Fri Jun 12 22:52:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah you have a good point, but why the number hacks? kinda ruins the point IMO.

ftlgame,39i36w,eriktheguy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:46:04 2015 UTC,"With hacking and Mind Control you're guaranteed to destroy weapons on your first volley: hack the shields, fire when they're down, pause mid volley (I do it right after the second burst shot is fired), mind control the pilot, unpause, cackle maniacally as they only have at the most something like 10% evade (more like either nothing or 4% to be honest, lvl3 piloting is really uncommon)."
ftlgame,39hi10,Chimpo1248,3,Thu Jun 11 19:19:21 2015 UTC,You need AE to unlock the next ship without completing the quest.
ftlgame,39hi10,mymindpsychee,5,Thu Jun 11 19:50:58 2015 UTC,You need the AE update to do that but you don't actually need to have AE turned on. Seems unlikely that anyone would be running the game without any updates now; I guess if they got it from somewhere other than Steam over a year ago and never checked for updates it could happen.
ftlgame,39hi10,itsamamaluigi,2,Thu Jun 11 21:11:04 2015 UTC,You have to beat it with different ships to get different unlocks.

ftlgame,39ddjh,chewbacca77,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:15:29 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, I didn't even notice that.   OP: For future reference, the Burst Laser 2 is probably the best non-unique weapon in the game. You should definitely never sell it.  Also, if you have such a great weapon system, you should really focus on getting defense systems like stealth/defense drone (stealth ideally). Mind control is really good for hacking piloting, but you're probably going to be fine without it, your main goal is just to survive for two volleys."
ftlgame,39ddjh,IlikeJG,9,Sun Jun 14 15:47:45 2015 UTC,It looks like the missile room isn't breached or on fire... I hope you weren't just shooting at it with flak and expecting more than a third of it to hit; that's what your heavy laser is for!
ftlgame,39ddjh,Leylite,3,Thu Jun 11 00:39:12 2015 UTC,I had just gotten the heavy laser and hadn't any scrap to upgrade weapons
ftlgame,39ddjh,Leylite,3,Thu Jun 11 01:08:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you could have turned off your second Flak I and used Flak II + Flak I to bust shields, then used the Heavy Laser as a follow-up."
ftlgame,39ddjh,chewbacca77,6,Thu Jun 11 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"Or better yet, forget about the Flak II.  Sure, it would breach the shields basically every time, but the six shots from the Flak I's will usually do that anyway."

ftlgame,39ddjh,MrNoS,10,Sun Jun 14 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you bought level 3 sensors.  They don't help you against the Flagship, and that scrap could have gone to upgrading weapons to level 8 to get the Heavy I online."
ftlgame,39ddjh,SmartAlec105,2,Thu Jun 11 03:53:20 2015 UTC,Well it does mean the sensors can be hit once before you start losing functionality.
ftlgame,39ddjh,MrNoS,3,Thu Jun 11 15:09:00 2015 UTC,"I really don't find sensors that useful, and see them as a luxury.  They're useful for seeing enemy concentration, but that can be tracked by watching doors open on the enemy ship.  Granted, I have a lot of experience with the game that can stand in for the functionality of sensors."
ftlgame,39ddjh,SmartAlec105,3,Thu Jun 11 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"On the flagship, you might think you have enough firepower that you can shoot a little at their missile launcher instead of their shields but if you saw 4 guys fixing the shields, you'd change your mind."
ftlgame,39ddjh,MrNoS,3,Thu Jun 11 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"Keeping that missile launcher suppressed is one of the most important part of fighting the flagship.  On most runs, it's the most dangerous weapon the flagship has.  Disabling it increases your survivability a lot, and on easy and normal killing the guy in that room (preferably on Phase I) means the damage you do stays done.  On hard, the AI prioritizes shield repair so missiles can still be suppressed.  I generally play on hard, so sensor upgrades are a luxury I can't afford."
ftlgame,39ddjh,dryerlintcompelsyou,4,Thu Jun 11 18:56:01 2015 UTC,"It's okay. In these situations, we can always take comfort in the fact that it'll only take one missile fired from some random Federation Fighter to take out the Flagship!  Well, Stage II at least"

Between the immediate WPI shot, zoltan shield, cloak and the drone, you've basically got the defense locked down. Way down...  Just upgrade piloting, shields (just in case) and the cloak a bit when you get a chance, and then max out the weapons for extra damage. You can kill phase one in 2 salvos that way if you don't miss nearly every shot other than what you need for shields.. Not that that would make a difference, really.  If you're considering keeping the vulcan, remember that even with the pre-igniter it will still take a lot of time to spool up, and then to take the shields down, too."
ftlgame,39cy8c,mekloz,2,Wed Jun 10 23:25:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here are saying to sell the Vulcan laser, first time in this subreddit, is it really that bad?    I once had a game with 2 Vulcans and a pre-igniter.  The first load is the longest so skipping that makes the dual vulcan's cut ships to shreds.  Also acts as drone defense because it hits them."
ftlgame,39cy8c,Nubcake_Jake,3,Sat Jun 13 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"It's not bad, but it's risky. A lot of good weapon combos rely on their opening salvo to cripple the enemy's offensive capability. (For example, Flak II + Beam + Pre-Igniter.). Vulcans aren't good at that because of how long they take to wind up, meaning you have to tank multiple salvos from their weapons. Plus if your Vulcan ever loses power it's really bad for you.   Of course Vulcans are still extremely powerful. But I posted this thread mostly because it was an interesting example of when and why to sell a Vulcan."
ftlgame,39cy8c,IlikeJG,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:39:08 2015 UTC,"Vulcan isn't bad, it's a really powerful weapon, especially when you've got a nice defensive set-up like OP does. Unfortunately, it takes a long time to get going and even OP's set-up will eventually succumb to RNG on some fights if the fights last long enough.   Preigniter + Flak 2/Halberd is a pretty much guaranteed weapon take down on every ship, with many ships just getting one-shot.  Selling vulcan is definitely the smartest play.  That being said, personally I would keep the vulcan, equip the hull missile, and buy the pre-igniter still, since it's so rare you actually are in a good enough position to use the vulcan effectively (amazing defense) and it's a fun weapon. The pre-igniter will actually help wind-up the vulcan more quickly, and the missle can be used to take out the opponents weapons. OP's in such a good position here that it'll be very hard for him to lose basically no matter what he does."
ftlgame,39cy8c,Abd_Kh66,4,Sun Jun 14 15:56:52 2015 UTC,definitely will get flak II and pre-igniter. selling Vulcan and Missle.
ftlgame,39cy8c,dryerlintcompelsyou,5,Thu Jun 11 02:24:28 2015 UTC,"Came to this interesting juncture and was curious what others would do here.  So far, I have been alternating between Halberd Beam and Vulcan in fights, depending on who I'm facing, but I knew I would have to choose between them eventually.  I just didn't realize it would be in this fashion.  How do you choose between Flak II, Halberd Beam, Chain Vulcan, and Weapon Pre-Igniter?  I've never beaten Hard with the Red-Tail, but this is my best run yet aided by truly blessed RNG.  Halberd Beam was a free drop in Sector 1 and Vulcan was a free drop in Sector 5, on top of completing the Zoltan Homeworlds to get the Zoltan Shield.  I've only lost one crew member so far and I've gotten both the critical defensive systems online (Cloaking/Drones)."
ftlgame,39cy8c,MrNoS,5,Wed Jun 10 22:48:55 2015 UTC,"Flak II + Beam + WPI is a godly combination. And Zoltan Shield on top of that? You've got a good shot at a damage-less run here (provided you don't  cheat with the Hull Repair Drone, I guess)..."
ftlgame,39cy8c,slowriderxcorps,2,Thu Jun 11 00:20:48 2015 UTC,"Sell the Vulcan and Hull Missile, buy Flak II and preigniter.  Use The Sven Maneuver (aka preigniter exploit) with extreme prejudice."
ftlgame,39cy8c,malboro_urchin,2,Thu Jun 11 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"You have two options here.  Flak II + Halberd Beam is all around excellent, but you need to watch out for getting Weapons hacked during the boss fight. In that case, shed the Vulcan and Basic Lasers to purchase the Flak II, then spend the rest on defensive upgrades. Two shields in Sector 6 is not really where you should be at. Fortunately, you have Defense I and Cloaking already in play, so you should be able to focus on your unkillability entirely for the rest of your upgrades.  Your other option is to use what you already have, as in, the Vulcan. In that case, drop the Halberd Beam and keep the two lasers, pumping all your scrap into defensive upgrades. Focus fire of all weapons upon the Engines of anything you're attacking to teach everyone the definition of having no mercy. You don't really need to worry about Weapon hacks too much either, especially once your defenses are set. Once the Vulcan gets spooled up, not even Hacking can stop it."
ftlgame,39cy8c,slowriderxcorps,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:49:06 2015 UTC,"Why Engines? Isn't it always better to target Piloting, which can have 3 bars max, zeroes evasion when hit enough, and delays FTL jumps?"
ftlgame,39cy8c,51Gunner,2,Thu Jun 11 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"Because Engines damage will reduce their Evasion by a greater amount than the helm (unless the Helm damage completely knocks it offline). Plus, as long as the Helm has any health, the enemy will have nearly all of their Evasion score to troll you, whereas if they barely repair Engines to one health, their Evasion will be terrible enough to where you can just wreck them again."
ftlgame,39cy8c,justintnelson,2,Thu Jun 11 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"You've got good kit for a turtle + Vulcan setup right now, and there's be no need to buy much right now. I'd sell off most of the spare kit and get a third shield. This leaves you an extra augment slot for something like an autoloader and some room on the weapons front for something like a breach or fire bomb.   The pre-igniter plus flak 2 plus halberd combo is pretty tempting though. It's hard to really go wrong in this situation- you're having a great run."
ftlgame,39cy8c,Elr3d,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"I can rule out the augments, drones, and crew right away. No use for them, except maybe the pre-igniter, but it doesn't do enough good right away to justify the cost.  Flak II plus Halberd is a very tempting combination. It might not be a bad idea to sell the other weapons and buy the flak. Once that's done, it'd be pretty tempting to go for the pre-igniter as well. But I'd have to balance that against the need to save scrap for two much-needed things: hull repairs and system upgrades -- especially a shields upgrade, and of course a weapons upgrade to power the new toys."
ftlgame,39cy8c,Fergusmo88,5,Wed Jun 10 23:27:14 2015 UTC,"I can rule out the augments, drones, and crew right away. No use for them, except maybe the pre-igniter, but it doesn't do enough good right away to justify the cost.   I disagree, it totally does in this case. Flak II + Halberd can kill in one volley (although perhaps not sector 6 ships on Hard), so with pre-igniter, most ship are one shot before they have a chance to hit anything. Or at the very least you severely incapacitate the enemy ship and work your way to an easy win.  Plus, if not on offense power, what else would he have to focus on right now? He has stealth, 2 shields, Zoltan shield, and a Defense I drone. I mean he could probably use a third bar of shield but it would only be a real priority over that godly weapon setup if shields and evasion were his only defense mechanisms."

ftlgame,39cy8c,Captain_Lord_Avalon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"Although flak + halberd sounds cool. I prefer vulcans because they are less RNG reliant than the former. One Vulcan alone is enough to win flagships if you turtle enough.  But you can't have both vulcan and halberd. So sell off the halberd if you plan on going vulcan.  Sell the LRS. Buy the pre-igniter. Sell system repair.  Power your vulcan and your hull missle. If you can afford it, max weapons to use the last laser. Otherwise, your mainly using your missile for the initial preignite shot and then swapping to your lasers.  I'd keep the hull repair for a bit longer. But you can sell it if you want.  If you didn't have such a stockpile of missiles, I would have also bought that flak II after selling the hull missile."
ftlgame,39cy8c,Lunaria-Stalis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"Sell the hull missile, buy the pre-igniter, aim to find hacking. Halberd + Vulcan is a combo alone that can win the game, the basic laser helps this out further. You already have drone control and stealth for defence, so that's not an issue.  While looking for hacking you can invest in more weapon power. (Since you'll want to max that out with this get-up.)  Good luck! And remember, the sven manoeuvre!"
ftlgame,39cy8c,Atamsih,3,Wed Jun 10 23:30:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Halberd + Vulcan is a poor combo, IMO; pick one or the other. Since the Vulcan is a chain weapon, the WPI doesn't help it out all that much. And it's still going to take some time to take down shields before the Halberd can go to work. Even with a Basic Laser, you're only talking two shots.  WPI + Halberd + Flak II would go much better together. And if you want to throw Hacking into the mix, then you also want weapons that are going to do a lot of damage in the brief period of time when shields are down. Maybe the Vulcan will eventually get there, but not for a while.  So sell the Vulcan and the missile - maybe even the System Repair Drone. Buy the Flak II, L6 Weapons (now that I think about it, you need to get both big weapons online ASAP) and drone parts. If you sell the Long Range Scanners maybe that gets you to WPI. But then you've got to get L6 Shields and more power."
ftlgame,39cy8c,TedTheViking,2,Thu Jun 11 05:56:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, you're right. I was just more concerned about the scrap costs, and I was too lazy to do the math in my head at the time."

ftlgame,39cy8c,Captain_Lord_Avalon,2,Thu Jun 11 10:20:10 2015 UTC,"It'll be more difficult in Hard, since the missile room is attached to the main compartment. You can't afford to turtle up when the flagship crew continuously repairs the missiles."
ftlgame,39cy8c,mekloz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:14:40 2015 UTC,I didn't know this. But yeah that will complicate things a bunch!
ftlgame,39cy8c,Captain_Lord_Avalon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:32:03 2015 UTC,"IMO if you use the Vulcan, your other weapons need to do some damage until the Vulcan gets going to finish the job. Playing on Hard, you can't afford to wait for the Vulcan to take Shields down. Cloaking only avoids some shots. And systems get targeted more."
ftlgame,39cy8c,mekloz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:18:03 2015 UTC,"With those defenses, though...  Fully cloak first at the start, second around the time zoltan shield goes down, you're already 50 second in with barely any damage."
ftlgame,39cy8c,TedTheViking,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"I wonder if you're assuming too much, but OTOH I don't know what level of difficulty this is, and how much scrap there is left to gain in ~2 sectors.  I figure at least 450 additional scrap is needed. That covers +8 power (which is kinda minimal - I'd like more and maybe the Backup Battery), L6 Shields, L8 Weapons, L3 Cloaking, and the two drone parts.  That leaves out L2 Doors, and buffers for O2, Piloting and Drone Ctrl. Also finding a store in sector 7 to buy drone parts for repairs, not to mention a final system. So that's around 580 scrap. (Well, less if you sell of the Long Range Scanners.)"

Just saying that if there are defenses in the game that are enough for it, this is what they are. I think OP has nearly anything you could have except maxing out the bars in the systems, hacking (semi-defensive) and another defense drone. Or can have with the WPI."
ftlgame,39cy8c,Lunaria-Stalis,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:31:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say go with Flak + Halberd and WPI.

OP needs burst damage over sustained damage, and Flak II + Halberd + WPI will give him that burst damage - not to mention the ability to cripple the missile launcher right off the bat."

Pike Beam + Fire Beam combo -- torch everything and damage multiple systems for maximum chaos. Fregatidae + Beams -- for those of you who are nervous to run out of drone parts.

I forget what ship I was using, maybe Slug B, but I just couldn't get a good weapon lineup going, so I focused on defense, used mind control to make the enemy fight, and then abducted them.   It's obviously not the most practical build, but it did have good rewards because of killing the crew instead of destroying ships. I made it to the flagship on hard mode but I lost in the end. Lanius B is the perfect ship for this build for this if you get sensors.  My personal favorite build was on Slug C when I found a fire beam and anti-bio beam. Combined with mind control and hacking it was absolutely brutal trapping some enemy crew in the shields room, starting a huge fire, hitting them with an anti-bio beam, and using mind control to make sure they couldn't put out the fires."

I ditched the Heal Bomb and bought Reconstructive Teleporter, then proceeded to never buy a medbay or clone bay for the rest of the game. It was really great flying a ship where your crew could only heal by boarding, and the lack of medbay meant that I could run boarding, cloaking, drones AND mind control, a system combination that rarely can be done. I remember getting high power weapons as well, so I was really powerful. The most intense fights were ones where I had to keep the enemy crew from dying for a while so that I could put more of my guys on the enemy ship to heal them up. It was great."

I even came across 2 back to back Slug Home Nebula sectors, and I found a store with a third one (also had Ion bomb for shield dropping). I didn't take it though, because it was sector 6, and I was in short supply of actually damaging weapons which is kinda required for the flagship, so at that very shop I sold the 2 Anti-Bio and got myself the Hull Laser 1 and Burst Laser next to the beam instead.

For extra fun and in pure Slug fashion, I also had a Fire Drone along with those 2 beams but I never got a chance to use everything at the same time. Since I got 2 Slug nebulae, my crew had 4 slugs in it thanks to slug recruiting events, and coincidentally, I also had a few zoltan, so I like to think it was a typical /u/dirtytabs ship with slug and zoltans hating on each other."

ftlgame,39d2zt,mekloz,4,Thu Jun 11 01:40:25 2015 UTC,"Ok, then. Just in case, I don't mean to sound harsh at any point, but you asked for the feedback, so, the most important stuff:  Learn to dance your crew. Twinge has a great video here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu6PGYBAOnA&index=9&list=PLGCAaPvQJtQIs8zDUss4zGuUKOJtC0HvT].  You can find more of these here [http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=26988].  Slow down and pay more attention: there was a bunch of situations where you could have done better had you taken some time: dealing with fire, managing your boarders and ship crew at the same time (pause more!), choosing your encounters (the zoltan ship that couldn't hurt you, you didn't even seem to check the second hazard, you want to know these things). You should have easily been able to avoid that engi's death if you'd only looked. Maybe it's just because you're talking on video, though, I don't know. Takes some of the focus away for sure.  Use your weapons. It's almost as if you're doing a challenge run or something. You can keep your weapon active and just switch the power to engines when you don't need it. Same with oxygen, switch the power when dealing with missile ships.  Some smaller stuff:  Don't start a fight without full health if you can help it.  Man the shield when facing heavy laser and mini beam.  Why exactly did you cut out selling the charger? Anyway, questionable decision, honestly, it's a very good weapon, a lot of potential. I would have sooner ditched the basic. That doesn't really work on a 3 slot ship at all. Early weapon bars are pretty cheap, too, 35 more scarp spent and you could have run those together (charger and burst I).  I see you mock the glorious warrior race. We'll see... weeww zeee!  A bit specific, but 'it seems dangerous, leave' will get you a fight anyways and unless you need drones that's a better option (I don't think it ever turns out differently, but I'm not entirely sure). I used to get caught in this all the time, so I learned the hard way."
ftlgame,39d2zt,Leylite,2,Thu Jun 11 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, That's a lot of good advice. I never knew how to do the crew juggling. I hope to use that for the rest of this run. Manning shields will definitely help save a couple hull points early on since that weapon configuration I see pretty frequently. I think you nailed it. I am going too fast and making way to many mistakes. Good eye. Thanks."
ftlgame,39d2zt,superfantastic1,3,Thu Jun 11 15:38:54 2015 UTC,"Your first couple of sectors seem fine - but you actually have a huge bomb surplus. You're allowed to use the small bomb on enemy weapons every now and then, you know. :)  Other than that, your clip show only covers the early game - you didn't really run into any nasty enemies like ones with shield drones, ones with doors, or ones with anti-personnel drones (all of which are still easy to deal with, but make things take longer). I'm also still interested in seeing your upgrade strategy for the middle game, which is where the difference between scrap efficiency and scrap inefficiency becomes clear."

Using small bomb to damage med/clone bay or weapon system. Losing the engi at the end was pretty bad but the game is still winnable

In hindsight I probably could have taken him on relatively safely if I was willing to use that, but to be honest I just didn't want to deal with hacked oxygen and solar flares at the same time. I was also feeling like it was starting to be a good idea to cut down on the number of battles where using at least 2 drone parts was likely to be necessary."
ftlgame,399dxf,ChummyCommie,3,Thu Jun 11 04:36:47 2015 UTC,"Why? You could've hacked shields using the drone depower exploit, taken down the overcharged shield with ion stunner/chain laser, and then beamed 5 rooms for 15 damage. Cloak the missile, destroy weapons by second volley."
ftlgame,399dxf,burning1rr,4,Wed Jun 10 06:27:45 2015 UTC,"That's a Halberd, not Glaive. Hitting 5 rooms only yield 10 hull points in damage. And I don't think OP know about the hacking exploit."
ftlgame,399dxf,Elr3d,11,Wed Jun 10 07:43:03 2015 UTC,Some people try to play FTL without using exploits.
ftlgame,399dxf,panda44444,3,Wed Jun 10 09:49:42 2015 UTC,"In his case he doesn't need the exploit anyway. It's a defense 2 drone, just fire your Ion stunner once and sneak the Hacking Drone when the Def 2 has targeted your shot? I think you can do that before the first layer of Zoltan shield is up. But whatever if you can't do it immediately, you definetely can on the second or third volley, by using the Halberd to drop the Zoltan shield."
ftlgame,399dxf,chewbacca77,8,Wed Jun 10 10:10:47 2015 UTC,"I am not so sure that the hack-depower-trick is an exploit. It requires some skill to do, and has even been acknowledged by a developer here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/26shbt/ae_harder_than_the_base_game/chui88e"
ftlgame,399dxf,ChummyCommie,5,Wed Jun 10 12:21:16 2015 UTC,"Yep! I was going to link to that exact comment myself.  If the developer is aware and happy that an unintended strategy is being used (and they haven't patched the game to fix it), its okay in my book."

ftlgame,399dxf,Leylite,3,Wed Jun 10 12:32:13 2015 UTC,Pausing is not a skill.
ftlgame,399dxf,Lunaria-Stalis,3,Wed Jun 10 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"It took me a lot of practice to perfect it, but now I can get past any number of drones on the first try (even Engi ships that have 4+ drones). Predicting where my drone will approach the enemy ship helps me get it there faster, and get it there without it getting destroyed. It may not seem like a big deal to get your hack on the enemy as fast as possible, but it has made a difference in the late game when my weapons officer is fully trained and the enemy has 3 or 4 shields (or if I have a weapon preignitor, then I want to have shields down right away so I can start killing them!) Also, you can't do the trick if the drone shoots directly at your hack. It has to shoot at it from an angle. These reasons make me believe that the trick isn't just about ""pausing"" and does require at least some skill and game knowledge to do it perfectly."
ftlgame,399dxf,Captain_Lord_Avalon,2,Wed Jun 10 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"It's not very hard to do against a single defense drone, but against a Defense Drone II it can be quite hard since the II version leads its shot a lot less and shoots a very fast laser - so you have to lure it into shooting when the drone itself is on the opposite side of the ship from the hacking drone, and the angle is steep enough that the laser won't hit anyway.  Sneaking a hacking drone past a mixture of defense I, II, and anti-drones is also still possible, but very difficult."
ftlgame,399dxf,MrBleah,2,Wed Jun 10 14:10:30 2015 UTC,"OP even has the defence drone though, so he should have been able to avoid pretty much all damage aside from the sun and the hacking."
ftlgame,399dxf,Abd_Kh66,2,Wed Jun 10 09:17:02 2015 UTC,"I suppose hypoxia causes bad decisions.  Oh, and what second volley? 15 damage would have killed the ship."

ftlgame,39akee,Lunaria-Stalis,5,Wed Jun 10 14:36:06 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. Once I can somewhat consistently beat the game (have to make sure I didn't just get lucky) I'll probably turn it on. Thanks for the advice!
ftlgame,39akee,chewbacca77,8,Wed Jun 10 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"You could turn it on whenever.. its a personal preference.  If you think that you'll get more enjoyment out of the game by leaving more things to be experienced later, leave AE content off for awhile."
ftlgame,39akee,malboro_urchin,3,Wed Jun 10 13:36:30 2015 UTC,Just unlock it once you're otherwise bored with the game.  Should revitalize things a little bit at least.  Overall though I think the original game was probably superior overall.
ftlgame,39akee,b4dr0b0t,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:39:26 2015 UTC,Overall though I think the original game was probably superior overall.   Why?
ftlgame,39akee,panda44444,2,Thu Jun 11 17:13:49 2015 UTC,"I think the original mix of weapons and ship systems just made for better game play.  A lot of the new weapons, such as the ones that shoot increasingly faster after the last shot are really just sluggish/bad weapon choices.  Meanwhile the flak gun is ridiculously strong and if you find one early it makes the game absurdly easy.  Basically adding in more polarized in strength weapon systems added a whole bunch of variance to an already high variance game.  It used to be before that most weapon systems were more mid range and the game's difficulty wasn't arbitrarily changed too significantly by what weapons you found (unless you found mark 2 bursts).  Hacking, once you get good at using it, makes the game way too easy.  It becomes the go to choice for a much easier victory in pretty much any game you play."
ftlgame,39akee,malboro_urchin,2,Thu Jun 11 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"i waited about 70 hours of gameplay before I tried the advanced edition content. I had all the A & B type ships unlocked except for the crystal cruiser (ugh Stealth B victory took me waaaaay too long).  in some respects it makes the game easier, but maybe more challenging if you're struggling to beat the Flagship consistently."
ftlgame,39akee,ChummyCommie,2,Wed Jun 10 19:41:19 2015 UTC,"I played my first 100 hours on easy with AE disabled, winning at least once with every ship (type A and B). My opinion is no, don't play without AE enabled. I felt that so many things were different and that it would have been better if I was exposed to all the elements from the start. And from what I've read, some of the changes made in the AE update still affect the game with AE disabled too, and if this is the case, you aren't really getting the ""original FTL experience"" anyways."
ftlgame,39akee,eriktheguy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:52:58 2015 UTC,"some of the changes made in the AE update still affect the game with AE disabled too   I think most, if not all, of these types of changes were QoL things, like being able to save your crew's positions and send them back to their saved places with a button press."
ftlgame,39akee,malboro_urchin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"There are some changes that directly affect the gameplay, such as door and sensor manning, enemy boarding AI (they now try to board you twice instead of once like pre-AE). The cost of many weapons, drone and systems were also changed as well."
ftlgame,39akee,Motorsagmannen,2,Thu Jun 11 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"Do a few runs without, then enable. It's better."
ftlgame,39akee,slowbro17,2,Thu Jun 11 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"I decided to 'unlock' AE for myself after beating the game (Normal) a few times. I wanted to experience and become comfortable with FTL without AE, before altering the experience with AE content.  AE offers a lot of variety, new weapons, new systems, and I think it's definitely worth exploring FTL with and without hacking AE. AE really diversifies and alters your potential choices and even overall strategies, which is why I personally enjoyed delaying my exposure to AE content, and it sounds like you might enjoy the same thing.  Ultimately it's personal preference. If you're comfortable enough with the base game to the point where you'd like more options, or if you like having all of AE's additions thrown at you from the outset, then it's a good time to turn on AE."
ftlgame,39akee,Motorsagmannen,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"the way you unlock ships is different as well, if i remember correctly you can unlock the next ship in line with AE through victories, and not just from the quests. if this is good or bad is up to you though. only exception is the federation cruiser, (which actually gets a quest unlock in AE) but you should have that already if you beat the game anyway."
ftlgame,39akee,itsamamaluigi,5,Wed Jun 10 16:05:48 2015 UTC,I believe this is how it works in both modes after the update

ftlgame,39akee,KamiForever,3,Wed Jun 10 16:53:52 2015 UTC,The only ships that you need AE enabled to unlock are the C-type layouts (reach sector 8 with the B layout and AE enabled). Victory unlocks count regardless of whether AE is on or off.
ftlgame,39akee,Mario-C,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"If you have to ask... do it! Advanced Edition content doesn't necessarily make the game harder.

In my haste, I didn't realize that it would still jump even when I was fighting. Thus, I had to break through the Zoltan shield again, while still dealing with the boarders.  From there, it simply out-DPS'd me at the end. I was only using the defense drone - the rest of the power was elsewhere, I only upgraded it with leftover scrap to prevent losing the drone. Now that I look at the picture, I realize my hacking would probably have saved me.  Fortunately, the previous sector was a Rebel Stronghold, so I still got the Federation Cruiser."
