The gal is so overrated as a dealmaker and politician and her ""courageous"" stance on the Flag.  If she was like 6th generation whose great grand pappy was some general or something then it's clear that her position on the flag took some real guts.   So as a psuedo-southerner she exhibited maybe just ""a bit"" of political courage. As a Republican, however, she's exhibits zero political courage. I'm talking about the ease of purchasing a gun.  I hate the fucking government-- I hate the postal service, the DMV, etc. I think a successful life well lived as an American is one where you have minimum # of collisions with either the government or the legal system. (A PERFECT life would be zero interaction.) But the government with all its inherent inefficiencies and pains in the ass processes should be inflicted on the gun purchase process.  I'm also not against guns at all but I feel like it should be even more of a pain in the ass to buy a gun than it already is. It should be a HASSLE to purchase a gun anywhere (and the gov't knows better than anyone how to make a hassle/convoluted process.) A ""dream"" would be you'd have to get an original form signed in person and you could ONLY fax it to a department and then wait ""2 or 3"" weeks for an approval.  It's too easy for a crank or a hothead to buy a gun. If you really want to shoot guns then join the fucking Marine Corps OR go through a more involved process. If you really want it you can get it but it shouldn't be painless and it shouldn't be easy."

southcarolina,3d2yov,ryan_m,-5,Mon Jul 13 03:49:34 2015 UTC,Don't mean to nitpick but the purchasing of a weapon isn't the constitutional right.  The purchase process (where these devices aren't made by a local gunsmith but now unimaginably huge companies with stores that have an arsenal on offering) can be subject to additional scrutiny.  The kid didn't steal a gun he bought one. It wouldn't have stopped him if he went ahead and stole one but shit it's harder to steal a gun than to buy one. That avenue should be cut off. Hopefully the little prick learns what happens when you try to steal from a gun-owner. Boom.

southcarolina,3d2yov,rorytmeadows10,-5,Mon Jul 13 05:57:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I fully aware that there are dark, evil rotten pieces of garbage in the world. I also know that there are people with mental and impulse control issues.  I'm very pragmatic-minded and am no pollyanna.   To be clear, I'm not saying to take away anybody's guns. I want to increase the risks that unhinged people need to expose themselves to in the planning/orchestration stages of these attacks. You can do that by making it difficult to acquire a weapon by legal means.  It should be very, very hard to acquire a gun by legal means and consequently very, very risky to get acquire a gun by illegal means.  Again I'm just trying to think pragmatically about this. I readily concede that what I'm talking about isn't a panacea by any stretch but to quite literally do nothing is unacceptable.  Think of it like profit for a business.  Profit = REVENUE - COST  How to make profit big? Well you wanna make revenue really goddamned big and cost really teeny-tiny small right? If you can wring out a few extra savings from costs you'll do it. If you can incrementally make revenue a little bit bigger without adjusting costs by the same amount then you do it b/c every little bit counts and adds up. You gotta work both the revenue and costs side and only working one to the exclusion to the other isn't a recipe for success.  So hit mental illness. Hit the lack of responsibility some people seem to think they don't owe to others (ie rat out a friend who seems like they're planning an attack.) Hit the easy ""low hanging fruit"" availability of guns. Hit the lack of armed guards in large gathering spaces. Hit every angle of this thing with the singular goal of reducing the probability of one of these attacks inflicting mass casulties and causing untold suffering for those injured and their families.  There's no silver bullet here, you need silver buckshot. All I'm saying is that the 'Guv isn't demonstrating political courage on this. She won't even broach the subject when to comes to guns. That's not good."

The background check failed here, because he had a drug conviction and shouldn't have been able to purchase one.   That avenue should be cut off   How do you plan on doing that?

southcarolina,3cstnh,powercow,6,Fri Jul 10 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the chanting and shouting was obnoxious, but I suspect the governor wanted it that way. She wanted to put herself in front of that crowd, gladhanding black leaders and pretending like she had been for its removal all along instead of whenever it was politically popular. Never miss an opportunity to pander. Even when you're in a state that would elect a ham sandwich if it ran as a Republican, there are plenty of GOP members willing to make a swipe at your crown."

I was on the side of keeping it next to the monument however the flag is a historical thing and deserved the respect of silence. I feel that the supporters of the flag coming down could have respected the feelings of the people who wanted it to stay.   The flag means different things for different people. For me it didn't mean hatred it all but I respect it because it is a part of South Carolina history.   I am so proud of South Carolina for not rioting and causing huge scenes. For once we were in the spotlight for the issue at hand and not because of rioting, looting, and other crazy things."

THE MOTIVE.. was racism.  If i shoot you and happen to take out a tumor before it gets out of control, that doesnt make me a surgeon, even if the results are the same. My intent was to kill. That might have been a historical artifact, but it was abused by bigots who raised that flag in bigotry. Doesnt matter the bullet took out the cancer.. doesnt make bullets a cure or the shooter a doctor and same with the flag.  The intent, the motivation, wasnt historic, it was bigoted."

southcarolina,3cstnh,ispeelmydrink,9,Fri Jul 10 19:58:13 2015 UTC,"yeah sorry you cry history all you want, but you cant ignore the parts you dont like. It was put up specifically for racist reasons. you might have a point, if the south constantly tried to honor the confederacy and people constantly tried to stop them. But it wasnt.. it was put up to fight segregation.   What you should be pissed at, is that people took a piece of your revered history and besmirched it with racism. Yall should be pissed that it was so abused by the klan and others, specifically to tell black people ""THIS AINT YOUR LAND AND DONT GET UPPIDY'. dont be mad at those offended by it now.. when it was totally used for offensive reasons AND NOT AT ALL.. NOT IN ONE IOTA was that put there for any honoring of the civil war or the people who died in it. Not in the least."

southcarolina,3cstnh,ispeelmydrink,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:18:37 2015 UTC,"Actually, breaking down the ""they"" in ""They put the flag up in 1962"" is kind of interesting.  The head of the Centennial Committee thought the flag was just going up for the duration of the Centennial, purely for reasons of historical commemoration, but he forgot to insert any language about taking it down and, in his words, they ""kind of forgot about it.""   The person on the committee who had the idea of putting it up was Johnny Mays, described as a ""professional Southerner"" and he definitely wanted it up there as a symbol of pushback against the civil rights movement.   The people on the committee who voted to put it up were a mix of UDC women and history buffs and their reasons ran the spectrum between Dr. Hollis's ""it's history for the centennial"" and Johnny Mays's ""you can't tell us what to do.""  Who says one person can't impact history?!"

southcarolina,3cstnh,TossThisAccount12,14,Fri Jul 10 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"from his comment history.. which is a bit full of jizz.   What the fuck are you talking about. Black people are way more racist per capita against white people than white people against blacks. Its just so widely accepted as part of their culture nobody questions it, because if a white person questions some aspect of black culture that doesn't jive well with ""polite soceity"" its racist.   I think we know what specific group he is talking about. This guy is the same as dylann. A divider and ignorant.  If you look at the actual facts.. Black people are slightly less racist against whites than whites are against blacks.  if you look 47% of african americans harbor anti white views, while 59% of white people have anti black views.   you just wont read this on the council of concerned conservative citizens website.  sorry toss, but your part of the problem that SC needs to recover from.. does there need to be recovery on both sides? fuck yeah, but you sir need some self reflection."

In what later became known as the Cornerstone Speech, C.S. Vice President Alexander Stephens declared that the ""cornerstone"" of the new government ""rest[ed] upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery—subordination to the superior race—is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth"". After the war, however, Stephens made efforts to qualify his remarks, claiming they were extemporaneous, metaphorical, and intended to refer to public sentiment rather than ""the principles of the new Government on this subject.""
