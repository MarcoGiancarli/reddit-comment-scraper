bleachshirts,3e2u2j,noribun,2,Tue Jul 21 19:48:14 2015 UTC,"I kicked it, and this is from the last newsletter (about a month ago):   Hey everybody, We are very, very sorry there hasn’t been an update in a while. Natasha and her team have been working away on finishing the last episodes. Episode 5 “Dadbox” is completely done and episode 6 “Video Game” is almost done. Storyboards and designs are almost finished for episodes 7-10. So, of the nine, six minute episodes funded with your generous support, four are complete and available for viewing, two are pretty much done, and three are almost ready to be animated. Frederator is contributing the funding for a 10th episode to round this season to a full, one hour of Bee and PuppyCat. We do not have an announcement for when the rest of the Bee and PuppyCat episodes will be available to watch. Significant production delays means that we can’t say yet when the rest of the Kickstarted episodes will come out. As you may know, all of our work is done by hand. We work with small crews and Natasha has precise specifications. Sometimes this means that the literal designing and drawing takes much longer than you can imagine. As soon as we know, we will let you know first."

bleachshirts,3dw4bl,CobraFive,13,Mon Jul 20 00:52:19 2015 UTC,"If you can keep the bleach mist very fine, and you use good quality shirts (e.g. 6oz cotton rather than really thin stuff), it's possible to just bleach the outside, and leave the inside almost un-bleached.  You spray just enough to get the outside damp, but not so much that the inside gets wet too.  That should help.  That said, I've never bleached anything to white.  It's possible that bleaching just the outside means you'd still see some of the original color underneath."

bleachshirts,3dw4bl,Onlyhereforthelaughs,6,Tue Jul 21 01:18:17 2015 UTC,"Yikes, is that straight bleach?! O_O  Tips I have are:   Fresh bleach. I learned on this sub that bleach older than 6 months can lose effectiveness. Iron the shirt while bleaching it. This is a great way to make the bleach much lighter, while still using the 50/50 mix. Expect a buildup on the iron, though. Little flecks of paper from the stencil, and the chlorine from the bleach. When the iron has cooled off, you should be able to wipe away the buildup with a wet cloth. The riskiest tip I have is washing the shirt in hot water after you bleach it. The one time I did this, the shirt wet VERY bright, which was not what I wanted for that design at all, as it blended all the layers I had done into one faded image."
bleachshirts,3dw4bl,Onlyhereforthelaughs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:00:08 2015 UTC,"I will try a bunch of these tips. Also:  After spraying bleach on the shirt, how long do you wait before either washing it out, or doing a second spray?"
bleachshirts,3dw4bl,Onlyhereforthelaughs,3,Mon Jul 20 05:13:35 2015 UTC,"Typically I dab up excess right away after the first spray, and then I spray and iron, spray and iron, spray and iron until it's the lightness I want.  Once the color I want has been reached, I dunk the thing in cold water."
bleachshirts,3dw4bl,demonqueen21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:00:04 2015 UTC,This is what I did. How long do you wait between sprays?
bleachshirts,3dw4bl,demonqueen21,4,Mon Jul 20 14:56:54 2015 UTC,"Not long. Basically as soon as I'm done ironing the first one. Sometimes I've got the bottle in one hand, and the iron in the other. (That sounds like something a domestic abuser would say in confession...)  When it starts looking really dry, I might do a spray and let it sit for a little bit, just to breathe some life back into it so it isn't bone dry."
bleachshirts,3dw4bl,Sibraxlis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:27 2015 UTC,"Weird, this is exactly what I did on this shirt. Spray, iron, spray, iron..."

bleachshirts,3dw4bl,SoManyPancakes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:13 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice though! I am trying again tonight. I have a new spray bottle. I think I was just spraying too much.
bleachshirts,3dw4bl,StirlADrei,4,Tue Jul 21 01:19:07 2015 UTC,"I've never had this problem before and I bleach mine white a lot. Use the thicker cotton shirts rather than those thin ones and use 40/60 bleach to water. You'll have to let it sit a bit longer or even spray another time to get it white, but it should help with not eating through the fabric"
bleachshirts,3dw4bl,Bamres,3,Mon Jul 20 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"how long does it normally take for the bleach to work, in your experience? How long should I wait before spraying a second time?"
bleachshirts,3dw4bl,Bamres,6,Mon Jul 20 04:03:16 2015 UTC,With the weaker solution on the thick shirts usually only 10-15ish minutes. I usually spray it outside and then go in and fill up the bathtub with water and come back to wash it and it'll be done. But if after 25-30 it's not as white as you want then I spray it again and give it another 15min.

bleachshirts,3djei3,cowflu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:20:53 2015 UTC,"Logo was made using an overhead sheet + spray adhesive, words with a soft plastic film.  This stuff (German site).  It has the same consistency as screen protectors for your phone.  Smells a bit like new car.    I had hoped the words would turn out brighter, but I could only iron it once since I had to remove the stencil first.  They also bled a bit, likely from leaving the bleach on too long or using too many sprays.  Perhaps both.  There are also some imperfections in the main logo.  I'm not sure why it bled on those two corners.  I'm guessing my shirt may have been a little wet? Or maybe it was because I let the glue sit too long before attaching the stencil to the shirt.  I normally spray the glue then immediately stick the stencil to the fabric, but the spray can says I can also wait 20 minutes before joining the two pieces so I decided to try that.  I feel more confident with immediately sticking the two together.  In any case, I'll wait until I have freezer paper to do a second version.  The d-c-fix isn't very good for cutting text.  The film comes on the standard waxy paper, so it sometimes bunched up under my blade when I was trying to do more detailed work like the inside of a B.  The film is pretty good for less detailed logos.  It's easier to cut than overhead sheets, and self-adhesive so it's simpler to apply than sheets or freezer paper.  The adhesive seems a bit weaker though, so I suspect it may be easier to over-spray with your bleach.  The logo and slogan are from the Advent Administration, the antagonists in XCOM 2 (coming this fall to PC!)."

What if the process gets messed up, will you cover the cost of the replacement shirt? With new shirts, that can be a profit nightmare.  My typical price is $20, including shipping. ($25 for international)  I use thrift store shirts so that they only cost me $2 apiece. Then if I mess one up, I can easily replace it out of my profits. (This also buys me time to hunt for the shirt, so buyers know it's not going to show up overnight. It takes time.) The shirts are still in great condition, and as long as it looks good, most won't care what brand it is. (But colors may bleach differently since you're not working with the same brand all the time)  I started out at the $15 price point, but even with all my friends buying shirts, I was barely breaking even, and had a lot of time sunk into it. So as my skill increased, I decided to up my price. No one has made complaints about the price, and they still seem eager to pounce on it before I change my mind. Makes me think I could get even more if I asked, but I'm happy with $20 for now.  Hope this helps. :)"

For the mix, I usually do the 50/50, and then I throw in a splash of extra bleach just to tip it in that direction.  Not sure what kind of spray bottle you use, but one of the fine mist pump types from the toiletries section work really well! Right now I'm using an old eyeglass cleaning solution bottle. High capacity, but fine mist.  For an extra hit of bright, (Though you noted that wasn't a priority) I usually go over my moist designs with a hot iron. Be very sure to dab up what excess you can beforehand, or it will super steam that bleach into a big bleed.  I can't help much with the cutting of the stencil unless you know somebody crafty that makes their own greeting cards. They might have a Cricut Explore or Silhouette Cameo where you could upload the design and have the machine cut for you. They're pricy machines, but a good investment if you plan to bleach a lot of shirts. (If you have more questions about that subject I would be glad to share what I know)"

I've been going around a 50/50 mix with one of those little eyeglass cleaner bottles, so it's comforting to know I'm going the right direction. I think I'll probably end up spraying closer than I have been so that the mist can get into all the little spaces of the design. The idea of the iron scares me  As for the stencil, I think that I've got that somewhat under control. A beer or two, and a lot of calming music has put me in the zone. Here's what I've got cut out so far. I'm gonna wait to do the rest till I actually do the shirt because of all of the spare pieces I'm gonna need to keep track of"

bleachshirts,3dbrx3,Juodaan_Viinaa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:57:45 2015 UTC,"A small tip that I can give you is this: when you spray the bleach, do it outdoors and on a sunny day. That makes the bleach dry faster and lets you to apply the solution many more times. Also, it allows you to use the wind in your favour: some spray bottles shoot big drops of solution in the middle of the fine mist, but if there is just a bit of wind, you can manage to spray in a certain place where the wind will guide the mist towards the shirt, but since the big drops are heavier, they will stay away from it.  And that's about it. Good luck!"

bleachshirts,3d9hu1,Onlyhereforthelaughs,4,Tue Jul 14 15:32:24 2015 UTC,"I sell my shirts and hoodies in my university. I advertise them mostly through facebook (I created a page for my ""brand"") and by word (i.e. I tell my friends, they tell their friends, etc.).   Since I am very young and don't really need it, I keep it just as side income, which in expense means that I don't make a big lot of money. If you want the numbers I can tell you that, if I advertise heavily on a particular week and then work hard to finish everything, I can make 50 to 60 dollars a week, but I can only do that when I'm on holidays from school, so there's that. Usually, after every advertisement that I place on a particular Facebook group, around 2 to 4 people ask me for a product (some ask for a single shirt, some ask for many; some people have even asked me for 5 different shirts).  Now, starting up was very easy. After I had a few finished shirts, I created a Facebook page showing all the finished designs. I also added an album with different possible images that could be bleached into the shirts (the stencils). Then I just started advertising on different Facebook groups. Every time I finish a design, I make sure to add a photo of it to the album on my page to let people know what kind of results they can expect from me.  I believe that you could make it your full time job only if you either work tirelessly or you find a quick way to cut the stencils.   A tip that I can give you is that if you are planning on making many shirts with the same design, you should not use freezer paper. In those cases, I make my stencils out of acetate so I can use them many times. Also, I have some promotions (I don't know if that's the right word) to boost the sales a bit. For example, if someone buys 4 different shirts, I give them the 5th for free; or if someone asks for many shirts with the same design, I give them a special discount (as I don't have to cut the stencil all over again).  Just as a final note, don't be afraid to be a little expensive. You are not only charging for the materials, you are charging for your time (and I know how much time making a single shirt can consume). Good luck!"
bleachshirts,3d9hu1,Juodaan_Viinaa,2,Tue Jul 14 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"I have a very quick way to cut stencils. The Cricut Explore. :D  I'm not sure the acetate would work for me, as I like to iron my designs during the bleaching process for better contrast. I haven't worked with acetate before, but I would guess it is heat sensitive if it's a plastic.  I wanted to ask what your pricing was if you only make 50-60 a week if you get everything done. How many shirts would that be?  I also have a Facebook page, and have so far just been selling to coworkers and friends mostly, but I have a few that come through Reddit and Etsy as well when I crosspost my shirts. So far my pricing has been $20 per shirt, and that includes the shipping inside the US. I usually tack on another $5 for international shipping.  Since I buy my shirts second-hand, (Still in great shape, but they are thrifted) I only spend 2-3 bucks per shirt, and then the minimal cost of freezer paper and bleach.  The Cricut Explore is a good investment for making a lot of repeatable freezer paper stencils. You get to upload your own designs, and it cuts them out at whatever size you want. I've already made my money back on that investment. :)  So far I haven't done much in the way of advertising short of word of mouth, but I'm thinking of spreading out. I plan to enter my county fair, so I can get some more visibility there, and then maybe put a few flyers on the free corkboards around town.  The latest thing I did was take a bunch of my older shirts, pin my card to them, and then donated them to the various thrift stores around town. Maybe somebody will find me that way. :)"
bleachshirts,3d9hu1,Juodaan_Viinaa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:00:08 2015 UTC,"The Cricut Explore is an incredible advantage! It must save you so much time, but I see a problem: usually, my designs are bigger than a paper sheet, so I believe I could not use the Cricut Explore. What is its maximum allowed size?  Commonly I sell my shirts for 10 to 13 dollars (but I sell them in pesos, so that's around 150 mexican pesos). That means that I must sell 5 or 6 shirts a week to earn around 60 dollars. I buy the shirts directly from the factory, so they cost me less than 2 dollars each. Nevertheless, maybe I am the one who should charge more for his shirts!  You really made me consider buying a Cricut. I'm tired of spending hours cutting every little detail. Can you use any picture that you desire or are there limitations? I mean, assuming that the picture is suitable for making a stencil.  Also, I'll try to advertise myself giving out cards around my university.  I was trying to give advice and now I'm the one asking for it. Isn't this neat?"
bleachshirts,3d9hu1,yorrellew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:52:46 2015 UTC,"Maximum size (With largest cutting mat) is about 11""x23"", but you can split the design to multiple cuts and just include overlap so you can iron them together.  Example 1: This one was both too tall and too wide, so I just made the horn a separate piece. Can't tell from the result, though.  Example 2: Since this one is wider than 12"" on any side, I did it in halves, but again it isn't evident in the result.  So far I've been very happy with the Cricut, the lines on Discord are pretty tiny, and it cut them no problem. Text is also amazingly easy.  If you can use Paint, or any other photo editor, I would say a Cricut is a great idea. .PNGs work best, because they have the option to be backgroundless, which makes for the best stencils, but .JPGs also work because the Cricut allows you to negate colors in the stencil, like a white background.  As long as you limit the stencil to two colors (White and black) the Cricut should have no problem making a stencil out of it. You can actually go on their website and find the Cricut Design Space, and try it out, make a few stencils. You won't be able to cut without the machine, but you can make sure your designs will work. :)  Sharing info is always neat, that's what I wanted. :D"

Bit of bleeding in the waves, and where the shirt changes height to the pocket, but the bleaching itself is very uniform, and not blotchy.  For your first serious attempt, I'd rate it a 7.5/10. Room for improvement, but definitely not bad."
bleachshirts,3d2yv1,Onlyhereforthelaughs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:46:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! The shirt actually wasn't fully dry when the picture was taken (neighbors were using my building's dryer). Now that it's dry there's also a bit of bleeding up in the sails as well, but I don't mind--I think it suits the look to have some raggedy edges.   I think that (besides the pocket) the culprit behind a lot of the bleeding was that I used a heat gun instead of an iron to stick the paper to the shirt. It worked well enough, but I had some trouble with the stencil lifting. The upshot though was that I had to do some emergency surgery on the stencil while cutting, and the heat gun was perfect for that."
bleachshirts,3d2yv1,ShelfordPrefect,2,Mon Jul 13 23:47:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm, how did you store it while waiting to wash/dry it?   I usually throw mine in a big bucket of water to make the bleach too weak to continue working. Definitely cold water. Hot water will cause it to get brighter.  I've never used a heat gun during my bleaching. Thrift store iron gives me plenty of heat and good contact. Want to try and find one without the steam holes though, they can catch on tiny pieces of stencil."

bleachshirts,3d39x5,striderchris,3,Mon Jul 13 04:52:14 2015 UTC,Huh  They've only gone through the wash after bleaching so I guess we'll see if I've messed everything up XP
bleachshirts,3d39x5,Jbozzarelli,2,Mon Jul 13 06:35:52 2015 UTC,"You know how your skin feels slimy when you get it on your fingers and rub them together?  Bleach isn't really slimy.  That's your skin cells sloughing off and rubbing between your fingers.  If it will do that to human skin, imagine what it will do to cotton fibers.  Bleach is caustic.  It is Chlorine + Lye. It can disintegrate cotton if given time and a strong enough solution.    Source:  Accidentally dissolved a hand towel one time."
bleachshirts,3d39x5,scotomaniac,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:53:57 2015 UTC,"Will it do it over time even after its washed off or will it continue to destroy the fibers? In other words, is it just easier to completely destroy a shirt while bleaching it if you don't dilute it or is it more than just that?"
bleachshirts,3d39x5,yorrellew,2,Mon Jul 13 14:55:55 2015 UTC,"Based on what I've seen on Clorox's website, once the shirt has been thoroughly rinsed, all the bleach should be gone.  I think the concern is just that you'll weaken the fibers during the bleaching."

bleachshirts,3cxeux,Pneut,7,Sat Jul 11 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"My hoodies are usually 50% polyester and 50% cotton. Bleaching them is actually quite easy in my experience. They usually take a lot more sprays than a shirt to start whitening, but that gives you a certain margin of error. Also, since they are much thicker than a shirt, there is little to no risk for the bleach to bleed through it and stain the other side of the fabric."

The plus is they don't cost very much, and they're prewashed, so you get to skip that step.  50/50 Edit: BLEACH/WATER MIX is fine. I've always used 100% Cotton hoodies.  A lot of my coworkers wanted hoodies instead of shirts, and if I messed one up, the price was catastrophic to my profits. I really like shirts instead because thrift stores have them in abundance, and I can usually get them for $2."

bleachshirts,3cdk7v,Trekkie_girl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, I bought it solely for bleach shirt stencils. I knew I wanted text and quotes from the get-go, and people said to avoid them. But I found a way.  It looks like the Cricut Explore itself is now outdated, and is surpassed by two new models. I'll cover them later down this comment.  I do still have to place all the tiny pieces, but it sure beats cutting them out myself in the first place. The sticky mat is great for keeping them in place so I don't lose them. Standard grip is pretty tacky at first, but does lessen to a useable degree after a few uses. Mats do lose their stick if not cared for. Always put the clear cover back on when not in use. But they're cheap, so don't worry about them too much. :P  If you only cut freezer paper, blades last forever, like, I'm on my second blade, and I've been bleaching for almost a year now. (10 months)  I highly recommend Cricut Explore if you are going to get a Cricut. (There's also Silhouette, but I've never used one, and can't review it.) Explore is the only one that will allow you to upload your own designs, which is essential to our hobby. While old Cricut Explores are still available, there are newer models available for the same price or cheaper.  Cricut Explore One is basically the same machine, but cheaper. It connects via USB, and you upload your designs to make stencils. Price on Cricut's website is $199.99.  Cricut Explore Air is the same machine, but light blue, and with Bluetooth wireless connection built in. Whether the extra $50 is worth it to you is up to you. They do sell wireless adapters for less than that. Cricut Explore Air is available on Cricut's website for $249.99.  Just by cost I would go with the Cricut Explore One. It's cheap, and will do the job just fine. Yes you have to be wired, but you'd want to be near it anyway, right?  Important note: Other Cricuts will NOT let you upload your own designs. I tried to cheap out and get a Mini. It didn't work, and I lost a good chunk of money on that. That's why I've been bolding the word Explore everywhere.  If you plan to make a lot of shirts, I think a Cricut is a solid investment. You can also use it to make greeting cards or whatever. I don't. I do make little odd projects with the vinyl and window cling stuff, but mostly that thing cuts freezer paper.  If you have any questions, just ask. I'm happy to help however I can. :)"

When I used the citric acid (which you can generally find in canning supplies sections of grocery stores),  I used a tablespoon or so to a bucket of water, and then had another bucket of regular water...and then into the wash.  I have not had any problems with my shirts wearing down.  But that might have been the case without neutralizer, but after all the effort by that point, I figure might as well have some insurance.

I tried one shirt so far and it didn't turn out so hot. I made the stencil from canvas I had printed (I work in a print shop but not one with a screen printing machine or I would make a shirt that way) and cut out with an exacto knife. The image came out fuzzy, no where near the definition of the shirt in this image.    I used a spray bottle with 50% water 50% bleach. I was about 6 inches from the shirt. I let it set for 60 seconds after I sprayed it, and I used a 100% cotton shirt. I can't think of any other details to list.  Is this enough info for theories  on why I messed up?"

Not easy with cardboard stencils, but with freezer paper it's really easy.  To hide minimal errors, consider throwing speckles of bleach over the whole thing. Gives stuff a cosmic look. Bigger blotches make, well, bigger blotches.   Risky tip: For a bright, and as far as I can tell, unpredictable result, wash the shirts in hot water, rather than cold. Makes the bleach spots crazy bright."

bleachshirts,3bmowp,AverageFatGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:39:56 2015 UTC,"I've found that red shirts take time. Lots of time.

bleachshirts,3bmowp,stonefry,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:42:36 2015 UTC,Some shirts are better than others. Some won't dye at all. Some will dye immediately when the bleach hits them. Raise or lower your concentration of bleach to water accordingly. Don't get discouraged. Many light coats will get it as bright as it can get without bleeding. Be patient.

The heavier cotton holds up well, and doesn't get soaked instantly if you live somewhere hot.  The Champion ones have an embroidered logo on one sleeve, which I like, but some people say makes the items look less home-made.  American Apparel shirts I've seen have all been very thin junk.  As for where to get them, I bought a couple batches from the site I linked above.

bleachshirts,3bi90g,theotherkevinsmith,3,Mon Jun 29 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"Do you have a swimming pool supply store in your area? They typically sell chlorine for pool maintenance. Whereas chlorine bleach is anywhere from 6-9% sodium hyperchlorite, typically on the lower end. Here in the U.S., I can buy a gallon of liquid chlorine at my local pool supply store for around $4(U.S.) and it is the same thing as household bleach, just a stronger concentration of sodium hyperchlorite (which is the active bleaching ingredient) - usually between 10-15%.  My last home had an unground pool that I had to maintain and I accidentally splashed some of the liquid on my shirt when I was pouring it into the pool. It bleached it out pretty darn quick.

Of course the first thing I did was check if my local supermarket has something useful. They have nothing (and it's a big store). They do have bleach related stuff in the cleaning products section (bathroom and kitchen cleaning, not clothes), but I'm pretty sure none of these are usable because they also contain soap and other agents and I assume they are too weak anyway.

bleachshirts,3b7ldb,ZeroCix,8,Fri Jun 26 16:46:40 2015 UTC,how did you make sure the fine line details around the joints were preserved?
bleachshirts,3b7ldb,Gabbiani,3,Fri Jun 26 18:12:35 2015 UTC,I traced out the design using a Sharpie fine point marker. That gave me slightly thicker lines to cut around.

bleachshirts,3ba2ye,MonsterOasis,3,Sat Jun 27 05:51:52 2015 UTC,I found a pack of plastic stencil sheets at a craft store (a.c.moore) that I've been using for my designs. Using a spray adhesive it creates a solid seal when you give it a good smoothing over. They sometimes leave a bit of residue (but that comes off after a wash or two). The stencils stay pretty well intact after peeling them off and you can just spray the adhesive again to reapply on another shirt
bleachshirts,3ba2ye,schimmschamm,3,Sat Jun 27 18:27:08 2015 UTC,Duralar
bleachshirts,3ba2ye,IncrediblyEasy,2,Mon Jun 29 00:13:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe use non-permanent spray adhesive? It sort of is intended for that, although I believe it would lose stickiness fast due to lint."

There's a waxy material you can make stencils out of that gets a pretty solid seal, but I cannot for the life of me remember what it's called.

bleachshirts,3ba2ye,thesk8rguitarist,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:39:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely duralar. I've got a vinyl cutter machine and when you put in duralar it doesn't cut all the way through, but cuts the design perfectly for you to finish cutting out. Then use some spray glue (NOT TOO MUCH or the glue will clump on the shirt and be very hard to remove). Attach your stencil to the shirt. I keep all pieces so it's easier to place holes (like the middle of an ""O""). It's easy to do layers with duralar too. once you're done, apply making tape to the back of the duralar and carefully remove. This will take away quite a bit of glue making your design usable again. I've used the same design around 4 times. I keep track of all the small pieces by sticking them all to 's piece of tape, then applying the tape to the big sheet stencil.   Another tip if using a vinyl cutter is to add ""+"" and a few ""L""s in different directions to ensure your stencil is placed properly."

bleachshirts,39za35,Autoboat,5,Tue Jun 16 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"You probably sprayed too much, too quickly.  If there's too much water+bleach, it will wick along the shirt fibers, or be squeezed along them when you dab / blot the shirt with a paper towel.  Spray just a little, wait for it to evaporate (or iron it), repeat."

bleachshirts,39za35,this_guy_over_here_,3,Thu Jun 25 01:07:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say over spraying like scotomaniac said, but another issue could be the shirt itself. If the shirt has been washed multiple times the threads start to pull away from each other and can lead to results like this. If it's a brand new shirt then it's over spraying."

I don't pay attention, I just assume Costco is a good deal and I like those shirts.  One type of bleach. How dilute the bleach is and how long you leave it on changes the colour.  Ive never sold a shirt. If I paid myself minimum wage for the time I spend on making a shirt for myself or as a gift for somebody else, the labour would run just over a hundred dollars, nevermind the materials cost. I wouldn't call it a profit making venture."

The machine has not been the problem, rather the stencil maker (yours truly).  I plan on redoing some of my prior patterns to fix the issues.  But, you cannot beat the Cameo!  Expensive but amazing toy!  Plan to fire it up this weekend for some new designs, will share once done.   As an aside, if you do use a machine, the cutting IS faster, but you spend quite a lot of time weeding the design.  So there are drawbacks to the method."

Sometimes it can be little flecks of paper on there that will just wash out, and then sometimes it's the waxy backside that gets stuck in there.  Usually I try taking a fresh piece of freezer paper and ironing it over the trouble spot, and hopefully it will pull up either problem when you peel it off."

For whatever reason, newspaper soaks out the residue. Just keep using fresh pieces of the paper to make sure it gets out all the wax. I will say though, if it doesn't seem to be the waxy leftovers, over ironing may result in stiff fabric. :/"

I like your a lot better though - Sadly, a lot of detail was lost on mine purely because it was so tiny... But that was one of the biggest reasons I made it so small - I wanted to challenge myself.  I was hanging out with her last weekend, and she still has it hanging on her photo board, FWIW.  Quick question though: Did you use a two part stencil? It looks like certain parts are darker than others, and that's usually only possible with a two part stencil..."

bleachshirts,397jd5,regular-wolf,-2,Tue Jun 9 22:55:39 2015 UTC,It's a step up from bronies in my opinion. At least she's close to being human.
bleachshirts,397jd5,superdude4agze,2,Wed Jun 10 19:47:22 2015 UTC,Mermaids date back to ~1000 BC.  I think folklore with that kind of history is more than a step up from a children's cartoon (no matter how many middle aged beard-growers love it).
bleachshirts,397jd5,regular-wolf,-1,Wed Jun 10 20:29:27 2015 UTC,Not seeing the point you're attempting to make.

bleachshirts,38yhiu,ProstatePunch,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"Didn't really do layers in the traditional sense with stencils. I just removed different parts' paper as I went. Card first, then letters/fire, then background so the shadowy bits of the letters would stand out."

bleachshirts,38yhiu,ProstatePunch,2,Wed Jun 10 07:29:02 2015 UTC,How do I know what colour it's going to turn after I put bleach on? Or is it always white with enough of it?
bleachshirts,38yhiu,Wood_Warden,2,Mon Jun 8 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on the color and brand of the shirt. The American Apparel black ones don't seem to come out as orange as some of the others I've used. There's definitely still a hint of it, but not like black Hanes shirts I've done. Most red and green shirts I've used have come out white when bleached. Navy seems to almost always go quite pink."
bleachshirts,38yhiu,Wood_Warden,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:58:38 2015 UTC,Hmm I've got a black shirt and I want to make a band's logo on it but it has to be white..

bleachshirts,38z35b,runjumpfly_fit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:59:56 2015 UTC,I absolutely love the hexagon shirt pattern. howd you make that stencil
bleachshirts,38z3pf,stokleplinger,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"Kinda disappointed with the bleeding on the edges, but the design itself pressed the limits of my vinyl cutter.

I may end up having to keep it up for the remainder.  We'll see!"
bleachshirts,38wb0a,Cythero-CyberToke,3,Sun Jun 7 11:02:10 2015 UTC,I've tried painted before but it never turns out well. What kind of paint did you use?
bleachshirts,38wb0a,hollywoodbob,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:12:02 2015 UTC,"the Brand i am using is Javana Textil. its german, but really, if you type Textile Paint into Amazon you should be able to find one that works. i have also used paints by brand called Nerchau"

bleachshirts,38wb0a,disorderedmind,2,Sun Jun 7 22:44:45 2015 UTC,Looks kinda like an India ink bottle
bleachshirts,38wb0a,disorderedmind,2,Sun Jun 7 12:37:35 2015 UTC,Nicely done! Do you peel the stencil off while the paint is still wet or leave til it's dry?
bleachshirts,38wb0a,dipthonggirl,3,Sun Jun 7 15:29:32 2015 UTC,"both works, though you have to be a lot more careful when its still wet. in this case i actually hit it with a blowdryer on high heat and low speed for half a minute or so before peeling to dry it a bit and reduce risk. EDIT: if you peel it while dry, your paint edges will be rougher and the paper will tear more often while peeling."
bleachshirts,38wb0a,Raielene,2,Sun Jun 7 15:43:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips! Will definitely give this a try once my freezer paper order arrives :)

bleachshirts,38wb0a,Niccalo,2,Sun Jun 7 22:45:05 2015 UTC,Wait... did you iron it to the shirt and then cut?  Doesn't that cut the shirt?
bleachshirts,38wb0a,ConfusionInTheRanks,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"not if you do it right, takes a little bit of practice, however, it lets you have more accurate designs because you need much less bridges."
bleachshirts,38vcgp,firesignpunk,2,Sun Jun 7 03:35:08 2015 UTC,These are amazing. Are you using any software to help with the stencils?
bleachshirts,38vcgp,ChaseDFW,2,Sun Jun 7 13:51:43 2015 UTC,"We use photoshop to isolate images if we're not using a traditional stencil, also to erase out any background noise.  I usually draw on the image if I need to alter it/re-interpret it."
bleachshirts,38vcgp,Autoboat,2,Sun Jun 7 14:51:42 2015 UTC,Those are amazing! Your attention to detail is incredible. It looks like you are getting some really nice colors. I see that the black Gildan is 100% cotton - are the rest of the shirts the same maker/material? I would love to have a final product that stands out so bold.
bleachshirts,38vcgp,Autoboat,2,Tue Jun 9 00:22:28 2015 UTC,"Hanes or Gildan work for me, anything majority cotton it's really the bleach concentration/good seal on the stencil to the shirt and a fine and evenly sprayed mist that makes things pop out vibrantly.  My girlfriend just started buying blank/solid shirts from Threadless because they fit and feel better than the generics."

bleachshirts,38vcgp,disorderedmind,2,Wed Jun 10 01:22:04 2015 UTC,It took her about a week for that one.  She'd do a little bit and then put it down when it got frustrating or painful on her hands and pick it back up another day.  She amazes me with her skill and patience.

bleachshirts,38v6r6,GreatRegularFlavor,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"I say ""2nd official"" because the very first time was about 3 years ago using cardboard for the stencils. Yes, cardboard. The shirt came out fine but the lines were more of a blur.   My first attempt was an Avengers shirt I made for my son and when I saw that the small details came out fine, I felt prepared for this 2nd project.   The slight discoloration in the midde of the dark blue shirt is a camera/lighting thing."

bleachshirts,38tgqc,Ailouros_Venom,2,Sun Jun 7 00:23:09 2015 UTC,"pretty simple process, make the stencil, iron on, cut out. i have a small mister bottle for bleaching, i usually aim for 50/50 to 60/40 bleach/water mix. spray on just enough to get even coverage, blot everything with a paper towel, then go over with the iron to get it to lighten faster. repeat as necessary to get desired color or for each layer. It might be the shirt as well, the ones i used for this were hanes 60/40 cotton/poly. Hope that helps."
bleachshirts,38tgqc,Ailouros_Venom,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:43:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, I don't iron for speed. I just spray and wait. Also, I use Gildan 100% cotton. Ironing seems to be the trick. Thank you. Your shirts are cool. :)"

bleachshirts,37zh1a,Phanron,3,Sun May 31 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"Original image by Kanekomodera    Instead of using freezer paper replacement, this time I tried out transparencies and adhesive spray. for each layer I printed out the image on 4 transperencies, glue them together, cut them and applied each stencil to the shirt. Once you let the spray dry out for 20 minutes it becomes like a sticky note. The results are super clean (if you spray each line). Cutting was a problem. Hard to cut deteails. If I could get my hands on a roll of thin transperency instead of Din A4 ones I'd be golden.  /u/BleachMePlz wanted to know how I would line up the layers. Actually, thats a problem. What I did was stretching the shirt so that it fit. I could see through the transperency. But I honestly think that if you want to do multilayer bleaching, having one stencil and removing each part you want to layer is the way to go (never really tried)."

bleachshirts,37zh1a,cowflu,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:02:53 2015 UTC,"What brand/type of adhesive spray did you use?  I've used clear plastic report covers as templates (they were slightly rubbery? so cut easier) and then was able to reuse them.  To adhere them I took a very thin layer of white school glue (so thin you can't see it) which worked quite well (it washes out of the shirt), but it's tricky to get it just right. I was thinking of adhesive spray, but wasn't sure which one would come back off the shirt again."
bleachshirts,37zh1a,MinnesotaUnited,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:08:46 2015 UTC,"I used UHU 3 in 1 spray adhesive. Quite expensive but the only one my store had. It doesnt leave traces on the shirt. Like I said, its like a sticky note."
bleachshirts,37zh1a,Grimblewedge,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"Whoa looks incredible! I wish you took a picture of the whole shirt so that way I could get a better feel of how the whole shirt looks :) It honestly looks like its more than just two layers and lines look crisp but smooth!  As for how you lined up the layers, it looks pretty spot on.  I was under the impression that you were going to use freezer paper which would've made the super positioning of the layers very difficult but I could see how the transparencies solved that issue!  Now about using just one stencil for a multilayer project, I realized there might be a few problems you might be faced with.  One: When you apply the bleach layer, how do you plan on stopping the bleach from eating away from the shirt? Will you wash it with the stencil on the shirt or would you apply some kind of neutralizing solution to stop the bleach reaction? Two: I imagine if you left the bleach on the shirt long enough without washing it while working on the 'second' layer, the bleach would start to bleed out into the shirt and beneath the stencil.  I remember someone in this subreddit was mentioning this as well.  Ideally I would love to use just one stencil but I've yet to figure out how to deal with the two problems I just talked about...   I'm hoping to make another shirt over the summer.  I plan on upping the ante >:)"
bleachshirts,37zh1a,ManofTheNightsWatch,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:01:39 2015 UTC,I added a picture to the album just for you ;)  As for using only one stencil. I would cut the stencil beforehand and remove every part quickly. Time is the most important factor I think. Saw a clockwork orange shirt with 8 layers on this subreddit. From my experience it doesnt bleed as long as you dab the bleach away and have your lines glued to the shirt well. Also the right bleach to water ratio is important. I think using freezer paper in this case is better than transparencies as you can somehow keep the stencil whole even though you cut it.
bleachshirts,37zh1a,hollywoodbob,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:01:11 2015 UTC,"Did you spray the stencil, wait 20 minutes, then stick it on the shirt or spray the stencil, stick it on the shirt, then wait 20 minutes?

bleachshirts,37zdik,XxSuprTuts99xX,2,Sun May 31 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"Tip: Using spray bottles like this get rid of the droplets and give you a finer spray. This helps with the line blurring because the mist doesn't bleed. I get them at any Walgreens for a few dollars.  Also, if you spray and are worried about it not being light enough, you can always reiron it on, it might cause spots on your iron but they wash off with just soap and water when it cools."
bleachshirts,37zdik,Jocelberry,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:44:35 2015 UTC,"The shield looks really good! In my experience, I've had difficulty doing positive stencils (like the characters inside of the triforce) because they are very easy to over saturate with bleach, which leads to bleeding and unclean lines. My tip would be to use minimal bleach when doing large, inside areas to reduce the bleeding. Less is more, even if it doesn't look like the color has changed much, as long at the shirt is 100% cotton there will be a noticeable difference. Keep calm and bleach on!"

This means you're sensitive, not allergic. Anyway, when you wash the clothes you should be fine. The bleach actually removes the color from the clothes, it doesn't dye them, if that's what you were thinking. There's one thing , though: you'll actually have to handle and be around bleach if you want to make them yourself, so I'm not sure if that would be the best thing for you. However, if somebody gives you a shirt, and they washed it after treating it (a good idea anyway), you should be just fine."

bleachshirts,37uyat,AnOldPhilosopher,3,Sat May 30 20:07:20 2015 UTC,"This may sound silly, but how did you get the bottom of the door to look distinct from the floor?"
bleachshirts,37uyat,AnOldPhilosopher,1 point,Sat May 30 21:16:45 2015 UTC,"I did a few sprays more on the top half than the bottom. Basically I put the whole stencil on there, and then I took another piece and ironed it over the bottom half for the first few sprays, just to give the doorway a brighter look. Then I took off the bottom paper carefully and continued bleaching the whole thing.    Not a silly question at all. The technique isn't obvious just by looking at the stencil, as I did it on the fly with an extra piece. :)"

Plus, I've never actually bleached anything I've designed myself, so there would be IP rights issues, I would think. Mostly, I just make them for friends' birthdays."

bleachshirts,37i2vn,AnOldPhilosopher,1 point,Thu May 28 09:02:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and yup! It actually wasn't too bad. I used self-adhesive vinyl instead of freezer paper. :) There's a lot more control when cutting vinyl."
bleachshirts,37i2vn,AnOldPhilosopher,1 point,Thu May 28 09:09:26 2015 UTC,"Oh that's cool, haven't looked into using vinyl. So it's a little easier to use then?  Does using vinyl allow you to take off the stencil and re-use it?"
bleachshirts,37i2vn,AnOldPhilosopher,2,Thu May 28 09:30:37 2015 UTC,"I can't say since I haven't made shirts with freezer paper before; I just know from previous bookmaking experience which materials are easier to work with. Vinyl is less prone to tearing and small details are easier to do since the vinyl holds shape better.   The stencils can be reused as long as when you're first applying them you don't put them on and replace them too many times, as the fibers from the shirt will make it less sticky.  When I was done bleaching the shirt I dunked the whole thing, with the vinyl stencils on, into water."
bleachshirts,37i2vn,AnOldPhilosopher,1 point,Thu May 28 17:14:26 2015 UTC,"That's cool, I'm gonna look into vinyl once my Freezer paper is out then. Do you cut on the T shirt or before you apply it?"
bleachshirts,37i2vn,HerNameWas_Lola,1 point,Thu May 28 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"Before, you can just peel it off like a sticker when you transfer it to the shirt.    Putting the shirt with the vinyl on into the water makes the stencils super easy to remove, so I recommend doing that instead of peeling them off when the shirt is dry. Removing them when the shirt is wet also helps keep them stickier as less fabric is removed in the process.  The stencils won't feel very sticky when wet but just be sure to transfer them quickly to a plastic or sticker sheet, since they will stick when dried."
bleachshirts,37i2vn,LolCamAlpha,1 point,Thu May 28 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Good call! Just wondering because I'm planning to make a few of the same designs on different colours for me and my brother to wear, so vinyl would be better for that than continuous use of freezer paper (not that FP is bad, it's just one time use.)  EDIT: One more question, (sorry for the AMA) where do you source your vinyl from? I found a roll for like six quid on Amazon."

bleachshirts,377i5h,Lexyt1,6,Mon May 25 14:48:33 2015 UTC,"If you want to try any of these yourself, here are the stencils: http://imgur.com/a/Fn8iP These were all found online somewhere. Since then, I've made a few stencils myself which I'll post when I bleach them onto shirts.  For these, I used freezer paper and a pair of scissors (I don't have an exacto knife) to make the stencils, and then ironed them on. I used a solution of 50:50 Bleach:Water (thin bleach from a supermarket) and dabbed after each coat.   I would wholeheartedly recommend investing in some freezer paper, I got mine here: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Reynolds-Freezer-Paper-Plastic-Coated/dp/B00EME5KZ0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432566044&sr=8-1&keywords=freezer+paper Freezer paper is great as it sticks really well to the tshirt and as long as you dab properly after each coat of bleach, you get no leaking under your stencils. My first attempt at this (more of an experiment) was using a cardboard stencil, and I didn't dab either, so it didn't go too well. Proof: http://i.imgur.com/zNRSGvJ.jpg  I really enjoyed making these, and I'm so happy with the finished product. I'll definitely be doing more in the future."

Just looks kinda odd with the inner two looking one way, and Gengar looking another. Or maybe even flip Ghastly so that they alternate.  I would definitely recommend an exact-o knife, and it makes really tiny cuts much easier. The knife isn't too costly, but I'd suggest a good cutting board too.  With how white they turned out, did you iron them while bleaching? Or was that just the plain spray and dab?"
bleachshirts,377i5h,Ixosis,1 point,Mon May 25 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"I left the bleach in for a fair amount of time on the Yoshi egg, maybe 10-12 minutes, because I wanted it to be as white as possible. I didn't bother ironing while bleaching, I used a hairdryer to try and push it in the right direction but I wasn't noticing much change. And yeah, in hindsight I should have flipped ghastly around, but I still think it looks decent.  I'll look into the exacto knife, but for just starting out I figured scissors would do the trick, especially as the designs aren't too intricate. But I'll probably end up getting one at some point, I have some plans for more shirts."

If so, you might see some holes in the bleached area after future washes. If not, I want to know your secret for getting it so white. :P"
bleachshirts,370jq3,Whine_Flu,1 point,Sun May 24 01:58:20 2015 UTC,"I used brand new bleach that was bought that day. I also used a Wagner 1200 Watt heat gun on high setting, this is better than an iron due to two reasons. Firstly you can heat a larger area with a heat gun quicker. Second, it blows the poisonous chlorine away so that you don't have to buy a respirator like a lot of people here who do the ironing method recommend.  I was afraid the longer you let the shirt sit wet, the more likely the water can diffuse under wax paper, resulting in bleeding of bleach. Since the design is so intricate, especially around the face, it was the only method I thought of to finish bleaching it quick.  Spray, dab immediately, 3x and immediately use heat gun in between. At no point did I let it sit nor did I do a wait. Total process took like less than 4-5 minutes MAX. I know some people do wait 5 minutes and end up with crisp lines but I don't want to wait that long. I just went the fast route by using heat to speed up the process. The cotton does not feel weaker in the bleached area after test stretching all over it. EDIT: I'll continue to wear the shirt weekly and give updates in a few months to see if fabric holds up."

I belatedly realized that I used wax paper instead of freezer paper (I also realized that I don't own an iron anyways, so it wouldn't have helped), so I just taped the papers down near the edges to prevent them from moving too much and they don't look terrible (Only a little bleeding on the left one). I also successfully used a gradient for the right one.    Want to take a guess at which one was actually first?   Also, the symbol is from an anime just called K, but it's easier to find it if you search K Project. I plan on giving one of the shirts to the friend that introduced me to the anime for her birthday (Whichever style of shirt she prefers and I'll keep the other one)."

Use something other than newspapers to cover the unsprayed parts. When freezerpaper isn't available and making your own doesn't work, you could use half of a laminating pouch. When using a laminating pouch be careful when ironing, the glue could be rubbed from underneath the plastic part."

bleachshirts,36ofj6,The-Eleventh-Doc,5,Wed May 20 21:35:23 2015 UTC,"Wax paper wouldn't be a good idea, not that I've ever tried it myself, but when you went to iron the wax would melt to the iron."
bleachshirts,36ofj6,shehungry,1 point,Wed May 20 22:01:13 2015 UTC,Yep.  I've seen someone try this.  It just melts to the iron like you said.
bleachshirts,36ofj6,electrovir,5,Mon May 25 21:15:36 2015 UTC,"As /u/shehungry stated, wax paper is only going to stick to the iron when you try and flatten the design. If you really don't have access to freezer paper or the supplies to make it yourself, Parchment paper works in a pinch, but doesn't adhere to the shirt itself, so your lines may not come out as crisp as they would otherwise."
bleachshirts,36ofj6,DeusJZ,1 point,Wed May 27 17:17:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip.  I think I'm going to go ahead and make it the paper.
bleachshirts,36ofj6,smitehamner,1 point,Wed May 27 19:59:35 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to have somewhat fuzzy edges, wax paper can work. I just did my first shirts and belatedly realized that I used wax paper instead of freezer paper (I also realized that I don't own an iron anyways, so it wouldn't have helped). I just taped the papers down near the edges to prevent them from moving too much and they don't look terrible. The bleach itself was rather easy to wipe up since it didn't want to stick to either side."

bleachshirts,36fuvx,jnethery,6,Tue May 19 14:27:49 2015 UTC,"I do thin lines all the time with no problems the key is have a couple folded up squares of paper towel with you while your are spraying.  Spray a fine mist... then immediately paper towel up the extra. Wait a minute or 2 to dry (even better if you work outside in the sun or use a hair dryer) then do it again. The bleach stays in and will do the fading you need but it never pools into enough to bleed under your lines.  Also if you notice your paper starting to lift, give it another run over with your iron. Helps dry it as well."
bleachshirts,36fuvx,JimmyNice,2,Tue May 19 11:28:13 2015 UTC,"Spraying too much bleach at once, especially without doing a few pats with dry paper towels, will definitely cause this (or promote it).   I did an Avengers shirt for my son last weekend and was worried about Ironman's icon bleeding since the lines were thin. I'd spray 2-3 quick sprays, off-set from each other, then immediately dab with a paper towel a few times. And when I say dab, I don't mean lightly. I'd press down on it with a bit more force than needed. This way, I'd also sort of pick up any excess liquid from the cloth and keep it from pooling. The lines came out very crisp.   If you feel the paper towel is becoming even the slightest saturated, fold it over or get another piece. Remember: paper towels are relatively cheap when compared to the cost of a shirt and the time/effort of creating a stencil."

bleachshirts,36fuvx,crazyguyjacob,1 point,Wed May 20 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"I noticed with one of my shirts it was because I sprayed too much water on the paper and it peeled off the shirt and made the bleach bleed. Making sure all your points are flush with the shirt is the first thing you should do, and then just spray enough to bleach the shirt but not too much where it'll curl your freezer paper."
bleachshirts,36fuvx,wubbwubbb,1 point,Tue May 19 02:51:48 2015 UTC,The only time I had a bleeding problem is when the shirt was wet before bleaching.  I had the steam setting on when applying the freezer paper and it was a huge issue.

bleachshirts,36ewm3,B3AROTAN,3,Tue May 19 07:04:02 2015 UTC,"I used a very fine mist spray bottle. I went over it three times, each time spraying very lightly and dabbing up the excess moisture with paper towels after a few seconds to minimize it soaking into the fibers too much. I then ironed it very quickly and lightly to activate the chlorides (this makes it lighter, but creates chlorine gas, so be VERY careful), and then immediately threw it in a cold wash cycle."

bleachshirts,36du4i,Sarcasticjazz,2,Mon May 18 16:31:46 2015 UTC,I'm in awe at your skill to accurately stencil the barcode design. How did you get it white on black?
bleachshirts,36du4i,DeusJZ,3,Tue May 19 01:30:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It took the spare time I had over the course of a couple days to complete the stencil alone (although I had some mishaps and a tear here and there, plus some bleeding in the middle.) I'm not exactly sure what you mean by your question, but I found the stencil on google by typing in ""spaghetti barcode"", printed it out to scale and traced the design onto my freezer paper shading in the black areas of the design (white being background).  I then just cut out the shaded areas, leaving just the white background.  I ironed it on to a black shirt and bleached it for about an hour (not sure why it took that long, plus it has a hint of very faint orange still in it, rather than an eggshell white). Lastly, I just washed it and boom, white design (from the bleach) onto a black shirt (pretty much invert colors from the original design) BTW I love your shirts!"
bleachshirts,36du4i,DeusJZ,2,Tue May 19 01:55:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but I was simply wondering who you got the bleach to dilute the black dye enough to have the design shift from orange to white.

bleachshirts,366lqw,romafa,5,Sat May 16 20:03:00 2015 UTC,Use freezer paper. One side is like parchment paper and the other is waxy. I cut it into letter paper size and run it through the printer.

bleachshirts,364dwz,Cheaply,1 point,Sat May 16 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for OP, but 60-65/35 ratio usually works well for me, dab it lightly. Run an iron within the first three minutes. You can usually get a whiteish result in about 20 minutes if you repeat the process a few times, letting it soak for a little bit before and after dabbing. Do it correctly, and you'll barely be able to tell from the inside of the shirt that there's a design bleached into it."

That being said, I've also used 40/60 and 60/40 mixtures to get slightly lighter and darker shades. You can also use an iron or a hairdryer to increase the speed of the bleaching process.    That being said, yes, the bleach does wear down the fabric you are using. But as long as you are not using too strong of a mixture or leave it on too long, you should be fine. Especially since you mentioned you are using denim, you should not have to worry about anything at all."

bleachshirts,35mnrp,octaffle,3,Mon May 11 20:01:17 2015 UTC,You don't put pure bleach directly onto the clothes.  You put it into the water to dilute it to well below 50%.    Try 60/40 if 50/50 isn't cutting it.

I've made close to 50 shirts using at least 7 different brands of fabric, and I've never had trouble as using any of those techniques.   edit; I noticed in your other comment you said ""pure bleach, since it's for clothes"". You shouldn't be using bleach detergent that you put into you washing machine. You need to use this kind of bleach, used for cleaning bathrooms and the like. Although you can use this in your washing machine strictly for whites, I know others have made the mistake of trying to bleach shirts with just the detergent with no success."

bleachshirts,357vxu,Timbo925,5,Thu May 7 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"I assume you're asking how I got the bleach to go white? So typically when you bleach a darker color, it goes to that deep orange/amber color. The jellyfish here is actually a mess of color between white/cream/pink and kinda gray.  What I do is spray the shirt with the stencil and wait about a minute. Then I blot the sprayed parts to soak up some of the bleach. While this is happening, I have an iron set to just about as high as it will go. This is what makes the bleach get all creamy. I used to use a hair dryer on high, but it took to long.  I warn you, this process will most likely get trace amounts of bleach on the iron. So make sure this is an iron you won't use for something else. Also, it will probably drag that bleach across the shirt and cause it to react with other parts of the shirt. I don't go for perfect bleach shirts with crisp edges so that doesn't bother me.  But yea, if you want creamy bleach shirts, iron them BEFORE you neutralize the bleach."

The spray pattern wasn't ideal, it didn't really get anything in the center of the spray area, it was mostly like a ring. We'll look into getting a better spray bottle  Freezer paper stencil Gloves for protection Iron Plywood inside the shirts  For the process:   Blue shirt we sprayed 3-4 times and then dabbed with paper towels. We then let it sit for 5 minutes before dunking in the cold bath. Probably should have dabbed after each application instead to get more contrast.   Black shirt we sprayed 3 times, this time dabbing after each application. The bleach worked fast so we dunked it after about 4 minutes.   Both shirts we rung out and then dried in the dryer.   ** Things for next time** We have sodium thiosulfate coming, otherwise known as Bleach-Stop or bleach neutralizer. This will be mixed with the cold bath to completely stop the bleaching process   Also ordered a swivel xacto knife to make cutting the stencils easier.   We have Duralar .005 on the way along with 3M Super 77 adhesive spray for the stencils.   On the list will be full face respirators.

bleachshirts,34v1ag,takeshikun,2,Mon May 4 22:06:06 2015 UTC,"Only speaking from 1 shirt worth of experience, but I ironed for at least 10 seconds (as in placed on a part, hands off iron, count to 10, move) on almost-max setting until I noticed the paper was slightly more translucent in that area and had no problems with bleeding or smaller edges.  If you have some spare cloth, just mess around with a few slivers of freezer paper and see how long it takes."
bleachshirts,34v1ag,PootieTangYeah,2,Mon May 4 22:07:49 2015 UTC,"It's also possible that you got the paper too wet.  My routine is more spray-wipe-wipe (dab-dab, really), each wipe with a dry paper towel.  Then maybe repeat, if necessary. I try not to let any bleach collect on the fabric or paper.  I also use a stronger bleach solution than most suggest so I can get the fabric to lighten with less liquid.  Is the bleach bleeding beneath the paper?  If not, this may not be the problem.  I found that too much ironing can cause the freezer paper to separate, but that may be my imagination.  Like others have mentioned, I test the areas with my finger to see if the paper lifts off easily after ironing, and pay special attention to the corners.  And be very careful with dabbing the corners and pointy bits after spraying so they don't separate.  It is a real trial and error process for me.  The trick is trying to find the sweet spot for all of these variables."

bleachshirts,34ox36,Dospunk,2,Sun May 3 14:51:34 2015 UTC,"Don't make the iron too hot, the stencil will get stuck.  If you want to do layers, cut out everything, then use masking tape to re-attach the layers and cover the lines. That way you don't have to cut on top of the shirt.  Make a simpler design than this one here for your first, I saw a tree one on here yesterday, that's perfect for the first time.  This tutorial is good, you can get a feel of how the process goes. (Just don't cut on top of the shirt, like he did.)"

bleachshirts,34p9a8,LolCamAlpha,1 point,Sun May 3 13:17:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of dyes are made from more than one color of pigment, each one a combination unique to the shirt manufacturer. Not all pigments bleach at the same speed, so as you bleach the shirt, it can go through more than one color change before going nearly white. Also why one manufacturers green shirt will turn a different color than another manufacturer's."

It's also not quite as pure white in person as it looks in the photo. It definitely has an orange tint to it.  As for the relief look, I just did it in layers, but I left a tiny crack of shirt along the bottom of the ""tears"" so it got as much bleach as the A, and I left a line of paper along the top to get a fake shadow.

bleachshirts,33xe77,Protoss_Pylon,-17,Mon Apr 27 15:22:34 2015 UTC,Good job but I think it shrunk in the washing machine. Use cold water next time and let it air dry.

bleachshirts,33vkag,TheFrankLapidus,18,Sun Apr 26 02:52:44 2015 UTC,Work thing. You tell someone you can make shirts and suddenly everyone wants a piece. :)
bleachshirts,33vkag,mythozoologist,5,Sun Apr 26 03:53:14 2015 UTC,I made a shirt for a guy at work once. No he keeps telling me the kinda shirts he wants all the time.
bleachshirts,33vkag,do-rae-mi,6,Sun Apr 26 04:45:49 2015 UTC,Did you cut out a new stencil for each shirt or make a more permanent stencil?
bleachshirts,33vkag,do-rae-mi,5,Sun Apr 26 04:17:03 2015 UTC,hellz no. used duralar sheets. Made one that lasted 11 shirts until I tore it. The other's still in great shape. Duralar .005 sheets + Krylon spray adhesive.
bleachshirts,33vkag,n0wl,2,Sun Apr 26 07:41:46 2015 UTC,Awesome. I've been looking for something that's better for multiple uses! Thanks!

bleachshirts,33tg4i,electroskank,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:51:19 2015 UTC,"Kind of, but I only make the shirts as they get ordered, and I'm still not sure how to do that in Etsy... I can't possibly make a listing for every design I've ever done, as that number is in the hundreds...  So far selling them through Reddit messages has been going pretty well, except for the two people that just kinda fell through on payment... But, having people pay in advance should fix that problem, and so far people have been willing to give me that piece of security. : )"
bleachshirts,33tg4i,electroskank,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:56:01 2015 UTC,"You could make a listing for ""custom order""  and have them send a message of what they want.

bleachshirts,33vc5i,shiseido_red,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:54:05 2015 UTC,"These shirts were largely painted instead of bleached, but I used the same techniques of stenciling with freezer paper and an iron.  The pic of the Detroit Tigers shirt was taken immediately after peeling.There was still a good bit of freezer paper stuck to the shirt in the pic, but it's the only picture I have. There's one tiny line on the Ballerina shirt where the two pieces of freezer paper didn't overlap enough, but overall I'm really pleased with it. I had a bit of bleed through with the Serenity shirt, but I kind of went with it and added some general speckling. I think it works for Firefly. All of the giftees seemed to be really happy with their gifts.  I'm most pleased with the Star Trek shirt. It was for my father in law, who's in his 80s, and is the biggest Trek fan I've ever met. He says hello and goodbye to people with the Vulcan Salute. Pretty awesome guy.  And finally, here's an album with the picture part of the stencils. I added the text straight from Word. Got Fonts off of DaFont.  Stencils"
bleachshirts,33vc5i,takeshikun,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:58:45 2015 UTC,"These are really nice, what kind of paint do you use and how well does it hold up?"
bleachshirts,33vc5i,takeshikun,2,Tue Apr 28 00:26:59 2015 UTC,"I've mainly used Tulip's ""soft"" paints. They're affordable, go on nicely, and seem to last very well. I have a Hunger Games and Zelda shirt that are almost two years old and still look pretty good. They're just starting to get a little cracking on the paint, but not more than a screen printed tee would at that age. Oh, and I use the little cheap foam brushes to paint. A very light coat gets carefully dabbed/painted on, then once that dries some a second coat is more painted on.   I'm working on a batch of Avengers related shirts for a group of friends right now. We're going to a double header IMAX of Avengers and AoU and I'm making shirts for all of us. I'll post them later this week.   Thanks!"

Mistakes on a shoe are far more expensive than mistakes on a shirt. I wouldn't use freezer paper because I doubt it can cling to the uneven surface of the shoe. Try painters tape or something and post the results."

bleachshirts,33tfsn,Onlyhereforthelaughs,2,Sat Apr 25 13:31:05 2015 UTC,Very well done. How did you get such sharp lines?
bleachshirts,33tfsn,LordandShaver,2,Sat Apr 25 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"A very fine mist, along with lots of dabbing up the excess. Then, while the shirt is still somewhat damp, I hit it with a hot iron. I just repeat until white, and pray the lines are still crisp. :D"

bleachshirts,33tfr3,OceanOfVitaminC,2,Thu Apr 30 03:43:37 2015 UTC,"Stencil link  The colors i have on there are:  Black - Original shirt color  White-ish - Mask color achieved by bleaching and ironing repeatedly  White-ish yellow - Same technique as white-ish, but not taken as far  and Redish Orange - 50/50 bleach spray with no ironing  The way I did this one was a little tricky. I forgot to adjust the stencil at all for the various colors, but I made it work. First I put all the stencil pieces onto the shirt, and then remove the middle piece that is the mask face. Cover all seams with additional Freezer paper.  Once the mask is as white as you can get it, remove the big C shape from his forehead, as well the cheeks. Be careful to leave the eyes, you will need to cut the cheek pieces from them. Mouth and head circle stay too. You can decide whether to keep or leave the nose lines.  Spray and iron it more, until you get a lightish color, and then remove the circle on the forehead, and spray a little more bleach over the whole thing, making sure to get even coverage.  Dab up excess, remove eyes and mouth, and douse in cold water."

Most of these were done in GIMP, generally through the editing and combining of already existing images. If the image looks odd that is likely because the B/W is inverted (I try to make my stencils use as little printer ink as possible so the open spaces may be black rather than white). If you want any images of shirts made with these stencils feel free to ask as I photograph most of my finished projects. Same goes for any questions regarding where an individual shirt comes from (like what TV show, band, video game, novel, etc, etc) although I have tried labeling them best I can in imgur.  Feel free to use any of these stencils, that’s why I’m sharing them. Enjoy! I’ll try to check in periodically over the next couple days to answer any questions."

Took several hours (I was watching a couple movies while I did it so my focus was divided but still...).  Am gonna totally use your stencil, can never have too many Death Grips shirts."

bleachshirts,333ggv,kacper19990,3,Sun Apr 19 08:25:28 2015 UTC,"The white card took a lot of ironing while the bleach was still wet on the shirt. I sprayed a very fine mist over it, and ironed it over and over until it was as white as it would go. (Same bleach/water mix)  After that was done, I did the outer stencil that included the card, so there wouldn't be any gaps between the two sections.  After I was happy with that color, I took off the stencil and speckled the shirt with a trigger bottle."
bleachshirts,333ggv,kacper19990,3,Sun Apr 19 15:29:49 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll try and achieve something like that on the next shirt I'll make ;)

Card only  Glow and letters (After card)  I would recommend putting the glow/letters stencil on the shirt first, and then ironing the card stencil over that, so that you have it positioned exactly how you want it. Once the card is bleached and ironed to your liking, peel that stencil off, and put a fine mist over the rest of it. :)"

bleachshirts,330r5x,ashabanapal,13,Sat Apr 18 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"I don't use freezer paper as everything I make I want to be able to remake, so I used this film that I think is used for screen printing. I adhere it to the shirt using Elmer's adhesive spray and letting it tack dry for a few minutes before applying.  I used a solution of bleach and water at a ratio of 1:3. I spray a layer, blot it with a towel, then hair dryer until it's dry. Cover up a layer. Spray, blot, hair dryer, cover, spray, blot, hair dryer, etc.  Middle of tongue was one app, rest of tongue was two apps, outer spray was three, mouth was 4, eyes were 7.  I believe the weakness of the solution and blotting and drying is key to the crisp lines."
bleachshirts,330r5x,goodnames679,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:03:38 2015 UTC,Do you think that film is usable for multiple designs? I've been looking for something like that which is cuttable by x-acto knife but can be reused.

bleachshirts,330r5x,Grimsonite,3,Wed May 13 02:20:09 2015 UTC,"Using freezer paper. If you use carton as template it'll be diluted into it and it'll get smushy like that. If you dilute the bleach too much It'll take way more time to bleach the shirt, giving it time to spread out. So diluting a little bit works. You will need to work faster because it'll damage the fabric.  Also in my experience using normal bleach instead of gel-ish concentreated bleach is important. If you dilute the concentreated bleach it doesn't become homogene. Some parts are watery and some parts are still like the gel."

bleachshirts,32z4vi,Painted_Seven,3,Sat Apr 18 04:53:28 2015 UTC,"I don't.  Perhaps I will in the future.  Basically, I drew the picture and decided what I wanted to be dark and what I wanted to be light.  Then I cut the first (lightest) layer off, ironed the stencil on, and bleached.  Then, I cut each layer off while the stencil was still on the shirt and applied a layer of bleach.  The moon, pterodactyl (the paper came up a little so it's not very clear), and the first layer are all ironed to make them lighter.  Glad you liked it! It's definitely my favorite that I've done so far."

bleachshirts,32l90f,shiseido_red,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"As long as it is an inkjet printer (NOT laser jet) you should be fine. I do it all the time. Microsoft Paint has a feature to split your print across multiple pages if you're going for larger than printer paper as well. It leaves about a half inch margin. Just make sure you overlap on margins to avoid bleed through.   My printer is a little stupid and likes to either not grab the freezer paper or jam with it. Two things help. Flatten the freezer paper under books or something. The more rolled up it is the more it will jam. I also put a piece of plain paper behind the freezer paper (just in the print tray) to encourage the printer to grab the freezer paper.   It's usually kind of tricky to print on to freezer paper, but the results are worth it. Much faster than tracing or cutting through the print out and the freezer paper at once."

bleachshirts,32dthc,BleachMePlz,5,Sun Apr 12 23:36:46 2015 UTC,"Here is the original image: http://imgur.com/TBQB4eA  I converted the image into a greyscale image and I extracted two different grey levels (one for each layer).  I traced the image onto the freezer paper and then I ironed the freezer paper onto the shirt.  Only then did I start cutting out freezer paper with an x-acto knife. Surprisingly, as long as you don't apply a lot of pressure, the knife didn't produce any tears on the shirt! It would've been impossible for me to cut the freezer paper prior to ironing it for there were a lot of 'islands' that I would have to manually iron onto the shirt. I knew this wouldn't be ideal because I was planning on applying a second layer and I figured this would make it very difficult to align.  If you look closely, you could see that I wasn't able to align the two layers perfectly.  What I didn't account for initially is that the shirt may have shrunk when I put it in the dryers.  Also, depending on how much the shirt is stretched when you're laying it flat, the image can be significantly distorted.  Aligning the second layer on top of the first layer was such a pain.  What I tried doing was cutting out random segments from freezer paper and aligning those to the beached shirt.  Can't say I was too successful but it's hard to notice the errors when you aren't aware of them.    I can answer any other questions you may have.  I feel that this was definitely worth the time and effort!"

bleachshirts,32dthc,Sir_Stabbington,2,Mon Apr 13 01:55:05 2015 UTC,Thanks that means a lot!! gg
bleachshirts,32dthc,Sir_Stabbington,2,Mon Apr 13 02:51:18 2015 UTC,"This is incredible work!  My own process is very similar from conception to application. The big difference is that I use sticky vinyl book protector stuff from the dollar store and do all of my layers in one go, cutting out the next layer after my first bleach applications. Never have to worry about missing the registration of that second stencil and with the vinyl there's no ironing required. I love it."
bleachshirts,32dthc,MrSkoozi,2,Mon Apr 13 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"Do you mind if you expand on what you said? That sounds like a really interesting idea!  I think what I'm a bit confused about is when you said that you 'do all my layers in one go"".  By that, do you mean you use just ONE vinyl and you cut out the the next layers after each bleach application? If so, how do you stop the bleach from eating away your shirt while cutting out the next layer? I heard you have to submerge the shirt in cold water after waiting 5 minutes from the moment you apply bleach.  Also, do you mind if you link me a pic of the vinyl stuff you use? :) I tried a google image search myself and I found too many different results."
bleachshirts,32dthc,MrSkoozi,2,Mon Apr 13 02:56:00 2015 UTC,"Here's the stuff.  I love it to death.  http://youpinspireme.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/How-to-cover-a-book.jpg  And yeah that's what I mean.  I trace it all out just the once.  Stick the vinyl to the shirt and cut out my first layer.  I usually do 2-3 light mistings, blotting and drying with a hair dryer in between.  Then I start cutting the second layer.  I was under the same impression when I first started so my first few shirts wound up being lighter than I'd have liked so I decided to experiment. The bleach doesn't seem to hurt the shirt once it's blotted and dried (mind you I never get the shirt exactly ""wet"").  My last shirt, I was cutting my second layer for well over an hour.  Here are the results.  http://imgur.com/XTRMoBj  Bonus tip:  When using the vinyl, make sure to blot the bleach off the vinyl as well as you can while being careful not to wash away your drawing.  The bleach will form a white residue as it dries if it's left wet on the stencil and it will make it hard to see what you've drawn underneath it."
bleachshirts,32dthc,MrSkoozi,2,Mon Apr 13 03:06:00 2015 UTC,"Wow your last project looks amazing! I'll definitely try your technique for the next project.    My main concern about using just one stencil was that I feared the bleach would literally cut a whole through the shirt if I didn't wash it off but you pretty much proved otherwise.  Also, it takes me around ~3 hours to cut everything out and that's not including breaks.  I usually take my time cutting this stuff out while watching shows or listening to mixtapes.  I hope that I can just leave the bleach on overnight without having to wash the shirt in between the layers. I'll try this out any ways and I'll let you know about the outcomes! Thanks again for your suggestions/tips!!"
bleachshirts,32dthc,Izzetmaster,2,Mon Apr 13 04:05:35 2015 UTC,Another thought: peroxide will neutralize the bleach reaction so you should be able to stop the bleach at the precise level of fade you are looking for then have ample time to cut your next layer without worrying about the shirt.
bleachshirts,32dthc,ColiflowerEar,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:35:49 2015 UTC,Have you tried that before? That sounds like a really good idea! I normally don't finish my stencil in one sitting because it takes me a few hours so this solution would work wonders for me!
bleachshirts,32dthc,Pacification,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:06:56 2015 UTC,"I've used peroxide to stop the reaction, that works for sure.    I don't know for sure if the dried shirt could then be bleached again successfully (like if the dried peroxide still counters the bleach or not)."
bleachshirts,32dthc,Pacification,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:12:07 2015 UTC,"Ok well that changes everything.  I didn't think about that.  Come to think of it, I imagine it would affect the next bleach layer to an extent depending on how recent I applied the peroxide.  I think my best bet is to try it out on an old shirt once I get the time.  Still, thanks for this awesome tip!"
bleachshirts,32dthc,Pacification,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:45:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I would certainly test it on a scrap of fabric first. My gut tells me it should work if the peroxide is totally dry.

bleachshirts,32a1om,Foobarzot,1 point,Sun Apr 12 07:08:38 2015 UTC,"I just kept spraying the areas that were uneven.  Also, I'd seen someone here mention that they used an iron to make the bleach set in faster, so I ""patted"" it with the iron.  Mostly because I was trying to get the paper stencil to stay adhered to the shirt....  But that did help me figure out which areas needed to be evened out quicker.  And thank you!

bleachshirts,32a1om,psycholepzy,2,Mon Apr 13 00:41:53 2015 UTC,Can you describe further how you maintained the line definition? I'm just starting this out and your results are supreme!
bleachshirts,32a1om,totallynotanadbot,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:07:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I'm fairly new too, but I've been cranking out shirts like crazy.  I use the freezer paper method, so it's really kind of terrifying since you never know if you sealed it properly.  Typically, I do the following:   I iron on the design by setting it on the highest heat level, but I empty the water out of the iron so it won't steam the paper. I use a fairly high bleach concentration when spraying on the bleach.  This makes things work faster, but you do run the risk of overspraying or possibly eating through the fabric. I immediately blot my design and wipe up the paper around it, so that the paper doesn't get wet and make the seal loose. Finally, and this is a BIG iffy DO AT YOUR OWN RISK sort of thing, I would pat my hot iron down on my design in between applications of bleach.  I did this mainly to make sure the plastic was staying sealed onto the shirt, but it also speeds up the bleaching process, which makes the lines pop better.  I never held the iron down on my design and moved it around, because I didn't want to risk moving the stencil.  I would place the iron down for half a second, pick it up, and then place it down on another part of the stencil.  After it cools down completely, be sure to wipe your iron down so that it doesn't have any bleach residue left on it afterwards."
bleachshirts,32a1om,Late_80s,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"I've read a little about that, but the proper temperature to iron it on eludes me. What do you use?   We tried to do wax paper, but couldn't get a good transfer of the design, so we used contact paper - it comes off of paper fairly easily, but we do spend a bit of time peeling the paper off after cutting is done.   Blotting is a must! I found that out on first try and the rest of them were very attended.  I like the idea of the hot iron after bleaching. Just need to make sure it's hot enough to keep the wax sealed to the shirt.  Thanks for your reply!"
bleachshirts,32a1om,marimbajoe,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:23:52 2015 UTC,"No problem!  And yeah, wax paper is typically a bad idea, as the wax can get on the iron and I can only imagine what a pain that would be!  The plastic of the freezer paper melts quickly and clings to the shirt really easily.  As for the iron setting, I crank that sucker up to max (it's 6 on mine).  Good luck!"

Apply to shirt using elmer's all-purpose spray adhesive after letting sit for a couple minutes to tack dry: http://elmers.com/product/detail/E452.

bleachshirts,31ytgh,LolCamAlpha,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:48:03 2015 UTC,This is what I've used. Found some at Dollarama for a Toonie per roll.  My advice is that you are careful with your stencil as this stuff loves to stick to itself when you peel it off the paper. You can get around this by making your stencil in smaller sections that are easy to manage and then arranging them on your shirt to make the full stencil - just be sure to cover up the seams between stencil sections as bleach will get in there.  The stuff that I got has a grid and other information on the backing that makes seeing the image you want to trace challenging at times. My fix was to shine a flashlight up through the back of the image (mimicking a light table). Helped a lot.  This stuff works great for crisp edges. Good luck!
bleachshirts,31ytgh,purplestainedpuddle,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:52:22 2015 UTC,"I've seen some people use duct tape to make their stencils. However, I've had some pretty great success with using painter's tape when my freezer paper stencil messes up. I've used it to put a second layer on my first sedating when it didn't come out as bright as I wanted. I also just posted a shirt where I had to substitute in a cut out piece of tape for the freezer paper, since one of the inner bits of the stencil fell off and wouldn't adhere to the shirt.   It's a bit more difficult to cut stencils out exactly right, but it will work pretty dang well for now, if you want. And painters tape is readily available in most places."

It was published sometime between 1830 and 1833  in the late Edo period as the first print in Hokusai's series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (富嶽三十六景, Fugaku sanjūrokkei ?). It is Hokusai's most famous work, and one of the best recognized works of Japanese art in the world. It depicts an enormous wave threatening boats off the coast of the prefecture of Kanagawa. While sometimes assumed to be a tsunami, the wave is, as the picture's title suggests, more likely to be a large rogue wave or okinami (""wave of the open sea"").  As in all the prints in the series, it depicts the area around Mount Fuji under particular conditions, and the mountain itself appears in the background.

Maybe it really is just really badass dye.  Try shooting an email to the company saying how much you love their shirts and explaining you were trying to do a bleach stencil and it didn't work.  They might respond with info about a treatment they apply to the fabric or how their process is meant to resist such things.

bleachshirts,31gzsu,lordaddament,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:33:42 2015 UTC,That's strange. Did you wash it before you beached it? Or your bleach may be old. Other than that I'm not sure what the problem would be.
bleachshirts,31gzsu,PIMaynard,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:21:25 2015 UTC,Haha thanks for the help anyways. The bleach just took forever to kick in. Sadly by that point I oversprayed by a ton

bleachshirts,31fuyq,KBowBow,1 point,Sun Apr 5 11:20:53 2015 UTC,What process did you use to make that black shirt so white?
bleachshirts,31fuyq,KBowBow,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:52:13 2015 UTC,"How do you mean? This one specifically didn't turn out very pale at all? The higher the concentration of bleach, the more colour it will remove... It also depends on the fabric you start with. But, in my experience, t-shirts that go super white with bleaching also fall apart faster."

bleachshirts,31c69c,TomDoug,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:08:27 2015 UTC,File posted! I wasn't paying too much attention to the amount of sprays because a) I had no idea what I was doing and b) I just wanted the 'stars' to look right. Gonna guess it was about 3-4 which isn't recommended on anything you don't want to look semi messy. Keep an eye on it and be patient between sprays so it isn't overdone.

bleachshirts,317jny,bubbletrollbutt,2,Fri Apr 3 05:12:11 2015 UTC,How you do to bleach white on your shirt?
bleachshirts,317jny,falln09,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:07:07 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look pure white in real life. But since I did a multi layer stencil (sprayed bleach when just the glasses, hair clip, and bunny ears were cut out) then cut out the rest and sprayed again, those parts got the brightest. I used an old Merona t-shirt from target. Looking through the other submissions, sometimes the brand of the shirt makes a difference in how bright it will be."
bleachshirts,31b5ad,charles1er,3,Fri Apr 3 13:57:24 2015 UTC,"Check the expiration date for the bleach, I know it goes bad pretty quickly. Also, make sure you have a bottle meant for it. I kept mine in a random spray bottle and it ate away at the insides and ruined the bottle and all the bleach/water. I'm pretty sure you can pick up special spray bottles that can withstand bleach at a home depot or something."
bleachshirts,31b5ad,DuctTape534,3,Fri Apr 3 16:14:19 2015 UTC,Ty. I saw white particules in my bottle. I decided to make a new solution.
bleachshirts,31b0gr,charles1er,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:10:10 2015 UTC,Do I cut the white pieces one by one ? It seems kinda hard to keep them steady while ironing them after.
bleachshirts,31b0gr,awesomefilleddonut,2,Fri Apr 3 13:13:36 2015 UTC,"You can iron on the stencil and then cut it out while it's on the shirt. That way you don't have to worry about it keeping steady. However, this can be tricky because you want to avoid poking holes in the shirt. It honestly shouldn't be too bad to iron on after it's cut as long as you do it slowly and carefully.  EDIT: If you iron it on before cutting it'll also be easier to cut around the nose holes."
bleachshirts,31b0gr,claytonds,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:07:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you :). Unfortunatly, I already cut it out. But next shirt, I'll try your method."
bleachshirts,31b0gr,DavidJMichaels,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:36:14 2015 UTC,I know you said you've already cut it out so this won't help... But I usually leave a little tab connecting the interior part to the outside like so.  http://i.imgur.com/6jAo9ki.png  Then I iron part of it down then slide an old gift card under the freezer paper and cut the tab off using the gift card as a backing so I don't cut the shirt. It's always worked out well for me.

bleachshirts,311kxv,vjosiah,12,Wed Apr 1 11:20:35 2015 UTC,"If you are using freezer paper as a stencil than these edges are from too much bleach. Less sprays, from further away and make sure to dab with papertowels before it has time to bleed. My initial mistakes were from spraying the shirt until the bleach reaction happened but by that point the shirt is overly saturated and will bleed."
bleachshirts,311kxv,MrSkoozi,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:58:26 2015 UTC,Spray more times with less volume. And then dab the edges with paper towel almost immediately. Don't let the bleach soak in too much.
bleachshirts,311kxv,gingerfr0,3,Wed Apr 1 19:18:17 2015 UTC,"I've tried this 3 times and can't get smooth edges, i think though what you have done is the same as i have, put more bleach on to get it 'even'  resulting in bleeding in places, why? to much bleach. My next attempt im going to get as even as i can in the first two pumps, by keeping the bottle further away from the design when spraying so it covers a wider area than if it was closer, and then to have much more patience and wait."
bleachshirts,311kxv,redcoat888,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:35:54 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same problem but I have got it fixed now, use a small plastic body spray bottle to do a very fine mist and only do a few sprays, immediately dabbing it. Let it dry/react for about 10 minutes and then spray again and repeat this to get better results. Also you can use an iron to go over after each spray which brightens it but be very careful as it produces chlorine gas.   That's what worked for me :)"

That means it almost certainly will not react with the bleach.  The UA shirts I've had were pure synthetic and you weren't even supposed to dry them with any heat so traditional freezer paper ironing on is right out too.  You might try a fabric marker but I doubt you'll be able to do anything to the material - since its designed to be non-reactive (so you can wash your stank off of it easily.)  Sorry, broheim."

bleachshirts,30yff9,Bedpanplayer,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry I took so long for this reply.  Sticky back plastic was alright for a one time use. You have to be careful, as unlike freezer paper it leaks quite easily. You can't iron it on as it would just melt. If you try and re-use it it doesn't stick as well so it leaks more. But other than that it worked like a charm.  You can get sticky back plastic at most stationary shops and at craft shops too. Not too expensive either. But I did find freezer paper at Hobbycraft as well if you prefer, it's just a bit expensive."

Thanks I just want it for a one off stencil but was worried you wouldn't be able to seal it very well and get some leaking! I may try that as you can get it really cheap offline so might give it a shot!  Also you can get freezer paper online which may be cheaper? Have you used it yet? Better or worse than sticky back?

bleachshirts,30pk3f,snogboxx,3,Sun Mar 29 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"Normally my lines are much more crisp than this, but my bleach sprayer gave out about halfway through. I wanted to finish, so I took an old paint brush and used it to apply the rest of the bleach. It's not a perfect process, but it worked. I kinda like how it looks like the letters are rusted."

bleachshirts,30p33m,Pandoras_Penny,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:00:41 2015 UTC,Lol I bought that like 2 weeks ago. Waiting for it to arrive in about 10 more days. I'm paying about 18 dollars in shipping and handling + normal price but it's so worth it!!
bleachshirts,30p33m,colossosbear,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:44:19 2015 UTC,"Gonna go out on a limb and say England? I had the same trouble. I ended up using sticky back plastic brought from a craft shop.   A big roll of about 10 metres was pretty cheap and can be cut to size and then stenciled out too. It sticks well to t-shirts too, with no need to iron it on. The bleach solution can run a bit on top of the plastic though, so make sure to dab it a bit to stop any major bleeds that might happen.  Overall, I would use it again, but would beef up the stencil a bit. My first one was very tiny and tricky."

bleachshirts,2zvei4,OpenionatedGent,0,Sun Mar 22 14:27:14 2015 UTC,Looks good. Thanks so much.
bleachshirts,2zx4zh,ninjordan,5,Sun Mar 22 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"As /u/Sir_Stabbington said, it looks like a combination of over-saturation and not blotting the extra bleach off between sprays.  You might also be spraying foo much each time too.  I do a light spray just enough to wet the cloth, then blot.  Repeat two more times."
bleachshirts,2zx4zh,Crashtard,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"I'm blotting as soon as I spray, but I may be spraying too much. I'll see about a new iron and spray a little less."
bleachshirts,2zx4zh,Crashtard,2,Sun Mar 22 21:40:52 2015 UTC,"I know some people use an iron, I've never used one.  I've also only done single layer stencils, so that's probably why.  You're probably right that it's simply too much spray."

bleachshirts,2zx4zh,mythozoologist,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:54:20 2015 UTC,"After lurking for a while I finally bought some shirts and decided to give it a try. I'm not unhappy with the Steven Universe themed shirt, except for the overspray on the sleeves, but I seriously messed up on the other two.   I think my iron may not have been hot enough, so the paper didn't seal to the shirt, so bleach leaked under the stencil. I'm open to any suggestions or ideas."
bleachshirts,2zvsbk,Sir_LoudMouth,3,Sun Mar 22 06:14:19 2015 UTC,Make sure to iron on freezer paper so that one side melts to it
bleachshirts,2zvsbk,paradoctic,1 point,Sun Mar 22 09:38:07 2015 UTC,This.  Also make sure not to oversaturate. The liquid can travel up through the fibres of the fabric if it becomes too wet.
bleachshirts,2zvsbk,Sir_Stabbington,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:13:55 2015 UTC,Also double check your stencil after every drying. Sometimes you need to re-iron a piece.

I am sorry to have to share bad news, but the second Japanese  character you have should be vertical. It is a letter that extends the sound of the previous character, and is written in the direction of the text. If the Japanese were horizontal it would be fine, but when it is vertically written the bar should be as well. I guess this can be for future reference."

The term is considered a slur by some transgender activists, such as Roz Kaveney.  The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) state that the term is ""usually considered offensive and/or defamatory"" by members of the transgender community.  The gay community is believed to have originated the term,  and many members of the gay community feel the word is a term of endearment.

bleachshirts,2zcxhz,DavidJMichaels,3,Tue Mar 17 15:31:10 2015 UTC,I'm really digging the combination of the multi-layer piece and the speckles.  Plus the logos on the sleeves are a great touch.  It always kinda bugged me when there was just one sleeve with a logo.  Seemed unbalanced.

bleachshirts,2za57g,Painted_Seven,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:30:24 2015 UTC,I have a big roll of freezer paper. It actually only took two pieces of it to make the stencil. I just made sure I stretched it out far enough then roughly traced the shape of the shirt on it and then copied the stencil onto the freezer paper!
bleachshirts,2zdm10,thesk8rguitarist,3,Tue Mar 17 18:32:37 2015 UTC,I would think that many light layers over time would do the trick. Think of it like painting: Many light layers spread over time give sharp lines and no run.
bleachshirts,2zdm10,Eubeen_Hadd,3,Wed Mar 18 01:08:29 2015 UTC,"Here is what I finished today. I took your advice. 70/30 bleach /water, spray lightly 6"" away, dab immediately, followed closely by hair dryer in low right up on it for about a minute. Let it sit for 5-7 minutes. repeat twice."
bleachshirts,2zdm10,dakupoguy,3,Thu Mar 19 04:53:59 2015 UTC,"The two comments already posted made me cringe.  Bleaching shirts is nowhere near like painting. The medium is a complete watery liquid, unlike paint which has slightly some hold.  The shirt is also nowhere near canvas. Many layers of bleach would result in severe destruction of the fibers. Spraying a lot would result in severe bleeding.  The simple answer is ironing. I haven't tried it myself but this is the actual consensus among the heavy shirtbleachers around here."
bleachshirts,2zdm10,loyallemons,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:14:18 2015 UTC,Ironing as in ironing the shirt more? Could you elaborate?
bleachshirts,2zdm10,dakupoguy,2,Sat Mar 21 06:39:01 2015 UTC,"Spray bleach mixture, dab out excess with a cloth, then iron the bleached area you want to be extra whitened."
bleachshirts,2zdm10,lordaddament,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:06:33 2015 UTC,I think its a mix of higher concentration and just spraying a lot.

bleachshirts,2z2p46,ohhaihowyadoinn,7,Mon Mar 16 21:55:13 2015 UTC,It comes across as discouraging and rude. That may not have been your intent but we should be careful to encourage and support each other.

I've been busy the last while and I'm not on reddit extremely often, but I don't view what you've told me as rude at all. I would much rather know ahead of time that there is stiff competition knowing it's going to be an uphill battle, than go in believing there isn't and get destroyed in the market.  Having the experience, time, support, and money you do is excellent, as it's hard to have those things today.   Thank you for letting me know! I really do appreciate it!"

bleachshirts,2ye9pr,frescani,2,Mon Mar 9 01:35:31 2015 UTC,Silhouette cameo. Simple enough. I bought one on Kijiji for $120 (I believe? It's been a bit.. I got it for a steal). This allows you to use a program to cut whatever you want. See my video in the sidebar.  Then you have the cricut which is far less customizable when it comes to the cameo but can do simple jobs with ease.  For reusable stencils... Duralar would work for what you need. Check it out with a quick google search. But honestly if you have a cutter there is no need to reusable stencils as you can just recut!

bleachshirts,2ycisl,aioros84,2,Sun Mar 8 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"For even colour you're going to want as fine a mist as you can get.  (be careful not to breathe it.)  If your spray bottle doesn't mist properly, as I recently found out myself, you're going to have a bad time.  As for the whiteness, I usually do a series of sprays with ten minute intervals in between to give the bleach time to work, until the desired shade is achieved.  I'm also led to understand that using an iron or blow dryer to heat the image after blotting can help to intensify the effect but I have no experience with that myself.  There is plenty of tutorial material and the rest is all trial and error.  It doesn't take long to learn the limits of the materials you're working with.  You learn something new with every shirt IMO."
bleachshirts,2ycisl,Sir_Stabbington,2,Sun Mar 8 21:50:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty accurate, ironing after blotting really does intensify it, you don't actually need to wait for the bleach to change the color, just bleach, blot, iron."
bleachshirts,2ycisl,NeonNinja96,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:01:30 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot. I'll try the blow dryer because the iron tends to burn the stencil. I'll also try bleach painting for even color.
bleachshirts,2ycisl,LiveLongAndPasta,2,Mon Mar 9 06:15:00 2015 UTC,Also I have accidentally ironed through a shirt which was a case of too much bleach in one tiny spot and then heat and friction. I would blot and wait.
