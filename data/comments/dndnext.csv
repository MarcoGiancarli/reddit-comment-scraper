dndnext,3e270x,wuz_lee,41,Tue Jul 21 11:36:03 2015 UTC,I use to be a stickler for what was said in character and out of character.    I've since then become very relaxed with things like this.  What I always ask myself before I enforce a rule is what is more fun.  For my group we like to joke around while we play so for us it makes more sense to allow people to slip in and out of IC and OOC at will.
dndnext,3e270x,Quicknoob,15,Tue Jul 21 12:20:50 2015 UTC,"It depends on the situation too. If the players are discussing strategy mid combat, then I assume they are shouting it out to each other as they fight (unless they have some form of telepathy). In most other situations, it's not worth enforcing."
dndnext,3e270x,tharinock,25,Tue Jul 21 13:15:24 2015 UTC,"Even In combat I give them some leeway. These characters spend weeks, months on the road together, and their main shared interest is fighting monsters and living to spend the loot. You can bet they spend a lot of campfire time talking about tactics in advance, time that we as players just skim over. Players coordinating tactics mid fight stimulates what the group has in their party play book."
dndnext,3e270x,hakuna_dentata,12,Tue Jul 21 13:36:28 2015 UTC,"Yup.

dndnext,3e270x,Jazzeki,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"I try to ask them to do that in downtime between fights or something.  The reason being that if you let them get too ingrained in discussing tactics mid combat it can lead to bogging down of combat rhythm and ""combat coaching"" where one player basically tells another player how to fight with his character (which bothers me).  This way they can discuss while I'm looking up stuff in a book or something and they learn piecemeal instead of being amazing at fighting together all at once.  The bard can tell the fighter ""hey swing around to the other side of the enemy from me, you're blocking my shots and making it difficult for me to help in combat"" and that's better than mid-combat saying ""you move here, he'll move there, and then I can stand twelve squares away over here and shoot without it being an issue.  So and so casts whatever while you turn to grapple that bad guy over there and then in three turns when the effect ends we all turn and focus the BBEG"" which turns into a conversation that lasts ten minutes."

I've found that the intrigue of letting characters discuss plans of actions that are less straightforward then ""I run up and hit it"" is considerably more fun that playing in a straightforward way, so I let them discuss and come to a consensus before they tell me what they say in character.  That said, if someone decides to be brash I let them be brash.  If someone says ""fuck it I slap the king"" I'll make sure they're serious.  If they confirm the action, the slap the king.  I don't allow the ""I stop him when he raises his hand"" bullshit (unless the brashness is going to REALLY negatively affect the entire team's liveliness)."

After enforcing it at the start, the group got comfortable and we just knew when someone was having an ""inner dialogue"" kind of moment.  Since the OOC talk hasn't been abused, I haven't brought the rule back.  I also allow a lot of time for planning and group discussion that doesn't necessarily happen ""in game"".  We, as a group, get together every other week for a day of gaming.  Our characters, however, are travelling together 24/7.  The characters are going to be more efficient discussing things than we are.  They've discussed tactics around the camp fire, they've shared their strengths and weaknesses.  For the characters, it would take a lot less time to figure out the best way to attack a problem.  They also don't have to worry about what the rules of the game allow.  I usually give a 10:1 time difference.  They players can talk about something for 10 minutes, and their characters would have come to the same conclusions in 1 minute."

My group loves it because we all know when someone quickly raises their hands up suddenly, something hilarious and stupid is about to be said. Also, as a gm it makes my job easier because I don't have to be a 'jerk' for choosing to make their words/actions in-game. The rules said so. I'm just following the rules."

Conversely, while we do have the rule at the table, we simply challenge people who aren't doing it correctly, not force their words into their PC's mouth.

That said, I think much ""meta"" conversation is actually far more justifiable than one might initially think.  Some might think it ""meta"" for a character to refer to their ""+1 longsword"" or someone as a ""level 1 fighter"", but humans love to categorize and rank things, e.g. a black belt in jiu jitsu or division one national wrestling champion.  It's generally no less sensible for a person in the fantasy world to numerically rank and categorize things than we do outside the game.  Granted, it might make for more flavor to translate these numeric values into something a bit more flavorful, e.g. Pillar of Eternity's ""Standard"", ""Fine"", ""Exceptional"" and ""Superb"", but that's extra mental work to constantly translate them."

For DnD, which we are running a lot less politically/social encounter based, we don't bother.  IF I was running a big socio political game of DnD, I would have a rule like ""DC 10 Charisma save to avoid blurting out your snarky comment"", mostly because the snarky in character comments tend to lead to drama and action.

dndnext,3e270x,theWild-man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"I kind of have have a set of hand etiquette when at the table. If you are at the table you are assumed to be playing (getting up to grab a drink or take a piss is exempt). Everything said out loud is assumed to be said by your character, unless you have your hand in front of your face. If you are talking to ""the DM"" - asking a question or such - then you raise your hand (don't expect to be called on just raise your hand and talk).  I often DM for a group of ten or more and I like to actively discourage metagaming (this makes it easy to see who is talking aside in busy moments and makes the players feel like they are being ""caught"" doing something dirty when they are called out on it - rather than being defensive about being called out). I also tend to set time limits on activities so they can't plan there way in excruciating detail through simple actions and encourage them to get into character and role play as much as possible. If talking to an NPC (sometimes I even delegate NPCs  to other players - I call in minioning) and they don't have the undivided attention of the DM or of a player character then they are encouraged to point to who they are speaking with in character. I find this is dramatic enough (without the annoyance of announcing ""I am talking to"" or ""my character is saying"" each time) to catch people's attention over the usual chaos of a session even when whispering.  I've found that with large parties, in addition to delegating responsibilities (i.e. here's a book look up the answer to anybody's questions, you be party leader and make decisions for the group, etc.) visual clues are essential."

It's not a bad way to cut down on tabletalk. My current group plays though Roll20 which makes that difficult, and our games always take far too long because we just chat too much. We have fun, but we really could do with cutting down on the jokes a bit.  My favorite way to handle this is to grant everyone the ability to ""call out"" something someone says once a game session. So, the next time someone makes a dumb joke during a serious moment, you can ""call"" them on it and that OOC action actually happens. When used right, it's pretty funny, and it also makes people watch what they say!  Edit: Nevermind, apparently my comment is off topic. Thanks for the downvote, jackass."

dndnext,3e4ex3,Seanathin23,5,Tue Jul 21 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"You're going to hate this answer, but, ""as young as you are comfortable GMing.""  I'd suggest you go older since you say ""I don't want a bunch of snot nosed brats ruining my game."" to me, that implies a bias on your side against younger players and their perceived maturity levels. Right or wrong, YOU don't want younger players (at whatever age you define ""younger"").  I have run a High School club in High School and we had some middle Schoolers join us. Youngest was like 13. We had a blast, all of us.  In college our RPG club had a member who brought his 10 year old every time. Sometimes the kid was cool, sometimes he was disruptive. For him, it was how focused on the game he was playing. He really like games like Hong Kong Action Theater, DBZ, and Champions (his dad made his characters), and Big Eyes Small Mouth. He hated DnD and was usually a ""I just kill it!"" type player. God help us all the time he played MERPs (Middle Earth Role Playing, based on the Rolemaster system).  Right now, I am running Mines of Phandelver for a friend's step kid and her nephew. The Step kid is like 12-13 and seems to be capably understanding, contributing to the roleplay, and having fun. His Nephew is 10 and I am shocked (happily) by his attitude. He is doing great. When the fighter died, he demanded that the rest of the party spend their money raising him and wouldn't let his cousin leave the corpse. ""No! We're a party, and we don't let someone die in a ditch! We're bring him back no matter what!"" At 13 me and my group were rolling our buddy's corpse into a shallow grave, taking his gold teeth, and arguing over his gear.  I'm not joking on the teeth either. The PC had lost a few due to a bad crit and had them replaced with gold falsies. When he died, we had the cleric smash them out with his mace before we tossed a few rocks over his carcass. We were brutal.  So honestly, whether or not younger players are good for your game varies from child to child, but ultimately it is your attitude that really determines the success or failure. Younger players do have attention issues, so as a GM I need to be more active in my descriptions, more clear, and engage them more. I also need to let them fudge their numbers a bit since the 10 year old is not quite speedy with adding his dice totals yet. He's getting there, but he's 10.   Also there's the Table Rating. With a 10 year old, 13 year old, myself (35) and the other adult (30) I need to stop my self from being to... mature. I need to keep the game to PG13 or even PG.   All of that is a lot of work. If you honestly feel that children are too much of a bother, then YOU won't have fun. And then you make them not have fun, and then they don't grow up to be Roleplayers.  So the question for you is:   ""Do you really want to play with children?"" ""How comfortable are you in altering your GM/Play style to accommodate younger players?"" ""At what age do you stop thinking of the younger players as potential nuisances or snot nosed brats, and start thinking of them as players?"" ""What are you trying to get out of playing with younger players?""   That last one is pretty important. If you just need bodies to fill the seats, that's one thing. If you want to attract skilled players (even though they are younger) that's another. But if you are trying to teach new players how to play... well, you might have to go younger than your comfort zone.  I am sorry if this isn't a real answer for you and a lot of vagueness, but that's the best I can do. Based on the way you phrased your question, I would put the limit at 15ish. Maybe allow mature 14 year olds or immature 16 year olds as a cut off, but...  If you could describe your intentions and goals more as well as how YOU feel about the younger players aside from ""snot nosed brats."""

dndnext,3e4ex3,Alex4050,3,Tue Jul 21 22:39:15 2015 UTC,"I did this at my library and allowed ages 12 and up. I expected to rope in a lot of the teens who'd shown interest in it during the school year, but I was running the program in the summer and not a one showed up for the bi-weekly sessions.   What I ended up with was this:   a 12-year-old boy an 18-year-old girl (my sister) a 19-year-old guy two 17-year-old girls two 24-year-old guys a 22-year-old guy   The problem was none of these people showed up for more than one session (and none of them all at once) except for my sister and the 12-year-old boy. And this kid was AWFUL. He came to every single session and, while he grasped the game well enough, he would interrupt every single person's turn and tell them what they should do. Then he'd waste his turn attempting to throw a single piece of hot coal at a Bullywug with his Mage Hand, rather than casting a damaging spell. In the 7 sessions we had throughout the summer, I think we had 2 TPKs, mostly because of this kid. And he would regularly plot against the other players when things actually looked up for the party.   TL;DR: had a 12-year-old boy ruin D&D summer sessions at my library by showing up to every session."

dndnext,3e4ex3,Robservo,2,Tue Jul 21 22:59:02 2015 UTC,+12 In the situation you are describing this is where I would place it. Having done similar events for a number of different systems.  The reasoning is simple. Yes you can get 8 year olds who make great players the problem is weeding them out. Furthermore with kids younger than 12 you often end up with parent supervision which makes for awakward moments at tables. 12 year olds tend to be independant enough that you can reason with and they can understand the table rules properly for the social setting.  I don't know if you have considered this but if you are running a mixed public event be sure you have very clear standards of behavior for your table and include them in your submission. I'm basically talking about what is and isn't acceptable. Swearing should always be off the table. It makes a submission look more polished.

My siblings and I all created characters that we gamed with throughout school too - Dad was a teacher so he would DM games with the local kids while we waited a couple of hours for parents/ busses etc. Never had a problem grasping concepts and was enraptured by the whole game world and story aspects. Dad ran us through very rules light versions - plenty of opportunity for descriptive storytelling without heavy mathematical grind. I tried to emulate his success with my nephews an nieces, however they just couldn't focus - even though they're a similar age to what we all were. Dunno if its on account of the instant gratification mindset due to tv and vidya games etc. ""kids these days"" etc etc, but they just couldn't really imagine the world, create characters etc.  I don't think age is really the factor here, but rather the level of maturity and focus that the kids could bring to the table.  Crazy detail is that the kids my dad DM'd at school were all from lower-income families, and not high performers in school too. It really helped their development he always said."

I have an encounter prepared where the heroes will meet a group of faring folk that asks the heroes to join them since the area is dangerous. After some drinking and partying at night, a hero may wake up to notice an old woman in an old tent that, when approached, will lay the cards for the hero or others.

Describe it as a sword made by a very talented smith who forged the sword using high quality steel so that it would be easier to wield than a normal soldier's sword giving it the extra +1. Have the player give it a name and some kind of history. It belonged to a lieutenant in the dark wars who won some renown with it.

Keep in mind though, 5e doesn't need magic weapons at all really to be balanced.  There is no gap to be bridged.

The DM rolls the modifier in secret and then tells the player afterwards what the staff transformed into the moment it hit/missed. I was going to have the D8 reroll when disadvantage or advantage came into play - forcing advantage bargaining plays from the wielder when they noticed I rolled their bonus twice on an advantage or disadvantage. Hit hard or miss hard.  I'm kinda sad I left the item as extra content on the path I wrote and never handed it out. Still wondering if this item of mine is OP or NP.

If my campaign ever approaches 17th level, I'll probably houserule wish to only the 8th-level and lower spell option.    Anything that likely kills a player character.  Cursed items should have a use and be somehow removable.  The fear of cursed items is a fun emotion with which to toy, but I prefer the risk of death to be reasonably avoidable.    Any wondrous item that is so useful it shows up in every scene.  This could be a broom of flying at low level, or as emperorko pointed out, a cube of force at any level.    Similarly, I prefer to give weapons that are situationally useful, rather than generic upgrades, but I don't think my players share this preference.    Any item that completely negates a racial penalty.  No goggles of night or glasses of sunlight accustomization, unless there's a significant downside.    Like Ironforged said, anything that sets an ability score to a given value.  These negate ability score improvements and encourage ability dumping in a way that I think is not fair."

Same for Elemental, but with the Draconic Bloodline origin. You probably wouldn't need to change much there to get a better/purer elemental feel.  What if the Rebirthed soul wasn't a sorcerer at all? If it were a great warrior or something like that, maybe its soul could fuel your power in a different way?(Just thoughts)"
dndnext,3e3u3s,SolaceKnight,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:08 2015 UTC,I like how these a new ways to refluff the Core Origins. Cursed Origin is a great reskin for a Wild Mage. Elemental Origin is a great reskin for a Dragon Mage. Rebirth could go for either one. You could have the blood of the ancient sorcerer (dragon) or be a reincarnation with side effects (wild).

A feat based around using rational discourse and logic to convince even the most irrational minds. The benefit is using INt instead of CHA for social checks.   Now the player has made a rather large sacrifice but gains a benefit. The same could be said for Dex based Grappling. Perhaps a new monk subclass where the 3rd level feature is the ability to use Dex instead of Str for any athletics check.   Both of these potential features give the player a new way to do something (a more beneficial way), but cost them a resource to do so. Sure the Wizard can use INT for social checks now, but they got that ability INSTEAD of a +2 INT or a nifty feat"

Also the long sword/ shield combo doesn't get to reroll 1s and 2s on damage (which is a big deal when you're talking about 2d6 damage per greatsword swing.)"
dndnext,3e2e9v,winkingchef,2,Tue Jul 21 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  DEX is OP compared to STR. DEX saving throws are more common, DEX has multiple skills (as opposed to just Athletics) and the skill checks are mostly useful (particularly stealth). DEX increases initiative (that one's huge). DEX also increases your AC, and (this one people often forget) it improves how good you are at ranged weapons too. Being able to whip out a longbow or heavy crossbow and do some extra damage at range far outstips the potential that throwing STR-using weapons (javelins or hand-axes) allow. STR does increase the amount of stuff you can carry, but the amount of stuff you would need/want to bring around with you is all dependent on what kind of campaign you are in. The DEX benefits don't have this restriction.  When I said   STR should be good enough so it matches DEX without having to grapple.   I meant it in the way that it should be good enough, in the rules, but it's not. Tbh I still don't think it's good enough even with grapple.  Yes, using a two-handed weapon has a bigger damage output, but that shouldn't be thought of as a benefit of using STR. It's a benefit of using a two-handed weapon - that is to say, the downside of which is that you don't have a free hand for a shield or another weapon. Using STR gives you access to two-handed weapons, the same way that DEX gives you access to ammunition-firing ranged weapons."

dndnext,3e2e9v,st33d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think thrown weapons are the answer.   If you have someone in Light/Medium Armour, with a rapier and shield, compared to someone in Heavy Armour with a longsword/battleaxe/warhammer and shield, their damage output is identical, and they have just 1 AC difference. The DEX player gets a hell of a lot more out of their stat than the STR player does, for my reasons given above. Of course all I'm doing is stating my problem with the current rules without giving a solution - but whatever the solution may be, it should be applicable to the above scenario of the STR sword-and-board compared to the DEX sword-and-board, without either player using extra equipment/weapons.  (As an aside, obviously neither of the above examples can happen at level 1, as the DEX player will need 20 DEX and the STR player will need costly full plate.)  Two things that STR weapons do allow that DEX weapons do not - choice between damage types. Longswords/Battleaxes are slashing, Warhammers are bludgeoning and Warpicks (lol) are piercing - and all are d8s. The first three of those are also versatile - if a player wishes, they can drop their shield and do 1d10 instead of 1d8 damage. With the cost of 2AC, and the gain of just 1 damage per attack, why they would want to is beyond me, but the option is there. For DEX sword-and-boards, they are limited to Rapiers, which are also d8, but exclusively piercing.  The above two things that STR weapons get that DEX weapons do not are trivial, for the reason given above, and also the fact that creatures are so rarely immune/resistant/vulnerable to individual examples of damage types compared to being resistant to all of them, or fire/cold/lightning etc.  DEX sword-and-board becomes even more ridiculous if they gets Medium Armour Master and/or Defensive Duelist. MAM gives him 20 AC, equal to the STR sword-and-board, and Defensive Duelist gives him a melee AC of potentially 27 (if the Defensive fighting style is chosen). And that's without any magical items.   If you compare that to the only feat exclusive to Heavy Armour - Heavy Armour Master - it's pretty useless. A reduction of 3 damage from every hit becomes insignificant later on, and it's only applicable to attacks from non-magical weapons, which themselves become less common."

dndnext,3e1vrv,Atsur,3,Tue Jul 21 17:02:28 2015 UTC,"Preconceived notions go both ways. For exmaple, I feel like very few DnD players know that haflings are shorter than gnomes by six to twelve inches and people just assume gnomes are a few feet tall. But that's because everyone assumes Halflings = Hobbits and Gnomes are from World of Warcraft.  But, I think a lot of people go with the classic cliched routes when playing because as a DM, it's awesome to build this elaborate world but as a player, it just feels like stuff is being changed to change them. Or it feels mechanically like the DM is just making stuff up as they go and are changing things on you (I'm still bitter about the time our DM said HIS gargoyles could go in the sun without issue.)  When you change ONE thing though, it can work wonders because players can attach to that as an initial hook and that's important.  The worst though is when things are changed so much they no longer are what they were. Like when you have a short, mountain dwelling race of miners and call them elves."

Nothing is more intimidating than bureaucracy.   Take humans in the real world. Our ancestors evolved as hunters and gatherers. On an overarching evolutionary timeline, that era was just yesterday. Over the thousands and thousands of years, our bodies have evolved and adapted to the hunter/gatherer lifestyle. The bodies of our species as a whole haven't quite evolved to adapt to the modern lifestyle. It takes thousands, if not, tens of thousands of years.   Now in a fantasy world, orcs likely have roots in savage barbarism. However, give them a few free thinkers, an Age of Enlightenment, an Industrial Revolution, a Religious Awakening, and in a few short centuries their culture can rise from the ashes and begin to resemble a civilized, organized, society.   Their bodies are still strong and hardy because of thousands of years of evolution. But their lifestyle has changed because of the last few hundred years of cultural change. Imagine the martyrs who would have died for the enlightenment of the orc!  Perhaps they learned that too much power bestowed upon one orc leads to despotism and war, so they have divided the government into different bureaus in an attempt to establish checks and balances and keep the peace."
dndnext,3e1vrv,Heliosra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:47 2015 UTC,"Of course, you want to keep alive certain elements of being an orc, otherwise they wouldn't be an orc.  Assuming the change is a recent cultural change, I would keep them physically the same, but change the way they dress and interact. With the bureaucratic orc example, I imagine waistcoats, pocketwatches, tophats and maybe a monocle. They would still be broadchested, big knuckled, and speak through their tusks, but they would speak with an air of enlightenment. Just don't ever insult them and don't ever, ever be late to a meeting.   Of course, the fact that SOME orcs are bureaucrats doesn't mean that ALL orcs should be that way. There could be primitive clans that cling to the old ways. How would the modern orc interact with the primitive tribes? What do they think of each other? Is there conflict, tension?"
dndnext,3e1vrv,VincentGrayson,2,Tue Jul 21 23:54:49 2015 UTC,"My players plane-hop a lot so I get to experiment with new ideas pretty regularly. Currently they're adventuring on a world where elves are basically street-level Daelkyr. They love 'nature', art and magic... but consider all other races to be fodder for their grotesque magical experiments. The world has been twisted and broken in various ways by their influence and most aberrations and monstrosities were created by and remain loyal to the Elves.  As a result most of the other races are more or less allied against the magically and militarily superior Elven kingdoms. Half elves take on the distrusted and rejected-by-society role usually seen by half orcs. Humans and halflings, because they are the slave races most commonly employed by elves, are similarly marginalized. Orcs, Goblinoids and Dwarves comprise the bulk of the sympathetic, civilized races.  Drow society, while extremely chaotic, is relatively good or at least neutral compared to the world's surface elves. The Drow were created by the surface elves to act as wardens of the underdark. Though many of them resent their subservience overall they tend to relate to the surface elves as typical Drow relate to Lloth... worshiping and obeying them in hopes of advancement and in fear of horrific punishments for failure."

I actually kind of like the opportunity of the industrial city with the forest because it doesn't have to work the way you expect it.  Maybe it works because some of the druids have made a deal with some malevolent entities in order to keep this unholy amalgamation of nature and machine working and the players have to unravel this. Maybe the wood is dying and the city isn't really working out, but the druids are doing everything they can to force this because if they don't then war will start.  They know they're just buying time, and then the players can mess with that.

It was fun creating a dwarven society that had basically backed out of all the cliches and was much more akin to the foppish nobles you might expect in a pampered human society, simply because they stopped worrying about digging all the time and exposing themselves to unnecessary danger. The group had a good time with that, including the much hardier dwarven paladin being quite annoyed with the weakling prince who wanted her hand in marriage.  My current campaign world is primarily dominated by humans, so the non-human races basically don't exist, save some half-elves that are treated like dirt, and often slaves. I don't worry too much about cliches, but I also don't really care for non-human races in the first place, so they never play much of a role in my games."

I told a friend when I introduced her to fantasy literature once we (I, I guess) don't like stories because they reinvent the wheel, but because they reinterpret it stylishly. Martin didn't turn dragons on their heads, he just presented them slightly differently. Skyrim too. Skyrim didn't really make orcs opposite their traditions either, just tweaked them.   The antithetical cliches can be just as tired, like we've all said, so lets not think in that direction. What we come up with should still seem logical.

dndnext,3e1vrv,Kiyohara,0,Tue Jul 21 23:00:20 2015 UTC,"Well Elder Scrolls is their own set world with their own set lore and that's at the very least handled a bit differently from Tolkien even if much of the same races are used. Also we're only talking about set interpretations of mythical creatures based almost exclusively on just Tolkien.  Now he based a lot of what he did on research, but he took so many liberties that his finished product don't resemble previous definitions too much.  I love Tolkien's books, but after so many years of the same elves, dwarves, and orcs I just can't stand them anymore.  Gonna agree on the antitheticals though, being different just to be different is predictable and toothless.  Why is it that whenever anyone suggests that maybe not every culture in a race acts the same way people disagree so vehemently, but with humans anything goes?  I'm not saying that all halflings have to act that way, but a country where they came to that conclusion would be fun and interesting.  Everything on that list is off the cuff.

But that's different from trying to think of a new way to imagine, say, how the halflings in the PHB might manifest. Ignoring a portion of a culture to the point that it's against the grain makes something entirely new. Halflings aren't ambitious like that, but maybe there's a subrace -to use 5E workings - that is. That works. This is why everyone's cool with doing weird things with humans, because the entire point of their presented archetype is that they exhibit ""variety in all things"" and no two are alike."

I think it would be fine to just use one of the pre-existing ones.  Heck, if we're talking about changing halflings there's nothing saying that this happened overnight or even of their own volition.  You could have a Sharkey/Saruman situation in which they are forced into a poor situation and violent halflings of questionable morals could be promoted to higher ranks.  The kingdom grew from there and you just had mean haughty halflings based on their upbringing.  No subrace needed in my opinion.

In my campaign, I showed plenty of goblins as cowardly and conniving and generally weak, but one had bigger goals for his kin and allied with the party to start making goblins martially savvy and somewhat ""civilized"". I plan to bring them back as a stable, powerful force in the region that have started trading with human settlements and possibly establishing rule, even as far as commanding bugbears (now that would be a twist) but clashing with hobgoblins who see them as a threat to their ego as well as their power.

Their former empire maintains some influence over the human successor kingdoms by maintaining a monopoly of sorts on magical knowledge and items. Most of those items are recovered from their fallen empire. They were literally ""high elves"", ""cloud elves"", etc.  Dwarves live in great raiding cities under mountains which maintain their economies by delving in the underworld. They slay horrors and guard the entrances to that place and sell off the treasures for money and glory.  Humans are too varied but tend to be fundamentally religious.  Halflings live in a basin and raise hounds which they ride into battle. They border orc tribes, and sometimes the humans forget how badass they are and try to integrate them before getting rekt.

dndnext,3e1vrv,Kangodo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:37:25 2015 UTC,"My game worlds have the following:  High Elves are a heavily militaristic force.  They expand and conquer, and convert their foes into slaves to work their mines, clean their streets, and act as general cannon fodder.  Due to their age and their lack of need to focus on physical labor, high elves often pursue wizardry as a way to expand their power.  Then there's the High Elves that have been controlling the past few human wars behind the scenes, scheming over the past thousand years so that they can conquer the continent themselves.  There's the halflings that survived an apocalypse, and now they live on the surface world as tough hunter-gatherers.  Generations spent fighting scary beasts have honed halflings into deadly stone-hurlers and dangerous stalkers.  Honestly, I don't get sick of things as much as I want to do different things with various races.  I usually portray ""savage"" races in a more positive light, and ""civilized"" races negatively.  Halflings end up being either really scary or non-existent and replaced with three-foot tall anthropomorphic cats.  Dwarves and elves end up working together more often than not, and half-races stop existing.  Of course, just because a race has tendencies doesn't mean that they lack individual cultures.  North March orcs are usually different in organization, level of civilization, and demeanor than East March orcs, for instance.

Druid (Circle of the Land) - Circle of the Moon casts a large shadow, but really the Circle of the Land has a few uninspired features.  Its capstone feature makes Beasts and Plants avoid hitting you and you gain it at level 14, but the highest CR plant/beast in the Monster Manual is CR 9. Fighter (Champion) - Mechanically very weak.  Battlemaster takes a bit more thought to play but ends up better in many ways. Ranger (Beast Master) - The concept is great but there's no good way to put a full pet into combat with hit points, defenses, and steady offense without that being broken.  The result is a pet that can do some things but ultimately feels unsatisfying to many players. Sorcerer (Wild Magic) - Another cool concept but the ""power"" of the archetype is getting lots of ""free"" rerolls and those depend on the GM rolling on the Wild Magic table.  If you don't have a GM who will work with you here then you're going to feel pretty underwhelmed at the end of the day."

Way, way, long ago, when I had to ride dinosaurs uphill both ways in the snow to get to games, the fighter was the simplest character type for a completely new person to play.  You had a low AC and a low THAC0 too and you rolled one dice to hit and a different dice for damage and engaged in discussion as you wanted (sometimes not at all).  For many players, the fighter was the introduction, and many decided to try something more complex, like a spellcaster or paladin.  I see the champion as that ""introductory"" archetype.  There is not a lot of complexity (aside from choosing feats, but you have a few levels before you need to do that).  You put out steady damage, you are tough, and you don't need a complex plan.  It allows you to observe how the game is played while still contributing without poring over the minutiae of your class.  Personally, I would choose the Battle Master because all those maneuvers give so many options, but were I new, I might like to start with Champion.  Learn the system, then start building more complex characters.  So while I personally think the Champion is a little dull, I think it is balanced and serves a role both within the game and as an ambassador of the game."

Maybe war cleric? Though ironically I really like war clerics. But their abilities seem kind of pointless. Their capstone is cool but not that cool. Helps with concentration I guess. Otherwise nothing helps them rly cast and they can't realy be good martial combatants so idk.   Honestly assassins have kind of useless abilities in a primarily team campaign. In the right campaign they are great but a lot of it is more contingent on your party hanging out and you doing stuff. Idk if that counts but I just feel like the concept is slightly flawed. It might be more that I just don't like popular perception of assassin as the MMO style rogue. But I do think the class is well designed thematically so what do I know.  Also I want to call out transmuter wizards as being kind of lackluster. I feel like every other thing is a little specific and you kind of know if you're going to be an enchanter or an illusionist or a necromancer or not or it's just really powerful like diviner or evoker or conjurer.

If the target is surprised you won't provoke an attack of opportunity because they can't use reactions until after they skip their first turn.  Getting surprise is hard, getting surprise on a whole group is harder, ensuring you go before all of them in initiative is very hard."
dndnext,3e43lf,Ironforged,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah assassins aren't great team players.  Picking up expertise and cunning action won't hurt per se but it would almost be better just to have more levels of fighter, knock someone prone with trip attack and then wail on them or whatever.  As is you would optimally want to go fighter 5 for second attack before dipping into rogue so you won't have this up and running until 8 really by which your campaign could already be over.  But the GOOD news is that if you wait until fighter 5 you'll have a good sense of if you think the dip is worth it at that point (or going fighter 8) and getting 2 feats and a 7th level ability instead of rogue 3.   Alternatively you could go fighter 4 which you need for great weapon master then tech to rogue 3 but that's barely better and you lose a few levels of not having a second attack.  Fighter 2 rogue 3 sucks and using a maul would basically be gimping yourself at that point versus having your sneak attack damage I would think and anyway you wouldn't have great weapon master.  I'm just rambling at this point."
dndnext,3e43lf,ptsdemon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:13 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of going Fighter 1 or even 2, then taking a single level of rogue mainly for the expertise + extra skill, then taking fighter till 5, then two more rogue. So yes, it comes online fully at lvl 8."

dndnext,3e43lf,Avex4,2,Tue Jul 21 21:47:19 2015 UTC,looks okay besides the action surge which just gives you one more action. I don't like that you dip into rogue for 3 full levels just to get POTENTIAL bonus damage on one round in combat (you definitely aren't always going to go first or get the drop on people) and you don't even get the sneak attack with the maul since it's heavy which kinda sucks but your damage is still... alright. Flavor is cool though so +1
dndnext,3e43lf,SirPeebles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"You should take swashbuckler. RAW i can see an arguement for being able to sneak attack with a 2h weapon as a swashbuckler, because it says nothing about still requiring a finesse/ranged weapon. RAI i think  its pretty clear they want you to duel wield, but the way the text reads i can see being able to sneak attack with any weapon.  The rogue levels will also give you an excellent use of your bonus action most turns if you dont proc great weapon master.  Also while your build clearly focuses on using GWM and a maul i think the rapier+sheild and dueling style will come out better due to being able to apply sneak attack and focus on dex.  1d8+2 isnt that much worse than 2d6(rerolls) and lets you apply a bonus 2d6 extra damage per turn."

That seems to me to be a rather insufficiently described ability, so GM can be expected to make boundaries up.  Any limits from previous editions aren't really relevant except a DM may want to draw on them to fill in the blanks.  But note that nothing in the description says you gain any abilities of creature you impersonate.  So no flying, no extra actions just because you look like a Thri-Kreen (those are really defined as ""humanoid?)."
dndnext,3e3r86,jwbjerk,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm working from the UA Eberron article, and I get that the shapechange isn't intended to provide a mechanical benefit, no breathing under water as a merman, no flight as an Aarakocra, I was just curious if there was precedent from the earlier editions that might be helpful.

If you only saw Bob the outhouse digger I'd say you can only look like him.  If you've seen a few different humans then you can mix their features to become a generic human.  Basically you need to actually have an idea of what a generic human would look like before you can become that.  Your ability isn't to shapechange into random races; it seems like you have complete control over this.  Secondly?  I'm leaning towards no for the Aarakocra.  Or if I let you fly you would not be nearly as good as a natural born Aarakocra (I'd treat it like a concentration spell; on damage you check or fall) I also definitely wouldn't give you the fly by attack ability (assuming you could fly at all).  The Thri-keen?  You have extra arms and while you can hold stuff in all four you can't really use them independently of each other.  In practice you can only really ""focus"" on two at once specifically or treat them in pairs.  There would be no in combat benefit of this.  I'd give you the articulation in the legs, but make you practice for a bit first to actually get walking down.  Think about walking on stilts or in heels the first time (everyone has tried on heels at least once, right?)  Basically the goal is for you to have the flavor of shapechanging all you want, without actually conferring any sort of mechanical benefit."
dndnext,3e3r86,glumlord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:59 2015 UTC,Some of these issues sort of resolve themselves.  Aarakocra are super rare and don't engage with outsiders often.  Thrikreen don't even exist in Forgotten Realms or Eberron I don't think.

I actually feel it fits the flavor text of summoning better anyway as summons are often random and even risky in most fantasy settings. The more important problem of players abusing rules is solved as well. A random table is indeed the way I will go as the DM is also not supposed to abuse rules or apply bias which many do. Not offering a pixie because the DM doesn't like them should equally not be allowed.

DM realized only after the druid had died that he was allowing some shenanigans by not reading the spell correctly - the caster doesn't just have some extra bodies to control, they have to order the summoned creatures around (druid had at one point turned into a giant bat and flown away, but was still controlling a pair of monsters tactically fighting down below), and the caster also doesn't have complete control over what gets summoned."

The spell could use some clarification on the Intelligence of the conjured animals, since they are fey spirits and not the actual animals.  My though has been that it is like Find Steed, as there too it's not a real animal but actually fey, and has an Int of 6.  Based on that, it can understand and obey verbal commands, but should not be employing complex tactics in combat.

The ruling would make more sense if they actually released Monster and Animal Summoning Tables like they used to have (where you would just roll randomly for what appeared).    But this requires the DM to have memorized creatures at every CR level in order to make an on the spot ruling... which likely means that 99% of DMs will just defer to the player's choice.    What it DOES allow is a basis for the DM to deny a player's choice when it is viewed as ridiculous/abusive (e.g., army of pixies).

dndnext,3dyxs9,Intuentis,5,Mon Jul 20 18:50:34 2015 UTC,Your DM is likely to AT LEAST meet you halfway on this (if they're adhering to the crucial idea that the DM be a fan of the PC's and not their explicit antagonist). The DM should be finding ways to both indulge and challenge (sometimes these are the same thing). This ruling enables that while limiting typical player abuse of the spell.

I totally agree that that would be a bummer.  I prefer getting to choose versus random tables.  And if the abuses this leeway, that's even worse than random dice!  I'd also note though that it would make zero sense for a DM to veto a choice under Conjure Animals IMO since the spell specifically states it isn't summoning actual animals, but just ""fey spirits that take the form of beasts"".  So the DM argument of ""oh there were no horses nearby"" would make zero sense.  And the argument ""oh they didn't feel like looking like horses"" is equally eyebrow-raising.    Whereas with some of the others (e.g., Celestial, Woodland Beings, Fey) you're actually conjuring the actual being, so there I could perhaps see the DM having a bit more leeway.  Though if he always only gives you 8 blink dogs for Woodland Beings, that's a crappy use of a 4th level spell slot..."
dndnext,3dyxs9,dethpot8o,2,Mon Jul 20 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the DM isn't vetoing your choice, because the player isn't making a choice at all now.

dndnext,3dyxs9,Intuentis,5,Mon Jul 20 19:02:27 2015 UTC,They specifically mention the player may express a preference.

Each to their own, though. I suspect that each table will handle the degree of control the player gets differently, so hopefully everyone will be able to come to an interpretation that fits their group."
dndnext,3dyxs9,Intuentis,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:34 2015 UTC,There are plenty of spells that gives more control to the players.

If the DM is experienced, then the ruling puts them in an awkward position where allowing or disallowing the Druid's preferred choice is based on whether or not they can trust the Druid to not pick an animal that'll fuck over their encounter, and whether or not the DM wants to be a dick to the Druid by disallowing it.  If the DM is a newbie, then there's very little guidance on how they should approach this statement that lets them ban a particular animal from being summoned. They're probably going to default to ""I don't know any better, so I'll just let the Druid have whatever they wanted to have"". And if the Druid keeps using things that, in the table's opinion, keeps screwing over the DM's encounter flow, then they can talk it over and come to a compromise, which is supposed to be how tabletop RPG's work.

There is no listing of creatures, no random rolling table, no general recommendations for ""hey, if the Druid wants to summon a flock of moose, take care that this doesn't throw the balance of the encounter completely off!""  Which circles us back to my original point that the only way the DM will know what creatures ""are appropriate for the campaign and that will be fun to introduce"" will be through ... actually playing the game, but the implication that the DM would block any scene-stealing summons is already part of the general assumption of what goes on in a tabletop RPG!"

Any Action or Bonus Action taken by a PC during their turn is technically expending a resource. The actual effect takes place by using that resource, but the resource itself has no restriction on how or when its effect occurs. Taking an attack with the Extra Attack class feature means that the character may attack twice (in the case of the Monk) when taking the attack action. Using Flurry of Blows requires the player to take the attack action and spend 1 Ki Point to attack twice with unarmed strikes with their bonus action.  Once the Monk spends both their action to attack and their bonus action to use Flurry of Blows, then they can explain the attacks and who those attacks hit through whatever narrative they want. Attacks can be broken up with movement (making the Mobile feat hugely beneficial to pretty much any class but especially Monks and control-centric Fighters) and there's nothing to say that Action: Attack must complete before Bonus Action: Flurry of Blows can start. Along the same lines, the weapon used for an attack while two-weapon fighting isn't specified for any attack except the bonus action attack.

So the pattern would be:   Attack action to make 1 attack roll Spend 1 Ki point to activate Flurry of Blows Flurry of Blows Bonus Action to make 2 attack rolls (using your unarmed strike)   If you're level 5 or higher, then step 1 means you get to make 2 attack rolls in that step, or 4 attack rolls total: 2 from the Attack action and 2 from Flurry of Blows, but the second Attack roll from step does not allow you to trigger Flurry of Blows a second time.

But personally, I would feel like dead weight being a character focused on 'boxing"" or ""grappling"" with the way fists work if I was not a monk."

dndnext,3dyxs9,Unwyrden,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:18 2015 UTC,"I started this off by saying I dislike how the game requires you to have a feat or specific class to change the way unarmed strikes function. So that wasn't very helpful. Other than saying ""well wait until level 4 if you're not a variant human"" or ""talk to your DM to house rule the feat level 1 with some sort of sacrifice on your end.""  The point is you're always doing min amounts of damage unless you take the feat or are a monk. Which would ruin the expected DPS of the party.  This is not one of those requests to do something that is game breaking. This is simply saying I feel that all players should be dealing 1d4 + str mod  on unarmed strikes.  As a DM, I would have no problem with someone wanting to do a barbarian boxer type character, rather than a monk boxer, & giving that person 1d4 + str mod. Then if they take the feat. 1d6 + str mod. They would typically be dealing more damage with most other weapons available. There would be no balance issues, other than a slightly lower DPS output."

Actively watching for openings would be, I'd say, a Ready action to attack the target. An opportunity attack isn't actively watching for openings, it's reacting to an opening you weren't expecting. If you haven't readied an action, you're not actively watching the target for any opening they may make, you're watching everybody in sight to see if they're coming after you, what they're doing, who they're fighting, and how the fight is going, whether your allies need your help, and so on. A battle is a big, chaotic thing, and you're not watching one person like a hawk the entire time unless you specifically devote yourself to doing so.   then it's easy to strike within the few seconds it would take to have a creature move out of a 5- or 10-foot radius around me.   It may take them a few seconds to move, but the opportunity attack isn't coming in those few seconds, it's coming in the one instant that they take their attention off of you to look where they're going. Literally a glance's worth of time for you to make your strike, and only after you've noticed that opening amid all the other chaotic action of combat."

You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.   That sounds pretty active to me. Also, it's definitely not just the one instant when they take their attention off of you. They could circle all the way around you while still in that 5-foot bubble in or to try and get passed you (and given they way initiative order goes, you only have to watch 1 creature at a time).

In the end, though, it doesn't really matter, there's no reason to try to get this detailed. It's a way to explain why the rule is there. We're not trying to model real-world combat one-for-one here, it's meant to give us enough rules to adjudicate combat and get on with the game. We have rules that work in the abstract, and that we can easily explain with a few sentences and a willingness to just accept that sometimes a quick explanation that lets us get to the game is better than spending hours on end trying to argue about every little detail of who's looking where, and when, and what that allows them to do at any given moment.  There's nothing wrong with wanting a fine-tuned detailed engine to attempt to model real-world combat down to the smallest details... but D&D will never be that engine.

What matters is the chance to actually roll higher:   For a 1d6 that's 33.33%, rather low. For a 1d8 that's 37.5% A 1d10 even has a 40% chance. The best is the Barbarian, with his 1d12 and their 41.67% chance to roll higher.   So it really depends on how much damage you get and what your current life total is.

dndnext,3e3iv8,HebrewHammer16,3,Tue Jul 21 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this. You're just throwing off combat the other way by shifting the average hitpoints up - and it hardly fixes the problem. The DM then needs to scale up the encounters to make them challenging, and the people who rolled average are still hosed compared to the people who rolled very well.  The entire point of rolling for HP is taking a gamble. If players aren't willing to take the gamble on getting screwed over on HP (which I agree isn't very fun), then you might as well just take the average.   You could largely help this by coming up with a different rolling scheme than ""1dX"". For example, instead of rolling a 1d8, use 2d4. It has a similar average value, but a higher minimum, and is more consistent so you are less likely to get totally hosed or very heavily rewarded by unlucky/lucky rolls"
dndnext,3e3iv8,ademonicspoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"In terms of throwing off combat, those small differences in hit points can go along way to keeping someone from getting killed outright.  6 hit points against a monster that does as little as 1d4+2 could drop you to zero in one turn and leave you on the verge of death.   The more hit points you have, the more forgiving an enemy's attack is because you have a much larger range of options that don't kill you.   While ending up with more hit points could require some reworking by the GM, it's far less likely to result in a flat out death. And if everyone takes the average you end up with far less disparity. Imagine your Wizard rolls and gets +2 hit points at lvl 2 while the Fighter gets +10. In order to challenge the Fighter you might boost the damage dice of the enemy which could make the Wizard an instakill if you ever hit them."
dndnext,3e3iv8,Bohrdumb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:13 2015 UTC,Raising hitpoints doesn't make death any less likely unless the DM doesn't also scale encounters up to account for the raised hitpoints.  If the DM wants easier encounters then you might as well just skip the middleman and make the encounters easier.
dndnext,3e3iv8,ademonicspoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:53 2015 UTC,"It actually does make death less likely. It's all about the possible ranges for rolling. If one of my players has 7 hp because they rolled crap, and my other two players have 15 hp taking the average do I risk putting a mob out there that could flatten that weak 7hp hero?  What if the low end and the high end got rolled so I've got a 7, 15, and 21 HP character? How much damage do I shoot for? If I want to make it challenging for that 21 I risk building an encounter that will crush the 7 hp in one swing.   By having players roll hit points you create a wider range of hit points that makes it harder to balance and encounter and more likely that someone will die.  So if I let my players all have slightly higher hitpoints and put them up against a mob doing 2d6+5 damage, that could flatten someone at 17 hit points, but it's much less likely to do the max damage than 1d6+5 against someone with a smaller pool of hp."

Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).   Same section as picking class features and gaining ability score increases.  Just like how the DM isn't in charge by RAW of where you put your ASI, by the book he isn't in charge on how you determine to increase your hit points.  Also every class entry is listed like this.   Hit Points at Higher Levels:  1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st   So obviously it is the player's choice by default, yes because of people playing older editions of the game where fixed was only an option in the DMG (3rd edition), always rolled for early levels but got a fixed amount at higher levels (2e and older), or always a fixed amount (4e), most tables gravitate towards what they are use to but like many things 5e is different from older editions."

Why wouldn't it be up to the DM to decide whether to roll or take default this time? As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't specify who at all.

Put something in the road to block the parties travel, or hinders it. Something like destroying a bridge.  Have many hobgoblins hiding in brush all spread out at long range.   Traps set between the ranged hobgoblins and the party. Spike pit, snakes, nets anything really.  A second party of the beefier hobs following them to cut off their escape riding wargs.  Hobgoblins are scary. Not because they're really strong, but because theyre smart and the prepare. When your planning the encounter if you think huh they might win this they probably wouldnt go through with that plan.  This is at least assuming the hobgoblins know what the party is capable of. Thats the biggest deciding factor of how hard this encounter will be. If they know everything about the pcs and have enough resources the pcs will lose.  I would suggest beating the party and not killing them, but do something like capture them and have the hobgoblins sell them off as slaves. Get a cool escape scenario out of it, and then a revenge and getting their possession back story they get to plan.   Defeating something you once lost to is a great feeling."

It's all about staying in formation, and sending them out in teams of 2-3 to act as line-breakers, and applying pressure where the party really doesn't want it.

Say a bridge crossing where there is a ditch filled with pitch on the far end which is lit on fire once the victimes are in the middle of the bridge. A group of hobgoblins who form up with pikes and shields behind the victims and push them into the flames. Archers on the river banks and behind the burning ditch who pick of anyone who jumps into the water or attempts to flee through the flames.  On top of this they would probably have prepared a fallback position to rendvousz at and defend themselves if the victims counterattack successfully.  If they wouldnt have had time for all these preparatiosn just start omitting details from the preparations depending on how hasty they had to be. Honestly, if they are too strapped for time i would say they put of the ambush and wait for a better place and time (unless they have no choice but do it right away).

Being mounted on other combatants, the hobgoblins were able to utilize their Martial Advantage to full effect.  Several others hung back to apply ranged fire, with runners leaving the combat periodically to report the engagement further up the martial chain."
dndnext,3e1c0r,Dongaloid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:40 2015 UTC,"Here's how I do it...   Scouting Is Excellent - Hobs don't rush, they properly ambush.  Hob scout gets eyes on PC's, they do NOT engage.  They drop to stealth, go slow, as their immediate mission is alerting command.  This means, there are rarely ""found by a few hob"" encounters and usually ""infrequent run-ins with a tactically large bands of them"". Diversity Counts - Hobs will not be 9 guys with swords.  They will be 5 melee combatants (I prefer pole-arms to flavor up more unit-based combat), 3 crossbow/ranged combatants hidden and spread around, and then a commander and/or red hand (magic user, focus on militarily useful spells over just Evocation... Divination magic can advantage a lot of people, Abjuration, etc.).  They work as a unit. Pressure Points - PC's have clear and evident (most of the time) tactical pressure points and hobs are born soldiers and tacticians.  PCs tend to draw their best weapon (magic, their specialty weapon, etc.), they tend to look their part (an educated man could tell the difference between the barbarian and the wizard easily), and they tend to go for Damage rather than Conditions when in combat.  Hobs are the opposite and it makes them tougher to fight, disarm and disable first.  They have balanced weapon specialities and aren't one-weapon ponies.  They all look much alike on purpose (to confound enemy targeting).  They are Conditional fighters by and large.  Example:  Three hobs rush a PC, they don't just attack three times--One may trip, the second to grapple the combatant while prone, and the third to advantaged attack; repeat until very dead.  Alchemical items that induce blindness.  Restraint.  Fear.  Etc.  Disrupt the opponent's optimal (and tired) tactics, make them do what they are not designed for (sub-optimal combat).  Have many melee hobs rush past the melee fighters and swarm the Wizard, taking the caster down brutally and efficiently, until he's on his back, bleeding, 1 failed death save from properly dead, and have the Hob commander give the order that if everyone doesn't drop their weapons, his men (at least one of whom is going to go before the PC's next turn) will kill the wizard.  Make them realize that the hobs won't be there to just fight and fight, they're there to win and there are many ways to win.   I like my hobs to ambush with the full intent to kill.  None of them leave a breathing enemy on the ground.  A PC drops, they'll catch spearpoints in their chest until enough Death Saves auto-fail that they're gone.  The ambush uses as many militarily smart moves as possible.  Do they have a wagon or mounts?  Run them off, kill or hobble them.  Leave the PC's on foot, unable to carry their hundreds of pounds of gear.  Hobs run when a fight is unwinnable, rally, and come back.  It always should feel like when you run into Hobs that unless you straight up just surrender and give them what they want (which is always something that's an early option, they're not murderers or criminals), then you're in for days and weeks of skirmishes, reinforcements, and warfare by the best of the best."

dndnext,3dzvsq,NobleAmberDragon,2,Tue Jul 21 04:42:37 2015 UTC,"Depends. Is it useful in your game to be able to go to other planes of existence? Do you have a character with at least 20 Intelligence so that you have reasonable odds of actually getting the thing to take you where you want? Then maybe. Otherwise, probably not.  Now, if you want to consider ways to abuse the item, then we might be able to do better than an unreliable unlimited teleport item. While the successful usage of the amulet replicates plane shift (and therefore needs the targets to be willing and holding hands), the failure mode targets all creatures and objects within 15 feet, no save. If you and your posse wanted to get a boss monster by itself away from its lair and henchmen, rushing it and intentionally failing the check might be a plausible strategy.  But if you're talking about non-cheese uses, then it's only as valuable as (unreliable) planar travel in your setting. The planes aren't necessarily a useful place to go to in general, and are likely quite dangerous prior to around the level you'd get access to plane shift anyway."

Most people don't realize how easy Exhaustion is to overcome.  Exhaustion level 1 - Disadvantage on skill checks.  You're a Barbarian so you're probably not making too many of those outside Athletics and Initiative.  Athletics you can gain advantage on while raging and you get a class feature that gives you advantage on initiative rolls.  This Exhaustion level is entirely negated by class features.  Exhaustion level 2 - Half speed.  This would mean more to a class that didn't have Fast Movement as a class feature.  It's not wholly negated but it's somewhat offset.  Even then it's not a big deal.  Most combat features people running at you and then a lot of standing still swinging back and forth.    Exhaustion level 3 - Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.  You don't want to be here.  If you're looking at the ""Final boss"" then you might Frenzy that 3rd time to get that extra ""oomph"" because it's now or never, but otherwise you stop at 2.

That said, I don't think the OP's suggestion is workable, because unless your barbarian is on death's doorstep, you pretty much always want to use Reckless Attack -- the barbarian excels at trading blows."
dndnext,3e48xt,Safidx,2,Tue Jul 21 21:06:38 2015 UTC,"Well, you could save Frenzy for the important fights?  Sure you can do it all the time, but after 6 Frenzies you are dead."
dndnext,3e48xt,Kangodo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:49 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that's also another reason why frenzy is not-so-great -- you either barely use it or you become so crippled that you're worthless.

dndnext,3dzt0j,polyphaeon,12,Mon Jul 20 21:25:46 2015 UTC,"Canonically, the argument could be made that only humans have the biological ability to breed half breeds I guess? In my games I let players be anything, we'd just put together some house rules for the exact race."
dndnext,3dzt0j,HebrewHammer16,13,Mon Jul 20 21:29:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The races are genetically diverse and I'm sure most combinations wouldn't be sexually or genetically compatible.   To illustrate: A horse/donkey hybrid is a mule. A tiger/lion hybrid is a liger (they exist in captivity). Mules and ligers are infertile.  But if you take a donkey and try to mix it with a tiger, then you make a tiger who is no longer hungry."

dndnext,3dzt0j,captaindaximus,2,Mon Jul 20 23:26:01 2015 UTC,"I would try looking at it from an evolutionary perspective. All races are related if you go back far enough. Tolkien lore confirms that orcs descended from the Elves. Human might also share a common ancestor with the Elves. These three races are close enough genetically to interbreed, although their offspring would be infertile. BAM! Half-orcs and Half-elves. I guess that opens up the possibility of Orc/Elves if the situation was right.  Regarding the rest of the races, their common ancestors stretch so far back that they have evolved into separate species that are incapable of producing offspring."
dndnext,3dzt0j,Cyclenophus,3,Mon Jul 20 23:34:40 2015 UTC,"If we go by LOTR lore then.... Humans, dwarves and elves are all independent creations (I think Eru made Humans and elves and some angel made dwarves). Hobbits are 'like-humans' or some such and orcs are corrupted elves. So, if anything there should only be human/hobbits and orc/elves.  If we go with a single origin evolutionary framework you will inevitably end up with the different races having varying levels of relatedness and only one sister species to humans. So, for example, let's say that hobbits humans and elves all share a common ancestor and that humans and elves are more closely related. In this case elves and humans would be the same evolutionary distance from hobbits and theoretically should both be able to interbreed just as well.  edit: oh god, it is a rabbit hole: http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/10102/how-would-multi-race-humanoid-evolution-happen"

If I allowed halfbreeds to procrate, I'd probably allow them to interbreed even more. Half-Orc+Half-Elf? I'd just flavour the offspring with a different look, then have them use either the Half-Elf or Half-Orc template. Unless we used the DMG guidelines to creating a new race."

Well kinda- I said that a lot of the common races could breed but the child often would just appear to be the mother's race. So a Gnome woman and a Dwarf man get together and she has a gnome baby. The actual half races are notable because they break that rule.

dndnext,3dzt0j,ademonicspoon,5,Mon Jul 20 23:17:14 2015 UTC,Because D&D is still influenced by Tolkien.
dndnext,3dzt0j,WeylandTheDwarf,3,Tue Jul 21 11:50:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is the reason.  1st Edition (along with Unearthed Arcana) allowed players to be humans,elves,dwarves,halflings(i.e. hobbits), half-elves, half-orcs and gnomes.   Half-elves and half-orcs are references in Lord of the Rings.  (I think its either that hinted that the hill men that join Saurumon have been been breeding with orcs or that the Urak-Hai have been mixed with human blood).     Gnomes were the only PC race in 1st and 2nd edition that weren't taken from Tolkien.  As others mentioned Dark Sun introduced the human-dwarf hybrids.   But I don't think any lore has made other half-races stick in the collective imagination enough to get any other mixing of races into official cannon."
dndnext,3dzt0j,jmartkdr,6,Tue Jul 21 14:21:11 2015 UTC,"Because:   Per the ""standard"" lore in most settings, humans are the most likely to build big empires and interact frequently with other races, thus making a half human/half elf more common than a half elf/half dwarf.  If you dedicated a couple of pages to each possible multi-race combination, the PHB would be almost nothing but races."
dndnext,3dzt0j,WeylandTheDwarf,2,Mon Jul 20 21:30:44 2015 UTC,"makes sense I guess, but I still don't see why you wouldn't find at least some interspecies half breeds in busy commerce towns.   As for #2 I hear you there but there is no reason to list all of them."

Sure, but the fact that (assuming interbreeding between these races is even possible) they could potentially show up does not mean they deserve to be a player race in the PHB.    As for #2 I hear you there but there is no reason to list all of them.   Yes, but without expanding the size of the PHB considerably, you'd need to take something else out. Which race in the PHB would you remove in order to make room for half orc/half dwarf? What thematic niche does a half orc/half dwarf fulfill that is not already done by the existing races in the PHB?"
dndnext,3dzt0j,WeylandTheDwarf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:09 2015 UTC,Why couldn't you simply have a single page that explains multi-racing similar to the way they have multi-classing?
dndnext,3dzt0j,ademonicspoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you could multi-race that easily in DnD though, as races don't have levels.  So you'd need to have a section for every race that explains what the half-version does, which would add several pages, and possibly not work well (do half-dwarves get weapons training? How do you work in a +.5 ability bonus?)  It's book real estate, and only really useful to a few kinds of players: people who've been playing long enough to feel that all of the existing races (and there's a lot of them) are played out (though most of those could knock out a homebrew in a half hour), minimaxers looking to get just the right ability mods for the best possible damage, and the sort of player who can't play anything out of the book because they need to be ""special"" (note: these players always play the same character, in my experience, and it's someone with no personality).  Any of these would be better served by a freeform race-creation system than a list of half-race mechanics. That system should probably sit in the DMG, though, as an optional rule."
dndnext,3dzt0j,WeylandTheDwarf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"I'd estimate 1/3 of a column per race. Subraces don't be considered because it could be ruled that only the main race counts. Have an additional half a page explaining overlapping abilities. It could be as simple as double darkvision gives enhanced darkvision, etc etc. For weapon proficiencies, I'd remove half the weapons from each list and ensure no overlapping. For armor proficiencies, double proficiency with a given armor type gives proficiency in the next heavier class. It doesn't have to be as complicated as people need to make it out to be. Granted, my example above would take 2 pages rather then the 1 page I originally thought but I believe that still to have a minimal impact on the books length."
dndnext,3dzt0j,t0beyeus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"Races aren't designed such that you can just take some abilities of one, some other abilities from another, throw them together and have something thematic and balanced.   To do a half-race properly, you need to make it its own thing - e.g. half-elves.   Multiclassing isn't a good example because multiclassing is a very janky part of the system that in my opinion only deserves to exist to shore up gaps where existing single classes don't fit the bill. It's usually better to have a dedicated archetype or alternate class feature instead of multiclassing. That's why we have paladins and not just fighter/clerics.  Except that kind of system isn't needed for races. Races are really, really easy to homebrew compared to classes - if you want a half-X, it's easier just to do that then rely on some hacky multi-race system."

Non-optimizers would end up with underpowered characters because they chose to multi-race for flavor reasons penalized for fear of making optimization with multi-racing too strong.   Furthermore,   -You can't roll half-orcs into this system without adding full orcs as a race  -Both half-orcs and half-elves have really cool, unique features and they would both be much less interesting if they were just a hodgepodge of human/orc/elf features."

dndnext,3dzt0j,Jaded_Jackalope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:34 2015 UTC,"I've always thought of it as genetic drift.  Everyone started off as human.  Through isolation (and maybe magic), some populations began to show distinct characteristics.  Some became short and powerfully built.  We called them Dwarves.  Others went tall and slender, and developed long life and some odd extra abilities and an affinity to magic.  We called them Elves.    Still others grew very large and brutish, even to the point of having as much of a snout as a proper jaw, complete with tusks.  We called those Orcs.  Some of the Orcs split off again and grew to be actual Giants.  Still others shrank and became little people, nearly half of the size of regular humans.  They weren't Dwarves, because they were proportioned just like humans, so we called them Halflings.    The thing is, since they are all basically variants of human physiology, they can interbreed with humans, more or less.   The offspring of the union is almost always sterile, like a mule.  And, since they have drifted in different directions, they are genetically far enough apart that interbreeding between, say, an Elf and a Dwarf, if such a thing would ever happen given their dislike for each other, would not produce a viable child.  There is no one who knows how the Tieflings and the Half-dragons came about, however.  The union between humans and dragons.... should not ever be able to produce an offspring.  But, the fact that such beings do exist is undeniable.  Magic is clearly at play, here, or at least has been some time in the past.  The same thing goes with Tieflings. Once can only imagine how such a union could be.  Certainly, no Tiefling has ever had a child with a human, not that has been recorded in the medical journals, anyway.  It's just not possible."

You can cast Plane Shift with it, but if your group isn't familiar with any locations on any other planes of existence (and most 8th level adventurers would not)... the spell does nothing. If you read about one, you may be able to go for it - but a failure could mean you get teleported directly into the deep layers of The Abyss, surrounded by monsters well beyond your comprehension, let alone ability to fight - effectively, it's a TPK.  It could be used for fast travel if they do know of at least 1 location on another plane, but it requires 2x DC 15 checks to make it, with a random luck roll (60% chance to end up on the same plane, 40% chance to end up anywhere in the multiverse) to avoid ending up somewhere you may very much NOT want to be.  You can't jump from one place on the material plane to another (it specifically says another plane), so you would need to try over and over again until you succeed twice - each time with that risk of failure, then rolling a 61-100, and causing you to potentially end up in a very bad place.  From a DM perspective, If your campaign calls for a lot of plane hopping, it works well. If they're trying to jump around constantly, you may put them up against a very tough encounter at some point (but you probably wouldn't actually send a level 8 party into the middle of Thanatos surrounded by 5 lich lords)."

Take college of Valor and you can give him extra damage with your bardic inspiration dice. By level 6 you can grapple and shove prone in a single turn.  Hold Person is a good 2nd level spell choice; paralyzed gets you autocrits when you hit and advantage which helps you hit.

When you can get it, haste is probably the strongest raw damage buff you can get, and it pairs well with the barbarian rage (also paladin smites and blade warlock's lifedrinker).

With mostly squishy casters, this fight has a good chance of killing your party.  That being said, if your party members are particularly hardy/lucky, you might be able to use this as is.  Just using some basic math, the boss has the ability to do 3 attacks per turn (assuming he uses the Legendary for an attack) with a total of 3d6+6 damage (average of 16 damage) while human.  This is enough to one-shot a Wizard who has no Con mod and only took the average listed HP/level.  This only gets worse when he can cast spells as that he can cast up to 6 burning hands spells which could hit more than one target for 3d6 each (4d6 on the two casts at 2nd level).  Then there's the part where he summons the Earth Elementals.  While it is possible to take on 3 of them, they will do significant amounts of damage and deplete spell slots to get rid of in a timely manner.  None of which is impossible, but it will make this significantly harder.  I like a lot of the utility actions that you have for the Legendary actions, but I would suggest removing the attack option as without it, he shouldn't be able to just drop the Wizard in a single round.  In addition, I would suggest staggering the appearance of the Earth Elementals so that they can't just overwhelm the party.

I'd handle it like they hear about this exotic bird in the area, find a trail of feathers you've been plucking from yourself and follow it. They realize you're sentient and care (if a good party) or want to capture you for themselves (if evil) and so try to free you. If good they make a friend, if bad they only let you out after you promise a year's service to their party.   It's a neat little story, could be done as a one-shot and would give your party a reason to work and stay together.   Plus, DM can say you plucked some key feathers needed for flight and possibly restrict that in a light way so you can't abuse it too much but you still get the advantages of flight and such.

There's a reason pointbuy starts at 8 and Array has an 8, you're expected to have a negative modifier and they expect you to have a +3 at most, perhaps even a single +4 on a single stat.  With rolling like this you're basically playing easymode D&D."
dndnext,3e1lzu,Kangodo,3,Tue Jul 21 10:16:22 2015 UTC,"easymode? That raises so many questions. What is wrong with easy mode? What exactly is made easier? How is it that, in a game where the DM has nigh complete control over the environment, the game is somehow rendered ""easy"" but slightly above average ability scores?  Having higher initial ability scores does have a few important effects. You are less hindered by ability score requirements for heavy armor, feats, and multiclassing. You start out closer to max scores, so the players will generally take feats over ASIs more often/sooner. The players have more access to resources limited by abilities, like prepared spells and bardic inspiration.  But none of that quite makes the game easier, since the DM is presumably crafting the adventure to the party."

I use point buy anyway.  Abilities and Hit Points, both are fixed, not random.  Rolling for attributes is from the old days when your attributes had much less impact on your character."
dndnext,3e1lzu,ChaosDent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"As several have pointed out, with the flatter math of 5e the typical rolling method (4d6, drop the lowest) is really risky in regards to giving you a character that is is seriously overpowered (making things stupidly boring for you, likely and incredibly frustrating for your DM).  I do wonder what the actual math of it is in comparison, I think I read somewhere that the average ""4d6 drop lowest"" roll is roughly 16, 14, 13, 12, 10, 9 which I guess is a 30 (?) going by the point-buy system and that extra +1 here and/or there is definitely going to have more of an impact in 5e.  Meanwhile, 3d6 can be way too harsh, normally giving you something a handful of points below point buy and standard array.  Sometimes I wondered what if you chose race and class FIRST, then took ""4d6 drop lowest"" and were required to assign the scores as you receive them. You could wind up with a very strong but very dumb Wizard. It would suck power-wise, but it'd certainly be more interesting than the overpowered mega-hero you'd normally get by the standard rolling rules."
dndnext,3e1lzu,Unwyrden,4,Tue Jul 21 13:40:21 2015 UTC,"As you see from the graph /u/Unwyrden posted, 3d6 has a flatter bell curve centered on 10/11 and 4d6d1 has a steeper bell curve centered on 13 with a strong bias against low numbers. 3d6 is simply not acceptable for the linear modifiers used by post d20 system D&D, you would have to go back to the charted bonuses and penalties on that bell curve AD&D had.  I think you are right about the average 4d6d1 set, you should roll above the 27 point buy mark about 60% of the time. It is much less unfair to players and DMs in 5e than it was in 3e and 4e though. The ability score maximum prevents that accuracy difference between players from persisting forever."
dndnext,3e1lzu,thisbotsays,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:40 2015 UTC,"This. The odds are that rolling characters will be slightly ahead of a point buy characters, but not significantly, and not for long. If anything, it's a punishment to the player to not have any potential for growth and it gets boring being maxed out in an ability too early. Personally, I would make it so I had a big tertiary ability that fit my concept or make it so my top 3 ability scores were high but not maxed. It's just more fun that way.  My issue with the point buy system isn't the lack of a maxed stat, but that 15 seems low for a max starting ability...16 would make more sense to me."

There are rules in the PHB, but a lot people houserule the dice rolling rule, which is actually the deafult rule strangely, to suit the group's needs and wants. Wizard's sanctioned Adventurer's League uses the point buy system for balance and fairness reasons, so if those are your goals, go with that. But if you want a bigger modifier than +3 at level 1, then roll.  And if you want to have good stats in all of tour abilities reroll bad rolls.  Personally, I go point buy because the game is balances around that. A level 1 caster is going to have a spell dc of 13 at the early levels. A fighter is fgoing to have a +5 to attack. It also assumes average hit points per level after the first. It will work fine otherwise, but that is what it is balanced around because that is the average, expected value. It's math."

The variance in accuracy you get for rolling scores is pretty minor relative to most low level targets. It's when you get to level 4-8 and some players can take some huge force multiplying feats without really giving up that accuracy bump (since it was built in to the roll) that it gets messy.   Without feats or multiclassing someone might start out at a 20 while another player has a 15 or 16, but that variance will disappear by the time everyone is level 8."

I want something done (open the gates to an invading army, seduce the king's son, carry this object across a warded gateway) and in return you will receive my boon.  The character may not know why the patron wanted the job done, keep it in your pocket as a future plot hook.  I will trade you my boon for (your soul, your firstborn, the life of <personyoukilled>).  The deal is sealed by blood.  Another interesting case someone mentioned last week was the idea of a minor entity using the pact as a way of gaining a foothold to the material plane.  This works especially well for chanlocks - the familiar eventually turns out to have been the patron all along.  In all cases the patron should occasionally arrange some sort of temptation for the character but the nature of the pact allows no escape clause.  The boon, once granted, is permanent.  Unlike a cleric there is no provision for losing your powers if you act in opposition to your patron, but do not be surprised when others are raised up to punish your disloyalty."
dndnext,3dyvz1,zmaya,5,Mon Jul 20 20:18:30 2015 UTC,"Have you ever played Dishonored? It's a pretty good example of a Rogue striking a deal with a fey/old one (who has their own mysterious goals) and getting new powers.  Also keep in mind that the ""deal"" isn't always as important as the ""contract"". Which is to say, some power may come by accident (no deal per say), but still at a price.  Here is a repost of a comment I made in a topic about good warlocks:  ""I've got two Warlocks in my game. Both are good aligned.  The first was a thief and criminal until he stole a magic ring from a wizard. Turns out the ring had a demon bound to it and it branded itself to him once he put it on. He's since had a change of heart, and uses the powers to do what good he can to make up for his greedy past.  The other is a monk (one level) who was part of an order dedicated to protecting an ancient evil trapped within an enchanted mirror. A shogun (this is in Shou), seeking to take the mirror's power, razed the monestary to the ground and wiped out the order. The character was the only one to survive, and tried to destroy the mirror to keep it out of his hands. The magic had to go somewhere though, and the character ended up becoming the new prison. She now wanders the west, the last remnant of her order. She can draw on the ancient evil's power to protect herself, and has trained her whole life to harness/defend it. The process ravaged her soul however, and she can no longer harness her own Ki. (She can never gain another level of monk). She has great power, but it has come at a great cost.  Both are good characters. Both are bound to evil. It can be done, you just have to flesh it out."""
dndnext,3dyvz1,Jasonco2,6,Mon Jul 20 18:40:12 2015 UTC,"The standard Patron/Warlock pact will likely leave a player with never communicating with the Patron again.  The patron gives them the power for a reason. That reason is beyond that player or characters comprehension, and it is final. This is good for both building characters without having to worry about a campaign where the goal is to destroy your patron. Now you don't need to worry about all the logistical and 3.5 ""ahaha your paladin falls!"" moments from DMs.  The way I see it, Patrons are CR25+ creatures that see a need for getting the wrong guy in the right place, and understanding why isn't going to be as clear as ""I need you to do a thing""."
dndnext,3dyvz1,Hasire,5,Mon Jul 20 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"The standard Patron/Warlock pact will likely leave a player with never communicating with the Patron again.   That sounds like a really boring way to rule it.   Even if your patron is a manipulative chess-master that hides behind the scenes and only gave you power because you'll do what they want, anyway, it's still boring to never have them come up and makes the warlock thematically identical to a slightly-edgier wizard.   Consider how Athena shows up in The Odyssey. She never really makes a big deal or forces anything to happen, but she asserts both her patronage and authority over Odysseus and forcefully nudges him in the right direction, that is beneficial to her interests. Patrons should be similar, if a bit more dickish.   Unless you're a GOO-pact warlock; If your patron ever shows up and you've got THAT pact, no amount of running will save anyone."

dndnext,3dyvz1,Hasire,3,Mon Jul 20 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"Cautious, sure, but don't write off a legitimately fun roleplaying opportunity because you don't want one person to have too much spotlight.  Hell, all you have to do to include the other players is have one of the party members come back from an ill-timed bathroom break and stumble upon the warlock talking with Satan, the Devil. If you choose your stumbling party member well (i.e. neither the Rogue nor the Paladin), you could lump the whole party into an in-character argument/discussion of magical inter-planar ethics.   Shit like that is always fun, and usually leads to stronger in-character ties because people will tend to remember that time they all collectively decided to not murder the warlock over the whole Satan-is-my-master thing as a positive experience - albeit, one that means they should keep a closer eye on the warlock, but that's generally wise anyway."
dndnext,3dyvz1,the_singular_anyone,3,Mon Jul 20 20:03:54 2015 UTC,"Shit like that is always fun   I actively avoid situations where my players need to device to ""put up with something or John has to reroll"".  If there is a Paladin at your table, how can you ever expect them to  just be okay with the embodiment of everything he fights standing next to him. It absolutely is a risk that should be taken very carefully."
dndnext,3dyvz1,Hasire,3,Mon Jul 20 20:10:32 2015 UTC,"how can you ever expect them to just be okay with the embodiment of everything he fights standing next to him   If the warlock makes a good case, and if he's trying to use his Satan-powers to make the world a better place. Typical good warlock stuff.   Here's how I've seen this type of scenario typically play out:   The warlock, having his secret outed, feels super vulnerable. The warlock is also acutely aware that the party outnumbers him, and he can either run off into the wilds (which, meta, he doesn't want to do because then his game is effectively over) or he can attempt to persuade the party. Warlocks having a high charisma score, this seems like a pretty viable option and so the warlock is very likely to take it. The only other option on the table is ""I work for Satan, love it, and you have to accept that,"" which is readily obvious as stupid/suicidal to most players, and most infernal minions worth their salt know to lie about these things, anyhow.  If the warlock thinks he can persuade the one person who has seen him that his intentions are good, and to keep the secret, he will. This is the simplest solution for him, and generally the safest.  But as a DM I want to rope the whole party in, so I need to choose a character who will openly discuss this with the party, but that will not advocate straight-up killing the warlock. Druids are usually pretty good for this, as are fighters, rangers, and other classes that lend themselves well to pragmatism. If no aggressively-neutral characters are available, I always choose the chaotic, rogue-type characters, as they're almost universally much more inclined to keep the warlock's secret if they think it benefits them or the party.  Never choose barbarians. Barbarians cannot handle their shit.  If you manage to choose the perfect party member to lead the round-table discussion of whether or not to lynch the warlock, you as a DM have essentially already won. Players (unless they are supreme assholes, in which case you'd know that and not pull this maneuver) tend to shy away from infighting without a very good reason. This won't stop your paladins from trying to smite the warlock on the spot, but it will cause your neutral characters to intercede on the warlock's behalf, at least long enough for the warlock to speak his piece.  If other characters have demonstrated they will intercede on the warlock's behalf (at least to stop outright murder from happening), the paladin is less likely to outright murder the warlock without evidence that it was objectively necessary. Expect the paladin to keep a close eye on the warlock and have a hair-trigger for dealing with his bullshit.   Hardly any meta-ing involved. It's all about manipulating the players to play off each other. Y'know, DM stuff.  Oh, and have a contingency plan, like my standard:    If shit goes south, all the goblins in the world, drawn by the sound of a loud argument, spring an ambush."
dndnext,3dyvz1,the_singular_anyone,2,Mon Jul 20 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it depends on the background and flavor of the character. It could be a deal with satan for the ability to save your hometown and be balanced with a pact that says ""when I need you to destroy something, do it, no questions asked"". It could be a researcher running out of funding who needs a little extra-dimensional help and turns to an arch fae who will share the knowledge and so much more as long as the new warlock brings a newborn to the feywilds every so often so the arch fae can play house. It could be an average joe who some extra planar being needs because a mortal can do things that the being can't do, like subtly change the wording of a spell in a fancy book in a sealed library.  TLDR the pacts are really vague so you can pick a backstory point where the PC is in a bad situation and makes a deal that they find acceptable at the time, knowing that it is an ongoing business type relationship. A good DM should be able to use the patron as a hook when necessary, but not in a 'do this or die' type way."
dndnext,3dyvz1,galaxygengar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:15 2015 UTC,"In my Warlock's case, it was a granting of power and physical health in exchange for service.  The character was a frail cripple before the pact.  The patron being a Great Old One, the agreement was not exactly laid out in a straightforward manner. It occured during nightmares induced by contact with an artifact, and I was only dimly aware of what I was getting into.  Since then, the relationship has been almost comical, with my patron being terrible at communicating clearly to this ant-like creature and me tending to obstinately go my own way.  I have had some direct communication with it, but it tends to be cryptic and speak in one or two words at a time.  That's not to say I have free rein, however.  I have learned it likes it when I kill abberations, and it particularly hates aboleths.  It seems to get frustrated if I don't fulfill this duty.  At one point it arranged for a party member to get captured and enslaved by an aboleth just to motivate me and the party to go kill it."

You can't think to yourself, ""Okay, once I hit, I need to GTFO so these guys can put some distance between them and me and then I'll calm down.""  You can only think ""RRAARRGHHHH BLOOD BLOOD KILLKILLKILL!!!""  The text block for the Berserker Axe does say if you have multiple attacks in one attack action, ""you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target.""  I would rule that applies to all movement.  Otherwise it's less a Berserker Axe and more a Whoops I Slipped Axe.  That's my interpretation, anyway.   That said, the imp idea is pretty clever, I hadn't thought of that.  Charming, Grapple, Hold Person, Command, none of these spells would break the berserking, just slow him down until he breaks free and attacks on his next turn.  I would lock him down with your tank, and when everyone else is clear, the tank moves and Dashes to get far enough away.   You could try blinding the berserker and cast Silence or something, since he must see or hear a creature to remain berserked.

dndnext,3dzw74,Spinozistico,9,Mon Jul 20 21:48:47 2015 UTC,"Try to avoid forcing the players to do a certain thing, especially during a roleplay interaction like this.  Use the persuasion check to tell the player what their character believes.  Make sure your roleplay and explanation of the persuasion contest outcome provides supporting reasons why they believe this.  Make sure you put it in the context of each character.  Maybe the barbarian thinks the guard reminds him of an old drinking buddy he liked in his youth.  The bard might think the guards smell like chocolate chip cookies and that convinces her.  Maybe the gnome is convinced that one of the guards is the magical wizard he is looking for in disguise.  Magic works in mysterious ways."
dndnext,3dzw74,pinkd20,3,Mon Jul 20 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"This is great advice, ignore most of mine as long as your players are even half decent at role playing and not making ""meta"" decisions"
dndnext,3dzw74,techiesgoboom,3,Mon Jul 20 22:53:42 2015 UTC,"In general many DMs don't allow charisma checks to be made against PC.  In practice this means situations like this can't really happen.  What I would do is to take each PC's insight and turn it into a passive score (similar to perception).  Whenever it comes time for you to make the charisma check fromm the NPCs I would do so behind the screen and compare it to the PC's passive insight.  If the NPCs succeed I would write on a little slip of paper ""you are magically charmed by the NPC and will follow his reasonable suggestion"" or something along those lines.  One thing to keep in mind is that the spell friends has somatic and a pretty specific material component (a bit of makeup applied to one's face while casting).  So if the NPCs are at all visible to the PCs as they cast it it will be pretty obvious they cast a spell, and if the PCs have seen friends cast before they would know what actual spell was cast."
dndnext,3dzw74,techiesgoboom,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:56 2015 UTC,"PC's can be charmed, but Friends is a poor way to do so as it makes the Charmed person Hostile after it ends. Charming magic wouldn't even make the person put on the manacles, since a Charmed person simply regards the charmer as a friendly acquaintance, and is not obligated to obey in any way.  Suggestion might work, but as others have said I'd try to keep the ""forcing players to do things against their will"" to an extreme minimum. I wouldn't allow a Persuasion or Imtimidate check to force a PC to do something (especially since those checks don't even force NPC's to do something; imtimidating someone could just as easily cause them to run away or attack as hand over their gold or w/e). Players generally tend to dislike effects that forces them and their characters to behave in ways they do not want."

I didn't expect any of these methods to work, but I wanted to employ them for feel of the situation. I want the PC to get an idea of what they're dealing with here.   I'll probably describe the persuasion attempts (even with Friends casted) much like pinkd20 described, as in tailored to the PC, but I don't expect them to work. Even if the Suggestion spell goes off, I'm going to point out to the PC that they're a hero (read, they actually have a mind of their own) and they can interpret the command however they please.   I fully suspect this will devolve into a combat, but I wanted to get the flavor of this type of guard attempting to arrest them for story reasons.

Furthermore, ""a fang of Yeenoghu can lead to a startling increase in gnoll population"" and ""Finding and killing the fang is the only way to keep the population in check"" seem to indicate that having one around makes the population grow at an unusual rate, not that it is the only way in which gnolls reproduce."

Having to give birth through a long tube like that often causes tearing, which leads to the mother bleeding to death. This is a good reason for Gnolls to seek alternative reproductive methods."

Mostly without spoilers:  If the party ends up at Beliard its probably because they're trying to track the caravan and that's the last place it was seen.  Chapter 3 shows the path and fate of the caravan, so let the party talk to some nameless npcs who mention the direction it went and how it was entirely boring or whatnot.  The party can follow the path the caravan took and find signs of the ambush and it's fate.  They could follow the tracks of the attackers and see where they went, which is indicated in the start of chapter 3.  It would lead you to one of the keeps, just not the first one in the chapter."
dndnext,3dzplc,purefire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:21 2015 UTC,"There is an ex-caravan guard in Red Larch that mentions brawling with some of the delegation's guards in Beliard.   The Delegation passed through and was ambushed to the south of Beliard, but they really don't give much info on the town. I don't think you are missing anything.  Since there are exactly 2 places to cross the Dessarin river in this valley, it is probable that your PCs will reach Beliard at some point (even if they follow different clues to find the delegation). Also, reaching Beliard requires crossing the awesome Stone Bridge, a sweet place for some combat. (I think one of the 'reprisals' has some Giant Vulture-mounted air cultists you can use here).   You should note that the Fallen Knights' body the delegation is escorting to Summit Hall is not mentioned anywhere else in the book, so you could have the PCs find it at the site of the Ambush. (I think it is mentioned under the Order of the Gauntlet 'hooks' in CH3).   Also, the Knights of Samular can be called upon to 'secure' the Haunted Keeps once the PCs have cleared them out. Doing so requires crossing the river to the Summit Hall, possibly passing through Beliard.  So even though the book does not give you much about the little town, you might want to 'generate' some NPCs that live there. An innkeeper, Shopkeeper, ect... Also think about what they could be selling here."

Fill it with some treasure, maybe plan 3 or 4 encounters (can be monsters or puzzles), that sort of thing. You can even block off part of the ruin with cave ins, so they'll try to stick to the proper area.   You'll have to consider quite a few things about this place before you set your players in there. What purpose did it serve when it was built? Maybe it's an old wizard's tower, maybe a temple, a keep, maybe even a warehouse. What civilization used to live there? What civilization or ecosystem is inhabiting it now? Why are they inhabiting it?  These questions don't have to have super complicated answers, depending on who lived/is living in the ruin, but it's a good reference to have when role playing. Also, those two questions will determine what kind of goodies players can find. If it's an old wizard's tower, expect lots of unusual tomes on the wizard's preferred school of magic, maybe some old scrolls, maybe a couple of interesting uncommon magic items. If it's an old warehouse, you'd have lots of old crates filled with things that warehouse used to store, maybe a room for counting money and goods. If you are going to inhabit the ruin with monsters, there may be skeletons of meals long past, monster waste (AKA poop), maybe a nest. However, if it's been taken over by kenku, expect rooms to store weapons, barracks for them to sleep in, places to store any sort of shinies they've pilfered off of wanderers, etc.  Hope this jumpstarts some ideas for you.

Just string some rooms together on graph paper, and flesh out the purpose of the room.

If you make it too big it will take multiple sessions to finish which can break the immersion of exploring a ruin.)  End it by giving them some reward that is both useful and explores some of the lore behind the crypt. Maybe a crown with some magical effect, that used to belong to some ancient desert King. Maybe there's someone out there looking for the crown, and if the adventurers go showing it off, who knows. Maybe that someone might be coming after them.

Archieunuchs—each in charge of a group of eunuchs—were among the principal officers in Constantinople, under the emperors. Under Justinian in the 6th century, the eunuch Narses functioned as a successful general in a number of campaigns. By the last centuries of the Empire the number of roles reserved for eunuchs had reduced, and their use may have been all but over.

dndnext,3dztxv,Dr_Oatker,2,Mon Jul 20 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"Back in college, everyone had laptops and we often used them for mood music. It actually helped as we played in classrooms (not while class was going on) and they were big echo chambers. The music helped mellow out the voices. Plus, we were all sitting across from one another on a big desk, so there was no issue hearing each other.  Now... well, we play in a living room, scatted in several different chairs. It can be hard to hear at a distance so the mood music has to be either low enough that some PCs don't hear it, or else loud enough we have to raise our voices to be heard.  So my suggestion:   Know your environment. How loud does the music have to be to be heard and is that too much that it interrupts the PC/GM communication. Choose music that is either effectively white noise (a lot of classical or instrumental music is good for this. Lyrics tend to draw attention). As just background noise, you can let it play and move on.  If you plan on having the music fit the scene, you will be 50% DJ, 50% GM. The more you plan the music choices to the scenes, the more you will need to micromanage it. Have the players stopped to check rules or plan? You better have the ""Fight Scene"" track on hold. Do you have a cool cutscene with sweeping orchestral sound? Hope the PCs don't interrupt (swelling music ""Fools I am dark lord Negvar and I will..."" ""I shoot him while he blabs. Roll for surprise."" ""Steve, I'm trying to set a scene here. Stop."" ""Yeah? Well, I'm trying to get sneak attack. Looks like Dark Lord 'shotwitharrows' is totally flat footed right now."" ""Damnit, Steve."") And so forth. You will need several play lists, and will probably need to restart the songs, shift play lists, and even scroll through them to get the ""right"" song for the moment. This slows down the RP action as the players wait for you to break out Anvil of Crom or Yakkity Sax (for my group, both apply) Use CDs or MP3s. Do not use Youtube. DO NOT. Nothing ruins a game faster than everyone stopping and staring as a google powered You Tube Ad blasts out a commercial for something you DON'T want people to know about. Or worse, lately YouTube has been shoving 5min or longer ads onto songs. Nothing is worse than trying to listen to a 3 minute song and seeing a 23 minute ""commercial"" for some rap song/movie hitting the play list. Sure, you can click past, but again, slows down game play."

Games included are Skyrim and Oblivion, Dragon age, baldurs gate/icewind dale, neverwinter nights, dragons dogma, etc. I recommend avoiding iconic stuff like most of the Assassin's creed music, which would be less ""mood music"" and more ""that one song from venice in AC2"". Skyrim and oblivion occasionally do this too, but most of the ambiance music from those are just too perfect to pass up.

For example RAW could be interpreted in such a way that the wolf wouldnt have been intelligent enough to pull the ranger out without a direct command from the ranger, who couldnt do so due to unconciousness. That being said, I love the ranger companion archetype and would like to play a ranger some time."
dndnext,3dw0kv,WizzardofAus,21,Mon Jul 20 00:26:23 2015 UTC,"that's a good point re: how the DM rules. Personally have to say though I would find that a pretty dickish reading of it. You'll see even untrained dogs pull their owners from danger, and most trained rescue and safety animals can (and will often) be taught as much. Within the rules the book explains that if the Ranger goes down the Beast Companion will protect them so I feel like that's a pretty easy way to see protection.  Edit: I couldn't find that rules, I must have read it elsewhere? maybe a Crawford or Mearls explanation? (I see now it is in the Errata that WoTC released) Either way, I stand by the concept that the wording of the rules is to maintain action economy in a battle while the Ranger is standing, not to restrict the Beast to complete inaction once the Ranger goes down."
dndnext,3dw0kv,WizzardofAus,5,Mon Jul 20 00:31:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah but given that logic, you also see untrained dogs jump to their owners defense when they are in danger but a Ranger still must forgo one of their own attacks to command the beast companion (an animal who is obviously deeply bonded with their Ranger) to attack so it just comes back to how the DM is willing to accomodate."
dndnext,3dw0kv,Plutoid,20,Mon Jul 20 01:37:28 2015 UTC,"If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself.   This is verbatim from the errata.

The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere’s area is difficult terrain. When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.""   That could be a confusing situation.  I think what it comes down to is not whether or not the wolf will try to protect the Ranger, but whether or not it's smart enough to know where and what the danger is, where is safe, and how to get the ranger from danger to safety.  I guess if there's any question you can always have the wolf roll an INT check."

Trying to put people to sooth a crowd of people with a harp? Sounds perfect. Trying to sooth the crowd with the largest drum in the world? That might be a higher DC. Similarly, a Druid in Cat form should have a climbing speed of 30 feet. They shouldn't be able to use this to climb a mountainside at a speed of 30 feet."

Unless this is like a completely sheer cliff face, tons of animals are capable of climbing mountains at extremely impressive speeds.  Case in point.

dndnext,3dw0kv,KatherineDuskfire,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"First, wolves are not dogs (although we might excuse this detail as the wolf is a companion animal of a fantasy character.)  Second, as story:  Years back I, along with a few other people, were trying to put out a small but quickly growing grass fire in a field one time.  (Some knuckleheads were shooting bottle rockets out over a tinder dry field in rural WI)  Somebody's pit mix was running around at the time.  As I was fighting the fire he bit me on the calf.  Confused, I yanked away, swatted at the dog, and went back to trying to put out the fire with a blanket.  It didn't occur to me until later that he was trying to drag me out of the fire.  I figured he was just confused in the chaos that was going on and nipped me.  The thing is, I'm sure his heart was in the right place BUT I'm not convinced that the dog quite knew what he was doing.  Maybe he could've, maybe not.    The thing is, with this game mechanic, there are levels of complexity and chaos that a dumb dog couldn't figure out that might be a snap for a smarter one.  I mean, PCs have stat blocks.  So do animals.  Why give the wolf a chance - though not a certainty - that he can figure out what to do?  The DM could make the DC as difficult or as challenging as he/she sees fit.  Maybe if the animal would know what to do it should be a STR check.  I do it myself with my 7 INT cleric all the time. If I come up with a solution to a problem that I think probably ought to require more INT than my character possesses I roll a D20 and on < 10 I keep my mouth shut.  :)"

dndnext,3dw0kv,KatherineDuskfire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:46:41 2015 UTC,Best way to do it was to make it a bonus action.  Duel wielding is that way...spiritual weapon is that way...as a bonus action you can direct the pet to do what ever.  Also if the ranger cast a spell then they can't direct pet since most of the time ranger spells are bonus action spells.
dndnext,3dw0kv,WizzardofAus,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't really compare it to spiritual weapon though. Spiritual weapon requires a 2nd level spell slot to use and only works for a limited time. It might be balanced if you required both the Ranger and the Beast to be attacking the same target and within 10(?) feet of each other.
dndnext,3dw0kv,Toast_Machine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:41:17 2015 UTC,Thats a good balance there. Although screws over bow rangers. But yeah definitely works well.

I like the idea of adjusting the range with the Ranger level. At level 1, you have to be within 5 feet of each other. At level 20, you probably don't have much of a range restriction other then being within sight. This system would allow for bow rangers to work with their beasts but they would delay a bit."

dndnext,3dw0kv,Toast_Machine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:05 2015 UTC,or why not Bonus Action at levels 3 & 4 and then part of the Attack action (as stated in RAW) at Level 5? A little convoluted but keeps the whole action econ in place.

Yeah i guess it opens up your bonus action part...but then you're losing half a real action.   In 3.x it just had its own initiative which might best. But to balance  it can only move or attack. If the player says to do something specific, it will be able to perform that full action then no matter what (as long as it has movement speed and can reach the location). But it requires the player to use its action to do so."
dndnext,3dw0kv,Toast_Machine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"you're not losing half a real action, though.

Utility-wise most of them make great scouts and can be useful out of combat most of the time.  In combat one of the major issues I had while playing a beast master was how the beast became glass canon-y as you leveled up and start to encounter higher level/capable enemies. The beast companion's HP scales poorly and once enemies hit harder/easier the beast is more likely to go down.
dndnext,3dw0kv,Lord_of_Hydras,3,Mon Jul 20 03:23:33 2015 UTC,this is actually a really good point that I have a lot of trouble with and is a good argument against the class.

dndnext,3dw0kv,Sir_Cuitry,3,Mon Jul 20 08:15:41 2015 UTC,"The animal companion is essentially as having a d6 hit dice, except they don't get their con mod to their hit points, probably to preserve balance and not make high Con beast too powerful. That is squishy, but then you realize that the ranger gets a d10 hit die, making it technically one of the tankiest classes.  Which comes back to the main problem with the animal companion in 5e. Giving an extra body with HP and actions is really hard to balance."
dndnext,3dw0kv,Lord_of_Hydras,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:26:12 2015 UTC,"also consider that later on the Ranger can share spells with the beast, making it either more of a power-house/controller and/or extending its life via HP replenish of some sort."
dndnext,3dw0kv,lordzygos,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"I remember someone who detailed why the beastmaster is unloved in 5e.He said it was  designed like a 3.5 class,where you get all your special class bonuses at lvl 1 and work through largely empty levels to get anything good.The other classes of 5e gradually progress in power and abilities,so there are no empty level ups."
dndnext,3dw0kv,Lord_of_Hydras,3,Mon Jul 20 05:01:31 2015 UTC,"This is clearly not the case, as every class is designed to get something cool at every level, either new spell levels or abilities. I think the post you are referencing means here you get access to the companion early, but it is is limited earlier for balance reasons. This is true, and it makes people feel awkward, but is not really different than learning new spells or how to attack more."
dndnext,3dw0kv,aldurljon,2,Mon Jul 20 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, however I still rank beastmaster lowly on the class list.In all honesty I like the Warlocks Chain Pact much more.The pseudodragon can apply the Poisoned condition for an hour,and if they really botch their save theyre unconcious.The imps poison is the most potent at 3d6,but I prefer the pseudodragon."

dndnext,3dw0kv,Treberto,2,Mon Jul 20 15:05:42 2015 UTC,"I mean more that, the beastmaster focuses on improving a single feat of theirs rather than adding in more feats to make them a better beastmaster."

I'm getting some help over on WotC forums and some of them recommend giving the subrace +1 wis, and   Mental Fortress:  (Borrowed from Gnome): You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.  Then give them access to the Duergar Magic feat, that lets them cast nondetection at will, Darkness, Invisibility, and Enlarge 1/day.  This seems ok, but then I look at Drow and Tiefling who get their racial magic for free and don't have to spend a feat on it?"
dndnext,3dy6df,hungryghoast,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:41 2015 UTC,"Well the Drow at least has the excuse of the Sunlight Sensitivity setback that offesets some of the other bonuses it gets.  Nondetection as an at-will spell is quite strong (even if you limit it to casting it on himself, which I assume you would?) and I think more than compensates as a feat next to the once-a-day casts that Drow and Tieflings get."

The current Adventurers League season is season 2, Elemental Evil. Season 1 was Tyranny of Dragons.   AL is organized played and follows certain rules and guidelines.

dndnext,3dz9zw,ademonicspoon,4,Mon Jul 20 19:16:19 2015 UTC,"RAW, you do not add the proficiency to the DC. It's tricky, though, because similar moves like the Battle Master's ""Save-DC"" are based off the calculation: 8 + STATmodifier + Proficiency.   Specifically with the weak CR1/8 creature you're mentioning, adding Proficiency to the DC would help to make the beast more useful. Otherwise, it's rather unimpressive.   However, a high level Wolf companion with +6 Proficiency would be forcing opponents to make a DC17 STR save twice per round. A single failure, and the target is knocked prone... In my opinion, this would be unreasonably powerful.   EDIT: If you're interested in the poisonous snake as an animal companion, you might consider the ""Giant Poisonous Snake"" as an alternative. It's a medium sized creature (CR1/4) that does better damage and has more potent poison. It also has 10' reach on its strikes, which is pretty badass."

The Beastmaster write up explains:   Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in.   Oddly, none of the Beasts seem to have saving throws that they're proficient in? So as a compensation I've let the Beastmaster in the group I DM for add proficiency to that save DC it forces. It also only seems to make sense if the Beast is supposed to scale effectively and if using the Beast in combat is still going to be a real bonus as you level (otherwise you might be better just taking your own attack, I reckon)."
dndnext,3dz9zw,ademonicspoon,5,Mon Jul 20 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"that's just future proofing. That line you quoted unequivocally states what they add the proficiency bonus to, and it does not include save DCs for effects."

What if you start every stat at 10, you have a pool of 5-7 d6, and you roll them one at a time and add them to a stat, so you could put more than one die roll into a stat or none at all. I would also put a cap on how high you could go, say 16 or 18 depending on the DM. And for those who like the chance to roll play low stats you could start at 8 for each stat before rolling and adding."

This pretty much guarantees viable characters while allowing for the occasional oddball talent (like a really bookish paladin or strong wizard.)

dndnext,3dz81d,deathbymanga,3,Mon Jul 20 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"You want to use more dice to create an average clump for the scores. 27 Point buy spread across 6 Stats averages 12.5 in each stat. Next we would need to find a set of dice that clumps at 12.5 with very rare deviations. The rolls also need to be within the min-max range of the point buy, namely 8-15.  Using AnyDice we can see that 3d4+4 matches most of the criteria. Using the roller feature we can see that the numbers are VERY average and unfortunately almost never actually reach the full 27 Point Buy.  So a straight dice roll plus modifier won't work out of the box. Instead we might try making the modifier dependent on the previous roll. So 3d4+4 nets a 12, no change, a 13 however makes it 3d4+3, a 15 would be 3d4+1 and an 8 would be 3d4+7. Lets do a test set of rolls:   12(3d4+4) 4 Points 14(3d4+4) 7 Points 11(3d4+2) 3 Points 15(3d4+5) 9 Points 08(3d4+1) 0 Points 12(3d4+7) 4 Points   Total 27 Points  I'm going to try one more time. Some were above or below the max 8-15 and I just trimmed them to match:   12 [4] 12 [4] 12 [4] 14 [7] 10 [2] 14 [7]   Total 28 Points  The modifier variations are off, but the idea seems to work out.

My party's hunter has Archery and 20 DEX at level 3 for a +9 to attack. In our last encounter he still was missing the majority of his attack rolls because he was rolling so poorly. We were only fighting Verterans (17 AC) and Animated Armors (18 AC). Mind you, that was a tough fight for everyone and it was a ""Deadly"" encounter.

There's a reason there's a 15 and a 14 in the stat array, and most races get a +2 and a +1. so that they can get a 16 in two of their stats. thus being an expert in them. and better than even the average adventurer who doesn't benefit from being such a superior race in that field.   and i've actually felt the repercussions of having a 0 or -1 in a skill I want to roll. my rogue has a bad habit of failing her intelligence checks and strength saving throws because of this.   personally, I don't want my players to be crippled with a -3 modifier just so they can have a +4/+5 at the start of the game. if they really want to have such awesome modifiers, then wait until later on in the game."

That's fine, but treating it as the default when it's a variant rule is odd. If WotC thought the rolling method was broken, then I don't think it would be a possibility let alone the primary method.  Is a first level PC with a score of 20 in their main stat excessive? ...likely, but taking that option from them is dangerously close to DM metagaming. Remember that that PC has no possible growth.

Not sure why you think adventurers are not supposed to be any different from a commoner, since Commoners don't even have Classes. Even city guards don't have Fighter levels. The simple fact that you ARE an actual class makes you vastly superior to the normal person you run into.  A Panther is a killing machine that easily slaughters civilians and townfolk. It has 12 AC and 13 HP, deals 5 (1d6+2) with a bite or  4 (1d4+2) damage with it's claws which means with each attack it kills a Commoner flat out as long as it hits (which is easy with +4 to hit on a 10 AC). This creature is an easy potential one-shot, two shot at most for an Adventurer of 1st level. Normal humans could not even fight this thing, let alone butcher it with ease.  Commoners have 10 AC, and a whopping 4 HP. They deal 2 (1d4) damage on a swing, with no modifier at all.

Everyone theoretically volunteered to be a mercenary monster hunter, so they should have quite a bit in common.  My general rule for DMing custom games is to react to what the players are interested in and not over plan. Giving the players some influence into the culture and politics of their homeland helps them get and stay invested. Don't let them just dictate it, but work with them to shape their vision into something you are comfortable with.  Also, some straightforward monster hunts or dungeon romps will probably be fun initially, but I would gradually open up their agency within The Company as the PCs grow more powerful. Let them ascend through the ranks and eventually have them start assigning new recruits to missions (and deal with the horrible attrition rate that probably entails!).  Some other stuff I like:   The Company's home base is built on top of a classic Blackmoor/Greyhawk style dungeon with some mythic treasure at the bottom luring the leaders into delving, thus causing attrition on the high end of the leadership. They have to deal with occasional raids from the inhabitants, and they often send parties down to clear out whatever has reclaimed the first few levels when this becomes a problem. The Company is occasionally given missions to enter other planes to kill or capture a creature for ""research"" or to preempt a potential threat. Political strife between The Company and one or more of the cities that requires teams operating there to do so with much greater secrecy. This strife can come into greater focus for the PCs as they ascend the ranks. Power struggles within the company that the PCs have to navigate, especially where there is no clearly correct moral stance."

dndnext,3dvo9k,DMJason,12,Mon Jul 20 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"edit t add, this only applies to an ancient red dragon, not Tiamat.  Not having her stat block I assumed she was similar, just with upgraded numbers.  I was horribly mistaken.  Should be super simple really (I don't have Tiamats full stat block so any super interesting abilities might change this.  Tiamat has 630 HP.  A commoner only hits on a crit, which would deal an average of 9 damage with a light crossbow.  That comes out to an even 70 crits to down the dragon which is a total of 1400 attacks.  On top of that only commoners that save on the fear could attack, which for a commoner is again a 20.  This would take a whopping 28000 commoners to kill tiamat in the first round of combat.  Now we don't need to worry about that number, because the goal isn't to kill in a single, simply to kill.  So the goal is to figure out how many commoners tiamat could kill until the fear wears off.   Now Tiamats breath (assuming a 90 foot cone) can take out 251 commoners (one in each 5ft square) in a single go.  The basic attacks are a simple 3 people killed a turn.  It would also get a single Wing Attack (Legendary) which could kill 28 if surrounding the dragon perfectly (although 1 1/2 would survive the save)  So lets assume Tiamat gets a breath 1/3 of the time (if similar to an ancient Red Dragon's breath)  This comes out to killing an average of 113 commoners a turn.  So, the fear lasts for a minute, after which everyone gets to act normally.  During that time Tiamat kills a simple 1243 (10 rounds +1 more because Tiamat has initiative) commoners.  Now the downside is is that those are feared are running, while any that make the save vs the fear will be staying close which means they are the first to die.  Let's assume that no damage is dealt to Tiamat until the fear wears off to make the numbers simple for now.  So if we throw 2643 commoners at Tiamat, he goes down on round number 11.  let's try throwing 1763 instead.  This gives us 520 after the fear.  First round we get 26 crits. next round we get another 20 (total 46) Next round is 15 (total 61) Next round is 9 (total 70) Killing Tiamat successfully with 1763 commoners.  Now if we wanted to complicate this, 88 of those commoners would save on fear the first round, dealing out 4 crits.  Another ~80 would save the next, dealing 4 crits of their own.  Now at this point I'm going to give up on the math, because some will die to breath, some won't.  Some that survive will move closer and so on.   The point is, worst case scenario it would take 1763 commoners to kill Tiamat.  If we figure that those saving on fear are spread out, so that while tiamat is breathing giant groups down as most are running people will be spread out as they run I'd safely figure that 1200 could do it.  I'd put even odds on about 800 if they were smart about it.  TL;DR 1763 commoners could definitely kill Tiamat.  Likely 1200 or even possibly 800."

Besides her three normal attacks (2 claws 15ft, 1 tail 25ft), she gets 5 legendary actions, 2 of which can be used to use one of the head's breath weapons (3 are a 90ft cone) or 1 for a bite.  Her breaths have no recharge, and are available every round.  She can also take a reaction every turn instead of every round.  So 2 claws, 1 tail, 1 bite, and 2 90ft cones every turn would be her normal attacks, plus she can react every turn.  She also regenerates 30 hit points at the start of her turn.

Your calculation is based on that all of those commoners can actually reach her with their attacks at the same time, which is far from possible. I also have no idea where you get your attacks from because that's not what they are at all. Her cones are 90 foot cones (or 120 feet lines), but they are legendary actions, and she has enough for 2 per round as well as one bite. Her own multiattack, is just frightful presence, 2 claw attacks and one tail attack. No wing attack at all. So no, she kills 506 commoners per round of combat. And if we are to keep the calculation simple as you say, that's 10 rounds before the commoners could do anything. That's 5566 commoners killed before they can even act. You better have enough stuns to hit with at least 4 stun attacks per round so as to expend her legendary actions on resisting that.  And then it's all moot anyway because she's immune to non magical weapons and commoners simply don't have stuff like that. Simply put, she does not care one bit how many you throw at her. If it's commoners, they are at absolute worst, simply standing in the way until they die in very very large numbers... Also, Tiamat has regeneration.  Interesting note with Tiamat though, is that she gets a reaction against each of those commoners, but, she has seemingly nothing to spend those reactions on. There's nothing in her profile that has a reaction as a cost."

Unless you are level 15 or a meaty class, you are probably going to get dropped.  Otherwise, you can always have heroes and heralds of gods that operate on a much larger scale.   In our campaign, we basically had to recruit the help of these level 20 (I assume, maybe even higher) heroes that we ran into to help defeat this epic-powerful entity (later found it it was a Ancient Black Dragon with a Lair, and some templates, like 7 additional levels of Sorcerer). If those guys were willing to help with something like that, a roving band of guys who just do what they want would likely earn the ire of kings and such who would hire such heroes.

Around level 5, your players are pretty strong as far as normal humans go. They start taking out the easy Draugr dungeons.   Tier 3 is level 11-14, and it's the dragon encounters. The normal ones.   Tier 4 is level 15-20, and is the Alduin fight (it if was not total shit in the game.). The entire tier is prepping to find those artifacts which can hurt the big bad."
dndnext,3dvo9k,KeinBaum,10,Mon Jul 20 16:13:43 2015 UTC,Honestly?  Never.  There is already someone more powerful out there fighting on the side of good and law.  Now while the rest of ca might eventually become powerful enough t kill the town guard this attract the attention of the king's personal guard.  If the can kill them then the King likely is able to access the aforementioned most powerful NPC adventurers.  Once the players can take them out they are now the most powerful things in existence and can get what they want. It's totally up to you as a damn to decide where to draw the line.  For reference Elminster is probably one of the last lines of defense in the forgotten realms.  In 3.0 he was cr40.

dndnext,3dvo9k,Kindulas,7,Mon Jul 20 01:21:57 2015 UTC,"Consider that they live in a world that has 15th level adventures. Are you saying that at some point cities and kingdoms just go ""Well, nothing we can do about it."" Of course not! If there is one thing that a king fears, it's people like that running amok within their kingdom.  There are always answers. Each garrison has a small stock of ""emergency"" anti-magic zone, a tiny stash of small stones that has a bit of spell resistance to protect the scroll users... just enough to deal with one ""situation"" and then having to ask for a restock from the capital. Or they have a way to contact the capital ""Hey, we got five adventurers, can any of you notify the mage college so they can teleport over here, timestop this and imprison them?""  Another way, as BadKarma said ""bigger fish"", if there is one thing that might make level 15 adventures stop, is knowing that there is a group of 6 or so, level 18 adventures who'd GLADLY take up a contract to stop them, heck they can risk pissing off an entire paladin order and a few religions. Do they WANT to be the group that can suddenly get NO help at all from ANYONE? because they went and got themselves excommunicated from the kingdoms faith.  Another thing is, which system? In 5th edition even regular guards can be dangerous to higher level players, if they are not high level, make sure they understand that behavior and actions have consequences this is the most important thing, be consistent, if they fuck up, let them fuck up and suffer the consequences."

dndnext,3dvo9k,SpiketailDrake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:25:49 2015 UTC,"Before we had left for the summer they finished a very long and deadly dungeon/city crawl through a goblin complex. Took like 3 sessions. Was crazy. Their mission was to end the goblin threat/raids on nearby settlements. They did this by striking a deal with the goblin ""Scar"" who lead a rebellion with our heroes' aid during the heroes' trial by combat/execution. This set up a friendly and mostly peaceful goblin society. As a reward from the goblin they received interesting weapons dropped by the previous war chiefs as well as gold and a nice looking amulet.  IF YOU REALIZE THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN STOP READING GUYS.  I have already planned out the next few sessions. They are gonna involve a shapes gifting mercenary gang hunting one of the heroes. A mercenary camp. A powerful Druid and her forest. And lastly a necromacers army. All their choices in the previous events will effect the last one. And if they make a mistake with the necromacer they may well release a creature that is 10 or more levels above them. This is where the amulet comes it. While completely plain in nature I'm going I have it refuse to be sold or given away through magic. If the party is massacred as they very well may be, the amulet will break and send them back in time to just before their error. It's basically a ""one free do over coin."" They just don't know it at all."
dndnext,3dvo9k,-Dusque-,3,Tue Jul 21 00:13:01 2015 UTC,"I'm going to agree with people and say never completely, though one could argue that level 17+ characters can... But really it's all about where. Level 11 adventurers can probably do whatever they want in a small town, but not a city. It's all about whether anyone is around who can stop them - which is your decision.  It's good to keep the tiers in mind, though, as described in pg 15 of the PHB.   At levels 1-4 they're beginners. They can push around old ladies and some street thugs, but the law is well above them.  At levels 5-10 they're normal adventurers. Adventurers are, by nature, hot shit, but these adventures aren't quote worthy of song and legend - they're your run-of-the-mill badasses. Quite possibly thoughest guys at the bar at the time, but not the toughest people who've ever been in it. They could probably deal with a normal dispatch of the town guard, but if the law really bears down on them they aren't that special.   At levels 11-16 they're getting into larger than life territory. Deserving of a reputation as famous heroes, the law might be hard pressed to deal with them at that point. So small and maybe even medium towns might not be able to corral them easily, but if the entire guard gets on their case they're still going to have a problem - it's not like they can fend off armies alone, not in 5e.  At level 17-20 they're fabled folk of legend, and these people could probably get away with just about anything outside of huge cities. But if they piss off a nation, they're still gonna have problems. The Wizard could take out an approaching army with Meteor Swarm... But a few high level assassins (s)he might not be prepared for."
dndnext,3dvo9k,Daedalus128,4,Sun Jul 19 23:33:51 2015 UTC,"What the level 17-20 players should fear is not armies or such. It's when the King/Emperor/whatever they've pissed off offers the keys to his treasury to whoever can defeat the players, thus suddenly bringing every adventurer group around the same level to the land. It's the fact that they're being bounty hunted by several groups, each with wizards who can scry and what not, rogues to sneak and stab and so forth."

dndnext,3dvo9k,Daedalus128,2,Mon Jul 20 01:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah the game is ""sane"" from 1-16 I think.

Though Ancient dragons are still supposed to be trouble for even such characters."
dndnext,3dvo9k,RTukka,3,Mon Jul 20 05:54:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on your setting, but in a generic D&D setting there's usually the assumption that the high lvl PCs aren't the only powerful beings in the world -- in fact, there are far more powerful things out there.  In a world where highly powerful individuals can fly, teleport, or slice through 9 soldiers in under six seconds, rulers and other important people would need to take certain precautions lest their lands and possessions are destroyed by these powerful people.  So let's say you're a king -- not physically powerful, not very gifted in magic, but you hold tons of influence and tons of wealth. You don't want an assassin to teleport into your throne room and end your life, right? So, what do you do? A couple options:   get protective magic items to protect yourself have protective wards cast and maintained around your home hire powerful beings to guard you! You've got money and influence, use that to hire some high level mercenaries clones, duplicates, illusory projections, so you're safe somewhere else   So it shouldn't be an issue to keep PCs in place, because the PCs aren't the only high levels around and folk in the world would have to protect themselves accordingly.  At the same time, don't overdo it. If level 15 PCs enter some isolated village, chances are they could massacre everyone there without much resistance. Though if word spreads on what the PCs did there should be some consequences.  But they pull that crap in a city with wealthy, powerful, and influential people that want to stay safe? People that would realistically have to deal with high-level maniacs before? They should expect GTA-style escalation of violence: a squad of low-level fighters, first. Those get taken out? Specialized units of melee and casters. Still need more? Summoned monsters, high-level mercenaries teleport in and bring the heat. What would a country do if, say, a group of highly trained terrorists started blowing crap up? Similar response."

dndnext,3dvo9k,redditname01,2,Sun Jul 19 23:32:57 2015 UTC,"What about the idea of an ultimate guard faction? High level guardsmen that are stationed in every major town. They don't bother with normal guard duties, but instead focus on the really crazy ones. I have this, and am heavily inspired by Luther. Relatively normal people that have a lot of experience stopping really bad people, sure they're a bit corrupt, but they're better then nothing.   They have ex warlords, mages, princesses, whatever. Essentially the exact same as a PC except they adhere to the law. How I work it is that in every capitol there is a team of 10 level 15s that just make sure the ""trouble shooters"" don't cause trouble the city guards can't handle. You become a serious town when you can afford to buy a Blue Guard for your small town (all small towns have 1 level 10,potentially more) unless you don't pay your independence tax, then one is outfitted to you, as well as your town leader is replaced by a member of the Lord's Alliance, but that's just world building that's specific to my world.   For the most part, they are anti villains, they stop crazed maniacs. You could sum them up as organized super heroes. They enforce the law, in there own special way."

dndnext,3dvo9k,robklg159,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"Most people are saying never, but it really should depend on the setting, as some have said. And I don't mean the broader world setting, I mean the specific locales the party visits.  In your basic podunk village, mid- or even low-level adventurers may be able to get away with acting like they own the place, at least for a time. Eventually, someone from the village might find a hero or a stronger authority to appeal to to deal with the PCs...  ... but think about it. If every town and village had the resources to consistently deal with every mid-level threat, there wouldn't be much need for heroes, now would there? And even with a fair amount of heroic intervention or a strong law-keeping order present, in anything but a utopia, a lot of injustices and offenses are going to slip through the cracks, including some of the PCs' more cavalier actions. Police and kings have limited resources and will tend to devote them to either addressing the most dire and heinous threats, or doing the easier or more pedestrian things to maintain order (going for the low-hanging fruit). Confronting a group of powerful adventurers over some misdemeanors or breaches in protocol usually isn't going to be high on the local police chief's to-do list.  So while the PCs shouldn't be allowed to behave wantonly without consequence in most games, I also think in most games there's an underlying assumption that should be kept in mind, and that is that part of the appeal of D&D is that it's a power fantasy. The PCs should be able to throw their weight around a little, or sometimes even a lot without having to stress too much about a bigger fish swimming by.  You still have to maintain tension in the game means having to have credible threats that the PCs fear, and to keep the game compelling there should always be another goal to strive forward, until the endpoint of the campaign... but as long as those aspects are present in the primary plots of the campaign, you can give your players some latitude in how much they need to respect the locals and their laws and traditions.  Hope this helps."

It's up to the DM to give alternate ones, but I've had my players roll Athletics (Constitution) checks for more long-term trials, such as running or swimming great distances.  Most of the checks you come across will be Athletics (Strength) checks, but there might be others.  This also applies to other skills, so for example, Medicine (Intelligence) might come into play rather than the normal Medicine (Wisdom)."
dndnext,3dw4qc,x-p3rimental,4,Mon Jul 20 13:35:41 2015 UTC,"While I definitely agree that some 'athletic' actions aren't necessarily strength based, the Athletics skill is specifically Athletics (Strength). If you want to make the check about their ability to physically endure the action, it's just a Constitution check (or save depending).   A similar situation is Acrobatics (Dex). Tumbling around an obstacle or swinging from chandelier to chandelier absolutely requires some strength, but it's not a strength check. If it was, you'd be talking about Athletics.  At the end of the day, the difference is whether you're adding your proficiency bonus to the check for being trained in the skill instead of just your natural talent so you can definitely houserule that some training carries over to other aspects of the task. RAW though, the skills are tied to specific attributes and other ability checks don't benefit from proficiency."

So i had her fight first and then took her back to the animals where 3 thugs basically grappled her and took her back. She got branded as a Slave.  Because they are slavers also. The rest of the group had to free her.   I gave her a ton of chances to break free also. She kept on failing her rolls.   Then later on another part they were investigating why the temple all of sudden turned some of them away in the middle of the night. So they found out dopplegangers have taken over. But one got away during the fight. They go straight to the town guard  and guess the guard captain is a doppleganger too! And its not something I sprung on them.  I've tried dropping subtle hints that something is not right about her before they even did this.  They met her once then saw her again and was well rude to them and told them to get out of town.  Then the 3rd time with the dopplegangers and guess what they got locked up hahah. Of course they still don't suspect she's one until they find the escape route out of the jail to where the ""real"" people are being held.   But again they were upset that I had disarmed them, and captured them.

dndnext,3dwpre,ray_ragnarok_,3,Mon Jul 20 04:29:48 2015 UTC,"To add to this, single-player game DMs should be cautious and remember to keep everything appropriately scaled-down, and be more forgiving, and fudge the rolls in the favor of the player slightly more often. Encouraging some kind of Hireling mechanic and including variant rules like optional Healing Surge are also personal recommendations of mine, from experience. You don't want this person to feel too overpowered, but you also want them to have a good chance of surviving to tell the tale."

She played a 6th lvl human male, way of the shadow mnk.  He was sent to a cave by her monastery.  People who go there have been gone missing and never come back.   He thinks to himself ""Why do people go to cave? Just stay away  from cave and you won't go missing!""  So they explore the cave it is diverse but eventually an opening with some bones in it. A displacer beast pops out!   A few rounds go by and the beast dies.   Thinking they found the source of the issue as they're leaving they are ambushed by Kobolds!   One shoots an arrow which the monk catches and throws back killing the kobold that shot it.   The other kobolds cower and says IT IS THE DRAGON WARRIOR!!!!   The monk says ""Yes! Yes I AM! Now take me to your leader!""   They say oh yes we must take you to the oh ever great red-dragon. He will be pleased that we have brought him a warrior!!!   So they take the monk to a door and then scurry off.   The monk walks through the door and see's a long path way with lava on either side of it. At the end of the walkway is a half-red dragon.  They fight as they're fighting it sprouts wings and eventually the monk kills it.  He looks threw some papers the halfdragon had on the table and it shows he was doing research to figure out how to become a true full dragon!  So he explores the cave some more to find people. He comes across cages with people in them and its other monks from his order.   They come to realize that this was all a trap and that the Master monk is the BBEG and is wanting to become a shadow dragon somehow.   So they go back to town and confront the Master monk. He is shimmering and shadowy....They fight he uses a necrotic breath weapon and then also summons shadow counter parts to fight the NPC monks (not running them but just description)  Then the evil dude sprout wings flys about the temple and trys to fly-charge the monk but misses. The monk then see's that the sunlight is hurting him more so he pushes the evil dude outside, at which point the evil dude is gone and all the other shadows fall.  Order is restored to the temple but....All the monks are missing their way of the shadow powers!!!   Thats where we ended.   But yeah it was fun, there some more funny dialog details and such.  But yeah 1 player and 1 adventure!"

While the low-level ability for natural flight is quite useful, on a medium sized creature it still has heavy restrictions. Difficult to fly indoors, and impossible without room for her wingspan (this goes for underground as well, in cases of spelunking or dungeon crawling). Also the fact that she is humanoid in shape, and clearly seen as a spellcaster makes her a target, flying or not.  Being able to transform into a tiny flying creature, though, like a hawk? Plenty of room for maneuverability, even indoors/underground. And who would suspect a hawk of casting Call Lightning against them? (Cast spell, maintain concentration, and Animal Shape into a tiny bird that flies around the battlefield maintaining lightning bolt strikes at enemies!)  Flying itself isn't terribly powerful. Flying and disguising oneself as an unassuming wild animal? Pretty potent, if you know how to use it."

dndnext,3dx5u0,t0beyeus,3,Mon Jul 20 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"I think a good way to homebrew it would be that the Druid (Land or Moon) must pick from the Land list. This grants 2 additional forms. Just limit it so that they cannot concentrate on a spell in these forms because they are not skilled enough to do so.

I wouldn't want to do this regularly, but used sparingly and in proper context with the setting, it's ok.  I can always design puzzles where flying and swimming doesn't help... underground with solid floors and low ceilings. In a homebrew campaign or adventure, this is never an ongoing issue -- I adapt what I present to the players depending on their abilities and styles."

dndnext,3dx7ib,JJxBiggy,4,Mon Jul 20 07:38:55 2015 UTC,"Well I think of it like this. Sure Barbarians have abilities A and B but they dont have abilities C and D. Casters might have abilities C and D but you want your caster to have A, C and D? It would make sense if you multi-classed in to barbarian and instead of using strength it could manifest through your magical ability instead possibly but have the same limitations as strength-based rage"
dndnext,3dx7ib,WizzardofAus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:10:26 2015 UTC,"I did consider just multi-classing barbarian warlock to get rage but i can't cast spells in rage. My DM won't budge on that rule no matter how much I beg lol. I don't see magical rage as taking a from martial classes and just gluing it onto arcane classes, rather I see it as making magic more volatile and dangerous. IMO sorcerers are not the magic barbarians that they were in 3.5/Pathfinder, and I just wanted to breath life into the magic classes in 5e. I do like the compromise though. It is definitely something I will use in my games from now on. :)"
dndnext,3dx7ib,WizzardofAus,2,Mon Jul 20 08:25:16 2015 UTC,"Thats why I was suggesting the alteration of rage. Like you would be a Caster 5/Barbarian 1 for mechanics but you alter the flavour of it so you arent using a barbarians rage, you are using a homebrewed casters equivelant, just taking the dip so it doesnt unbalance things too much"

dndnext,3dx7ib,jmartkdr,4,Mon Jul 20 08:47:20 2015 UTC,TL;DR Why can't I go avatar state in dnd!
dndnext,3dx7ib,Avex4,3,Mon Jul 20 07:42:07 2015 UTC,"Ahh that's what you're looking for!  To me, rage mage always seemed like a silly idea, casting is supposed to be an act of serious mental discipline and the whole point of rage is that you stop using your brain and let your blood take over.  The main reason this mechanic doesn't exist in DnD is because going nova and burning all you power in one encounter is already a problem for game balance: you would be vastly more powerful for one fight and then noticeably less so for the rest of the adventuring day. But that's not really balanced, because a) being unbalanced in every fight means you're never actually balanced and b) it encourages the '15 minute workday' where players try to take a long rest after every fight, which both weakens any class that doesn't really fully on spell slots and makes balancing a lot harder on dm's since fights well over the party's level tend to become much more subject to the randomness of the dice. (in other words, players are more likely to die because the dm rolled well as opposed to because they did something stupid)  If you make the avatar state not overpowered, then you're non-avatar state becomes underpowered,  which means you need to use it each encounter, at which point it's not mechanically significant. If the non-avatar state version of the character is reasonably balanced, then the avatar state is overpowered or the avatar state is insignificant.  TL;DR: stuff that works great in fixed narratives like tv shows is often terribly unbalanced in an actual game."
dndnext,3dx7ib,captaindaximus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"This is a good point, but I don't mean to cast spells as a barbarian would swing his battleaxe in a rage. I was thinking of more when put under a state of great duress a warlock or sorcerer (classes that don't really require the serious mental discipline to cast their spells) would be thrown into this instinctual fury of destruction without prejudice.  I see this mechanic as being more of a harm to your party-mates than a benefit, A mage that is at heart a ticking time bomb that can go off at any minute is more along the lines of what I was thinking. I feel if it's not in the players control when she rages it would be more of a interesting plot point than a mechanical point. I probably should have worded the question better TBH."

dndnext,3dx7ib,moonshadowkati,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:28:40 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the intent of the Middle Finger of Vecna, but to me it seems that all their content is wildly unbalanced.   As a DM, I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole.   At second glance, this Archetype doesn't look too bad, although extremely MAD. It's Barbarian meets Eldritch Knight. Using Wisdom to cast Wizard spells is also strange.   I would recommend an Eldritch Knight or Bladelock and lots of good roleplaying to capture the image of a raging mage."
dndnext,3dx7ib,captaindaximus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:24:24 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. But honestly the stuff wizards releases these days in UA is arguably no more or less balanced and we get a paragraph per month.   These guys come up with something every few days and its at least inspiration for personal homebrew/balance.  Rage mage seems fine to me, I think it probably does perform better than other Barb sub-classes, but on a player by player basis should be fine as long as your DM doesn't mind multiclass barbarians. I would have much preferred if it used int like EK/AT to make int slightly more useful, but int barbarians seem strange"
dndnext,3dx7ib,moonshadowkati,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of Charisma based barbarians. The force of their rage and personality would channel their magic.   Here is how I would refluff the Warlock Class and play him like a Barbarian, all within Core rules.   Perhaps a bladelock with a greataxe. Hex could be refluffed to targeting an opponent as the source of your rage. Temp HP represents the bloodlust sinking in. Eldritch Blast takes the form of mystical spears or throwing axes. The Patron could be an ancestor spirit or a god of war.   It wouldn't be as durable as a regular barbarian, but a regular barbarian couldn't recharge their spell slots on a short rest and cast fireball.   It's all about the roleplaying :)"

Although, some stores may end up having all their tables full. When you find a local store that is hosting Encounters, you could go in and talk to them about how full their Encounters nights are. They may have all the tables they have DMs for filled, but, still have tables left over, if they had more DMs.  If you are familiar with 5th Edition enough to DM it, you could offer to DM another table.  there's a subreddit for it at https://www.reddit.com/r/AdventurersLeague/."

Charisma does NOT mean you are physically attractive. Just look at the mind flayer. They have a 17 charisma. But would you wanna hit that? Not unless you have a tentacle fetish.   Charisma is more your personality than it is your looks. You can have a high charisma and be uglier than sin, but people will still listen to you when you speak. Conversely, you can be drop dead gorgeous, but lack any personality and be boring as hell. If someone is good at talking, they likely have a good charisma score."

Maybe there's a famine in town and they need to quest for food. Maybe gold counterfeiters have forced the region to return to a barter system.    It's not fun to have a DM tell you you need to spend the gold you had earmarked for new shoes on keeping yourself from starving. It really feels like a tax on fun.    If you want the immersion, I'd recommend making the system transparent but automatic. That means saying up front, ""ok, you guys want to stay in a nice room in a crappy Inn and eat modest meals. That will be X gold a day, and I'll deduct it off your treasure haul.    Also: 1 ration is a days worth of food. Actually playing out multiple meals would probably slow action to a crawl."

During downtime or roleplay in a city I use this as a basic guide.  When adventuring away I make sure everyone has stocked up on rations. I usually set it at a relatively simple 1 set of rations per day that they consume over the course of a couple short rests and a long rest (they don't have to tell me they consume it). If they take 5 days worth of rations and they're coming up on day 6 or 7 (i might let them stretch the rations), then I tell them they have to start making survival checks or find another means. If they take 5 days worth of rations and make it back to town w/in about 3 days, I remind them as soon as they get back that they'll need to stock up before adventuring out again and tell them to not on their sheets that they consumed X amount of rations while out.   TLDR: I don't account for it day-by-day, but I keep a general idea of where they're at and throw challenges or expenses at them accordingly."

It even inspired one player in my group to save up and buy a milk goat (which they named Elvira) that they bring around with them that can provide goat milk to supplement their rations or to make goat cheese to do the same.

My suggestion would be to do a bit of that so it's established, and particularly early in the campaign when it matters.  Later when they've got enough money it doesn't matter, than I'd just come up with a monthly or weekly amount they have to pay for living expenses.

If they do, I'd start them with basic supplies and tell them when they are getting hungry. At that point, they have to figure out how to get food out of the supplies/resources they have available.

dndnext,3dvfbr,jmartkdr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"I'll offer some, sounds fun:   Concept is great.  Some piece of Chaos itself that comes through the planar guardians and powers that protect the world and in rending through?  There's now a rain (metaphorical here--mystical/magical/otherly) that falls on the world breeding and instigating evil forces and beings--all to reclaim it.  That's target rich.  I would even offer that this doesn't have to be cursed (in the traditional sense).  That can be known, up front, and even considered a feature not just a bug.  It's a strong magic item (those should be rare enough anyway) and it draws the eye of evil things--fine.  But if they get it back, it could be calamatous or not.  It becomes an item a PC might not just carry, but also one they may (with story reasons) try to find a way of safely returning--closing the gash between worlds. I really advocate not making a whole crazy bunch of effects.  Chaotic doesn't have to mean plentiful.  Chaotic just has to mean unpredictable (that's just me).  I don't want (myself) to make an item with 111 properties, potentially.  I want to make one with a few that the user simply cannot consistently rely on.  Simple.  Interesting.   Example:  +2 wondrous item (because it really is just a chunk of wood, or to better represent your Chaos thing, it's a substance that almost shifts and bends and changes and it's almost like wood, but sometimes feels warm and soft like flesh, sometimes hard and smooth like glass... almost shifting).  Once attuned, it leeches off the PC, defining itself based on some deep affinity and turns into a weapon of a particular kind--this makes it personal to a PC, but without giving them agency in making it take shape as it's reaching into their essence and mimicking something there and the PC doesn't control that--although it means that with character development, the DM might change the weapon and in changing it the PC now wonders what happened to /themselves/.    From there, +2 is strong--but clear and seemingly certain (orderly).  Make it a +0 to +3.  That's 4 choices.  On an attack, they roll a d20 as normal.  They add their bonuses (character based) as normal.  But with that d20, they throw a d4.  On a 1, it's a+1.  On a 2, a +2.  On a 3, a +3 (they get excited about this possibility).  But on a 4, it loses itself in its own chaotic power, tipping it's magical might past the point of being anchored in this world and while looking brilliant and almost exploding with energies, they are otherworldly energies and too much and the weapon is a +0 in this plane.  Every attack, it's a ""magic weapon"" for resistance purposes no matter what... and they're going to get a +0 through a +3.  Average on that is only +1.5 per swing.  Slightly less than a +2, sure, but it then ""feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeels"" chaotic.  So, past that, as they own it, as they level, as the thing more and more attunes to them and is more and more removed from it's origins it loses more and more of its truly chaotic nature.  Maybe every 4 levels or every ""feat/ability score"" opportunity they get, the bonus becomes less uncertain.  The item is adapting to the world.  First, the +0 option goes away.  On rolling a 4, reroll.  Now it's an even +1, +2, or +3 option and never explodes into insubstantial chaos anymore.  Then, the +1 goes away, 50/50 for a +2 or +3.  Then just a +3, but now the weapon has all but lost its original nature except for wisps and hints of it.    And, on a critical, the weapon aggros every chaotic creature around that fails a Wisdom Save DC equal to half the damage from the crit.  On a success, creature feels an unearthly pull of hatred and wants to (but need not) attack the bearer; the feeling passes at the end of the turn.  On a failure, they immediately launch a furious and reckless and violent assault.  This may require the DM to take an ally's Chaotic Neutral Sorcerer and if they fail that save (because they were in the area), take their sheet, pick the most direct (no care or strategy for the future or self-preservation) method of delivering the maximum amount of damage and take that turn for the player directed at the bearer.  That'd be a weapon I'd imaging a player would be into, use all the time, and always feel uncertain about.    Maybe (for proper legendary status) the ""Wisdom save"" issue and negative effects can be cleansed from it by returning that ember of Chaos back through the rift--they keep the item after and it's got all its magic properties, but the PC got to go on a big epic end-adventure to fix the rend in the world, and the artifact leftover is powerful, but now perfectly earthly.  No random effects anymore."

Also might give you some ideas for what you aim to do.  That said roll20 is fine just make sure you have something for your players to look at. I use a mix of fantasy art and and funny motivational posters. Maybe mix in a little background with appropriate music or noise.   It gets boring staring at a screen of nothing and the game deteriorates fast. Just be sure your players know that it is theatre of mind so they don't expect more.
dndnext,3dvwlj,MhBlis,3,Mon Jul 20 00:17:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed about having something to look at. I read about someone on roll20 who uses a screen of character portraits, or puts up some art of NPCs they're talking to, or a scene-setting photo. Just to set the mood, but everything else is theater of the mind. (Plus then you get the roll20 character sheets to use.)"
dndnext,3dvwlj,PthaloGreen,2,Mon Jul 20 01:17:11 2015 UTC,"TotM Fantasy Grounds works just great.  The map is not actually the centerpiece of FG--it's the chat window/dice box, character sheets, and combat/party trackers.  When we're doing TotM I usually just plop down a blank parchment map and put tokens on it just to give relative positions.  So the two melees are the front line, the casters are behind them, these goblins are engaged with the front line, these goblins are back a bit.  The tokens just make it easier to target, but is by no means needed.  You can also share multiple images and portraits, each appearing in a separate window the players can move individually (or minimize, whatever).  All that out of the way, you can actually buy the PotA adventure module for FG too (WotC published it) and it has every single word, map, portrait, npc, item, encounter, and parcel right there at your fingertips.  The maps are very high quality.  So you've got options.  :)"

dndnext,3dugzu,Bilious_Slick,4,Sun Jul 19 16:31:10 2015 UTC,"This is what I would rule, as well. I don't recall an explicit ruling in the PHB or DMG, but if I were DMing, I would require concentration for spells cast using scrolls and items. 1. It keeps the spirit of the game (simple mechanics enforced in part by limited passive effects). 2. It helps to prevent the scroll and item versions of a spell from being straight up better than the versions you cast yourself.  3. It makes some in universe sense to me that even if you aren't concentrating on the casting if the spell, you're still concentrating on channeling the power of the scroll/item."
dndnext,3dugzu,PadicReddit,14,Sun Jul 19 17:09:53 2015 UTC,Here is golden rule number 1 on topics like this: all the normal rules apply to everything you do unless something specifically says otherwise.

The statement that ""if you don't defend it, you lose it"" is true to some extent for trademarks. It is not true in any way about copyright. Basically, if you aren't actively using the D&D Trademark, they don't have an obligation to tell you to stop.  Now, I don't know enough about copyright law to be able to say whether or to what extent creating your own world and your own monsters in the D&D system would be considered copyright infringement, but it certainly could be done without infringing on their trademark. The cases of online tools being taken down have mostly been ones where they were using material from Wizards: detailing spells, rules, etc. Wizards has every right (but no obligation) to issue takedowns in these cases."

Longer answer: there's a few companies doing 3rd party 5e stuff despite any sort of agreement under essentially he same terms that were used to make unofficial add-ins for every other edition.   A publisher needs to respect WotCs trademarks and make sure it's clear that their product isn't claiming to be official. Don't reprint material, so you're probably ok saying 'there is a skeleton in the room' as long as you don't reprint the stats.

Generating the template crashes for some reason sometimes. If you've closed the preview window, then try previewing again without changing anything. If you changed something, it's ok, but otherwise it takes a shit.  The ""Bonus to saving throws"" part needs to be cleaned up and hooked in (it doesn't actually DO anything right now).  Saving and loading of creatures would be a great feature (probably in JSON so I'm saving raw variables and not re-parsing HTML each time).  Saving the preview as HTML/PNG/JPG/BMP/SVG (this was requested).  Add in spellcasting as an attack.  That's all stuff that needs doing. There other other features I'd like.   Being able to output this more like the monster manual as a page with fluff, pictures and whatnot. Saving a 'library' of abilities and attacks for easy use. You can't see it, but the 'attack' panel that pops up needs attending to. It wouldn't let you type in, say, multi-attack (you'd have to do that as an ability) because it automatically assume damage will be done so it assembles the line as any other attack. It's more of a 'it should work this way' but as is, it DOES work.   Plus that UI is horrible. Pressing tab doesn't bring you to the next item, but jumps around a lot (because I've moved controls around)."

Right? My psi points return to 4 after a long rest, right?      Correct, correct. This is explained under the Psi Points and Psi Points maximum sections.   For the Disciplines, it lists an effect followed by a number in brackets, an example being ""Occluded Mind (3)"" from the Conquering Mind. Does that (3) mean that I spend 3 psi points to activate it or does it mean I need to be level 3 to use it?         It means you need to spend 3 psi points to activate. This is explained in the Spending Psi Points section. However, this is a soft level gate because you will not be able to use an ability until you can spend the requisite number of points at once."
dndnext,3dt4do,Zigity_Zagity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:10:03 2015 UTC,"So for Disciplines like Celerity, where it says ""Rapid Reaction (1) : If you are surprised, you can spend 1 psi point to no longer be surprised.""

dndnext,3dt4do,Zigity_Zagity,4,Sun Jul 19 05:20:49 2015 UTC,"Correct. Activating a disciple is a bonus action and costs nothing, so if you had celerity active you'd be able to spend the 1 point and not be surprised, but if it was inactive at the time you couldn't activate celerity and then spend the point, because you need the bonus action to turn it on."
dndnext,3dt4do,Avex4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:43:16 2015 UTC,"What you've said is mostly correct AFAIK.   Not to be a buzzkill, but i would honestly wait for some more content on mystic before actually trying it.  If what you are playing is a short campaign or a 1-shot or simply a test session it should be fine, but the mystic is clearly a very rough draft at this point, and seems extremely unbalanced.  First things, strength of the mind is insane if you are multiclassing into mystic because you simply gain a saving throw of your choice.  Overall, Mystic is ridiculous as a multiclass-1 level dip-for martial classes. Gaining at will effects to concentrate on, a saving throw, and the ability to dash/a magic weapon for a single level seems pretty good.  I'd even take a level of mystic as a casting class. Con saving throws for concentration, medium armor and shields, and celerity so that you gain adv on initiative, and if you run out of spells or want to save spells, being able to dash/disengage seems really good for a caster.  Awakened:   Mind thrust targeting int? literally an auto hit against 95% of monsters if not more. Also spending psi points to increase the damage (must choose to spend points before rolling to hit) becomes extremely awkward if you do manage to miss somehow and you dumped you psi to hit. Paladins can wait to smite until after they see the attack roll, fighters can wait to use maneuvers, hell even psionic weapon users wait to see if they hit. While the ability is almost an auto hit anyway, why do psychics specifically have to choose before rolling?  Psychic mind: actually kinda cool, way stronger than any other at will telepathy at this level, but hey, you are psychic.  Object reading: First- What does hold actually mean? Does the spell do nothing if you can't physically lift the object?  Second-Events? What dm has prepared any material on the past events of whatever random object you have found? In my experience this either leads to a meaningless long explanation about boring material (if the player insists) or a simple ""nothing cool happened"" from the dm, or the dm has planned for you to find something out this way, and you don't  object read the thing he expected. Also 20ft is ridiculously small. What kind of significant event takes place within 20ft of the same object?   Third- You can set a gps tracker and a security camera on anything for a 10 minute cast time (at will) so why wouldnt you. Can you differentiate between all your gps pings?  Disciplines  Conquering mind-(AKA pick this one) Good concentration effect, each ability seems useful at different levels.   Intellect Fortress-A pretty good feature, but why does this discipline only have a concentration effect, and no actual way to spend psi points besides psi-smiting.  Third Eye-For this one i might be confused as to the intended effect, but i will reference a  discussion i read discussing the difference between the ""sights"" and for all intensive purposes i see no real reason to need tremorsense or truesight when blindsight appears to cover the same bases.  Immortal  Durable Mind-Cant lose concentration, but as its only a bonus action to activate disciplines and you can do it all will, this feature is a nice perk i suppose, but not nearly as good as it would be for a spellcaster.  Martial order-pretty simple  Psionic Regen-Ridiculous. The fact that its regaining hit points and not temp hp means you cant be KOed. Even if its only 1-2 hit points it still means as long as you can pass the one death saving throw on your turn you just get up at the end of it. The actual healing is completely insignificant in the long run, and its only convincing your DM to outright slay you while you are down. Or you get stuck in this constant zombie phase where you get KOed, you get up on 1, you get KOed before it gets around to you, over and over.  Disciplines  Celerity-Pretty good, really strong concentration effect because you definitely arent worried about keeping it up after you roll initiative except to spend PP, and surge of speed is insanely strong IMO. (Bonus action-1 PP- Dash and you dont provoke AoO with the dash or any other movement.)  Iron Durability- Not bad, but not as good as the others. The only discipline where none of the PP activations are bonus actions so you can always activate the discipline and use any of its features in the same turn.  Psionic Weapon- Definitely good. Magic weapon from level 1, Druids/monks get this feature at level 6 and dont even get the +1 hit/damage. Ethereal weapon has potential to be very good too, half damage on miss is always good, and targetting a different stat is always good. Lethal strike is pretty simple, not bad. Augmented weapon is honestly dumb in 5e where magic items are more rare than in previous editions. Bounded accuracy makes the bonus to hit pretty good.  TL;DR- Mystic clearly isnt finished, and felt clunky during play, some of the features seem pointless."
dndnext,3dt4do,LexieJeid,4,Sun Jul 19 07:17:19 2015 UTC,"The whole point of the psionic material is to test it. OP is doing it for a ""test run"". WotC needs accurate feedback at the end of the month, not speculation from people who didn't actually try it out."

dndnext,3dt4do,donttalknojive,3,Sun Jul 19 19:37:32 2015 UTC,"I understand your apprehensions, there are some clunky aspects to Mystic at the moment.  A lot of that has to do with poor wording that will be refined.    As for balance, keep in mind that these are the Mystic's only class features, meaning they have ludicrously minor utility.  One discipline at a time, and a very limited pool of resources.  Once the points are gone, they have either bad regen and a +1 weapon, or telepathy and a near autohit 1d8 cantrip.  Compared to any other L5, that's a joke.  Wizards recover spell slots and have scaling cantrips, Warlocks have an epic cantrip, Druids can shillelagh or shift, Sorcerers have Font of Magic and good cantrips.  There's no equivalent of gimped characters without their main resource.  I see the psion as an active playstyle class with a risk-reward curve that is very harsh.    The immortal's regen ability won't save it vs. a big threat, but provides survivability that it needs as a melee class with only medium armor and no class features.  Still, it should be reworded to be less forgiving during ko.  We'll wait and see how it changes over time."
dndnext,3dt4do,Avex4,3,Sun Jul 19 15:24:21 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I think the class has too little utility and hope that in the next iteration mystic is more fully formed.
dndnext,3dt4do,kyoujikishin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:38:17 2015 UTC,"I kind of like how they paced the mystic class so far. Though some things still definitely need to be refined and balanced.

I'll ask how the first character responds to this; it's pretty insulting, if you think about it. Don't they trust you when you said nothing was in the bed? Do they think you're too stupid to effectively search a bed? Sometimes I'll use this to discourage metagaming by having them initiate an in-game dialog about ""why would you search that after me?""  Other times I just kinda say no. ""She just searched that, you have no reason to."" I'm lucky enough to have players that typically do their best to avoid metagaming, though."

You want to keep it as dynamic as possible. If there's nothing important, or something obvious in the room that you want to have found, you should handwave the moment for the sake of brevity. However, if there's something like, I dunno, an empty vial of poison in a signet ring in a locked jewelery box in a hidden compartment and then you'll have another clue to who the murderer is, yeah that should take some rolling."
dndnext,3dt03c,The_Wingless,3,Sun Jul 19 13:33:41 2015 UTC,"The more specific my players get, the better their chances are.  If they just enter a room and say they search it, the DC will be let's just say 15. If they start giving details and the details might match up with things then I'll drop the dc a tiny bit.  Searching for doors specifically will drop the dc if there are doors to find. Searching the wardrobe nearby will drop the dc if there is stuff hidden in there.  That's how I typically handle it."
dndnext,3dt03c,Pseud0pod,2,Sun Jul 19 04:38:11 2015 UTC,"For searching the room for anything not readily visible we use Perception.  There's a DC for anything hidden in the room.  Anyone who doesn't actively search just has their passive Perception applied.    We use Investigation if someone wants to thoroughly search or scrutinize something they've already spotted in the room.  A player might ask about a device or unusual object they see, and the DM may ask for an Investigation vs. a DC to determine if they can figure out its significance or how to operate it.  Or, if someone wants to search an object for anything interesting or valuable the DM will sometimes ask for an investigation to determine what they find.  This isn't usually a ""pass or fail the DC"" roll since you'll generally always find something.  But, it can mean I search a bookshelf and grab a trashy romance novel instead of noticing a book detailing a useful ritual spell, or someone searching a jewelry box fails to notice a rare gem amongst the costume jewelry."

dndnext,3dt03c,Cyclenophus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:48:05 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for something in one of my games, be specific. Based on the individual Passive Perception scores of players, I may describe minor things in rooms that could constitute as unusual, and warrant further investigation, but not always. You'd still have to do an active Perception or Investigate skill check on those areas to find the actual secret. I usually limit it so that only one or two people can attempt this, as I mentally raise the DC every time someone fails until it's effectively at 30."
dndnext,3dt03c,quantumprophecy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:56:31 2015 UTC,"I've really tried to move away from making my players do a ton of search rolls. I feel like it eats up so much time and just leads them to Meta game to much. If they saw one of them roll low on a search check they would all just want to reroll.  I handle it as such: when you walk into a room, you can see the entire room. Ill give moderate details about what's in it, and if you want more specific details about something, just ask. If I mention there's a painting on the wall, its up to the players to ask me further details about it to reveal its of a historical figure PR something. Again, no roll required.  If a player wants to search a bed or dresser, they just tell me to do it. No roll required. Anyone who was going to search a dresser is going to go through all the drawers and look at the papers or ect. that's in it. Perception here doesn't really make sense. Now if there was a hidden compartment in the dresser, I might make them roll to see if they found it during their search, but its still possible for them to find pertinent information during a search that didn't require a roll.  The last cases are hidden doors and traps. Hidden doors use passive perception unless you are very specifically checking g a portion of a wall. Traps are simple. You declare where you are looking for traps, a hallway, a chest, a door, whatever. You then roll. If you succeed, you spot the trap and can then figure out how to disarm it. If you fail the search check, you trigger the trap, but usually only on your self and not on the whole party."
dndnext,3dt03c,TheWebCoder,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:43:59 2015 UTC,Yeah my group usually works together to search . The one with the best perception does a general scan while the others investigate objects or bodies
dndnext,3dt03c,Koosemose,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:14:18 2015 UTC,"I leave it up to my players, sort of. If they tell me they want to basically tear apart the room looking for something, then it's a wisdom (perception), but this will be at the cost of time, depending on the size of the room and the amount of stuff, this could take anywhere from a minute to ten minutes (or really any amount of time if you allow a wide enough range of room sizes and stuff packed into said room). If they want to search in a particular place (say they're only interested in finding a book), then they again roll wisdom(perception) and it takes less time. If they'd prefer to try to figure out the most likely place for items of interest, it's Intelligence(investigation) which will take much less time, but potentially be much more difficult, depending on how reasonable the locations of items of interest are, further modified by how familiar they  with the posessor of said item (say they're searching for a book in a goblin's hideout, normally it's location in the kitchen would be less expected, but knowing goblins have little care for books, it would be easier to deduce that it may be there for future use to start a cooking fire, whereas if it's in a duke's kitchen, that would be harder to deduce unless they know enough about the duke to deduce that perhaps he enjoy's reading to his wife while she cooks), it's not a precise ""let's cross-reference this on chart g2"" sort of thing more of a general feel of the oddity of the location and how well they know of the posessor. I'll even allow them to mix, a somewhat easier int(investigation) to get the general area, and a somewhat quicker wis(perception) to search that area thoroughly, or even one member of the party using int(investigation) to assign different party members different locations, where they roll wis(perception) to search thoroughly.  In short, I let the party choose how they search, and I assign the type of check, DC, and time required as I feel appropriate for how they're searching."

The first is the sanguine heart staff. it is a +1 staff and has three abilities: 1: it can reduce the amount of healing done by cure or inflict spells cast by the wielder and store those points in a pool. the maximum amount that can be stored in the pool is 10 x the wielders lvl.  2:  As an action the pool can be spent to heal or harm a touch creature. the most you can expend from the pool in a single use is capped at 5 x the wielders lvl.   3: instead of using a spell slot the wielder can expend a hit die and 3 hp to cast cure wounds or inflict wounds. for every lvl above first that you cast the spell it costs an additional 3 hp and a hit die.  The second is really cool, but takes a lot of time to explain. It is a gem that can absorb light to gain charges and those charges can be expended to do Lightbringer style color magic. It can only store 8 charges at a time and after it has used 24 charges is crumbles to dust. There is a lot of Dm player back and forth on what it can actually do, but it's pretty cool and inventive players can have a field day with it.  The last one i didn't really have a good name for it, so my players ended up just calling it the shadow sword. it's a +1 longsword that does an extra d6 of necrotic (shadow) damage and gives the player resistance to necrotic damage.

With Great Weapon Master he usually ends up getting to string the kill with another attack afterwards (double kills are the best).    I'd say encourage your players.  When they reduce something to 0 hp, tell them to describe their kill.  It might be tough at first, but they'll get the hang of it and look forward to it once they know it's coming.  You can describe how the villains do it whenever you want, so give them good examples!  Lead the way!"

I narrated the stroke, the emotional stakes, and the impact of the kill. We weren't at the table to solve math problems. We came to the table to tell an epic story.  Once they got a feel for my narrative style, I would ask them to describe their kill on their own. Their faces lit up and they seized the reigns. They explained the scenes with passion and excitement. I sat back and watched my players become master storytellers.   TL;DR Lead by example, then sit back and watch your players shine."

It's impressive that you can really change the way the class ""feels"" without changing the rules.  I'm currently playing a cleric that's actually pretty straight forward, but if I made a new one I might try one of these versions instead.  What's really impressive though is the story.  It's more like a mini-novella!  I particularly love the way the spells are described.  I never realized mage hand could seem so cool!    Even if you aren't all that in to clerics, read the story!

High Ranking Clerics know of this.  The Cleric in the group made a deal with his Goddess (the goddess of life) a long time ago before they went missing, to stop aging, so he has been alive a long time.  She allowed it even though it goes against the course of nature and life, because of his devout service; but also because he questions her decisions on certain things.  He believes that resurrections, and undead aren't completely unnatural or evil, as they can happen through the use of magic which is natural, which goes against her fundamental belief in the life-cycle of life and death.  Basically she agreed to keep him around, breaking her own self-rule as Goddess of Life and Nature, to have a follower that acts for her, without just blind devotion, who will question her and make sure she is doing what is actually Right and Good for life (all living things) in general, and not just her Godly belief of how life SHOULD be.  The gods were a bit, haughty and arrogant and didn't understand the living races due to their immortal nature and coming from another plane of existence, and used the living beings for power (by gaining followers).

The bit about getting power from gods' lieutenants is similar to what I'm doing with divine seneschals in my setting, The Vorago, but I like your particular spin on that approach. I also like the idea that high-level clerics know more of the secrets of how gods interact with clerics than low-level clerics do -- that's how it should be. (In the Vorago setting, the gods' names aren't known except to clerics who have achieved 10th level and the Divine Intervention feature. Most people refer to the gods through epithets like ""The King of Tomes"" and ""The Baseless Beast."")  It looks like your message got cut off mid-sentence. What did I miss?"

It's quite fun for him and I (the cleric), to play because he knows all these little secrets about it, but doesn't know everything.  It also has to balance well in the game world because of his In-Game knowledge, people finding out the Gods are gone would cause chaos in the world, so he has to go about pretending they are still there.  It's refreshing for me to have a character who is so in-depth in the gods, because I always run homebrew campaigns and people don't typically care too much, but this guy (who is usually just a ""I smack it with my sword - Fighter"" is really getting into his cleric).  Thanks to that it requires a lot more development and thought into how the gods work and interact and how their clerics run things in our plane.  It's also quite enjoyable, as his cleric happened to be a follower of the god of life, when the Lieutenant of the god of Death is currently the BBEG (on our plane, they campaign will end in the gods plane of existence eventually).  So he is directly contrary to the bad guy, and sort of makes it easy to force the interaction of the story, as my players are usually Sand-boxers who just do whatever they feel like."

In character creation the first recommended method of creating characters is randomly rolling 4d6 and dropping the lowest. Hypothetically speaking you could roll a set of four 1's and play a character with 3 intelligence. I don't know anyone who still rolls up characters that way but it too has made it in multiple editions of the rules and exists in 5e too.

dndnext,3ds7m6,garner_adam,4,Sun Jul 19 00:16:59 2015 UTC,Yes this is an oversight of 5th edition by placing those classic creatures as just stat blocks in the appendix. These in other editions of D&D were considered allies of elves and could speak languages. Here's their stat blocks from 3rd edition. You'll note that even in 5th edition the Giant Owl and Giant Eagle have languages in their stat blocks. If remember correctly in prior editions you needed at least 3 intelligence to be capable of speaking a language. Though 3 intelligence did not necessarily give one the ability to speak it was a prerequisite for speech.   edit: I will admit however that they seemed to have lightened up with the 1-2 intelligence for animals. I was surprised to see a blood hawk for example at 3. Though overall it still seems pretty consistent. Considering that it may be that the new intended limit for animals is 3. If it can talk it will have a strong intelligence score and there's a few notable exceptions like great Apes.  http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/owlGiant.htm  http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/eagleGiant.htm

A player and I have come up with a series of multiple-choice questions to ask each player that forms a skeleton, or sparks the imagination, for their background.  We've tried it on one player and it worked brilliantly.  They went from:   ""I'm a Duergar, I like to bash things, I have a puppy that I rescued""   to:   ""I was born and raised as a child slave, working in a mine deep in the Underdark.  At a young age I made my first kill, a child bully in the mine - I stood up to him to protect someone weaker.  The crime was never solved by the masters, though they remained suspicious.  I showed a natural talent for smithing which was identified by the masters, eventually I was taken on as an apprentice under a famous smith - unimaginable for someone of my background.  For many years I worked under my master, crafting everything from bolts to swords and armour.  In secret I was working on a personal project, a helm with the face of a dog, with which I hoped to impress my master.  I came back to the forge one day and found my master murdered.. in a panic I fled to avoid being blamed for the death.  I fled ever-upwards, and ended up in the surface world, where almost immidiately I stumbled across a new-born puppy next to it's dead mother.. surely a sign.""   So for the two players I've got detailed backgrounds for, it's ridiculously easy for me to tie their background into the story.  There is a ton of stuff I can do.

He was a warblade and had maneuvers to cast a weapon on fire for extra damage. He had two weapon fighting with a short sword and a gauntlet. The fist encounter these shadows attacked my PC's that were magically summoned and he crits his fire punch and destroys one instantly! The he just shouts out, ""I AM NASH, COMMANDER OF FIRE!""   Later on, ironically, he got knocked out in a fight and one of his beloved Alchemist's Fires broke and killed him and one other PC, and set a house on fire. Luckily in the campaign I was running if you get a PC back to the stone circle they started in they are brought back to life. So they get back and the land bridge they took off the island is flooded with high tide. And after lugging the heaviest 2 PC's back my ranger turns to the Druid.  Ranger: ""Fuck, do you have any spells to get us across.""  Druid(Looks at sheet): Hmmm. . . Nope. Oh, but I have create water!  Ranger(Intense staring): You mean we could have avoided all of this?!

Don't think them getting an Extra Attack makes much sense as they don't really amplify their own martial prowess much, but why not.  From what I understand about Flanking, as long as they have a single dice left they can constantly grant advantage to an ally. This is broken. Advantage is very powerful and not giving it some kind of limitation or drawback (beyond needing to save a dice) is not balanced in my eyes."

Very cliche as it starts (don't want to overwhelm them with something super crazy). The kings messenger is on the streets proclaiming that the princess has been kid napped by a former jester who has been raised from the dead. (magic is illegal). If you can bring the head of the jester and bring the princess back alive you will receive nobility.   Spoilers are next. After doing some exploring and mystery solving you discover that the jester is hidden away in the mountains. Short dungeon crawl later and you find him and the princess. The jester tries to explain to you that he did not capture the princess, she paid for the zombie and ran away with him because she was trying to avoid her father because she is a budding sorcerer. (magics illegal remember). The jester was killed by the king because he was practicing magic (and teaching the princess in secret).

They are at a ""rest-stop"" of sorts, that is also a small trading post between two communities (this works for any DnD world you want to use or create on your own).  During the night the rest-stop is attacked, the players are encouraged to figure out the matter, or even asked/paid to depending on how ""let's do this!"" they are.  You can use any kind of credible threat from any Campaign world pre-made or not.  The typical ones I have are:    Undead rising (skeletons, zombies, I made a sort of skeletal-fire war-horse mini boss)  Bandit Attack (archers, melee's, one ""support"" magic user, and a leader)  Group of wander Gnolls (orcs could work too)  Rival country/lord milita   This works because it ties them into the setting immediately, you just get a few small details like ""why is your character travelling.""  Give them a small synopsis of the area so they know whats there and why their personal character would be there.  The typical play-through involves something like this:  The trade post is under attack, the guards (usually 2 weak human-types) are going out to fight it.  Give them a few minutes to role-play get their bearings, before they hear a horn.  Someone runs in and says they are evacuating.  Evacuation commences, players leave, the attacking force sends a few people after the fleeing ""civilians.""  Players are encouraged to defend them, but they can just keep running.  People Regroup, one guard survived and is severely injured.  He says some people were left behind and he worries for their safety, asks for them to go back and try to find them. (Offers payment if your players are stubborn).  The survivors of the attack either look at the players and thank them for helping them escape or hate them for leaving them to die.  Go back and fight at the small trade-post, find 3 civilians, they are to help them escape in the combat.  If they demanded payment for this job, they get paid per civilian saved (more incentive to not just murder).  I tend to at this point find a way for the attacking force to destroy this entire place, because the first few times I ran it, the people wanted to (after having all the civilians flee and killing all the baddies), loot it, and blame it on the attackers; This is also why undead work, because typically undead don't really care about things that have monetary value"

The odds of getting multiple rolls of 7 or less is higher than getting an 18, so overall, while it may not be much better than normal, it's not hurting them overall, and it's eliminating the outliers, leaving everyone's character with unique stats while eliminating huge disparities between characters.

dndnext,3dqvmd,jwbjerk,9,Sun Jul 19 03:46:44 2015 UTC,"Rolling is, generally, bad. It forces players to play characters they don't want to at its worst, and that is something every table should strive to avoid.  The things that DMs often suggest that it fixes, it only makes worse.   It makes for more interesting characters   This is flat out false. It makes for better characters, and bad characters. The guy who rolled average on all his die ( 11 ) gets to be miserable with less HP, lower saves, lower to hit and lower damage. While the guy who rolled 16+ on 4 stats gets to play a Paladin/Rogue/Bard/Monk and have lots of fun because his bad build is supported with stats that are higher than what the game expects. and shut down other players from effecting the game inside and outside of combat because he has a crazy number of tools to play with from Control Spells, to expertise skills, to stats to back up attempts.  This gives the player who rolled badly two choices: convince the DM to let him reroll ( making the point of rolling in the first place invalid ) or suicide his character for a better one. Hardly interesting.   Point Buy characters are ""by the book"" and boring   This isn't true at all. Even if every wizard came out with the exact same starting spread, those characters will not be the same. Race, skill choices, wizard schools and background will all lead to different characters. It doesn't make sense for a 12 Int character to attempt to be the party Wizard. That isn't an ""interesting"" character, it is a bad character. Less prepared spells and less effective spells isn't fun.   You can't have interesting characters without bad stats   I don't even get this one. Interesting characters come from concepts and player roleplay, not your stats. Your starting stats just let you roll the dice, not be interesting."
dndnext,3dqvmd,Hasire,4,Sat Jul 18 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those arguments have always bothered me. I guess they're from people who roll first and use the stats as inspiration, which I guess I can understand, but they always seem to think that's how it works for everyone - they have this concept that stats make the character.   If that's the case how can people write interesting characters in books with no stats?? They're right, point buy does not create ""interesting"" stats - but why is that so important!

dndnext,3dqvmd,WizzardofAus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:30:49 2015 UTC,"Back in college, our DM came up with one of the most convoluted ways for determining stats, but it ended up creating some of our most memorable characters and one of the better campaigns I've played in (it helped that everyone bought in to his method).   About a week before we were supposed to start the campaign, the DM called a meeting to go over world background, a few homebrew rules, and character creation. So after learning about a bout the world, how the races related and interacted with each other, and a bit about the homebrew stuff, it was time to create our characters:   Step 1: Everyone pick your race and gender. Step 2: DM has 15 slips of paper folded up, each of the 5 players pick one, but aren't allowed to look at them at this time. Step 3: Everyone rolls 6 sets of 4d6, keeping the highest 3. Step 4: You can reroll 2 sets, keeping either the original or reroll, but couldn't swap the order. Step 5: Open your slip of paper. It contained a randomized list of stats that we had just determined values for (for example, the rolls may have ended up 16, 17, 14, 12, 8, 18, but the stat order might be WIS, DEX, CON, STR, INT, CHA). Step 6: Pick your character's class, skills, and background based on the the stats you now have.   The DM's rationale behind this method was basically ""realistically, you don't get to choose your stats, they're determined by the fates. You don't have high strength because you're a fighter or high intelligence because you're a wizard, you become a fighter because you have high strength, or a wizard because you have high intelligence.""   I could see a lot of people not liking this method, but the group I played with actually enjoyed it (one of the other members of the group only ever played fighter or rogue prior to this, in which he played a wizard, which became his most favorite character that he'd ever played)."

As this would likely be used by a dedicated fighter(I did make it from that viewpoint, not to discount other possible uses) the melee damage would be top class, but I think the inability to effectively cast spells might even it out. A two-weapon fighter might be able to cast a verbal spell or activate a command word for extra damage, but a three-weapon fighter would not. Might work, might not, but I like the idea. Thanks!  As for the AC, I agree that it might be good to drop the bonus, leaving it at Dual Wield, though I did clarify the bonus in OP(only +2). I would also say that it may incur some armor restrictions.  If these are Dex-based bonuses I suppose it would only be viable for light armor, as medium has a maximum Dex bonus of +2, and heavy has no Dex bonus."
dndnext,3dror1,philbilly312,2,Sun Jul 19 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"Whenever I as a DM add something that may be potentially over-powered I tell my players this is subject to change at my discretion.  That's important.  I added an ability to Dual-Wield what I classify as Pole-arms.  (Quarterstaffs, Halberds, Glaives, spears, etcs) Anything that has a pole/shaft handle.  These weapons are typically 2 handed (besides spear/quarterstaff).  So What I did was I toned the damage die down from d10 (or d8 whatever) to 1 size less, as follows:  2d6 > 1d12 > 1d10 >1d8 > 1d6 > 1d4 > 1 dmg  I also do not allow Ability Modifier on the second attack.  So you should consider that the 3rd weapon SHOULD ALWAYS have to be a light weapon as a blockage (no light weapon does more than d6 damage that I am aware of)  Or consider making it so all the damage die sized are reduced, ALSO, It should require Concentration (so you can have your concentration broken and drop the 3rd weapon, the exact same mechanic as magic users, so magic users don't run around with this).  You are also giving a hefty +1 more AC (any static increase is HUGE in 5e), to someone who already has +1 AC from dual wielder (with your feat I mean).  They are already using 3 weapons at the cost of someone who would use 2, and are now increasing their damage potential from LIGHT weapons to all 1h weapons, the extra +1 AC seems a bit overpowered, especially sense people will probably be dex based in this, so they will already get their AC to be something like:  11 (leather armor) + 5 (dex mod) + 1 (dual wielder) + 1 (tri wielder) = 18 AC, which is as good as the guy who goes great sword and plate armor.  Add in magical armor, and your looking at an AC thats up to 21 for a guy who constantly get's three attacks every turn (even at the lowest level)."
dndnext,3dror1,Servius_Maximus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this awesome feedback! This is exactly what I needed.  I didn't even think about changing the damage die. Even if I kept the weapon as a katana(longsword) for flavor, it makes more sense that it would only deal the damage of a light weapon.  I'll definitely play around with changing the damage die, but should it be for all three weapons if it requires Concentration?  Personally the way you described the AC is exactly the way I imagined it, at least for this one campaign. As in One Piece(the Inspiration) the heroes would be bad*sses like that(ie. 3-sword Guy vs. Knightly dude). For slightly more mundane or ""realistic"" worlds though I will definitely remove the extra AC.  Thanks again, this is great stuff. I also added the damage die reduction to OP, though not as a rule."
dndnext,3dror1,deathbymanga,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:37:23 2015 UTC,"Changed AC bonus so its clearer. These rules aren't necessarily for every campaign as it depends on what you are running.  The basis of what I did is mainly re-flavoring, so I don't think I just added mechanical advantages.  I looked at the TWF rules and added a third weapon. I didn't want the extra damage from this weapon to unbalance the system so I tweaked the ability bonus from the Fighting Style to make it weaker, and added a draw cost to try slowing the damage output."
dndnext,3dror1,Aghastated,2,Sun Jul 19 01:31:07 2015 UTC,"The mouth part seems kinda off, I suggest you put something in there such as the following: ''The third weapon is used by the player through an extra appendage, piece of his armor such as the legs, back etc. or have a modified weapon that is capable of delivering the third blow''. This way, it doesn't seem ridiculous.   On a side-note, I have watched a movie once where guys fight eachother with weapons. One of the warriors bound a knife to his long ponytail, effectively giving him a third weapon with which he can attack. Sounds right up this third attack's alley."

Her thinking was that the world was spinning, and circling the sun but the rod wouldn't ever move as an absolute point. So depending on the time of day and your geographical location it may just take out a mountain or blow through the center of the world like a bullet. We only found the scar of one that blew out the back of castle and tore a valley through a mountain range."
dndnext,3dnwyo,TheKnightMadder,7,Fri Jul 17 23:32:02 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure that if an immovable rod really was absolutely immovable, the moment it hit earth at a good angle the explosion would endanger life on earth.  The earth is simultaneously spinning around itself at around 460 m/s, travellign around the sun at around 30 km/s all while the solar system itself moves at something like 26000 m/s.  And altogether the entire galaxy is moving at about 1,000,000 m/s.  Just taking that last one into account, if a 1 kg rod suddenly gained 1,000,000 m/s of speed it would strike the earth with the force of 239 tons of TNT (i assume, im not actually sure how to calculate force in an object that cannot move and therefore does not actually take any recoil from force). Far below the yield of a nuke, except that it would not lose its speed and keep exploding like that all the way through the earth.   There'd be absolutely no way to know which direction it was going to go without a team of astronomers telling you all the information i just did, but better, and anyone nearby would be killed instantly.  At best the earth would find itself with a new piercing. At worst maybe something would go wrong with the atmosphere when it suddenly finds a hole clean through the magma core of our planet."
dndnext,3dnwyo,maybemakingsoup,6,Sat Jul 18 09:05:38 2015 UTC,"As literal as this is, it's terribly game breaking considering you can just move east of anything and drop the rod, totally destroying anything in its path.

If everyone is looking for traps, then no one is mapping their route (could get lost), searching for food and water (will have to use rations), watching for ambushes (traps are usually on the ground in front of you, while ambushes are usually higher and to the sides).  So ask the party of they are doing anything as they walk and see if they miss something."

dndnext,3dprqi,rollingForInitiative,8,Sat Jul 18 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"I have a two-check rule - it goes for everything. It means, in almost all cases, there'll only be two checks for one thing, unless that thing is something that will always succeed if you take enough time.  Either this enables two players to roll for the same thing (typically knowledge, insight, perception, investigation checks) or one player helps another doing one thing, thereby granting them advantage (typically on strength/dex checks, performance, medicine or similar checks). There's never three checks for the same thing (like five players rolling knowledge checks or insight checks, etc.).  By the way, when it comes to traps, I usually have them use investigation, and a low/failed check might set of the trap (as in, you didn't notice the pressure plate, oops, you stepped on it), which is why a party usually has someone specialized in investigation, who takes care of traps.  An ambush is sprung when people get close enough, so I'd either just use passive perception and have the monsters roll stealth - which eliminates your problem entirely - or give the 1-2 guys in the front perception checks, after which the surprise starts.   I would probably always let my guys find a hidden door, if they say 'we all search the room for as long as it takes, looking specifically for hidden doors' and just figure out how long I think it would take them. They never do, however, because they know that is how you get eaten by wandering monsters ;)"

And if the guy in the front rolls low then she/he would stumble into it. If the guy behind the guy in front declares they are also looking you can call it giving help to the guy in front and give that person advantage. if the guy in front bumbles into something you can use perception to determine who is surprised by the trap if it would affect more than one person."

Usually, what I'll do is encourage the person with the highest Perception or Investigate to try to find something*, and I'll allow another player to use the Help action to impose Advantage. If that fails, I usually raise the DC by quite a bit to keep the narrative going and make sure we don't get bogged down looking for one secret for forty minutes of our limited game sessions.   *Of course I don't force people to do that or railroad them.

dndnext,3dpnn5,maybemakingsoup,2,Sat Jul 18 06:18:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. I never even thought about this. I usually just explain to the player what kind of spell is being cast at them and tell them to make a save.  I'd imagine arcana checks as a reaction seems like a fair, realistic approach. I wouldn't let them check unless they were proficient in arcana, though. Although some things go without saying, like a lightning bolt or fireball.  It might also be fair that they have no idea what a spell does unless it works. This is something that might be based on rule 0. Someone else could have a better explanation from previous editions, though."
dndnext,3dpnn5,fredemu,2,Sat Jul 18 06:08:17 2015 UTC,"If it's something obvious like a big bolt of fire that shoots towards them, they may not know the spell is called ""firebolt"", but they probably get the idea.  If it's something subtle like, say, Hex or Bane, then I'd say they need to have a reason to know what casting that sort of spell would look like or what it would do, then they could make an arcana check to see if they could figure out what just happened to them.  If it's a Warlock that's very familiar with Hex, he can easily figure out that's what just happened (although he may not know specifically which of his stats was targeted). If it's a Barbarian that's not proficient in Arcana, he may be able to piece together he's under the effects of a spell, but he probably won't have any idea what the spell is doing."
dndnext,3dpnn5,rollingForInitiative,2,Sat Jul 18 08:11:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't require a reaction to do it. Imo, it doesn't take any sort of exertion to just instantly know what's happening. Do you require a reaction for them to see if they've met a person in combat before? Do you require a reaction for them to figure out that the warrior in full armor is using full plate? To you call for a reaction for someone to notice that a rogue is using a hand crossbow and not a longbow?   I would say that if it's a spell the spellcaster knows, they'd just know it if they saw the casting. If it's a spell they cannot cast themselves, I'd call for an arcana check, but not with any sort of action. Just to see if they've encountered the spell before. I might allow Religion as well, if the caster is a Cleric or Paladin."

dndnext,3dpnn5,DNDnoobie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:27:44 2015 UTC,If they can't cast it themselves or haven't encountered the spell being cast then they are unfamiliar at worst and know the school at best. If you see a Mage cast something turn 1 and they do the same spell turn 2 but it fails the second time they may know what he/she is casting depending on the circumstance.
dndnext,3dpnn5,tulsadan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:24:40 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No.  DMs I have encountered have a range of positions from ""There is no way to identify"" to ""Everyone knows"", with each falling somewhere on that spectrum.  In general, I've seen it be relevant in four situations.  Counterspell, legendary resistance, portent/lucky and disguising spellcasting.  For me, if none of these apply, I just state what the spell is.  Who cares if everyone knows the creature just cast hold person if no one can do anything about it?  If it does make a difference, I require an Arcana check for arcane spells or Religion check for divine spell.  If the spell is on someone's spell list they automatically know the spell being cast.  The other situation - trying to cast charm person or suggestion or some other manipulative spell while being observed, I allow the caster to make a Deception check against Insight."
dndnext,3dpnn5,rockmanz3r0,2,Sat Jul 18 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest arcana or religion based on the nature of the caster, or even nature for druid/Ranger spells."

dndnext,3docg7,SenorAnonymous,4,Sat Jul 18 00:47:21 2015 UTC,"Lets compare the pros and cons.  5 Fighter levels:   Pros:    One more chance to aply sneak attack that doesn't use your bonus action, frees it up for cunning action same amount of ABI in total, but you get your first 2 faster then the other option (only 2 more levels from where you are) 2 more d10 hit dice, generally nice to have    Cons:    You miss out on death strike, potential double damage for all your attacks, very nice if you want to focus heavily on assasination Your sneak attack progression and general rogue progression is delayed by 2 more levels, this will allways leave you 1d6 short of the 3 level option, but since gain the damage of another attack you come out more then even   I would say if you want to go for a more burst, take out the main target at the start of combat aproach stay with 3 fighter levels.  But since your main concern seems to be beeing more reliable throughout combat you will propably want to go with 5 fighter levels. This makes you a lot more reliable since you get twice the chances to aply your sneak attack, generally more damage since you get two attacks and you will have your cunning action available to be more mobile.  I actually just convinced myself to go with 5 levels for my own rogue/battlemaster multiclass instead of the 3 I was planning :)"
dndnext,3docg7,G3nji_17,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:57:03 2015 UTC,"Great point about freeing up the bonus action! Way less reason to dual wield and miss out on a core rogue feature when you have an extra attack.  Also, when you put it like that, 1d6 sound like a small price to pay for all this. The main price (as in every MC build I suppose) is the delay in level progression, as you said.   What order would you choose to take fighter and rogue levels? The Con save proficiency is swaying me toward starting as fighter, as well as the rogue making up for it with evasion (eventually)"
dndnext,3docg7,G3nji_17,2,Sat Jul 18 00:46:44 2015 UTC,"Starting as a fighter has the main benefit that you get heavy armour proficiency, but since you are most likely going for a dex focused character this isn't really important.  Starting rogue gives you 1 more skill that you are proficient with, which is nice.  But starting fighter you have acces to some skills that rogues can't pick, namely Animal Handling, History and Survival.  The con vs dex save choice is honestly a matter of preference, I personally like dex more then con.  The main thing is really the skills. If you want one or two of the skills that are exclusive to fighter and are ok with having 1 skill less you should choose fighter for 1st.  If you want more skills overall and/or don't care about the fighter skills go with rogue.  Going fighter 1st also gives you 2 more HP, which you can savely ignore honestly.  So really it is a matter of preference and what kind of character you had in mind :)"

dndnext,3docg7,Unwyrden,2,Sat Jul 18 12:58:11 2015 UTC,"Doing whatever you'll find most fun is the best approach. Worrying about what your character will do a level 20 is fun, but the likelihood of getting to that level makes it more theory than viable worry. We all do it though...me probably more than others.  Sneak attack only applies to 1 attack per turn, and Assassinate only works in some opening rounds (alert at least helps you get to the front of initiative but otherwise doesn't help with Assassinate) so extra damage sources are nice. Superiority dice and BM maneuvers are a versatile choice. Trip attack would serve you well I think.  Extra attack is a tough call...more attacks means more chances to hit and not miss sneak attack for the round, but extra hits won't grant you more sneak attacks. Committing 5 levels to fighter means you lose 2 ASIs/feats and 2d6 sneak attack damage...not to mention death strike, elusive, and stroke of luck.  I'd stick with Rogue personally."
dndnext,3docg7,Unwyrden,2,Sat Jul 18 01:51:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not too worried about level 20, my main concern is getting my character's first round damage (through assassinate, SA, and superiority dice) to be high enough that someone else who doesn't specialize in it can't outdo me. I want my role to matter.   The riposte maneuver is where I was hoping to generate extra sneak attack damage, not through extra attack; that's just to give me another opportunity to hit with SA while keeping me relevant past the first turn (and also to add to the surprise round nova when I do get it >:). SA damage once per turn barely competes with martial classes and their extra attacks, so I feel the dip to level 3 in fighter is worth the maneuver and action surge. I was definitely tempted to go straight rogue initially, but the assassinate ability alone just wasn't enough imo.  Oh with Alert I was referring to the first part of assassinate where advantage is granted on attacks vs enemies who haven't had a turn in combat yet, not the surprise round bit."
dndnext,3docg7,Unwyrden,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:04:35 2015 UTC,"If your group's play style will allow for a lot of surprise rounds then don't lose death strike. Its flat 2x multiplier increases all damage not just damage dice like crits, and since it's always going to trigger on a crit you're going to hit really hard when it happens.  If your group isn't sneaky, then death strike and the crit portion of assassinate are nearly useless because you'll rarely surprise anyone. In that case, maximizing your ability to sneak attack is crucial. Riposte is an excellent maneuver. Trip attack and feinting attack can both grant you advantage on an attack for sneak attacks. Lunging attack could be useful as well since it would enable you to attack without having to disengage if you need to retreat, though the mobile feat would be better still.  It seems like you've got a pretty good plan!"
dndnext,3docg7,Unwyrden,2,Sat Jul 18 12:55:38 2015 UTC,"It's such a tough call missing out on Death Strike, but I think I have to do it. Waiting until the 17th level for a great feature is certainly a worthwhile investment, but knowing I could be tearing it up with the maneuvers and extra attack from fighter as early as level 8 would make me regret the wait I think. I'm impatient!  My group is definitely sneaky, and surprise rounds are a strong possibility in some encounters. I'm hoping to improve my surprise round damage with the extra attack and maneuvers, and although at 17th level it may not make up for missing Death Strike (too lazy to calculate it out right now), I don't have to worry about my target succeeding on the Con save. The reliability is a big draw for me.   My thoughts exactly with the maneuvers! I'm planning on riposte (reason I decided to MC in the first place), trip (for the reasons you stated), and precision attack. Thanks a lot for the feedback, it's all very helpful and appreciated!"
dndnext,3docg7,Avex4,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:50:12 2015 UTC,"As an afterthought, have you considered a more even split between fighter and rogue? More maneuvers with bigger superiority dice could be more reliable on average than relying mainly in sneak attack. Pushing attack, disarming attack, and sweeping attack might fit your needs (not sure how sweeping attack would interact with sneak attack...same attack so sneak attack might hit both targets...haven't looked into it though). Dice get bigger at fighter 10, and you'd have a total of 7 maneuvers and 5 dice. Fighter 11 would give you the extra attack upgrade. That'd leave you with Rogue 9 for 5d6 sneak attack damage.  You've got some tough choices splitting between Rogue and Fighter. Pretty fun!"

Any spell whose casting time is greater than one action, one bonus action, or one reaction requires concentration while casting. This includes any spell cast as a ritual, but also spells like mending or prayer of healing. Second, readying a spell requires concentration to be maintained between your casting and your releasing of the spell. This is true even if you merely ready a cantrip like firebolt."

Intelligence would be what you remember about it (such as a wizard having read about it in a tome) or what you can figure out by observing it. For observation, I'd make it take longer so not really an in combat thing unless you want to blow some turns.  Match one skill with one stat as fits, then set a DC for how likely something is to be gleamed from it."
dndnext,3dp2wi,genteelGunslinger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:21:09 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, I say rolling anything above a 5 for relatively common creatures like trolls results in the most basic of information. Such as that they are trolls and that fire is their major weakness. 10 and above tells you WHY it's their major weakness, that is that they regenerate unless set on fire. And 15 results in learning that severing limbs is a bad idea, since they survive without limbs attached, and eventually just grow them back seconds later. And said limbs are also still animate. Essentially, for common creatures, 15 is enough to get a completely in-depth knowledge of what they're facing.  For rarer creatures, it would take a 5 to just find it's name, but a 10 to find out a single, general important fact about them, 15 for some more in depth information, and 20 tells you just about everything you need to know about them.  For something utterly alien (like a mutant creature of some crazed alchemist or something that is not found at all on the material plane unless brought there), only scholarly individuals can even hope to make the check, and generally a 15 will tell you basic information on what they know and what it is called, but only getting a 20 will reveal facts about them.  Lore books around monster lore reduces these checks by one level. So, for the troll and using the book, they will immediately learn about it being a troll and it's weakness to fire, but if it's in the heat of battle, they still need to make checks to find the right info as they rush to find it.  This rule doesn't apply to alien or extremely unusual creatures because that would be an entire book unto themselves and such a book will probably be pretty rare and difficult to find."
dndnext,3dp2wi,S-nine,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:39:24 2015 UTC,Since you are usually using low DC's I would encourage you to try using passive scores compared to 10+CR of monster as I detailed above. Saves time rolling while still letting the players feel like their skills/stats are useful.

It kind of steals the luster of the characters with those abilities if anyone can do the exact same thing with a skill check. It may seem like a trivial thing, but it's important to feel useful or unique in the party, and if someone else can suddenly do the exact same thing you spent time and effort leveling up to be able to do, it's kind of a punch in the gut. So, even if you rolled a natural 20 on a check for, say, a Blue Dragon, about the most useful information you'd recall is that they really like sapphires and tend to live in deserts, feeding on camels if they can get them. I can't justify giving away the monster's specific attacks, weaknesses or strengths based on a Skill check, though."

I only give information if they stop to ask for it, and this costs them no action in combat. Either you know or you do not.  This works well for me because none of my players have boosted and Int based skill with expertise or any other such nonsense. Even if they did I would probably keep the system to reward their investments.  Edit: Works well for high CR monsters, as these are ALWAYS things that the party has to research in some long forgotten library in order to get any information on. (EG: CR 20 = DC 10+20 = DC 30)"
dndnext,3dp2wi,jbien,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:35:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the best solution I've found is this: if the character would have knowledge of the creature (past experience, regional lore, or as a racial foe) then I allow that particular character an int check. I then parse knowledge based on how well they roll. Unless they are a bard. They get to roll for anything (because, well, bardic knowledge)."
dndnext,3dni43,Chopxsticks,15,Fri Jul 17 18:33:36 2015 UTC,"You get to choose four spells at level one but only have the means to cast them two times accumulatively. So in a fight you may choose to cast a level one spell and consume a slot and on a subsequent turn cast that same spell thus consuming your second slot. Alternatively, you could cast a different spell than what you cast the first time using up the second slot. Slots are cannons/gunpowder and spells are cannonballs."
dndnext,3dni43,drewboy111,8,Fri Jul 17 18:38:57 2015 UTC,I like analogies when explaining things. This cannonball one works well.
dndnext,3dni43,meoka2368,13,Fri Jul 17 18:50:03 2015 UTC,And remember kids. You can put a small cannonball(low level spell) into a bigger bore cannon(higher level spell slot) but you can't put a bigger cannonball(high level spell) into a smaller bore cannon(low level slot).
dndnext,3dni43,drewboy111,5,Fri Jul 17 18:57:03 2015 UTC,See? It works really well for explaining spells and slots.

dndnext,3dni43,hungryghoast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:50 2015 UTC,"And to add to this, it's very wise for a Bard of any stripe to choose Vicious Mockery as a cantrip, regardless of what else she chooses. It's simply one of the best cantrips in the entire game, IMO. Even if the Bard in question is going to be a healer for the party or something, imposing Disadvantage on a monster for its entire round plus dealing a small amount of damage on a failed saving throw is hard to beat for a cantrip."

dndnext,3dni43,Aardvark_Man,2,Sat Jul 18 09:23:37 2015 UTC,"Disadvantage is powerful. Even if it only affects the first attack of a series, that's still a better chance is having a good roll countered. And psychic damage is  not often resisted."

dndnext,3dni43,SlackBadger,3,Sat Jul 18 02:34:51 2015 UTC,In my opinion cure wounds is a waste of an action. You are better off using a bonus action heal(healing word) to get someone on their feet and then healing by another means after combat. Dissonant whispers is so good to either get someone off of you and/or setting up your allies for an opportunity attack. Anyways vicious mockery is awesome but it's cantrip and I only included first level spells.

I couldn't get to him past terrain/enemies, and he bled out the turn before I could reach him.    I mostly use cure wounds, but healing word is well worth having if you can only have one.  What I discovered what that even though it's less healing, the fact it's a bonus action and ranged makes it far more powerful."
dndnext,3dni43,Aardvark_Man,2,Sat Jul 18 09:25:31 2015 UTC,"So true. It doesn't scale so well if you try and up cast it but for a bard with limited slots, I'd rather have healing word over cure wounds. Now with a cleric or someone who is a main healer you should have both :)  As a bard, I took the inspiring leader feat plus I have song of rest and healing word for in combat. Eventually I might take something else with magical secrets."

He specifically gives up actions to allow his beast to attack, meaning he and the beast can't both be outputting damage at that same time. This is to keep his damage on-par with all the other classes, but it also means it feels like the master himself is pretty shoddy.  That's pretty much the crux of the issue. Either you have a character who's just as viable in combat as everyone else, and he has a minion who also does decent damage, which means that the whole character is more powerful than the balance of the system allows, OR the master is gimped in terms of combat effectiveness so that he is balanced, but then he doesn't, so it's not actually fixed at all.  And I have no idea how to fix any of that.

dndnext,3dpj9k,PrimeInsanity,2,Sun Jul 19 02:28:55 2015 UTC,"One potential path you might want to look in to is the Oathbreaker paladin line. Their channel divinity, which resets on a short rest, allows them to take control of an undead one less than its level. In practice, you can keep one undead permanently bound to your will.  But you will run into trouble in that you're toting around an undead, unless you manage to bind something like a ghost or poltergeist."
dndnext,3dpj9k,HazeZero,2,Sat Jul 18 05:19:12 2015 UTC,"There is a wis save to resist that ability. Though it's not all that likely, it's going to happen. You also need to find an undead to control.  The other option would be the Animate Dead spell. It creates undead from dead here humanoids, which I'm sure will be plentiful. Casting it also gives you 100% chance to retain control, and works on at minimum 4 undead (more if cast as a higher level spell). The Oath Breaker gets that spell at level 9. Other paladins do not get it. Both the wizard (any sub) and cleric (any sub) get access to it at level 5 (wizards get it free at level 6 if necromancer and if you can hold off until then to get an extra spell).  Wizards  of the necromancy school get the most powerful undead available. But then you don't have much in the way of tankiness which seems to be of concern here.  A couple of the cleric sub classes get heavy armor, and all get medium and shields. None get any bonus to their undead minions.  So it really comes down to how you want to do it.  There is, of course, the option to take fighter for one level, then wizard the rest of the way. Delays the undead for a level, but makes you though and have a horde of minions."

And if such a thing, couldn't you order your minion (while it still obeys your commands) to fail your own save, then cast the spell on it while it's under your command?  In essence, it seems to me that once you've got it, you can maintain control indefinitely, barring some strange circumstance where you use up your Channel Divinity before you can recast it on your minion."
dndnext,3dpj9k,TheBioengineer,2,Sat Jul 18 06:20:22 2015 UTC,"Even if you command it to fail, it's still only one.

The only reasons combat should be slow are if people are dickering around with other things or you as the GM are throwing a huge number of monsters.   Without knowing about your situation it sounds like you have one of a few problems.    You have to many players. You might need to cut your group down to 4-5 players if you cannot get through and entire round in a few minutes.  You are using to many enemies. Same idea.  Your players are not really looking for a combat based game. Consider playing something more role play heavy like political intrigue or switching to another less combat heavy game.

The games take too long    Honestly, sounds like your group might not actually want to play D&D. 5th is the most leaned down version by a long shot.   I think you need to step back and chat with your group about what kind of game they want to play. If they say ""lets play some RPGs"" you should ask them what they have in mind when they say that. More specifically, what do they want to get out of the experience. If they want intrigue and you want combat there is a disconnect there. If they want something fast and deadly and you want something tactical, same thing. You should also ask yourself why you started playing D&D. If it was because everyone said ""that sounds kind of fun,"" their heats just might not be in it."
dndnext,3dn4d2,Puns-Kill-Kittens,10,Fri Jul 17 18:19:27 2015 UTC,"For faster combat, the usual tips I give are as follows:  1) Make a cheat sheet for your monsters ahead of time with their vital stats (AC, HP, saves, attacks). Put them on a 3x5 index card. Have your players do the same thing for their vital stats.  2) Side initiative. Going from Alice to Bob to the group of Orcs to Charlie to the Goblins to the Goblin Shaman to Dave slows shit down. Just determine which side goes first and then when it's the players' turn, go around the table clockwise.  3) Roll your attacks and your damage at the same damn time and TELL the players what the target is. When you have a player who rolls a d20 to see if he hit (usually pausing to hunt through their character sheet to see what his modifier is), who then has to ask ""does a 15 hit?"" and when you say yes then picks up 1d8 and rolls, then hunts for another modifier, then does that entire routine three times (once for each attack), the game slows to a standstill. If the guy picks up 3d20 and 3d8 (match the colors!) and knows that he needs to hit AC 15, he can roll six dice at once and say ""hit, hit, miss for ... 5 plus 8 equals 13 damage!"" It is absurdly fast.  4) Spellcasters have a quick reference for their spells, NO EXCEPTIONS. You don't pause the damn game so you can look up what Bless does. You damn well better have the range, duration, effect, and any save written on your sheet somewhere because if you make me stop the game for 5m while you look up the spell, I'm skipping your turn."

You can also pull some tricks with initiative: either whoever goes first can designate who gets to go next, or you simply go in linear order around the table. The idea is to let the other person know that they're going next, so they'll be paying attention while they anticipate their turn.   people tend to get mixed up with spells a lot. Maybe having some sort of separate spell book would help   What you can try doing is to give people spell cards: write down the spell and a short description of what it does on an index card. Once they cast it, they flip it face down. This makes the question of ""what do I have available?"" more intuitive.  If people are REALLY not familiar with combat actions, you can do this even for normal actions: a card for attack, a card for dash, dodge, disengage, etc."

dndnext,3dn4d2,WizzardofAus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"There are a few tricks to shorten the length of combat.  One is to roll initiative once and keep the same order, the next is to roll damage dice and attack roll at the same time.  So if you are attacking with a longsword roll a D8 and a D20 at the same time.  Another trick is for players who are not up yet in the order to plan their next action beforehand.  The most important one is for players and the DM to memorize their modifiers.  These all shave time off of combat and make it run more smoothly.  Just give the players some time with the player's handbook, the rules are extremely simple but require some time to learn.  I recently read a post by another DM (if someone wouldn't  mind linking the post in a reply I would be grateful) where he shortened the time in his sessions by creating a system called ""pausing"" where players would remain in character but could say ""pause"" to say things out of character like what their character was thinking or to make rolls.  This means that there is less time spent just fooling around and more time spent focused on the game.  This last one is a bit of a pet project of mine, so bear with me if it seems a little ambitious.  The entire first session of the campaign would be backstory and character creation.  The entire party would sit with the DM at a table and they would hash out a shared back story for the party as a whole.  They would start by telling the DM what they basically wanted to do (be a spell caster, wear heavy armor, or be very skillful) and from there the DM would give them class options based on those basic outlines.  From there you choose race based on how the players want their characters to look and popular races for their class.  If they players don't want to get too involved with the background generation of their character, simply roll them a background as the DM.  The tables in the background options section of the players handbook makes rolling up a background easy.  Have the characters create familial relations, friends, and enemies after this step so you can utilize their backgrounds in your storytelling.  Now the group will explain their character to the rest of the party, sort of like an introduction.  After that step, have the players come up with a pre-adventure that brought them together as a group.  This pre-adventure will not actually be played, but you may reference it at a later time.  Bounce ideas off of them and let them brainstorm the pre-adventure together.  After this, your players will know people in the game world, they will know who their character is, and they will know their companions."

He has the entertainer background, and was part of a troupe of actors until very recently. What drove him to become an actor was a love of old elven plays, especially those dealing with the fey, after having grown up in a rather boring town the performances added something whimsical to his childhood.  He became a bookworm, learning all the old stories, and actually gaining some minor fame for his own portrayals of those characters. He kept reading these hints of something unspoken, that bound a mortal to wild natural energies. Eventually his studies become more hands-on, and he took to looking for signs of fey civilization, and ruins, as he traveled. One day, he found something big, and he was touched by something there.  That was when his ""powers"" started. He could heal, just a little here and there, and then he could start performing minor magic after he got a little stronger. He still thought of himself as an actor, not a paladin, throughout all of it.  Then came one night, after a pitched battle, the presence came back to him. While his comrades slept, he wandered into the woods, and found himself before a Fey King. He took two oaths that night: his Oath, that bound him to the power of the natural world, and ingraining a surplus of Life within him, and a second oath to the Court.  After that point, he still never really thought of himself as a ""paladin"", but he knew he was something more than an actor.  There's a line in the PHB that many paladins don't consider themselves paladins until they take their Oath. I like that. you have a couple levels to stretch your muscles and see just how you're going to play that character. The Oath can be a big or a little thing depending no how you RP it, but that is the point, you set your path in the class. Talk with your DM, figure out if they have some ideas, and think about who you'd like the oath to be sworn to, and exactly what the oath is. The Oath Tenets give you parameters for the ideals behind the oaths, it's not the verbal incantation itself.  It can be whatever you want it to be."

In regards to spellcasting:   you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.   Clerics don't take oaths, therefor Paladin magic does not come from their oaths at level 2, laying on hands similarly does not mention anything in regards to your oath as for why you can do it.

A god may contact these people and grant them knowledge of their tenets and additional powers at some point.

A Paladin is a person who has cast off all pursuits he or she considers lesser in pursuit of an ideal, often in the service of a deity, or at least a higher concept. Simply humbling one's self, abandoning the pursuit of frivolous things, and pledging one's self to the cause will grant one the lowest powers, such as Lay on Hands.

My character started as a Page at age 7, became a Squire at 14 and joined the Order of the Crown at age 21 as a Knight. For him, this was something he's known he was wanting to do for many years. He studied his Oaths and the Measure (their rules), before his knighting he spent the night in silent prayer reflecting on his vows. The following morning, the knight he squired for knighted him and he swore an oath to the God Habbakuk.   You can follow a set of rules governed by an order, a king, a priest, or even that you set. In the 5th ed PHB, the Oath of the Ancients states that you do not have to be affiliated with a religion, that these paladins are more interested in preserving the beauty that is life. If you want to swear fealty to a King, Religion/God, or Vow to become a paladin, that's awesome. If you want to set out to protect the world from evil because that's just what you do, you can even swear a vow to yourself and that should be enough for your guy to take up the sword and become a bulwark against all that goes against your views.

If it is con score and your con is 16 for example, you'd be able to drink most of the tonics without any adverse effects. If it's the con mod then you're limited to one or two effects which seems a bit more balanced.  In the witcher games you can generally only use a couple tonics if I remember it correctly."
dndnext,3dpd3e,Sarakin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:09:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm good points. I intended Con score so that throughout the work day someone might be able to use a variety of tonics, but that is definitely a worry--that someone could just drink a bunch and go nuts. I was hoping the crafting system and the fact that the tonics expire after 3 days would help limit how many the character could actually have on them at one time.   Also, with a Con score of 16, if they hit toxicity 8 they grant advantage to all enemies and move half their speed. In my mind I was hoping people would view that as a big hurdle to avoid, which would mean they'd drink 2-3 tonics per work day. If they wanted to just go full berserk they could push past that, but they'd be extremely vulnerable. MY worry with using the Con mod is that it would limit the tonic use too much. Because the half Con score means they grant combat advantage against enemies, I felt like that would be a solid deterrent to abuse--it might happen every once in a while, but I'm unsure if the benefits of dosing up on a bunch of tonics would be worth that penalty on the regular.   Do you think I should I make the penalty of toxicity reaching half Con score more severe?  Thanks for the feedback!"

Halfling's Hat seems underwhelming, it shouldn't just make the person look like a big halfling as that doesn't help in almost any situation, it could make a medium sized creature look like a halfling and a small creature look like a human.

OFC, there are constantly lawful neutral outsiders trying to take it back from you, that's the tradeoff.  Halfling's Hat was basically meant to make you fit in with larger creatures. The way it was intended was ""a halfling wearing it looks like a human version of themself, a gnome wearing it looks like an elven version of themself, and a ratlin wearing it looks like a monstrosity which would be killed on sight"". It was made by halflings for halflings and their kindred the Gnomes (who are considered to be ""weird halflings"" by halflings in my setting, as they were halflings who were transformed by the Fey lords). The Ratlin don't play well with it.  It is actually very useful in my setting, where race matters and discrimination based on race is a thing.

dndnext,3dmddf,jetersauce,2,Fri Jul 17 16:42:15 2015 UTC,"ha, interesting, I tried my hand at making a Satyr player race just yesterday. much of what I have is the same as what you have here (both of us drawing off the Monster Manual as inspiration I reckon).  Significant differences of mine from yours though: I made the Pan Pipes an optional race-tied feat ala the Svirfneblin Magic feat in the Elemental Evil player's companion. In place of that I gave the base Satyr race a significant bonus to jumping. Here's the rundown:  Satyr/Faun   Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Satyrs/Fauns mature at the same rate as humans but live a little over twice as long. Alignment. Fauns/Satyrs might not have an innate tendency against order, but many of them end up there as their an independence and revelry inclines many satyrs/fauns toward a chaotic alignment. Size. Satyrs/Fauns are about the same size and build as humans, Satyrs tend to be stouter and fauns more lithe. Your size is Medium. Goat’s Stride. Your base walking speed is 40 feet. Additionally the Satyr/Faun can add its Dexterity modifier to its jumping distance. Party Animal. The Satyr/Faun is proficient in Performance and with one wind instrument like the panpipes or flute.  Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.   Optional feat:  Satyr/Faun Pipes. You have learned the innate spellcasting ability that the Satyr/Faun people can express through wind instruments. While using a wind instrument like panpipes or a flute: You can cast Nystul’s Magic Aura on yourself at-will. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: Hold Person, Calm Emotions (effective on Beasts as well as Humanoids) and Charm Person. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest. To an uninitiated outside observer it would appear you are simply playing music."

dndnext,3dm7ge,genteelGunslinger,15,Fri Jul 17 12:06:29 2015 UTC,"Instead of making it inflict wounds 1st lvl at-will, that also ""recoils"" for partial damage to the caster, why not make it chargeable by using hit dice? Something like this:   The player gains the supernatural ability to inflict wounds, as per the spell. However, instead of expending a spell slot to cast it, the user expends a number of hit die equal to the slot level they wish to cast it at. The user cannot expend more than 1/2 their ECL in hit-die for a single casting in this way. (ie: at ECL 2, they could spend 1 hit die to cast inflict wounds at 1st lvl. At ECL 18, they could spend up to 9 hit dice to cast it at 9th lvl. At ECL 18, they could also spend any lesser amount of hit dice to cast it at a lower spell lvl.)   Now you have a simple, lower-level spell (inflict wounds), and you have it tied to a resource that any class will have access to (hit dice), which also pairs nicely with using Constitution as the casting ability (by keeping spell casting aspects tied to the character's ""stamina"", in a sense). The reasoning behind the 1/2 ECL requirement is to keep the ability to cast a 9th lvl inflict wounds spell roughly on par with normal spell casters. Without this restriction, an ECL 9 character could spend all of their hit dice for the day to cast the equivalent of a 9th lvl spell - far too powerful for that low of a character level.  Now in your original post, you also mention the desire for some kind of backlash/recoil effect, since the idea is the PC is using their life-force to charge the spell. How about something like this:   Should the caster use this ability and fail to kill the target with it, they gain a single failed death saving throw. This failed death saving throw does not refresh until after a long rest.   This way, instead of dealing themselves damage based on a die roll they have to carefully balance how many hit dice they use to power the ability, and how certain they are that using all of their remaining hit dice will actually kill their target. A failed death saving throw also seems like a stronger link to the PC's ""life force"" to me, like they already have one foot in the grave, so to speak. It will certainly act as a much stronger deterrent to over-using this ability, since the PC's would likely not risk invoking such a heavy penalty too often.  Finally, you also mentioned above that you want some kind of martyr effect. Should the character die while using this ability, their allies receive some kind of boon. Personally, I think just keeping it to a decent damage-dealing spell that drains the user's life-force is significantly simpler to balance, but here's my attempt at the consolation prize portion:    Should the user of this ability die while the failed death save from hit dice drain be in effect, their body crumbles to dust and fades away into the wind. Any allies within 30ft of the user at the time of death receives a Temp HP boon equal to the number of max hit dice the dead character had. These Temp HP last until the next long rest, or until new Temp HP is gained. These Temp HP do not stack with Temp HP from other sources. (ie: if the character had a Max HD of 13, then each ally within 30ft would receive 13 Temp HP).   Again, not too sure how to balance that in line with everything else. Personally, I think you should keep it as simple as possible, and limit the casting to based on expending hit dice, and over-use of the ability leading to a failed death saving throw. Also, from a flavor standpoint, I don't understand why the god of sacrifice, secrecy, and loss would grant an ability that gives any benefit to other people. The idea of sacrifice and loss is represented in the using of your own life force to charge the granted ability. But it is your campaign, so to each their own.  TL;DR:  Make the ability something like this instead:   The player gains the supernatural ability to inflict wounds, as per the spell. However, instead of expending a spell slot to cast it, the user expends a number of hit die equal to the slot level they wish to cast it at. The user cannot expend more than 1/2 their ECL in hit-die for a single casting in this way. (ie: at ECL 2, they could spend 1 hit die to cast inflict wounds at 1st lvl. At ECL 18, they could spend up to 9 hit dice to cast it at 9th lvl. At ECL 18, they could also spend any lesser amount of hit dice to cast it at a lower spell lvl.) Should the caster use this ability and fail to kill the target with it, they gain a single failed death saving throw. This failed death saving throw does not refresh until after a long rest.   EDIT: Deleted the martyr ability from the ""TL;DR"" to clean up the final ability."

Also, good point on the god thing...I really hadn't considered that...

dndnext,3dm7ge,Xindlepete,2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:43 2015 UTC,"It was certainly a neat idea, and I had been brainstorming with a friend on a Constitution based caster class for awhile. I pretty much just ported my math/reasoning from that over to this. Hit dice make a very reasonable scale for these types of things. Good luck, and I hope it works at your table the way you want it too!  P.S. - Really glad you dropped the martyr thing, too. It just makes the whole thing seem a bit too bulky to me. Cheers!"
dndnext,3dm7ge,ventus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"I might actually crop out secrecy from this gods aspect list as well. I haven't introduced this god to the players yet, so it's like that part never existed! (My setting is WIP as they play it, and since they are kinda foreigners to the campaign setting and the setting itself is littered with minor gods that change based on locale, it works out. ;P)  I was somewhat inspired with the matyr effect by the healing monks from Pathfinder, if you're aware of the archetype, but if it's less clunky as a result, it's probably for the best.  I would think a Constitution based caster would be really quite difficult to balance. I hope you have luck in working out how to do it!"
dndnext,3dm7ge,Strill,4,Fri Jul 17 14:23:37 2015 UTC,"I think the trick here is striking a balance where players see this ability/power as worthwhile, and making sure it doesn't break your game. There are a few issues that stand in the way of this.   The big one is scaling. At level 4/5 a 1st-level inflict wounds that also comes with a drawback isn't going to look super appealing. Past those levels its going to look like an even worse option, and even if a PC wanted to sacrifice themselves would they really be able to deal enough damage?  You also need to weigh just how much of a hit you want this to be. If this is supposed to inflict heavy damage, it should come with a pretty hefty penalty.  You'd probably need to tinker with it, but this is a rough and simple concept I'd consider that fits the flavor:  Death's Embrace. You have learned how to channel your own life force into a lethal attack. As an action you may use this feature to cast inflict wounds at its lowest level without material components, using your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier as your spell attack modifier. If the attack hits you may also spend any number of your available hit dice to roll and add their damage to the spell's. You take half the total damage that your target does, rounded up.  If this damage would reduce you to 0 hit points or less, or if you spend your last hit die using this feature, you die instantly. Your body explodes in a wave of pure life force, and friendly creatures in a 20-foot radius from you regain hit points equal to the damage you took."

dndnext,3dm7ge,Strill,4,Fri Jul 17 14:53:50 2015 UTC,So basically you are allowing them to use a 1st-level spell as a cantrip with the negative cost being 1/4th or 1/2th damage dealt to themselves which can't be regained until their next long rest?  I kind of like this idea. There is a lot of strategic possibilities with this set up. But if you do decide to give it to them at first level it could easily kill them right then.   A 1st level character with HP of 8 who uses this ability and rolls a damage of 24-30 on a 3d10 is dead. So the character would have to really think about when to use it.
dndnext,3dm7ge,Strill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:36:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's exactly why I thought if they do get it at level 1, that there is some story build up before the power actually comes into effect, and they gain the at will power at some later level. My party actually consists of a lot of caster/utility characters and not a whole lot of beefy martials, so they'll have to play strategically to overcome most of their obstacles. That said, almost all but one character is also a d8. And the d10 is a Archer Ranger. So no, they certainly wouldn't have the health to use it at first. Not even sure a barbarian would."
dndnext,3dm7ge,Strill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:58:58 2015 UTC,"I would try and keep things simple- don't have them trying to do division at the table.  The relevance, and therefore balance, of this power is determined by the level of the characters. same with the damage dealt by the spell. I would set the damage (dealt to the player) at twice the characters level, but also scale up the power as they gain levels- roughly +1 casting level at 5,9,13.  The second part of the power, the sacrifice, needs to be taken in the context of levels as well- this scales automatically, and tbh I think it's too strong. There is no good reason that this power should be more powerful in the hands of a barbarian rather than a cleric for example, so I would suggest removing the link to maximum health pool, and replace it with something along the lines of level times Con (if you want to retain the link to their life force) temporary HP or healing, don't complicate it by giving them healing up to a point and then temporary HP.  Lastly, I would not require the players to keep track of the damage taken specifically with this power, I would simply say if the damage causes them to drop to 0 HP, they die instantly instead of starting to make death saving throws. Alternatively, you could have them pulse a lesser amount of healing energy(doing actual healing since we then have stacking issues) for each voluntarily failed death saving throw. Probably more dramatic that way."
dndnext,3dm7ge,Strill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"Is this a little too strong?   You don't need to ask us.  Just compare it to the damage that players can already do.   Inflict Wounds: 3d10 = 16.5 average  Firebolt: 2d10 =11 average  Firebolt (Dragon Sorcerer): 2d10 + 3 = 14 average  Fighter w/ Greatsword: 4d6 + 6 (Reroll 1s & 2s) = 22.7 average  Fighter w/ Greatsword & Greatweapon Master Bonus Attack: 6d6 + 9 (reroll 1s & 2s) = 34 average  So if you're a caster, it's only barely better than a cantrip, but hurts you, and if you're a martial character, it sucks hard and isn't worth casting at all.  I'd say it needs a significant buff."

I never said the drawback was a problem, I said that it doesn't even do enough damage in the first place to be competitive, nevertheless merit a drawback.  Personally though, I don't like using the Exhaustion system as a cost. It gets absolutely crippling really quick, to the point where you pretty much take yourself out of the fight in short order, so there's rarely ever a reason to use something that would exhaust you."
dndnext,3dm7ge,Xindlepete,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:58:41 2015 UTC,"Well, increasing the damage (that is, increasing the level the spell is cast) would be increasing the self damage, so that's not exactly an option unless I just don't tie it to Inflict Wounds at all. (Which is an option and would require a bit more work that I'll probably consider)  However, if there was another drawback instead of self damage, I could actually increase the damage by making it cast at a higher level, if need be.   If worse comes to worse, there is always the option of just making it work between long rests or consume some other resource. Hit dice maybe, with every two hit dice spent past the first increasing the level the spell is cast. Hit dice are a lot harder to get back between long rests than most other resources, and very valuable. The emphasis here is the cost of sacrificing something to gain something significant, but I would also hate to give out a dud ability."

So thats 3/4 veggie-monsters, and some Bandits in the mix. The word ""Cult"" means ""bad guy"" to 95% of players so you're already getting the hang of it.   Here's an idea, hopefully you'll think of something better: Bandits are in the employ of a Druid-Gone-Bad. Druid is preparing a ritual to ensconce his malevolent will into the plant life in ""central area"". Bandits are just thugs for hire, but little do they know, the Druid's fungus monsters have infected some of them with mind spores giving him more tight control over their behavior, all the while convincing them that it makes them 'better'.   As a bonus, Druid-Gone-Bad's old mentor is interested in seeing him stopped; enough to reward the player characters with some nature loot."

Druid is empowering local wildlife to defend the myconids with extreme vigor against those not a part of the cult, identified by the presence of a specific myconid spore.  Bandits are cultists attempting to drive hunters and loggers away from relevant forest name, at the very least until enough twig blights and shambling mounds are animated to assist the myconids in defending their homes."

dndnext,3di1i2,chillyfab,121,Thu Jul 16 13:07:12 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of high CR monsters that get a bunch of fun abilities and I enjoy throwing them against my players.  However, so far my hands down favorite encounter I've run starred the lowly Lizardfolk Shaman.  The party was investigating a ruined temple out in a swamp.  The main chamber of the temple was a 40 by 80 room that had been overrun by the local flora.  In particular there was a 20 ft wide swath of trees and vines that started about 20 past the entrance.  At the far end of the room, 20 ft past foliage and 20 ft from the back wall, were two regular Lizardfolk and a Shaman (not to mention the 2-4 other lizardfolk in the small camp that would eventually hear the noise and enter behind the party).  After noticing the party the two lizardy bruisers charge forward at them getting 10 ft into the plants.  Here's where the fun starts.  The Shaman casts Plant Growth.  No concentration, turns an area covered by plants into what I affectionately call ""excessively difficult terrain"" (1/4 movement speed) and I ruled it gave everything in or behind it 3/4 cover.  Then the bruisers hide.  My party had their three melee characters slog through the plants, which now have hidden Lizardfolk waiting to ambush them, while the Ranger and Wizard hung back.  As soon as they had gotten into the plants, BAM! Spike growth.  Now if they want to move further it's 1d4 dmg per square, there are Bruisers waiting for them and it just so happens that 2 other Lizardfolk have walked in behind them to harass the ranged element.  Then to top it all off, the Shaman starts laying into the melee characters with a Thorn Whip, dragging them 10 feet for an additional 2d4 spike damage on top of the normal spell damage. (You could get really evil with a second shaman walking in the back, then playing reverse ping-pong with the characters across the spikes).  For additional fun, summon some reptiles to throw into the fray.  God damn, do I love the smell of Lizardfolk in the morning."

dndnext,3di1i2,WalrusTuskk,35,Thu Jul 16 19:05:27 2015 UTC,"I find spellcasting monsters are interesting.  The designers gave them specific spells for a reason, and I like to puzzle how they intended them to be used as well as the optimal order of using them.    For example, the acolytes from HotDQ have Bless, Cure Wounds, Sanctuary, and Sacred Flame with three level 1 spell slots.  I figure bless is so good that i'd rather have a sanctuary-protected acolyte with bless active on some kobolds with pack tactics than be spamming 1d8 sacred flames.  But, do you bless first turn?  There are obvious reasons to do so, but then the acolyte becomes a huge target (my players only seem to remember how dangerous they are once blessed kobolds are attacking them).  So, if there are enough kobolds to survive a few rounds, I started doing dodge action & sanctuary on first turn and then bless on second turn, followed by a cure wounds or dodge action.  Bless and pack tactics together were just that good.  And there are much more interesting spell casters out there."
dndnext,3di1i2,woundedKnight,16,Thu Jul 16 13:54:48 2015 UTC,"Never even crossed my mind to use sanctuary as anything but a way to get a hurt character out of the fight, you just blew my mind."

dndnext,3di1i2,BoboTheTalkingClown,2,Thu Jul 16 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize it either until I noticed that Sanctuary does not require concentration.  Here's another fun combo ... imagine a Paladin shrouded in Sanctuary, standing adjacent to his party.  He casts compelled duel on the big bad.  Now if you attack him, around half of the attacks are going to have to be reassigned to targets at disadvantage.  If damage does get through he can heal it on his action, and otherwise he can take a dodge action so attacks against him have disadvantage too.  A similar but weaker effect that only uses 1 spell slot can be achieved if the Paladin has the protection fighting style and the other PCs stay close by.  To be honest, I think just dishing out damage and kill the monster faster might be more effective.  But not nearly as fun!"
dndnext,3di1i2,woundedKnight,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think just dishing out damage and kill the monster faster might be more effective.   The monster will fall faster, but your party will likely eat more damage in the meantime. If there's a chance that they won't be able to rest after the fight, it's definitely worth considering the extra time spent taking things slow but safe."
dndnext,3di1i2,camelCasing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:12:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that careful play can be very powerful.  In my specific example, however, the Paladin still used up 2 spell slots and the effect can be ruined with a bad concentration check, whereas spending those slots on smites is rarely bad."

The fighter fires an arrow from his bow...as it approaches the armor the arrow slows and hangs in the air. The PCs start freaking out thinking this apparent ghost has telekenetic powers. The fighter charges it, and stops in his tracks and is paralyzed. That's when one of them spots that it's a gelatinous cube.

dndnext,3dmdt1,Spawndaemon,7,Fri Jul 17 13:16:20 2015 UTC,"This is a quite common strategy. For the record, though, you can't twin Eldritch Blast after level 5; if it is capable of targeting more than one target, it can't be twinned. It can be quickened, though, so you can still do two in one turn. It'll just cost you your bonus action."
dndnext,3dmdt1,moonshadowkati,3,Fri Jul 17 13:19:32 2015 UTC,"It should also be noted that if you cast any spell as a bonus action, the only other spells you cast on that turn have to be cantrips."
dndnext,3dmdt1,meoka2368,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"This is why Eldritch Blast should scale on Warlock Level, not Character level. Too good of a cantrip. I know it's amazing because Warlocks are meant to spam it when their limited slots are down and still have competitive damage, but I absolutely hate how other classes can take it and have it scale.  It is flat out superior to every other damaging cantrip in the game. Great range, Force damage, splits into multiple beams for multiple potential attacks, amazing utility with 2 levels of Warlock."
dndnext,3dmdt1,Level9Zubat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:59 2015 UTC,"True, it's really great overall.   It's not really the best at anything it does, though, aside from being the only at-will Force damage I can think of.   It isn't the most accurate; cantrips that force saving throws tend to hit more often.  It isn't the most damaging; poison spray has that beat. Edit: Actually, nvm, it wins due to Agonizing Blast.  It doesn't match up to the damage of Crossbow Experts, Great Weapon Masters, or Sharpshooters until high levels, sometimes not even then.  It can't match the far distance of a longbow.   Can't trigger Sneak Attack.  Charisma has some good benefits overall and synergizes with some classes, but does not have all of the other combat benefits of high Dexterity or Strength.   You need to delay your other class progression for 2 levels to pick it up in its best form, and you may not get much else for your trouble depending on what your build is.  Requires Verbal and Somatic components, so it can't be cast with certain weapon configurations unless you take a feat, and is vulnerable to Silence-like effects.  Only targets a creature, so a hard-ass DM may not allow you to use it to break down walls and such."
dndnext,3dmdt1,moonshadowkati,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:11 2015 UTC,"Lots of things are resistant to poison damage though, Force damage pretty much never gets resisted. Might not match CBE, GWM or SS but that can be said about all cantrips (unless you get the CHA scaling, which is superior to the Dragon Sorc level 6 since that only applies to the first application of the element, while Agonizing Blast applies to every hit of EB).  You can cast spells with a two handed weapon or sword and board that have Somatic components without the feat, as you can hold the weapon in one hand temporarily while you gesture (phb 147, two handed only applies when you attack, not when you simply hold it), or use the shield hand to make gestures.  True you need to delay class progression to get the full power of EB(Repelling Blast, Agonizing Blast or Eldritch Spear), though some Sorcerers do this for the CHA scaling damage and free Sorcery Points on a short rest (by consuming the Warlock Slots).   I just really don't like that EB scales off total level and not Warlock level, as the ability is coming from your Otherwordly Patron. Being able to get the spell through a Feat and having it power up without a Patron to empower it just...bothers me."
dndnext,3dmdt1,Level9Zubat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, it really is great overall. I agree with you too. Just pointing out some of the weaknesses here, because it isn't really a game breaker.  Yes, the damage is good, but it isn't the best that you can pump out every turn without expending resources. That's worth noting.  No, you can't do somatic gestures with the shield hand. That only works if it is a shield holy symbol and the spell has both material and somatic components. Two handed weapons are fine.  Sorcerers are still delaying spells like Fireball for it."
dndnext,3dmdt1,moonshadowkati,-11,Mon Jul 20 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"okay well that is all fine and dandy, but just because you say that you cannot twin it does not make that true. By the wording it does not say a spell that has the possibility it just says a spell that targets, so it is one spell and you can make it target only one person. Do you have any specific links or anything to say otherwise? It's definitely a DM discretion thing but that is where my question lies. The wording could go either way, and the quickened spell is pretty close in dmg to my strategy anyway."

I don't think I am even gonna try to get away with it. whether my DM's allow it or not it just seems broken... either way though, quickening EB every other round is still 10 EB in 3 rounds all on one target. Which would be 200 potential dmg and can be repeated all the way through most combats. It is still really strong."
dndnext,3dmdt1,pofzikav,4,Fri Jul 17 15:08:26 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you think you can quicken spells all day, sorcs have a very limited pool of sorcery points and quicken costs you two of those points each time you use it."

So of course not doable every round but even then, at level 6 a Paladin could do about 8d6+8 with their divine smites with slots left over for other fun spells for 16-48 damage per round (48-144 for three rounds as you had in your example). As Paladins have 6 spell slots to use for divine smite and Sorcerers have 3 points to use for twinned spell, it seems like they could both only do this for 3 rounds"

That way you keep things in line with bounded accuracy while still seeing a similar effect on capacity. But that ship has sailed.  That being said, expertise on its own usually isn't that bad. In general advantage will have a greater effect on the outcome of a die roll. Since most players rarely get up to 13th level, expertise will usually be no higher than a +4 bonus to your skills. It hardly seems game ruining for a fighter or cleric to have +4 to two skill checks. Especially compared to what spellcaster can do in general those levels."
dndnext,3dmwqn,Ashkelon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:39:32 2015 UTC,"Spellcasting and maneuvers are extremely core to the relevant classes, though, and they scale. Expertise is nice and important, but not on the same level as, say, sneak attack.  might be better as one Expertise, two new skill proficiencies?"
dndnext,3dmwqn,ademonicspoon,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:59 2015 UTC,I don't believe that the maneuver from martial adept would scale unless you were a BM.   I would agree that the martial adept feat is a shell if the actual subclass feature. That's why so few folks choose it. I have a feeling that many folks would choose this homebrew feat. I'd go one skill prof and one expertise and warn the PCs that if they try to munchkin a grappler that their shiny homebrew feat will disappear.
dndnext,3dm78e,Thahat,9,Fri Jul 17 12:03:33 2015 UTC,"The only problem I see off hand is with Riposte Strike. Giving Rogues a class feature that regularly grants reaction attacks doubles your damage output (Sneak Attack works on a riposte, even if you already used it on your turn).  I'm not saying it shouldn't be allowed, but I'd keep an eye on it; my suspicion is that a Battlemaster Rogue would actually be far better than the three existing archetypes."

dndnext,3dm78e,Puns-Kill-Kittens,3,Fri Jul 17 13:45:44 2015 UTC,"Different classes get their power progression from different features of their class. For spell casters, it's spellslots. For rogues, it's sneak attack dice. Fighters mostly get their power from their extra ASI/feats plus their extra attacks. However, I think that the battlemaster subclass is much more important to the fighter than any of the subclasses are to the rogue. The juicy parts of a rogue is the sneak attack and the main features like uncanny dodge. BM gets a lot of extra damage and accuracy from the maneuvers, which could be even more potent for the rogue. Riposte has already been mentioned, but Trip attack and Precision attack would also be very very strong.   I would expect this to be too strong and outshine the existing rogue subclasses. If you want the power and utility of the BM, I think you should have to MC and hurt your sneak attack progression as a trade off. There are lots of reasons why MCing into BM is strong for a rogue; armor and shield prof, fighting style, second wind, and the all powerful action surge you can use during your surprise assassinate round. Plus auto crits from assassin will also double your superiority dice damage. For your consideration."

(the plan for the build was go knife/hand bow +crossbow expert feat), sometimes drop either the knife or the x-bow for the grapple/unarmed stuff, for which you need nothing from fighter  and expecially when you take the monk levels into acount (so no wearing armour) there is little to be gained from fighter but a higher hitdie, a fighting style that wont fit thematically, and at level 3 the manouvers."
dndnext,3dm78e,winkingchef,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:32:19 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I wasn't sure what out of the rogue class you were looking for so I thought I'd throw it out there.  I'd generally agree with what else has been said that you can probably take the battlemaster archetype as a rogue and it won't be unbalanced, but I'd need to run through each maneuver to be 100% sure. Trip seems like the most useful to gain advantage, but its really not difficult to flank an enemy as a rogue so I don't think advantage is as big a deal as it could be."

dndnext,3dm78e,WizzardofAus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:11:40 2015 UTC,"personally i quite like the martial adept feat...but the downside is only one mastery die. if only it were at least two it would have worked but 1 is so SO limited compared to all other feats (that can be used nearly all the damn time)  @the stacking of dice, the same can be done by a fighter by simply making more attacks, you would add your superiority die's to that aswell, and that can be done nearly all the time, instead of only on knocked-down enemies (limited by ki-points in practice) or those you sneak up upon. so i dont know really, would it be unbalanced?"
dndnext,3dm78e,RethinkJeff,6,Fri Jul 17 13:36:12 2015 UTC,"IMO house ruling Martial Adept to 2 dice is more balanced than swapping out the subclasses.  This would cap the scaling effect.  Otherwise, I'd worry about the sneak attack scaling stacking with BM dice."

Dual Wielder feat (as you mentioned) Hiring, summoning, or animating ""weapon caddies"" to use their action/object interaction solely to hand you more weapons. Special mention for being absurd: get an octopus familiar, they have 8 arms and thus can hold 8 weapons, handing you 2 per turn until it runs out."

As for Wisdom with another mental stat as secondary (this applies to Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Warlock, and Wizard), it's not really a nerf, because they still save well against everything they saved well against before. Still, I could see the argument for giving Paladin and maybe Druid the Strength save proficiency."

dndnext,3dnf0k,SoManyFives,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:57:07 2015 UTC,"There are a few main issues. First, with intelligence: most DM's won't let you solve the puzzle room with a die roll, or even several die rolls; you can't do some intelligence based tasks if you, the player, aren't smart enough to do so. LOW intelligence characters can be even worse, if you have the sort of DM who says Regar, your INT is 6. You aren't smart enough to come up with the advanced tactics you're trying to use. Do something else.  Charisma has similar problems. This may not be true for all tables, but most tables I've been at ask the bard to actually say something when he tries to persuade or bluff, or even sing something when he wants to perform. That is unfair, especially if the DM then applies penalties or bonuses based on the speech. One solution is to just allow die rolls for everything, but that could be a somewhat boring game, with very little actual interaction or problem solving. How far do we take it? ""I come up with a brilliant strategem that will allow us to easily defeat these stupid goblins. I got a 17 on my INT check."" I chose to go the other way, completely divorcing the social and mental abilities of the characters from the die rolls."
dndnext,3dnf0k,Strill,2,Fri Jul 17 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"Instead of getting rid of the mental scores, just replace them with physical descriptions.  Intelligence would be ""beard length"", wisdom could be forehead wrinkles, and charisma could be ""bed room eyes"".  The just change up the skills a little to match.  This gets around your main problem, which just seems to be that mental scores in principle don't make sense, but doesn't completely break the game by carving the number of scores down from 6 to 3.

Th system is predicated on the belief that mental ability scores suck. Whether or not that is actually the case is beyond the scope of my original post; I was more concerned with whether or not I could, not whether I should.  That being said, Most GM's don't completely divorce charisma checks from a player's ability. How many DM's don't respond to ""I try to persuade King Oswald to send military support to Blackdale to fight off the invading orcs,"" with ""OK, what do you tell him?"" instead of ""OK, what did you roll on your diplomacy check?"" In my experience, most DM's ask the former question, and will further apply a bonus or penalty to the eventual check based on their judgement of the quality of the speech.  It's even worse with intelligence. How many DM's will let you roll an intelligence check to solve the puzzle room of the dungeon? Shouldn't your wizard with 20 INT have no problem solving a logic puzzle? Why isn't ""My character is smart enough to do this"" a good enough answer here?   You realize that Insight is entirely roleplay right? You pass the check and you notice that someone is making a tell.   In my experience in 5E, I've never seen insight used as anything but the roll opposed to bluff, or as the ""hint roll"". Under this system no-one will be rolling bluff, so insight gets kicked as well. You shouldn't have to have this exchange in game:  Player: ""That sounded off. Do I think he's lying?""

dndnext,3dlvg1,jaygon4146,5,Fri Jul 17 09:20:08 2015 UTC,"I like it, but I would say I personally probably never use it.   This is mostly because as I've DM'd I've slowly fallen out of love with very mechanic heavy ways to simulate the world. These days my pursuits are coming up with very streamlined approaches to deal with big things like factions and nations.  I would say off the bat that they don't 'feel' like 5e mechanics. Using just numbers to represent spying and how to destroy factions brings up an easy way to miss the small story telling these events can cause. Since 5e has pushed Role playing to the forefront I would personally say that these rules don't fit into that theme.  That's not to say that it's bad, there's been plenty of times when I've wanted to run mechanically driven 'strategy' games with a roleplaying context. But from experience I would say it doesn't suit D&D unless your players already like the way that this sort of mechanic would play out."

I hope I don't sound like I'm disregarding your comment or being to critical, I do value your input. I like discussing these kinds of things."
dndnext,3dlvg1,Akuma_Reiten,2,Sun Jul 19 05:32:16 2015 UTC,"Sure. Alot of my feelings about mechanic heavy systems comes from things like 3.5 and Pathfinder. I really enjoyed them for a long time and even learned the rules and build options by heart, but after I started playing 5th edition I realized there was too much juggling in those systems. Fights and many dice rolls would get bogged down with everyone trying to work out what their bonuses were etc.  The reason I find 5e roleplay focused has alot to do with it's emphasis on asking players who there character is, rather then what they can do. I've found going through the background system makes a big difference (Especially in new players) in how some players push their RP ability. Since combat no longer relies on big number bonuses often a good tactic is to RP the fight in a way that would grant you advantage, so players are pushed to really take control of the environment around them.  Now I've actually written multiple add-on rules in the past to deal with big concepts (For a long time I tried to work out a mechanical political system), and what I've often found is players are either largely not interested or they get bogged down and confused by the rules. The further the rules are away from the base concepts of the core rules the less they work I've found.  This is why I really like some very simple systems people make on here, based on giving towns, villages etc ability scores as if they were a character. But the scores represent other things about the town (Like say, Dex for spying ability). I like that as it's a very easy way to translate to most players how it works.  Now on your faction rule-set there is actually a primary weakness. If you have a player faction, what is everyone doing? In a game I'm running at the moment the players are ruling a Kingdom, so what I try to do is present them with big problems to discuss and solve. Many of them also like to do things on their own (There all in charge of something different), but one of them has gone off and really focused on their area- but with everything else going on I haven't had time to go through alot with them.  So my question is, in your faction system is there a way for each player individually interact with it? Since it can only perform one action between bits it feels like the players have to discuss over it every time, but players often like to each pour their own unique influence into these things."
dndnext,3dlvg1,Akuma_Reiten,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:17:32 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean about making combat simpler with less math involved. This would be purely a DM thing, the players wouldn't ever make a turn. That might be a thing I need to improve, communicating the player relation here.  Initially the party wouldn't be a faction at all. They would see the factions in the world and the results of their actions, and they might get a mission to destroy an enemy ship or something like that, but they would never interact with it on a mechanical level. Even when the party grow to be considered a faction, they would make decisions during play that the DM would translate to the Faction Turn later.  So to answer your question. Is there a way for each player to individually interact with it? Kind of. The party would come to an agreement about what the goal of their faction turn is and what their assets might do. If each member has such separate areas of significant command, they could be treated as sub factions with individual smaller turns (though they would need a lot of resources to make that happen).  During play, the players could do whatever they like. If they want to tag along with their own ship asset to take out the enemy they can do that, and their actions could directly influence the faction turn.  Did that clarify the player interaction a bit? I think if used well, a system like this would help create a dynamic ever changing world. It may be a bit mechanically complex on the surface but I don't believe it will be to over whelming a couple of turns in. I'm still play testing it myself so I look forward to seeing how it affects the world, and how I can alter the system to make it better or more dynamic."

The spine itself is likely thicker than the kid's entire head, let alone the surrounding flesh and muscle on top.

The reason I prefer Dex > Str is just the way I like to go about doing things outside of combat. Rather then be strength and muscle my way to get what I want, I want to be shadowy and sneaky to do that. The rest of the points in warlock are so I can use charisma, controlling spells, and hex, in combat. I will be going ""Great old one w/ Blade Pact."" I understand I am already going over the norm with using Dex > Str, which makes this choice even more hard. But I have ultimately decided to go with RP > Stats and stick to my dragon born.

dndnext,3dljtp,rockmanz3r0,2,Fri Jul 17 16:24:36 2015 UTC,"I've never built a bladelock before, but looking over the PHB, I'd go a different route personally. I'd not wear any armor, I'd go for the Fiend as my patron so I could have Dark One's Blessing (free temp HP for killing things), Pact of the Blade, and take Armor of Shadows and Fiendish Vigor for an Invocations at Warlock level 2.   Armor of Shadows lets you cast Mage Armor at will on a willing target (yourself) and it makes the targets AC 13 + Dex Mod (no limit) while they aren't wearing armor (doesn't mention shields so I assume they still add on. Assuming you use a shield you'd have 17 or 18 AC depending on your Dex bonus with the option to go higher as you raise your Dex more.   Fiendish Vigor lets you cast False Life at will on yourself and it gives you 1d4+4 temp HP.   If you still insist on taking 1 level of Fighter I'd probably take the Dueling fighting style instead for an extra 2 damage on your pact weapon's attacks.   Just from my view that would make you tougher to kill and deal more damage, but as I said I've never built a bladelock before."

Not so much optimization, but can you play the character as someone who isn't human? Is your character a non-human? Will the character change at all if that was changed? Is it just a mix up of a class and a race? So many times I've seen Drow with a character matching the player, in worlds were all Drow are forced to be retarded evil by the literal threat of Demonic possession.

dndnext,3dljtp,Strill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:27 2015 UTC,"I disagree... if you choose a race purely for the bonuses then potentially, there can be less of a spark in the character.  Our player picked a male Dragonborn character because she liked the whole aura about them, she wanted to be a big scary, scaly, acid breathing badass, with fierce clan loyalties - and she roleplays that very well.    Much of the fun in our game comes from the interplay between us players, and the way the DM feeds from that interaction.  My Necromancer obsesses over personal grievances, and can be blunt and bitter.  A rogue member of the Dragonborn's clan attempted to assassinate me, leading to angry (in character) exchanges between us - I was determined to deal with the miscreant, but the Dragonborn would not let me as he saw the rogue clan member as his responsibility alone.  That inspired a plot hook which covered several recent gaming sessions, and which was extremely good fun to roleplay for everyone.  (the assassin turned out to be a Doppleganger impersonating a Dragonborn, hired by the BBEG to sow discord amongst us)  Would we have got that if she had picked a mechanically more optimised half-elf?  I doubt it.  The same goes for me picking a human Necromancer instead of a Gnome - lower spell DC - but a Gnome just did not fit the image of the character I wanted to play!!"

We are not a group who care even one iota for optimisation, along with my Human Necro and the Dragonborn Sorceror, we've got a vegetarian Halfling Ranger who rides a war-pig into battle, and an utterly stupid Human Paladin who has foregone all of his class healing powers in order to be able to cast lots of light spells at will!  There's no healing in the party, no stealth - optimisers would have a fit!

dndnext,3dljtp,t0beyeus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"Yes it is better and could maybe be considered the ""best"" option but it isn't like a Dragonborn is bad or at a huge disadvantage. No race really is.  I honestly can't find a use for all of the Invocations. Thirsting Blade, Lifedrinker, Agonizing Blast, Devil's Sight and Beguiling Influence. That leaves 3 more. Mostly all free spells to use as utility options. That is a lot of options. Even a Half Elf would take Beguiling Influence so that they could free up their skills for a total of 8. That means the net gain of a Half Elf vs a Dragonborn is 1 freed up invocation and 2 extra skills. Not exactly gamebreaking or vastly better. Especially when you consider a Dragonborn with Devil's Sight has double the Darkvision range and can see in magical darkness."
dndnext,3dljtp,Strill,-5,Fri Jul 17 15:04:44 2015 UTC,"Why are all these people trying to justify a poorly designed class with these non-arguments of how roleplay should supercede stats?  If Dragonborn had been designed properly, OP wouldn't have an issue.   The fact is that the Dragonborn breath weapon is worse than a 1st-level spell, makes up way too much of the Dragonborn's racial perk budget, and quickly becomes obsolete, even in spite of its damage scaling.  Combine that with the Dragonborn's terrible ability score combination of Strength and Charisma, it's an all-around terrible race with barely a fraction of the perks of other races.  My advice to the OP is to ask your DM if you can just get more perks on the Dragonborn, and also switch it to +2 CON/+1 STR or something. I'd say Dragonborn needs at bare minimum, 50% more perk budget than it has, in order to be on-par."

dndnext,3dljtp,t0beyeus,3,Fri Jul 17 13:26:33 2015 UTC,"They aren't. Stat-wise they make great Paladins but they aren't designed specifically to be Paladins. They are designed to be ferocious and strong like a dragon and cunning and charismatic like a dragon.  They can be good at anything that utilizes their added Str or Cha. With the ability to increase attributes they can also be good at any class even a Wizard, since they can still get Int to 20."
dndnext,3dljtp,mattw891,-2,Fri Jul 17 14:36:32 2015 UTC,"They can be good at anything that utilizes their added Str or Cha.   That's just pure ignorance. Ability Score mod makes an enormous difference to overall damage.  Around 15-25% per point. Feats similarly also make a huge difference to damage, which compete with your ability score increases. A well optimized character will probably end up at least 50% stronger than a poorly optimized one."
dndnext,3dljtp,Strill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:03:39 2015 UTC,"An ability Mod is only a 5% difference. Where are you getting 15-25%. The minimum a race will take is 8 for a -1, the maximum any race will get is 20 for a +5.  20 Cha = 19 Spell DC/11 Spell Atk, 19 Cha = 18 Spell DC/10 Spell Atk."
dndnext,3dljtp,mattw891,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:11:49 2015 UTC,"It's a 5% absolute chance, but not relative to the damage you deal.   If I have a 50% chance to hit, and deal 1d8 + 3 damage, then a +1 ability mod will increase me to a 55% chance to hit, and 1d8 + 4.    My net average damage before, was 7.5 * 0.5 = 3.75.  My net average damage after, is 8.5 * 0.55 = 4.675.  Therefore, a +1 ability mod bonus increased my damage by 4.675 / 3.75 = 1.247 = 25% more damage"

Half of your 15% difference, less than 1/3rd of your 25%.  You don't always have a 50% change to hit, it changes based on the enemy, due to AC and Saves. It is still an average of about 5%.  You example also only shows a difference of 1 damage. Dice don't give a percent of a point. So if we round up both numbers it is a difference of 1 damage between 4 and 5."
dndnext,3dljtp,mattw891,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:44:09 2015 UTC,"So a 7% difference in damage. Half of your 15% difference, less than 1/3rd of your 25%.   That's because you made several mistakes and underestimations.   You choose the increase from +4 to +5, which is the lowest relative increase. You calculated maximum damage, not average damage. This is an underestimate. You completely neglected the increase in chance to hit.    You don't always have a 50% change to hit, it changes based on the enemy, due to AC and Saves. It is still an average of about 5%.   Even if we don't know what the opponent's AC/save will be, we can still calculate a worst-case scenario, and know that we will get at LEAST that much benefit from an ASI.  The worst-case scenario, is when your chance to hit increases from 95% -> 100%.  Therefore, in the case of Agonizing Blast, your damage increase will look as follows:   19 CHA: 4d10 + 16 = 38 average damage per hit 20 CHA: 4d10 + 20 = 42 average damage per hit 38 * 0.95 = 36.1 average damage 42 * 1.0 = 42 average damage   42 / 36.1 = 16.3% overall average damage increase (WORST CASE)  So we know that a +1 ASI in this case, will give us at LEAST +16.3% overall damage, and in practice, will probably give us even more.   You example also only shows a difference of 1 damage. Dice don't give a percent of a point. So if we round up both numbers it is a difference of 1 damage between 4 and 5.   I'm not calculating the damage dealt in any particular round.  I'm calculating average damage.  Fractional points of damage are completely warranted."
dndnext,3dljtp,Strill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:03:37 2015 UTC,"Too much math for me. You more or less just ruined the spirit of playing a roleplaying game.  I see what you are saying but you make it sound like a Half Elf and Dragonborn aren't going to get 20 Cha. Both can start with a +3 modifier at level 1. Both can choose to have a +4 modifier at level 4. The only benefit I see is that the player wants a Finesse Dex melee build. Half Elf can get a +3 at level 1, Dragonborn cannot. The player wants to go 1 level in Fighter and will thus get either Medium or Heavy armor. That means the player would only benefit from a 14 in Dex for Medium and wouldn't benefit from Dex for Heavy armor. He is then only using his Dex over 14 or 10 for melee damage.  If we are discussing optimization, then people should be telling the player if he wants a Dragonborn Warlock he should go Str based not Dex based. He should start at level 1 as a Warrior for Heavy armor, then Multiclass into Warlock. He can reach 20 Str and 20 Cha and will have Plate armor and a shield for 20 Armor. That leaves him 1 Feat he can get and put towards Warcaster so he can cast Eldritch Bolt with a weapon and Shield in hand."
dndnext,3dljtp,t0beyeus,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"Its not half bad on Fighters or Barbarians either, although I don't think they get quite the boost from the CHA as paladin, unless you're roleplaying as being very intimidating."
dndnext,3dljtp,t0beyeus,-2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:59 2015 UTC,"My personal guess is that they wanted them to make good fighters and sorcerers, but ignored the fact that neither of those classes care about the other class's stat.  It's the same as the reasoning the devs make in the DMG secion on making the Aasimar.  They give them +2 CHA +1 WIS because they're supposed to be good clerics and paladins, without caring that only one of those stats is good for either class."
dndnext,3dljtp,Strill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:34:15 2015 UTC,"Granted, 5e is my first D&D game, so I'm still new to this, but I'm guessing some of these are based off of what the races natural abilities would be. Aren't Aasimar the angelic equivalent to Tieflings? That would make them thematically wise and scary. Even if you aren't religious, look at people's reactions when angels appeared before people in the Bible. They were scared out of their minds. And they were incredibly wise (admittedly, they also appeared incredibly strong.) So these two stats make sense (assuming I haven't confused two races.) Sure, it hurts min/maxers, but makes sense. Also, what preacher/priest that wants to be heard isn't going to be charismatic? It might not affect his spells, but it would help him/her be heard by the masses, spreading the good news about their god."

If the first group goblins goes down too easily and you're worried because you have two more very similar ones coming up change them on the fly as well!  An extra hit die, a few extra points of damage and maybe a few of them have single uses of a fighters battle maneuver and you turned it up a notch.  Or throw a few in heavy armor and ones a class holding a bless spell.  Maybe one is a warlock in the back line of another group.  Sometimes it's as simple as having a group prepared to surprise the party; if they aren't careful they get a surprise round, but if they take too long then the enemy has time to buff or get in defensive positions.

So you will need to try stuff and then add or detract stuff as you see fit. (usually the basic pattern of 2 medium fights 1 short rest 2 medium fights, 1 short rest, 2 medium fights, 1 long rest.) Use something like http://kobold.club/fight/ But don't take it for gospel, adding up total CR sometimes gives a better idea than XP thresholds, adding some low CR critters can push a fight little, but does not instanly make it deadly as it suggests.  And you will need to determine what kind of campaign you want.  You can have a super easy magic items for all story or super difficult campaign with people dying left and right, but you might want to talk to your players if they have preferences.  Don't worry too much about balancing every encounter, because it is up to players to use the information they got to estimate if they should run or use tactics. Personally I find fairness is everything, the party faces an easy version of a fight with a new type of enemy first, which can go all over the place because they don't know the enemy tricks. Once they know what everything does and they don't run from a giant group of them, their mistake."

With regards to jargon, Bonus Actions are actually Minor Actions, except they don't want to call them that because Minor Actions are a 4e thing. Same with Actions instead of ""Standard Actions"", which actually has some straight-up detrimental effect to the readability of the text.  EDIT: It's also worth nothing that ""at-will"" is a descriptor that was used rather often in 3rd Edition as well. It's not even jargon because that's literally what it means: saying a spell is usable ""at-will"" conveys the information to a layman far faster than having to explain what a ""cantrip"" is, for example.  EDIT EDIT: the thread really sounds like an example of Not Invented Here Syndrome, or the rejection of a concept external to a group, simply because it is external."
dndnext,3dmfbx,SirPeebles,11,Fri Jul 17 14:07:50 2015 UTC,"Swift actions (3rd edition), minor action (4th edition), and bonus action (5th edition) are all similar but subtly different concepts. In particular, the hierarchy of action types where higher types can mimic lower types is gone in 5th edition.  That said, I strongly dislike the term ""bonus action"" because it sounds so much like you are just gaining an additional action as some sort of bonus."
dndnext,3dmfbx,Puns-Kill-Kittens,4,Fri Jul 17 14:15:56 2015 UTC,"I actually found the change in terms to be really useful for getting out of the mind set of previous editions. I think that the designers changed the name precisely because the actions are subtly different, and not merely for the sake of tasting different from previous editions.  For bonus action, I think that you're right that it implies that you're getting a sort of bonus. And I think that that's entirely appropriate. For the first few weeks playing 5e, my group was constantly arguing whether things should be an action or a bonus action like how we used to argue whether things were standard or minor in 4e. It finally set in that you don't get a bonus action by default. You only get it if a specific ability says you get it. Hence bonus.   Also I'd like to say you're one of my favorite redditors on this sub."
dndnext,3dmfbx,Domriso,0,Fri Jul 17 16:33:14 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more, the action economy changed pretty dramatically for 5e. The kinds of things that are bonus actions seem very different (to me) than the kinds of things that were Minor actions in 4e. They kept Free Action the same because it describes the same thing as it always has, but the others needed some distinction.  As to the change from Standard Action to Action, I think this increases readability. It's a shorter word. ""As An Action"" sounds nice (and is used a ton in board gaming). And I don't think any meaning is lost by dropping ""Standard""."

They didn't recharge just because the encounter ended, technically, since you had to finish the short rest before they recharged.  It's just that a short rest was only 5 minutes, and therefore was assumed after every encounter, unlike 5e. Hence dropping the term 'encounter power' as shorthand for 'recharges on a short rest.  But there are a couple places in the 5e PHB where they still refer to things being ""once per day"", even though that's technically 3e terminology. (AFAIK, They're all errata'd out.) 'Daily' is still perfectly good shorthand for 'recharged on a long rest' since you can only have one long rest per day."
dndnext,3dmfbx,Domriso,2,Fri Jul 17 18:28:10 2015 UTC,"Huh, encounter powers ARE recharged on short rests. I stand corrected. You're right though, I think it was only in Lair Assaults (and whatever other circumstances DM fiat comes into play) where no short rests were assumed to occur between combats, which lead to the thinking that encounter powers just recharged after encounters as a given."

Page 261 of the DMG gives advice on session based advancement which is what this would be.  Working in specific numbers via milestones (same page) would require a lot of math and balancing the numbers to make things work out and honestly you'd end up with something like session based advancement in the end if you did all of the math just right.
dndnext,3dk8mz,techiesgoboom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:53:01 2015 UTC,That doesn't really work when I am level 4 playing a session with level 8 or 9 people and want to catch up.  A lot of those potential players have other lives and will only be able to play occasionally.  OP should calculate appropriate XP for the challenge/level of the players and  hand it out at each session (it doesn't have to be an exact science).  That way the exponential nature of the exp requirements will allow lower level people to catch up without slowing down regular comers.

I thought that XP was gained regardless of play if the ""players can come and go and will have been adventuring nearby"" part assumes that the characters who are not active that session are still doing something on the sidelines. The milestones allow for no one to be left behind.  The second paragraph does suggest the opposite though.  That being said, depending on how fast you want the group to level. Set XP to a fraction of their level, say 10/20/25/33%. To be honest, the way some sessions get bogged down flat attendance XP can be a bad thing, out-levelling the campaign itself for instance."

It is much like what you want, with different groups of PCs doing different things, sometimes overlapping each other in terms of events.  I tried to do something akin to Dungeon World, in that I reward players 50 or 100 xp for finding out new world information or crucial world information. This could be something as simple as learning the location of a new city, developing a trade route between cities, discovering that the rumors of legends or lore about a location is true, or something rudimentary like finally getting rid of the last of a street gang in a small town.

dndnext,3dkzp6,NullSoldier,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:00:12 2015 UTC,"5E @ FG  This is a tutorial playlist I made awhile back, giving a crash-course in using FG to play 5E.  There's three tutorials showing Player perspective, the DM's tools, and how to build adventures/manage campaigns.  I won't make you watch all that, but if you're interested in FG and what it offers, I think it's a good jumping off point.  The short version is this:  I have a campaign right now called ""DragonQueen"".  When I open it and my players connect, it has all of their characters (on a very powerful character sheet), some generic maps that I use for random encounters, and some notes pages belonging to the players and a few for myself.  That's it.  If I open my library, I can ""open"" my adventure modules (currently we're in Rise of Tiamat).  When I open it, I have the entire adventure loaded into my campaign, with every word of text, every map and image, every NPC (with rollable attacks and abilities), every item (ready to drag and drop onto the party), and every token, along with every encounter and treasure parcel.  I open up a story entry that has the table of contents, and everything is hyperlinked from there.  As we're playing the party approaches a goblin cave from the adventure; I click on the map link and it pops up, and I share it, so all the players now see it.  I click on the encounter, and the 4 goblins are added to the combat tracker, and autoplaced on the map, but the players don't see them.  Their initiative is pre-rolled, and each goblin had a random number appended to their name.  As the combat ensues I lock player tokens so they proposed move is shown, but I have to click it to approve it.  Whenever one of the players attacks a goblin, he can target it on the map (or combat tracker) and it displays his target to everyone.  He rolls his attack and it auto-resolves against the goblin's AC, indicating if it was a hit or miss.  He rolls damage and it's auto-applied to goblin's HP.  On the goblins' turns, I target players, and roll their prebuilt attacks and damage, again all autoresolving.  At the end of the encounter they find a magic sword.  I drag the item link onto the party window, and they decide to give it to the fighter, who drags it onto his character sheet.  The attack and damage rolls are automatically built.  The Combat Tracker and Party Window are just... amazing.  Those alone make DMing with FG just awesome.  When you add in adventure modules, it's just flat out beyond comparison incredible.  Anyway, that's why I love it.  I'd recommend looking at those three videos if you want a quick summary of FG.  There's two more videos showing how to use PAR5E to create custom library modules, but you don't need them to have a great time with FG, nor do you need them to make adventure modules.  Summary: Combat Tracker Adventure Modules Party Window  These are the three things I get from FG that I don't get elsewhere.  They are incredible--and I even use FG at my face-to-face games now, specifically for these things."

My system will strive to have no friction and jumping into a game. Click a link and it generates a new session or joins an existing on in the browser. 3D to try to simulate the table top experience more without making it a game. All 3D will be is a 3D model of a table, and still give you board game pieces looking characters to move around. Well done user experience. Don't use custom UI paradigms to make it look cool, just make it easy to use and get out of the players way so they can interact with the game not tons of crappy UI windows and make UI features opt in rather than opt out.

I had to create an account before it would let me start building. I'm not convinced that should be necessary. They also have a poor implementation of a market since they don't curate assets / packages. I also find Roll20's usability to be poor.  Tabletop simulator looks like a disaster for table top games. I've watched a handful of youtube videos of people attempting to play, and it's really just not optimized for table top games like DND. It also looks awful because they try to do things outside the scope of table top gaming and not just perfect playing table top games in a digital environment. IE: trying to animate figures and messing around with the 3D environments look cumbersome and tacky.  I also think Fantasy Grounds is also not very accessible because it requires you to download a client.

A someone who has run multiple year long games online, I'll drop a few things about what I learned:   There is no way to predict who will stay and who will leave. The internet grants us the great ability to avoid awkward goodbyes by simply dropping off the face of the world. Unless you decide to get to know your players a little you'll never really know if there gonna stay. Test for flakes. One of the main banes to any party are the people who flake. It can be tempting to take on anyone who shows interest, but always respond to people with a question to see if they will even get back to you.  Consider try outs. I've got a good sense about who will be a good player and who will be a less good player, what your willing to put up with will depend on you but the best way to get the most out of the game is to sort through people until you have a strong group. If your really worried about getting people you enjoy playing with consider running a few one off sessions to get an idea how your applicants will play. Be very cautious about letting your players invite people. Someone could probably write a psychological essay on this, but there is often a big difference between players who applied to join your game and ones that you invited in with no barrier. Invited players will not always give due to respect to the game, so try not to accept people without testing them first (Regardless what other people say about them). If you want to get players easily run a popular game like 5th edition or pathfinder. If you want a play something a bit more niche you might need to secure a group first by running a more popular system first."

Originally, it was going to be rogue with a heavy charlatan background that he abused the divination for, but I'm concerned about falling behind everyone else in usefulness due to the two levels of wizard for pure flavor reasons. That's why I was hoping to find something that might synergize particularly well."
dndnext,3djbn9,techiesgoboom,5,Thu Jul 16 19:13:45 2015 UTC,"An alternative is to go variant human with the feat ""magic initiate"" for the innate magical background.  Otherwise any multiclass option that starts with wizard will be inherently worse than if your first level was of primary class followed by two in wizard.  When cross classing you only gain the benefits spelled out on 164 of the PHB for the new class rather than starting benifts.  As such if you care about wearing armor or using weapons that will take a lot of feats.  Another alternative is to mechanically gain the benefits of taking of taking your (say fighter) first and wizard second while still having your backstory be that you were a wizard who gave it all up to fight.  If you were coming to the table with two different versions of wiz2/fighter1, one starting with wizard and one with fighter.  There is precisely 0 mechanical benefit to going wizard first.  There is absolutely nothing you gain except slightly different starting equipment by doing so.  if you were coming to my table with this problem (and I imagine most DMs would feel the same) I'd say pick the mechanics you prefer and the backstory that you want."
dndnext,3djbn9,kyoujikishin,4,Thu Jul 16 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"well comparing to other players, the 2 level dip will probably be quite an interruption to your damage scaling. For the most part, all martial classes will get keep you a factor in combat. The 2 levels of wizard may increase your helpfulness out of combat (unless there is already a dedicated wizard).  Honestly, going into bard/charlatan sounds like a good combo both thematically while being able to build off the 2 lvls of arcane magic already known from the wizard."

Yeah, you'll be a bit behind in your rogue abilities, but it's all good, because you'll have your magic tricks to make up for it.

From a build/mechanical perspective, arcane trickster & wizard work well together for spells slots & spells known. Use Portent to make them fail their saves vs your Illusion spells. You will be able to make up for the less sneak attack with utility. Plus, you said store game, so I 'm guessing array which will make you less MAD (multiple abilities dependant) than going to a wisdom or charisma class.  Finally, storywise your rogue chose a new path but still kept his magic tricks to help him in his new endeavours!"

dndnext,3djbn9,rollingForInitiative,3,Thu Jul 16 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"Thematically, I think it fits well with a Knowledge Cleric, because ... well, they're both two awesome archetypes of knowledge-seekers, in different ways.   If you go mostly for utility from the Wizard, maybe a Paladin? If you roll a 20 on a portent, you can just blow someone away with a crit and Divine Smite. And you get a couple of more spell slots for smites or utility spells, as well.   The Eldritch Knight multiclasses really well with any Wizard. I think something like EK 6 -> Wizard 5 -> EK 11 ... is supposedly a very decent progression. But I guess an EK with a touch of Wizard wouldn't be awful either :)   Really though, I think most classes could benefit from 2 levels of Divination Wizard. You can even get away with a low Intelligence, which won't matter if you do it mostly for the utility spells."

Generic high rolls can also serve as good tools to make sure you don't miss any saves that would disable you (and render your barbarian impotent or a threat to the party). Alternatively, you could also go for a battlemaster fighter, and play off the idea that the character is good with the maneuvers because he/she knows what is going to happen.  Edit: Depending on how quickly you have to get this flavor going (as in is the campaign right now?), could wait for Mystic to release as they are highly likely to keep that kind of flavor."

Because of this, match it up with something that relies heavily on high success rates.   a Barbarian/Fighter/Paladin/Ranger aren't going to have as big of a problem with Accuracy, because they can last a long time with little problems. Plus their extra attacks means that they'll be making more chances at hitting things.  One class that works well with Divination is the Arcane Trickster. since Rogues only get 1 attack, making sure their single-turn Sneak Attack hits, or even crits, is very important. The Arcane Trickster is all about getting advantage against the enemy as well, meaning you'll be doing better already. Plus, the Arcane Trickster uses Illusion and Enchantment spells, which both rely a lot on enemy saving throws, which you can overthrow with your Portents.   Another good option is the Dragonborn, who's Breath weapon also requires a saving throw, which can be helped with Portents."

Don't imperil a working group until you've explored some options."

Page 5   DUNGEONS & DRAGONS isn't a head-to-head competition, but it needs someone who is impartial yet involved in the game to guarantee that everyone at the table plays by the rules. As the player who creates the game world and the adventures that take place within it, the DM is a natural fit to take on the referee role.   Page 6   The success of a D&D game hinges on your ability to entertain the other players at the game table. Whereas their role is to create characters (the protagonists of the campaign), breathe life into them, and help steer the campaign through their characters' actions, your role is to keep the players (and yourself) interested and immersed in the world you've created, and to let their characters do awesome things.

It is, at its core, meant to be fun for everyone involved. Not the players, not the DM, not some of the group. Everyone! If the game isn't fun, it is at the entire group level to try and fix it.   You've already tried talking to the problem group member personally about it. That was the right move to make. Often people don't realize a lot of DnD is about a group, and not the single person. Unfortunately, the group member didn't want to talk, just give out ultimatums.  Next step, and this really is key, is bring it up at the group level, to everyone, in the open.  Don't try and go behind other group members and badmouth or discuss group level issues. Talk with everyone, see if the rest of the group feels the same way, and hopefully the DM will realize that something is off, and you guys need to change your dynamic to have fun."

If he still keeps at it ... leave. Just make sure you aren't rage-quitting and that this isn't just based on a misunderstanding. Try to talk him again, but if he does keep at it, then quit. If you're not having fun, you shouldn't stay.   The other person who left - find out if they want to start another group. Maybe some of the others would want to join as well, with a new DM. You don't need a permanent DM, maybe you could rotate it, do an adventure each.   Not sure how old you are or how much money you've got, but if you formed a new group, maybe you could buy a new PHB together, split the cost, and get a new MM later on. Since it sounds you were doing great before, you could probably keep it up with just a PHB. But don't stay with a douche just because he spent money. You don't have any obligation to do so."
dndnext,3dhapf,rollingForInitiative,7,Thu Jul 16 08:52:43 2015 UTC,"Since you're all so new, he may not know how to create a dynamic campaign.

I'd even let him DM. He may be good at it, given the chance to learn. It's tough to create dungeons and encounters on the fly, when you've never played D&D before, much less been the DM for it.  Most importantly, do all this out in the open. Nothing will split friendships quicker than behind-closed-doors type discussions. Don't try to mutiny. Just say you want to start with the starter set.

DnD is not about the DM writing a story and trying to stick to it.  It's about creating a world with NPCs, villains and monsters that have their own goals and motivations.  You provide a short story to set everything up, getting the players invested, and from there you let them interact with the world.  It produces a lot less anxiety when you DM the game in that fashion as well, since 90% of the time the players will deviate from the plans in your head.  However, if all you have in your head is what's in the world and what it wants to do, you can easily react to the player's choices.  I recommend sending your DM friend over to http://theangrygm.com/ and having him read articles.  That and have him read the GM section of Dungeon World.  That information will completely change how he runs a game.  I guess I'm saying, he looks like he has the motivation to want to be a GM with all his prep and purchasing.

dndnext,3dhapf,KiqueDragoon,8,Thu Jul 16 17:10:55 2015 UTC,"Thing is everything you have described here is Classic New to Role Playing  Quite simply  DM:  Is making you tell his story instead of setting the scene for the players to tell their story in.  It's hard to create whole dynamic worlds from scratch Especially on the spot. Now you are asking someone who has never even played a solid full campaign to do so without rules knowledge.  Speak to him as a group and tell him you feel rail roaded rather than having the option to tell a story as your characters.  DM needs to be open to hearing what his players want and accepting his vision of the story is just that ""His vision"" and is very very unlikely to be the story that is told. As they say in the PHB and the DMG it is a collaborative story telling endeavor. This can take a very very long time to learn.  Player: Coming to Reddit rather than as a group working out the problem amongst yourself in a meaningful way. Coming to a place like this is the equivalent of spitting your dummy. We cant actually help you other than with advise. Often it's not going to be what you want to hear.  As a player your part of telling the story it so help the DM do so. Accepting that not every DM is great work with him as a group rather than against him. At the end of a session say as a group hey this didn't work for us. But we really enjoyed these parts.  As new players with a new DM you cannot expect fully dynamic storylines. I agree the full rail road treatment doesn't work either though.  The only way to resolve this and potentially stay as a group is to sit down and talk it through. But be sure you are not the odd man out.  Group: Know what you like. If your DM is the type who loves playing the combat style adventure then thats the story he is likely to run. This can be a serious problem for a group thats far more into the social side of things.  As new players all round this is going to take time and a lot of patience and willingness to work with each other to actually smooth out the kinks.  It talks discussion and the willingness to make mistakes and go with those mistakes for the sake of everyones fun.  There will come a time where you have to as a group decide to stick with something, wrap up a campaign or split apart and find different groups.    You also now run into the issue that he has spent a lot of money on stuff so there is going to be that sense of my stuff my game. Again the only way to deal with that is to work collaboratively to get to a point where everyone is having fun. Thing is railroad stories can be great fun if the events inside it are memorable. And to be honest its a good place to start learning as new players. Hand wave shopping, finding new animal shapes and the mundane stuff. Skipping from event to event is not going to hurt especially while everyone finds there feat.  When talking to each other don't criticism.  Sentences should be,  I enjoyed or I felt this didn't work for me.  Not  You should have done this, This part sucked.  TL/DR Focus on the FUN. Work together as a group to find a middle ground where everyone is enjoying themselves. But it has to be done as a group. Be forgiving of each others mistakes and be open to people telling you what didn't work for them."

While I can understand a new DM wanting players to stick together and keep things simple as he settles into the role of DMing, to begin in such a manner is very off-putting.  He sounds like he has personality issues.  The total disrespect for what had happened in your campaign before (he eradicated what you had done with a simple hand wave), the inflexibility in adapting to the party's actions, the whole 'these are your Minis'.  I picked up on the last one because I play Theatre of the Mind with no Minis, and have my own mental image of my characters - if I was forced to use a Mini I would choose one myself and paint it as close to my mental image as possible.  Though it must be said, you are not making it all that easy for him as a group - stop splitting up.  Come to compromises.  Some want to investigate a cave, others want to buy supplies, Druid wants to check out forest, why not stop for an hour to quickly stock up before heading out to the Caves, and tell the Druid he can check out the forest when you all return - and stick to that plan.  But ultimately, I don't see much future with a DM with his attitude. He's a control freak.

dndnext,3dhapf,WizardoftheSea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:27:31 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you already know that leaving the game is an option, and that you want another solution.   I'm going to hazard a guess that your DM has his ego invested in his ability to tell this story. This could be for multiple reasons: Perhaps be really wants the power trip of running a game. Or he was seeing the praise you were getting for running your own game and wanted a piece of that sweet validation pie.   Your best bet is to approach the DM a second time, but get some backup from the rest of the players. Make sure that you all are in agreement about what you don't like about the game, and see if you can figure out some advice on what would make it better for the group. Also, decide ahead of time if you want to continue with him as DM or not.   When you do approach your DM again, start out by stating a few things you like about his style before starting into the criticism. If the group has decided they want someone else to DM, tell him that straight up. Otherwise, end it be saying that people aren't having fun (with backup from others this time) but you want to help him improve the game.   Try to sound like you're offering help rather than criticism, but also emphasize that the group is in danger if things don't improve."
dndnext,3dhapf,marco262,3,Thu Jul 16 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed, give him a complement sandwich (complement, complaint, complement). That should help him not feel attached and may make him more open to suggestions. I will even give you the first one: Love the fact that he is diving head first into a position that most people cower over and seems to take his position serious (a little too serious sadly).  Now, as others have said, as a first time DM it is REALLY hard to think of things of the fly. It may be best for you guys to grab the Starter Set with LMoP in it. It is a great campaign and has some open free-formness to it that will help your DM understand how to start weaving things together if the party opts to do X instead of Y or Z. Heck, just 5 minutes into the campaign you have a major decision point!  Also, I don't think you should be too upset that he nuked a lot of your setting. Does it suck that he couldn't work with it; yes (especially if you invested some time into creating it). But it isn't ""his"" world and may have a different idea of what a fantasy world should be. While you may think it is high magic and a solid good vs. evil he may want a more gritty world with political plots. There needs to be a serious discussion between the party & DM as to what they want out of the campaign. There will need to be concessions all sides on what everyone wants but by having this talk you will end up with a better game."
dndnext,3dhapf,SublimeBW,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:26:35 2015 UTC,"Iran,  I guess he's right.  Just leave, and take the other players with you if they're also having a bad time.

dndnext,3dhapf,Popichan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:18:29 2015 UTC,"I would definitely get the LMoP starter campaign. I'm currently DM'ing for the first time with three players and none of us have played prior to this. Even with the pre-generated content, it can be overwhelming for a DM when a situation comes up that wasn't expected.  Our group just finished our third session last night, and I can tell you one of the most important things I've learned is to keep the momentum going and don't be afraid to just make it up at times. The learning curve is steep, but we all walk away from each session having had a good time and learning a few more of the formal rules.

dndnext,3dhapf,Fuckitall2346,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:42 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of great advice here already.  I just wanted to add a (not-so) interesting aside.  Long, long ago, in the early editions of DnD, one player was the party leader and designated the ""caller.""  This player was responsible for relaying al actions of all party members to the DM.  Your description of how your DM acts, listening only to one player, reminded me of that, though he is likely far too inexperienced to know that.  I believe the caller developed from the evolution of war gaming into DnD.  Players were used to having commanders and a more military-based style of action and turn-taking.  As DnD evolved into a role-playing game, more individuality and freedom to act were introduced into the core rules, though chaotic characters were mechanically punished.  I also think that the calls for ""could a person really do that"" stem from this era too, where pleading one's case to the DM was part of the game and simulationism was more accepted.   For me, it has been fascinating to observe how DnD has changed and how different players from different backgrounds approach it.  I do hope you can encourage your DM to be more open and even-handed in running a fun game.  Sometimes though, you find not everyone is suited to a particular group and have to move on.  Good luck."

If there is a person not making it fun, then you simply stop playing with them. I have had to  do this twice in the past. Its not easy especially if your a non controntational type, but its gotta be done. Sounds like if he wants to take his goodies and go then he is not even really what I would call a friend, and thats the only people I play with. I don't play with randoms or strangers, because its more about having fun for me."

Vote with your dollar, or in this case, your time. The DM needs to know you won't play a railroad game in a system where anything SHOULD be possible. Find yourself a new dm or become one yourself. I can't tell you how often I will simply sit silently and wait for the party members to push their own story, and only help them sometimes with 'jogging their memory of events' or with rules questions to make A FUN, FRIGGIN, GAME."

Although in DnD is pretty cruel to atheists anyway, it's kind of like being insane to not worship a god. Unless you're a wizard in which case it hardly matters, honk honk."
dndnext,3di52d,Therval,7,Thu Jul 16 15:00:05 2015 UTC,The existence of several gods are objectively proven in most DnD worlds.  It's kind of like being an atheist in Discworld.

dndnext,3di52d,WizzardofAus,2,Thu Jul 16 14:08:08 2015 UTC,"5e says nothing about needing a god as a paladin. It is a likely path, but not required.   Your paladin might follow Helm, and he might also have his own ideas about how Helm might execute his will. I don't see Helm not aligning with a vengeance paladin, but if you think its a little off perhaps your paladin believe helm has been angered and you are his bearer of divine retribution. Add a little crazy into your role play."
dndnext,3di52d,Hasire,2,Thu Jul 16 15:20:46 2015 UTC,When I read I had this idea of a Paladin (not needing a God). I do not know if my GM likes this idea (because Forgotten Realms seems to have a lot of deity focus).  I like the idea of Helm being angered. Thanks for the tip!

Like say a guy murders someone, you hunt them down so they cant do it again, thus protecting future victims. Otherwise I would suggest Tyr whos primary dogma is the punishment of wrong-doers. I noticed you were wondering about your powers too. From my understanding, Paladins and Clerics are favoured creatures of the gods so your divine abilities are yours but you have been granted them by your diety. If you were to lose faith, you might lose your powers and become more of a fighter or there is the 'Dark Paladin' archetype, available in the DM guide"

dndnext,3di52d,Kangodo,3,Thu Jul 16 14:31:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on your DM. I for example have a DM who is willing to let me play a Lawful Death cleric since I can explain it like, the angel of death doesnt kill people, they just die and he ferries their souls. Its not evil, just lawful neutral. Same could be done for the unoathed paladin. Even so, Tyr seems to fit perfectly with your 'retribution at any cost' you mentioned in another post ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyr_(Forgotten_Realms) Look at the 'Orders' section). If you really like Helm though (who has sometimes taken the role of enforcer), just see if theres a new angle you can work out with your DM"

dndnext,3di52d,hphammacher,5,Thu Jul 16 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"The 3 PHB Paladin archetypes, at least in my experience, break down into 3 different approaches of dealing with an invading army of ""the bad stuff"".  The Oath of Protection will inspire an entire town to fight against an oncoming army, and they will do it multiples of times better than if they were on their own. This is the guy who will teach you to fortify your walls, defend yourself from an attack, and make you want to do it with everything you've got.  The Oath of the Ancients will try and keep the common man from ever knowing how close ""the bad stuff"" really got. Guerrilla tactics, picking off entire squads on their own until the enemy is too atrophied by the sheer unrelenting enemy and leaves or is defeated in the actual battle because of their decreased strength.  The Oath of Vengeance will sneak into the enemy's camp, poison their food and water, slit the general's throat and never tell anyone he did it.  Any Oath can line up with any good deity. Vengeance is just the guy that needs to go in when evil doesn't fight fair and the only way to win without risk to anyone else is to fight back with the same tactics."
dndnext,3di52d,Hasire,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:43:22 2015 UTC,These are good views.  But can't Oath of Vengeance lie to good people so he can get to the truth? There are others instances where Oath of Vengeance can stain one's virtue.

dndnext,3di52d,onewithoutasoul,4,Thu Jul 16 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"I don't see why. He is a Lawful diety. Bringing justice to those who wish to destroy Law can and should be killed. Deities in DnD are not conceptual, they are actual things you can go talk to, and can be reasoned with. Helm would understand using questionable means to destroy a great evil.  Sounds more like your DM is going to make you fall instead of letting you play the character you wanted. Was he a 3e DM?"
dndnext,3di52d,hphammacher,2,Thu Jul 16 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, he pretty much only DMed 3e. He is using the old Forgotten Realms 3e book.  We're on our first campaign playing 5e."
dndnext,3di52d,hphammacher,4,Thu Jul 16 19:53:43 2015 UTC,"Remember the fourth tenet of the oath of vengeance. The one a lot of people overlook when discussing the oath. Your path is not just ""be the punisher"". You help people. You don't run from the law because you know your actions were justified and they should too. Hell, you could very easily interpret that last tenet in a rather depressing way. An oath of vengeance paladin might not have a lack of empathy like the punisher, they might have an excess. The suffering of innocents haunts you, and that is why you protect others by hunting evil done before it strikes again.  If your character finds a raided village, their first feelings should be guilt and shame. Guilt because you weren't there to save them and shame because no one else was righteous enough to do it either. You don't hunt evil for fun, you hunt evil because it doesn't deserve the right to exist and most people are too weak to fight it. You might not be the best PR for your deity, but if your deity hates evil then your work should speak for itself.  P.s. And if your deity still isn't happy with that, then tell it to go fuck itself and find one that actually does wants its followers to fight evil."
dndnext,3di52d,hphammacher,3,Thu Jul 16 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it has been mentioned in a sub-comment, but I don't find Oath of Vengeance all that great from a purely mechanical point of view. Once per short rest, you can get advantage against one target. Only one. Can't move it to a new target when you slaughter it in one round and the REAL BBEG pops out. And advantage, how easy is that to get? Sacrifice a weapon swing to shove a creature, it goes prone, and Advantage for you and all other melee characters until it gets up (loses 1/2 movement speed doing so).   The spells are pretty good, and the capstone is great, but the rest is forgettable. I'm a bigger fan of flavoring Oath of the Ancients towards an ancient being, like Mephisto (with DM approval) or Oath of Devotion for that Sacred Weapon.   That said, don't let a specific god limit what you want to do with the character. I wish you lots of fun."

Combine this with Greater Weapon Master to negate the -5 and just claim the +10 damage on each attack. Advantage equals more crits, we love crits. Relentless Avenger makes sure creatures can hardly run away from you. Soul of Vengeance gives you almost three attacks per round, compared to the two that other specs get. But the best thing must be the spells: Hold Person is great, because we do well when we crit. Then we also have Haste, Hunter's Mark and Hold Monster. Perfect!"

He has vowed vengeance upon liars and cheats and spends his time 'setting things right' like William of Baskerville.  But okay -- so maybe you don't want a rigid deity at all (that is, you don't want some other character altering the path your character will take)? How about this: we already know Paladins can swear an oath of Ancients to old-gods -- gods that are long forgotten.   Ask your DM if your power source can stem from some ancient, unknown, no-longer-worshipped power: a power that specifically idealizes equality or restitution --""that he might put retribution over his own virtues""--  basically, this god is a force of fairness:  if any creature is wronged, this god seeks to 'even the score.'   Without more information about what, specifically, calls this character towards 'retribution' it is hard to craft an alternative power source.  But I'm sure you have some ideas!  Explain to your DM that you'd rather your power to stem from your oath -- and that unless you break that oath, you don't expect your powers will be lost -- if your DM agrees not to mechanically harm your character, then I think RP-wise you could have a lot of fun being a 'Prodigal son' of Helm."

dndnext,3di52d,Hasire,3,Thu Jul 16 16:00:37 2015 UTC,"Well then why not just Oath of Devotion? Vengeance is more or less a ""the ends justify the means"" sort of character.  You can still be a justice bringing as an Oath of Devotion paladin, just without being the brutal hammer of justice. Devotion paladins are more or less the classic D&D paladin. AKA you're against ALL injustice.  Oath of Vengeance seems more or less that you would be against a specific injustice. Back to my undead example. You'd be going after all necromancers no matter what, because that's your duty. You can work with demons and devils as long as you get those nasty necromancers.  An Oath of Devotion paladin would fight to bring to justice/destroy ALL evil."

dndnext,3dgr6c,Kindulas,5,Thu Jul 16 03:36:51 2015 UTC,"I really like the core pact. It's a very potent power but with a fairly potent drawback. I definitely don't think that the Blood Blast thing is needed, metamagic as a pact boon is definitely enough.  However, I'm slightly more sceptical about the invocations. For one, there's probably too many. No other pact boon gets nearly as much support, so this outshines them. Furthermore, most of them are a bit too powerful. Beating Heart is totally fine, but the other three could use some tweaking.  Sangrosurge is just too much of a numerical increase in my opinion. I think that gaining advantage on the saving throw instead of adding the hit die expended would be more elegant and sticks with 5E's philosophy of not making the player have to deal with lots of fiddly dice added onto a roll most of the time.   Kali-Ma is excessive in my opinion, it trivializes the sacrifice of hit dice.  Beating Heart diminished it, but in a more controlled way since it was tied to long resting. To be honest I would axe this one completely.  Additional Sangromancy is fine except for the fact it can be taken until you have all the metamagics, which makes you a better metamagic caster than a sorcerer. I would cap it at three metamagics known personally.  That said I do like the theme of the pact boon and would be really interested in seeing it develop! :)"
dndnext,3dgr6c,Intuentis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:04:17 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much in agreement: this is a great way to handle blood magic, but some of the extra stuff is definitely too much.  I'm not sure 'too many invocations' is a thing, but I'm definitely not sure about the ones as posted."
dndnext,3dgr6c,jmartkdr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:06:15 2015 UTC,"I guess it comes down to personal taste, but I think that if one pact boon has four invocations, one of which can be taken up to five times and the other three have two or less, people might be more inclined to take the boon with more invocations because it makes the boon seem more versatile. I see where you're coming from though, either way you're paying for the invocation from your limited list of them so any significant balance issue would more be a symptom of the power of the invocations rather than a sign that lots of invocations is intrinsically overpowered."
dndnext,3dgr6c,Intuentis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes. I do think some of the invocations as written are too much, but they'd be too much if they were the only new option.   Alternatively, I could homebrew up five more invocations for Pact of the Blade and whether or not their overpowering is more dependent on how the invocation are phrased (and with respect to that pact - what you're comparing them to) than the fact that I didn't homebrew up an equivalent number for the Pact of the Chain."
dndnext,3dgr6c,jmartkdr,2,Thu Jul 16 14:20:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you with regards to power (I didn't actually say that having lots of invocations was overpowering the other boons in my original post anyway, just that it outshone them since it made the boon more versatile). Again, my issue is more down to one boon opening more options than the others, rather than power-hence my lack of concern that the Tome Pact only gets one invocation, since that invocation expands the Warlock's horizons considerably."
dndnext,3dgr6c,Intuentis,7,Thu Jul 16 14:23:44 2015 UTC,Excellent thoughts on not overkilling your homebrew and this seems like an great pact
dndnext,3dgr6c,Cenycal,3,Thu Jul 16 05:04:54 2015 UTC,While the idea of the pact sounds great I'm generally not a fan of spending hit dice for damage. This will probably end up with people throwing away hit dice to shine in combat and annoy the party by requiring heals or long rests.  While the Constitution influence is ofcourse flavorful they're also a bit meh. You're giving 1 class 2 spells casting stats that they have to keep at a decent level.  Mechanic wise I think Kali-Ma needs a CR requirment on the target. Else I could delay my adventure to hunt for rodents to drain.

dndnext,3dgr6c,Ceiling90,2,Thu Jul 16 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"I like it. It plays well with everything.  I think switching the casting stat at level 3 is too much, I'd leave it at Cha. The pact itself allows you follow through on sacrificing blood to ""power up"" your spells.  I'm also fine with letting it be any Hit Die, because Hit Die are a finite resource, that is if you forget that they exist at all.   (Note: I feel that many old time DM's forget this sort of resource exists, for a long time it was either the 5 minute workday or nothing)  Blood Blast actually beats out agonizing blast as the craziest damage boost every - ""when you deal damage"" is the key phrase here that allows you to spend 4 HD to add  1d8 +2 per ray of eldritch blast.   (But that's a feature/bug of Eldritch Blast, versus anything else.)   If from the current errata, you'd only have to spend 1 HD to power up a spell like Scorching Ray - even if it has more than 1 ray, because than each ray would deal 3d10 + 1d8 + 2.   (I think I have that right.)  I mean, if I'm interpreting correctly, that's how it would work right? But that level 4, that means the warlock after two massive Blood soaked EB has to use a long rest to regain any HP without magical healing. And at best gains back 2 HD, to have 3 total the next day. BTW I think each ray at level 4 would do something like 1d10 + 1d8 + 3 + 2 damage. (3 HD used in nova - 2 HD to blood blast and quicken the first EB, then another to blood blast the second EB).   Other thoughts:  If you make a full patron - one that features more blood themed ""quirks"", but not necessarily rely on the Pact of the Vein, you could work in the Kali-ma and Sangrosurge; they could be built as class features.  I feel the patron would have a lot of necromancy and other type of spells like vampiric touch as expanded spell list.  I'm contemplating it now."
dndnext,3dgr6c,Ceiling90,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:35:23 2015 UTC,Blood Blast relies on Metamagic rules that limit them to one per spell. I think that's how it works anyway.

dndnext,3dhz2v,Avex4,2,Thu Jul 16 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat. I'm at 6 levels of paladin (and id recommend you stick it out until you get aura at 6) but I'm considering taking 3 fighter levels next for maneuvers.   The trade off is 3rd level spells (haste!), moving 15ft on AoO and a feat.   You gain maneuvers (menacing and maneuvering seem best) a second fighting style, and action surge.   BM seems best if you want more control on the battlefield (also combining a maneuver and Smite on crits seems op) and action surge allows for some crazy nova turns."

I would just add that by going to 5 levels instead of 3 you'll get an extra attack, which means that at F5/P5 you'll have 3 attacks per round instead of the usual maximum of 2 for a Paladin, and you're not really giving up much - taking it to its extreme, L15 vs l17 paladin isn't that much of an advantage compared to an extra attack per round from level 10 onwards (and that's assuming you even reach character levels 19-20 when it would matter)"

dndnext,3diqqs,Gnostic_Nord,5,Thu Jul 16 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"I once made an adventure set in Shandalar. I never played, but the idea was to turn the players into a creature/card they loved. The party consisted of:  Knight Exemplar, Skinshifter, Serra Ascendant, Dwarf Recruiter, and in one case I had a monk because the player really liked Braid of Fire.  As for planeswalkers, that is extremely complicated to homebrew, but possible. Consider making character sheets for example planeswalkers, here are some thoughts.  Chandra: Sorcerer, (Draconic Bloodline Red for mechanical purposes only) lots of fire spells  Gideon: Some sort of Paladin or Eldritch Knight with abjuration, everybody knows he likes to get his hands dirty  Jace: Wizard with Enchantment/Divination  Garruk: Perhaps edit a Ranger class option maybe start at beast master, give him Great Weapon Fighting, and the possibility to spend spell slots to summon a single creature.  Liliana: Necromancy Wizard.  You will end up with a lot of Wizards and Sorcerers, so make sure to adjust the campaign accordingly. Remember that several spells in the PHB can be simply renamed or edited to sound like MTG spells  Firebolt deals 1d10 lightning damage and now it is Lightning Bolt, Shocking Grasp becomes Shock, Counterspell already exists and so on and so forth. Some cards can just be reinterpreted, compare Ranger's Guile(MTG Card) to Barkskin(Ranger Spell) for example.  On this same note, various red or white spells revolve around fighting maneuvers, making it possible for white or red or boros planeswalkers to be reskinned Battle Master fighters.

As for hiding it from other party members, I have never had a good experience with one party member hiding something from the rest of the party. It never creates the atmosphere you want and almost always leads to the party turning on each other. Having a secret the party helps a pc hide from the rest of the world, though, is awesome and brings the party closer together."
dndnext,3diix8,Sparticuse,10,Thu Jul 16 16:01:53 2015 UTC,I would not suggest that.  Players only control one thing in the game: their characters.  Taking that control away gives the players a feeling of helplessness and kills interest in the character and the game.    What you can do is discuss it with the player and encourage him to take the level.  Or you could give the player pact benefits while they do what the evil device desires.
dndnext,3diix8,one_comment_only,3,Thu Jul 16 15:49:52 2015 UTC,"Personally,  I've never had a problem letting party members have secrets. Everyone at my tables usually have multiple secret goals and quests. It makes the world feel a bit more real, and each person feels a bit more in control of their characters story.

dndnext,3diix8,constnt,6,Thu Jul 16 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"Bad call, IMHO. Never force anything onto your PCs.  Maybe flat out present the choice to them, such as telling them they feel the pull of evil power and blah blah blah to let them know that this choice will have direct consequences to their character, but no force.  I did that to one of my players, and he loved it. His mage screwed up, was in a bind, and in his weakness, allowed a piece of Vecna to inhabit him. Very likely death avoided, he then had to deal with his new passenger going forward.  Another option is to assign bonus abilities instead of forcing a new character path.  My current campaign has the characters empowered by a magical tome that gave everyone a bit of the bard class. But this is in addition to their character build, not instead of - allowing me to keep my plot plans intact without hurting character advancement."
dndnext,3diix8,Stridercal,3,Thu Jul 16 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"This post gave me an idea. What if you made the cursed sword have certain abilities that are generally Warlock? Pick a specific invocation and make it an effect of the sword. Make the sword summonable similar to a Bladelock's weapon. Maybe they regain a meager amount of health each time they defeat an enemy(whether they kill them or not). Be sure to not mention the sword is cursed. It is just a great sword that they found in an unusual situation. Imagine the inn-keeper announces that the player had a delivery and just give them the sword. They will probably think it is a bit forced and wonder who the sender is. It comes with instructions of it's benefits and is signed something like ""An Admirer"" or ""Your Biggest Fan"". Let them enjoy it and get used to how great it is. Then have it start acting up a bit. What if the sword appeared in their hand when they didn't summon it? This could happen at potentially inconvenient times for added amusement. Suddenly, they stop getting health for only defeating enemies and only gain it for killing enemies. At some point, I'd have another letter delivered that is a scroll for ""Find Familiar"". The letter would instruct them to cast it in private and be signed ""I look forward to seeing you soon"" with an actual name that isn't especially sinister. I'd probably have the letter appear somewhere unusual like in their pocket when they wake up in the morning. Once they summon the familiar, I'd have the familiar inform them of their lord. The power the sword has granted the player was but a small taste of power they could offer. It will last a while, but slowly diminish if they choose to reject their lord. However, if they choose to work for their lord, they will receive power beyond anything they have experienced yet. At this point, explain to that player that they are invited to take levels in Warlock."
dndnext,3diix8,WeylandTheDwarf,2,Thu Jul 16 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"As a DM, you should never force your PCs to do anything.  The idea is to give them choices with consequences.  Some things I've done for my PCs in the past:   PCs encounter a traveling Monk and befriend him through some adventures.  Monk offers to teach any who is willing to learn ways of expanding their minds (ie, gaining a Monk level).  Mechanically, this gave the PCs an option to make their next level, a Monk level.  They key is that I gave them a slight XP advantage if they took the Monk level.  So the choice becomes, do I make my next level a suboptimal Monk level for Role Playing reasons, but get it faster?  In the end, 1 of the 6 PCs took the Monk up on his offer, which RP wise started this Ranger down a new path of enlightenment. Part of the PC's story is that he is foretold to either be the savior or doom for his people.  The reason was that he basically was sold into the service of a devil, which granted him Warlock powers.  As the PC learned more of his past, he could keep gaining Warlock levels, further serving his demon master, or he could find an alternate path.  He ended up going full on Warlock, but throughout the story arc, changed his pact to a different demon."

dndnext,3diix8,Tehddy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"On the first: I wouldn't force it, but I'd talk to the player about it. If the player thinks a level or two of warlock sounds cool, they can rp their character being forced into it.  In general, it's a bad idea to tell a player how to play their character beyond setting limits that apply to everyone; and any such limits should be discussed before the game begins.  As for the second question: it's probably possible, but difficutl and probably not necessary. Just ask the players to try to play their charcaters as people with no concept of charcater classes beyond arcane/divine/marshal and it should work. Hiding it OOC tends to create trust issues, but hiding it IC can create interesting rp opportunities if everyone is in on it."
dndnext,3diix8,jmartkdr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"I think I like the idea of just giving the PC pact benefits when acting according to the will of the weapon, but not forcing the warlock level on them. The sword would effectively be baitingconvincing them to forge a true pact via positive reinforcement.   Also, keeping a secret from the party is fine IMO. But you should read your players. Are they capable of not meta gaming? Are they going to be upset if they find out someone kept a secret? If yes to both of these, there's no real reason to make it a secret, and ample reason not to. If you think your group would think it was awesome RP, then go for it. If you think your group will do stupid meta gaming stuff, then keep it a secret or discard the idea. You know your group better than us."
dndnext,3diix8,ManetherenRises,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone. Loads of good feedback. I think I've come across my plan:   If my players express interest in Warlock levels, I'm going to make it part of the storyline so a journey from A to B 'accidentally' takes them to a forgotten ruin. Inside the ruin they face off vs undead and golems, unlock magical doors and disarm traps.   Eventually they come across a fallen warrior , surrounded by his fallen enemies in a last stand. He holds a pristine sword while everything else in sight has decayed to ruin.   The players can loot the sword and bam - cursed.   The warrior, it turns out, was an evil mage Knight , and the fallen foes are the heroes who died to destroy him. The undead are wardens of the prison they built where he fell , so determined to contain him they condemn themselves to undeath to guard his corpse.   The sword ( could be a book or a knife or anything I can tempt a certain player with) then becomes it's own story. Once a player has enough Warlock levels they can destroy it, breaking the pact but they keep the power their patron 'leant' them.   Or! What are the rules on a PC 'unlearning ' a class?   Say the Warlock breaks free. Is he still a Warlock or would it be OK to say 'the power the patron gave you has faded but your stolen strength returns, giving you your lost levels back as a fighter?'"

And in general it is possible to keep most non caster classes a secret but you need to avoid spells and special class features that have discernable effects since spells  have components and sneak attack is obvious since it deals more damage."
dndnext,3diix8,techiesgoboom,0,Fri Jul 17 03:25:57 2015 UTC,"As the DM it's possible for you turn all of the players in giant slaads riding giant flying, fire breathing, mechanical, basilisks at level one through the plane of snakes eventually culminating into an epic adventure exploring the intestines of the Tarrasque as a strange blend of mice and psudodragons wielding nothing but lightning emitting bagpipes and frosty mugs of ale as weapons.  You're the DM, it's your game, what you say happens.  Period.  now the second question is the good one.  Is it ethical.  When it all boils down to it the purpose of DnD (and hell, of life in general) is for everyone at the table to have fun.  Whenever you make any decision at all, especially one concerning the PCs directly, ask yourself, will my players enjoy this overall?  (sometimes initially they might not be a fan of something but after a short amount of time come to love it.  Killing a character when they made mistakes and were in way over their head might make them a touch sad, but ultimately they will likely have more fun in a world with consequences to their actions.)  So if you know your players well enough to think they might enjoy something like this?  If so, go for it; you'll have fun, they'll have fun and everybody wins.  Now if instead you are unsure the best bet is to have a discussion about the general tone of the campaign, about their expectations as characters, etc.  If after this you can't figure out the answer without giving it all away your best bet is to play it a little safe.  If they are like many of the groups I've played with and DM'ed the player's character sheet is kind of sacred.  The player has ultimate control over what gets written on there.  While it's up to you to dictate what kinds of things they can and cannot do, it's generally taboo to take someone's sheet and start leveling for them (or for that matter to RP for the player outside of lycanthropy or enthrall or a similar effect that outright says to) and it's also taboo to force them to do something very specific like this.  If I were to implement this sort of item in my campaign I would make this a sentient, cursed sword.  The player would effectively have three options 1) take suggestions from the sword and try to please it and gain the benefits it has to offer.  This include taking classes in warlock, killing an NPC and so in.  Anything happening in real time should be told to the player via a hidden note (or a text in this day and age).  2) Continue to use the sword but not receive any magic benefit (or maybe even a small penalty) continuing to be berated and yelled at by the sword (ago via note.  If you want to be really harsh or force them to step 3 faster could even make them make a will save at night to avoid a level of exhaustion from no rest.  be careful and cap this at exhaustion level 3-4 or so).  Which leads to 3) going on some sort of quest to get rid of the sword.  because it's cursed they cant just drop the sword or it comes back; instead they need to magically get rid of it somehow.  Maybe this involves finding and/or helping a high level caster or maybe finding a very willing and worthy person to simply hand the sword off to (who's first order might be to kill the PC who gave them the sword).  In the end it's important that everyone (including you) at the table have fun with is."
dndnext,3diix8,LittleBillHardwood,0,Thu Jul 16 15:48:57 2015 UTC,"I did it. I made the players all roll up non-magic user characters. As the Prologue to the campaign, we did a one-session round-robin solo play at L1, where they each ended up detected as having magical potential and inducted into the ""we control all magic"" temple. Then I made them multiclass into at least one level of a magic class and whatever else they wanted to do to reach L5 where I'm actually starting the meat of the campaign. It's all part of the plot, they knew it was coming if they read between the lines of my character building writeup.

dndnext,3diix8,LittleBillHardwood,2,Thu Jul 16 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"Anything that didn't have spellcasting abilities at L1 was acceptable for the starting build.

dndnext,3djpkz,kekkres,4,Thu Jul 16 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/OrkishBlade that this should just be a Battle Master with the Inspiring Leader & Healer feats.  If you play a human, you'll be where you want in 4 levels. As it stands, the Warlord class is frontloading a lot of the Lv 3 Battle Master stuff to Lv 1."
dndnext,3djpkz,Thuxle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"Like i said i simply dont think the battlemaster does a good job as a warlord, it is, at best, lip service to some warlord abilities, and at the end of the day your trying to shove a support roll onto a damage class, and it will come off as half hearted no matter what build you go for. At least in my opinion."
dndnext,3djpkz,solife,3,Thu Jul 16 21:15:35 2015 UTC,"Add new maneuvers to Battlemaster then, or roll a Bard(valor)/Fighter(Battlemaster), or even just a Bard(valor), take the maneuver feat, and reflavor the music as shouts/commands and call it a Warlord. Based on the abilities you've listed, the warlord feels like a weird amalgamation between those 2.  Adjusting a subclass (or outright creating a new one) is also a lot easier to balance mechanically compared to creating a new class."
dndnext,3djpkz,OrkishBlade,2,Thu Jul 16 21:24:21 2015 UTC,"Given that you can build a Battle Master fighter that is practically a warlord if you select the right maneuvers: commander's strike, maneuvering attack, rally. Why not just tweak that subclass if it's not offering what you'd like to see? If you made these changes:   replace the Student of War feature with something healing related (healer's kit proficiency, training in Medicine, or maybe [but it might be overpowering] a re-flavored version of Preserve Life channel divinity option). come up with a few additional maneuvers focused on bolstering allies, shifting them around, or granting them attacks.   Then you'd effectively have a warlord without the potential for pitfalls and unbalancing that the whole new class could introduce."

Why not just tweak that subclass if it's not offering what you'd like to see? If you made these changes:   A lot of people are simply not happy with battle master as a warlord, which i understand to an extent. the battlemaster is at its base still a DPS focused class, something the warlord never really was, whats more now that the bard is full casting focused, I feel that there is plenty of room for a leader/group support character.  also I feel like building up new classes and trying to make them solid, even if you don't plan to give them much use is good practice for general design, and can help in other areas as well."
dndnext,3djpkz,OrkishBlade,2,Thu Jul 16 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"As an exercise, building new material is always good for learning the mechanics. ;-) ...but I still think the battle master is close to what you want.  If a player really wanted some of the warlord stuff at level 1, I might houserule, that he/she could gain Combat Superiority with only two maneuvers and two superiority die at level 1, and delay picking up Second Wind and remaining Combat Superiority goodies until level 3. (Something like that.)  I've been thinking about this for a number of subclasses recently ... assassin, beast master, where significant flavor for the character that wants to pursue those subclasses doesn't show up until level 2 or 3. When I have a little time, I'm going to write up a list of variants along these lines, where a PC can delay a level 1 feature for a nerfed version of the subclass's beginning features."
dndnext,3djpkz,OrkishBlade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:43:28 2015 UTC,"shrugs i will honestly likely do conversions of all the classes that interest me even if their are fairly close analogues (dragon shaman is my next project once i finish this). Its not the wait that bothers me, its that at the end of the day you have to scrounge around for those support abilities, and take in feats to get something that looks half right, and i would prefer to try and create a smoother more elegant package even if its a ton more work on my end."

dndnext,3djpkz,OrkishBlade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:25:39 2015 UTC,"Thoughts on new maneuvers (with modification of current maneuvers to grant benefit to allies):  Tactical Withdrawal. Similar to Evasive Footwork, but usable as reaction on ally within 30 ft.  Harrying Maneuver. Similar to Feinting Attack, but choose ally within 30 ft. to gain advantage instead of you.  Combined Attack. Similar to Riposte, but choose ally who can reach enemy to make melee attack as reaction.  Plus, mixing in a few of the more personal-combat-oriented maneuvers would help set your warlord's style apart from others... a brash warlord might use Menacing Attack and Goading Attack, an archer warlord might use Precision Attack, etc. along with the bolstering maneuvers.  Protection is a good Fighting Style option for a shield-wielding warlord. But I might even homebrew another option:  Lead the Attack. When you hit an enemy with a weapon attack, the next ally to hit that enemy with a melee weapon attack before the start of your next turn gains a +2 bonus to the damage roll."
dndnext,3djpkz,OrkishBlade,2,Thu Jul 16 21:37:56 2015 UTC,"So overall this class seems pretty balanced so far, although it definitely needs some flavor abilities.  This would probably work pretty well without too many new things added (just more tactics and leadership abilities) although there is very much room for archtypes to add more on time.  Bolster Spirits is way off.  While Cha might be a fitting stat it makes them way too multi stat dependent (and is really, really good with a high Cha)  Keep in mind that temp hit points are much better than healing for a few reasons (they can be done in advance of the need and caster don;t need to make a concentration check for temp hp damage)  A much better (and honestly more fitting solution) would be to instead roll the spent die for that many hitpoints.  This is better than the lore bards ability to decrease damage by a die with an inspiration die (prof bonus isn't added for them) but they have more flexibility as well.  This class also needs some way to regain their war dice.  Because they have a larger pool (maybe averaging 50% larger than bards over time and starting with a fighters but soon slightly more than doubling it) they shouldn't be gaining all of them back on a short rest.  Over the coarse of a day (assuming the standard 2 short rest leading to 1 long rest) a lore bard gets 15 inspiriation dice/day at level 8 (assuming a max cha by then) while a fight gets 12/day.  Regenerating at some sort of pace like that would make sense.  I'm thinking somewhere between level 1-8ish they get the ability to gain back half their proficiency bonus (rounded up for once!) on a short or long rest.  At level 11 this gives them around 11 dice/day and 14/day at max level.  This feels a little better to me.  So looking through all of the other abilities and such this class strikes me as a fighter with bardic inspiration dice (and a bard's cutting words) or a spell-less valor bard with cutting words in heavy armor.  Now that's a fine thing, but isn't interesting yet.  As before you have room for archtypes to add really interesting things here.  Your real challenge will be creating new tactics and leadership abilities that really feel unique.  If you are able to remove the ones that word for word mimic what a bard or fighter can do that's great (although understandably these classes locked down a lot of the options).  One small thought is some sort of ability that specifically affects allies and enemies concentration checks.  I think expending war dice to do it seems balanced and would be unique.  One note about Harry though.  The purpose seems to be that your war die is used to subject when the enemy is offensively targeting an ally.  This is fine and good.  You have written in that it cane reduce an enemies saving throw against an enemy.  Enemies only make saves against abilities targeting them so affecting a save doesn't work with the other two things going on. Lowering an enemies save is a very, very significant thing and in my opinion this shouldn;t be possible for the warlord at all.  There's a reason why bards can't do it (and I can't think of any ability that does)."
dndnext,3djpkz,techiesgoboom,0,Thu Jul 16 21:27:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for offering suggestions beyond ""use another class,"" now then. i was thinking of a pair of archetypes, a tactics focused ""general"" and a leadership focused ""commander"", but atm im still not sure how to implement them. I'm not sure what to do with bolster spirit, what is currently there was just a first attempt, i would still prefer temp hp over raw healing, though i agree a set duration is important, and the amount provided might be a bit much, perhaps just equivalent to your level? I actually forgot to include war dice recovery, my original plan was for full recovery on a long rest, and recovering up to half full on a short rest, although your method looks a bit better. As for flavor i agree a lot of work needs to be done, i was sorely tempted to add mount based abilities for a mounted knight or cavalier feel but sadly horses don't work in a great many campaigns.and formation based tactics, while cool and unique are..... iffy in theater of the mind style play. a ""grit your teeth"" ability to bypass a concentration check would be cool i agree. The issue with harry is a mistake, likely do to a bit of thoughtless typing and its similarities with inspire."

Con +3 means you only need to roll a 7 or higher, meaning a 70% chance of success.  But what about getting hit more than once?  If you get hit twice, the chance of success drops to 49%.  Three times?  34%  Four times?  24%  And that's with only a DC10, which is triggered even off 1 point of damage.  So it doesn't take much to drop concentration if the mobs focus fire, even if the actual damage being dealt is miniscule (e.g., kobolds).   War Caster and/or Resilient:Con help bolster those chances, but lots of low level mobs can still be brutal on concentration checks."

The way I read this, any damage dice attached (delivered as Crawford put it) to an attack are also rerolled when the attack crits. The fact that there is still a save DC means that the creature still has the option to resist the poison.

I think that even though it is a part of an attack his phrasing was to make a general rule that any damage that happens as a result of an attack vs. AC automatically is rolled twice (Sneak attack, smite, superiority) but any that rely on a save do not. I feel like this is true even if the save follows a strike."
dndnext,3dj6g5,Isord,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:03:42 2015 UTC,The damage is happening regardless.  The saving throw just halves it.
dndnext,3dj6g5,Isord,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:20:58 2015 UTC,"The saving throw is still paired with the poison. It's a separate attack that is allowed by making a hit with a weapon.  It's no different than being in range to make an acid splash attack. The D20 attack roll with a poisoned weapon places the poison in such a way as to force the creature to make a saving throw. Just like a fork delivering poisoned food is forcing the target to make a saving throw, just coincidentally the weapon has its own damage as well.  This is reinforced by creatures that deliver piercing and poison damage off of one attack roll rather than via saving throw."
dndnext,3dj6g5,LKDlk,-1,Fri Jul 17 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"It's that word ""delivered"" that is important. If a poison is delivered by an attack as Injury poisons require, then they are a part of that attack and get double rolled on a crit. The save portion signifies if the creature can resist the poison once it's already in its body. Sort of like a roll dependant form of resistance that's available to everyone."
dndnext,3dj6g5,Isord,4,Thu Jul 16 19:09:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, the tweet itself:   Any damage dice delivered by a critical hit—as opposed to a saving throw—are rolled twice.    So to make sure people understand it:   The poison is not delivered by the hit. The poison only applies when the player fails a saving throw. Tweet clearly says that ""as opposed to a saving throw"".   The question: Does the damage come after a saving throw or not? If yes: No double dice!"
dndnext,3dj6g5,LKDlk,0,Thu Jul 16 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"That poison deals damage (is applied) to the player regardless of the save, so it is delivered by the attack. The saving throw just reduces it's effect. That's different than a poison delivered through the air in an AoE like an inhaled poison."
dndnext,3dj6g5,Intuentis,2,Fri Jul 17 00:30:10 2015 UTC,"The poison is still delivered by a saving throw, it doesn't matter that a failure would still deal some damage.  Steps for dealing damage:   Attack roll. Apply damage dice, adding additional Sneak Attack, etc. All of this can crit. Roll the Saving Throw for an additional effect. Deal the poison damage. This can not crit.   He has made several tweets about it, nothing about this tweet changes anything about those."
dndnext,3dj6g5,Intuentis,0,Fri Jul 17 00:35:35 2015 UTC,I think it makes more sense to resolve all damage simultaneously for an attack. That swaps 2 and 3...and combines the new 3 with 4. That's regardless of the way poison damage is handled. The save would reduce the damage that's added to the amount resolved.
dndnext,3dj6g5,Intuentis,2,Fri Jul 17 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think anybody has said what makes more sense, only what is RAW. It's entirely possible that doubling damage dice on a crit failed saving throw is balanced, its just not in the rules."
dndnext,3dj6g5,Intuentis,0,Fri Jul 17 04:18:05 2015 UTC,I agree. Crit fails only exist on attacks as an auto-miss mechanic by RAW. I'm saying that an injury poison delivered on a crit attack should crit independently of the saving throw that reduces it's damage effect.
dndnext,3dj6g5,Intuentis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:17:53 2015 UTC,"I think you are getting hung up on the fact that the saving throw is for half damage. The majority of damage saving throws are for half damage. The only difference between fireball and a poison sting from a snake is that the sting requires an attack roll to set up. The damage that follows the saving throw is still calculated. The attack roll is just a complicated somatic component.  A poison can't act until it gets inside you somehow. The weapon attack allows it to get inside you, but the saving throw determines damage. Hence, the poison can't crit."
dndnext,3dj6g5,moonshadowkati,0,Fri Jul 17 12:51:50 2015 UTC,"I know I get stuck on the attack component, but that's because I see it as fundamentally different and important. A Fireball doesn't attack a creature, instead it effects an area that creature is in and the DEX save signifies the creature's ability to dodge or hide from the effect somehow. However, Injury poisons are unique. They require an attack roll to do anything, yet have a saving throw that halves their effect. I can't find anything else that requires both. To me, it makes sense (and seems simplest) to let and damage dice get double rolled on a critical attack (injury poisons, divine smites, etc). If something has no attack roll at all (Fireball, AoE poisons, etc), then it can't crit.  Logically (and forget rules for this bit), it makes more sense for a poison applied directly to an organ like the heart or liver to be twice as effective than the radiant damage from a divine smite or the necrotic damage from Hex. They're secondary magical damage (and in the case of Hex not even applied by an attack) triggered by a successful attack."
dndnext,3dj6g5,Intuentis,2,Fri Jul 17 13:32:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing about balance or sense here. It doesn't seem terribly unbalanced to me for poisons applied by a weapon to crit. I'm just arguing about RAW.  To your earlier point of weapon poisons, the weapon and the poison are two different things still. A poison is applied on a hit but the hit is not the cause of the poison, the poison is. The weapon hit is just providing a scenario in which the poison can act.   You could imagine someone getting cut by a knife, and then later you rub poison in the wound. It's no different than the poison taking effect right after the hit except for the timing. But that makes clear why the two are separate things entirely.  Again, I'm not arguing sense or balance, just RAW. Jeremy Crawford has made it clear with multiple tweets what was meant, and honestly the book is pretty clear to begin with. Damage from saving throws never crit."
dndnext,3dj6g5,moonshadowkati,0,Fri Jul 17 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"Technically, there is no rule that says that damage from saving throws can't crit, only that an attack roll is required for a crit. It's just that injury poisons are the only things that have both a saving throw and an attack.  Your split source example should apply to Hex and Divine Smite damage as well, since they are also from a separate source, yet it doesn't. Their lack of a saving throw doesn't change that. For instance, a Cleric's Divine Stike specifically notes that it imbues the weapon with bonus damage, so it is intrinsically tied to the weapon and its attack.  Smearing a poison into an open wound would make it a Contact Poison, not Injury.   DMG p. 257 Contact. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects. Injury. A creature that takes slashing or piercing damage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated with injury poison is exposed to its effects.   Edit: formatting"
dndnext,3dj6g5,Intuentis,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:57:18 2015 UTC,"The poison is delivered by the hit, it is clearly an effect of the hit.  If you are not hit, you do not have to save.  The poison damage is ""additional damage dice"" that, by the critical hit rules, is doubled.  It is completely irrelevant if you get a save for the damage or not because nowhere in the saving throw rules does it say anything about overriding the critical hit rules.

Arcane  Archer  Prerequisite:  The  ability  to  cast  at  least  one  spell of  1st  level  or  higher,  proficiency  with  the  long bow  or  short  bow   As  an  action,  you  can  imbue  a  spell  of  1st  level  or higher  into  an  arrow  you  are  holding.  You  cast the  spell  as  normal,  but  the  spell  effect  does  not occur  until  after  the  arrow  is  used  in  an  attack.  You  can  only  imbue  a  spell  that  affects  one creature  or  a  spell  that  has  an  area  such  as  a sphere,  cloud,  or  cylinder.  The  arrow  holds  the spell  effect  until  the  end  of  your  next  long  rest  or until  it  is  used  in  an  attack  that  hits.  If  you  cast  a  spell  that  affects  one  creature,  the next  time  the  imbued  arrow  hits  a  creature  with an  attack,  the  attack  deals  damage  as  normal, and  then  you  resolve  the  spell’s  effect  against  the target.   If  you  imbued  a  spell  that  has  an  area,  the creature  does  not  need  to  be  hit  for  the  spell  to take  effect.  Instead,  you resolve  the  spell’s  effect from  the  space  or  creature  you  targeted.  If  the arrow  hits  a  creature,  damage  is  dealt  as  normal.

dndnext,3ddzno,noknam,3,Wed Jul 15 18:48:26 2015 UTC,"That could be true. But it could lead to interesting RP. I might suggest befriending a bard, or some other character with good language skills, and take 'language lessons' if you will. This would be a good in game logic for having a fairly wide collection of useable words and phrases. I'd personally still speak a little stilted and odd if I was playing the race for flavor reasons, but that's just me"
dndnext,3ddzno,alphaofdeath,3,Wed Jul 15 19:07:34 2015 UTC,The ambusher feat is too strong and too situational at the same time.  They'd be a nearly mandatory race for rogues while pretty useless for other classes. Try to keep your races as class neutral as possible.
dndnext,3ddzno,t0beyeus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:53:37 2015 UTC,"Kenku has been one of my favorite races over the editions so I was very happy to see this.   I am in agreement with the other people on here that the ambusher feature is a very niche feature and overall too strong for those niche characters. Have you considered ditching this feature and replacing it with the much more common kenku feature ""flock effect"". I'm not entirely sure how it would be implemented but it plays better with the idea of kenku better than ambushing does.  I also think that the way you went about mimicry is rather awkward as it has never been described as a magical effect(to my knowledge, I could be wrong). Look to how changlings were handled by Wizards for inspiration here.  Overall very neat, and thought provoking post."
dndnext,3ddzno,alphaofdeath,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:10:20 2015 UTC,"I have no knowledge of the flock effect unfortunately. I can look into. I do post this stuff here to make them living documents, and adjust after getting input, so thank you on that score.  I'm honestly surprised that Ambush is seen as OP. I had four thoughts here. A player will have to work to make it go off at all. At best, it should only work once a fight, then no one is surprised after, which seemed in line with Half-Orc bonus crit damage in that a 20 isn't going to be rolled every second or third attack, so I thought Ambush was balanced enough. Advantage maths out to a plus 5 on average, and that didn't feel game breaking, or no more so than Halflings never rolling a one or the ability to take the Help action and hand Advantage to a friend.  Mimicry/Prestidigitation. Agreed, it's just a racial thing. Mentioned above that I liked it also giving the ability to make illusory objects which is in line with their penchant to hand out fake gifts/treasure in the lore. How about this? Mimicry is just an action. Prestidigitation free, once per long rest, intended but not made mandatory, for use in creating these fake treasures? I'll look forward to opinions on this, but I already feel like that's the smarter way to do it to achieve the flavor goal I was after instead of bending Mimicry in a way that served multiple purposes.  Thanks for looking at this and pitching in ideas!"
dndnext,3ddzno,t0beyeus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:54:40 2015 UTC,Is the Flock effect similar to the wolves' Pack Tactics? Advantage on attack rolls vs enemies that are engaged by an ally?  That would be very cool and good for all classes.
dndnext,3ddzno,t0beyeus,0,Wed Jul 15 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"I feel like the niche part of ambusher was were I had a problem part with it. Only rouges, rangers and maybe fighters could make good use out of that.  I definitely agree that the ability to give out fake items is a very unique and interesting aspect of kenku. What if they were able to use their forgery kit on more than handwriting, it extends to items as well. If you did this I would definitely switch them to having proficiency with sleight of hand though.  Flock effect in other editions usually makes kenku have a better aid or help action than other classes. Perhaps in 5e you could make it so that kenku can use help during combat from farther than 5 feet away or something to that effect."
dndnext,3ddzno,Dungeon___Master,3,Wed Jul 15 21:07:24 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't any class making an attack roll benefit from Ambush? Why not a cleric, or sorcerer etc.? I'm not sure I understand"
dndnext,3ddzno,jerwex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:40:00 2015 UTC,"I have made an adjustment to the Mimicry feature. As suggested here, it now remains a simple action, instead of the function of an innate ability to cast Prestidigitation. Instead, to reflect to lore about kenku often offering false gifts that quickly crumble, they now have a once/long rest ability to cast Prestidigitation. This feels more balanced and true to the race. Thanks you to every one who pointed that out and offered suggestions"
dndnext,3ddzno,jerwex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"Seems a bit unfair that they get a cantrip that can only be used once a day compared to every other racial cantrip.  If they got Proficiency with Sleight of Hand and Forgery Tools they could in essence create fake bills, paperwork etc. and still swap it or steal it. I think that still fits the idea of crumbling items."
dndnext,3ddy7r,majinace,12,Wed Jul 15 14:56:08 2015 UTC,"I recently let my party of 5 lvl 5s fight an ancient red dragon alongside an entire city of Dwarves. It was incredibly tense and hilariously fun, Dwarves were flying left and right screaming dwarvish curses at the dragon as it razed their city to the ground. After many districts of High Horn being destroyed, and many ballista shots later they drove off the dragon to give the city some reprieve so they could all flee to safety.   We spent about a session prior building up the city, I love doing a really gruff and hardy Scottish accent for Dwarves that are ready for a bit of a rough and tumble. So it was a rather fun time for all of us."

A Roc's natural hunting habit is to fly incredibly high and drop it's food. Lucky for the grappled guy he had a feather fall ring. He got off a shot while falling but was regrabbed and this time promptly swallowed. So here he is with his 10 in Str trying to cut his way out with a dagger, when he actually kills the bird without breaking out of its stomach, causing the bird to fly straight into the ground. I quickly check the rules and he has one more turn to escape before being flattened inside the bird, since his feather fall ring won't help being inside the Roc. He succeeds at cutting himself and floats down as the giant bird crashes to the ground next to him. All the while another player had ""Danger Zone"" playing from his phone."

In the first room they had to stay in the shadows of revolving fans, pick up a key, then unlock the door. The first creature in the Dungeon would attack any player caught in the light.  Next was your standard mirror and lights puzzle.  Then there was a trapped corridor, rolling boulder action, slamming pillars, fireballs, poison darts. Inspired by this picture from 4th edition:  http://mirpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/dnd5.jpg  Next was a room where they where split into four and had to get a key from one side of the room to the other without waking the dragon, this was done by passing it along threads stretched across pits.  And finally they had to put all their skills together to reveal and pass through a noise sensitive door, one of the hero's lost a leg at this part.  It was great!"

It was my second ever session and we were doing a one shot dungeon run, right before it we were allowed to stock up on supplies in town, and I went on a crime spree with my rogue stealing everything I could. Inluding a glass mirror, which my DM says to this day he only gave me because he figures if he gave me something semi valuable i would stop searching.  About 3 hours later we are fighting a basilisk, my entire party save me are petrified and I'm out of crossbow bolts and dropped my dagger. I pull out the mirror with one of those epihony type moments and use it to turn the petrification back on the basilisk.   The moral of thus story is let your players do the crazy things. It encourages them to roleplay and think outside the box which in turn makes you work harder to give them excellent chances to do these things increasing the fun for everyone."
dndnext,3ddy7r,Sgt_Slacker,2,Wed Jul 15 16:24:32 2015 UTC,"There's a tie and these are the very short versions of these stories from a campaign a year ago.   1) Party sails their boat to a sunken library to find it surrounded by a lizardfolk navy. Giant man o war has captains with bounties on their heads so they decide to throw caution to the wind and sack the ship. In an AMAZING battle with classic piratey on deck swordsmanship and rope swinging and deception to get their ship closer, and a wizard and barbarian sneaking along the side of the boat to crash through the glass at an unsuspecting captain, a druid breathing underwater to cut a hole in the ship and light the munitions on fire, it was the greatest action set piece I've ever made.   2) Party has choice between slaying orc shaman snake creepy lady or going after the hydra she's controlling. She's hiding on an island, hydra is attacking the city. They go after her. They get to the city and the hydra is dead, defeated by a man standing victoriously on one of its heads. They are then arrested by the police. Witnesses saw them sailing to the island where the Hydra came from, and the investigators claim that they were in control of the hydra. They then had to use a week to mount a legal defense and prove they didn't do it. Sounds boring, but I could tell my players had never had to do anything like this in a game before and they ran with it. Everyone split up and did their own legs of mounting the defense. One ghost,  a guild war, a corrupt wizard, a secret plot, and a weaving into the overall campaign arc later, they'd defended themselves in court, convinced the city that they had bigger problems (bad guys had been incubating a kraken egg underneath the city) and then killed said kraken, preventing more city destruction."
dndnext,3ddy7r,TheJamesWrites,2,Wed Jul 15 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"We decided our party, ""The Dragon Slayers"", would take on a CR 23 Ancient green dragon at level 12. Thing should've nuked us, but between our druid's first round reaction wind wall, my second round otto's dance, and third round hex (strength) and bigby's hand grapple, the dragon got carved into mincemeat. I got to land a final blow in the form of a 5th level scorching ray which hit 6 times with a critical, flying in the air 25' away from the dragon's head. Awesome visual battle, and an incredible combination of party tactics to survive an over-the-top foe. It went all out after me too, using all of its legendary attacks on me or to get to me, dropped me to 10% health before we dropped it."
dndnext,3ddy7r,MixmasterWizbang,2,Wed Jul 15 20:10:56 2015 UTC,"I have 2 things that I really enjoyed DMing for, and, while a bit random, they make for pretty great stories, and were lots of fun for the players, I'll describe them:  The Cloak Hanger  So, for some reason, my party was on a city floating in the sky, and they needed to retrieve this cloak that was requested by the archmage who ran the city. Seems simple enough, but the kicker was that the Cloak gave 5 at-will teleportations up to 1 KM per day, and increased Intelligence by +6 (it was meant to be for the archmage and such).  Anyway, at some point they found out that the cloak was actually at the bottom of the city, that is, on the underside of this giant floating city. So the question became, how did to get it (and how did it get there), but, eventually, they found a secret path that led down to this manhole cover, and when they opened it, they see this big L-shaped beam that is about 30-feet on each side, and attached to the underside of the city.   Wouldn't you know it, at the end was the cloak, totally safe right?  The beam was not attached right near the manhole, so they needed to somehow get to the beam, climb/slide/crawl down 30 feet, where it abruptly turned at a 90 degree angle, and then had to walk/crawl down the beam as it got narrower to a near pinpoint. It ended up being a lot of fun, as the challenge wasn't that hard, but the penalty was a 2-3 KM fall down to earth, and presumably, death. If they could get the cloak, even if they fell, they could teleport to save themselves; my whole party was level 1-3, so no fly spells, so if someone fell, the solution would be to quickly get the cloak and teleport to save them.  On the whole, it was one of the most memorable challenges that I gave, as it was simple, but challenging.  The Pillow Stick  This one is just silly. Basically, some players were being extorted by Asmodeus to destroy this city of Small-sized races that were living in this giant tree that was 80+ stories, and was about 1KM diameter. To be fair, the justification he gave was that they were being little pricks (and they were).  In any case, what makes that memorable is this weapon that he gave them. It looked like a plain grey baseball/softball bat, and had almost no weight; when something was hit by it, it seemed like nothing happened. Until a few seconds later (time based on the mass of what was hit, if something was too big, i.e. the ground, just a large area was affected), when the thing was accelerated to around 200 m/s, which would frequently liquefy whatever was hit, especially people.  Overpowered, but there were some interesting ways that this influenced puzzle solving, as I would provide lots of things that the players would want to smack, but if they did, might solve the problem while making it dangerous/bad for them."
dndnext,3ddy7r,AFuryOfOwls,2,Wed Jul 15 20:54:18 2015 UTC,"Back in 3.0 the ""best"" (meaning the shittiest and cheesiest) way to kill a dragon was for the party's arcane caster to turn it into a whale of the appropriate size, then have the rest of the group hack the helpless thing to death.  Obviously my players exploited the shit out of this option.  My response was the Spine Dragon, from (IIRC) Monsters of Faerun.  It had precisely one spell like ability: spell reflection.  The look on my friend's face when he found his character had been transformed into a narwhal was goddamn priceless.  Icing on the cake was a twenty minute argument between two players as to whether whale song constitutes a language for the purposes of verbal components.  Then one of the party members had to hold his spellbook up to his giant whale eye so he could memorize it.    Good times."

These wizards all acted on the same initiative, and never moved independently of one another.  And always spoke in unison.  I more or less gave them at will dimension door and all 4 teleported in sync with one another as their move.  I also let them cast 2 spells per round.  It's kinda hard to equate this to D&D since I did this in Savage Worlds, but I basically winged the whole encounter.  I gave them some rough stats (HP, AC) and had them casting a beefy Eldritch Bolt style spell.  (They were partially inspired by Wizzrobes from Zelda.)  Anyways, once the wizards were dispatched, the statue in the center of the courtyard exploded and a powerful vampire walked out.  I played this part out in a cinematic fashion.  One of our players was out for the semester, so the vampire reached out his hand and levitated his PC.  PC started writhing in pain and screaming and the party attacked the vampire but couldn't do any damage.  After 1 round the PC that the vampire was going all Darth Vader on got pulled quickly towards him and ""faster than they could see it happen"" his claw was in the PCs chest.

dndnext,3dfcgk,Th3Dux,4,Wed Jul 15 20:49:42 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you think fits more with the character. Taking the extra two wizard levels will get you an additional spell slot for Arcane Recovery and multiple recoveries with Expert Divination. Putting those two levels into Cleric will get you an extra Ability Score Increase (or a feat if your DM allows it). Of those two options it's really up to you to decide which is more useful/flavorful.  Another thing to keep in mind though, is how high of a level do you see yourself getting to? I forget what the statistic is, but very few groups ever actually see play to and at level 20. It might be best to pick what looks more appealing in the short-term."

dndnext,3ddyiy,Vilis16,4,Wed Jul 15 14:58:28 2015 UTC,I generally use a grid so squares are either in the area or not; I'm pretty sure there's notes in the players handbook to fit areas on the grid.  Otherwise I would go with a simple if more than half the creatures body is in the area it effects them.

dndnext,3ddyiy,techiesgoboom,3,Wed Jul 15 16:48:16 2015 UTC,"The PHB dictates that the cone's base and height be equal. In this case, a 3 square tall cone should be 3 squares wide. Can you direct me to a part of the book that says otherwise?"
dndnext,3ddyiy,WeylandTheDwarf,3,Wed Jul 15 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"No. You are correct. PHB pg. 204 On squares, I would rule:     XXX XXX NXN NCN   X being the affected squares, C being the caster, N being no effect. I have started using Hexes, though. It works better with Are of Effects attack, and imo, it looks more realistic in Melee situations."
dndnext,3ddyiy,Vawned,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:10:56 2015 UTC,How about for a 4 tall cone? And so on? I've looked before and it seemed rather bizzare.  I saw one resource that showed below for a 5 tall cone:  XXXXX  NXXXX  NXXXN  NNXXN  NNXNN  NNCNN  It seems to me the player would then get to choose to reflect it to be:  XXXXX  XXXXN  NXXXN  NXXNN  NNXNN  NNCNN  Deciding which configuration does damage and referring to the chart seems silly at best. I've thought about something like below:  XXXXX  RXXXR  NXXXN  NRXRN  NNXNN  NNCNN  The main difference is that the R represents a spot that the player rolls a d20 to see if the square is effected with an 11+ being a success. They'd only need to roll for squares that are occupied. My problem is I can't think of a better way to handle this quickly.
dndnext,3ddyiy,WeylandTheDwarf,2,Wed Jul 15 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"I would rule:   XXXXX NXXXN NXXXN NNXNN NNXNN NNCNN   With a cone that huge I assume you need to sacrifice precision close to you (less squares at 10ft. of you) to better widen and length the cone. As seen here  The DMG could've handled AoE spells on grid. There is literally nothing regarding it in the book.  edit_ You could, in your R make the spell hit, but for Half damage, and 1/4 on a successful save. If it is a saving throw, give advantage maybe? On a Hex, out of curiosity"
dndnext,3ddyiy,Vawned,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:39:31 2015 UTC,That is a very good point. I suppose similar reasoning could be used for all odd-length cones. I'm a bit less certain with even-length cones. I'm also hoping to come up with a clear solution for circles as well.
dndnext,3ddyiy,WeylandTheDwarf,2,Wed Jul 15 17:55:07 2015 UTC,"I've edited the parent. Check it. Regarding circles, what is your problem? I'm with photoshop open, let's work that out."
dndnext,3ddyiy,Vawned,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"First off, I really like your idea of involving advantage/disadvantage. I could simply make all of the R spaces at disadvantage for the attacker or advantage for the dodger. For circles, the problem is the standard ""round shape on a square grid"" issue. I'm thinking I'll probably just get a coat hanger and bend a Minecraft square-circle pattern for sizes I need. It won't be perfect, but should work well enough."
dndnext,3ddyiy,WeylandTheDwarf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:01:49 2015 UTC,I think R should be represented in game by giving advantage on the dex saving throw because he's not in the full blast so he would have a much easier time dodging
dndnext,3ddyiy,Nukeliod,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:56:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, I have read and now understand the issue.  I was thinking cones were wider than they actually are.  The solution for pathfinder was 1-3-3 (rather than the 1-5-5 I proposed).  This seems like a simple and clean solution.  It's still not perfect but it errors on the side of maybe hitting an extra person or two."
dndnext,3ddyiy,techiesgoboom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:11:52 2015 UTC,"That is what Vawned recommended as well, but I don't think it works well for larger cones. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on my post with my proposed solution. My concern is that it might be overly clunky."
dndnext,3ddyiy,WeylandTheDwarf,2,Wed Jul 15 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"honestly I'm not a big fan of the asymmetry but that's just me.  I'm pretty sure that's the 4e solution which was built around a grid and standardized play so it's likely the best way to implement it easily and quickly.  Alternatively I've seen another group that actually had some cutouts.  I'm pretty sure they were shaped (pipecleaners or something similar) and were accurate representations of the cone's shape (as in actually 3 cubes exactly wide and front to back and so on)  You center the casting on any edge of the square you are in (or maybe the center, I'd need to physically try it out to see what works best) and point it in any direction you want.  If at least half of a cube is inside the edges then it hits, if not it misses.  It requires a little DM judgement on ""half"" but it might be a good solution as well.  Luckily spells only come in a few different sized cones so it's not like you would need a lot of resources."
dndnext,3ddyiy,techiesgoboom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:48:27 2015 UTC,I definitely agree on disliking asymmetry. I like the idea of cutouts. I think I'll end up making some especially for spherical spells.
dndnext,3ddyiy,WeylandTheDwarf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:58:17 2015 UTC,Alternatively I've seen another group that actually had some cutouts.   This was going to be my suggestion.  Easy enough for casters to prepare for the common spells that have fixed AoEs.
dndnext,3ddyiy,dethpot8o,3,Wed Jul 15 18:28:51 2015 UTC,Only partially. There are a couple spells that specifically say the target needs to be fully in the area.

dndnext,3ddyiy,MoebiusSpark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:19:53 2015 UTC,If you have to be fully engulfed by the effect then the spells with 10 foot cube range self would be useless.  On the other hand it is obvious that turning a 5ft cube effct 45 degrees should not let it hit 5 squares.  It does indeed become difficult with cone spells. I'd say go for  1-3-3 on 15ft cones.
dndnext,3ddyiy,noknam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"For things like fire and so forth, I say it has to intersect anywhere with the 5' x 5' x height' cube around a potential target.  I could see an argument for using a cylinder too.  However, for mind affecting spells like sleep - I rule that the centre of the tile (the head) must be touched.  Otherwise that feels a bit weird to me."
dndnext,3ddyiy,vampatori,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:22 2015 UTC,"I am almost certain that D&D 5e does not count areas of effect using squares in the same way that Pathfinder or 4e do. For example in Pathfinder a 15-foot cone would effect 1 square, then 3 squares across and then 3 squares across again beyond that. D&D 5e is literally a 15-foot smooth cone: draw a horizontal line that is 15-foot wide (3 squares) and that is 15-foot (3 squares) away from the spell's point of origin, then draw 2 straight lines from the point of origin to each end of the 15-foot (3 squares) horizontal line you drew earlier to create an actual cone. If a square is at least 50% engulfed by the area of effect then that whole square is effected.  Likewise a sphere area of effect is not an odd, 'pixelated' looking circle on the grid because it has to awkwardly work in squares. It is literally a smooth, perfect circle.  As far as I know this is always how D&D 5e has worked."

dndnext,3dcxf0,Heyo_Azo,4,Thu Jul 16 14:17:23 2015 UTC,"I LOVE having completely new groups.  My FLGS has an ""Encounters"" night on Wednesday. It's basically me and 1-2 other DMs all running tables at the same time.  The groups are pretty fluid and at this point all the settings are homebrew (none of us liked HotDQ enough to keep running it after the party left Greenest).  One day I come in about a half hour early and there's this 16 y/o kid sitting at the table with a PHB.  I do the whole ""Hey, welcome to the group. Are you new to D&D?"" shtick.  Turns out he is new, and so are the 5 other people he's bringing with him. I ended up with two 16 yo guys (Fighter, Wizard), a 15 yo girlfriend (Druid), a 12 yo little brother (Rogue), one of the guy's mom (another Druid) and the other guy's dad (another Fighter).  We did a 2hr character creation/basic rules session followed by a bar fight.  Putting the players in the setting and saying ""What would you like to do?"" and seeing them realize that they get to make the whole thing up, there are no yellow exclamation points above people's heads, there are no dialogue options to choose, there are no ""Press X"" instructions is super exciting.  It really made my night, when the first person to speak up was the 12 yo.  He looks at me and says ""Can I steal things from the people at the bar?"" and I knew a fresh Murder Hobo had been born.  I best part is that I have hit the exact right age gap between the parents and kids.  None of them has played Ocarina of Time, so that's what they're doing now.  They just got out of the Deku tree and are about to head off to Hyrule Castle.  The sessions are a ton of fun for me as a DM, because instead of having veteran players basing their decisions on mechanics, optimizing their action economy and trying to exploit weird RAW combos, I get someone saying ""What's a Tinderbox?"", immediately followed by ""I want to set the spider's web on fire with my Tinderbox"".  Then I get to decide how that fits into the rules.  Anyway I love new groups because seeing them realize they can do pretty much anything they want is great."

The only way to get a pdf of the books is to, well, do unsavory things.  The PHB isn't too expensive and has everything a player will ever need. Just tell your friends to save up money and buy one. Until then they can use the basic rules. Or you can do their character sheets for them."
dndnext,3dg9ra,Dongaloid,2,Thu Jul 16 01:31:23 2015 UTC,"Technically, if you were to get Fantasy Grounds, you can get full copies of all the content in the PHB & MM (soon the DMG) for use in Fantasy Grounds, but you can't read them outside FG so I don't think that's the right reason to get them.  But for DMing online over FG it's amazing.  Every race, class, feat, item, and spell from the PHB, plus every monster (complete with token, portrait, and text) from the MM.  Both have reference windows too, where you can just read the book normally.  Anyway, after you buy the physical books I'm fairly confident a little Googling will find PDFs on the interwebz."

dndnext,3dg9ra,Dongaloid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"What do you mean they messaged you that you can't show it?

In fact, I made the tutorials for PAR5E, showing everyone how to make their own modules--which are a sticky on the FG forums.  I stream my game every Tuesday (like 19 sessions now) and put them on YouTube.  So I'm confused as to who was messaging you."

dndnext,3dg6vo,MTMFDiver,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:51 2015 UTC,"yes, on the monsters tab, above the ""new"" ""customize"" buttons, there are 3 buttons ""All types"" ""all CRs"" and ""all"" the third one you can select and pick ""custom"". This will show the 5e content and all the 5e monster have ""5e"" in their name.  For spells, there are similar buttons but this time you wanna pick the first button that says ""all"" and change it to ""custom"". All the spells have ""dnd"" in their name. This is because if you create a monster with spells there is a way to format it so that it links to the spells and if they had ""5e"" in their name then it confuses the program, so instead I changed it to have ""dnd"". The format for spell lists is kinda complicated and you'd have to look at pathfinder monsters to try to copy what was done with them. I'm not that familiar with it myself.  Hope that helps, let me know if you still can't filter it"

dndnext,3df6kf,sunbrick,8,Wed Jul 15 20:08:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly suggestion a million times over if for one simple reason -it works both inside and outside of combat.  That alone is a giant bonus.  Not to mention ""go home"" ""attack that other guy"" ""give me your weapons and armor"" would likely provide you much more benefit than you would gain from phantasmal force."

dndnext,3df6kf,tulsadan,6,Wed Jul 15 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"You should ask your DM his position on Suggestion.  It is very easy to gimp.  It has to be a reasonable suggestion, and a DM can simply decide that there are no reasonable suggestions - or at least make the range of believable suggestions extremely narrow.  Without some constraint, suggestion is more powerful for a PC with telepathy than the 4th level spell banishment.  And a lot of DMs feel the need to gimp Suggestion for balance.  As for phantasmal force, it is a very good spell.  It attacks Int, which is unusual, and not many creatures have a good Int.  The best use I have found in combat it to plant a facehugger (the Aliens critter) on the target so it cannot see or speak for a minute (or until you lose concentration, or it makes the Investigation check).  It isn't an encounter breaker like suggestion (or hold person), but it does definitely handicap a target.  Plus there are some other, out of combat things you can do with phantasmal force on occasion."

dndnext,3df0g0,Lord_of_Hydras,2,Fri Jul 17 00:41:54 2015 UTC,It doesn't balance out though.  Crippling (or insta-killing) a monster on a 20 is a temporary benefit.  You win a single fight more easily.  Getting crippled (or insta-killed) on a 1 messes your character up long term.  All future fights are effected.

dndnext,3df0g0,WizardoftheSea,3,Wed Jul 15 19:37:59 2015 UTC,The best race is the one that matches your backstory the best.   A half Orc would be really cool from the concept of hating his rampaging kin and making himself disciplined to control his own rage.   A tiefling could be embracing his demonic nature by becoming an elemental monk and focusing on fire and ripping his opponents apart with his bare hands.   A drow sees the utility in the shadows he will command as a shadow monk.   A dwarf was caught in a cave in as a child and the only thing that kept him sane till rescue was chanting the mantra he heard a traveling monk utter once (bonus points for a Dune reference here: fear is the mind killer).   These are just off the top of my head but you get the point.

I'm using the computer to randomly generate the loot, dungeons and random encounters. Most of my operation is behind the screen in the back right corner.   In the world of Harlonde, the Dragon population has been dwindling. Dragon scholar Raen Sai(divination wizard npc) has been instructed to gather a party to investigate. Raen has prophesied the return of an ancient Dragon, by the name Mersoth, who seeks to topple the thrones of the Dragon gods and become the one Dragon God.   This sends the party to the 5 chromatic Dragon lairs to obtain any items that have come in contact with the Dragon(a piece of its hoard, or a piece of the Dragon itself).   Once the collection has been completed, the Dragon scholars will be able to scry for the orb of dragonkind which when used, will beckon Mersoth out of hiding.   The party collects the orb only to find that it is a phylatery for the now dracolich ""Mersoth the immortal one"".

For reference, the campaign I was working on (writers block after a while) was a large island that's mostly desert with a strip of jungle on the western coast. The island used to be a tropical paradise.  The reason for its current state is a battle between ancient elves and a legendary red dragon Barroth. His flames were ""as intense as lava"" as old books would say and burned away most of the foliage during his genocide. They weren't able to kill him, but did devise a way to ""lock him away."" The elves fled the island after, having little to nothing left. Few of the inhabitants there now know of this, and even if they told the tale they'd be mocked. Dragons are a ""myth"" in this world.  When my players accidentally discover him and release him, it'll be a shock for sure. Not just that this thing appears, whether they know of the old tales or not, but that Dragons in this world aren't winged, four-legged, lizard-like beasts but actually massive wurms. There is evidence of this from craters left in the ground, the mouths of Barroths ancient tunnels sealed up over time. Some are actually used for certain purposes.

dndnext,3dfj1x,the_singular_anyone,0,Thu Jul 16 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"From the PHB:   When you choose this feat, you acquire a ritual book holding two 1st-level spells of your choice. Choose one of the following classes: bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. You must choose your spells from that class’s spell list, and the spells you choose must have the ritual tag.   It's referring only to the two first-level spells you are choosing (and the casting ability) when it limits them by class. Outside of that, you can copy whatever you like from any spell list into your ritual book."
dndnext,3dfj1x,Unwyrden,4,Wed Jul 15 21:48:20 2015 UTC,"You might want to keep reading...the Ritual Caster feat limits you to that class' spell list for any and all spells you have and can copy into it. This is especially frustrating because only wizard's really write down their spells and scrolls can be hard to find.   If you come across a spell in written form, such as a magical spell scroll or a wizard’s spellbook, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell must be on the spell list for the class you chose, the spell’s level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the ritual tag."

The best-case scenario with that is Wizard with access to half of the existing rituals, and that requires casting with INT, which no one except for Wizards (and classes that cast as wizards) does anyway.   Clerics and Druids overlap on half their spells, too, making being one and choosing the other for WIS casting a pretty poor choice.   And the poor Warlock gets its entire spell list eaten by the Bard except for contact other plane, while the Sorcerer is only a better choice than the Bard if you're going on water adventures.   What a truly poorly designed feat."
dndnext,3dfj1x,CureChihaysaur,4,Wed Jul 15 22:41:18 2015 UTC,"Ritual spells currently don't really have anything to do with stats and modifiers, so you can still dump INT and get huge mileage out of picking the wizard book as any other class."
dndnext,3dfj1x,the_singular_anyone,2,Wed Jul 15 23:08:28 2015 UTC,"Point. It's still weird that they make your spell casting hinge on a stat that's hard to have useful for your class.  Wizards really do have the best spells selected out of the rituals anyway, so there's little reason to choose anything else unless you have some pressing need to talk to animals and trees."
dndnext,3dfj1x,SirPeebles,2,Wed Jul 15 23:13:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on your character concept. It would make sense for a totem barbarian, ranger, or nature cleric to take Ritual Caster (Druid) for instance."
dndnext,3dfj1x,the_singular_anyone,2,Thu Jul 16 00:03:56 2015 UTC,"But all of those get Speak With Animals from other sources. Even the barbarian.   Again, it's not an invalid choice, just one that's obviously much lesser when compared with the wizard's spell list."

dndnext,3dfj1x,SirPeebles,2,Thu Jul 16 12:32:34 2015 UTC,I don't think it is poorly designed at all. You are just experiencing some disappointment in the wake of discovering that you've misread it.
dndnext,3dfj1x,the_singular_anyone,2,Wed Jul 15 23:38:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is poorly designed at all.   I was about to say ""Eh, either-or,"" but on second thought I'm actually going to stick to my guns here.  If you choose Sorcerer or Warlock, you get only a possible 4 spells you can ever learn as rituals from this feature, and you get two of them up front, meaning that there are only two spells in the entire game that you can ever find in the wild and learn from this feature.   Someone choosing a Wizard has fourteen spells they can find in the wild and learn, for comparison.   This makes 40% of the choices on this feat trap-choices, which is something that 5e's design philosophy has expressly been trying to avoid.   So, yeah. Poorly designed."
dndnext,3dfj1x,SirPeebles,2,Wed Jul 15 23:46:21 2015 UTC,"This isn't an issue with the feat though, but rather a quirk of the class spell lists. It is sort of like how the dragon sorcerer's elemental affinity feature is just fine itself, even for acid dragon; the problem is that the sorcerer's spell list has too few acid damage spells.  Edit: you could argue that warlock and sorcerer just shouldn't be options. Those classes do not have the ritual caster subfeature, so it makes sense that their lists have fewer rituals. But hey, better to allow the option than not in my opinion."
dndnext,3dfj1x,the_singular_anyone,3,Wed Jul 15 23:55:48 2015 UTC,"This isn't an issue with the feat though, but rather a quirk of the class spell lists.   But the feat uses the spell lists as a mechanic when it doesn't have to. There are other ways of breaking down the ritual lists that are more balanced.  For example, the feat could read like this:  Choose CHA, WIS, or INT. You use this for your casting stat for rituals that require one, and you may only learn rituals available to classes with a casting stat the same as yours.  This'd lump Bard, Sorcerer, and Warlock into one list with 15 spells, Druid and Cleric into one list with 18 spells, and Wizard into its own group with 16 spells. As a 1-3 spell difference is negligible (especially compared to a 14 spell difference), there are no bad choices here.    This is optimal design for the feat; All choices are meaningful, there are no traps, and everything is equally powerful."

All of the Warlock ritual spells are on the wizard list as are all the sorcerer ritual spell besides water walk also.

Wizards can learn spells by leveling, which falls in line with other spellcasters like Warlocks and Sorcerers. They can learn spells from transcribing but it's not like they're completely dysfunctional if they don't.  And if that part feels like something you need to ""shoehorn in"" then try simple alternate ways that don't feel that way. You could have a wizard who learns from watching another spell and then studying, or one who spends his free time experimenting and discovers them that way."
dndnext,3dfhy6,ventus,5,Wed Jul 15 21:58:49 2015 UTC,This. Wizards are fine without finding spells. It is just an extra perk.  More important is including beasts for druids to observe.
dndnext,3dfhy6,SirPeebles,-2,Thu Jul 16 01:35:09 2015 UTC,"It's an extra rule regarding loot that doesn't synergise with any of the other classes and requires the DM to have done their homework on your class.  I mention it especially because I'm playing Baldurs Gate 2 again right now and the spell book transcribing is extremely fun. But with the proliferation of classes in the latest edition I feel it doesn't fit in. And the rate of acquiring spells by level doesn't feel right when your special ability is your spell book and its variety of cheat codes that you can reorder. Otherwise you're better off playing Sorcerer or Warlock. My Baldurs Gate wizard is more fun is what I'm saying. My 5e wizard feels like he's missing something. And I don't want to encourage newbies at my table to play wizards now because of how crummy this feature feels in practice.  I like the Blue Mage method of acquiring spells however, I'll certainly consider that for my own games."

dndnext,3dfhy6,The_Chirurgeon,0,Thu Jul 16 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"A +1 weapon can do something for a spellcaster.

The general argument is that everyone who doesn't know about Spellbook-Pokemon is a bad DM. I don't feel that's the case with the DMs I've played under. The games are fine, they just aren't aware of this rule. In fact I've seen so many rule book dives in my time (Chris Perkins in the 2015 live game no less) that saying, ""you gotta know all the rules"", is a bit of a tall task.  I think I'll be opting for more scrolls in my games in future, and asking for more scrolls as a player.

Having developed videogames for 8 years I have something of a bone to pick with accessibility. Especially any lack of it.  The rules for darkvision are reiterated on every single race.

Things like concentration to get players to make more interesting spell lists instead of all buffs.  My beef is that what I'm feeling is an important bit of world building is in a box-text on one page of the PHB. If I include that in my open table games and no newbies are rolling wizards then it's a bit weird having all this wizard-only loot lying around.
