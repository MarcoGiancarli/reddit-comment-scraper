Swingers,3e6cjb,neb8neb,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:15:08 2015 UTC,"The U.S. Military has some very conservative regulations when it comes to sex.  I'm not 100% certain on British regulations, but there was nothing preventing it in Australia which is more closely aligned to your military.  Having said that, as an officer, it would be frowned upon, and could hurt career progression.  It would almost certainly get brought up in a background check if you're seeking a high enough security clearance.  To play it safe, I'd ask the question of someone in the RAF - anonymously if need be."

Swingers,3e3zhc,Nice-Rapist,4,Tue Jul 21 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"I would say it's dependent on the individual you're seeing. At the very least, make it clear you're not looking for an exclusive relationship fairly early.  And if they are, well, then you made a friend and you can both happily go other ways.  But if they are ok with non-exclusive, then you can maybe start to elaborate on what you enjoy."
Swingers,3e3zhc,Tymanthius,3,Tue Jul 21 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"Well, if you intend to continue in the lifestyle and/or include this person in that part of your life I would say the sooner the better. Maybe not on a first date (though why not if its truly a part of you) but certainly before either of you have a chance to get too emotionally attached."
Swingers,3e3zhc,MatticusVP,3,Tue Jul 21 20:57:51 2015 UTC,"i think it depends on how much swinging is apart of your life. if it a simple thing you like to do every once and a while. I think you can tell them later as long as they understand you have a wild side... but if its something you like to do often, then you need to let them know before things get started just how wild your side is."
Swingers,3e3zhc,badass2000,2,Tue Jul 21 20:40:35 2015 UTC,"Before you participate in any sexual activities.  Suppose you have sex with your friend and he later finds out that you are a swinger. It is possible that he will be upset about the risk of STDs that you have exposed him to. He may believe that risk to be higher than if you were sexually active but not a swinger.  Now I'm not saying that the risk actually is higher, just that a non-swinger may see things this way and be upset as a result. Before I started swinging, my wife and I worried about this, and concluded that we could live with the risk. But it did weigh on our minds, and sometimes still does. (I have no idea how the risk actually compares between swingers and non-swingers for our demographics.)  I think it is unfair to impose this worry on someone you are dating."
Swingers,3e3zhc,emmett419,3,Tue Jul 21 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"I think that depends on if you're playing at the same time as dating.  I tend to stop playing when starting to date someone new, so I keep that bit private until such time as I feel we're moving to a deeper stage of a relationship."
Swingers,3e3zhc,mnbidude,3,Tue Jul 21 21:00:24 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm leaning towards.  Especially with a new guy I started dating.  He's 15 years younger, and is really not relationship material, in my eyes."

Swingers,3e3zhc,enoughwiththebread,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty darn soon I would say. If you are not willing to commit to monogamy and that is the default expectation of the person or people you're dating, that needs to be known up front, as it can absolutely be a dealbreaker for both of you."
Swingers,3e3zhc,flwrsme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:22 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends what you are looking for.  Is your dating, in the vanilla world and attempt to find a husband?  Do you feel you will always be in the LS?  If your answer to these two questions is yes, then you should say so before you even go on a date.  Why waste either of yours time?  However if you are willing to not be in the LS, if once you found ""the one"" then I don't see the point of bringing it up at all."

Swingers,3e3zhc,riverthrowaway,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:20:09 2015 UTC,"I would be clear that you are non-monogamous from the very beginning, certainly before any physical interaction. No need to get into any gory details, just be clear that you are seeing others. This gives the other person all the information they need to make an informed decision about you for the time being. If you are just looking for a FWB, most guys will be OK with this arrangement.   If you hit it off and it is looking like it might be a more long term thing then you can share more details of what exactly you are up to and gauge the interest of the person of joining you in LS activities. Since you are already in a non-monogamous situation the most difficult part of the talk is already taken care of."
Swingers,3e3zhc,Big_Pete1999,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:27:50 2015 UTC,"It all really depends on your level of dating this person.  Are you two up front and agreeing that it's a casual thing? Are you guys ultimately looking for a long term relationship?  If you are hoping for a long term relationship, then I'd tell him before things got physical between you two (if they haven't already).  If you are just casually dating, then you really don't need to say anything until/unless it changes (although that could lead to him feeling misled). Even then, you could frame it in the ""I find it hot to ........"" and hope that it would progress along the lines of if you were already married and not a swinger and wanting to become a swinger.  It all rests on your intentions with this person moving forward. If you're wanting long term, mention sooner rather than later. If you don't even know what you want with the relationship, then why open up that can of worms? He may be a swinger too, or he may be a closeted bible thumper who dumps you. If you don't even know what you want out of the relationship yet though, then why add in that stress?  I said all of that to say this: There is no right or wrong answer. Go with your gut. It could be a huge turn on for him, or he could decide to end it, or he could decide to baby step it and role play till he's comfy. There really is no right answer or scripted plan of action."
Swingers,3e3zhc,DoubleEntendre_,2,Tue Jul 21 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say most people are ultimately looking for an exclusive relationship so I'd be up front about it pretty early.  Like how I'd expect somebody who was poly or the like to be clear about that from the start.  At most, I'd feel mislead if I found out anytime after a second date."
Swingers,3e3zhc,halo_will27,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Quick answer,  no.  The guy will say,  cool i can bang her with permission to bang others.  I would establish the relationship if there will be one and go from there.  Be with that person and bring it up.  Im your age and was in that scenario.  Its harder for men i feel because we will just be called horned cheaters.  Granted im happily married and the wife and i swing.  We just ran into that scenario before,  just saying"

Swingers,3e5t1g,NotReallyBi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:10:08 2015 UTC,"Agree with finding a fun couple you get along with.  That's how it happened with quite a few couples we've known.  Or just look around on SLS, I would think, for decent single guys.  I'm sure you'll find no shortage of men, and guessing that your mailbox is soon to be flooded anyway (hell, we'll help out! :)"
Swingers,3e5t1g,parisswing,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:26:51 2015 UTC,"Go to a club, or have a stringent filtering system. I found my best third on a dating website by being brutally honest about what I wanted. Your inbox will be most definitely be overcrowded, but you want someone who is relaxed and not pushy, respectful, and that you can get along with whether sex is involved or not.  For the love of god, don't use CL. Go straight for your most popular dating site, or even better - do what I did and find a gorgeous man on Reddit :)   The best threesome I have ever had was with a partner I had at the time, and a YOUNG AS FUCK guy from the larger region I live in. It was incredible. I found him on a dating website that is country specific (I live in NZ) and it was awesome. We were very specific about what we wanted and had a drink or two with him before getting started. It was good,you need to feel comfortable that the first time the female is entirely in control (even if on the outside it doesn't seem that way). If you have control fantasies (bdsm etc) that needs to come after the first encounter :)"
Swingers,3e5t1g,megsfrenchtoast,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:24:07 2015 UTC,"I would think that most guys that are OK with MFM would be fine with DP. Finding a quality SM is no easy task though. Lots of single guys don't really think the whole group sex thing all the way through and fold faster than superman on laundry day when it comes to naked time with another guy around. Others balk at the close contact with another guy that is required to make DP happen, and if you want DVP the whole crossing swords thing is another point of possible freak out. So look for someone with some LS experience that knows what they are doing in this scenario.  If you do use a LS lifestyle website there is often a referral or verification for users. You could find a verified SM, and then message a couple of the people who verified him and ask about the guy.   I know that in our group of friends the topic of pros and cons of various singles is a common topic of conversation when we get together. Once you get to know a few couples and make some friends just ask some people. Of course most couples will probably be down for this too, so if you get that far, your problem will be solved lol."
Swingers,3e42pe,Swinger_throwsaway,2,Tue Jul 21 20:14:14 2015 UTC,We enjoy getting the rendezvous notifications that some send to those on their friend list.  It helps us know when people we'd like to meet are available.  We also like having a list of people we've contacted to shop through vs. having to remember everyone's less-than-unique screen names.

Swingers,3e42pe,69Karma69,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:55:06 2015 UTC,"There is no correct way, you can run your friends list however you please. We tend to keep it as people we've met and know, but at the moment we've also been adding couples from the USA who we have chatted a bit too and are hoping there is a chance of meeting on our trip over there in September."
Swingers,3e42pe,Taleros,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:25 2015 UTC,It's just a way to mark couples you want to track. That's it. It's public which is kind of cool because you can surf networks.  Don't overthink it.

Swingers,3dz5dd,NoRegratsYo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:59 2015 UTC,"We live in a fairly isolated area, the major town is not too bad of size at about 150,000... When we first started we were surprised at how active swinging was with bi-weekly parties, a well attended monthly meet, and good activity on some of the sites...   After being active for the better part of a year we took about a year off and are now getting active again and it is night and day: The three couples that hosted parties in our area are gone or no longer doing parties, the monthly meet has about a third of the people, and the three sites where our area showed OK activity (SLS, swingular, Kasadie) are way down with Kasadie being almost dead (the ""whos on now"" used to show 10-20 people in our area, now the nearest person is not even in our state) Swingular and SLS are OK but way down from before. Had we started with this activity now we would have concluded there was no interest in our area and given up.  So I think the answer for smaller areas is that if there are a few active people promoting it then people will gather and the scene develops. If nobody is promoting it then people are looking everywhere, not seeing each other in decent numbers, and giving up quickly.. Seeing our local scene has imploded has been sad. We've been thinking about if we want to put ourselves out there and try a party and get-togethers and be the promoters or if we just want to travel..   Having said all that if I were in your shoes I would first get accounts on every major site and search for locals - it is amazing how regional the sites are, even when our area was very active it was still pretty slow on all the sites but a couple."

Swingers,3e0qf4,massagethrowaway999,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:19 2015 UTC,"You found a sex club with a pool? Nice. Well there is no etiquette for a boner. Most swing clubs have rooms for having sex. There isn't alot of nudity outside those rooms. In fact, male nudity outside those rooms is frowned upon.  If your just an exhibitionist then find a nudist resort or beach. Lots of nudity and no sex."
Swingers,3e0qf4,Pleasing_her,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks I looked up the club and the entire building is clothing optional, not just in the sex rooms. I'm sure that they'll be people tanning nude and swimming also. The club prominently advertises that it's the whole club that is clothing optional and encourages people to attend during the day as well.   Unfortunately the nude beach is pretty far for me, so the club is really my only option for skinny dipping and tanning.   What would you recommend given that the whole club is clothing optional and that male nudity outside the sex rooms is very likely?   Thanks again!"
Swingers,3e0qf4,TheBauhausCure,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:28 2015 UTC,"The club we attend is clothing optional as well, but really only the girls get topless/naked outside the private rooms. Men stay clothed unless they're having sex in one of the public areas and then put their clothes back on.  If you go to a swingers clun as a single male and walk around naked, you'll probably be reported."
Swingers,3e0qf4,TheBauhausCure,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:06:24 2015 UTC,"This club is very progressive it seems like, they advertise the clothing optional aspect prominently and the days everyone is able to attend. They have Clothed Female Naked Male events as well."
Swingers,3e0qf4,TheBauhausCure,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:58:05 2015 UTC,"So do most other swingers clubs. So if you attend the event you mentioned you'll probably be fine, but I promise you, you won't be welcomed warmly if you go on a random night only to walk around naked."
Swingers,3e0qf4,TheBauhausCure,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:59:59 2015 UTC,"I'll be observant of other men, don't want to do anything that singles me out and puts me in a negative light. I plan on going during the day for the pool initially and if I feel comfortable then I'll go at night.   If I go I'll likely walk around the club with a towel on and take it off for swimming and when I'm laying out in the sun. That's the big thing for me I just like to be open and tan nude."
Swingers,3e0qf4,Uncut273,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:36:31 2015 UTC,So why not go to a nude beach? I'm just confused as to why you think a swingers club is the right place for you. Being a swinger doesn't equate to being a nudist.
Swingers,3e0qf4,mayamys,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:37:59 2015 UTC,"I know but the nude beach is a lot farther for me. If the beach was closer I would go there instead. The swingers club is the closest clothing optional place with a pool to me. I also know that nudists are not really tolerant of boners, which I know I'll get if I go to Oasis.   Oasis even says on the site that you can just enjoy the facilities, there's no pressure to have sex if you don't want to, from what I've read if I want to tan naked and skinny dip I can do that."
Swingers,3e0qf4,mayamys,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:46:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, well, when you go and don't see anyone running around naked except a few girls, you'll realize what I'm saying."

Swingers,3e0qf4,usewhippedcream,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:57:31 2015 UTC,Is it Oasis Aqualounge in Toronto? If so most people there who are having sex in the open like to be watched.

Swingers,3e0qf4,usewhippedcream,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:04 2015 UTC,"Wow it is Oasis actually amazing how you knew! If I could jerk off in public that would really turn me on but I don't know if it's frowned upon and only sex is allowed in public.   If jerking off in public is not allowed I would just like to walk around the club completely nude with out a towel and not having to worry about feeling embarrassed having a boner. If I have a boner walking around I don't think it's a big deal personally but I don't want to offend anyone or get kicked out for having a visible boner.  If just like to feel completely free, if I have a boner I don't want to be judged or feel embarrassed"
Swingers,3dyw24,senorbiloba,4,Mon Jul 20 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"Unless you're in the know, you're going to continue to find what you described at the parties you see advertised.  Open-invite parties are good for getting into invite-only parties (hint-hint).     Since Sesso closed, I wouldn't waste time going to the other sex clubs in town if you're looking to find them full of the under-40 crowd.    For online, I'd say Kasidie is probably you're best bet if age is your limiting factor.  LL is full of hot couples, though, while they say '39', they're probably pushing 50.  But hey, if you can't tell, who cares, right?   AFF is also good but they have quite the mix of young, old, big, small, but they have a good selection of hipsters for you.  Down side is that they have a lot of single dudes - LOTS."

Swingers,3dyw24,MatticusVP,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:43 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  Here, unfortunately, it grows a new couple about every two or three months.  We tell others about it and they all agree it's good, it's just getting them to switch, which is the hard part."
Swingers,3dyw24,NWCPL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"I guess we kind of made the switch out of necessity. I never liked SLS very much, but found Kasidie to be very useful. My girlfriend and I were on there for maybe a year and a half before the subscription fees went up, too much for it to be worth it for us. Quiver has filled that spot for us so that we can still maintain a presence online and meet other couples."
Swingers,3dyw24,MatticusVP,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"Try helping them? I've referred 20 or so couples and singles to the site and repped for them at an event. One of the couples I referred is throwing a Q sponsored house party for them, another couple that throws massive parties in the area is now onboard and wants to throw a huge Q sponsored party in September. Quiver's New England membership used to be pitiful, I'd like to think I played a pretty big part in helping it grow. It's awesome now. Not as many accounts as SLS, but it has a lot of good quality real accounts."
Swingers,3dyw24,jollycooperation420,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:53 2015 UTC,"We definitely tell people about it.  It's just that people in our area are so well-ingrained with Kasidie, SLS, AFF, and even LL that it's hard to introduce a new site without getting an eye-roll.  Still, we pass it along."

I was honest with my wife, and now, when I see a spider, I call her and she comes and kills it. I trust her not to judge me or make fun of me and help me out.    Until or unless you can get over this irrational feeling you get, you'll need to tell your wife and ask that she helps you out. MFM, everything is cool - alone time with the other guy, no. There is something about it that sets your nerves on edge.   No matter what,  it is never your job to ""get over"" being uncomfortable with something.  It's both people's job to find that happy medium where both people can enjoy this in a place of trust and ease. Then, everyone has fun.   Talk to her. Set boundaries and move forward.    Good luck."

Do not feel bad about wanting/needing the chance to reconnect as a couple.  It is unfortunate that she wasn't feeling well, and that happens, but make sure she knows that you two having some alone time shortly after a 'play date' is important to you.  As FeetInTheWater said, open and honest communication is the most important thing.  If you two can't talk about something, who else are you going to talk to?  (Besides people on Reddit that is.)"

Swingers,3dwn9n,TheBauhausCure,2,Mon Jul 20 13:45:13 2015 UTC,"It's perfectly valid to feel the way you do. Swinging is generally considered a ""couple"" activity, and many, believe it or not, do not do ""seperate"" room play. It's not something you have to get over, and you need to articulate that to your wife.  That being said, I think a good step to getting over how you feel is letting her know that even if she is too sore for sex with you afterwards, she can't push you away during after care. That is time for you and her to let each other know how much you love each other and that what you did was for mutual enjoyment of each other!  My very first time, I was nervous, but every time my husband was ""getting busy"" and I glanced over to him, he smiled at me, and I knew that this was something we were experiencing together.  If he had bounded off with her to the showers I probably would've felt awful, but he didn't. The moment they were done (her poor husband couldn't perform, so I was a bit frustrated) he immediately gave me a hug and cuddled me. We were there for each other, not the other couple."

I wouldn't grrr mad at her if she took a shower with another guy, but I'd tell her it made me feel anxious, and she'd never do it again.  I wouldn't feel bad about the way you feel, and rather than put energy in to changing the way you feel, put the effort in to preventing it from happening.

How would you go about declining someone who technically fits the criteria for your ""type"", but has some other deal-breaker, such as the way they smell (not poor hygiene, but ""chemistry"")?  For example, I could hit it off with looks and personality, but if their normal everyday smell reminded me of my father, I'd lose my lady-boner for that person, or never get one in the first place.  ETA: I would tell them straight-up, ""I was into you until I found out that the way you smell reminds me of my father.  It is what it is.  Sorry if I wasted your time"" or something like that."
Swingers,3drj1i,scootah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:28:23 2015 UTC,"The point of my previous post was kind of that 'too masculine' is a nice way to reject someone. It doesn't need to be true - but it's a gentle way to let a fairly common type of person down when they don't do it for you for whatever reason. It doesn't feel like as harsh a rejection as 'you have an ugly moustache' or 'we were into you until we saw your face, and now we're not any more'.    And yeah, we do prefer androdgynous guys. But it's not a particularly firm preference.  We like lots of people. Sometimes it's just a polite lie to avoid hurting someone's feelings.  Sometimes we don't have a polite lie route out so we'll just say 'Sorry, it's not working for us, thanks for chatting to us'. Or sometimes we just fade out. But we go to a lot of real world play parties and stuff - and we try to be as nice about stuff like that as we can because we don't want to deal with hurt feelings or someone who's not great with rejection at parties in future."
Swingers,3drj1i,ref2018,2,Sat Jul 18 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree that ""too masculine"" comes across as a compliment even when delivered as the reason for the rejection.  Likewise, when someone's ordinary body aroma brings up a reminder of something that kills the sexy-mood, that is something that the person can't control (unless it's poor hygiene, cigarettes, etc. or if they ate too much garlic; personally I like the smell of garlic on other people as well as on myself, and I even used to shove it up my snatch to keep away yeast infections, but that's another story for another time), and it really isn't about ""them"", it's about ""me"".  The reason I took my comment in this direction was to expand the discussion to ""ways/reasons to reject someone if you thought their photos were attractive enough to meet them in person, and THEN you realize it ain't happening"", or if you met someone at a club or party and didn't notice their smell right away because you were busy with doggy-style or something.

If this ever came out, like say, the other couple saw you playing with an obviously more masculine man, then you've just quadrupled the drama than if you'd just said, ""On second thought, no thanks.""  Yeah, it stings a bit now, but not as much as finding out you've beend given a false excuse.  We're all adults here.  Rejection is part of the game.  I've been rejected after seeing my face pics, and yeah, it doesn't feel great, but I have yet to run out of people on SLS, so it doesn't sting for very long.

She may very well not want to risk ruining a friendship for one night of passion (or a weekend). You get my drift. There is also no guarantee she's sexually attracted to you, her, or the two of you as a couple.   Second: If she is down, make sure you limit drinking. Drinking and anxiety = erectile dysfunction. It doesn't matter if you're 18 years old and have never had an issue before, drinking and anxiety over a threesome often times leads to problems. So blue pill up so you can take your mind off of performing. I know many couples who's male halves have issues because they get anxious and nervous. We've experienced this multiple times from other couples. So do everyone a favor and have a plan B (pill) just in case. Odds are, you'll need it.  Good luck."

Make sure you both are on the same page. Discuss boundaries. Discuss that it's about three ppl not two girls on you and not you fucking your girls friend in front of her. That's not a three some, that's stuff that happens.(sounds crazy right) you don't want you girl to feel the next day you have too much attention to her and didn't split it.  Be flirty early on. Compliment her. Also a good test, after you flirt a little take your girl to the side and talk. How she's feeling, how you are, problems? If there are talk about them, if it's not good then stop.  Touch. Your girl touches her leg or you touch the small of her back sends ALOT of signals.  Have the balls to take a risk. Be an adult. Be a gentlemen. You WILL get off if this happens, be patient. Good luck.   Tequila helps.   Tequila sunrises:  1 1/2 oz tequila   4 oz orange juice   1 tbsp grenadine   Pour tequila in glass. Fill with ice. Fill with oj. Pour grenadine on top, it will sink to the bottom since it's the most dense thing to mix with the tequila that floats up. Stir if you like or enjoy the layers of flavors.  Keep us posted."

You know the friend is a freak.. But is your gf cool with you moving things along? Or flirting with her friend? Make it about them and not you.

Your biggest obstacle is that there will be a lot of people around. And most likely several single guys. You have one shot at this!   If you're lucky enough or have worked enough game to get both girls back to the room, get out your iPhone after making drinks. Tell the girls to get a pic, then a selfie of the three of you. Then get them two doing goofy stuff fr the cam, duck face, kissy face, then tell them to get a kiss pic of just a peck.. Be natural about it and unscripted and go with the flow. Play it right and tell them how hot the pic is and they will want more. About 90 seconds of this and they will be making out hot n heavy.

The difference between swinging and cheating is the honesty...something that has already been broken.  This is just for the health of your relationship...please work on fixing whatever lead to your infidelity first and be solid and strong before continuing. It might feel ok now, but those cracks created before will start to show and do more damage if not fixed now.  As for Christianity and the lifestyle. They don't honestly go together if you belong to a fundamentalist branch of Christianity. As long as you take the bible as a metaphor and not the true word of God, you should be ok. Fundamentalist thinking you're going to have to figure out the adultery part, as well as the homosexual issue.  If you take the bible as more a guide book for living well, then it should be ok. As an ex Roman Catholic, the whole going to hell thing is hard to rectify. Don't worry about he grand majority of redditors who will try and mock or deride your attempt to make your religion a part of your life. It is not common to mix the two, but it's not impossible. Remember, your God does love you. Enjoying sex, which was made pleasurable for us by him, will probably not make you go to hell. He will most likely applaud that you enjoyed his gift so much that invited others to join as well!  Lastly, just because I am a big proponent of the whole gay movement on a human equality side of things...since you have thought of girl on girl and at least contemplated it, I hope you also see that others should be able to do the same. I hope you see that it's only right for people to be able to express love of the same sex in similar ways which you discussed. The God I read about when I was not an atheist would have more an issue with those trying to break love than to share it in interesting ways.   Any who, have fun in the lifestyle. Don't worry about whether or not you're doing right by God. You prove that in your actions and in your deeds. His reward is to enjoy this world he created for us, and all its pleasures."
Swingers,3dlyno,pixiegod,5,Fri Jul 17 14:27:27 2015 UTC,"I want to address swinging and Christianity from a Biblical perspective.   First I want to say I do consider myself a Christian, but I am not by any stretch an authority in the church. Second I want to base the argument I'm about to present on the following assumptions.    Belief that there is one true God and Christ is your personal savior Belief that the Bible is the written word of God   If you ( or any reader posting a counter argument) don't believe in these 2 things then the point is mute as we are discussing swinging in terms of Christianity.   Ok so we have to break this down into a couple things. Really questions that need to be answered.   Is sex outside of marriage a sin or banned in the Bible? Is polygamy or having multiple partners a sin? How do we define adultery in the context of the 10 commandments? What exactly is sexual sin and what is it not?   I'll go in respective order:  1/ Is sex outside of marriage a sin or banned in the Bible?  The simple answer here is no. In fact here is a source on an opposing view that specifically states that the Bible doesn't directly state this. http://family.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/26204/~/where-does-the-bible-say-that-pre-marital-sex-is-wrong%3F. However they do make some counter points that I want to address as well.   Here is the argument you see a lot when this comes up:  “Have you not read,” says Jesus, “that He who made them at the beginning ‘made them male and female,’ and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?’” (Matthew 19:4-5; quoting from Genesis 1:27, 2:24). In this passage Scripture clearly states that sex is for marriage and marriage is for sex  Does it really clearly state that "" sex is for marriage and marriage is for sex""? I would say no not even close. Let us first examine what has happened. This blogger is taking an English translation of the Bible out of context and applying an opinion that they feel fits. However; the original bible wasn't written in English. If you take a look at this passage among the varying different bibles of today you can see it is easy to find different variations of what is being said. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A4-5&version=DRA.  Now let's take the fact that there are over 20 different translations just on the site I linked. Then consider that this book has been reworked and edited for about 2000 years. Do you think maybe taking the English version and inferring an opinion from it makes sense? No it doesn't and you shouldn't. So if inferring an opinion from a 2000 year game of telephone is the only way to make the stretch that sex outside of marriage is a sin... Then I think we can say that the mainstream church/opinion may have it wrong. If sex is such a big deal wouldn't God have been more clear on the subject? Yet of all things sex seems to be one of the most vague topics in the Bible.   2/ Is polygamy or having multiple partners a sin?  There is no one passage that outlaws multiple partners in the Bible. Here (http://www.bibleresearch.org/articles/alw2.htm) is a source that breaks this down with verses, but it is one of many sources that agree with me on this. So if polygamy isn't a sin then logic would follow that multiple partners within a marriage covenant is not a sin assuming all members are in the know. This leads me into my next topic of Adultery and how to define it.   3/ How do we define adultry in the context of the 10 commandments?  Ok so we know that ""Do not commit adultery"" is the 7th commandment. This may seem like the nail in the proverbial swinger coffin, but how does the bible define adultery. Is it cheating? Is it any sex other than your spouse? Is masturbating to porn adultery? I could go on, but let's again examine this. Again; obviously the word adultery wasn't the original text. The original text looked like this: http://www.levitt.com/hebrew/commandments.html. However; the actual translation isn't perfect. The Hebrew to English translation doesn't code word for word. This means context and meaning has to be inferred by the translators opinion of the message that needs to come across.   So how do we know what is correct? Well what does other parts of the Bible tell us. We have examples of men with multiple partners some of which were not married to these partners. For example Abraham, Lot, David, Solomon. A small list of many men that were held as righteous in the Bible, but had extra marital consorts. Need a female example? How about Rahab (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahab). Let me be direct here. You can't tell me that Almighty God couldn't have came up with a better plan than using a female prostitute to distract the enemy so that the Hebrew spies could get intel. This is God after all. Rahab is a perfect example that sexual sin and morality is a context based situation. Either we have to believe God broke his own commandment, or our understanding of the commandment is not the same as God's. I'm going with option 2. This leads me into the point of context.  Is there a right and wrong context for extramarital sex? We know that Jesus broke the sabbath to help others and was scorned for it. I'll type that again Jesus broke a commandment because the context of the situation didn't fit the intent. Jesus knew and asserts that the commandment for the sabbath is for man to rest and not to put him in bondage. Can we not infer from this behavior that other commandments are equally flexible with context. How about not killing? Jesus addressed a group of soldiers during his travels yet never mentioned that they are sinners for serving in the military. Again the context doesn't fit the commandment. God himself orders the Hebrews to kill during most of the old testament. So could adultery not be flexible while these other commandments clearly are?   Take a look at this website. http://www.prageruniversity.com/Ten-Commandments/Do-Not-Commit-Adultery.html#.VakukflVhBc  Here we see the assertion that:  “Because adultery can destroy the foundational unit of a society -- the family. If exposed, adultery leads to a sense of betrayal. If hidden, it forces the offending spouse to lie. Children are often the unintended victims. This may be one of the most difficult Biblical laws to follow, but it's also one of the most important.”  Ok but what if your sex life is open and trusting. What if there is no betrayal because your spouse is in the know and participating with you. There would be no lies because everyone involved knows what is going on. There would be no unintended children victims because there would be no betrayal. We also have great birth control methods today so children growing up without families would also not be a concern. So in the context of swinging all of the negatives are negated. Which means in the correct context the swinging would not be destructive to a family. I mean let's remember that God loves us. Do you really believe that God is a tyrant that would say “Hey I know there are no negative consequences to this, but I still said no so you can't do it because someone else may harm themselves in a completely different context, even though you can handle it”? That isn't the God I believe in. The God I believe in is loving and just. The God I worship wrote the Song of Songs https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song%20of%20Songs%201.   So if commandments can be broken or flexed due to context, and the context of swinging isn't destructive to families… Then you could logically argue that swinging is not breaking the Adultery commandment. Think that is a stretch? Let's not forget that Lot had a threesome with his daughters shortly after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot a man that the Bible identifies as a good and holy man. While on the subject of Sodom and Gomorrah I'd like to point out that the Bible lists the reason why the 2 cities were destroyed.  In the entire 761 words written about why Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed there is not one mention of sex. Yet most of mainstream Christianity will tell you the 2 cities were destroyed because of their sexual sin… yet the Bible makes no mention of it."
Swingers,3dlyno,Oltima,0,Fri Jul 17 17:23:06 2015 UTC,"4/ What exactly is sexual sin and what is it not?  This will probably be the hardest to explain or even make a point on simply because the Bible is very bleak in referencing sexual sin. We hear the words “sexual sin” used in a few places in the Bible and even Jesus talks about sexual sin… but defining sexual sin isn't something that is laid out for us. I think there is a reason for that. God wrote this book knowing that it would be passed down through thousands of years. Most of the Bible and especially the life of Jesus takes context into consideration. For example; when the Bible talks about fornicators it is in fact speaking about prostitutes ( or more specifically engaging with a prostitute). The root word of fornicator is forn. In the time it was used to describe the arches that were popular architecture. Prostitutes would usually be found under these forns. The “Johns” engaging with these prostitutes were called fornicators. Today the word fornicator means sex outside of marriage, but that was not the original use. We know that Jesus singles out sexual sin as a greater sin because you sin against your own body. Yet he doesn't describe the confines of sexual sin. How about a sexual act that you feel shameful of afterward? I would say that is sexual sin. Engaging in sex that you or your partner don't want. What other conclusion does the Bible let us come to? If sex is such a big deal (and to be clear it is a big deal to the established church of today, but oddly not a big topic in the Bible) then why isn't there more emphasis on sex in the Bible. The conclusion I would draw is that God wants you to be happy in all aspects of life including your sex life. If you sex life isn't hurting you or others then it is not sinful.  Ok so now that I have my argument established I want to note a couple things. First is that I intentionally omitted using Leviticus as a basis of argument. The reason being that Leviticus is a set of rules that the Hebrews were instructed to follow and was meant for a specific time. Don't believe me? Then you probably haven't actually read Leviticus. I don't know of many Christians that check their apples to ensure cleanliness. I'm willing to bet most Christians wear clothes that contain multiple fabrics. Then of course there are tattoos which are explicitly forbidden in Leviticus. It doesn't apply today and is not written in any way that would suggest it should apply today. It is simply a book that lists historical laws. Laws written by a man by the way.   Finally I want to address those saying that OP and other Christian Swingers are doing “mental gymnastics” to make a lifestyle fit into their religion. To that I say no. Let's be real there are multiple sects and denomination of the Christian faith. Each differ in how and why they interpret certain things. They can't all be right. Do we as Humans really believe that God would make so much unclear if context wasn't important? That is for you to decide. I for one take from Jesus's mention of the golden rule “So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.”  https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A12&version=ESV. Are you breaking this rule? If no then you are most likely not sinning. Do we not have 1 Thessalonians 5:21  "" but test everything; hold fast what is good."" (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A21&version=ESV). Is this not God saying if it feels right and doesn't hurt others than it is OK?"
Swingers,3dlyno,Oltima,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:30 2015 UTC,Your religion is irrelevant to swinging. Its more of a conversation topic at most. Swingers come from all walks. I've once sat at a bar at a swingers club and drank a beer with an Israeli and a Palestinian. There is no reason you can't structure you home life in a way to raise you kids with christian values and participate in swinging. The two spheres ought not overlap so they need not be fully consistent. Just be honest with yourself.
Swingers,3dlyno,Southernerd,-1,Fri Jul 17 11:21:24 2015 UTC,"The problem I see is that ""christian values"" usually includes a sex-negative component. Do we want to raise another generation of kids with misinformation about sex?"

I don't think there is a standard stereotype you can apply to all persons identifying as Christian or claim that swinging is a purely atheistic activity.

Swingers,3dlyno,Swingersbaby,0,Fri Jul 17 12:50:52 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to point out that there's a lot of different sects in Christianity, some far more liberal than others.  While the conservative, gay-hating ones seem to be the most popular in the US today, there are some Protestant denominations like the Presyterians who have female and/or gay ministers and have a very different take on many issues than the typical evangelicals.  There do seem to be some Christian groups out there that don't buy into the anti-sex stuff that seems to be a big part of the religion.  Now, how the Mexican drug lords can justify their behavior, I have no idea, but I guess when you get down to it it's not much different than greedy Americans going to church religiously and preaching Christianity and then advocating for Objectivism, social Darwinism, letting poor people die if they can't afford medical treatment, etc."

When you went through your trials of adultery you should have put your wife to death per your good book. Then you could have just raped some other girl and she would be forced to become your wife due to the rape. Perhaps one of your slaves that your book condones? I could go on..... Just cherry pick your book and your god for the things that match your lifestyle best. Build your god in your image. This is what  christianity has become and what christians are. The good news is your magical book condones fucking all kinds of women as long as their part of your clan of multiple wives. Just remember when you fuck someone elses wife or your wife fuck some other dude they must be put to death. Steep price to pay.

Swingers,3dlyno,Oltima,2,Sat Jul 18 04:30:45 2015 UTC,I appreciate you taking the time to write a long thoughtful response and ill be addressing what you said. 2 questions first though.   Do you believe the old and new testament to be the word of god? Do you believe the old and new testaments were meant to be taken literally?   Thanks
Swingers,3dlyno,ghostsofvalhalla,0,Sun Jul 19 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"Of course :)  1  I believe the old and New Testament to be the word of God in their original format. Meaning the prophets and apostles that wrote the original text I believe were God giving us information through the people he choose. However; I don't believe the Bible in it's current form to be the word of God. The reason being is that after thousands of years being re-written and translated into multiple different languages there is no doubt to me that the people making copies of the Bible have altered it for the purpose of power and political gain. A good example of this today would be taking a look at the Bible a Lutheran has and the Bible a Catholic has. Both are Bibles said to be the written word of God supposedly unperverted for thousands of years. However; comparing the two books would reveal that both on many things. They can't both be the word of God so what happened? Well as language changed and view points changed throughout history the translators had to decide what what to use to translate from one language to another. Pretty much an impossible task to get correct. The translator would have to consider context, jargon, colloquialisms and idioms and try to translate to another language to people living in a completely different world. So because of the Human factor in the Bible we have today I am careful on deciding how I translate for myself what is in the book. I will look for Hebrew and Aramaic translation for clarity. An example of this would be Genesis where the current translation say the Earth/Universe was created in 6 days and then God rested on the 7th. Well the word for day in Hebrew is more closer to our word for ages. So Genesis could easily have been translated to God made the Heavens and Earth in 6 Ages and rested on the 7th. Small change in words, completely different meaning.   2  There are books in the Bible that are meant to be taken literally and some that are clearly not. For example Proverbs. It's a book of insight. You can't really take it literally because it's a book of parables which by nature are not to be taken literally. The parable of the talents isn't an account of a historical event. It's a fictional story to explain about using the gifts you are given to their full amount. I would never take a fictional story literally, but it is a part of the Bible. Song of Songs also not something I take literally. It's an erotic book about the joy that sex brings. I'm pretty sure Solomons's wife didn't have a vagina that actually tasted like fine wine. I'm pretty sure when it says "" I will climb the palm tree and pick it's fruit"" we aren't talking about coconuts.   Now the parts that are supposed to be taken literal yes I 100% believe in them. I believe Jesus was the Messiah. I believe he raised Lazarus from the dead, and all the other miracles described in the Bible. I believe he died on that cross and was reborn 3 days later. I believe in Heaven and that Jesus is my savior. I believe that Moses spoke directly to God and he parted the Red sea."

We started this as a discussion over what the bible actually says in regards to OPs question. You were staying slighty on topic, but this keeps digressing into you trying to prove to me that God as I believe isn't real.

You are also replying to multiple threads so the that the debate (if it can be called that) can't even flow in a sequential timeline.   I never said I'm throwing out the entire Old Testament. I only made claim that Leviticus isn't a set of rules that Christians today are bound to follow. The Law of Moses and Leviticus are two seperate things and you are lumping them together as an entire book to justify your argument. You are critisizing my knowledge of the Bible, but you don't even know the difference between Leviticus, Exodus and the Old Testiment as a whole (or atleast what you have written suggest that you don't). You seem to also want to withold information from me while asking questions to setup some long argumentative attack against my believes that has nothing to do with the original topic.   To be succint I'm not interested in an argument with someone who is literally making up things to prove a point I have no intention of countering in the first place.

Turns out your religion isnt even the largest religion in the world. Or the oldest religion in the world for that matter. There are far more non christians on this planet than christians and they are not all to be blanket labeled as atheists. I can certainly disagree with your book and belong to any of a plethora of other faiths. The fact that you immediately break it down into a christian vs. atheist debate shows a small minded western tribalist mentality.

Swingers,3dlyno,ghostsofvalhalla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:29:39 2015 UTC,"Finally. I had mentioned that christians cherrypick their facts to conform to their own ego. That they build their god in their image. This is called ideology. I pointed out areas in the bible that either you hadnt read or choose to ignore. If the former, you are guilty of what you accuse me of, not reading the bible. If the latter, then youre an idealogue. The scientific method is about going at things with an open mind, doing research, reaching a conclusion based on that research. Ideology is about having a belief, then cherrypicking facts to back up that belief. As christians do you have bent over backwards trying to pretend youve reached your conclusions based on logic, study, and reasoning (the scientific method). This simply isnt the case. Had you used the scientific method you would have been forced to throw your religion in the rubbish bin. To put it succinctly, you want to believe. And who wouldnt, i would like to be immortal and live forever. I dont want to think when a loved one dies i will never see them again. You want to believe so bad that you suspend your rational thought process. This is in the interest of feeding your ego. These are obviously fables, right? Easily disproven fables at that. Any intelligent adult can see these are fables. Obviously a man cant live in a whale. Obviously you cant part the sea, etc, etc, etc, ad nauseum. At some point children must give up the comforting illusion of santa claus and the same goes with this nonsense drivel. Its a mass delusion predicated on the brainwashing of children and fear of death. Science has absolutely relegated christianity to myth many, many years ago. It has refuted damn near everything in your book. Christianity already belongs in the landfill with all the other dead religions that came before it and it stole all of its ideas from. But people hold on because they are scared to die. Just remember my original post was in response to someone else. You decided to engage me. I am ready and willing to debate anything about your religion you choose. Its a fools errand to debate a myth. At the end of the day all you have is faith couched as science. Children have faith that santa is real. Faith is by definition the suspension of logical thought. Perhaps your pseudo-intellectual psychobabble works on the ignorant. Perhaps penning massive pseudo-intellectual screeds with massive logic holes has worked for you in the past. Not this time."

Swingers,3dlyno,ghostsofvalhalla,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:54:54 2015 UTC,"Ok now that I have time sure I'll break this down piece by piece.   Let's start with your first set of comments.   You told OP that he should have put his wife to death because of the previous Adultry. I'm assuming you are refering to Leviticus 20:10 that says “ ""'If a man commits adultery with another man's wife--with the wife of his neighbor--both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death.” You didn't give a reference so I'll just have to go off this assumption. So since OP is a professed Christian and Leviticus is a book of rules that is clearly not under the new covenant ( both God the Father and Jesus state this in the New Testament), your assertion is false.  You then go on to say that “Then you could have just raped some other girl and she would be forced to become your wife due to the rape”. Also not true referring back to Leviticus OP would be put to death for doing so since he committed the rape. Plus he should already be dead due to the first case of Adultery. Again Christians aren't bound by Leviticus so the whole thing is false.   You said “Perhaps one of your slaves that your book condones? I could go on...”  First ""He who kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his possession, shall surely be put to death."" (Exodus 21:16)  So Exodus clearly states that the punishment for Slavery is death. The Bible does not condone slavery in the way that we know it today. The slaves refered to in Leviticus 25 are closer to indentured servitude where a person could agree to work for a master to pay off debts. Again this is a reference to the Old Testament. Slavery in the old testament is in a completely different context than it was during slavery in America, but I will agree that Slavery in any sense is wrong. Again Christians read the Old Testament as a history of how Christianity came to be. We as Christians are under no covenant or requirement by God to observe the Old Covenant except the parts that Jesus specifically states. It is simply a historical record of events according to our religion. Again Jesus and God assert this during the events of the New Testament. You are refusing to read Mathew so you will just have to trust that it is in there.   On to your reply  “If youre going to charge that what i said is out of context and/or false the onace is on you to prove that. “  Sure I agree with that. I was hoping the references I gave you would suffice, but you seem to have taken offense with my suggestion that you actually read the book you are trying to quote.   “I read your exhaustive screed on your magical skygod and its just your interpretation of your book of bronze age superstitions based around your ego.”  In a way yes. Everyone is going to have their own interpretation. It has nothing to do with my Ego though. It has to do with my moral beliefs and the research that I have done and continue to do. I didn't grow up in a religious family. What I believe is a culmination of my life experiences and my understanding of what I have read and been exposed to. When someone says swinging is against Christian believes my first response is going to be “OK well can you defend that position using the Bible”. Since the Bible is the ruling Book for Christian belief. I have yet to find someone that actually can give me a reference that makes that assertion clear.   “If youre going to make fantastical claims it requires substantial evidence.”  I agree with this statement, yet I don't understand the reason you wrote it. I don't need you to believe in the Bible or Christianity for any of this ( nor have I asked you to). I do think that if you are going to reference the Bible you should read and know exactly what you are referencing. As you can see from above I have references to your statements that clearly shows you have the data wrong. Even if we assume that Christians are supposed to follow Leviticus your statements would still be incorrect and that was the point I am making. You don't need to believe in the Bible to incorrectly quote it.   “I can write an exhaustive, convincing argument that a unicorn lives in my pocket but that doesnt make it so. Then when you challenge me i can just say its not on me to defend my absurd premise but in fact its on you because you obviously havent done sufficient research on pocket unicorns. “  That is called an ontological argument. A lot of accepted scientific research today such as the Big Bang and the existence of Black holes is based on ontological arguments. So actually I could make that argument however I'm not. I understand you don't believe in God and you believe the Bible is a fairy tale. That has nothing to do with you getting the information wrong. I don't believe Cinderella is a true story, but if I said Cinderella was a man I would still be wrong.   “To put it more succinctly, im not interested in your homework assignment. Youre making some assumptions about my knowledge of your magical sky fairy.   I had to make assumptions because you didn't reference anything you wrote. To be clear I wasn't giving you a homework assignment. I was simply trying to point you towards the material that you yourself were trying to reference. I'm going to assume now that you haven't read the Bible at all. This assumption is based on you refusing to read even the parts you were trying to quote. You don't have your information correct. It would benefit you as an Atheist that wants to argue against Christianity to get your information correct. If you want to argue against God then you need to understand the opposite argument. Or I guess I should say you would be able to create a better argument against God knowing the correct information.   “You challenged what i said as out of context or patently false. Make one argument backing up those claims or gtfo. “  I've given references to direct quotes from the bible that you quoted wrong. I have explained why even if your quotes were correct why they would be out of context. I have pointed out my view of why I think your thoughts are incorrect. Also to be clear I have no intention of converting you. I am fine with you not believing what I believe. Hell, I'll even agree with you that the case for God is bizarre and impossible to prove.

Swingers,3dlyno,ghostsofvalhalla,0,Sun Jul 19 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"The two lifestyles conflict because there is a significant difference (chasm?) between the moral codes used in the two different cultures. My wife and I are both Christian, actively attend church, and she teaches Sunday school. However, the difference is that we do not hold tightly to a single religious sect. Our studies and research have moved us more away from traditional Christian culture due mostly to the fact that politics have shaped much of the traditional doctrine.  So for us, it has really been a journey both of understanding ourselves and of understanding what our belief system really is as opposed to what the wider church doctrine promotes."
Swingers,3dlyno,thathacker,-1,Fri Jul 17 12:51:30 2015 UTC,"Don't take this the wrong way*... but have you read the bible? Like, at all?   Ephesians 5:5   For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.  Deuteronomy 22:22  “If a man is found lying with the wife of another man, both of them shall die, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman.   Matthew 5:27-30  “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.  Galatians 5:21  Envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.  Jeremiah 29:23  Because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel, they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them.   Colossians 3:5   Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.   Galatians 5:19  Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,  Romans 13:9  For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”  Luke 18:20   You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’”    To clarify - by the wrong way I mean, I'm an atheist in polyamorous relationships who had homosexual oral sex with strangers last night. I don't give a shit about what the bible says is a sin. I'm just very confused about how anyone could reconcile swinging, and being an adherent of that particular doctrine."

We are all more than just one thing. Even more fundamentally than being a mom, you are a woman. A woman who had sex in order to become a mom. Therefore, you are both--a mom AND a woman with sexual desires and needs. One does not negate the other.   The only way to get past it is to face your fears and just do it. The worst that happens is you don't enjoy it and that's the end of it, and you can go back to just being the way things are now.   Or maybe you'll absolutely love it, and if you're like most people who get into the lifestyle it will turbo charge your sexual self and sex drive, including with your husband, and drive your marriage and sex life to new heights that you never dreamed possible.

Swingers,3dkqxn,twoormoretotango,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:00:22 2015 UTC,"First - its NORMAL to have fears, inhibitions, etc. So accept that. This is Mrs. Tango speaking, I had a very conservative background and it was really hard to ""let go"" and enjoy our first time, even though it was G/G only with the guys watching. But a couple of pieces of advice: 1. Think of this as YOUR sex life, as in you and your Hubby. You're involving others, but think of them as, say, really high end sex toys. ;) Your play with others is just another form of you and your Hubby's sex play. 2. Go slow. Maybe tell the other wifey, OK, I'm really nervous about this, I have my long time build up societal inhibition I need to break through - can we go slow? Maybe the first time, we just make out? No expectation past that? My first play GF told me, we will go as slow as you want, we have all the time in the world. Just make out, perhaps there will be some extra hand action, maybe not.  3. I will bet that the making out will be hot, but you will still maybe feel pangs of guilt. Remind yourself again, sex is good, it's fun, hell you wouldn't BE a mom if not for sex! It's natural and there's no cheating if Hubby is involved/agrees. 4. Then just go forward as you're comfortable. A good partner will be more than willing to go slow with you. Just a step at a time. And being women, yeah we can ""logic"" ourselves that there's nothing wrong but our emotive side will take some time to calm down.   Good luck!"

It sounds more like you are describing an open relationship rather than swinging, where partners are free to date and pursue others outside of the coupling. Many swingers only swing together, like my wife and I do. Neither of us ever feel the need to pursue anything away from one another. We are best friends and any friends we make in the lifestyle will be friends of us both so why would we ever need to be apart (Unless it is a decidedly girly manicure trip or something like that, which I can pass on.)"

I am definitely not familiar with polygamy so I don't really know how all that goes and works, but just like being a single guy, I think it is going to be harder to find one on ones as a guy where the partner isn't looking for something just slightly deeper than just sex.   But that is only from my perspective."
Swingers,3dhznc,emmett419,2,Thu Jul 16 13:11:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.   Before we started swinging, my wife gave me the OK for a one-time fling, which I did not use.

If this is the case and everything else in your relationship is solid, I say its like that first crest of a roller-coaster. Staring down at the ground far below that will soon be hurtling towards you much faster than your rational brain tells you it should be. Its normal to feel that way. Once you are off the roller-coaster, with your crazy hair and wild eyes, often times you can't wait to do it again.   BUT... it really depends on what you WANT to do in the end.

Do YOU want to have a threesome with you, your girl, and this other girl first? If the answer is yes, then communicate that with your girl and this other woman. If you don't, then continue on.   It sounds like your girl is nonmonogamous, so you really shouldn't have any anxiety about it ruining your relationship. If she's done this thing before and she's encouraging you to participate, that is a clear signal that your relationship is healthy and this won't go south.  Now, the next thing I say is more important than anything anyone else in here will say.....  You are already nervous and anxious and unsure about things. Do you know what this means? Yep, this means your penis will fail. Buy some pills to prevent this. I don't care if you're 18 or 30 and have never had a failure before.

I think you would be good to try advertising as a couple on OKC and Tinder if you aren't afraid someone you know will see your posts. As others have said bars and clubs are also not a bad way to go, but then you need to be in bars and clubs a lot and be ready to seal the deal if you can. This is hard for people with kids or that don't want to be in a bar every night, so dating sites might generate a few hits.  I would second what others have said about singles in the LS.

If you like to dance, a dance club probably would be best as dancing allows close contact and can break down barriers to intimacy. If not dancing any place that has a good crowd that has more of a party scene then people isolated at their tables and booths.

Each couple gets an MFF experience, much fun can be had and it seems fairly straightforward since no one is really getting left out.

How can I tell if she's really interested in me though? She gives me a lot of compliments and nice touches but lots of girls have done that to me before..."
Swingers,3dg1vl,JandSswings,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:00:24 2015 UTC,I'd be amenable to DW playing with another couple without me. We're out there but I realize we're kind of rare. Try the hotwife lifestyle site and subs. You may have luck there.
Swingers,3dg1vl,bigfoot0110,2,Thu Jul 16 01:37:31 2015 UTC,"What is hotwife? I'm sorry, totally new to all this stuff but willing to learn!"
Swingers,3dg1vl,bigfoot0110,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:46:25 2015 UTC,Sorry for the delayed response! A hotwife is a wife who sleeps with other men with her husband's permission. Contrast with swinging where usually both husband and wife are always involved in the actual sex. In the swinging lifestyle you're less likely to find a couple where the woman will play without her partner. If you look at the hotwife lifestyle you'll find women who like to play on the side without their husband so easier to fulfill your MFF desires with you and your husband.   Edit to add: Just to be clear hot wives are in that lifestyle to get fucked by other men but involving a woman as well is common. So you will need to be comfortable sharing your husband. If you want the other woman to just play with you and not your husband (e.g. Your husband only fucks you) then hot wives probably wouldn't be interested. I know my wife is in that category. She loves playing with women but not exclusively. She'd expect to play with and get fucked by your husband as well.
Swingers,3dg1vl,219throwaway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:32:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the response!  That's exactly what we are looking for. I want my husband to have sex with the other woman,  definitely."

Swingers,3dg1vl,Harry_Teak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:16:36 2015 UTC,"Not a bad thing at all.  If you stick with swinger sites I would suggest opening yourselves up to same room or soft swap situations, you might be surprised at how much fun they can be.  If that's definitely a no go you need to teach your wife how to pick up women.  This situation usually works a lot better coming from them."
Swingers,3dg1vl,Harry_Teak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:54:27 2015 UTC,"I am the wife.  Neither of us would enjoy any sort of swap. I really don't want to be with any men, other than my husband. He's trying to teach me how to flirt with women, and man, dudes have it hard! I didn't realize how easy I had it.   Thanks for the advice though."
Swingers,3dg1vl,Harry_Teak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:44:58 2015 UTC,"Man I apparently need to learn how to read.  I'm not quite sure how I missed that you're the female half of the couple.  Depending on how you define it, soft swap could mean that just the girls play and you don't do anything with the men.  You obviously need to work it out beforehand and it will be difficult to find couples that are looking for this or will agree to it but they are out there."
Swingers,3dg1vl,Harry_Teak,2,Fri Jul 17 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"It's okay, I write for a living and had to check to be sure I hadn't said I was male.  Thanks for all the advice.

I'm worried I might not like one of members of the couple or be uncomfortable.  I've only dated and had sex with men and to be honest, most of my relationships ended because the guy would become super attached to me. I'm attractive and have a nice personality, but it was like after seeing each other for a while, then having sex a few times they would become ULTRA CLINGY and it would turn me off.  I admit I'm somewhat worried about this.  I don't want to sound full of myself, but before I met my husband and was in the dating scene, I guess, even men who were friends/acquaintances would confess their feelings to me. I don't want this to happen if we ever end up being with a couple."

My wife was very nervous but it just took her jumping in and trying it. Infact Saturday we are doing our first mfmf it's been 5 years since we started it takes time patience, COMMUNICATION,  and understanding.  And if your worried about feelings look for commited couples that are experienced to them your another night of fun they don't care so much about knowing you as playing"
Swingers,3dg1vl,plas_ticity,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:56 2015 UTC,"You'd probably have the best luck finding another ""soft swap"" couple who is only looking for girl/girl, where you play with your own husbands and the ladies play with one another. If that's an option it's certainly more likely.   My issue is this, most of the research I've done says swingers and people in the lifestyle hate this type of couple. Is there no hope for us?   This type of couple is only problematic, at least for me, if (1) they are disingenuous about what they are looking for or (2) they don't have consideration for the desires of the third person. In my experience (1) occurs either at sex clubs where we're talking to another couple, things escalate, and then the unicorn-hunting couple tries to shut out the husband from the other couple. It's not really fair to drop that only after the sex has started, and there needs to be communication if that's what you're looking for. Or, if the female half of the couple is communicating with single ladies looking for girl/girl play, and then sort of sneaks in ""oh and you'll be banging my husband too"" late in the game without even asking if she's actually interested in that.  I've found that (2) happens often if the couple wants FFM because of insecurities and sexual hangups and they're so obsessed with finding someone who will fit their narrow definition of what they want as a couple that they forget that the third is a person with their own needs and desires."

Best advice I can give is if she isn't up for it drop the idea or her... its really not kool going behind someone's back.  Good luck man!"
Swingers,3demk6,219throwaway,9,Wed Jul 15 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with emmett. Different people are into different things and so if you are not getting what you want it would be best to probably move on.   Also, I'm not sure why you are describing a softer, more sensual encounter as an emotional thing. Just because a guy wants to give you a deep kiss or run his hands along a sexy body, what part of those are driven by emotion? Guys like to kiss, it gets the blood flowing. Guys like to touch a sexy, smooth, warm body. It enhances the passion, just like for you being choked or slapped sharpens the sexual excitement. Its just different, but I don't see any emotional attachment trying to be faked from his end."
Swingers,3demk6,NerdyandDirty4fun,3,Wed Jul 15 18:16:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that it's necessarily an emotional thing, just that, for me, it's not a dynamic that I can sustain with someone for whom I do not have feelings. That's just me of course. For him it's certainly just part of what turns him on.  It's like this. There's a lot of softness and kissing and caressing from the beginning, which is fine for me as a warm up. So there's a lot of building and building but it never culminates in a payoff for me because it doesn't escalate to hard, animalistic sex. So I feel like I want something to push me over that edge but it never does. So I start to feel frustrated. Then while I'm experiencing that frustrated sensation he wants to hold me tight and kiss me passionately and I'm not on a place where I can relax and enjoy and reciprocate. It's like, get your tongue off my ear. Get your mouth off my neck. And I'm over stimulated in a bad way and at that point, we've been fucking for a while, it's been real, but now I am DONE. Either it needs to escalate so I can start cumming or I just want to stop having sex. But there are three other people who are super into this dynamic, both husbands last basically forever, and I just want to have my body back to myself and I can't."
Swingers,3demk6,emmett419,3,Wed Jul 15 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"I hear you.  My wife likes long, slow, gentle, and not necessarily a lot of PIV sex. I like fast and hard, and rough but not violent. The best situation, when we swing, is to find a complementary couple where we each get what we want. And we've had some very good luck with that.  Your situation is a textbook example of ""taking one for the team"". If it isn't working for you, I think you need to either talk to your husband about this (have you?) and end it, or talk with the other guy and fix it. I can appreciate that doing this in the middle of a vacation with them is not the right time. So how about this: Talk to the guy right now, on vacation, and see if things improve. If they don't, plan your escape post-vacation."
Swingers,3demk6,NerdyandDirty4fun,2,Wed Jul 15 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's taking one for the team necessarily, because I'm having fun up to a point. I just arrive at a threshold a lot sooner than they do. And I think I took for granted how much the reclamation sex with my husband plays into my enjoyment with them. Maybe I can get my husband to swap back to me for a little bit when I'm ready to climax.   Honestly I'm not too worried about what will happen after this trip. I'm willing to communicate with this guy, I'm just not sure how to put it without creating a tense situation for the remainder of this trip."
Swingers,3demk6,enoughwiththebread,3,Wed Jul 15 20:06:02 2015 UTC,"It does sound frustrating, especially if you aren't getting your orgasms. As the male half of our swinger couple, I would hate not getting my partner her orgasm and if there were something I could ramp up to to ensure that culmination, I would always be willing to do that. I would talk to them about it, maybe your husband first, and then the other husband."
Swingers,3demk6,enoughwiththebread,3,Wed Jul 15 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"Has the other husband actually said he has feelings for you, or are you inferring that from his style of having sex? It may be that what you consider ""emotional"" or ""feelings"" activities, he just considers part of the things that turn him on when having sex.    For instance, I personally also enjoy deep kissing and caressing during sex even with a play partner I have no emotional attachment to, because it turns me on.   That said, I'm also up for animalistic, rough sex if the woman I'm with indicates that she wants to go that way, because that can be fun too. Have you communicated that that's what you're into and what you want? If not, then you can't expect the guy to be a mind reader, you have to tell him what you want.  This lifestyle is all about open and honest communication, that's the only way it works for everyone. And the same applies to your swap partners."

I don't think that he has feelings for me, but on my end, I need more of a connection if there's going to be a lot of that stuff. I can deal with some here and there but not the whole entire time. It becomes exhausting.   Have you communicated that that's what you're into and what you want? If not, then you can't expect the guy to be a mind reader, you have to tell him what you want.   Yes, clearly and verbally. But he can only be rough in short spurts it seems. I get on top as needed too."
Swingers,3demk6,jollycooperation420,2,Wed Jul 15 19:04:35 2015 UTC,"OK, then if you've communicated your needs clearly to him and he is not providing what you need, then he is clearly not a suitable play partner for you."

On the other, you enjoy rough sex which he isn't providing (or maybe can't), and you don't like the emotional part. From what you've written, it isn't clear to me why this is working for you at all. It sounds like the sex is merely tolerable.  You also say that you enjoy this other couple out of bed as well. If that's true, and the relationship is worth putting effort into, then just talk about your issues, see if he is willing to do things differently. If not, then is the discussion really worth the effort? Just say goodbye and move on."
Swingers,3demk6,the_real_t,2,Wed Jul 15 18:01:03 2015 UTC,You're not wrong...we are traveling together right now though so that's why it's pressing at the moment. And honestly that may be what's exacerbating the issue since it hasn't previously been an issue.
Swingers,3demk6,romikk32,2,Wed Jul 15 19:23:57 2015 UTC,"MY simple take on this is that you are not sexually very compatible. It happens even when there IS an emotional connection. If you don't enjoy it you should just tell him, it might bum him out, he might not what you want, and it might end things, but at least you're not engaging in an activity that gets you down to the point you are asking people for advice. You should be having fun."

Although I've never done it, a surprising number of people use Craigslist successfully.  You could also give /r/swingersr4r a shot.  Swinger Events:  There are a number of swinger events you can find on these swinging websites.  Some allow sex on site (on-premise) while others are more about just socializing with other swingers.  Bars: Assuming you're in college, you may have luck going to a college bar and just being open about what you guys are looking for.      Regardless of where you end up looking, make sure you guys have communicated with each other exactly what you do and do not want, and be direct about this with the other couple."

Swingers,3de82u,Emohay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"We go to Scarlet Ranch semi-often (we live in Denver).  Ok, first of all, it is completely acceptable to only watch and flirt. You'll find a ton of that going on. People, for the most part, are very respectful and they will introduce themselves to you and flirt with you. Typically, nobody will pressure you, but again, there are always exceptions to every rule.   It is a big place. Main floor has the bar (bring your own booze, the bartenders will mix them for you), has eating area, dance floor.  Downstairs is a big play area with lots of beds, some rooms that you can draw curtains on if you don't want people watching, and a few other play areas like a simulated kitchen and such that you can fuck in if that is your thing (cause fucking on kitchen counter is a thing).   Outside is a play area too. They have a heated teepee, a handful of cabanas, etc. Really nice in the summer.  Ok, moving on:  You'll find a wide range of people just like a normal club. You'll see young and fit people, young and fat people, middle aged hot people, middle aged ugly people, old fit people, old ugly people. Old people with extremely young people, etc.   But overall, you'll be well respected and flirted with.  As for days of the week to go. I believe Wednesday is the ""newbie meet and greet"" day. This is where they waive your entrance fee so you can go in there and see what it's like. Now, you'll still need to become a member, which is like $100 or so to even step foot in there, but you won't be charged the additional $100 or so to stay.   Wednesdays are pretty slow. Actually, all days but Friday, Saturday, Sunday are pretty slow with Saturday being by far the busiest.  But you'll meet lots of people either way. Its just that on the slow nights, there may only be 1 or 2 attractive couples there that you'd like (depending on your level of attractiveness I should say).   Lets put it this way... On Wednesday, there will be one or two ""8+"" couples (attractive scale). The rest will be around a 3-7 with the majority hovering in the 5-6 range.  On a Friday, the number of 8+ on attraction scale goes up to probably 5-10 couples.   On Saturday it goes up a lot.  And you'll still have quite a few of the 5-6-7 range couples too.  So there you have it. That's your ""less than 5 minute"" tour of Scarlet Ranch. Its a nice place, but nothing to be intimidated over.   If you have specific questions, ask away."

It might be your age, your weight, your height, your Sexual preference, the color of your hair or the color of your skin.  But for everyone who isn't attracted to you, someone else will be.  So unless you're under the age of consent, you CAN swing - no one is going to tell you that you can't, jUst don't be offended if someone says you're not their type.  There are people who shouldn't get involved in swinging - fortunately they find out pretty quickly that it isn't for them, and they go away by themselves."

Just like you want no one over 30, some couples won't want anyone in your age group. It just depends. Hopefully more young people stay swinging, but until then it's hit or miss. Just like when other couples find out they are out of your age range."

Swingers,3d936v,randomlurkerhere,3,Tue Jul 14 13:35:55 2015 UTC,"Cups with lids! Outside of your generic ""Make sure you have your rules clearly defined"" and ""Don't take one for the team"" that are standard bits of wisdom ANY time you are swinging, my best piece of advice is to bring one or two of those hard plastic cups with screw on lids and a straw. No, this is not because of any kind of concern about a drink getting spiked, but it can be a real saving grace when you are on the dance floor or if the club is real crowded. There is nothing worse than getting your arm bumped and dumping an ice cold drink down your front.   Other than that, don't be a wall flower. I know a club can be kind of an intimidating experience for your first time but get out there and meet people. I can't tell you how many times I meet people and they ask me what club I go to here in the Dallas area and when I tell them I hear how cliqueish the club I go to is. It really isn't. Swingers are people too and when you go to a club as often as these regulars do, they tend to find easy conversation to engage in because they are just as intimidated by the couples sitting on the walls as the couples on the wall are."
Swingers,3d936v,NerdyandDirty4fun,2,Tue Jul 14 13:47:38 2015 UTC,Dude. The cup thing. Didn't even think that. Plus the whole spiking thing too.

With that in mind, go with no expectations and just have fun. Mingle, mingle, mingle!  Don't expect people to talk to you, go and introduce yourselves if you find someone interesting in the crowd.  Don't be afraid of inserting yourself into a conversation if 2 couple are talking and you want to meet one of them.    They might just thank you for saving them.    One more tip, dress up nicely but don't over do it with slut wear or costumes. Most ladies just look like they are going out to the club, no special attire required."

Better to say be flexible with your expectations and have an open mind.  Experience what's happening instead of trying to make something happen.  Our first time to a club, we thought it would be soooooo erotic and just a sexually charged atmosphere.  I actually thought I might have to step over or around someone copulating in the hallway.  I was way wrong.  Instead, aside from the stripper pole in the middle of the dance floor and the occasional pornographic art on the walls, you wouldn't have known you weren't at a vanilla office party or something.  Everyone kinda kept to themselves and spoke quietly, got up every once in a while to get drinks, etc.  It was like that for two and a half hours before anything sexual happened at all.  We were just sitting there in awe, because our minds couldn't wrap around how this completely normal situation could possibly evolve to what we knew was coming.  And when it did come, it was way more tame than what we expected.  We walked down into the play area, and one of the rooms had some grunting noises, and in the dim light, you could kinda make out that there were two body-shapes in there, and that maybe they had their clothes off, but you couldn't really see anything, and without the soundtrack and alternating camera shots, it turned out to be the most boring porn we ever watched.    But we still ended up having a good time.  It just was something completely different from what we expected.  So, keep an open mind and just take it as it comes."
Swingers,3d936v,flwrsme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:53:17 2015 UTC,I guess I never really imagined this.

The place we are going has lockers but I am trying to bring as little as possible. Our plan is honestly just to observe and be voyeurs, with maybe some play between ourselves. We aren't swingers nor are we both into the idea of swapping, but getting down with another couple would certainly be on the table, so I know we need to be prepared for that. Plus having a little alcohol with us as a social lubricant.   But with all this talk about cups with lids and sandals I just don't know where it's all going to fit unless we are bringing luggage with us to the club."

If you're asking do I personally think single people can be swingers, my answer is no, but that doesn't stop us from playing with single men, and sometimes women, at swinging events.

Sometimes it is a hotel, sometimes a bar. Everyone there is in the LS, but rules on nudity and play vary from event to event. If it is a bar usually a block of rooms are available at a hotel nearby. Generally the organizers of the event handle admission to ensure a good balance of single males etc. Some are more well organized than others. This is different from a meet and greet where vanillas are also present."

Some are singles, some are nudists, some are there just to watch or be watched, some just like the energy.  A takeover is swingers (maybe a few SMs and SFs)  A takeover can also happen at a vanilla venue or resort. Take over implies that the host has secured a space for us to take over.  In 2010 we went to the Hard Rock Hotel takeover, swingers had an entire tower and there were badges and security to get in.  In 2011 we did one in Cabo, the entire vanilla resort, one that you can bring your kids to, was closed for bookings for a week. We took it over. On the first day families were checking out while swingers were checking in."

This will be our first time at Naughty so we aren't 100% sure what to expect either. We have been to the Vegas Exchange in Las Vegas and we assume it is something like that. Seminars, classes, and guest speakers will probably do stuff during the day if I get the gist of things, though the schedule has not been finalized yet. Then their will be some theme parties at night. I don't think it is a full takeover of the hotel so we will have to dress appropriately into the parties, I think. There should also be some play rooms open and themed for the public. Kind of like going to a swingers club but without having to worry about driving home after a night of drinking."
Swingers,3d6n79,NerdyandDirty4fun,3,Tue Jul 14 13:01:21 2015 UTC,"We went last year and had a blast! An absolute must is attending the day time parties. They were by far the best events. The theme nights were a lot of fun too. Don't be afraid to talk to people and get to know them. It was great that everyone you talked to you was a swinger. We met so many great people. We only went to one breakout session be we just couldn't get up early enough for them after being up so late ;) the playrooms were gorgeous but it was hard to find room. We played almost exclusively in our room or ""their"" rooms. We wanted to book for this year immediately! Any specific questions that I can answer?"

These place practically hose you down with cheap alcohol and it gets really wild. Like sex in public kind of wild.  There are also conference meetings all day -- we never attended one so we don't know what they're like. I believe I will be speaking at the social media tech meeting this time around.  There's a theme party every night. These things are absolutely huge, elaborate and a lot of fun. Enormous dance floor, good DJs, etc.  We never made it to the playrooms but we heard they were pretty amazing. We'll get there this year for sure.  As for what you'll see -- About what you would expect to see at swinger club. The crowd will tend to skew a little older -- more 40s and up than 30s and up.

Swingers,3d5mgn,ajdlwP,6,Mon Jul 13 18:36:12 2015 UTC,"A couple of things jump out here - you were in more of a poly relationship than a swinging relationship.  While I have nothing against poly relationships, these are the sort of  problems I constantly hear from them, and you might get better advice in one of the subreddits dedicated to that type of relationship.  Secondly, the kind of advice you're seeking seems to be more like general relationship advice - just because you're in a non-monogamous relationship, it doesn't mean you can't get general relationship advice.  Issues of trust, infidelity and deceit, are things you probably should seek professional help for, rather than asking Reddit, which leads to my final point, since your asked for it.  I get the feeling that your wife did cheat on you.  If she didn't feel guilty about what happened, why did it take five days for it to come up?  If she had nothing to hide, you would have heard about it earlier.  Your friend was an ad for lying to your spouse, but she obviously knew something wasn't right, because she hid it from you."

Because it would be my wife that I have the most trust in, and she should have confirmed that this was okay before she did it.  If she purposely withheld what happened I'd have to ask why. If I had to draw my own conclusion, it'd be because she thought it was wrong or her. He didn't get her drunk, she chose to drink."

It's possible she made up his lies herself after the fact because she went ahead and did what she wanted to do. Or they agreed on a story together, or something.  You'll never know the whole truth unfortunately. And it sounds like you had a lot of predefined rules, possibly too many. Too many rules don't make you more comfortable, they actually just create more failure modes for somebody to violate trust in the heat of the moment. If you're ok with solo play then you need to be ok with solo play. Forget all this, if x y and z conditions are met, because you are setting up a situation where she is gonna disappoint you.  For us, our rule is solo play with couples only, when it's on the table for both of us."

You just have to respect that she likes what she likes.   I mean, it's OK to talk to her & get her point of view on the situation and maybe have her explain it so you understand it better - maybe she's not as attracted to him as you think, maybe the idea that he's old enough to be her dad turns her off; or maybe she just isn't into the idea of older guys."

Swingers,3d2v3d,jollycooperation420,2,Mon Jul 13 02:36:08 2015 UTC,"Everyone has a different approach towards swinging. Some go specifically after physical attractiveness. Some go more for personality. And there is a whole continuum in between.  My wife is more about physical attractiveness whereas I'm more attracted to personality. To me, older, younger, different races, are all interesting to me, if she is a nice and we have chemistry, it's an opportunity to be with somebody total new and intersting.  My wife on the other hand definitely has a specific ""type"" that she is attracted to.  You could try putting it to her that way, that it might actually be fun, something totally different, and the worst case scenario is that it's just not mindblowing and you don't have to repeat it with them. Maybe she'll come around, maybe not. ""I don't know he is kinda old"" isn't a firm no, sounds like she is on the fence, maybe you can give her a different perspective on things to broaden her standards a little bit."
Swingers,3d2v3d,NWBoomer,2,Mon Jul 13 03:03:26 2015 UTC,"This is funny, we didn't even start swinging until we were in our 50's. Anyone our kids age or younger are too young for us to play with.

I'm not talking anything actually bad, more along the lines of they may stop talking to you etc.   If your wife isn't interested, she isn't interested. Lots of people would have an issue fucking someone who's old enough to be their father. Even if everything else seems great (chemistry, looks, youthfulness in attitude and appearance), you simply can't take away the ""he's old enough to be my dad."" perspective. It would be like a 50 year old couple not fucking an 18 year old because their daughter is also 18 and although that couple might be amazing, they just simply won't go there."

It sucks to be us, but WE were the exact same way when we were late 20's and 40 year olds came onto us, and by we I mean me, something about an older woman just didn't do it for me.  Now that I'm a mid 40 I could say I've changed but thats a lie. Just like I wasn't looking for a 45 at 35, I'm not looking for a 55 at 45.

We're a late 30's couple and got together with an mid 50's couple (I think they both look much younger).   I Knew their ages, but decided to not tell me wife and just show her their pics. She wanted to meet them so we did, and played together on our first date. It went so well, we had a second date and that's when she learned their ages. My wife was surprised, but still interested in meeting/playing with this couple, as am I.   I think age is really just a number and it's one of those things that society is way too hung up on."

Assuming she wasn't just going along, which is very bad if that's the case, then why the age line when discussing penetration but not tongues?  I'm sure there's more to this and that's fine, but I'm a big fan of just saying there's no attraction instead of falling back on an arbitrary age line.  Here's my general use math problem:  open to full swap + attraction + everything that is supposed to work works + opportunity = go for it.  Who cares about the age of an adult?"
Swingers,3d2v3d,Nice-Rapist,4,Mon Jul 13 11:06:26 2015 UTC,It never ceases to amaze me how many people in this subreddit think that their standards should apply equally to everyone.

I can't find where I said it either does or should apply equally to everyone.  It's a statement to generate discussion which I thought was the point here.  Nothing more.  Of course it's up to them - please notice that word ""attraction"".  It encompasses looks, personality, smells, whatever.....and age....and is 100% determined by the individual.  I stand by my ""who cares"" statement because if everything else is in order why does an arbitrarily picked number veto it?  It doesn't make sense especially when in this situation the attraction and age apparently wasn't an issue the first time around.  (Please note that I first said that there may be more to the original post....like maybe she wasn't really attracted and just went along).  Try to tear apart my first statement instead.  Age is not an issue if genitals are being licked but don't bring that wrinkled dick near me?  That doesn't add up.  She has to be comfortable and she has to make that call, but the two different calls seem strange.  If she's not attracted to him just say that.  Don't blame a number.  To the OP, I actually do hope that you both find exactly what you're looking for, whatever that may be, and that both of you are always 100% comfortable with every one you play with."

Swingers,3d2v3d,mrandmrsm,0,Tue Jul 14 00:20:28 2015 UTC,"So, you're allowed to disagree, but if anyone dares to present a counter argument you're out.  Got it.  You have a knack for adding meaning where that meaning didn't exist.  You're right in that it doesn't have to add up to you or me, but it should add up to the couple and that's the point I'm trying to get across.  I can't believe that you have such an issue with someone taking an opposite position.  It's not much of a conversation if everyone thinks the same thing.  Saying I don't understand where they're coming from and looking for something to help me understand is not judging.  It's critical thinking and more people should try it.  Being new to reddit, I wasn't clear that OPs or those looking to validate them were simply looking for backup but you've straightened me out and I'll try to do more observing than commenting.  I think we've pretty well beat the hell out of this horse, so I will now step away and leave this sub to the nicest rapist I've ever come across.

I'm not sure how their age factors in if you have a good connection and the couple is attractive.  It does appear that some give age much greater power than others do. To each their own I guess.

Although when we had to move during an emergency situation it was quite the talk of the family when I forgot it was on the bed as they helped us move lol.

Swingers,3d2agk,iloura,2,Mon Jul 13 02:58:44 2015 UTC,"We had this same issue, stated we were looking for a long term fwb type relationship. It turned out they weren't as interested in me as he was interested in finding another stunt cock to make his girlfriend happy. They were incredibly self centered and had NO idea how to be team players in the bedroom. I ghosted on them when they repeatedly called expecting ""one of us"" to come over for booty calls because they were only interested in threesomes. The male half texted me out of the blue a week or two ago and never said why but pretty sure his gf wanted my husband's cock again (he's hung). NOPE."
Swingers,3d2fic,Transgenderswinger,3,Sun Jul 12 23:57:58 2015 UTC,"My wife and I both used to be pretty jealous.  I think we have both kind of moved on from most jealousy issues. We can actually have a more oprn, non judgemental discussion about what we want, like, think about, etc when it comes to sex.   I also feel like we've had a fun adventure together.  Even if we stopped tomorrow,  I'm glad we dared to do something a little wild and off the beaten path. :)"
Swingers,3d2fic,FeetInTheWater,3,Mon Jul 13 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"We just started out, but I can already tell that this will help with jealousy. I've been quite a jealous person, tbh, and the tought of my partner hooking up with another girl was really scary. At our first club experience I saw him going down on a lady - and was surprised about how ok I was with that! Not only was I happy for him, I've been getting off on the thought later ;)  I can also second the point on communication. We have talked and talked and talked beforehand and after, and are already much more open and honest with each other when it comes to our realtionship. And sex.   So far it's all good :)"
Swingers,3d2fic,SwingingFinns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:22:52 2015 UTC,That is awesome! My wife and I have played with other guys involved (MFM not MMF). She has gotten to the point that all she fantasies about is me with another girl. But when we get to the point of bringing another girl in she gets cold feet for fear of what might happen with her jealousy. Mind you I'm not pushing for another girl at all it really is all for her. I find the other way plenty exciting. I'm confident her experience would match yours perfectly but we just haven't taken that step. I will have to show her your comment! Thanks!
Swingers,3d2fic,00rainman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:13:57 2015 UTC,"Well, happy if I can help :)  Maybe you could look into playing with another couple? The girl my partner was pleasuring was the female half of a couple, not a single gal - not sure if that made a difference?   I'm not saying I'm completely ""cured"" of any jealousy based on just one experience, but at least in that context it was really ok. I'm hoping to get to the point where we could even play separately on occasion with no issues.  Best of luck to you!"
Swingers,3d2fic,SwingingFinns,2,Sun Jul 19 01:39:57 2015 UTC,"My wife and I started in the lifestyle both very young and very early in our relationship. We started swinging after dating for 6 months when she was 19 and I was 24 so we didn't have to go through any major changes in those regards.   But there have been changes that we have made.   1) Going from having younger children to older children. We got having kids out of the way and now as they are getting older it is getting easier and easier to go out. That being said, we swing so much more in the last 3-4 years than we ever did when we first started.   2) Meeting Via Website to meeting in person. We do still use the sites to strike up conversations still, but we don't use them anymore to exclusively meet other swingers. Over time we have found that the chemistry with couples we meet online can be not so great. Often times we find that their pictures are misrepresented or that they are too new and nervous. Meeting in person allows us to immediately gauge the chemistry level and the interest level and we have had so much more fun swinging this way.   3) Swinger Vacations. We have started taking at least one swinger vacation a year where we go to a swingers oriented event or take-over. For us, these experiences have been amazing in a way that swinging at home can't match. Instead of breaking up your fun between weekends or what-not, we've had 4-7 days of swinger fun all packed together and surrounded by people who are just like us. For us it has been a very addictive experience.   4) Getting More Social. This one has been and can still be a challenge. While my wife is easily social and flamboyant, I can be something of an introvert. It is a battle, but slowly over time I have fought to let my more charming and social side out of its shell which is critical in the lifestyle.   5) Fitness. I know this may seem more like a physical change, but I assure you it can also be very mental. While my wife has always been pretty petite, I have lost around 70 pounds over the course of a couple years (mostly because holidays tend to set me back just a bit and I have to play catch up). This makes a big difference to my confidence levels, which in turn affects my ability to get out there and open up more."
Swingers,3d2fic,NerdyandDirty4fun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:37:17 2015 UTC,"We had gotten to the point that we realized we wanted very different things sexually. This, combined with 25 years of monogamy let to boredom and frustration. Swinging has fixed all this. We have sex with other people who are more compatible sexually, so that reduces frustration. The novelty has been wonderful. And we bring home our new experiences, so sex between us is better than it has been in a very long time."
Swingers,3d0qcq,Transgenderswinger,11,Sun Jul 12 15:24:29 2015 UTC,"Anything is ok in the swinging community, but bear in mind people are attracted to what they're attracTed to.  It's out off the normal, so you'll probably find that more people are turned off by the idea than turned on, so it's important to take that in stride rather than hold it against anyone."
Swingers,3d0qcq,Nice-Rapist,3,Sun Jul 12 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"It's not a problem for me, or in my community.   However, I've come across some very sex-negative attitudes at larger open/public swinger events, which resulted in me feeling sketched out and uncomfortable, and people weren't even commenting on me.   I'd say, do your homework to find some safe communities near you. It might take a while, but I'm sure you'll be able to find them. It also might take looking at a lot of different websites than the more popular ones: maybe take a look at Fetlife, or OkCupid (start by finding individual couples), yahoo groups, etc?"

Swingers,3d0qcq,jollycooperation420,6,Sun Jul 12 22:40:04 2015 UTC,"What do you think of transgender women swinging?   An attractive (traditionally attractive / fem woman with a dick) is secretly on my bucket list. Or maybe not so secretly since my LS friends know my reddit handle . . .   Have you been to an event with one   I don't know honestly. If so I didn't find out.   Is it ok to swing as a trans women in the swinging community.   Who gives a shit, I do what I want.   Generally what is your view of trans women in the swinging community.   That I don't know. Swinging isn't a homogeneous community. You have uber liberals and bible thumbers. You have racists and homophobes and you have SJWs and LGBT. Even within close groups you have different rules of swinging that vary with each couple. There is no consensus anywhere really.   Lastly would you have any advice for a trans woman who wants to swing?   Go for it? Be 100% honest, don't try and trap anyone, be as conventionally attractive as you can be, be very polite and personable, and you'll probably have a lot of success. Swinging is an opportunity for people in committed relationships to try new things. You're definitely going to be a new thing for a lot of people.   The downside is, try to avoid becoming a commodity. You might feel used at times. Be selective, be smart, don't put yourself in dangerous situations if you're flying solo. Go on vanilla dates with couples first, sniff them out, protect yourself."
Swingers,3d0qcq,glitch83,2,Mon Jul 13 03:22:45 2015 UTC,Transgender FtM OR MtF is a rare plus for us. You probably want to find a Bi couple - they'd probably be more open to it.   .. this of course doesn't mean it's a swing and a hit - chemistry is still the biggest factor for us regardless!

We are a straight couple but were approached online by a transexual woman. I don't consider myself bicurious at all but am definitely curious about this experience. I do find it a bit odd that such an open-minded community has a bit of a bias against bisexual men and I wonder how much that extends to tgirls. Curious how many couples here have experienced something like this. I could imagine if there's a 3 way Ttraction this could be the best of all worlds..."
Swingers,3d0qcq,HotWifeEcho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:30:56 2015 UTC,"My GF and I are bi so this would be something we would welcome. As others have said be open about it and I am sure you will be fine and attract a lot of attention.   There is some homophobia in the LS, there is no doubt about that and the thought of a trans woman would probably be too much for some. But there are also a lot of guys who identify as straight who are more bi-curious than they would ever admit in an online profile. I am sure they would be very curious about you.   As far as advice, I would just make sure YOU know what you are looking to get out of the experience and what kind of people you would like to experience that with. Once you know that about yourself you can set rules and boundaries for yourself that will ensure you are safe and comfortable and can focus on having fun. Check out the sidebar for sites you can use to connect with people and if you share where you are located people here can point you to a good one for your location. Good luck"

If people aren't attracted to me then they aren't attracted to me, whatever. I don't know if people would be likely to react violently or anything though.

Swingers,3d0qcq,kitanokikori,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:46:09 2015 UTC,"I'll probably get blasted but isn't that the way that many transgenders say that they figured out that they were trans? The statement usually goes something like, ""my body shows male but I was female inside"". Inside what? Their mind, thoughts, ""heart"", etc. CHK asked a legitimate question about what the OP was meaning by transgender woman.   Is it really necessary to be offended when someone phrases something oddly even when it is clear from the context that there was no malice intended?"
Swingers,3d0qcq,mrbigmrssexy,3,Mon Jul 13 22:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that, regardless of OPs intent, a reasonable person would read that phrase with a dismissive / derisive tone (i.e. ""You're not really who you say you are""), punching a shoulder that is almost certainly very sore already.   Not to mention, OP does not actually need to know this about the actual poster in question. A better question to ask would be, ""If I'm at a party, what would be a polite way for me to ask someone similar what activities we can/can't participate in, and if I'm not interested in what that person can offer, how can I decline while not hurting their feelings"""
Swingers,3d0qcq,temswingcouple,0,Tue Jul 14 02:35:54 2015 UTC,"Though it looks like you are confusing the OP with CHK (who made the statement in response to the OP), it does matter the intent. Because the question was posed only to the OP by CHK concerning what the OP was meaning by trans woman. As CHK pointed out, it would matter whether it was a MTF or FTM.  If CHK was at a party and the subject came up, I seriously doubt that he would be as callous as you want to make him out to be. As for hurting someone's feelings with rejection, the rejector rarely has any control over the rejectee's feelings, even in the best of rejections."

I ask this because my wife and I have found the websites very frustrating and we live in Dallas where we have a very successful, very active lifestyle community. Still, we find that we seldom meet people off the websites. Not only that, but the couples that we HAVE met on the websites have been a very mixed bag. They can range from fun to downright awkward or worse.   So for us, while we know that the club scene is not for everyone, we certainly enjoy meeting people in person right from the get go. You can find out what there preferences and rules are and you have a really good chance to get a feel for the chemistry. But that is our experience with it."
Swingers,3d2po4,texascpl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:30:20 2015 UTC,"We are also in Dallas and have noticed the same thing.  If you don't get out that much, meeting people from sdc or whatever is frustrating because there can be so many issues which cause your night to basically be wasted - it's a lot better to meet people at a club or party.  But it also seems like there's a whole group of people who don't go to the clubs or only go to certain parties so you really have to get around in order to meet a lot of people."
Swingers,3d2po4,NerdyandDirty4fun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:55:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah the website mentality blows our mind sometimes. Basically, you have to be ready to take the initiative if you are going to meet anyone on the websites, especially on SLS. SDC is the same but I have found recently that when I sign up for an event or list us on Speed Dating our inbox blows up, which seems to be backwards, lol."
Swingers,3d2po4,texascpl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:02:51 2015 UTC,"I kinda think its the same as the clubs really, if you are picky in the slightest you need to be ready to make the moves, or else you will get who comes to you.  Very rarely has it happened in the clubs that the couple we were thinking we would go flirt with flirted with us first.  Usually its someone that we need to back away from.  Don't know why that is but it just seems to be reality."
Swingers,3d2po4,NerdyandDirty4fun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:16:36 2015 UTC,"You are right on target with that, we agree. The benefit with doing it at the club is that you can see who it is you are really talking to, rather than a 5-10 year old picture. It's also a great way to test out the chemistry before hand. We do have standards that have to be met and we do have to casually avoid some couples sometimes as well, but our nights out tend to be much more fulfilling when spent at a club rather than meeting someone from a website."

Swingers,3d0vkp,TGE123,3,Sun Jul 12 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"These are events where single men are not allowed and the dress code is lingerie, burlesque or similar. Most people are between 20 and 40 and are not overweight. We really loved the atmosphere, people and the erotic vibe. Kissing, touching and slight playing with other is allowed in the kind of erotic events and over 50% of the public are swingers (as most are sponsored by SDC) but there are no playrooms and dancing is the main thing.   Tell me more about these parties.  Where?"
Swingers,3d0vkp,STL-MO-CPL,2,Sun Jul 12 21:49:37 2015 UTC,"We visited the playrooms. Our expectation was passionate sex. The kind with lots of touching, kissing, and really spoiling each other.   Maybe this comes down to when you were observing. My wife and I are very much into the foreplay BUT a lot of that foreplay happens on the dance floor or outside of the play rooms. Frequently, once the chemistry has been established so will the kissing, the touching, and the grinding. This can continue for quite some time until we are all so worked up that we HAVE to continue in the play rooms. That isn't necessarily the end of the foreplay, but by now we have moved on to naked time and oral play and fucking is right around the corner.   So by the time you go back to the play room to observe, maybe much of the foreplay has already taken place.   Different couples are looking for different experiences and not every experience is going to be the same. While as the male half of our couple, I rather enjoy the slower and softer variety of sex. However, more often that not, I come across the variety of women that very much like it harder and rougher. And because I want to here my partner moan, I give it to them exactly the way the want it.   Also, not every experience is going to be perfect. We have had our share of awkward moments, especially when a couple is new to the experience. But, usually, when the chemistry is perfect, you get a bed of sexy naked people sprawled out in exhausted contentment and softly talking and joking with one another. At least for us that is the usual experience."
Swingers,3d0vkp,NerdyandDirty4fun,2,Mon Jul 13 14:13:00 2015 UTC,We've been to a few swinger events as well and found that they aren't really what we're interested in (Although honestly it sounds like even your experience was better than ours).

Swingers,3d0vkp,joe-ducreux,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:37:10 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Those sound really interesting.  PM us too please if you end up not posting publicly.
Swingers,3d0vkp,DoubleEntendre_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:26:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry that was your experience, but it seems pretty atypical.  We've been to numerous events/clubs and have come across only one instance of drugs - and that was in a hotel after leaving a club.  And bored people in a playroom seems like a very strange occurance.  Not to critique your experience because there may be a lot more context than the note indicates, but one comment kind of sticks out.  ""Hi, love your shoes"" many times means ""Hi, love your shoes"".  It's just a conversation starter to see where things may go.  Nobody is going to have sex if a basic conversation isn't struck up.  That scene may just not be your thing.  Maybe meeting a couple outside of a club environment may be the way to go."
Swingers,3d0vkp,mrandmrsm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"It was also a strange occurrence for us.  I was walking and notice a woman wearing beautiful shoes. I ticked her on her shoulder and told her I loved her shoes. The music was loud, her man asked what I said, and I told him that I loved his wife's shoes. His reply was 'I would love to bang that body of yours'. I did not expect that and his wife just smiled and said, 'I am not into women, but you are definitely his type'.   We had two more of such very direct experiences. In combination with what happened on the couch made us a bit worried to talk to random people. Thinking that perhaps just making contact would translate into we want more.  Would have loved to talk to a couple of people about their experience and how they started. Tips and other things. There was really no place for a basic conversation. Perhaps we were just unlucky with the people we talked to.  Glad that this is atypical. We will try another event by another organization in the future."

Swingers,3d0vkp,tbstexas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:26:00 2015 UTC,"By the way they word it, it was a 'swingers event'? So I am not sure it was a 'club' per se, but I would be interested to know event it was. The drug use is surprising. We have so rarely encountered this and the hardest substance most people we have come across have been marijuana smokers."
Swingers,3d0vkp,Nice-Rapist,-1,Mon Jul 13 13:49:37 2015 UTC,I can't disagree with this more.  Events like the one described aren't swinging... They are events. You can swing without ever clubbing or being around the party.
Swingers,3d0vkp,tbstexas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:13:53 2015 UTC,"Of course.  It wouldn't be /r/ swingers if your weren't disagreeing with someone.  My comment had nothing to do with the club, but what OP appears to want from their encounters, but I'd have better luck explaining that to a brick wall than you and your perpetually negative attitude.  But as usual, thanks for your downvote- like a Number of others have mentioned, they flow freely when you're around."
Swingers,3d0vkp,Nice-Rapist,-1,Wed Jul 15 13:34:41 2015 UTC,OP can get what OP wants from swinging.  I'm not the negative one telling someone to just give up.  The swinging community gathered together annoys the living shit out of us and it's easy to explain why. We want to swing our way and gathering people together statistically means most won't swing our way or be who we want.  So unless you want to swing the way people swing in clubs... Clubs/events are mostly useless.
Swingers,3d0vkp,tbstexas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:39:13 2015 UTC,"Read my fucking post - did I tell them to give up?. No.  I told then sWinging might not be for them, because I feel like they're wanting something more personal in nature.  I could be wrong, but I think they're Looking for more of a poly type deal.  But anyway, nor even sure why I respond to you."
Swingers,3d0vkp,Nice-Rapist,-1,Wed Jul 15 13:46:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, you told them this wasn't for them which is horribly wrong. They just need to find their way within swinging... wanting more passion isn't polyamory. The hard truth for swingers is that the sex they generally have is ridiculously bad jackhammer porn sex that few women actually enjoy. Op saw the bad sex happening and recoiled. It's natural.  As for your problem with me, I don't think you're justified, but I won't deny being blunt either.  I'm just interneting, maybe internet isn't for you?"

Swingers,3d2hwp,bunnykeeper,0,Mon Jul 13 06:28:31 2015 UTC,I approached it by saying that I wasn't getting into a serious relationship if it was going to be strictly monogamous. I brought up swinging and not an open relationship. I have no interest in doing anything without my wife. We got married with that in mind.
Swingers,3d2hwp,NWBoomer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:11:46 2015 UTC,"Reading between the lines it sounds like maybe this is an interest of yours, but not of hers?  Or perhaps you haven't brought it up to her at all yet?  A bit more info would help."
Swingers,3d2hwp,DoubleEntendre_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:34:50 2015 UTC,You're correct on all accounts.  I don't know how to bring this up to her which was kind of my point.  It's like telling a significant other they're getting fat...it's a conversation I just don't know how to have
Swingers,3d2hwp,jollycooperation420,0,Mon Jul 13 04:33:18 2015 UTC,"OK!  Then take the sneaky approach :)  Make up an excuse to watch some porn with her, and while flipping through selections, make sure you 'randomly' choose something swinging-related.  Then just toss out a question, ""Oh, that looks interesting.  What do you think about swinging?""  Or something like that.  Once the topic is on the table, it's much easier to launch into a discussion."
Swingers,3d2hwp,DoubleEntendre_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:29:13 2015 UTC,Generally couple who enter into swinging have been in committed and trusting relationships for a decade or more. In your case I would approach both marrying this woman and entering into swinging with a LOT of forethought.

While that's bringing lots of swingers into town, they're not coming to the club.  But find out what hotel does this.  I know one club has a semi-regular arrangement with a nearby hotel for overnight guests.  with transportation.  This is a good thing, especially in Niagara, where I would expect a larger portion of your clientele would be non-locals.  This would also affect your dynamic as most clubs draw from local swingers.  you need to advertise in whatever serves the Buffalo market the most, because they'll cross the border.  And you need to advertise in Cafe Desire, because in my limited experience they seem to be the go-to place for GTA swingers.  But spread your oats wide my good man because no one website owns the swingers scene.  If you want some people who are experienced in the swingclub scene as consultants (that's not me, but I know some), PM me your contact details and I'll put them in touch with you."

Swingers,3cu0lo,DoubleEntendre_,5,Mon Jul 13 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"Getting your club listed on the major swinging sites is a must.  The way my partner and I find clubs is through the listings on these websites and I imagine that's how most swingers go about it.  I haven't found any better way to locate clubs (and believe me, I've tried).    As I understand it, the major swinger website in Canada is Swinging Heaven.   Since you're on the border, I would also advise getting on SLS, Kasidie, SDC, and Quiver (in that order).  A decent online presence speaks volumes.  Both on your personal website but also on these websites I've listed.  Have events on these sites.  If we see an event that seems sexy and has a lot of attendees, we'll be more inclined to travel.  For us and for you, the more attendees the better.  Maybe offer small discounts for signing up on one of the swinging sites so people sign up online and boost your numbers.    Look at successful clubs like Trapeze on these websites and see what they do well.      Aside from your question - I'd be very interested in hearing the details of how things end up going with this club.  Please keep us posted!"

Swingers,3cu0lo,LouisBalfour82,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"That is a very interesting question and I'm not sure whether or not I can answer it accurately for you.  I am more than happy to try, however.    I can say with relatively certainty that the biggest thing that will attract younger swingers is other younger swingers.  This is a recursive problem, of course, but you could consider explicitly advertising this night as young.  Themes like blacklight parties, foam parties, ABC parties, or rave parties would definitely attract us.  I'd also doubly emphasize the online presence for younger swingers.  We don't want to go somewhere that is going to feel creepy or sketchy.  The quickest way to sketch us out is to have a website that looks like this or this.  This and this are amazing if you have the budget.    Obviously, I enjoy talking about this so please don't hesitate to ask any more questions."

Swingers,3cu0lo,NerdyandDirty4fun,2,Fri Jul 10 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've never once been to a club run by non-swingers that wasn't a complete disaster.  Swingers know how to cater to other swingers.  Successfully running a swingers club isn't going to be easy for you.  Having said that, your best bet for advertising will be on the local swingers sites, and building your own website.  You might want to venture out into the other local swingers clubs and see what they're doing right, and what they're doing wrong.  Finally, word of mouth will be what makes or breaks you.  Get a reputation for being full of single guys, and the couples won't come near.  Get a reputation for having a good mix of ages, with couples that are more into having sex than getting drunk, and you'll have a bright future."
Swingers,3cu53l,Fakeme2_13,4,Fri Jul 10 20:13:41 2015 UTC,"I have to say that u/Nice-Rapist may be right.   The issues at play here don't really have anything to do with swinging and no one on this sub is going to have the professional credentials to give you advice because the underlying issue at play in this situation comes down to communication.   What started out as a fantasy quickly became a nightmare. It is probably best to shelve this fantasy, I don't think either of you are going to find what you are looking for in the lifestyle. Swingers are still married couples and yes we still fight and have issues, but there needs to be a basis of open communication and trust in one another in order to resolve these issues and still have fun in the lifestyle."
Swingers,3cu53l,NerdyandDirty4fun,0,Fri Jul 10 20:49:52 2015 UTC,"Well we're still married and had discussed everything beforehand. Like I said I'm not looking into getting into the lifestyle again. I just want to hear if anyone has experience with something like this and how they were able to handle the situation. We are very open about our feelings and things, just not when it comes to this incident.  How does the issue of not talking about a swinging experience not have anything to do with a sub about swinging that touts communication as the number one golden rule? I'm not against going to a counselor but I have to be able to discuss even that with her before we can go."
Swingers,3cu53l,NerdyandDirty4fun,2,Fri Jul 10 20:55:07 2015 UTC,"We are very open about our feelings and things, just not when it comes to this incident.   I mean, that's a pretty major gap there. This was obviously an issue when it occurred, it should be one of the MOST important things to be open and honest with one another about in order to fix it.    How does the issue of not talking about a swinging experience not have anything to do with a sub about swinging that touts communication as the number one golden rule?   Because the Sub is about Swinging and what you're looking for is marital advice. Most of the people you are going to find here are successful swingers currently in the lifestyle or people who want to enter the lifestyle. We can't tell you how to get your wife to talk about a failure in the lifestyle because we don't know you and your wife and a marriage is an intricately personal relationship, even for swingers.   I'm not criticizing you for coming here and posting. I'm not telling you not to post here. I'm just saying from the sound of it you may need deeper help than can be offered from a Reddit sub that revolves around the lifestyle."
Swingers,3cu53l,NerdyandDirty4fun,0,Fri Jul 10 21:06:27 2015 UTC,yes and this is a sub about married people in an open lifestyle. other subs aren't going to be able to give me the feedback about this particular type of thing. I just don't get why I can't ask on here about bringing it up to her. I plan on finding a therapist. I just wanted some support about broaching a difficult topic with my wife that has to do with swinging.
Swingers,3cu53l,Nice-Rapist,2,Fri Jul 10 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"other subs aren't going to be able to give me the feedback about this particular type of thing.   That's the thing, neither can we. Its not that you can't post here, its that you're not going to find people here that are facing this issue because, as you have found, when you run into a brick wall like this a couple doesn't stay in the lifestyle and the people here ARE in the lifestyle.   At the end of the day, it sounds (in my opinion) like you have deeper issues in your marriage than swinging that requires a professional to walk you through them and resolve them. My wife and I have argued about stuff in the lifestyle, but she never shuts me out and she never goes off and sleeps with some random guy and she certainly has never come close to leaving me over it. You say that this was her fantasy to begin with and she went into the back and played with the woman no problem. If it were me and my wife and she was not interested, we never would have made it into the back."
Swingers,3cu53l,Nice-Rapist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:35:08 2015 UTC,Nobody is saying you can't seek advice here.  People are just saying it's not the best place to get advice.

I simply want advice on how to approach discussing it with her. I have no reason to embellish the truth of the matter. There is bad advice given by professionals too. I'm not trying to get professional expertise, just some support for something I find difficult to do."
Swingers,3cu53l,MatticusVP,5,Fri Jul 10 21:05:01 2015 UTC,Sorry - I'm not here to stay an argument with you.  Take my advice to see a pro or leave it.  I couldn't care less.  Good luck to you both.
Swingers,3cu53l,MatticusVP,0,Fri Jul 10 21:09:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice.
Swingers,3cu53l,NerdyandDirty4fun,2,Fri Jul 10 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"Nice-Rapist is totally right unfortunately.  People on this sub can give helpful advice when both of you are good communicators and willing and eager to learn. When this is the case you will get a lot of different opinions that you can aggregate and hopefully take something away from.  Sounds like you guys don't communicate at all. From the way you portray it, it sounds like your wife immediately throws up a wall to avoid talking about things that make her uncomfortable, and also retaliates against you when she feels slighted rather than talking it out. Of course this is just my impression from hearing your side of the story but, you're not gonna make headway with a person like this by being rational and supportive or whatever.   So maybe consider a real therapist or just give it more time, a lot more time, and focus more on this communication thing in the meantime, as I suspect that this dynamic has caused you guys a lot of problems in the past and I don't mean lifestyle related. People who act like this in response to stress tend to act like this fairly frequently. . ."
Swingers,3cu53l,usewhippedcream,0,Fri Jul 10 22:19:21 2015 UTC,"one   Thanks for the response.  We were and still are great communicators, just not about this one particular thing. We wouldn't have even considered doing it had we not been able to discuss everything. Some kind of switch took place that night like I've never seen before with her. We've went through stressful times before but this time was different. If it were something that occurred often I wouldn't even ask for advice. I'd know either how to fix it or that it couldn't be fixed."
Swingers,3cu53l,usewhippedcream,2,Fri Jul 10 22:30:45 2015 UTC,"I was just guessing because what you describe is a very extreme reaction.

Swingers,3csoyu,SwapFu,4,Fri Jul 10 17:22:57 2015 UTC,We were invite to a house party which we will probably go to if we get back from out of town in time. We don't know the hosts but we love parties.
Swingers,3csoyu,SwapFu,3,Fri Jul 10 13:56:22 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Who doesn't love a good party?   In the past, we have not been as big into the House Party scene, especially when it is a house party where we don't know anyone. It has always felt like people who knew each other had pre-existing chemistry that we were left out on. But it is probably more our fault than anything really."
Swingers,3csoyu,SwapFu,5,Fri Jul 10 14:06:07 2015 UTC,"We're trying this new thing where we are purposefully running toward potentially awkward situations rather than away from them.

Swingers,3csoyu,texascpl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:23:53 2015 UTC,"Hell yes! Like I said, I fully believe it is our own awkwardness that prevents us from letting loose is that environment and not the party or the host. And to be fair it has been a looooong time since we have done a house party. We are far more advanced in our ""Swap Fu"" (see what I did there!?) now-a-days.   I think we would probably be more open to trying out a house party again. Lately we have been so caught up in the club and travel scene, especially the latter. We are taking our third Swinger Trip this year when we head to Naughty in N'Awlins after doing the Vegas Exchange in 2013 and the Independence in 2014."

Swingers,3cpky2,MidwestSwingers,4,Thu Jul 9 19:35:03 2015 UTC,"Since you guys are a little younger, I'm curious what is the biggest age gap between you and the other couple that you've experienced thus far? What was that experience like for you guys?"
Swingers,3cpky2,MidwestSwingers,2,Thu Jul 9 21:28:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, the oldest we've been with so far was 28 or 27. That wasn't on purpose or anything -- just how the chips fell. However, there's an early 40s couple that we've shown interest in and they feel the same way, so we'll probably pursue that soon.  However, I would definitely be a little nervous with an older couple, mostly since they'd be more experienced and there's always that stigma that younger couples aren't ""mature"" so I feel they'd approach with caution since we're young."
Swingers,3cpky2,Nice-Rapist,-1,Fri Jul 10 01:40:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's great that you're willing to try a 40's couple. I'm sure they will be just as excited to be with a younger couple and I bet if they're interested they probably think you're mature enough for them. We'd love to hear back on your thoughts on the experience, if everything works out."

Swingers,3cpky2,NerdyandDirty4fun,-1,Fri Jul 10 07:04:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not like she had an age ""rule"", she just has a preference for people closer in age or slightly younger. At least she thought she had a preference.   I would never omit information or lie about any of our rules/boundaries. For example, we don't do separate rooms, so if a couple only did separate rooms, I wouldn't withhold that information from her, because that's a hard and fast rule with us."
Swingers,3cpky2,counselor1234,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:24:23 2015 UTC,Whats funny is that when we first started we were so young that we had a few couples turn us down because they thought we were too young.

Swingers,3cpky2,counselor1234,2,Thu Jul 9 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"I think the thought is that the younger, less experienced couples have more drama. The last time it happened to us, though, we had been in the lifestyle for 4 years. Ha."
Swingers,3cpky2,Oregon_swingers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:46:40 2015 UTC,This is interesting. Wife and I have found that our older couples come with more drama. Obviously that's confirmation bias but it's just interesting how people have different opinions.
Swingers,3co2fw,clonebloom,13,Thu Jul 9 12:12:04 2015 UTC,"We started swinging 10 yrs ago and the first party we went to, people told us that without shaving and waxing and some plastic surgery, we might have trouble finding partners.   We decided people who want all that were not worth having sex with. We did what we liked and we had fun together at parties and it wasn't long before we found many people who didn't care about hair and didn't think lipo and breast lifts were required for play.   Sure a few people just could not cope with full bush or duck dynasty beard or breasts with natural sag....somehow I do not think we missed out on anything by not getting to play with those folks.   So you two do what you like with your bodies and enjoy each other and you will find others drawn to happy playful people who don't care about hair. Let the choices you make be because you want to make them, not some weird peer pressure for sex with people you are just having fun with, not in love with."
Swingers,3co2fw,usewhippedcream,7,Thu Jul 9 14:27:49 2015 UTC,"This. We don't shave, never will.   Also my boobs sag. I fed two babies with them, okay?  Really tired of other people making comments about my body. We fuck. We love to play with other people. Don't like what you see, then go somewhere else. Too bad for you, you'll never find out how sexy we are."
Swingers,3co2fw,belle_bs,4,Thu Jul 9 20:15:36 2015 UTC,"I don't like being completely shaved but nicely trimmed is good. It helps me feel clean and I think it makes my junk look pretty good.  Completely bare is hard to maintain and can lead to other issues like ingrown hairs (which I can say from personal experience, absolutely suck)  I think a lot of people prefer it for oral, but it isn't that big of a deal. Like the comedian Rob Delaney says, most men would chew through cinder blocks to get to a pussy."
Swingers,3co2fw,vulchiegoodness,3,Thu Jul 9 13:01:22 2015 UTC,"As long as it's clean, generally its acceptable.   Me personally, I don't really care, as long as I'm not getting stabbed by stubble."
Swingers,3co2fw,notourrealnames,8,Thu Jul 9 14:49:18 2015 UTC,"Male here. I keep mine trimmed close in the summer, but a full bush on a woman makes me insane. In a good way. Secondary sex characteristics...RAWR!"
Swingers,3co2fw,MidwestSwingers,2,Thu Jul 9 13:53:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's a pretty common preference for women to prefer shaved (or at least trimmed) men. There are exceptions who like the hairy look, though.  I just trim up my chest and pubes and I'm good to go. I'm not really hairy to begin with, so it's pretty easy :)"
Swingers,3co2fw,Oregon_swingers,3,Thu Jul 9 12:20:08 2015 UTC,"Women have to at least keep it short for us.  We both hate having our noses tickled and/or getting a mouth full of hair.    Men, if you shave your balls, my wife is more likely to lick them. ;)   And yes, we practice what we preach."
Swingers,3co2fw,jollycooperation420,2,Thu Jul 9 20:03:27 2015 UTC,I keep myself (male) almost shaved. I use clippers and shave w a razor around my dick but leave it just fuzzy apart from that. I just think totally shaved looks kind of silly on guys.  For ladies I prefer shaved or that little bit of fuzz if she just shaved like a few days to a week ago. I'd rather see that which is cute than bumpy red razor burns honestly.
Swingers,3co2fw,jollycooperation420,2,Thu Jul 9 13:06:50 2015 UTC,What about your body hair in general? How common is it for men to shave their chests?
Swingers,3co2fw,NerdyandDirty4fun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:56:57 2015 UTC,I know some guys that do shave their bodies but I am lucky to have very little body hair so I don't bother with it.
Swingers,3co2fw,pencilinamango,2,Thu Jul 9 21:21:21 2015 UTC,"My wife shaves and definitely prefers for the women we play with to be shaved as well. But she doesn't feel the preference that men always have to be shaved, so that is funny.   I have recently started shaving my male pubic area but I didn't always. Its not that I feel the need to but it seems that the ladies tend to appreciate it and my balls have felt the love for sure."
Swingers,3co2fw,final_cut,2,Thu Jul 9 15:09:20 2015 UTC,"the female half here.   I believe I'd have similar preferences as your wife. Though I've never played with another woman, if I did I think I'd prefer that she mostly shave her pubic hair, akin to how I keep mine, I guess. As for guys, freshly shaved balls are pleasant, but it's more of a novelty pleasantness. Otherwise, I really don't have much preference for how men keep their pubic hair. It's when guys are shaving their chests and have stubble...that's a turnoff for me. But then again, I really like hairy chested men. IT'S JUST SO MANLY! lol"
Swingers,3co2fw,NotReallyBi,2,Thu Jul 9 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"The wife and I are both trimmed & neat, but not shaven. The wife almost sees it as a feminish thing at this point. There should be hair down there, so she has some.   Honestly, I grew up on my dads 70's & 80's Playboys, so when I see clean shaven it's a little like, ""Where's the bush?"" Of course, keeping this looking neat and tidy is alway appreciated :)"

Swingers,3co2fw,6chan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:48:15 2015 UTC,"We strongly dislike a full bush on either sex.    Women should at least keep the sides shaved bare, a little fluff up top is fine.  A mouthful of hair is just gross.    Men should keep themselves well trimmed and at least shave their balls.  If your chest hair is 3 inches long, please trim it down.  Back hair is gross.  There is nothing worse than razor burn friction so if you shave your chest, keep it smooth.      Wife would rather have hair over itchy stubble on men."
Swingers,3co2fw,6chan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:20:42 2015 UTC,We always shave before a play date. Shaving seems by far the most popular preferance in our area.  Plus for us shaving is faster and easier than trimming it up constantly.   For us we both are cool with a little bit of hair. If it's trimmed up nice it can be a real turn on. Unkempt long scraggly pubes is a turn off though.   We do find that most profiles ask for shaved genitals.
Swingers,3co2fw,venicebloggs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:45:16 2015 UTC,"Our preference is for no hair. Its more a hygiene thing, and to some extent a visual thing. Less hair means, less gunk for sweat to remain in among other body fluids, not to mention nobody likes hair in their mouth when you are going down on somebody.  Apart from that, the visual aspect of naked genitals is appealing in itself. There are those that equate shaved pubes to pre-pubescence and we honestly feel that it's them projecting their dormant sexual perversions on others, and we stay away from them.  Edit: To clarify, we don't expect others to be fully shaved, neatly trimmed, landing strip etc are all fine. Full Bush or even partial bush with full length hair is a no-no."
Swingers,3co2fw,6chan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:55:31 2015 UTC,Is there any real evidence that it's more hygienic? I've only read the opposite.  And I don't see the point in calling anyone in here a pervert.. I'd think that we're seen as perverts by a lot of folks out there.
Swingers,3co2fw,venicebloggs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"I am not calling anyone here a pervert seeing as nobody has made the argument that a person that likes shaven pubes likes children.  As far as the hygiene argument goes, I've read that Egyptians used to be obsessed with hair removal, including pubes for the same reason. And during those times lack of hair prevented transmission of at least pubic lice and diseases associated with them.   Having said that, it isn't advisable to shave a few hours before play to avoid creating fresh cuts etc. Wife and I wax and that sets us for few months at an end."
Swingers,3co2fw,6chan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:00:05 2015 UTC,Because it's a dumb argument is why it wasn't mentioned.  Does me being attracted to men without mustaches make me a pervert? Dumb argument is dumb.

How is it normal to equate hairlessness with pre-pubescence? Puberty results in way more changes in the genitals than the appearance of just  hair, and equating hairless to creepy in my mind speaks volumes of weird associations or predilections on the part of those that find it creepy"
Swingers,3co2fw,TE1381,2,Fri Jul 10 00:10:00 2015 UTC,Prepubescents don't have hair..  I don't see how it being a turn off to someone means that they are subconsciously pedophiles.
Swingers,3co2fw,Colonel26,0,Fri Jul 10 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I feel when the opposite claim is made, that those who prefer hairlessness subconsciously are. One common characteristic is too absurd a reason to make that association not to mention it violates ceteris paribus"

Swingers,3cmreu,DoubleEntendre_,2,Thu Jul 9 14:05:55 2015 UTC,I once met a couple in which the female half was a mail ordered bride. They were nice.
Swingers,3cmreu,MatticusVP,5,Thu Jul 9 21:00:22 2015 UTC,I think they are often women who married money who don't have options in life and are using the lifestyle to get the sex their old/fat can't provide.  What I don't understand is what couples these guys get?  Not that I'd even ask but my wife would be like HELL no.  Regardless of how hot the girl is.
Swingers,3cmreu,texascpl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:26:33 2015 UTC,I've seen some where the guy just watches.
Swingers,3cmreu,YoureNotWearingASlip,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:52:42 2015 UTC,I have spent more time wondering how the hell this shakes out for them than I care to admit.  If you dont like banging your husband what makes you think somebody else will?
Swingers,3cmreu,jollycooperation420,2,Fri Jul 10 04:22:39 2015 UTC,"I have seen this very often at our local swinger's club. The guy is paying for it SOMEHOW, either by the hour or by the alimony (someday).  It also really makes me sad in those circumstances, because you can see the woman is catering to this dude's boring heteronormative porno fantasies to please him, and she's not getting much of out of the deal."
Swingers,3cmreu,ArghJustArgh,3,Thu Jul 9 20:57:08 2015 UTC,I know one couple that's done it.  They're both assholes.
Swingers,3cmreu,Nice-Rapist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:23:22 2015 UTC,"Prostitutes: I suspect that the couples that want to meet and fuck with not much personal chemistry, are the same ones that have hired sex workers in whatever capacity. I guess if that's the kind of dynamic you want a prostitute is probably the easiest route.  The other situation is single guys hiring escorts to take to parties because single guys are either excluded or they think it will increase their chances. We've seen one or two we've suspected of this and just gave them a wide berth even though the female half was pretty hot."
Swingers,3cmreu,jollycooperation420,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:25:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is common as in the norm, but there does seem to be a lot of discussion about it on this sub.

It isn't really swinging and frankly doesn't seem like it would be that much fun. If you have more money than time and don't mind the risk of running afoul of the law, and don't mind reducing sex to a business transaction go for it.  There is a sub dedicated to how to do this, but for the life of me I can't remember what it is."

Partner and I were all over the hooker as she was very cute, but we left the guy on the fringes.  Not very nice, but the hooker was into it, and he didn't really bother to find out if my partner would be into him. It was awesome getting a double bj knowing some other guy paid for half of it."
Swingers,3cmreu,cuckyfag,0,Thu Jul 9 12:40:06 2015 UTC,"My wife and I have hired a masseuse/escort.  It's kind of ridiculous that they charge so much more if two people are in the room, even if they are only interacting with one.  It seems silly to charge more in a situation where you'll be safer.  I've also had escorts simply refuse to work with couples.  Fun fact -- in Austria, where prostitution is legal, women aren't allowed into the brothel.  :(  Wife and I tried to go to a fully legal brothel, and she was turned away at the door, so we both left."
Swingers,3cmreu,Tymanthius,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:49:21 2015 UTC,It seems silly to charge more in a situation where you'll be safer.   The escort wouldn't be safer in that situation. S/he's outnumbered 2 to 1.  So makes sense to me.
Swingers,3cl63n,LordLingham,3,Wed Jul 8 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"First experienced sucked. Bad communication. We were new and the experienced couple didn't communicate with each other or us and lots of confusion ensued, leading to lots of trepidation and boredom.   Second experience was one of the hottest moments of our lives.  Lesson learned - don't judge the Lifestyle on any one experience.  There will be ups and downs. Some experiences will be hot, some will elicit little more than a shoulder shrug.   Most times, for me, swinging is like going to the movies - in general, you'll have a fun time and be entertained.  Sometimes you're bored and feel like you wasted your time... and once in a while, you leaving talking about how great it was and it sticks in your mind for a few days and is a fun topic of conversation to bring up. Hell, you may even decide you want to see a sequel!  Have fun, don't put pressure on yourselves and enjoy each experience on its own.   Good luck."

Swingers,3cl63n,STL-MO-CPL,2,Thu Jul 9 01:10:23 2015 UTC,"We dove in head first on our first experience.   We were young, but we had talked about swinging early. It makes it a lot easier when your girlfriend tells you that she is very bi-sexual and that anytime you want a threesome she is ready to go. As a single soldier in the Army, when life was a lot lonelier, I had come across the Swingers lifestyle. It seemed like a good way to get out and blow off some sexual frustration. I never did the single male routine because it seemed like a dynamic that was not for me. But with my girlfriend bringing up threesome's within the first few months of dating, I countered with swinging since I was familiar with it. After watching a swinger documentary by chance on VH1 my girlfriend looked at me and said ""I can do that."" I agreed and so we started looking around on sites.   We went to a club a few times with a couple that we had met online but never formally hooked up with (The other girl was way more into being with other guys than girls and always tried to get me on my own). We had been striking out for a few weeks. Finally one night we met a girl that was there in a polygamous group. She was there with her husband and her boyfriend. We talked and we got along and before long ended up in a semi-private room, me with the other girl and my wife in a MFM threesome. It was intense. When we were finished we left the room to find that a huge crowd had gathered right outside to watch!   After we were done we talked and gave our thoughts on the encounter. 9 years later we are still in lifestyle and loving it."

It was a positive one, I'm happy to inform :)  We are vacationing in the North America (as the name suggests, we're Northern Europeans), and went to club in Toronto. A very laid-back, casual place, only couples and single females allowed. People were super nice, not at all pushy.  We went to the play area, there was this couple I had been talking briefly to outside in the smoking area. The girl was really hot :) She wanted to massage me (the female), which was very nice. Ended up giving a hand to her partner in fingerin her (pun intended). It was the first time I'd ever played with a girl. Then my partner and I had sex, and they had sex next to us. Later that night we joined a group of three women and a guy, and my partner went down on one of the girls while I went down on him.  So, I guess it was a very soft start :) But it was all nice and hot, and when we got back to our hotel, we continued the party just the two of us ;)"

Swingers,3cl63n,MidwestSwingers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:32:35 2015 UTC,"Our first time was after a very drunk girl noticed us a party and kept talking to us that night. We were sober, just met her, and were totally unaware how serious she was. We exchanged numbers though.   Fast forward a few weeks and I invited her to another party and accidentally gave her too many drinks after she bragged about how good she can handle her liquor. Barely knowing her, I held her hair while she vomited, put her in a spare bed for the night, and checked in on her frequently.   By this point, I had forgotten about her initial comments. We started talking daily, the three of us, and became good friends, and something she said triggered my curiosity. I asked if she wanted to have some fun with my wife and me. She did. The problem was a friend was staying for a few weeks. So, we had our first threesome while a friend was asleep, completely unaware.   We played with her a bit, and she helped us get confidence to try more. Great friend to this day."
Swingers,3cl63n,countingletters,0,Thu Jul 9 10:18:16 2015 UTC,"Our first experience was.... not that good :D We went to a new years party organised by one of the few swing clubs our country has to offer.  The club itself was terrible, and they allowed single males (even though they stated that no single males are allowed under no circumstances), so we had a ton of pushy males. we met a really cool couple who was in our age-range (we were both 18 at the time), and after a few rounds of drinks and dancing we started having fun at the nearby couch, but seeing as we were being swarmed by legions of single males, we couldn't do much, so in the end, the girls played with each-other while me and the other male fended off the ever-increasing legion of single males trying to join in. After that, we left the club and went to their place, where we continued drinking and having fun, unfortunately the real ""fun"" didn't continue, since we were all stressed out by all the jerking around us (it was their first time too).  But nevertheless, the problems we had our first time didn't at all push back our wish to continue down the lifestyle, we loved the little bit of fun we got out of our first experience :D Unfortunately, we still didn't get a chance to full-swap, we only have a few FFM's down our sleeves :D"

Swingers,3cm9id,introvertmale,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:15:37 2015 UTC,We had an official topic a while back about bringing up swinging to your SO.  You should give that a look.

You may want to check /r/hotwife for more detailed advice.  That said, the swinger and hotwife communities have a good bit of overlap.  We've never looked for single males, but generally it's not recommended to hook up with friends.  You could consider making a profile on swinglifestyle.com and stating exactly what you're looking for.  No matter where you go looking, however, you'll probably have a good number of guys interested.  Screening them will be the issue.  Anybody got good advice about screening for single males?"
Swingers,3cm9id,DoubleEntendre_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"Im sure its ok to pick up guys in bars, or bring friends from real life. The only issue with that is complicating existing relationships by adding parties who may not be ""lifestyle friendly"". A guy in a bar might think its a legit relationship pursuit or he might decide to run his mouth when he sees you again, etc. He may tell someone who knows you and or your husband and ""out"" you to friends or family. Its not a given, but its more likely than with a ""lifestyle"" friendly guy.   A guy from a website may have references, and would probably be easier to communicate with before hand to make your experience better. Again, this is a generalization and not always the case, but most single guys in the LS know their role pretty well and are ok with it, as well as have a bit more discretion."

Swingers,3cm9id,LordLingham,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"This is a sweeping generalization, but typically swinging implies that both partners are involved in some capacity in the play.  What I get from your post is more of a /r/hotwife or /r/cuckold vibe.  Maybe I'm misreading your version of your boyfriend's fantasy, but you may want to investigate various other flavors of /r/nonmonogamy and decide what works best for you."
Swingers,3cm9id,STL-MO-CPL,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:15:38 2015 UTC,"We looked into cuckold, but there's a certain psychological/race thing that goes a long side it that we cant get into.

Sometimes I want to have an MFM with my wife because I love watching her, and participating as much or as little as I want.  Sometimes I want to play with a couple so I can have fun too.  Sometimes we have a single lady (or two) join us and it's more of a chillout session with sex.  Which of these things is technically swinging? I dunno who gives a shit. It's all just different flavors of fun. It's good that you are talking about your fantasies . . . just focus on what interests you and what you want to try together and not so much on what to call it."
Swingers,3cm9id,STL-MO-CPL,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of how much we sometimes get bogged down with labels.  I think we put too much importance on classifying people.  However, it is convenient to use common terms to help impart a certain degree of understanding with a quick phrase instead of having to launch into a big long explanation.  With that being said, hotwife is a somewhat universal term used for when the guy enjoys seeing his wife play with other men.  Cuckolding is the same, but with a certain degree of humiliation thrown in for added effect.  The racial aspect you've picked up on is not necessary, but it does tend to be a pretty popular genre within the cuckold world.  There are a million sites out there that will be happy to expand on these themes further, but you may wish to check out http://www.ourhotwives.org/forum/ for fun."
Swingers,3cmsgi,introvertmale,6,Thu Jul 9 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"Congrats on looking into the lifestyle, we hope you'll enjoy it!  Before you get too involved, you should make sure your relationship is rock solid.  The advice I generally give is that you are not ready for nonmonogamous sex if:    You experience visceral feelings of hurt, jealousy, or insecurity thinking about your partner playing with someone else. You can’t discuss your wants, needs, and sexual desires openly and honestly. You are having problems in your primary relationship with trust, communication, or compatibility. You want to use swinging to “fix” your relationship. You aren’t really interested in your partner so you are using the excuse of swinging to get a chance to fuck another person (if this is the case, you probably need to reconsider your relationship altogether).      If you believe none of the above apply to you and your SO, then you're probably in a healthy jumping off place to look into swinging (yay!).  You'll want to communicate a lot and decide on exactly what you are and are not looking for and set up some ground rules.  Remember that there's no 'right' way to swing and you should only do what you're comfortable with.    The two main ways to find other people to swing with are with websites and at swinger clubs.  You could also use dating apps like tinder or find people at bars, but those methods aren't as popular here.  As far as websites go, swinglifestyle.com (SLS) is the largest and most popular and is free so it's a good starting point.  Club-wise, we went to southwest virginia socials a few times before we moved to Florida.  They recently started meeting in Ghent West Virginia.  Dunno how far that is from you, but they were a cool group.    Hope that helps.  Let us know if you have any questions."

Swingers,3cn84m,Colonel26,7,Thu Jul 9 05:33:00 2015 UTC,"Just a thought here. Your post tells us all how attractive and fit and young looking you both are, and your search for ""quality"". It comes across to me as a bit pompous and that's rather off putting to those of us who might be great fun, talented, willing, and perhaps a bit outside your self-declared threshold of perfect.  Don't mean this offensive, but you asked.  Sincerely, a fat old lame bald couple ;)."
Swingers,3cn84m,NaughtySpot,3,Thu Jul 9 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"Well no I'm not offended but...... um.......your statement is rather silly.  The question isn't meant to be pompous.  The reason we are doing this is for sexual excitement......which generally means finding someone who you are sexually attracted to, and someone who fits your criteria.  Do you realize how much of a red herring your assertion is?  It's your body, you shouldn't be expected to sleep with someone you're not attracted to.   Wouldn't you agree?  And never once in any of my posts did I state that we were looking for 'perfect'.  We are simply looking for people in our age range (20's to mid 30's) who are fit and attractive, not perfect.   If there is no attraction, then what is the point?    Also, yes we are looking for quality, as in they have decent personalities, are fun to hang out with, and aren't douchebags.   Being attractive and having a good personality aren't mutually exclusive."
Swingers,3cn84m,NaughtySpot,7,Thu Jul 9 14:56:18 2015 UTC,I'm just saying how your description comes across. It comes across as pompous. I'm sure you don't mean it that way.   We like to think of ourselves as attractive and with good personalities. That being said about half of our play partners have been on the heavier side. In the end we have found personality to be a far better indicator of a good time then age or weight.
Swingers,3cn84m,NaughtySpot,2,Thu Jul 9 15:01:44 2015 UTC,"Well I certainly respect that, but you are also probably looking to get different things out of swinging than we are.........i.e. personality and the social aspect may be more important for you.   We are mostly just in to each other, and we get off on seeing each other being pleasured by attractive people.  When we had the MFM 3somes, I enjoyed it as much as she did because I got to see her getting pounded from behind by a hung 25 year old with ripped abs and that had the 'Holister' look, meanwhile she was making out with me and sucking my dick.  After both times, he hung out for about another 5 minutes, we exchanged pleasantries, and he left.  After that she and I excitedly talked about the experience, looked at some of the pics we had taken of her taking on two cocks, and then had some super hot Round 2 sex.  The idea is that we had an exciting no strings attached experience with an attractive person, and that's the allure.   We just want to find reliable couples to play with in the same fashion."

Swinging in general just seems to be a more common past-time for mature adults.   A lot of younger couples I meet aren't yet there in their relationships to explore outside of each other.   Where do you typically look to match up with other couples? Online?
Swingers,3cn84m,tpagator,2,Thu Jul 9 21:59:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hear you. We've tried Craigslist, dabbled in SLS, and have talked to a few couples on Tinder.

I've also heard good things about Caliente, but haven't been yet.  I think your best bet is to try the clubs when a big event is going on.  Just go with the intent of having a good time, whether or not you hook up with others.  You'll have the best chance of meeting younger, attractive (local) couples if you go during big events.  For everyone else: house party's and hotel take-overs really aren't a big thing down here, because we are close to some of the best clubs in the U.S. (basically resort hotels that are closed to the public, that host parties all the time)."

While my SO and I are just getting into the lifestyle, I worked at swingers clubs and nudist resorts and can tell you from experience that if you go only by looks then you will be disappointed and should hire an escort that is a perfect 10.   Swingers are looking for fun couples that they connect with and can have a good time. Sometimes you go wild for a thick gal because of the stunning tits or great BJ skills. A chubby, bald guy will probably rock your girl's pussy into next week.   Everyone has likes and dislikes, which is fine, but if you are so close-minded that you're not willing to give people a chance then you are going to be posting a lot more of these bitchy posts."

Some people like chubby girls, some people like black girls, some people are into fat, bald dudes, etc....  We are into young attractive people because that's what we are.  There is nothing close-minded or discriminatory about that.   And no, a chubby, bald guy will not 'rock my girl's pussy' because she would be terribly turned off by that and rightfully so. This isn't a job application or a housing loan where you should be 'non-discriminatory'.  This is your body, your temple, and you are letting people have access to you on an intimate level.  That means you should be extremely discriminatory and only play with someone if they have the qualifications that turn you on and you deem appropriate.  My God, we don't need politically correct affirmative action swinging lol I don't think anyone could make any reasonable or legitimate argument against that."
Swingers,3cn84m,flwrsme,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:16:00 2015 UTC,Of course you have the final say and the choice is yours. But you have heard how many legitimate arguments already on this post? You really came on here to hear what you wanted to hear and it didn't work out that way. Good luck to you and your smoking hot girl just don't be afraid to try something new and show some personality.
Swingers,3cn84m,hotwifefun,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:21:58 2015 UTC,"Actually I did hear what I wanted to hear........I made contact with another couple that posted on here that are young and attractive, and only live about hour away from us.  Another post told us about the first weekend of every month when there are a ton of young couples at Caliente, which is a nudist/swingers resort that is close by us.  I appreciate everyone's opinions, and I very much understand the importance of having a good personality.   What we want are people with good personalities AND good looks.  I know that it may take some work to find that, but I really don't think that it's too much to ask.   And no, regardless of peoples opinions, it would be silly for us to accept the concept that we just 'get over ourselves and play with fat/bald/unattractive/old people' just because they have great personalities.  Don't get me wrong, we would still be FRIENDS with those people and socialize with them, we just aren't going to fuck them.   And that's totally fair."
Swingers,3cn84m,hotwifefun,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:33:43 2015 UTC,"I love the way people take things you didn't say and run off with them.  You basically said that you're young and attractive, backed that theory up with pictures, and said you'd like to find someone young and attractive because that's what you're attracted to.  How dare you!!!   I wish you the best of luck finding who you are looking for.  They're out there and they live in Tampa.  The only thing I would recommend is to not hold firm to any particular age limit.  Personality counts for a ton, so be open to fudging that number line a little."

If we found a couple that was 40 and they were both super hot and great personalities, we would play with them in a heartbeat.  We aren't that rigid, we are just trying to find others like us :).  I do appreciate everyone's input though, even if they took a little of what I was saying out of context.  I certainly don't mean to offend!"

We're also in Florida, but most of the lifestyle stuff we attend is in the Orlando area and I will agree with others who mentioned SDC, since it is a very active in FL and great for finding out about Meet & Greets and parties in the area.  There is one that goes down every second Friday night at Stigma in downtown Orlando, lots of hot couples and you have to RSVP to the party on SDC to attend.  Caliente is good when AAHZ does events there.  In Kissimmee just outside Orlando, there is Secrets Resort/Club.  They do clothing optional pool parties on the weekends and have parties at the club at nights, plus they have on premise playrooms and hotel rooms.  Check out http://www.secretsfl.com and http://www.hedoevents.com  Last but not least if you have the vacation time and money for a lifestyle vacation you should try Young Swingers Week at Hedonism II in Jamaica.  The name says it all but there's info, pics, videos, schedules, and more at http://www.youngswingersweek.com.  We're hosts for it, going this October 2 - 11 and also in March 18 - 26 2016.  Feel free to PM if you want more info.  You can't beat an all inclusive 7 day vacation at a resort with a hundred or more other sexy naked couples that are in the lifestyle!"

Here are some pics of us for reference if it helps:  http://colonel26.imgur.com/all/  Anyways, everyone that has responded to us thus far is either 1) in their late 50's or older  2) missing teeth/ from the trailer park/ ghetto  or  3) fat/bald/out of shape.

You could be my wife and I and could have toddlers and have no time to.yourselves or anyone else lol  My wife and I are reasonably attractive,  we think and we have to weed through the unmentionables.  It's just part of it.  Just seems as though if you're that attractove, you'd have more people approach you.  They dont, because you're intimidating.  Again, I didn't see your pics because they were not there.  I'm just going by what you're telling me.  Proof is sort of in your post here.  You tell us you're picky.   You let us all know youre smoking hot.  You have a very select few that you're talking about.   There's not a ton of people in this world that are perfect, what you're looking for....  To be honest, I applaud the trailer parks, 50 somethings, out of shape people for even making an attempt.  My wife and I probably wouldn't even attempt for your list of desirables only fit a certain number of people.  You guys basically want perfect body, model type, gorgeous people.  It's going to be hard to find.   Until then, get used to many people at least taking a shot."

He needs to be your voice, when you may be pre occupied.    In these situations, just remember, YOU have all the power in the world.  Its completely up to you to make your voice heard.  Don't do anything you don't want to (example large penis), because I promise there will be someone else there to satisfy your desires.   Have fun, I would be interested in the follow up."

Not every woman's uterus is at the same angle, and they have been frequently known to change positions (typically after childbirth) in either direction. Vaginal depth is a more likely matter to be concerned with given that a really long dick can bump the cervix painfully in some positions... oddly, there are some women who really enjoy that, but most do not."

Swingers,3ckpqc,texascpl,4,Wed Jul 8 17:46:31 2015 UTC,"Having been on many CC cruises here is the deal to the best of my knowledge.   CC had a split in ownership.  Bob and Wayne parted ways.  Bob was the organizer Wayne had the money.  To reserve an entire cruise ship for a charter cruise takes a LOT of money, I've heard various amounts but somewhere between 1-2.5 million (maybe more).  If your cruise doesn't sell, the line still gets that money, they won't lose money for a specialty cruise like a swingers one.   Bob didn't have the cash right away to reserve it (plus there was a rumor that Royal Caribbean decided to not do them any more, this is believable being RC really stepped up their family oriented advertizing lately).    The whole ""swingers cruise"" thing was in jeopardy.  Suddenly ""Bliss Cruise"" shows up on the CC site, and we assumed it was the CC cruise under a new name.    Later we find out that Bliss is through SLS, and I was told but I have no confirmation that Wayne is the backer of this one.  I could be very wrong on that.  Anyways Bliss is completely different from CC.  SLS/Bliss decided that Bob was now a competitor (even though they were selling the Bliss cruise) and removed ALL of his parties from their site, including Naughty in Nawlins.    CC since then raised the funds and is now doing Cruises as well.  I have no idea what their plans are now, but I do wonder if they will ever try a Nov cruise and compete directly with Bliss.   If that happens odds are we all lose but thats another topic.   The Bliss cruise has me slightly worried (we are booked) just because Bob has a LOT of experience with this kinda things.  From what I gather the first swingers cruise was a Yolo one and things got a bit nutty.  Bob and his people knew how to do security, etc and were very nice as well.    So the Bliss cruise might be awesome, might be a disaster, might be somewhere in between but its just an unknown at this point."
Swingers,3ckpqc,Swingersbaby,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:08:57 2015 UTC,"Excellent info, thanks!  I'm not too worried about the setup because I'm sure the people running Bliss have been on many of the Couples Cruises and know the deal as to how the entertainment, security, and playrooms should be room.

Until I got on the ship I didn't really know what to expect, and that was despite asking.    I think there's a lot more responses/posts on ATF regarding the upcoming Bliss cruise than about the upcoming CC, although the Bliss cruise is much closer in time now, so you might expect that.  Comparing total posts is disingenuous since CC has been around a long time, and most of the posts are ""I booked, see you on the boat!""  ok thanks random person, thats helpful info."

We had a blast. There was a huge variety of people there and we had a tone of fun. We started out a little timid, but in the end we ended up with a different couple each night, sometimes two, and tucked 1 orgy under our belts.   From what we understand, the only difference between the Bliss and the Independence would be the hosts. Bliss would be the first takeover hosted directly by SLS I guess in an attempt to expand their operations? One would think more cruises the better, but my only concern is how the two cruises might suffer by splitting who goes on which cruise as they are both in November."
Swingers,3cj2kc,FirstTimer696,4,Wed Jul 8 08:24:24 2015 UTC,"Respect the husband, don't ignore him or act like he isn't there.    Also be super clean, maybe give your bits a trim."
Swingers,3cj2kc,the_tytan,5,Wed Jul 8 16:45:43 2015 UTC,"SMs came up on my local board and I posted this there first. A lot of this advice is universal to anyone in the LS, but we have had a streak of new SMs lately that just do not get it. Obviously every couple is different and some people are more forgiving on this stuff, or have different kinks that might make some of this invalid but I think it is pretty sound:  Open advice to SMs:  1) Don't be married. Or if you are in an open relationship be prepared to have us confirm with your SO that you have a hall pass.  2) Be prepared to engage both of us. The LS is not about you being able to just bang other guys wives and girlfriends. You need to offer something to both members of the couple. What do you bring to the table that appeals to both of us?  3) You are not the stud you think you are. I don't care how good looking you are, how much time you spend at the gym, or how big your dick is. SMs are a dime a dozen, what makes you different? Why should I let you fuck my girl?  4) Be respectful of our relationship. Respect our privacy. Listen to and follow our rules.  5) Don't be a flake. If you say you are coming, be there. On time. There are no second chances.  6) If you aren't prepared to be in bed with both of us GTFO. If you can't get hard with another guy in the room or freak out because of incidental contact with another male you do not belong in the LS. For fuck's sake don't say you are bi if you aren't.  7) Be prepared to perform. Don't be drunk, don't be sloppy, don't be weird. Be showered and smelling good, dress nice, easy on the aftershave though.  8) Read our fucking profile. Don't send canned messages, don't lead with dick pics, face pics are necessary, this isn't fucking Ashley Madison."
Swingers,3cj2kc,sloppy_jones,3,Wed Jul 8 19:19:30 2015 UTC,"There are a couple pieces of advice I can give:   Do not ignore the husband. He is the gatekeeper. Her life is her husband and she will not respect anyone who does not respect him. Also, if he does not like you then he will not let the threesome happen. It is important you get along with him. Put aside any thoughts that she will be or is attracted to you. A couple that has a threeosme has a threesome for other reasons than sexual problems in the bedroom. Accept you are a ""tool"" for the couple to use. Remember as harsh as this may sound, single males are expendable and easily replacable.  Respect their relationship Since there is a big age gap, finding something in common maybe difficult and it can be an issue. Find out about there generation and try to find a way to relate.  Practice safe-sex Be clear on boundaries and preferences. Never assume and always asik. Show up a few minutes early and if you are going to cancel, give plenty of notice. Do not be homophobic! Two male threesome is rarely about male-on-male contact. Most of the time it is completely straight with the focus on pleasing her. It is important to remember you will need to be naked with another male and need to be comfortable with him there too. If you cannot then you have no business participating in a threesome."

Interact with BOTH of them. They are a couple, and I've heard from couples a lot that a huge complaint is when one person, usually the husband, is completely ignored, unless that's their thing as it might be in some hotwife/cuckold situations.  I still get a little nervous from time to time when meeting new couples, but then I realize they're in the same boat and they're people just like I am with vanilla lives, jobs, a family etc. It just so happens we're meeting to possibly have sex later."
Swingers,3cj2kc,mnbidude,7,Wed Jul 8 10:10:59 2015 UTC,"How you will act really depends on where you are meeting and what the expectations are for that meet.  Example:  bar meet with a couple who says they don't play on the first date.  Then be cool, confident but not cocky and do NOT expect that you will be the one to make them break their rule.  You're selling yourself.  Example:  meeting at their house with full knowledge you're gonna fuck.  Be on time.  Be clean.  Wear nice but easy-to-shed clothes.  Follow their lead.  Don't forget there are 2 other people there.  Suck his cock if he's into that.  Well - that last bit is my thing, lol."

She is going to want you freshly showered and ready to fuck. It don't hurt if you apply baby powder to your shoulders arms only. Careful not to get any on your cock. You are new for them so you don't know their  preferences are. My wife likes to grab her lovers by the cock once he gets naked and walk him into the shower.

Swingers,3cjh49,jitoman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"It was a bit difficult at first, I like to watch, she would rather be watched. So we had to balance both our expectations.   Though I don't think any amount of watching would lead to swapping.   We find that making new friends in the lifestyle did help us overcome some of the early hurdles. Things like ""these are just normal people who like sex and are willing to try new things"". That was a big eye opener for my wife.   You'll see alot of places where they say, communication is key, hands down this is the most important thing.  You have to be able to ask and answer some rather detailed questions about your desire. This can get overwhelming since we are told that your porn habits and sexual desire should be private and shameful.  We found out that we like pretty similar porn. (The first time we watched porn together was at a swing club, now we mostly watch porn together )  Communication again, is important."

Go to a club, see what there is to see, and take it all in.  Maybe it's not for you.  Maybe it's the sexiest thing you ever did.  Going to a club with no expectations will allow you to fairly assess the situation and see if you want to progress farther next time."

However, I've continually heard that C4P (http://www.clubforeplay.com) is pretty strong in the central Midwest in general.  I've said this repeatedly, so bear with my repetition.  I sure wish there would be some consolidation in the market so the consumer would have an easier time finding a solution that works for them.  There are so many sites out there, the user bases are diluted and you have to go on a treasure hunt just to find a good fit for your area.  Heaven forbid you actually travel much and want a single site to work well for your home and for your frequent travel destinations.  You might have an easier time taking selfies with the Loch Ness Monster."

Put 25648 in the promo code and get a free month to try it out.  We use it to set up speed dating in new cities.  Has a good database all over.  Must say we haven't tried the club in Tulsa donkey90745 was talking about.  Curious about the clientele there

When we moved to Iowa from California, we noticed that SLS, which we had used with great success in Cali for years, was a dead-end. Hardly any locals to be found, and those that did exist weren't very responsive because they never logged into the site. We tried several other sites with similar results... then we were finally directed towards SV by a kind soul, and found that it's the place to be."

Swingers,3cg6b1,ERVip,3,Tue Jul 7 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you to everyone who messaged me.  I actually wasn't expecting that kind of response which is quite encouraging and exciting!  I originally requested a PM because I didn't want to write on here and inundate everyone with a million questions but it seems like people are fine with that.  So, I guess I'll start with just a few questions and keep going from there...    Is jealousy or insecurities ever an issue?  Do most couples have rules that they set for themselves and if so what kind of rules?  I find it so interesting how couples who do this are usually in long-term serious relationships, and I'm curious to know how swinging either hurts of hinders that relationship (although it sounds like it mostly enhances the intimacy that's already here)  Where do you even begin?  How often do most people engage in doing this?  Every few months? Once a month? Weekly?   I hope that's not too much to start with and answer any or all questions.  Thank you all again so much!!"
Swingers,3cg6b1,DoubleEntendre_,3,Tue Jul 7 19:39:42 2015 UTC,"Is jealousy or insecurity ever an issue?   It can be.  It depends on the couple.  Some people get visceral feelings of hurt or jealousy when they think about their partner with another person.  That's okay - that's simply how some people are and swinging probably isn't for you if so.  We weren't sure so we took it slow and made it a rule that either partner could stop the interaction at any time.  Turns out I don't get jealous and enjoy it when my girlfriend has a good time.  She's even luckier - she gets off on seeing me with another woman.  We did have a bit of an issue when she started experiencing new relationship energy and I wasn't prepared for it.  It made me feel insecure.  A little later I experienced it for myself and understood.  It's actually really cool that we can let each other get that new relationship high.  That's closed off to most people in committed relationships.  It would have gone a lot smoother if I'd been prepared for that, however.   Do most couples have rules that they set for themselves and if so what kind of rules?   Yeah, most couples have a few rules.  Check out this official thread we had about it.   I find it so interesting how couples who do this are usually in long-term serious relationships, and I'm curious to know how swinging either hurts of hinders that relationship (although it sounds like it mostly enhances the intimacy that's already here)   Really cool topic and it's actually an area of active research.  We occasionally get psychologists or therapists polling the subreddit on this topic.  Again, it depends on the strength of the relationship.  Lots of people like to say that swinging enhances a relationship.  It's something special that you both share and give to your partner.  It tends to help couples communicate better.  It can also bring out the bad in some relationships.  Jealousy, insecurity, sexual bargaining, and the like can be made much worse by opening up your relationship to swinging.  This is why it's important for a couple to be very comfortable/stable if they're looking into swinging.   Where do you even begin?   To what?  Bring it up to your partner?  Find other people to play with?   How often do most people engage in doing this? Every few months? Once a month? Weekly?   I actually took some data on this subreddit about this!  The short version is as often as they want.  Each couple wants different things out of swinging and there's no 'right' way to swing.  Some people are doin' it multiple times a week.  Some only once a year.  The majority are between 4 times a month and once every 4 months.  Check out these stats!"
Swingers,3cg6b1,DoubleEntendre_,3,Tue Jul 7 19:55:47 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh, already so amazingly helpful.  I was going through some of the rule thread you put in there, and what does ""taking one for the team"" mean?  That seems to be a common rule.  I guess I should have been less vague with my ""where do you even begin"" question.  What I meant was, how do most get started?  I mean, I can't imagine you just go right in to full on penetrative sex with other people, but I could be wrong."
Swingers,3cg6b1,exiestjw,2,Tue Jul 7 20:28:00 2015 UTC,"What does ""taking one for the team"" mean?   That means to play with somebody you're not attracted to to allow your partner to play with somebody they are attracted to.   What I meant was, how do most get started? I mean, I can't imagine you just go right in to full on penetrative sex with other people, but I could be wrong.   Depends.  Some couples are completely okay with jumping into full-on penetrative sex with other couples (known as full swap).  You can definitely ease into it.  Examples would be:   Swap partners and make out. Swap partners but limit it to oral sex (soft swap) Have sex with your own partner in the same room as another couple doing the same.   Obviously, it's important to let other potential partners know what you are and are not okay with at the time being.  That might not be what they're looking for at the time.  Most people I've met are okay with helping another couple get their comfort level up, though."
Swingers,3cg6b1,pencilinamango,2,Tue Jul 7 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine you just go right in to full on penetrative sex with other people, but I could be wrong.   Its certainly can be very different for everyone, but my guess is it usually goes like:   Going to a swingers club and flirting with other people and then getting turned on and going off to a room just the two of you and have sex same room sex - having sex in the same room as another couple soft swap - partners switch for kissing/oral/masturbation, but you go back to your partner for penetrative sex   from here it goes all kinds of places   same room full swap separate room swap playing with others without your partner   Its likely that swinglifestyle.com is the most popular place to meet others outside of the clubs in your area."
Swingers,3cg6b1,ScarletGirlfriend,3,Tue Jul 7 22:14:55 2015 UTC,"So many great answers here...but I like staying active in this sub, so I'll throw a few your way too!  1 - Jealousy issues - Of course, these can come up. I've found that the best way to deal is to always return and support your partner. And communicate in either very specific, or very general terms. For example, ""I really liked the way that girl grabbed my ass."" or ""That sure was a fun and crazy night!"" As opposed to ""there was just something about that person."" I can grab your ass, or have a crazy night, but a ""just something"" is a little weird (for me, maybe not for others). I like to not think my ego is TOO fragile, but communicating effectively is key. And if your both having fun, that stuff is easier to deal with.   2 - Rules - absoultely. This is how trust is built. The wife and I are in the soft swap catagory, and we like it that way, for now. Knowing what to expect, even if you are going into an unexpected situtation (like a club) helps to do your own prep work for after as far as those jealousy and insecurities go.   3 - Couples - Long Term - The wife and I celebrate 10 years of awesome marriage this year. I personally feel that it takes that amount of time to have a few bymps that you make it through so have a deep, deep trust for one another. That also helps tremendously with the jealousy thing too. We know who we're going home with, and who our primary is. The other people are for fun, and everyone is cool with that. I think if you start too soon, and don't have that trust, than it can be a helluva lot of fun, but it just may not be as a deep connection. It's a great way to add a littel spice to things!  4 - Beginning - Conversations are great! And the book Sex at Dawn is a must read & discuss!!  5 - For the wife and I, we started just exploring last summer, with our first real ""experience"" being this summer. So it would be every several months. That's honestly more about scheduling than anything else. With a business to run, kids, and an extended family that travels in often...it's just abuout finding the free time. Summers tend to be a little better for that :)  Just my 2 cents! Happy to keep answering too! Good luck with you and yours!"

Swingers,3cg6b1,DoubleEntendre_,3,Tue Jul 7 20:16:28 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you. My questions are:  1) does swinging work for couples who have experienced infidelity? In my situation, my boyfriend carried on some online relationships into the first few months of our explicitly monogamous relationship. We have got past that but I wonder if this might bring back feelings.   2) does anyone have experience of their partner talking to others online (with consent)? My boyfriend and I both get off on the idea of the other being wanted by another person and we wanted to test the water with some online activity first, before physical.  3) does swinging definitely not work if there is a jealous partner? I am a jealous person but weirdly, the feeling really gets me off. I was just wonder if anyone has ever mastered the jealousy and used it to their advantage or is it always negative in this situation.   4) the stereotypical swinger is older, in my mind. I am in my early twenties (okay.. very early twenties..) and my partner is 27. Are we more likely to find older couples or..?  I had loads of other questions but they've conveniently all gone out of my mind so I'll just post them as and when I remember them. And thanks for any advice in advance :)"
Swingers,3cg6b1,DoubleEntendre_,2,Tue Jul 7 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"theres no easy way to answer this question. Its likely there exist many successful swinging couples that have experienced infidelity, but its obviously not something that usually enhances a relationship. I'm sure there are lots of couples that flirt online with others consensually. only you can answer this. Again, I'm sure there are successful swinging couples where there is lots of jealousy, but obviously its not something that usually enhances a relationship.  its true that the swinging crowd in general is older than your average scene. But if you're in or near a big city you're not going to have trouble finding people your age."
Swingers,3cg6b1,DoubleEntendre_,2,Tue Jul 7 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"1) does swinging work for couples who have experienced infidelity? In my situation, my boyfriend carried on some online relationships into the first few months of our explicitly monogamous relationship. We have got past that but I wonder if this might bring back feelings.   To be honest, I don't know.  I've never read of anything quite like that. Trust and good communication are absolutely necessary to be able to continue a healthy relationship while swinging.  If you wonder if you're past it or not, then I'd recommend taking it slow.  Perhaps role play it first and slowly amp up from there if you enjoy that. Maybe it's something that you'll never be okay with.  Maybe it's something that needs to stay in the realm of role playing.  Maybe it's something you can explore in real life.  All of those are okay.   2) Does anyone have experience of their partner talking to others online (with consent)? My boyfriend and I both get off on the idea of the other being wanted by another person and we wanted to test the water with some online activity first, before physical.   That sounds like a good idea and you could probably find somebody pretty easily.  Sexting/Kik/Skype seem to be relatively popular with swingers here.  You could consider making a post on /r/SwingersR4R if/when you feel ready for that.  Make sure you state exactly what you're looking for.   3) Does swinging definitely not work if there is a jealous partner? I am a jealous person but weirdly, the feeling really gets me off. I was just wonder if anyone has ever mastered the jealousy and used it to their advantage or is it always negative in this situation.   I'm gonna hand the keyboard off to the girlfriend half for this one:   I used to be very traditional and jealous. I was terrified of my boyfriend cheating on me. As I grew to trust him and then have a deep, abiding love for him, that feeling evaporated. Swinging actually helped in my case. I liked the idea of another girl wanting him and enjoy seeing him with someone else since I'm so secure in our relationship and the knowledge that, at the end of the day, he will be sleeping in my bed. Supervised interactions with another girl was the way we started. Once I found I was comfortable with that, I didn't mind him going off into a bathroom with someone at a party or spending the night with a mutual friend he found attractive, as long as I got to do the same. If you're nervous about your jealousy, try being with him when he flirts with another girl, touches her, etc., and see how you feel. It can be thrilling to exchange pleased looks over the back of a stranger.   4) the stereotypical swinger is older, in my mind. I am in my early twenties (okay.. very early twenties..) and my partner is 27. Are we more likely to find older couples or..?   The age definitely swings on the older side but it may not be as bad as you think.  Here are some demographics from the survey of this subreddit.  Keep in mind that reddit skews a little young, but notice that almost 40% are between 25 and 35.  A note about age: A number of people on this subreddit tend to have negative opinions about younger folks (20s and even early 30s) looking into swinging.  Their experience is that younger couples tend to bring unnecessary drama from not having a long relationship.  Some even go so far as to write off all younger people looking into swinging.  I disagree with this sentiment, but you should know it exists."

Swingers,3cg6b1,autourbanbot,2,Tue Jul 7 19:41:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for the questions that have already been answered but I obviously have more...!  How do people go about not getting emotionally involved with others?  Is it common to not have any social contact afterwards?  Or do most people kind of find another couple that they like and stick with them?    How do you define cheating?  Is there even cheating?  I don't like the idea of having someone who is single get involved (I think it saw it referred to as a unicorn?) but do some couples split up and do their own thing so that only having another female be involved is possible? I guess I've been under the impression that it's always a couple/couples thing.  I ask because I don't feel comfortable with the idea of being touched by another guy but I have no problem with the idea of bringing in a female.
Swingers,3cg6b1,DoubleEntendre_,2,Tue Jul 7 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"How do people go about not getting emotionally involved with others? Is it common to not have any social contact afterwards? Or do most people kind of find another couple that they like and stick with them?   Depends.  For us, the ideal situation is friends with benefits, so we are okay with getting a little emotionally involved so long as the lines are clearly drawn between friend and girlfriend/boyfriend.  We admit, however, that that line is pretty thin and can be a little dangerous.  We're both on the same page, however, so that makes things easier.  I've read about people on this sub having one or a few couples they play exclusively with.  I've also read about couples who almost never play with the same couple twice.   How do you define cheating? Is there even cheating?   There can definitely be cheating.  Generally people define it as anything which undermines the mutual trust of the relationship.  If I had sex or went out on a date with somebody without discussing it with my girlfriend first would be considered cheating.  She adds that although she wouldn't be upset at the act of me having sex with another woman, but me keeping something from her would severely undermine trust.   I don't like the idea of having someone who is single get involved (I think it saw it referred to as a unicorn?) but do some couples split up and do their own thing so that only having another female be involved is possible? I guess I've been under the impression that it's always a couple/couples thing. I ask because I don't feel comfortable with the idea of being touched by another guy but I have no problem with the idea of bringing in a female.   For clarification, a unicorn is a single woman in the lifestyle, usually bisexual.    I think I understand your question.  You're saying that you're only interested in MFF threesomes but don't want that woman to be single?"
Swingers,3cg6b1,exiestjw,3,Tue Jul 7 22:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, sorry for not being more specific, I'm still learning and I'm probably not wording things correctly.  But yes, you interpreted that correctly."
Swingers,3cg6b1,STL-MO-CPL,2,Wed Jul 8 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"Nah, you communicated.  I just wanted to make sure.  That is probably do-able but will be difficult.  Again, you'll want to be upfront about that.  If you're okay with the man watching, your best bet is probably to find a couple who is into hotwife or the like."
Swingers,3cg6b1,Oregon_swingers,3,Wed Jul 8 02:57:23 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of hotwife :      A married woman she has sexual relations with other men, with the husbands approval.

Swingers,3cg6b1,DoubleEntendre_,2,Wed Jul 8 18:13:26 2015 UTC,"How do people go about not getting emotionally involved with others?   You simply control your emotions and realize that you can't control the emotions of other people.   Is it common to not have any social contact afterwards? Or do most people kind of find another couple that they like and stick with them?   There are going to be scenarios where the people involved walk in to a room without speaking and have sex, where the people involved are best buds and text eachother all day every day, and everything in between. Its whatever you like.   How do you define cheating? Is there even cheating?   Another one that only you can answer for yourself. If my wife came home and told me she fucked three guys on the way to the store, I would not care. I would get turned on and want to have sex with her. On the other hand, her immediate reaction to similar news from me would probably not have her dropping her panties.   I don't like the idea of having someone who is single get involved (I think it saw it referred to as a unicorn?) but do some couples split up and do their own thing so that only having another female be involved is possible? I guess I've been under the impression that it's always a couple/couples thing. I ask because I don't feel comfortable with the idea of being touched by another guy but I have no problem with the idea of bringing in a female.   Its not always a couple thing. The less you're willing to do, the less choices you have for easily accessing the types of sex/relationships you want. If you're attractive though, you'll easily find women only and couples where the man is willing to commence activities even though he will not be able to get intimate with you."
Swingers,3cg6b1,elizavetavl,2,Tue Jul 7 22:24:14 2015 UTC,My default answer to questions like this is to take advantage of the many fantastic podcasts on the topic that are out there.  I can list probably a dozen different swinger related podcasts.  Many of them are listed to the right.  There's so much incredible content out there for you to listen to.  The main advantage is that these episodes are usually an hour long.  The creators are able to delve deeply into whatever the topic of he show is.  Go to iTunes or whatever source you prefer and check out a few shows.  They are really good for the most part.  I listen whenever I travel for work and have hours to kill in the car.  I can't think of a better way to spend my windshield time.

There must be people out there that had partners not into the idea then changed their minds. Thanks.   This statement seems to contradict with the rest of your post.  Have you previously asked your wife about swinging and she said no?
Swingers,3cfbjk,DoubleEntendre_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"no the topic hasn't come up, I know she gets off on the idea of sex in the woods but that's something else, I would like to suggest swinging but I don't want to scare her off and would like to warm her upto the idea. how would one start, I don't want to her to think that I don't love her. she has never had sex with anyone except me as I was her first, we use toys and gels and sometimes watch vids. do you think watching vids and mentioning that the idea of her being fucked by another man turns me on?"
Swingers,3cfbjk,the_red_scimitar,2,Tue Jul 7 14:43:32 2015 UTC,"Cool! I was worried that you might be trying to change her mind and that's an entirely different question.  Here's a copy/paste from a previous topic we had on the subject.    First off, it's important that you are ready to try swinging as a couple.  There's a great post on /r/sex about group sex in committed relationships and I'm going to quote directly for signs that a couple is not ready:   You are not ready for a threesome, open relationship, swinging, etc. if:   You experience visceral feelings of hurt, jealousy, or insecurity thinking about your partner playing with someone else. You can’t discuss your wants, needs, and sexual desires openly and honestly. You are having problems in your primary relationship with trust, communication, or compatibility. You want to use swinging to “fix” your relationship. You aren’t really interested in your partner so you are using the excuse of swinging to get a chance to fuck another person (if this is the case, you probably need to reconsider your relationship altogether).      If you believe none of the above apply to you and your SO, then you're probably in a healthy jumping off place to discuss swinging (awesome!).  There are several strategies for broaching the subject.  Some people take small steps to gauge their SO's reaction.  You could mention the concept of threesomes or orgies (for example: a tv show or movie that features one of these) to get an organic reaction.  You could both take a test like mojoupgrade to see if you would both be open to the idea (along with many other ideas).  You could frankly ask your partner ""Hey, would you be interested in having sex with other people?""  Here's what we believe are important DOs and DON'Ts when discussing swinging with your SO.  DO:   Be prepared for the possibility that your SO will not feel the same way as you do and not be interested.  Approach the conversation with complete honesty.  Know some specific reasons why you are interested in swinging. Remind your SO how important he or she is to you.  You want to do this with them. Be prepared for your SO to take some time to mull things over.  Have the conversation in a time and place where you are both comfortable and stress free.   DON'T:   Discuss swinging for the first time while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Try to use swinging as a bargaining chip Be forceful or pushy with the concept of swinging.  Let your partner come to his/her conclusion in their own time."

On the side of your wife's head are two things called ears.  They can hear the noises that come from your mouth.  If you use them together, it's called communication - I suggest you try it."
Swingers,3cfbjk,Nice-Rapist,5,Tue Jul 7 14:25:14 2015 UTC,"Not helpful. Many people aren't sure what to say or ask, and even for married couples who communicate well to begin with, bringing up a possible sensitive subject can be nerve-racking."

Swingers,3cfbjk,the_real_t,2,Tue Jul 7 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"My first instinct was to reply to the OP with ""just ask her about it"".  That may seem obvious to many on this sub.  If your relationship can't handle bringing up the subject, how can it handle the actual act?   Upon further reflection, I like your idea better.  Line up a few episodes of Playboy TV Swing and watch it together.  Talk about the couples, talk about the activities in he show.  It's a natural conversation starter and you can gauge her comfort level that way.  If she's disgusted by the whole thing, just turn it off."
Swingers,3cfbjk,exiestjw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:37:32 2015 UTC,"I usually suggest that because that's actually how I was exposed to the life of swinging.  Growing up I always knew I liked girls, but I married really young, at 18 and that husband never let me explore anything sexually.  I would sneak and watch porn.  Usually swinger and girl on girl porn.  When my marriage ended, I absolutely knew that my next relationship would have to allow me to explore this LS.  I met my, now husband, and right away told him about my love for girls, and we had a threesome within probably about 4 months...ever since then we have been in the LS, now we are a full swap couple.  Going on 10 years.  =)"
Swingers,3cdvsi,lambdisposable,3,Tue Jul 7 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend checking out this subreddit's wiki for some basics about terms used in the swinging world (knowing to expect new relationship energy would have saved us some difficulty early on).  There are also some links to some old threads in there like how to approach your SO about swinging and what people's rules are.  I'd recommend giving both of those a glance.  Hopefully the mods will decide to continue the official discussions so we can get an advice thread for finding others to play with.  Personally, I'd recommend talking about why you're interested in swinging, what you do want, and what you don't want.  Do you want to have no strings attached sex?  Friends with benefits?  Are you looking for a particular kink?  It's important to realize you do this however you want to and there's no 'right' way to swing.  Communication is big.     Where do we look?     I'd recommend trying to find people online or meet and greets/clubs/parties.  We did a demographics survey a while back - most users of this subreddit find people online through swinging websites.  About half at parties or clubs.  You can use the major swinger websites to find meet and greets/clubs/parties for your area.  If you're looking for a third, rather than another couple, bars are also recommended pretty frequently here.  Here's a discussion of the most popular swinger websites. Swinglifestyle (SLS) is the most popular website for swingers right now.  It's got the largest user base and it's free so I'd recommend checking it out.  If after a while you decide to stick with swinging, I'd also recommend checking out Quiver.  It's also free, but doesn't yet have the numbers SLS does.   How do we set up accounts and maintain privacy?   Setting up accounts should be pretty easy.  Privacy wise, we don't show (or will censor) faces in our profile.  Keep in mind that people will want to see your face before they agree to meet, so have some (relatively current) pictures ready.  We also have a dedicated email for our swinger stuff.  Neither of those are necessary precautions, they just depend on the level of privacy you desire.  I haven't heard of any swinger website sharing private info so you shouldn't have to worry about that if you decide to use any of the big ones.   We aren't into clubs?   Clubs definitely aren't for everybody, but I recommend you go take a look at least once.   Is tinder valid?   Tinder is absolutely valid, and although I've never used it, it has worked out successfully from the stories I've heard.  Obviously it's good for threesomes (if you're decently attractive) and not so great for finding another couple.  If you do use it, make sure you're upfront that you're in a relationship and clear about what you're looking for.  Be prepared for a few judgmental messages and for the loss of privacy that comes with linking your facebook account.    Sorry, I know that's a huge infodump but I hope it's helpful.  Please let us know if you have any follow-up questions and keep us posted on how it goes!"

Once you put yourself in their shoes and consider what a betrayal it is, there is really no two ways about it.  About a year ago I fucked a woman a couple brought to our house. They said she and her fiancé played separately. It turned out she was only allowed to play with other women and he wasn't playing at all. So now we were put in a position where we were keeping other people's secrets. Fuck that! We told the three of them that she either came clean to her boyfriend or she was banned from our house, hanging out with us, etc. We haven't seen her since and I'm pretty sure our friends dropped her.   We think cheaters are like people who kick dogs. They are people who ask themselves ""Should I knowingly hurt this person I profess to love?"" And answered ""Yes!"" Dick move."
Swingers,3ccha8,curiouscpl702,3,Tue Jul 7 12:26:11 2015 UTC,"I understand not wanting to feel like you're enabling someone to be unfaithful, but at the end of the day he's going to do whatever he wants, with or without you. You can't assume blame for the way he chooses to conduct his life. That being said, it's a good time to evaluate how you feel about the situation so you can act accordingly. As others have mentioned, this is quite common in the lifestyle and tends to increase the potential trouble. If the idea of what you suspect he's up to makes you uncomfortable, then you need to move on. Confronting him about it is not ever going to lead to anything good, so I wouldn't bother.  It's also probably a good time to point out that people in this lifestyle have many reasons to hide personal details, not all of which are nefarious. If I caught someone digging through my wallet, I would (rightfully) feel violated and would be pissed. You've crossed a line with that action that clearly indicates you already have very little respect for the guy, if at all. The appropriate & mature thing to do when someone triggers your warning radar is to walk away. You shouldn't need to gather evidence to trust your instincts, nor do you need to justify them by proving they are correct."
Swingers,3ccha8,notourrealnames,4,Mon Jul 6 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, bullshit. The cheating prick already lies about being a married cheating prick. Should they trust what he says about his STD status or whoever else he's fucking, and how safe he's being?  You must be new here. Not long ago, there was a Redditor who went by the name Alpha_Bull_Vegas who traveled around the US fulfilling hotwife and swinging couples' fantasies.   He said his wife had suffered a stroke and was disabled. Surprise, that was bullshit. As it happened, his hobbies included bareback gangbangs with strangers behind his wife's back, and IIRC he was fucking married female Redditors without condoms on occasion.   My point is that there are scurvy motherfuckers on the Internet who will lie about everything to get ass, even to the point of endangering decent kinky people's health.

My point is, if you're having fun, and it's just about sex rather than a long term friendship, this might not be something that matters.  If you do want to forge a long term friendship, you are concerned about an angry wife, or it bothers you from a moral standpoint, then it's time to take to a step back.  Hence my question."

It's important to set clear expectations together - if you don't, you're asking to be hurt."
Swingers,3cced1,NWBoomer,5,Tue Jul 7 20:18:43 2015 UTC,"He broke the ground rules and that's bad.  OK.  He didn't have sex with anyone.  OK.  You acting like it's the end of the world?  Not OK.  Address the trust issues, fix them and move on with life.    I'm assuming he's not 16, so I'm not too clear on the curfew or why that's the big issue.  ""Honey, enjoy your threesome but remember you're on a timer.  Go have a good time!!!""  I think I can see why he had trouble getting up for the event."
Swingers,3cced1,the_real_t,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:02:11 2015 UTC,"The ""curfew"" was the agreed-upon time for him to come home that we both decided TOGETHER. I'm not his mom. He PROMISED to be home by that time. Breaking a promise is the problem. His word being shit (intentionally or not) is the problem."
Swingers,3cced1,the_real_t,-2,Thu Jul 9 21:22:28 2015 UTC,He's actually always had trouble getting it up for anyone but me in these situations :::shrug:::

I'm leaning towards no based on this input and the fact that he didn't enjoy the hell out of the amazing present you gave him.  You guys need to get a bottle of wine, a quiet place and have a really long, honest talk.  In my opinion anyway."
Swingers,3cced1,MMABouncer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"See, he acts REALLY into the idea of group sex IN THEORY, then it comes time to actually do it and he freezes up. He really is VERY shy and reserved.  And we do need to talk about it, but no bottle of wine. I'm sober."

Hopefully you (meaning both of you) can work out why he's good up until game time and get the trust issues fixed.  When everyone and everything is firing on all cylinders, amazing times can be had and you deserve a shot at that.  If swinging isn't meant to be, then I hope you both recognize it and enjoy your lives together."
Swingers,3cced1,quanchompy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:08:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I have to repeat - I would have been fine on the trust front if he had been home when we agreed, or at least had texted or called and said the night was running long. Really, he was just recklessly careless, not malicious.  I really thought by giving him the chance to have an opportunity without me might help build his confidence, but it backfired. He might really only be into it in theory and it's just part of dirty talk :::shrug:::"
Swingers,3cced1,donkey90745,5,Sat Jul 11 15:06:38 2015 UTC,"I hope I am not coming across as judgmental, but in our experience, alcohol and swinging are NOT a good mix. It sounds like you have several parallel issues going on, the alcohol being one, lack of communication being another, and trust issues. You two might need to take a time-out and ascertain where your relationship is going."
Swingers,3cced1,LionAndMonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:57:57 2015 UTC,"See, my experience in swinging is that mostly everyone gets wasted at clubs and parties before they even interact. I wish it wasn't that way."
Swingers,3cced1,firesofolympus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"My wife feels that is someone has to get drunk to lower their inhibitions to swing, they shouldn't be swinging. And alcohol has a distinctively negative effect on male performance. Don't get me wrong, we have booze at our parties, but people drink pretty socially... and fuck that way as well."
Swingers,3cced1,LionAndMonkey,10,Fri Jul 10 01:37:31 2015 UTC,"It was interesting to read all the context here...and there is a lot going on behind the scenes obviously (alcoholism, trust issues, jealousy, ownership, etc.) but this isn't the right space to break all that stuff down.  You feel hurt and I think that's justified. You set some simple ground rules and he broke them.  I also understand how he feels - for once he is the one desired. It's rare for a guy to get that, because as you've noticed in the scene, it's the women who usually have the attention and all the opportunity.  What I don't understand it the monumental rage and hurt you feel. It's a bit of a non-sequter to me to go from that situation to the level of anger, hurt and angst you've communicated here. I'm not judgeing you for your feelings, they are valid. But the response is not in direct proportion to the ""crime"".  This leads me to think that there is more at play here, deeper issues that have been triggered. My advice is to step back, realise he is sorry (he's said it multiple times and it's not your place to judge how ""real"" or ""proper"" his apology is) and then try to figure out what is going on inside you to have this strong of a reaction. Objectively, what he did was certainly a dick move, but it's not relationship threatening. So there is something more going on with you. Good luck"
Swingers,3cced1,notourrealnames,-1,Mon Jul 6 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"Being incommunicado is an ongoing issue with him.   I think learning how to give a proper apology (one where you verbally acknowledge what you did wrong, admit fault, make amends, specifically ask for forgiveness) is key in any relationship. Just yelling ""I'm sorry!"" at me is almost worse than not apologizing."

Swingers,3cced1,pilllogical,3,Tue Jul 7 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people seem to think being angry about rule violation is bad.  It's basic to a relationship to have boundaries and rules that are mutually agreed upon.  Doesn't matter what the content of the rules is, being in the relationship means agreeing to and keeping them.  If you can't handle the rules you talk it out and modify them or you leave.  Just ignoring them because they are inconvenient is shitty behavior, and the silliness of the rules is utterly irrelevant to that.  You are right that it is disrespectful to you and to the relationship.  It's clear you two have issues that need to be resolved, but fully justified anger at disrespect and rule violation isn't part of the problem."
Swingers,3cced1,wifeisn2girls2,2,Wed Jul 8 16:31:55 2015 UTC,Thank you. We sat down TOGETHER and came up with the boundaries and expectations for the evening. I didn't impose them on him.

He also needs to listen without minimizing your feelings.  However, (and this might sound a little dismissive) if these types of offenses and broken rules cause you to fall off the horse (assuming you're not looking for the next excuse to do so anyway), then I think you both need some actual therapy. That will help you both acquire some skills for effective communication."
Swingers,3c9zzr,golden-weiner,15,Mon Jul 6 07:03:37 2015 UTC,"We are currently organizing one for my wife. And is scheduled for the end of this month.  It is alot of work.  I've been placing posts on reddit.com,  fetlife.com and even started a local community in Kasidie.com.     We use kik and kasidie.com to chat and exchange pictures so she can decide if she wants to meet them.   We have scheduled 2 meet and greets. It's a good way to weed out any creeps and smelly guys. Plus we are new to the city we live in and don't have a reliable group of playmates to choose from. First meet and greet had 8 rsvps 4 showed up. The next one looks to be around the same.  We will invite around 10 people, and are hoping at least 4 show up.   We always ask the questions: do you have experience with group sex? And are you in a relationship.  Guys that haven't been naked around other guys since high school gym class might have a difficult time performing. Also, the last thing we want is a suspicious wife to follow her husband to the gangbang and cause drama.   (I was surprised by the number of responses, ""I'm married and my wife doesn't know that Im a perv""). a good way to find this out is by asking for a face pic. Which we prefer over dick pics.  I (husband) do all the coordinating and communication.  If someone on fetlife messages my wife, she directs them to me. If I can chat with them and they aren't just looking for pictures, ask the wife if she wants to meet him. If yes, I give him the details for the meet and greet and hope he is smart enough to show up. If not, I say ""sorry you are not her type""  At the meet and greet we go over all the rules/wants and donts. Which are up to you.  Likely the husband won't be able to participate since someone will need to monitor the event and make sure the rules are followed.  If you are on any of the sites/services I mentioned. I can go over some of the steps in more detail  Good luck"

Swingers,3c9zzr,RoseBud_1965,7,Mon Jul 6 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"In addition to Kasidie.com, mentioned in another post, I would suggest SwingLifestyle.com (SLS). We've generally had better luck on SLS.   For our first, we did a submissive gang bang.  I (M) selected all the guys from Kasidie and SLS, since this was our I made sure that all had recent certs and pictures on their profiles. Ruling out any Free accounts. We arranged to meet the finalists at a nearby bar. We played pool and chatted for an hour or so. She was not submissive at the bar, and was allowed to reject any of the guys that she didn't like.  (She didn't reject any.) She was submissive as soon as we left the bar; they followed us to our place (you may want to consider a hotel room) where we had the GB. I let them know that she would forget to take a potty break before leaving the bar, so they all plied her with drinks at the bar -- she then had to ask get their permission to pee after the party started...   (If you say you were referred by RoseBud_1965 on Kasidie or SLS you will get a free trial on both boards. Fetlife is free. Disclaimer: Yes, if you decide to become a paid member we get some small kickback.)  For a hotel be careful you won't have too many guests and run afoul of the front desk. You may want to consider a motel with access that isn't through a lobby.  Fetlife, mentioned in a comment, is also a good source -- however, I would not recommend it for your first party. Many of the people, that we've met, on FL are newbies to swinging, whereas, with a little screening, on Kasidie and SLS you are less likely to have someone with no experience. We've never had any problems with anyone from Kasidie or SLS, but have had issues with two people from FL (that said, we've also met some great playmates and friends from FL, so ...)  I would recommend that, as you confirm people, you email them guidelines and rules (i.e. condoms for penetration, no anal, etc. -- whatever you have decided). Then email a reminder of the rules and details on where to meet the day of the event. In both emails, give them a way to contact you if the must flake (though many won't), play up how much fun this will be, and let them know she is counting on them (guilt factor can increase your turnout).   Then as they assemble, go over any rules again. If you're using condoms (hopefully) make sure to have some on hand -- an amazing number of guys ""forget"" them, along with some lube that she likes.  We host frequent GB's and expect about a 50% turnout (that means half the guys flake! Couples are worse). If you are working with guys directly via email through the boards, and do your homework (eliminate newbies) you should only get 10-20% flakes.  As the other commenter mentioned, the husband usually does not participate. I don't at most our parties, unless the group is manageable and I'm comfortable with everyone.  Most of all Enjoy!"

Swingers,3c9zzr,RoseBud_1965,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:47:13 2015 UTC,Glad to help. Feel free to hit us up with any other questions.
Swingers,3c8pyu,hopeitgetsbetta,5,Sun Jul 5 23:16:16 2015 UTC,"We got into swinging because, even though our sex life was good, it got a bit predictable. Now years and countless partners later, we still find the best sex we have is with each other. We feel the swinging experience has enhanced our relationship on many levels.   To answer your question more directly; again we have done some experimentation together. Swinging generally doesn't involve much in the way of BDSM, so we have played with mild restraints, a bit of soft flogging. One thing that I do is half the time my wife and I play I will wear a condom. Now I am 100% condom user with swinger friends, but using one with my wife kind of suggests swinging to me, it's a different feel and a turn on. Another thing we are trying is sexy ""situations"" like I can sometimes (rarely) convince her to go out to dinner where she wears a dress with no panties underneath. Really gets me charged.   There are things you likely do with your partner you don't with other swingers; focus on those special forms of intimacy you don't extend to others."
Swingers,3c8pyu,NWBoomer,2,Sun Jul 5 23:54:02 2015 UTC,"Yes we had reached kind of the same predictability awhile back but swinging has definitely spiced it up & we really enjoy that aspect.   I am interested in BDSM but agree it's not huge in swinging scene (or, in my experience, it's an all or nothing thing with one side of the party being a closed off section full-on into that, a bit intimidating to wander into!). So maybe that is something we can have a conversation about.  I like your idea on focusing on the special intimacy not shared with others – good takeaway message. Appreciate your thoughts (also love the no panties at dinner out.. ha! ;)  Thanks for the tips! :)"
Swingers,3c8pyu,YoureNotWearingASlip,2,Mon Jul 6 08:05:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, so my first answer before reading your whole post was ""We SWING!"" but taking that answer off the table, I would recommend doing things to help the relationship.  Not that there's anything wrong with your relationship, but really great sex comes from when you're blissfully happy just being together, and sometimes stupid things like work or family stress can encroach on that in ways that have nothing to do with your compatibility or communication or even sex drive.  Figure out what makes you happy, non-sexually, and try to pursue some of that more.  Maybe try to cut back on hours at work, or push back on family members or friends that are cutting into your ""you"" time.  Make sure you're not neglecting some of your own needs for sacrificial reasons - like maybe you're saving up for something big so you're denying yourself some simple pleasures like a starbucks in the morning or something.  Just try to up the ""contentedness"" factor in your lives, and I'll bet spontaneous sex starts happening again."
Swingers,3c8pyu,libertoonz,2,Mon Jul 6 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"A few days ago I posted a note about how swinging did solve one specific problem in our marriage -- the sex had gotten boring after 25 years of monogamy. In all other ways our relationship was great, but we needed help in this one way. Especially because 1) we like different things sexually, (as we've discovered over the years), and 2) the grooves carved by repetition over the years make it very hard to try new things whole-heartedly.  Swinging helped our private sex life in two ways. First, it does knock you out of those grooves, and you really are forced to try new things with new people. You then bring home those new things and try them with each other. We are now much less frustrated with each other sexually, not only because of the outside experiences, but also because we are having sex with each other differently, decreasing our incompatibility.  Second, having sex with new people is so exciting. After one particularly great party, we came home and had great sex because we were still so turned on by our evening. And lately, while we have sex, we talk about sex we've had with other people -- that's working for us too.  If swinging works for you, and it seems to, then bring it into bed with you, even when you are by yourselves."

We are super new too and haven't gone anywhere yet either, but here's what we have found is out here:  Couples Oasis: which is a private residence I believe, like a huge house, maybe a mini mansion. Idk. It's here.  Purrfect Lv does take over parties, but more in hotel room suites on the Strip and looks like it would be pretty fun, idk if play is allowed or if they would want you to go get rooms elsewhere as T&A have said in their podcasts.   New Temptations is a club we get invited to on SLS a lot since we're locals. The website layout is horrible and we couldn't find any reviews so we kinda wrote it off till we hear more, I guess we just call if we have any questions.  Risqu is a private residence. A bigger 70s era house by the looks of the photos. It sounds ALOT like Temptations but they clearly point out all over the site it's a private residence and not a club. It seems very relaxed and laid back. We liked that they have photos and show you what to expect. We both agreed this is the place we would prob want to go to first, hopefully by and of summer we get babysitters ourselves and check it out.

We've been to the perfect party takeovers many times when they were at the hard rock and the. At the riviera.  They had to move again since the riv closed but hey were fun, just too expensive for us. They had to sell the hotels alcohol so it would just get too expensive. The crowd wasn't bad though.   Couples Oasis is similar to the red rooster but for couples only. It's a house party. Not a bad scene, just a bit cliquish sometimes. You have to be a member to attend.   Risqué looks nice from the site but I can't say I've been there, so I won't review it.   The green Door is mostly a tourist trap as I mentioned before it looks nice but I never see anyone there.   I've been to more of them but I don't remember their names.

Did you taste it?  I wouldn't recommend doing that. I'm going to bet you've never actually been there and you really just work for one of the other scam clubs.

Remodeled the upstairs, the entrance and the bar area...  New entertainment and some Saturday's they even have a live band with a couple of porn stars playing and a few more walking around. Also, there are signs that state prostitution isn't allowed but if some old guy walks in with a prostitute on his arm, how are they to know? And how does that effect you anyway?

Sleeping with people who are swingers because they are just looking for sex is like someone selling weed outside of a dispensary because everyone is there for the same thing. Sorry to be rude about it dude. Post a pic and your experiences on /r/r4r /r/randomactsofblowjobs /r/swinger4r  if your attractive and seem genuine, I would think you may get some attention, specially in Vegas.   Sorry for the double standard since single women are encouraged/allowed. I would assume it's because most single guys come across as not carrying about the other person and just getting off without any work."

Swingers,3c6ybz,IsThatYourElbow,2,Mon Jul 6 05:36:53 2015 UTC,That answer kind of sucks. Everyone likes what they like. It's not call dating if it's a threesome or more-some. How about give him the info he asked for since at some swingers clubs single males are allowed and even encouraged. We have had many encounters with very respectful single males. Places like the green door and the red rooster allow single males. So do most of the others. At the red rooster single males aren't allowed in the entire club though.
Swingers,3c6ybz,alankesslering,2,Mon Jul 6 05:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was a douchy response. You are right. What he is looking for isn't bad, I was surprised to hear he is looking to watch and just be around sexiness. Then fact that he's young prob works for his favor, that's why I said post with a photo.

Swingers,3c4wcv,hotwifeama,4,Sat Jul 4 20:34:12 2015 UTC,I agree.  We are in the same spot in Seattle.  When life is busy its incredibly hard to find something that fits just right.
Swingers,3c4wcv,TeamTrouble,2,Sat Jul 4 21:43:07 2015 UTC,I sympathize with this. My boyfriend and I are in long distance relationship. We have a week together every few months in which we can play with other couples. There isn't a lot of wiggle room planning wise.
Swingers,3c4wcv,motorbikebeat,2,Sun Jul 5 01:24:39 2015 UTC,"I would give this piece of advice - I don't know about you and your partner, but a lot of couples get too ""excited"" when they find a potential match. I've talked to plenty of cute couples that got too enthusiastic or jump-the-gun-giddy about meeting up - a huge turn off. I can understand a potential find is exciting, especially after a dry spell, but don't happy-vomit over potential matches. For example, talked to a nice gal who was obviously thrilled to meet a bi woman/man combo for her and her husband. Immediately she kept saying ""give us a chance!"" Or ""we're really great i promise just meet us once!"" I had full intentions of meeting them but got increasingly turned off the more she tried to sell herself. Another couple had the same issue. They were so excited to meet a ""unicorn"" they forgot how to play the game of seduction and attraction."
Swingers,3c4wcv,-missnyankitty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:14:47 2015 UTC,"Not really. I mean we have a lot of experience with threesomes/ meeting other people, so it's not the type of thing that we get super excited about.  We just found that couples online are either looking for the same night/week end as we usually need 1-2 weeks to plan it out. Whenever we start planning, after 2 weeks (talking on and off) one of us usually cuts communication."

Swingers,3c4wcv,bortzu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"Same boat here. We see this as an enhancement to our regular life and not the primary focus of it, and we're often stuck between two types of people we meet that just don't work for us. We either meet the lifestyle as primary social life type people that are looking bored they aren't fucking you within a half hour of meeting, the couples that you just don't click with on a personality level, or the couples that are brand new to all of this and need a lot of handholding to take the next step and you're not even sure they ever will. We're understanding and patient, but at a certain point we came to have sex not make new best friends so we've taken to avoiding the newbies.   I think your position is really normal so don't be frustrated. Many of us are just looking for a few couples we really love to hang out with and have fun with. The problem is finding and keeping them (we've had great friend couples in the past that have moved, broken up, stopping playing because of kids, all that) and finding them can be extra hard as it's basically two people trying to date two people, so regular dating but 4 times as hard as each person, even the dudes, have to get along and like each other.   It gets frustrating but keep at it, eventually you'll come across someone you really like and click with :)"

In the back area the single guys were walking around some but we never saw them ask to join anyone, more of just watching little and waiting to be asked and then moving on if not. We have been twice and both were Friday nights where single guys were allowed. It did seem that around midnight the number of single guys increased dramatically but still not overwhelming."

If you want to get more technical, you can set up a WordPress blog on your own hosting account using Dreamhost or something. That'll give you total control over layout, etc. Tumblr is really good, though."
Swingers,3c5m5g,alfred_the_flowery,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:06:47 2015 UTC,"Tumblr is probably the right answer, but in the interest of completeness I'll add that wordpress.com is another option. It gets you much of the power of the Wordpress engine, while removing some of the complexity and hassle of self-hosting. There are still way too many options, but at least there are a million and one guides out there to help you.  Sticking within one of the bigger networks (Google's Blogger, Tumblr, Wordpress)  means that there will be a few more ways for people to discover you, beyond random Google searches or whatever. Depending on what you want, that may or may not be worth considering.  Good luck, OP! Post a URL when you have something you're happy with."
Swingers,3c3bxp,pavlovslog,7,Sat Jul 4 10:33:00 2015 UTC,"""It's been a pleasure meeting you, but no thank you."" is what we say.  Honesty in the lifestyle is a must if it's gone on too long.  Observers during a party, especially in the open areas is tough.  It will kill the moment for all involved.  We just ignore, and have a good laugh at their expense afterword.  If they touch without being invited, that elevates the issue."
Swingers,3c3bxp,the_TX,2,Sat Jul 4 11:12:11 2015 UTC,Yea it's a bit weird. We will be forthright but not 110% blunt and it honestly doesn't do the job. The one time we were that blunt it was super weird as the couple was all dejected and kept giving us weird looks and eventually came to ask us why we rejected them. Cringe-worthy.
Swingers,3c3bxp,playswell,2,Sat Jul 4 19:08:43 2015 UTC,"We've never minded the observers.  In fact, we LOVE to be watched.  However, when they break into personal conversations distracting from the mood, we just want to smack them."
Swingers,3c3bxp,NotReallyBi,2,Sat Jul 4 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"Yea we don't mind that much either and do enjoy being watched when the mood is right for it, but it's distracting when they are unwelcome and hanging around the edges with the hopes of jumping in when everything is full on and people aren't paying attention. Reminds us too much of a dog laying low on the edge of the table hoping some scraps fall off the table so they can snap them while everyone is busy and not noticing."
Swingers,3c3bxp,riverthrowaway,2,Sun Jul 5 06:53:06 2015 UTC,"We love the party environment but understand your issues.    The clingers issue is difficult but as you are seeing you have to be much more direct and much more curt with some folks to get the message across.  We're not trying to hurt others feelings but wasting our nights with clingers sucks.    It happens to all of us in the beginning, just be less polite and move on.  ""Nice meeting you, we're going to mingle with the other couples here"" usually works for us as we turn our backs to them and ignore them.  They usually get the hint at that point.    Most clubs have private rooms, find them, and use them.  Group/open rooms with no doors that behavior is standard protocol at every swingers club we have ever been to.  People love to watch, we dislike being watched unless its just the two of us.  With 4 or 6 people we find the peanut gallery distracting as the comments and without fail some stranger will try and get a grope.    Find a play room with a locking door.    The clingers issue will resolve itself over time, as you become regulars and not ""fresh meat""."
Swingers,3c3bxp,ThepoonDr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:18:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, I think you're right we just need to first decide if the party scene is for us and if we decide to keep at it just refine out tactics. I'm sure over time we'll get it together but in the start it's really frustrating especially when you have to pay $100 or more a couple depending on party and then you spend your whole time dodging people until you finally go home."
Swingers,3c3bxp,dillydallydelve,2,Sun Jul 5 18:18:58 2015 UTC,"The GF and I feel pretty much the same way about parties. Too many random couples who are complete strangers, a lot of people we would have nothing to do with ordinarily, clingers, watchers, and people who are way to drunk for their own good.   Saying no is one thing, but I would prefer not to be in a position where we need to say no. For us there is a line between a group of people we know and trust and the kind of party where we just feel weirded out all night. The difference between 10 couples we have met previously and like vs. 20 couples where we only know a few other people makes all the difference in the world. I can understand how some people would enjoy that bigger, more social, environment, but it isn't for us.  So etiquette aside, I guess what I am trying to say is that parties like this aren't for everyone, and there is nothing wrong with finding them the wrong environment and that you have to do what is most comfortable for you to have a good time."
Swingers,3c3bxp,Oregon_swingers,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:19:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply and I think we're in the same boat as you. We enjoy some aspects of the party but a huge aspect of this for us is the flirting and getting to know the other couple. At a party that really doesn't happen for us as it feels like you have to do so many intros and talking and we're more concerned with sizing them up for compatibility quickly rather than really taking the time to get to know them. It's good to know though its not just us as so many of the couples we meet at these seem to be so gung-ho about the party scene that we're left wondering if it's just us or what.

Turns out there's a lot of fun you can have with your hands, and just flirting. ;)  Honestly, it's just nice to be out with people where, if you bring up sex, just in general, it's not an awkward topic. We all have sex, and it's fun to actually have it be an option of conversation! Not that the converstation has to be ALL about the sexy stuff, but it is nice to be able to have that on the table as opposed to off.   We, too, like the sexy vibe of the scene, without having to completely dive in. And so far, we've been up front with people, and everyone has been really cool.

Swingers,3bzuho,PlsInsertGirder,4,Fri Jul 3 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"It's not unrealistic, but it is hard to find, I think. When my wife and I (50s) started out, two years ago, we wanted people like us, and people that we would be friends with. That just seemed so obvious. As things progressed, we were surprised that we enjoyed one-time meetings, at least in limited quantities. We were surprised that we clicked with people who were very unlike us. In fact, we were almost exclusive with one couple very unlike us for a year, and it was just incredible. Non-sex socializing with them was limited -- they like some activities, we liked different ones for the most part. But we did enjoy many weekends together that included lots of sex and lots of hanging out, eating and drinking. They introduced us to another long-term couple, and we are much more compatible with them. I think we've been lucky. I hear that it is very unusual to find another couple where the 4-way attraction is there, and lasts.  When you say you want to be involved with one couple, is that because it's what you want, or because you are overwhelmed by the effort involved? One website should be sufficient, (SLS works for us, much as I hate it). It does take time to get started, but that effort should lessen over time. Also, don't rule out couples that you see just for sex (one-time or long-term), you might like it."

And we lucked out with 3 different great couples ( all different ages) who we consider to be our friends with benefits. We see these couples sometimes just for drinks and a movie as if playing happens (usually does ;) ) then that's great but if not then we had a good dinner/drinks with friends. None of these couples know each other but we are able to maintain good friendships with all 3 couples, everyone has busy lives so sometimes we see our friends every couple weeks or monthly or sometimes every couple months.

For example, we've met a couple a few times who were really fun/hot, and we would swap, but later I realized that myself and the woman had very little chemistry at all. But for my wife, it's one of the best partners she's ever had. On their end everything seems fine, but we have this imbalance on our end now which makes things awkward, because they were really fun as friends. We've been out of the country for a few months but we're still trying to figure out how to resolve this one when we get back :)  A more extreme example... We became really, really close for several months with a funny, gorgeous, amazing couple. Did everything together, hung out every weekend. Things took a bad turn when the other woman decided she loved us and wanted to pursue a polyamorous relationship. We were on board with it for a bit, but it was hugely complicated, and if we were honest with ourselves, it wasn't what we were looking for and we should have put the brakes on a lot earlier. Eventually my wife and I became divided by it, it was very stressful, and our marriage felt like it was going to fall apart over it. Again, VERY EXTREME AND UNLIKELY EXAMPLE! We just had to completely cut ties with them, and haven't spoken since, which is really a shame. Ever since, we've been a lot more wary of getting too close, too quickly to another couple. For us, it was like the complications of dating one person, but spread across the connections between 4 people."

Not only between your partner and yourself, but among all parties. Becoming friends is excellent, and a desirable aspect for many couples- but boundaries need to exist in LS friendships, just like they do in vanilla friendships. Sometimes, because we add sex into the mix, those lines are blurred if not directly and explicitly laid out- which creates drama and ill-feelings toward the entire life. I read this comment, and could have sworn it was my very own earlier LS experience coming back to haunt me."

Swingers,3bzuho,NerdyandDirty4fun,0,Mon Jul 6 03:10:25 2015 UTC,"You will see a lot of this on the websites, couples saying they want to be friends first and then move it into the bedroom and it isn't uncommon at all. It is telling, in our opinion, as to the experience level of the couple.   That is not meant as a bad thing. We just find that newer couples tend to focus more on the friendship first aspect, probably because they are still a little timid and nervous and making friends with another couple adds an element of familiarity that makes newer couples feel safer in a new, scary experience.   What I can say as the male half of a couple with 9 years experience in the lifestyle is that we have met with many ""Friends First"" couples. To date, we have not stayed friends with any of them and we find that the focus that they put on being friends first just adds to a stressful situation.   On the flip side of that coin, some of our best lifestyle friends are couples that we have met at a club or party, fucked, and then exchanged numbers with. I know this might seem counter-intuitive, but it is so much easier to grow into good friends when the sexual chemistry is hot and spicy rather than trying to be friends with couples where the chemistry fizzles."

Swingers,3bxkm0,karmacorpse,3,Fri Jul 3 12:13:18 2015 UTC,"For my wife, the trigger was information; reading up on swinging culture. There are some good books that convinced her to try going to a club. Our agreement between us was that we would try the club three times, go there with no expectations, observe. Our first night we met a great couple and we were fully involved from there on.   For my wife the concept that it is a women-controlled activity, no means No and she has full control over what does and does not happen was the key for her. When the woman reaches a point where she feels she can express her sexuality in compete safety and fully supported by her spouse, there will be no stopping her. Good luck."

If you have grown up in a traditional conservative Midwest environment (I'm assuming Midwest due to your username), you may have several decades of social conditioning that is preventing your wife from letting loose and allowing herself to explore her true interests.  There's a lot of shame, guilt, embarrassment, etc. that comes with that 24/7 pressure to be straight as an arrow and 100% monogamous.  For some people, it's really hard to break free of that and be honest with their true selves.  Be gentle, be supportive, and do what /u/SwapFu says - ""take it slow and keep talking"".  That's solid advice right there."
Swingers,3bxicj,sexymoose,2,Thu Jul 2 23:39:02 2015 UTC,"There is a TV show on the American cable TV channel Cinemax called ""Skin To The Max"".

I don't think they specifically identified Okinawa or not, but it's worth checking out if you have video on demand or something like that.  It's a shot in the dark, thought it might be worth a try for you.  Good luck."
Swingers,3bwdsj,spexer,5,Thu Jul 2 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"My wife and I started out as Soft Swap (many couples do). It is a great way to test out jealousy.  We were both very jealous people and we worried about everything being potentially upsetting, even kissing.   We decided that we would try Soft Swap - for us, that meant kissing, touching and oral. No sex with the other person.   We agreed that:   We couldn't hold anything against each other for doing anything within the agreed upon boundaries.  Nothing happens outside of each others view.   Save the drama for after the couple leaves. Can call it quits at any time. (This can be simply asking for everyone to stop and apologizing and saying you feel uncomfortable - it doesn't have to be a big drams filled explosion).    We felt that there wasn't anything that would happen in Soft Swap that we couldn't get over. If you got jealous over kissing or oral sex, well, now you know this stuff isn't for you. No need to try anything else. But it seemed small enough that we could move on after, even if it was upsetting.   Talk about what you both want and don't want. You have to be honest. If sitting on the side watching your wife with another girl sounds boring, tell her. Doing something you aren't interested in or something you don't want to just leads to resentment and anger.   I would be hesitant about doing this with friends.  If things go badly or it is a really bad experience,  you just ruined your friendship.  Join a swinger site and go try things out with strangers. If things don't work out you walk away and move on.   Good luck."
Swingers,3bwdsj,FeetInTheWater,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:02:38 2015 UTC,This is all great advice if you're going to go down this path.  I can't think of anything else of value to add.  /u/FeetInTheWater pretty much said it all.  Edit - I have concerns about the perceived unfairness of the situation between you and your wife.  User /u/wifeisn2girls2 pointed that out in his reply.  My comments here assume that you were on more equal footing.
Swingers,3bwdsj,STL-MO-CPL,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:27:45 2015 UTC,"I am concerned too.  one the one hand, I want to be open to her exploring herself and her interest (and awakening sexually), and I don't want her freaking out about me making out with a girl as part of the deal that could completely overwhelm her and shut all of this down.  However on the other side, this starts our new phase in an unequal relationship. A power shift that could lead to cuckolding, which is not my interest.  And I got that vibe pretty strong when the wives were chatting and presented an idea of all of them going to vegas together for a girls trip (and exploring each other). The other husbands were pretty quiet, but I spoke up saying it would be a fun trip if we ALL go, but no to just the girls going.  My wife was cool with that, but the other wives were a little surprised to get the no."
Swingers,3bwdsj,wifeisn2girls2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"I like your additional agreements, and will go over them with my wife before our next encounter. She got pretty jealous at the strip club when a stripper climbed on to me to give me a shot... but I think it was the shock of it - she told me later that she thought she would be cool with it until she saw me getting into it. Perhaps it will just take time and more exposure to loosen her up.  It is interesting that it was after this stripper occurrence, the first time she saw someone on me after 15 years of marriage, that later that night with a few more drinks she started making out with the wives.  Will have to analyze the psychology of that sometime..."
Swingers,3bwdsj,flwrsme,2,Fri Jul 3 14:39:18 2015 UTC,"So, from her point of view, it's perfectly fine for her to fuck around outside of the relationship, but it's not ok for you to have that same freedom. Is that correct?  We started out very similar however when my wife realized how selfish that was she began to allow me, in very small increments, to be more involved with other girls. It started off with her allowing me to get lap dances, and then progressed to me being allowed to make out with the other girl a little kissing, light petting. And then progressed to oral. After about 2 years of making small incremental changes to our rules, slowly slowly progressing, we eventually became comfortable with full swap.  It's actually extremely liberating. We were both jealous people and thought that that would be the huge issue for us. But ultimately this leads to eliminating jealousy from your relationship, and we feel like we are happier and more content because of it.  Personally, I'd only agree to continue down the road you're on now if she understand that her current position is extremely selfish, and she agrees to slowly progress to the point where you can participate, at least a little."

Swingers,3bwdsj,wifeisn2girls2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i would say that we too have been fairly shocked to find that swinging has been extremely helpful at reducing any sense of jealousy in general.  It has certainly been a very welcome side effect of being in the Lifestyle."
Swingers,3bwdsj,iamthrowingthisawayt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:02:56 2015 UTC,"your perspective is very similar and most welcome. Your story of how it progressed and where you are today gives me hope and excitement for a good outcome.   Were you concerned about the unequal footing when you got started? Was the pressure you placed on her about, how eventually, you would get to play too.. did that slow down her progression and interest? were there any challenges  / setbacks or problems with your journey I should watch out for? you say you now full swap. How did she progress from liking girls to then being with other men? I believe I am comfortable with her being with other women, (giving it a try), but as of right now I am not with her being with other men. A natural concern would be that her interest and excitement exceed beyond my comfort zone, where she will then be open for and want something that I am not yet cool with. I know she would honor my NO, but then havent we created a situation where she has desires unfulfilled, frustration and resentment, and maybe even the spark to step outside of the marriage... where if we dont go down this path the genie is kept in the bottle, and these thoughts and desires are left unrealized? I hope this is a natural concern and thought for someone entertaining this path."

I wouldnt expect a lot of helpful responses. Youre in LA, you can check the back pages of the LA weekly.   And I was being somewhat serious. What youre asking about is hiring a woman to play the role of a unicorn. Im not sure if you understand what a unicorn actually is, which is a woman in the swinging scene that is looking to hook up with a couple. Escorts, unlike unicorns, are not hard to come by."
Swingers,3bwhi3,usewhippedcream,5,Thu Jul 2 21:28:04 2015 UTC,"OK, here are my thoughts on it. First a little background. I was in a dead bedroom marriage for basically 18 years and in the last years of it communication was gone, we were basically roommates. I was literally going out of my mind from lack of intimacy, both physical and emotional and at one point I did A LOT of thinking about and research into hiring a prostitute. I had plenty of disposable income and my wife was clueless about the family finances. I had a job that didn't care if I took off for an hour or two here and there. And mostly I was starved for sex.  I never actually did it as ultimately I decided that I needed more than just sex in my life. And in the end I decided that divorce and a fresh start gave me a better shot at being a happy healthy whole human being.  There are ways of doing it discreetly and safely though.  First forget about Craigslist and Backpage. Most of those ads are fake, scams or plants for law enforcement. You need to get into a network of trust. There is a website called preferred411.com that acts as a clearing house for providers. They will verify your identity and you will pay a hefty annual fee to get on their whitelist. Then you will need to actually meet some of the girls and a lot of them won't deal with newbs. Then you need to actually engage the services of one that will provide the level of service you and your SO are seeking. A lot of them will not come to you, they want to host for their own safety and security and I can hardly blame them.   You probably would be better off travelling to a place prostitution is legal honestly.   Edit: And yeah, hiring a pro is not swinging, if you decide to go that way I think you might find that it is basically a business transaction, without any of the fun and charge that comes from a lusty encounter with a willing participant."
Swingers,3bwhi3,dalore,4,Fri Jul 3 02:54:48 2015 UTC,Nevada is not that far.   Just don't think of it being the Lifestyle. It's hiring a hooker. Go where it's legal.
Swingers,3bwhi3,RichardMNixon42,3,Fri Jul 3 04:20:26 2015 UTC,It's a good foray. Find escort review sites. Look for an escort that takes couples.

Swingers,3bwhi3,Tool_Time_Tim,3,Fri Jul 3 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"If you want actual sexual contact, then it's prostitution and illegal. Go to a swingers club on a night that doesn't allow single men, I saw plenty of FFM going on when we did. Just find a girl by herself, introduce yourself, and flirt for a bit. If she's interested she'll join you. If not, repeat."

Sometimes,  you'll find that the locals use a specific site,  or maybe they have a closed Facebook group you can get in to.   We joined SLS cause everyone said that was the biggest best site. It is the most used, but it's a ghost town in our area. Once we found the site everyone here uses, it was much better.   We also got invited to a closed Facebook group later.   Unfortunately,  there isn't much else you n can do except maybe ask in the forums about parties, etc. But you'll probably v get crickets back.

Most of us met through SLS and through those contacts, got invited to parties. We have also hosted parties in our homes. Most of us are old enough that our kids have moved out. People in the group often bring in new couples they have met individually who they vouch for so there is a bit of new blood in the group that way.  Short story is that you have to make a core group of friends before people will open their home to complete strangers. It takes time to build relationships."

Swingers,3btd2i,wifeisn2girls2,3,Thu Jul 2 00:22:52 2015 UTC,"We are the same way.  I (husband) handles all the SLS pregame and after talking with my wife we set up a meeting.  After the meeting she is all for messaging on KIK with the other couple.   Before we had this arrangement she would lose countless hours to messaging people who only wanted to chat, or worse were just after pictures via text.  (I always assumed the chatters were obese guys living in their parents basement, who made a profile with stolen pictures...)"
Swingers,3btd2i,Pasture_Raised,3,Thu Jul 2 02:00:13 2015 UTC,"Conversely, we consider couples that insist on protracted online/text/email conversations to be a red flag. Swinging is done in person. Get to the meeting, then we'll see if we like talking to you."
Swingers,3btd2i,SwapFu,2,Thu Jul 2 11:46:44 2015 UTC,Yes! We've had people go on and on via text and then flake when it comes to actually meeting. I figure they might be single guys trying to get pictures.
Swingers,3btd2i,MatticusVP,2,Thu Jul 2 16:42:34 2015 UTC,"My wife doesn't like flirting with someone before she knows if she likes them in person. Rejection is harder after flirting. And lots of sexting is just plain stupid when you've never met. She's tried it, and it's not for her."

Swingers,3br0qe,throwitawayswing,4,Wed Jul 1 13:24:29 2015 UTC,Our problem is that we've had great success on SLS as paid members with 1 certification.  We're paid members on Kasidie and have been verified since February. We've never received a single message on Kasidie. No idea why.
Swingers,3br0qe,coffeeandtea_swing,3,Wed Jul 1 20:35:23 2015 UTC,"We would love to switch.  Unfortunately in our area EVERYONE is on SLS and NO ONE is on any of the other sites.  We created profiles on four other sites and while the closest person is not to far, the fifth closest is over 200 miles away.  I agree that the reading the display detail should flag the message as read.  Why provide the sender with any information at all regarding status of the message if this is the case.  For now it seems like we are stuck with SLS. Kasidie does seem so much better, I envy people who are in areas where Kasidie is well used.  It seems like an insurmountable task to get people to switch over in our area.  Hopefully something can get people thinking about it!"

Swingers,3br0qe,open1899,5,Wed Jul 1 13:37:29 2015 UTC,Kasidie grew into a powerhouse in a year. Quiver is dying on the vine the way I see it. The biggest problem with swingers is they all fragment... or not a problem at all if you can be happy in your fragment.

You can verify as a genuine couple on Quiver, I'm not aware of that on any other sites. We're on SDS, Kasidie, Swingtowns and SLS and I never noticed that feature.  Plus Quiver is still currently totally free. You just need to complete your profile for full functionality. All the other sites are paid for full functionality, AND they still suck.  Kasidie is the only one that is sorta modern but we like Quiver a lot more.   As for user base everyone talks about SLS like it has a shit ton of genuine couples. It has a shit ton of profiles and maybe 10% are for real. It's almost as bad as adult friend finder with the fakes and scammers."

Also, I'd like to address your comment that suggests we're making easy money and only in it for the money. 1) we haven't made a profit yet. The site is currently free. 2) we're not in it solely for the money. We are swingers too and created Quiver because we believe the community deserves better"

Swingers,3br0qe,jporkins,4,Wed Jul 1 22:16:51 2015 UTC,I can say fairly that /u/tbstexas isn't a potential user. He's been bashing Quiver every time I've seen a comment from him about swinger sites. Dismissing Quiver and insisting there's nothing wrong with SLS. Which is perfectly fine and up to him.

Swingers,3br0qe,Nice-Rapist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:09:01 2015 UTC,One for each user...
Swingers,3br0qe,Swingersbaby,4,Thu Jul 2 03:30:44 2015 UTC,"SLS should really hire a competent web designer.  Their new site looks slightly better, but its a poorly designed click fest.  For example if you want to click a couple as a friend or uninterested or whatever, you have to open their profile, click the button, wait for a redirect, click the ""back"" after it says its been updated.  That should just be an easy click you can even do from the search page."
Swingers,3br0qe,GibraltarEgo,4,Wed Jul 1 14:11:57 2015 UTC,"It's much more complicated than that. They need competent developers to rewrite the server side software that runs the site. I don't know how much $ SLS is worth, but it could easily cost them $300K to hire an outside firm to rewrite everything. At this point, they've got the user snowball effect working for them, so they have no motivation to change. But it's not impossible, look at MySpace."
Swingers,3br0qe,SwingSquared,2,Wed Jul 1 21:28:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, no. It wouldn't cost them a dime if they ran it as an actual professional business. There are consulting companies all around the world who would give their left arm to partner with a market dominant client like SLS in exchange for future profits. I worked for years at a consulting company that did this kind of thing. Clients had great ideas but questionable implementations. We's step in and rewrite the tech. Client pays nothing. We'd simply look at their current growth rates beforehand, and agree to take a percentage of the future growth increase.   As a real world example, one of the last clients I worked with had a quarterly growth rate of only about 3%, IIRC. After we reworked their software, their growth rate jumped to 21%. We took a third of the profits from the 18% increase for a year. The client got a 12% overall boost in growth profits without laying out a dime. For us, it was a seven figure contract by the time all was said and done.  The problem with SLS, and with many small tech companies, is that they're focused on the technology and not on the services. When you're providing services, technology is not a profit center. People don't pay extra for well written code. SLS would be better off handing the tech off to a competent partner and focus their attention on building their actual business."
Swingers,3br0qe,littlebobbythrowaway,0,Thu Jul 2 05:10:43 2015 UTC,You're absolutely right. It doesn't help that the site is written in ColdFusion.
Swingers,3br0qe,littlebobbythrowaway,0,Thu Jul 2 00:10:15 2015 UTC,"Their new site looks slightly better   Eh, I don't know about that. I make websites for a living, and frankly, I'd rather have the old site. I had hoped the new site wouldn't suck. I don't know why I bothered to get my hopes up."
Swingers,3br0qe,emmett419,2,Thu Jul 2 00:09:08 2015 UTC,"Quiver is growing 25%/MONTH, (based on a statement from quiver elsewhere in this discussion). It is probably safe to say that SLS is not growing at anything near that rate. At some point, SLSs lock-in, (in my opinion, their only advantage), is going to be negated. And then the fact that quiver is less buggy, looks better, works better, and responds better to customer feedback, is going to be decisive. Network effects being what they are, I can imagine the switch from SLS to quiver happening very rapidly, probably city by city.  I'm not a shill for quiver, I belong to both SLS and quiver, and in fact quiver hasn't ""worked"" for me yet. But I can read the writing on the wall."
Swingers,3br0qe,jporkins,2,Wed Jul 1 17:38:35 2015 UTC,"Not fair to compare growth rate of a small site versus a behemoth like SLS. Much easier to gain 25% growth when the base is smaller. So in SLS's defense, getting 25% growth on top of the user base they already have would be near impossible when they probably already have most of the fish in the sea signed up. Quiver is just hoping some of those fish also sign up with them.  It's like trying to siphon customers away from Wal-mart.  Fellow Quiver user and fan here, fwiw."
Swingers,3br0qe,emmett419,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:54:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree with you. My point is that with such growth, they have a chance of having the network effect work for them, unlike many other would-be SLS competitors. If they reach critical mass, then the fact that they are superior in so many other ways becomes relevant, and a potential problem for SLS.  Or to say it another way: SLS has critical mass, Quiver has technology. Quiver is threatening to achieve critical mass, at least in some areas. SLS has proven they are unable to master technology."
Swingers,3br0qe,mvcouple4fun,2,Thu Jul 2 21:19:48 2015 UTC,"We'd entertain the idea of leaving SLS but it seems like every other site out there cares first about how much money they can get from us and then about whether or not we successfully connect with another couple (if at all). The only reason we paid for an SLS membership was that as gimped as it was for free members, we still had a couple of successful dates from it."
Swingers,3br0qe,jetic16,2,Wed Jul 1 18:08:44 2015 UTC,"Age doesn't auto update on Kasidie either!! And Kasidie dumps all messages into one mailbox, no auto sorting from the hundreds of party invites vs. interested couples.  Every swinger site has issues."

The site has a nice forums section, the communities and parties features work well, and the desktop version of the site runs great on my phone too, which is a plus.    I haven't renewed our SLS paid subscription in a very long time for a lot of the reasons mentioned above."

I get nervous when YOUNG couples start talking about swinging before they totally know each other.  I wouldn't say swinging is a sport for older couples, but I would say swinging is a sport for mature couples, as in mature in their relationship.  My wife and I started in our late 20's but we had been together almost 10 years by that point.  I knew her totally and I'm not talking about sex but mentally too.    Even with this, the transition from vanilla to swinger had a few rocky parts, especially with my jealousy after the first full swap.  No drama but a lot of internal conflict, conflict that ended up being nothing, but would have probably been relationship fatal if we were still new to this."

How we usually handle things is:  I(the guy) contact the other couple, exchange photos/ send a few messages, if I get a good vibe I schedule a casual, no expectation date. We grab drinks after work, then my wife and I talk it over and decide if we want to schedule a second date which usually ends up in play time.   There is no rush, try to reach out to a few people and plan some dates, if you don't feel ""the chemistry"" don't do anything else, otherwise talk it over and schedule a play date at a later date.   Good luck!"

You can retreat to your own airconditoned ""domain"" any time you want to, dance/play into the wee hours and stumble naked a few steps to your own bed. We especially like waking up there in the morning - no day-pass people before 10:30 (?), very quiet with a few couples lounging around, some light breakfast to munch on, pretty much as close to ""romantic"" as you can get at a sex club."

Swingers,3boto5,mrs_naughty_mr_nice,6,Tue Jun 30 22:56:34 2015 UTC,"Lots of things can save a marriage. If a particular couple is just bored and they are starting to ""itch"" for some excitement, swinging can be a great way to fill that void. So can couples bowling, hiking, or tandem bicycle riding.   If a relationship has issues,  it's ignorant to believe that sex with other people will magically fix everything,  but if the issues are relating to sexual satisfaction,  intamcy, botedom, etc I can see how swinging might help.  My wife and I were getting bored of each other in the bedroom and we had almost stopped having sex altogether.  Cheating wasn't an issue but we both agree that with all things being equal it could have been in 3 to 5 years. Fix problems? No, but perhaps prevention against a very limited number of problems.  We communicate better now and we are both just a lot more fun to be around after being in the lifestyle."
Swingers,3boto5,counselor1234,4,Wed Jul 1 00:00:06 2015 UTC,Yes... The blanket advice is just mostly right. If you're a high school sweetheart couple that wants more notches on your bedpost swinging will literally save you from cheating with the person in the cubicle next to you at work.

Swingers,3boto5,the_real_t,2,Wed Jul 1 04:26:01 2015 UTC,"I think the statement should be reworded from ""swinging can save a marriage"" to ""swinging might save your marriage"".  The former makes it sound like swinging is actually a good strategy to adopt when your marriage has problems.  The latter implies there's an element of risk associated.  Sure, swinging might do a lot of good! It might increase your communication, it might re-ignite that thing you both need...it might be great! But, it also might be disastrous. It might turn every crack into a deep gash, and completely destroy it. As swingers/non-monogamists/poly/etc, our lives challenge everything that many societies claim marriage is supposed to be based on. There is absolutely no road map to navigate this lifestyle even when things are good in your marriage, and there's no benchmark by which people can adjust their behavior when things get hairy...so if the foundation of a marriage is broken, then what do they land on when they fall?  If there are ""cracks"", then is the risk worth the reward?? Maybe if you already feel you've nothing more to lose...but that's not a marriage anymore anyway. I tend to agree with u/counselor1234, take up something a little more innocuous...and then have an open conversation."

Swinging requires trust, communication, honesty, no jealousy.  At the end of the night, you should still want to go home with your spouse."
Swingers,3boto5,chickenman316,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:51:14 2015 UTC,"I think swinging can prevent cheating to some extent. It won't save or fix a marriage with issues.

Lots of marriages could have probably been saved if couples were more open to possibilities instead of clinging to the default rules of possessiveness."

This is just smoke and mirrors.  The ""real"" ""cracks"" in relationships that can't be solved by swinging or nonmonogamy have to do with a lack of trust and lack of good communication skills, or when the relationship is just O.V.E.R. and nobody wants to face it.  So they fuck other people thinking that the problem is about ""variety"" or ""adventure"" and then come to find out they went into it for all the wrong reasons.  But this is reddit, where people like to pretend to be edgy, so they say the opposite of ""conventional wisdom"" in a thinly-veiled attempt to sound as if they came up with some original thought of their very own."

That doesn't mean that swinging will save 100% of marriages, or even 5%, but it can save marriages.  In my case, my wife and I were on the verge of divorce in the early 90s.  We had financial issues, I was deployed constantly with the military, and eventually my wife cheated on me.  We turned to swinging as something to add adventure to our lives, and it remained a core component of our life until she passed away.  I also have a very close friend who often browses this subreddit and might chime in.  His marriage was on the rocks - he and his wife had actually separated and lived apart.  They gave swinging a try, and two years later, they've never been happier in their marriage, they've moved back in together, and they will tell everyone that swinging is what saved their marriage without any shadow of a doubt.  Some of the big things that can wreck a marriage are money, kids, trust issues, and boredom.  Swinging probably won't help with the first three, but if your marriage is boring, you don't have any shared hobbies, and you're just going through the motions, what better hobby to share together than something so sexual in nature?"

That's me he's referring to, and he's right.  We had separated, were planning on divorce, and gave swinging a try after a drunken text message conversation one night.  While our relationship issues had nothing to do with trust our lack of love, we were pretty poor at communicating.  Swinging taught us to communicate better, but most importantly gave us a joint interest.  Previously we had separate hobbies and interests - swinging was the first thing we found to do together that we both enjoyed.  It won't fix every marriage, but swinging fixed mine.  Two years later, we couldn't be happier together, and every issue we had in the past has been resolved.  If I'd listened to the ""conventional wisdom"" of the Reddit hivemind early on, I'd be divorced by now."

The bartenders (who i may be wrong but i think are also volunteer) do have a tip jar so if you use them show them some love.

Here's what I've done multiple times to deal with overly drunk guys.... I take it upon myself to make myself their best buddy for the next 15-30 minutes.  Talk to them about whatever their drunk ass is most interested in at the moment.  If they are mad about something - sympathize, tell em' how wronged they've been, and how YOU agree what they've been through is all bullshit.  If they are really interested in hitting on some chick, tell them how you know her and you can get them introduced in 'just a few minutes'.   If they are hungry - feed them or offer to bring them to a burger joint in 'just a few minutes'.  If they are unsteady, literally give them a shoulder to lean on.  Keep them close - within arms length or closer.  Basically - bullshit them and keep them physically safe and contained.  MEANWHILE - with your free arm and a cell phone - or with the help of another person - get the bouncers/cops/security/hosts/sober friends whatever.  Keep the drunk occupied, keep them from hurting themselves or others until the help arrives.  This has worked for me multiple times.  It's not fun.  It puts a damper on my evening but it's better than watching someone get hurt or seeing them hurt other people.  We are all in this together.  Let's watch out for each other.  LS or otherwise."

Swingers,3bj4tv,justcuriousaboutsex,11,Mon Jun 29 17:27:57 2015 UTC,"The Amish have a rite of passage called rumspringa, which is a set period of time during which their young adults are allowed to explore the outside world and live, dress and behave as we non-Amish folk do. When rumspringa ends, they must choose between making a lifetime commitment to returning to their home community to live a simple life or remaining in the outside world and making a go of it. Alone. Most choose to return to what they know.   Now what does that have to do with your situation?  Your concern, if I understand you correctly, is that you are on the precipice of entering into what will hopefully be a lifetime commitment without ever having, bluntly, slutted around. So, before making that commitment, your fiancé and yourself are interested in sowing some wild oats before saying your vows and forsaking all others.   Is that about right?  It's not necessarily a binary question -- be married and monogamous and always wonder, or don't. What if, for instance, you go through with this plan and, during the crush of wedding stress, one of you freaks out over what the other did with their pre-wedding hall pass? Or, worse, what if either of you can't live with what you did with that last fleeting moment of freedom...or didn't do?  As I noted above, there are other options. You are young, and have lots of time. If you are in love, and happy, and want to make a lifetime commitment without passing up your slut phase, you could say ""I do"" with a caveat.   Negotiate an agreement that after five or ten years of marital bliss, you will sit down and have a serious conversation about ethical nonmonogamy. Give yourselves time to grow into each other, to truly commit over the course of years, and develop the kind of trust and mutual reliance that only comes with the fullness of time.   And then go explore, hand in hand and with the utmost confidence that your beloved will always come home to you without a shred of doubt in their heart.   I may be wildly wrong, but that's the best I have for you."

So we didn't do exactly what you 2 are doing, but we're doing it now. No regrets. We love each other more than ever.   However, your situation worries me a bit. In my opinion, if you aren't sure you are ready, then you're not ready. I'm sure some will disagree with me, but I feel marriage is that 1 question you should absolutely be 100% sure of before going through with it. Be aware that swinging is not a fix or a test. It is extra spice to sprinkle onto something already awesome.  There's nothing wrong with swinging together as a dating couple. Put the marriage thoughts on the back burner and have fun together. Just be in a relationship and don't worry about labeling it."
Swingers,3bj4tv,coffeeandtea_swing,3,Mon Jun 29 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"My better half and I just had that conversation two nights ago...before we married, our older married relatives tried to sit us down and explain to us What Marriage Really Means. We were two 27-year-olds who had no idea what we were signing up for, and I don't know that anybody really does until they're living it."
Swingers,3bj4tv,notourrealnames,2,Mon Jun 29 20:05:49 2015 UTC,Great advice!
Swingers,3bj4tv,flwrsme,4,Mon Jun 29 20:15:03 2015 UTC,"We were actually really interested in the lifestyle because we've both never been with anyone before. We were each others' firsts. When we started dating and up until we got married, we were both good little kids, so we never got the chance to really fool around.  I think that even intensified our interest in swinging, and I would say it's one of the reasons why we're in the lifestyle, so that we can explore what being with other people is like and enjoy it together."
Swingers,3bj4tv,MidwestSwingers,3,Mon Jun 29 19:54:28 2015 UTC,"I can only talk about my own experiences.  My ex-wife was 17 and from a very strict religious background so she had zero experience before me.  Mine was the first cock she had ever seen, including porn, and everything about her was ""pure"" although she had a healthy and open minded sex drive once we were married,  After about a year, we had problems.  She was angry that I had fucked other girls in school while she had never been with another man.  So rather than lose the relationship (we were within minutes of separating), I told her that to be fair, she could fuck as many men as she wanted.  And she did.  Within six months she had fucked about 12 men.  Personally this is what I had wanted all along but she got really jealous when I fucked someone else, so we agreed to stay monogomous for  while.  However what she meant by monogamy is that I would not be with anyone else while she would just not tell me about all the men she was fucking.  Eventually we broke up, partly because of that and partly because after fucking all those men she decided she was gay. Exclusively.  Frankly, I would have loved to have had a heads up as to how she was before we were married,"

Swingers,3bjh30,Nice-Rapist,5,Mon Jun 29 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"strip bingo? because that would be more fun.   To offer a bit of different opinion, since our area has a smaller playing pool, everyone sort of knows who are the more ""active"" couples.   While we dont try to discriminate just based on high promiscuity, we try to stick with other couples who are a bit more selective and move at our pace.   Because we have different expectations we have not really engaged with these type of couples, which works out for us."
Swingers,3bjh30,CAhotwife84,2,Mon Jun 29 22:15:29 2015 UTC,Promiscuity isn't a key component. Everybody does this their own way.

Plenty, if not most swingers, have fewer partners. Plenty, if not most swingers, only engage with married people which is a statistically safer pool of sex partners.  My definition of promiscuity isn't sex outside of marriage. Marriage isn't relevant, nor is the presence of any relationship at all."

Being experienced isn't a bad thing, but if I feel that they a blaise and have become unconcerned with safety, then yeah, we might skip them.   One person said he was a male escort on the side... we passed.   In the end, you have to go with your gut. If someone doesn't make you feel comfortable (even if it's irrational), sometimes you just go with your gut and move on..  If people being extremely promiscuous makes you feel uneasy, go find someone more your speed.  This is your experience,  make it what you want."

Swingers,3bjh30,FeetInTheWater,2,Tue Jun 30 01:15:14 2015 UTC,"1) no we don't really care about the number of partners a couple has had or is currently seeing.   2) no  What has stopped us form seeing another couple is if we recognise differences in approach and style which signal different goals. We like more of a connection and enjoy getting to know people, regardless if playtime comes out of that. Some people are simply out to play (no judgement, everyone has their own thing) and we have noticed that these kind of ""booty call"" swingers tend to have racked up a lot of experiences. So number of previous or concurrent couples is more an indication to us that they might fall into that category, rather than being a knock out criteria for us."

The LS is definitely the place to go if you are looking for promiscuity but there is still room for those who aren't looking to play the field.  Some people want to live out their youthful fantasies and just fuck as many people as they can, some have self-worth issues, some want to just experiment, and some just want to have fun.  We take which of these a couple falls into for consideration.    Are we hypocrites?  Yes.  Yes we are."

Sometimes it comes up but I think it's kind of absurd to ask that sort of question in this context.   If somebody clearly has a lot of regular play partners the only challenge that presents is whether they're going to be able to make time for us and whether we'll measure up, so to speak.  But far and away the most important things are do we like them as people and are we attracted to them. If those are good (and we're picky) the rest is kind of trivial."

No. It's usually a random sampling and considering 2/3 of the population is overweight or obese . . . well . . .  Granted if you go to clubs that specify ""height weight proportionate"" you're more likely to find thinner and in shape people. But you might still find some on the chubby side. Generally HWP means ""no BBWs please"". BBW these days means obese."
Swingers,3bgnql,jollycooperation420,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"One thing that fascinates me about the lifestyle is that I believe it encourages participants to better themselves.  It's very easy for a couple to settle into a comfortable routine 10-15 years down the road after getting married, after having kids, well into their careers.  Sometimes they let themselves go a bit.  That may mean gaining weight, it may mean dressing less ""sharp"", it may mean loosening up on grooming, etc.  It's easy to do.  You may find yourself just not putting in the same level of effort you did back when you were first dating.  I think it's easy to slip into this mode.  Swinging can help you bring that back into focus and push you to take better care of yourself.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  Putting your best foot forward can't hurt.  It may even have positive spillover effects in your work life as well.  Who knows?"

I say this because clubs are all different.  We have one group here which I think the average woman has to be close to 300 pounds, and the organizer is a fat fetish guy, most will be broad spectrum of people, and some will be fit mostly.  None of the clubs/groups here discriminate based on size but like attracts like and they do tend to take on the flavor of the organizers in what they are looking for."

Swingers,3bepqa,wolfington12,2,Sun Jun 28 16:44:14 2015 UTC,"I hope so too - but remember, you're not responsible for his expectations.  First time out should be viewed as more of a ""getting the feel for it"" and less ""let's see how wet I can get my dick"" (not to put too fine a point on it)"
Swingers,3bepqa,throwfaraway1232,5,Sun Jun 28 16:50:50 2015 UTC,"Uhh...yeah...everything they said.  I don't believe this was addressed in the responses, but the reason you weren't approached probably is because the other couples sensed (or saw) the 'spats'.  No couple out looking for a good time is going to see another couple obviously not on the same page and go running toward them.  Some people can jump in to this lifestyle and go all out right from the start.  Some can't.  You and your husband are clearly in the second category.  There's no rush.  Feel it out.  Decide what you like/don't like.  What you both want/don't want.  But above all else, DON'T use your body to do something you think he wants to have happen.  You two - and everyone else - should be doing this if you're going to for one reason:  to make you both happy.  Finally, only a self-centered ass would look at your first time out, the experiences you had and the blowjob he got (!!!!) and say it was a waste.  Please get him straight before he ruins some nice lady's night after every sexual act he's hoping for doesn't actually happen.  That attitude is not needed."
Swingers,3bepqa,damnthetorps,2,Sun Jun 28 22:15:59 2015 UTC,probably is because the other couples sensed (or saw) the 'spats'.   I'd say definitely. Swingers see a couple arguing and they want no part of that. Not many people enjoy inviting drama into their lives.

Swingers,3bepqa,the_real_t,10,Sun Jun 28 19:35:30 2015 UTC,"First principles: sit down and talk to your husband. Get on the same page. Get on a footing where opening your marriage isn't transactional, some kind of reward for good behavior or a prize for tolerating bad behavior. It needs to be something the two of you do together as a couple, because the emotional and sexual rewards are mutually beneficial to your marriage. Otherwise, you're in for a bad time."

Swingers,3bepqa,rokuk,3,Sun Jun 28 20:43:46 2015 UTC,"I'd like to juxtapose our circumstance.   I (male) have always been very interested in swinging. It took me a long time to be honest about it with my gf of 6 years. Finally was, and she was very taken aback and upset.   Since then, I have let the idea percolate and now she is the one pursuing it. I have put her in the driver seat for if/when we do swing. I won't push her, and I let her make all the decisions about the if/when.   As a result, she has literally 180d and constantly sends me texts at work that she is in a tizzy (extremely horny).   Moving toward swinging has definitely made us better and closer, but your husband shouldn't push you. It will only lead to resentment."

Swingers,3ba2bd,cathbad09,7,Sat Jun 27 05:43:51 2015 UTC,"One of our very first swingers events was a private party in a loft, similar to what you're describing. We were also 23 (we're now later 20s) and it was a mind-blowing event that put aside all our fears and kicked off all the fun we had in the following years. Almost everyone at this party was young, and if they weren't, they still looked amazing. Everyone was totally normal and friendly. It started off feeling just like a normal cocktail party at someone's house. And truly, nobody cares if you don't want to participate, everyone is always very respectful.  That wasn't unique, almost all subsequent swingers clubs and events we went to were the same way. You don't need to worry about fitting in. Go with an open mind, check in with each other on how you're feeling, and do whatever you do or don't want to do. It will be an exciting and unique experience :)"
Swingers,3ba2bd,TilSwingdomCome,3,Sat Jun 27 13:00:38 2015 UTC,"We' ve never been to a large swinger event, mostly just clubs, so I can speak to much about what to expect but lifestyle events are generally, ""you get, what you put into it."" Im sure you'll have a great time simply wandering around, meeting others, sunbathing & cocktails, etc and have a great time; you might even get a little eye-candy or see something wild. My contradictory advice: 1) Stay within your comfort zone, ""check-in"" with each other periodically 2) Dont be afraid to break out of your comfort zone, explore something new; besides, you wont know if you like it, if you dont try it. Good Luck!"
Swingers,3ba2bd,SmellMyFingerMel,3,Sat Jun 27 07:41:09 2015 UTC,"It depends on your attitude toward older couples. We started out young, my wife was 22 and I was 26. When we went to events at first we got the nickname ""the kids."" We found couples that we were attracted to, age didn't matter, and we both prefer older people so it worked for us.  A takeover skews older because it is more expensive and requires more time. It's hard for younger swingers to go for money or family reasons.  We loved the takeovers (not Vegas so much but it's because we think Vegas is douchy) we went to and found people we matched with easily. Some younger, some older.  You don't really have to worry about fitting in if you're willing to adopt the routine of the takeover, each one has a flow to it. People won't just automatically approach you. Some will but you need to be assertive. One young couple at a takeover we were on complained that no one talked to them because of their tattoos to me once, I watched them the next day and they spent all afternoon hiding in the dead part of the pool not talking to anyone or participating in group huddle conversations... no wonder. You get out of it what you put in.  Unless you're repulsed by attractive people in their 30s and 40s you'll be fine so long as you are fine together."
Swingers,3ba2bd,tbstexas,2,Sat Jun 27 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"We were nervous our first time out too.  We decided to approach the night  to a club as a night out dancing without any expectations.  We had a great time.  A few couples introduced them selves,  we actually ended up being pretty good friends with them and eventually hooked up with one of the couples from that first night a while later.  We didn't hook up with anyone at the end of the night and that was fine because we had a lot of fun .  There's really no obligation to go off with anyone at an event or after.  If your nervous about the atmosphere,  just approach it as one of the sexiest dance parties you'll ever attend!"

I'd suggest making sure you have communicated exactly what your boundaries are. I'd also recommend NOT attempting seperate rooms for starters. If you can't stand the sight of your partner having sex with another person, then you're likely to not be ready for swinging.   In general, (and not necessarily in your case) 18 months is a very very short amount of time for a new couple to venture into swinging. It normally takes couples years to build up the requisite amount of trust and communication."

I recommend you listen to a few and see how they got involved in the lifestyle.  The ""logistics"" as you put it, are important.  It may be helpful to hear how others have navigated that point in their non-monogamous relationship.  You can always read ahead of the podcast episode synopsis and cherry pick the ones where the couple talks about their history.  That way you can focus on the subject that exactly pertains to your current interests."

We all get along as far as the other girlfriend and her new boyfriend. Everyone else is really excited to go and it's not like they needed convincing by him. I just don't see the point to it if we can stay home and get weird with ourselves already. Adding strangers does nothing for me.   My girlfriend and I have a very strong relationship and have gone out of our way for each other when exploring the lifestyle. I want to do this for her but I don't want to ruin the night if i get weirded out and am not having fun.

Swingers,3b3b53,flwrsme,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"I think the points below are right on.  But I will add, at least where I am located, in Southern CA, most of the clubs are set up where the bar/cocktail/dance area is separate from the play area.  So it could be just like going out to a bar and people watching.  Sure these people are probably more friendly than your average bar, but you get the point.  Then, say they want to go to the play area.  Ceritanly if your not feeling it at this point you could and should say no, but if you do, just be sure to let your girlfriend(s) and the other guy, that there will be absolutely No sex or touching with other people.  Then you could be having sex with your partners and watching the other people kinda like porn?  At one of the clubs here you could have sex in a room and the window looking in is only one sided, so you wouldn't be able to see people looking at you, but the excitement of people watching you could be a turn on....IDK.    And just to add.  If you really truly don't want to go, then you need to sit down and talk with your partners.  Explain to them how you are feeling and stick to your guns.  BUT, if you are willing to give it a shot, just know you wont be forced to do anything you don't want to do.    Best of luck to you.  I would be interested in a follow up if you do decide to go."

Currently the place needs some renovation and improvements. It is still a good club, but no longer one of the best. The club got sold a few years ago and the new owners have yet to improve anything. It is not easy to invest in renovation, since there is more internet dating and amazing parties that switch locations to compete with.   Club Life in Germany is newer and cleaner than Fun4Two.   There are many great parties where the organization rents an castle, small luxury hotel, smaller luxury cruise ship, mansion, cave or some other amazing place and turns it into a place for one night. If you like to party and swing. But these are generally more expensive than a club. At clubs price for a couple is generally 75 to 150 euro including food and drinks. While these parties charge 100 to 250 excluding food and drinks.   If you just want to hookup. Make an account on SDC.com and have a home or hotel date.  But in the summer Ibiza is the place to be!"

Swingers,3b1rwk,Rauven,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:32:27 2015 UTC,"We like Cap d'Agde partly because we to like to be nude and voyeur/exhibitionist. The clubs there are good and hugely inexpensive - eu20 per couple is typical - and usually well crowded.   And the place being a resort means you can live the event day and night for your entire visit - mess around at a club till the wee hours, stroll home for a little sleep, maybe a little personal play at wakeup to relive the highlights of last night, a little breakfast, stroll down to the 'adult' end of the beach to mess around a bit, grab some lunch and a little more r&r, repeat until it's sadly time to go home. Life is goood. (Remember public sex is illegal and vanilla folks and their kids stream by the shoreline where the adults are discretely performing adultery.)  For clubbing in Europe beyond Agde, we like Berlin very much. Clubs are more expensive but ubiquitous - where else can you find clubs that are open 24/7 for e.g. the nooner crowd.  Public sex is illegal; if you're not wearing at least a towel when you're doing it, you might be stuck with a small fine. It deserves its 'sex capital of Europe' description. Cheap to visit, too."

Swingers,3b1rwk,NWBoomer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:06:40 2015 UTC,"In cap d'agde Glamour and Le Jule are clubs with a dance floor, and  probably the best place to find the young/beautiful crowd. In Berlin, the techno/dance places (where sex in the odd corner is okay, but ""swinging"" doesn't go on) are where the beautiful people hang out. The guy at the door may not agree with your self-assessment, though; best to read one of those articles that describe the hot clubs and what you need to do to get in."

Swingers,3b00lc,Dont_throwItAway,9,Wed Jun 24 21:40:39 2015 UTC,"1 - Unicorns are THE most sought after thing in the lifestyle.  You have to be strong and able to communicate your wants and dislikes.  2 - I am on the heavier side (14/16) and have absolutely no problem finding men to play with in the LS. Girls my size and much bigger wear a variety of different things.  I wear dresses with thigh highs.  Skirts.  Cami's etc.  It just really depends on where you are going and the environment.  Low cut blouses or dresses are always something I wear (but I wear that all the time)  ;)   3 We (my husband and I) do not have an expendable income.  But yes it can be expensive.  We budget and is one of the reasons why we go to house parties more than the club.  House Parties are usually about half of the club cost.  BUT my dear unicorn, you wont have a problem because, single women are almost, if not always, free.  the clubs will require a membership, but once you pay that membership you will be able to go pretty much anywhere for free.   Yes, I think the LS sounds like a great thing for you to try out.  Like I said before, its really important, as a single girl, to find your voice and use it.  Be sure to know your boundaries regarding all aspects of the night.  You know if you go there alone, be sure to not drink too much.  Be sure you can drive home safely and be coherent at all times.  Once you get in and developed a good group of friends, you will be able to find rides.  LOL   Have fun and welcome!  =)   ETA: not sure why it keeps turning my last point into a 1. but it should be 4.  ;)"
Swingers,3b00lc,flwrsme,4,Wed Jun 24 21:50:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the reply! :) I really appreciate the advice. Generally, I'm more timid when first meeting people. Learning to be firm on something seems it will go a long way! :)"

Swingers,3b00lc,MamaXerxes,3,Thu Jun 25 01:43:13 2015 UTC,"Unrelated to this thread, but I am also a larger gal who is interested in the lifestyle (haven't called the club yet...).   I've always felt like the ugly friend, even though my husband disagrees. I mean, I'm not obese and have good skin and teeth, but never been model material. Do less attractive women do less well in the lifestyle, or is a pretty much even playing field?"
Swingers,3b00lc,NotReallyBi,3,Thu Jun 25 08:09:03 2015 UTC,"Most people play within there level.  If you're fat/obese and approach a healthy/fit couple be prepared for rejection as they most likely will not want to fuck you.  Some clubs cater to the overweight, some to interracial, some to over 50, and some to fit/HWP folks; but most cater to everyone so you get to see a little of everyone."
Swingers,3b00lc,flwrsme,3,Thu Jun 25 08:37:15 2015 UTC,"Ive seen single men who will play with less than attractive women.  As a couple, my husband has played with a few, but they made up for it in other ways, like really big ass or boobs.  I have never been rejected from any party (Ive been to over 30 different ones).  Clubs out in my area do not reject people for looks.  And I have not heard of this happening.  There is always someone for everyone.    ETA:  Im in Southern California"

Swingers,3b00lc,usewhippedcream,3,Wed Jun 24 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"1) What are your experiences with the ""unicorn""?   Most are fun. Some want things in exchange-buy me dinner, pay my rent. lol  How are they generally perceived in the lifestyle?  As sought after and any attention from one is good. Not sure it is tho when they want rent.  2) I think that this could be a huge push to start exercising again. I'm on the heavy side, could stand to lose a good 50 lb. I'm not that self conscious about my weight, definitely not enough to hinder a good time. I don't know how this will affect my experience at the club. What are your experiences with that? Also, what does someone overweight usually wear?  There are some parties that don't want BBW and others that seek them. Do what you want as far as exercising and diet.   3) I've noticed a lot of people involved in the lifestyle are ""well off"" and have lots of seemingly expendable income. I'm from a middle class home and don't pretend to be what I'm not. Wondering how well I'd fit into the parties. What are your opinions on it? hahahaha.....we know poor folks and rich folks and are very middle ourselves. We just don't manage to go to Hedo or Desire. You will be fine being middle class.  4) Do you think the lifestyle sounds right for me & anything else I should know? Only way to know is to at least go to a party. You can go and not play and just talk with folks so remember, no pressure to play and enjoy meeting new people.  EDIT: More importantly, any crucial tips for a first time unicorn?  Do NOT get drunk when you are alone at a party. You need to be able to keep yourself safe and that includes not driving drunk.   Once you know a few people you can ask them to drive you if you wanna play drunk :)"
Swingers,3b00lc,MatticusVP,3,Thu Jun 25 13:07:45 2015 UTC,"1) They seem to be highly sought after in the lifestyle. We've played with a couple and had a good time.  2) It is a good motivator to stay in shape. I could stand to lose a good 10 lbs myself and I try and stay healthy. Im working on that. As far as you being a little overweight, you'll be fine, Im sure. Working to improve yourself is always a good thing, and people will pick up on that. And there are always guys out there into bigger girls.  3) My girlfriend and I are certainly not well off. We dont have much expendable income. We dont really go to the lifestyle clubs in our area as they can be a bit expensive for casual use and tend to favor lower cost or free methods of finding other couples. We've been to a few smaller parties and fit in fine. And then we put some money away to make trips and turn those into swinging vacations.   4) From your post, yeah, swinging seems to be what youre looking for. Only way to tell if you'll like it is to experience it."
Swingers,3b00lc,NWBoomer,2,Thu Jun 25 16:50:47 2015 UTC,"Your chances as a single female are excellent, you will be highly sought after. Don't worry about it, you attitude and personality is what your success will be based on. Swingers don't look like porn stars.  Yes generally middle class, enough disposable income to afford travel to clubs, motels, meals, etc. That said, we know several couples who pay the way for their single female friends to participate.  If you are open minded, realize that any couples you play with are going to be committed to one another, keep it light and casual and you will have a good time. My wife found swinging extremely empowering for women to safely express their sexuality.   Go forth and enjoy."

Swingers,3az7i4,johnsmithwell88,11,Wed Jun 24 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"First off make sure you validate your wife's feelings. Tell her you're sorry she feels the way she does and that you are open to doing whatever is necessary to help her feel both valued and safe.  Next, I would suggest creating an online profile and in it say you're soft swap, girl-girl only. Discuss this with your wife first. Explain to her what that means -- only the girls play, the husbands watch or play with their spouse only.  Do that for a while. If you find a couple you click with, tell them your past experience and preferences. Tell them up front. If that doesn't work for them, let them go. There are other couples out there."
Swingers,3az7i4,SwapFu,5,Wed Jun 24 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"Excellent advice, as is typical of /u/SwapFu."
Swingers,3az7i4,STL-MO-CPL,3,Wed Jun 24 22:03:59 2015 UTC,"She is quite upset about the whole thing and doesn't want to think or talk about it.   I hope this sentence was supposed to end with a ""right now"", because eventually (sooner rather than later, I hope) she needs to talk about it and process it...with you.  I'm wondering if the scenario of her with another dude was discussed thoroughly enough between you two before you started this? Did she role play it in her mind before your playtime? Did she ask herself how she thought she'd respond if she hated any aspect of it?  I agree with the other responses.  Pull back from playing a bit, let her talk a lot, acknowledge her feelings as valid, but also show her that they don't have to be absolute. Have her read the great anecdotal resources found here and on the Swingersboard.    The more time you spend here invested in learning about this life, the more you normalize a lot of the counter-intuitive feelings you're having...remember, we come from a ""monogamy is the only path to success"" society, and deprogramming that is sometimes a pretty painful experience."
Swingers,3az7i4,quanchompy,2,Wed Jun 24 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"There are some really great online resources.  In addition to sites like Swingersboard, there are also a dozen or so fantastic podcasts that have some excellent content as well."
Swingers,3az7i4,STL-MO-CPL,3,Wed Jun 24 22:03:07 2015 UTC,Did she perhaps take one for the team in order to satisfy her craving for girl-girl? You may wish to discuss that possibility with her. It's not uncommon to struggle a bit with this as it seems there are way more sexy girls than guys in LS couples.
Swingers,3az7i4,Audentes_fortuna_juv,2,Thu Jun 25 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is possible. At a party once, I had a great time but I felt nasty afterwards and realized it was because I lowered my standards and gave a very unattractive man oral so I could have that same opportunity with his gorgeous gorgeous young girlfriend. She was amazing. He was almost scary old and had some facial scarring. I decided not to do this ever again. And let me add that I never take one for the team for my husband, only did it that once for personal reasons. I would never expect him to do it for me either."
Swingers,3az7i4,jeze_,6,Thu Jun 25 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"So from what you've described it sounds like she's more upset about being with the other man, but not the woman.  If that's the case, then you might have to look at restricting your open activities to only MFF encounters."
Swingers,3az7i4,enoughwiththebread,2,Wed Jun 24 19:31:24 2015 UTC,It really is all about her comfort. Perhaps she wasn't comfortable with strangers..or at least THESE people. Non judgmental Communication is key
Swingers,3az7i4,romikk32,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:42:15 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the party. My wife literally cried the first few times we swapped and she felt like she did something wrong after for like 5 years. She never called herself a ""swinger"" until the morning she woke up and didn't have any guilt... though I'm not telling you those feelings are gone now, just that they are more understood by her.  Her feelings are textbook, what she does from now on depends on how she wants to proceed and how well you guys work through it. If she likes girls that won't go away.  I think my wife is totally fine with the women she is interested in and totally fine with the men she really knows and likes... not at all fine with strangers who are too rough that she isn't 100% interested in. I think your wife was put off by the guy and it was probably due to not knowing him well enough. The girl/girl lust is stronger than her lust for other dudes. Roll with it.  /u/SwapFu is dead on and we've been swinging happily for a decade by adjusting how we roll.  Recommend focusing on the girl/girl part of it. There are plenty of couples where that is the focus. Do soft swap or full swap at her pace, this might mean really knowing a couple first. Generally the rules get relaxed big time when the spark is really there and not forced. For example, we're soft swap but we have some close friends where the rules don't at all apply, this is because years of trust and rapport were built up.  Nothing good is easy. Talk it through and adjust to what she, if you're anything like me, it's all good."
Swingers,3az7i4,tbstexas,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:38:07 2015 UTC,"As others have said, validate her feelings. This is normal stuff. My wife and I have been in the lifestyle for 7 years, we are about an easy going as it comes, but I sometimes get weird feelings I get this ""swinger guilt"", that I feel like what I'm doing is wrong even though rationally I'm fine with it and I grew up in a sexually liberal environment, but I have these occasional weird panging moments of ""this is wrong,  I feel like this is wrong."" But I go with it because 98% of the time I'm loving it. Long story short, mixed feelings are normal and you either decide that it's worth it to keep going or you decide that it's too much to handle."

I haven't looked at the forecast recently - we just got back from a trip yesterday afternoon - but if it's decent weather you'll spend some time in the Back 40 until the 6PM people leave. But I can't disagree with the 'nice fun weekend' part. Even behind that palm tree, we've had fun.

The solution in our experience is to make plans to meet people there that you already are excited to have some fun with.   Since your intention was to meet them they won't be shy about coming up and saying hi or vice versa.   This has made our trips to clubs much more successful and fun."

For a game that is so unfair, stylistically inconsistent, and frustrating, it has been tremendously influential.  This was the first of its kind -- using words to create a rich simulated world.  Nobody had seen anything like it; it spread quickly across the Internet.      In early 1977, Adventure swept the ARPAnet. Willie Crowther was the original author, but Don Woods greatly expanded the game and unleashed it on an unsuspecting network. When Adventure arrived at MIT, the reaction was typical: after everybody spent a lot of time doing nothing but solving the game (it's estimated that Adventure set the entire computer industry back two weeks), the true lunatics began to think about how they could do it better [proceeding to write Zork] (Tim Anderson, ""The History of Zork -- First in a Series"" New Zork Times; Winter 1985)   on this page: Comment | Transcripts | Interaction | References Comment  Note: Sources vary on the date of Crowther's original version, placing it anywhere from 1968 to 1977. In response to an e-mail query, Crowther put it at 1975, ""give or take a year."" Other evidence dates the composition to the 1975-76 school year, with Crowther probably abandoning the project in early 1976 (See ""Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original 'Adventure' in Code and in Kentucky."" Digital Humanities Quarterly 1.2 (2007)).   [play Colossal Cave Adventure online]  Some sources date the origin of Colossal Cave to 1972, on the grounds that Crowther was at that time keeping a computer map of the real Mammoth Cave.  While Woods is sometimes credited for turning Crowther's map into a game, Crowther's original definitely had treasures and puzzles.  In an e-mail to me, Crowther noted that he originally intended for the magical elements to be buried deep within the cave, but that Woods introduced the magic much earlier.

Swingers,3avi2m,NotReallyBi,5,Wed Jun 24 00:25:33 2015 UTC,I guess I am curious about why you would want to ask such clinical questions in what is supposed to be a sexy and fun environment?

Letdowns have happened to us in the size department before so if she is a size queen best to get it out of the way in a non-rude, non pushy, flirty sexy way b asking the question or making a statement about her preference."

Swingers,3avi2m,TouchMyPlants,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:44:07 2015 UTC,Breast size though? And from the way OP put it it was like he wanted to break out the measuring tape.
Swingers,3avi2m,Nice-Rapist,0,Wed Jun 24 13:46:43 2015 UTC,If my phrasing is sub par I apologize. I think your right though in that this would mostly be about the man parts that are hidden away. That being said I have experienced a let down before when a girl took off her bra and revealed she was using those chicken fillet size boosters to drastically misrepresent her breast size.
Swingers,3avi2m,NWBoomer,2,Thu Jun 25 00:59:33 2015 UTC,"I love how people are acting like size doesn't matter to some people and not being the right proportions will always end happily and without embarrassment when concealed until the last moment.   While it may not be your cup of tea, a bit too common and gauche for the swinging elitist, it obviously matters to some or it wouldn't even be a topic of conversation or a question in the minds of some. Since it does matter, mostly to the ""size queens"" as someone so elegantly put it, why is it an issue to bring it up? You don't have any issues putting the brakes on for other sexual no-goes or request favorable acts to be performed specifically, why not ask about breast and penis size? Personally, I think the only people that it will offend are those that feel they leave something to be desired in the size department. I have an average size cock. It won't cut the grade with the ""size queens"". It wouldn't offend me a bit if a lady told me I'm just not big enough for her. I would happily go and find a lady that doesn't have a huge, wore out pussy and not think another thing of it."

Swingers,3ax4ui,savguy6,3,Wed Jun 24 05:20:33 2015 UTC,"Can't add a comment to the official discussion, so I'm adding my story here.  A few weeks before getting married: My then-fiance asks if getting married means that we have to be monogamous. I struggle with that too, but having cultural baggage, and wanting to give the marriage a good chance of working, I say that I want us to be monomgamous.  We get married.  Next 24 years: We have our jobs. My wife wants to stop working and raise a family so we do that. I spend extremely long hours on my career. We are on auto-pilot in all ways. Sex is somewhat frequent, and satisfying, but not stellar for either one of us. Friends cheat and stay together for the kids, cheat and break up, divorce for other reasons. We stay together and count ourselves lucky.  November 2012: One kid is in college, one is in high school. My career has been successful, and I'm about to retire. We're happy with each other but bored and restless. Our town is full of clones that we don't like. Through a meetup, we find ourselves at a nice bar with two other couples. We all click and head back to our new friends' house nearby to continue the party. There is music, dancing, booze, pot, and while there is no sexual tension, it is a very sexy evening.  My wife makes a joke about this turning into a key party. But clothes stay on, and we agree to stay in touch. My wife and I can't stop thinking about this party.  February 2013: I retire. The free time is wonderful, and in some ways that does great things for our sex life, but we are also still getting bored. One of the couples of our new group of friends splits up. We find out that they tried swinging as a last ditch effort to save their marriage. I hear about their visit to a swing club, and I can't stop thinking about that. (We recently found out that the third couple had been swingers.)  Spring and summer 2013: My wife keeps hearing about friends who cheat. But this time, she's jealous of them. Not for the heartache and anxiety it causes, but for the fun. It's exciting to be with someone new, and do new things. She tells me this and I think the same.  October 2013: I decide to ask my wife if she wants to try swinging. I'm really not sure if this is going to break her heart or she'll be enthusiastic about it, or somewhere in the middle. I think the worst outcome is unlikely, so I decide to do it. Also, I join SLS with a tame couple's profile, to look around.  November 2013: I ask. She says YES. Immediately. We start talking about pros and cons, what we want out of swinging, what our ground rules are. We meet a couple from SLS just to talk and ask questions. We had a soft swap encounter with another couple, which we loved. We have gone on from there, and have been swinging since them -- house parties, clubs, some long-term friends, some one-night friends. It's been wonderful for our sex life and for our relationship. Wish we had started years before."

When she was ready to move back to Milwaukee she wanted to date me again. I was seeing someone and wasn't really sure which direction to go and if I should entertain getting back together.  So I told her about my past as a single male and that I ""dated"" a couple and some of my exploits. I sort of did it to shock her, like do you really know me and want to date me? She thought it was hot and told me about liking girls and trying to get her last bf to have a 3 some with a bartender but him not thinking she was serious.  So here we are, the needs variety guy and the girl who likes girls. Married for 7 years, swinging for 9."
Swingers,3ax4ui,tbstexas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:52:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Not totally sure who brought it up first.  Our relationship has been a bit unconventional from the get-go. It just seemed like a natural fit for us to discuss it. She had been involved with me in some MFF action before we were together; we are both very sexual people, and it kind of became a topic of conversation.   Once we found ourselves talking about it, we quickly progressed to talking about it (and other sex related stuff) a lot. We're super open with each about sexual matters, realized we were both into the full-swap swinging idea, and it has progressed from there. We routinely talk about what we'd each like to try, what our potential hangups might be, what we each want from the experience, and how we can share the experiences/use them to bring us closer.  Granted we haven't yet actually played with another couple, but that's been more a matter of circumstance than anything else, and is likely to change reasonably soon.  If you have any other questions we'd be happy to share our answers :)"

Swingers,3arzh0,MamaXerxes,9,Tue Jun 23 01:06:28 2015 UTC,"Hey!  Congrats on looking into swinging and good luck!  I always like to link to this topic from /r/sex.  The comic oh joy sex toy also did a good primer on non-monogamous sex!   The cliffnotes are: You are not ready for a threesome, open relationship, swinging, etc. if:   You experience visceral feelings of hurt, jealousy, or insecurity thinking about your partner playing with someone else. You can’t discuss your wants, needs, and sexual desires openly and honestly. You are having problems in your primary relationship with trust, communication, or compatibility. You want to use swinging to “fix” your relationship. You aren’t really interested in your partner so you are using the excuse of swinging to get a chance to fuck another person (if this is the case, you probably need to reconsider your relationship altogether).      I hope you don't mind that wall of text as a preface to answers to your questions.     How old where you when you started swinging?    He was 25, she was 22.   How did you know it was the right time?    We were comfortable with each other and our relationship, communicated well, and both wanted to explore sexual nonmonogamy.     How did others in the lifestyle react to you?    Of course there was a lot of comment on our age (we're very young for swingers).  Generally, we've felt very welcome.  Some people on this subreddit have had lots of bad experiences with younger people, however, so we've had to deal with some negative opinions of younger people trying swinging here.  Before we played with anybody else, we were the only people either of us had had sex with.  That weirded some people out, but ultimately was pretty inconsequential.  We have just communicated well with the couples we've played with and nothing has gone horribly wrong yet.   What are things you learned that you didn't know before you started?   Swingers are a cross-section of the general population.  Aside from having non-monogamous sex, don't expect them to be any different than the population at large.  This can be good and bad."
Swingers,3arzh0,DoubleEntendre_,2,Tue Jun 23 02:19:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  Yeah, after doing a bit more reading in the sub, it's interesting to see how they tend to reflect the views of the population in general when it comes to LGBT issues. As an ""actual"" bisexual (by that I mean, not just ""bi-curious"" to make swinging easier), I'm worried that I'll run into a lady who isn't really bi and feel terrible about playing with her when she isn't actually into me.   It's also a little disappointing because I think guy on guy is INCREDIBLY hot, and I'm a little bummed I'll probably never get to see that."
Swingers,3arzh0,DoubleEntendre_,2,Wed Jun 24 07:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the bisexuality issue is frustrating.  I wouldn't give up hope of seeing male/male however.  Our culture is evolving, and as LGBT becomes more acceptable, I expect to see more accepting attitudes among swingers as well."
Swingers,3arzh0,IsThatYourElbow,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:24:32 2015 UTC,"Long time lurker here/young couple (27/27)who are looking to dip ours toes. Take my opinion with a grain of salt.  Funny you say that, on The Curious Couples podcast that mentioned that once when referring to clubs that don't allow single men, would they or should they let in gay male couples. He said he couldn't see clubs allowing it because if he was a single guy, he would just find a buddy to walk in holding hands with then separate once in side. I mean the clubs would prob notice right away and kick douchebags out that did that.   On the other hand, I wonder if a club would accept a lesbian couple as a couple or as two single ladies. I mean who knows what they are really there for, if it's just girls to play with would they make issues with men who feel uncomfortable? Fuck no. At that point im sure all the club cares about is which is a better door cover two girls or a couple.   IMO, I wouldn't care if LBGT where in this lifestyle, and I phrase is like that because we haven't even been to a club or gone further then research on here/podcasts/swing sites.  So when we do eventually go to an event/club/party(which we are planing next month while out of town)it wouldn't bother me to see two guys going at it. I have the mindset of sex is sex, just because it's a style I don't do/haven't tried/not interested in/ect doesn't mean I should not accept it. I go about this attitude in my everyday life, I don't care about people's lifestyle, I care about mine.  Sorry for the ""rant"". Idk. Just woke up. It sparked an interesting question in my head. Human sexuality/anthropology/sociology fascinate me as well as personal interest."

Swingers,3arzh0,happycouple247,3,Sun Jun 28 23:44:07 2015 UTC,"How old? We were in our late 30s and had been married for over 10 years.   How did we know it was time? We went to our first hotel party when we both agreed to it with no pressure from the other.   How did people react? A vast majority of the people in the lifestyle are really friendly!  What did we learn? You can make your rules as open as you want. We started off VERY slowly. We were going to just have sex in the same room as other people. We wanted to watch and be watched. It was lots of fun and that's mostly what we did that first party. We loosened the rules a little for the next one. And we loosened the rules a little more by the time we got to our first swing club. We talk about it a lot! We communicate in the moment and we go over what happened during the play we just experienced to review what we liked and what we would like to try next.  It sounds like you two have the communication thing down cold so that's a GREAT help.  Put a toe in the pool and splash around a little. Work your way up to major stuff and this is for FUN! If you're not having fun then you may need to back away.  I hope this helps.  And like I just said, have fun!!"
Swingers,3arzh0,pervyduo,2,Tue Jun 23 14:59:32 2015 UTC,"Age is irrelevant, as long as you're legally capable of sexual consent in your jurisdiction. Trust, Communication & being able to handle the occasional feelings of jealousy through calm expression with your partner instead of anger are the key factors.  Swinging is a ""learn as you go"" activity. You don't have to know all the answers up front, but you do need to have the ability to communicate your wants and needs with your partner both before and after an experience. You'll find that those wants and needs will be fluid, changing over time. If you're worried about moving too fast and finding yourselves in over your head, then start out slow... find a party to attend, and limit yourself to flirting in front of each other (for example)... if that excites you both, discuss and increase the boundaries as you see fit. As long as you communicate and agree upon every modification to your ""rules"", including those times when you try something and decide it was a little too far, then everything should be fine."
Swingers,3arzh0,pervyduo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:40:57 2015 UTC,"Seeing swinging described as ""learning as you go"" makes me a tad nervous, because I am pretty type A and like to have a plan for everything.

Swingers,3arzh0,okfornothing,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:30:51 2015 UTC,"It's really only ""learn as you go"" because our attitudes and desires change over time. Humans are an ever evolving creature; the more you experience, the more you expand.  As much as you'd like to plan for ""everything"", the reality is that there will be one or more other people involved beyond you and your partner. They will bring ideas and concepts to the table that you may have never thought of before. Some will interest you, some will not. The key is to know & enforce your boundaries, and re-evaluate with your partner in private AFTER each play date. Never try and change the rules in the heat of the moment. :)"
Swingers,3arzh0,NWBoomer,2,Thu Jun 25 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"I think being mature enough has a lot to do with the quality of your relationship in general. If you are both happy and both of you make each other happy, that is a great start. Understanding what swinging is and what is isn't is very important as well. Being able to share yourself and your s/o with others is not easy but obviously not impossible. Being able to share fantasies and sexuality together is important in most relationships and the more we are able to do that, whether we choose to be swingers or not, the better our relationships would be.   We started at ages 40 and 34. The time is ""right"" when both of you agree to do it and when you can make it happen. Only the two people involved in the relationship can determine when each of you is ready and when the relationship is ready. For us, I think most of the people we have met enjoyed our company. Not ever encounter is spectacular but you learn from that. Before you start, you should talk about your limits, talk about what you want to happen and what you don't want to happen. Also talk about No mean No and make sure that your play partners understand your limitations, respect you, your SO and your relationship. As you proceed into the lifestyle, you will start to see what you like and what you don't like. What you are looking for in playmates, etc."

Swingers,3arzh0,NWBoomer,2,Wed Jun 24 07:33:10 2015 UTC,"I admire that you state that you have very open and clear communication skills and that you ""don't know what you don't know"". That show a level of consciousness that some ""mature"" people I know still lack.   how old where you when you started swinging?   We were in our early 50's when we started; been into swinging for over a decade now.    How did you know it was the right time?   Although we had a great sex life as a couple, it was starting to get a bit ""predictable"". I did some research and brought it up to the wife. She then did her research and read up on it. We visited a club, she liked that aspect that women were in control. We talked about waiting until we were retired (concern about our careers were we somehow outed) but looking back now we wished we had started sooner.   What are things you learned that you didn't know before you started?    This really solidified our bond as committed partners; the very fact that we could engage in such an activity without being affected by trust issues or jealousy was empowering to us both. I think we knew that going in but the experience really brought it home to us."

Swingers,3asaqn,NotReallyBi,2,Tue Jun 23 03:43:42 2015 UTC,"As a newbie, give the other couple the chance to lead the conversation. Make the first move, say hello, flirt, let them know you are there for the first time, and ask open ended questions that give them a chance to talk about themselves. Don't monopolize one couple's time - move from couple to couple and stay with the same script. Keep it simple on your end.   Ask others to dance or play pool - or accept when they ask you to. Flirt more once the ice is broken if you have some chemistry with them."

How did you get into swinging?  Who brought it up first?  Would you like to join us for a drink?  We are going to play room to watch a little bit. Care to come with us?  Would you like to dance?  Conversation about hobbies is also acceptable.   They are normal people who just so happen to have sex with or in front of other people.  Just be friendly. Don't be creepy

Swingers,3ar15k,Swingforhim0921,11,Mon Jun 22 20:29:32 2015 UTC,I'm going to be very honest. I don't think this will end well for you. I'd suggest seeing a couples counselor if you want to keep your marriage before going to a swingers club. I'd say you're an adult and not boring. You need to work on your relationship considering you're both so young and not set up either a pattern of just doing what you can to please him or facilitating a high likelihood of actual cheating and then leaving. I would really really really not suggest going to a swingers club. It would more than likely doom any healthy relationship for you since you'd be doing it for the wrong reasons. I've seen couples go down this road of doing it for their partner while being meh about it and it never ever turns out well. If he's bored with you then you should do something you'd both enjoy and not take one for the team. Usually in situations like this the guy will either break the rules and cheat and cheat and cheat or divorce will follow because the other person prefers the ls to their SO. If you're wanting to spice up your relationship at this early in your life and marriage then you really need to see a therapist or just divorce. This is coming from someone who took one for the team for a miserable 3 years and still ended up divorced. For the love of God do not take the meh leap into swinging

That is not a marriage.  You will probably lose him anyway if you start swinging for this reason. If he resents you for not degrading yourself then fuck him. There are 7 billion people in this world.

Swingers,3ar15k,DoubleEntendre_,14,Mon Jun 22 23:19:18 2015 UTC,"This is why we are wary of couples in their 20s, or anyone in their 20s. No offense to you, but your twenties are a time when you are laying the groundwork for your future life, and frankly yeah, it's a lot of work and not much play.  He shouldn't push you into anything if you're already overwhelmed.  Also emotionally a lot of 20 somethings are just not where they need to be when it comes to swinging. It's a lot to process and young people get scared. At that age you kind of have a set of rules that have been handed down to you by society and the prospect of making your own rules as you go is overwhelming.  For the record we are not categorically opposed to 20 somethings. We like them, we just don't want drama.   ""No tongue kissing"". See, that to me sounds silly, and if we heard that we'd probably just pass.  We see this all the time at clubs with younger couples (sometimes even early 30s). Soft swap only, and then they want to chat with you for hours before they make a final decision. Same room no touching. No kissing, oral with protection only, etc. It feels so transactional and dull and our fear is that the slightest misstep is going to cause serious problems, it's just not worth it.  Go to a club, promise each other you won't do anything but talk to other swingers with experience, and perhaps watch other people and play with each other only.   Honestly before even going to a club I recommend having some long conversations where you beat non monogamy like a dead horse. Role play all the fantasies you have with other people . . . ad nauseum. Him watching you. You watching him. You taking two men at once, he taking two women, sex in public, all that, to see what gets you off, and to tear down any barriers of fear and guilt either of you might have about wanting to try things.   Take the mojo upgrade quiz while you are at it to get a good sense of where you're both at sexually.  Maybe try going to a strip club before a swinger club to get used to seeing him get attention from women. Share a lapdance. That sort of thing.  Take baby steps. I know he's bored but you have all the time in the world. Swinging will still be here next year and the year after that and 20 years from now."

Swingers,3ar15k,GodlessGamer13,3,Tue Jun 23 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"Before you get into swinging, you really need to know more about it and the truth about the risks involved. You need to have a very open communication level and both need an attitude that you are genuinely concerned that your SO is going to enjoy themselves. I am sure that he THINKS he is going to enjoy himself and that you honestly don't think that you will, but you both could be completely surprised how it can go the other way. HE very well could end up sulking in the corner while YOU are getting all the attention. And believe me, couples are going to sniff out the fact that you are only doing this FOR him and not because you want to do it.  As far as oral without protection, you will most likely have no takers, or very rare ones, in the LS. Nearly everyone understands that the risk of STDs from oral is so small that it is not worth the lack of sensation to use protection on oral. The worst STDs are going to be caught even with protection just from skin contact. If you want to be guaranteed of not getting an STD, you need to stay completely monogamous - both of you.  Please before you jump into this and have your marriage implode, take the time to research it and talk about it together. Then research it some more and talk about it again and again. Be totally on the same page with each other. Just talking about it together and looking into it CAN jump start the intimacy in your relationship with each other. There is enough built in emotional tension and possible drama in couples that ARE prepared for this - you really don't want to be ignorant of what to expect when you do it.   TALK to your husband about this. Hell bring him here and have him read this and other threads about first timers and beginners. Hopefully he will come to understand that it is more than all about him."

Let him know you need to feel safe (etc.), that you want to work up to it so it's enjoyable for both of you, etc.   I'd also seek out a swing/poly/king-positive therapist to help guide and counsel you through the process of opening up or at least relaxing the strict monogamy you're both accustomed to."

But you are mistaken. This is NOT what you want.  One possible outcome is that you will not find another couple to ""play"" with. Your discomfort is going to be clearly visible, and people will avoid you. Another possible outcome is that, to avoid this, you roam separately for the evening. This is even worse. You will have MANY interested guys, (which you clearly don't want), and he will probably have no interested women or couples.  Or suppose that you find another couple that is desperate or clueless enough to go through with it. What then? You will be happy that your husband got what he wanted. Nothing has changed otherwise -- you will still be working crazy hours and he will be bored until the next time you consent to endure another visit to the swingers club. He will probably start wanting to go more frequently. It may well become the cornerstone of your sex life. (His, anyway).  I think you need to tell him that you proposed swinging out of desperation, that you are only doing it for him, you don't want to do it otherwise -- basically everything you told us strangers -- and start working on the problems in your relationship.

A lot of events, parties, etc during the 3 nights. With club fees being as high as $100 for a couple, this doesn't seem too excessive.  The rooms are also steep. They are between $950 and $1250 for the three nights and many are already sold out. Seems SDC is heavily involved so if you are member over there, you could post in their forum to get some feedback of what others think.

Maybe that's true for some couples,  but I have a say and I'm not here to just fuck anybody cause my wife has said she approves. My wife and I move forward when we are both comfortable with both partners.   If she thinks the husband is great but I think the wife is full of herself and annoying,  then I'll say no. I want to do stuff with women I find both physically and mentally attracted to. My wife doesn't control me any more than I control her.

From what I've read the Angels and Demons nights are their busiest, which seems like a decent way to just fade into the background and watch, if we weren't ready for more. But I haven't spoken to anyone who's been there before so I might have the wrong end of the stick."
Swingers,3aopoc,Syderknee,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, we've been once. It was a normal night, not just first timers, and it was pretty decent. There were plenty of young couples when we went (we're mid 20s ourselves). Atmosphere is typically very laid back at these clubs, you'll be surprised how normal and friendly people are, and you won't be obligated to do anything you don't want to.  We've also been to Our Secret Spot. We much prefer this venue, a lot more intimate/classy than Couples Club was. We went just a few weeks after it opened, and it was quite full, but a lot of people talking and not a lot of action. It's pretty well established now, so things have probably improved. The staff are great there too.  We haven't been to either in about a year now, but today we'd probably choose Our Secret Spot first."

I think Sydney has one of the younger swinger scenes in the world, and those who aren't young usually still look amazing, so I wouldn't really worry so much about age."
Swingers,3aopoc,TilSwingdomCome,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:13:26 2015 UTC,"Ohh great, that sounds relieving! May be a bit of a weird question, but the whole reason we decided to look into swinging is because it was to difficult finding another girl for a threesome (You'd be suprised how many dating profiles looking for couples are actually dudes.) But my question was how common is it for single women to attend?"
Swingers,3aopoc,neb8neb,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:22:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but it's highly unlikely. Every couple seems to be just looking for a threesome when they first start out, but there's simply little reason for a single woman to go to a club like this to get action. It does happen sometimes though.  My advice is to be open to playing with a couple. You want to experience another girl, well your female half probably wouldn't mind trying something with another guy too. There will still be plenty of girl-on-girl action, and times when both girls will give one guy some attention together. Just don't go to a club with the intention of luring just the girl away from a couple, couples will not be receptive to that, and its not fair to the one guy standing at the sidelines."

Swingers,3aopoc,neb8neb,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:44:39 2015 UTC,Would you be able to tell us how a typical night plays out? What are the rules and protocols. We really have little idea how this all works
Swingers,3aopoc,neb8neb,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:46:09 2015 UTC,"Sure. Turn up after 10ish (byob) and then sit and chill upstairs in the bar area. Chat to people, get to know a few then at some point someone will say ""shall we head to the hot tub?"" or whatever. Then the party heads downstairs to the changing rooms, gets naked and it goes from hot tub making out to ""let's go next door and fuck like rabbits"".  Now obviously that's a really specific example, but you get the idea. Very chilled,  no one will do anything if you say ""no"".  It tends to get a lot busier after midnight, but first timers it's worth getting there early to chat. There will be people far older than you but don't worry, the ages are pretty mixed. I'd say on average late 20s to early 50s but I've seen 70+ and 20 year olds.  Downstairs is pretty much just naked people but they give you a towel and a sarong if you're worried about that.   There are toilets and showers and condoms everywhere. No really complaints from us!  One thing I will say is that having been to clubs in the UK, Sydney is super expensive. The couples club is $50 each for couples right? (Can't remember) but here it's 1/4 that most times.  If you find yourself looking for single couple meetups check out redhotpie.com.au - we met some gun couples through that."

Swingers,3almlr,the_red_scimitar,4,Sun Jun 21 14:31:35 2015 UTC,"I dont think this has anything to do with emotions. Discretion is an extremely important aspect of this to MANY people here, even when emotions aren't a part of it...especially when divulging details to vanillas. As far as I'm concerned, most vanillas will never understand what we do, so allowing them to be privy to information about your marriage that's so counter to their world is very risky.    With that said, has he always told everything about your lives to his friends? If so, then you knew this might happen and you shouldn't expect a different behavior.  If this is a new pattern of behavior, then maybe he's just excited and being a braggart...and throwing caution to the wind.  Either way, you're going to need to start talking to him now about why he wants to cross boundaries that make you uncomfortable. You may want to tell him that some of the best success in this lifestyle comes only when the women feel completely at ease, and that means working within their set boundaries. If he continues to cross that line, then maybe your extra-curricular activities need a break until he can learn to play nice."

Swingers,3almlr,mbatthew,2,Mon Jun 22 12:23:16 2015 UTC,"I have a partner with no subject boundaries, apparently. She will rather freely talk about anything, and her relationships and personal experiences feature prominently. When I got into NM, my partner was similar, but a bit more discreet. Still, she talked a lot about other partners.  Perhaps it was that early exposure, or just my own bent, but I really don't mind it at all. If somebody wants to disclose something, and doesn't want to be personally identified, I'm that guy. That doesn't mean I won't mention an experience, or even write about it, but I most certainly will assure the other person/people are not identifiable. To be sure, this has once bent out of shape a former partner when I wrote on reddit about an experience with her. Of course, there was nothing at all to place the experience in time, location, or personnel, but because SHE knew, and had bothered to creep my posts, she was upset. I won't even apologize for such things, and told her there was nothing identifiable, and that the experience was mine. And that is my viewpoint.  But when it comes to me talking more personally with anybody, where the chance of recognition might exist, I generally won't talk about such things with any detail at all, and I certainly won't pin any specific intimate act on any partner when talking with personal friends and partners. That is, unless they've given permission.   I guess the rule is just this: My experiences with partners are mine, but anything that might embarrass the person personally to others, even by association, is avoided.   I would suggest you make your requirements for the privacy of your relationship experiences known. What I personally won't do is hide the fact of having a relationship with somebody. That is, I will not keep a relationship a secret, and if a partner wants that, it's done, as the scent of cheating enters into it at that point."
Swingers,3almlr,NWBoomer,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:08:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for your advice. I feel like I've now communicated how I feel and I think we've made an agreement that will fulfil both our desires to be swingers and my need for privacy.

I haven't told anyone in quite some time, but my close circle of friends hasn't changed.    I couldn't understand why my husband wouldn't want to tell his friends.  But he didn't/doesn't and I learned to respect it.  I really didn't have a choice, if I wanted to be respectful of our relationship and the lifestyle.  He basically said If I kept telling people he would want to stop.  That its not something he wants everyone to know and I need to respect his feelings on this.  So Yea, I got it... and I no longer tell anyone.     I do think that if you explain this to your partner he will get it.  Perhaps, like me, he just really enjoys sharing it with people.  It will need a stern talk from you, for him to get you are really serious about this.   Best of luck..."

We have revealed our swinging to a few select friends but we have disclosed it together as a couple. I think you should speak to him about disclosing it further to others; perhaps in the context of not wanting to ruin a good thing you have going already."
Swingers,3almlr,Swingersbaby,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:55:34 2015 UTC,"You definitely need to express the extent of your disappointment to him. He must understand what you need from him for things to continue. Having you feel betrayed, no matter how other may think that it is no big deal, IS a BIG DEAL to you. That feeling will definitely cause resentment and eventually damage your relationship with each other.   This is one of those things that a couple must communicate about if they are to be successful in the LS. This subject should be a no brainer. An occasional slip of the lip can happen but being clueless about the privacy concerns of your spouse/SO in swinging is another thing entirely.  Before you guys go any further, get this worked out.

Once I've let them know our lack of interest, I've never gotten back a ""thanks for letting us know"" or anything.  which I find hard because it's a tough decision and tough on me.  But fair.

BUT if we don't immediately go gaga over your pics what we usually do is say hey, meet us at the club, we'll be there on X date, and we give them a fair shot.  Some couples though won't accept that, they keep pushing for the private 2 on 2 date, and frankly we don't have the time or money or motivation to go out and meet every couple individually that expresses interest. It requires a lot of logistics with babysitting and so forth and it's not cheap and we can only ""budget"" so much money for this little hobby. So that's when we stop communicating because they aren't taking the hint."

Swingers,3akmc6,RichardMNixon42,2,Sun Jun 21 03:09:22 2015 UTC,We like watching the dancing at clubs but are not into doing it. We would rather be swimming or in a hot tub naked to meet people.   Figure out where you want to go to meet people and put it in your profile and see how many people hit you up to meet there. Maybe you will end up with a local group that you somehow started with cool meet and greets. :)
Swingers,3akmc6,usewhippedcream,2,Sun Jun 21 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"We really wish there were more event types than just on-premise parties and ""clubs"" but we've never seen any.  Clubs / bars / parties etc are always the same. Everyone congregates around the bar in this huge mess of people and forms little cliques of folks who already know each other.  It would be nice to see some more facilitation from hosts, like maybe dance lessons for swingers, or other games or what have you, that force interaction between the old timers and newbies, because it is REALLY hard for some newbies to break the ice at these things, heck even us if we go to a new venue we've never tried, we feel like newbies all over again."

That and just the general club consensus of ""club opens at 9, so definitely don't show up until midnight."" Even weirder that it was a hotel so people were already there, just waiting to be seen at the proper time. We would like to sleep eventually."

This group of people we have established share different homes hosting parties, new people have come into the group that others have met. We also have hosted parties ourselves. And we have done non swinging things with this group as well, meet at comedy clubs, weekends at the coast, etc.  Have you thought about hosting a party of couples you have already met at your home or a motel? Often couples you know will ask if they can bring along another couple you may not know. Assume your known friends have vetted the unknown couple.   For motel parties we have usually book a suite then everyone attending chips in."

Swingers,3akfwg,gottathrowaway16172o,2,Sun Jun 21 01:59:52 2015 UTC,"I love the dialog that is taking place concerning HSV. It's a conversation that needs to happen. Earlier this year I thought I was going to die when I received the phone call from the gynos office. It's been a series of emotions to process but ultimately we decided that we didn't want to give up on the LS but rather educate. The worst part (for me, I've never had an outbreak) is the stigma.   I didn't play for months. HSVSwing.com is useless (at least in our geographical location). So we made the choice to hang out with our LS friends. We formed a friendship with a couple and then disclosed, educated, encouraged them to educate themselves, and think it over. ( I wasn't concerned about them being pissed I didn't disclose within the first five minutes of meeting.) They talked over the risk and we played. It wasn't sexy, it wasn't in the heat of some great moment but it was necessary. But guess what? the sex was amazing even if the prior conversation sucked.   Yes, HSV has changed our play style. We will not being going out on random hookups. What we have gained is friends that we truly trust. These people knew that saying I have HSV was a really fucking hard thing to do. I know it won't always work out this beautifully but it's the honest way of doing things..sexy or not.    My heart goes out to you."

They both get something out of it.    You seem to be scratching your head trying to figure out what you get out of this... how does it deepen your relationship?  I'm scratching my head too.   I think it's great you are understanding of her past and we're not judgemental,  however, I think you need to really st down with your girlfriend and discuss what you both want out of this going forward.    Is she just being a good Samaritan and that's cool with you both?    Does she get sexual satisfaction from it? Is that a turn on for you?   Is this something that you can both use as a sexual fetishes to play with and incorporate into your relationship?  As someone said, can you watch if that would be a turn on?   Have you asked - do you even get a vote? If you say no, is that OK with her? If not,  why?   If she continues and you aren't happy about it, then no, that's not swinging.   You guys need to talk and figure out what version of this will be the most rewarding for you both.   Good luck."

Swingers,3ai3n2,wifeisn2girls2,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:03:28 2015 UTC,"I get your point of view, and I certainly did not intend to be degrading to anyone. However, ""swinging"" not a very defined classification. Any sort of sexual chemistry at all that you and your partner allow each other to have with other people could be considered ""swinging"". There is no clear, ubiquitous definition, so that label is largely useless.    Identify yourself however you like, but this particular label is so subjective, it's about the same as identifying yourself as promiscuous."
Swingers,3ai3n2,Nice-Rapist,2,Sun Jun 21 13:36:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, swinging is well defined by 99% of the people in the lifestyle.  The people who typically want to avoid the label, or who don't like the label, are those who aren't your traditional married, full-swap couple.  I have nothing against anyone else who does things differently within the lifestyle, but that's the standard definition that the vast majority of swingers have."

Don't think so..."
Swingers,3ai3n2,Nice-Rapist,3,Sat Jun 20 16:38:22 2015 UTC,"No, but if someone said it's silly to call yourself a nudist, nudists would be offended.  How about, ""it's silly to label yourself as a doctor, nurse or firefighter""?"

Those of us who understand sexuality is fluid and nebulous, we'll either label ourselves so we don't feel as if we're being wild and crazy, or we'll avoid labeling ourselves because it's impossible to label."

Some of us won't put up with that BS, we like to live life, be free of crap imposed by people who have nothing better to do.

There are very few single women in the lifestyle that I am interested in, so I'd have to venture out into the vanilla dating world, and honestly out there there's lots of hot women but very few are interested in being FWB with a married guy, and likewise I don't have the time, energy or money to ""date"" single women either.  We do play solo - with a couple we are good friends with. That's kind of our arrangement, we are ok with solo play when we both have options. We have the occasional single person over for threesomes (male and female) but it's not often.  Also even though casual sex grows on trees for attractive women, it's dangerous. Guys are cheaters. Initially I was more conservative but honestly now I'd say 9 out of 10 ""single men"" looking to meet women in the lifestyle are looking for an easy way to step out on somebody. Yes, that many."

While separate play may provide a short term solution for that (out of sight, out of mind), but the underlying issue is still there.   I'd say she's not really ready for the lifestyle.

Swingers,3afyhz,mnswing,-1,Sat Jun 20 00:25:48 2015 UTC,"This is true. I've been worried that she isn't as open to this as she seems. Her first husband told her after marriage, ""this is what we're doing. "" which she did at first, she says, to make him happy. Then, she enjoyed it, she likes sex and is very liberal in her freedom with sex. After she left him, he was abusive, she got into polyamory on her own. So, I think she has interest, but it causes her issues seeing as how she was introduced to things. Again, we're talking about psychology and emotional motivation here. Just because someone tells you they want something for themselves, not just to make you happy, you can't always be sure they aren't telling you that to make you happy and not rock the boat. Maybe, this is something she can live with, but she would be happier if we remained monogamous and she's telling me all of this out of fear. Who wants to lose someone they love over an unfavorable issue that is tolerable?"

I think you guys have a LOT to work through. If you're not sure she's telling you everything, then that sounds like a lack of communication, and another reason you two should not be swinging.   Frankly, I'd be worried about your relationship. Between a little lack of communication, her being insecure in your relationship, and her strong desire to have sex outside the relationship, and you guy sabbling in seperate room play, there's a dangerous mix of negative factors at work here that could result in disaster to the relationship."

Swingers,3aeq1d,MidwestSwingers,7,Fri Jun 19 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"One of the best things you can do as an introvert in the lifestyle, is teach yourself to be more extroverted.  I understand it isn't easy, but the benefits are enormous.    You post here a lot, and have some excellent questions.  Instead of asking them on reddit, go to a club/party/meet and greet, and ask some of the experienced couples there.  The hosts at parties are normally great people to talk to - they'll be busy much of the time, but they'll find someone they know to help you out.    You'll never be the chattiest person at a party, but start learning to be more outgoing and you'll see the benefits in other facets of your life too!"
Swingers,3aeq1d,Nice-Rapist,3,Fri Jun 19 16:00:05 2015 UTC,"One of the best things you can do as an introvert in the lifestyle, is teach yourself to be more extroverted. I understand it isn't easy, but the benefits are enormous.   We're a moderately shy couple, so we welcomed the mildly extroverted swinger crowd at Hedonism during our first trip there.  It made it so much easier to engage in conversation since everyone was so outgoing.  If too many people there were like us, it would end up being like a vanilla resort where everyone keeps to themselves.  By immersing ourselves into an outgoing crowd, it helped draw us out more and we easily slipped into conversations with others without much effort on our own.  I loved it, but I can see where too much of a good thing would get old.  In everything, moderation.  Too much talking can get annoying."
Swingers,3aeq1d,STL-MO-CPL,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"I love outgoing people more than anything. Like you said, it makes it easier for shy people to engage in conversation, but to us there's a difference between outgoing people and people who like to talk so much that we can't get our own word in.  Case in point: Or realtor is outgoing and extroverted, but she enjoys asking questions and getting to know people. On the other hand, this couple is outgoing and extroverted as well, but the guy talks and talks and talks, sometimes about stuff I couldn't care less about. It gets really annoying.  The more I discuss it here and the more I talk to my wife about it, the more it makes sense to just find another couple to hang out with, but it just seems weird to end things with this couple just because the guy doesn't shut up."
Swingers,3aeq1d,ref2018,-1,Fri Jun 19 18:02:34 2015 UTC,the guy might be doing cocaine or meth before and during these sessions. Those two drugs often make many people run their mouths nonstop.

It seems analogous to him telling you to talk more."
Swingers,3aeq1d,MatticusVP,2,Fri Jun 19 15:26:33 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I are also introverts. We do enjoy occasionally hanging around extroverted people, but like you, only for so long. When we hang out with extroverts, either in or outside of swinging, we just cut our night short once we've had enough. I think you have the right idea with ""scaling back the amount of time you spend with them, and when you do hang out, make sure not to stay super late"" Thats the best way we've managed to be friends with extroverts."

They're really nice, young people that we can relate to. For us, we don't come across that much in the lifestyle, so we kind of cherish our friendship with them.""    So, with that said, either enjoy them for what they are, or move on.  No need to try to ""deal"" with how someone is...exhaustion is a killer in the lifestyle."
Swingers,3aeq1d,flwrsme,2,Fri Jun 19 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"Find another couple. Since both of you are introverts, a strong extrovert can literally (not figuratively) suck the energy out of both of you. It takes enough energy for introverts to interact with normal people and other introverts, it is simply exhausting to hang out with extroverts. You don't want to be mentally drained even before you get to play. You want to be physically exhausted and mentally stimulated."

Don't feel too bad for not being knee deep in action from the 'net, most of it is smoke and mirrors.  About all we do anymore is post to Cragislist for areas we're planning on traveling to as kind of a pre-farming strategy. If there's any action on SLS in your area, that can be a good way to find out about local parties and the like."
Swingers,3adwas,Harry_Teak,3,Fri Jun 19 13:21:20 2015 UTC,We use websites to find parties and clubs.  Dating to swing is tooo much work and too many flakes.

Swingers,3adwas,larebelde,2,Fri Jun 19 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"We actually started with hotel parties. Back then our play was very limited. We found some single guys and they did some light play with my wife as I went down on her.  Approach a couple and introduce yourself. Politely complement the wife/female partner. Let them know you'd be interested in joining them for some fun IF they'd be interested as well, then excuse yourself and go freshen your drink. This will give them a chance to discuss between themselves if you'd fit into their plans. Maybe don't even go right back to them. Go observe something else and if you catch either one of the couple looking at you, smile and wave. If you're going to watch some people who are already playing, DO IT FROM A DISTANCE. Don't get right up close to them or it will likely be seen as VERY creepy.  Don't go into a hotel party expecting a great deal. You'll likely get to watch some hot action and if you're that nice guy who showed interest you may get the call to join in.  Good luck."
Swingers,3adwas,happycouple247,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"We primarily use Quiver.us but have also used SLS.com to meet plenty of people.  We've had better hit to miss ratios with Quiver despite the membership being lower, because Quiver is more social, meaning we'll have more interaction with a couple before we bother to meet them. It also allows us to screen only verified couples which SLS does not.   SLS has a ton of members, it's where most people go. As a result, all the fakes and scammers know and use the website, and you have to filter them out. Also, there's a lot of lookie-loos, a lot of scared newbies, and as a result a lot of plans end up going nowhere because people chicken out or they have drama on their end."
Swingers,3adwas,jollycooperation420,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:39:46 2015 UTC,"For us, swinger website have been a great resource for finding other couples, but as people have mentioned, you will get some flakes and odd people responding. A few things we have learned (some the hard way!)   Swinger websites can be very regional. For us, a website that had a LOT of great couples in one part of the country was a dud when we moved, but we found a couple of sites that had a LOT of great couples in our area. Just because the site has a big rep doesn't mean it will be great for your area. Your profile will make a huge difference. Make it really clear what you are looking for and what you are NOT looking for. And try to write up a nice decent sized profile that lets people get a really good feel for who you are. Yeah, even though you may say ""Sorry, no single males!"" you will still get a lot of those, we have have found a good profile makes a difference. For us, before we actually get together with a couple, my wife needs to talk to the other wife. It is not uncommon for a guy to post a profile and connect with you and then you get a ""Oh, my wife couldn't make it, but we can play anyway!"" We haven't had that happen but have heard others tell it.   Bottom line, for us, online websites (for us SLS and swingvillage are the ones that have a lot of great couples in our area) are a great resource."
Swingers,3adwas,twoormoretotango,0,Sat Jun 20 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"We go online. Right now we use Quiver over the other sites as its beginning to grow in our area.

Occasionally we'll use craigslist. but it requires a lot screening, though we get some laughs from a lot of the replies as well.

Swingers,3aaxg0,STL-MO-CPL,2,Thu Jun 18 21:56:56 2015 UTC,You really should go to one of the Young Swingers Week events.  We had travelled to Hedonism II a couple of times previously which was a good time.  Then we went with YSW and it was on a whole other level.  They keep the fun going all day and even get the club going at night which we know other groups tend to neglect.   I could go on and on but it's just a much more fun vibe and energy when they do their events.
Swingers,3aaxg0,johnny_chest,2,Fri Jun 19 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"We've been to Hedo twice, and have yet to set foot in the nightclub.  We're a disgrace!  Our routine usually went dinner, theme night/show, piano bar, hot tub, bedtime.  We're too predictable."

Swingers,3acqft,NotReallyBi,3,Fri Jun 19 01:32:15 2015 UTC,"Every major city in the US has multiple clubs - get on SLS and look at the calendar.      Change your profile zip code to a city you would like to visit, expand your search to 250 miles, and look on the calendar of events for events on Fri & Sat night.      See who is signed up and decide if you want to go.  We go to clubs and rarely put our name on the guest list, we just show up as do most of the regulars.  The owners advertise on multiple websites so only seeing the guest list from SLS or SDC or LL may not be representative of who is actually in attendance.    We are party people and do not internet date.  Too man flakes, fakes and liars."
Swingers,3acqft,louisvillemojo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:55:36 2015 UTC,"We kinda do this. When we first started getting interested in swinging, we were to scared to ''play at home'' so we always traveled to a different city that had a cool looking club. We have kids, so a weekend away was always nice, and if we planned on a cool city we could plan other things to do so it was a good time even if it turned out we didn't like the club.   We usually kept it pretty close to home. For example, we live in Ky, and we Love to go down to Nashville and check out the sites and then hit Club Menages. Or we go up to Cincinatti, or Columbus, or Chicago. Just think of some Major City's near you where you could get away fro a weekend and then google city name and swinger club, most large citys will have one close.   Personally, we have never tried a cruise so I can't help with that one, but we didn't like a resort vacation option at first because we felt pressured to ''do'' something to make it ''worth'' it if that makes sense. A quick weekend away to check out a new (to us) club while also checking out whatever that city has to offer is a lot of fun. Even when we didn't like the club, we never felt like it was a waste because there was so much else to do. Happy Travels!"
Swingers,3acqft,louisvillemojo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:05:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, and We haven't ever been to a single club where it was not ok just to watch. I remember being scared to talk to people at first because we were scared if we said hi we would be leading them on and making them think we wanted more. Once we got over that and relized we ALWAYS have the option to say ''no thanks'' we have always meet some really great people. I personally think swingers clubs are the best around. Most people there are 100 times more respectful then the drunk people in a normal bar. For example, around here, a woman out on the dance floor will end up with some drunk guy pawing at her and having to say No a million times to everyone who will want in on the action, but at the swingers club, People always ask before touching you, and will usually ask before even trying to dance with you. The enviroment is just better. If you live near any of these area's, pm me and I will give you my thoughts on the clubs near by."
Swingers,3acqft,tidder_nhoj,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:11:49 2015 UTC,"I suggest that you look at Sea Mountain Inn (SMI) near Palm Springs, CA. But (especially if it's a long and expensive trip) be very sure to read everything you can about it. They have a mildly active Yahoo group, and you can search here and the more general internet. I'd describe it as 'nudism with benefits - lots of benefits'. Generally similar in concept to the better-known (and larger) Desire resorts."

Swingers,3acqft,the_TX,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:32:07 2015 UTC,"It kind of depends on how much you want to spend and how far you want to travel. There are dozens of clubs on the east coast that do very well, both in popularity and in quality. There are more outside the US in the Caribbean and eastern Mexico. There are clubs open nightly and there are resorts that are all inclusive. There are ocean cruises that are for nothing but swingers.   You are going to get 1000 different opinions from 1000 different people on which is the best. Everyone has their favorite, usually in their home area or in a favorite vacation location.   You can do a couple of things. One is to just pick one nearby and go to it, judging it for yourself. Another is to look for reviews of clubs in other cities within driving distance and try them. Another is to pick the largest on the east coast, check NASCA and your swing website (SLS, SDC, LL, etc) and travel for a weekend or more.   No matter how you figure it out, it is going to take some work on your part to have the best chance of you having the best time. Outside of that, you would need to rephrase your question to find someone that has been to a very large number of clubs across the entire east coast and then rely on their review. But that is about as likely as picking the best club out of a hat.  Frankly, we would not spend a lot of money to travel someplace for vacation to go to a club that we figured we'd only be voyeurs/exhibitionists. We'd want to play with others. We can stay home and be voyeurs/exhibitionists. But that is just us."
Swingers,3acqft,STL-MO-CPL,2,Fri Jun 19 04:55:55 2015 UTC,Exactly this.  Your information request is very subjective.  Limiting to the US is tough.  We love Desire Resort in Cancun.  It runs the full gambit of lifestyle choices.
Swingers,3ab3m7,SHFunCouple,3,Thu Jun 18 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"Trapeze is our favorite place in the world! Here are some suggestions: 1) Go on a Saturday, do not go on Friday, you are not going to enjoy the parade of single guys. 2) Bring a bag with sandals or flip flops, you don't want to walk on the playrooms floor barefoot. My husband likes to bring a shower wrap, but towels are provided. 3) As soon as you check in, go directly to the lockers and reserve a locker where you can put all your things.  At around 11, when everybody goes to the playrooms it gets very crowded, so it's better to reserve your locker early. 4) Arrive early. Trapeze offers a wonderful buffet, arrive at 8:30 when the music is not too loud and you can eat and connect with other couples. 5) Enjoy the dancing.  That's the place where you will meet other sexy couples and start to flirt with them. 6) At around 11pm people go to the playrooms, you have to change your clothes and stay in towels only or lingerie. 7) Don't miss breakfast: starts at 1 am with a great selection of eggs, made to order omelettes and waffles, etc. Trapeze is an upscale club, I've heard that it's much better than Menages, it's clean and the crowd is sexy and all ages, from the mid 30s to the late 50s. There are several private playrooms and several open playrooms.  People are very respectful and always open to talk if you approach them. Yes, it is very clean and nice! We are members of the Diamond Club, the VIP area of Trapeze, in order to get there you need to be a member, and that is a yearly membership fee.  However, I think you can pay extra if you are out of town and are visiting.  The Diamond Club is like the Ritz Carlton for swingers with a separate bar, satin sheets on the beds, beautifully decorated private rooms, 2 gorgeous play rooms and a great atmosphere.  I hope this helps."
