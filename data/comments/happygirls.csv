If there is too much bottom teeth, please go to our sister sub. Please flair whether your picture is real or a model.  Report overly-shown or dominant bottom teeth.   SOOOO apparently they think a model isn't a real girl, and have an aversion to bottom teeth. And apparently there is a TOOTH fetish I wasn't aware of and am not likely to adopt."

happygirls,2w1vyw,Vranak,8,Mon Feb 16 06:18:50 2015 UTC,"She didn't play the mom. She was the ""sister"" of Dick, played by John Lithgow, who was the ""dad"" of Tommy, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Then there was Harry, Dicks ""brother"", played by French Stewart."
happygirls,2w1vyw,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:06:10 2015 UTC,"Section 8. Main characters of article  3rd Rock from the Sun:        John Lithgow as Dick Solomon: The High Commander and head of the expedition to Earth, he is often the most childlike member of the group, being, ironically, the youngest of the crew, despite being the oldest family member (at least appears to be the oldest due to his body). Much of the behavioral or societal-based troubles faced by the crew in their mission while on Earth frequently arise from some juvenile act perpetrated by Dick, troubles which in turn are forced to be overcome by the entire troupe with a great deal of reluctance. Kristen Johnston as Sally Solomon: With a rank of lieutenant, she is the security officer and second-in-command. She has been called Dick’s sister, but was sometimes introduced as 'Tommy's' sister earlier in the series, and, on one occasion, claimed to be his mother, although never Dick's daughter and certainly not his spouse; failure to clarify the exact relationship between Tommy, Harry, and Sally led to humorous confusion whenever either Harry or Sally attempted to act as Tommy's guardian. Sally was chosen to be the woman because she apparently lost some sort of contest and was not too thrilled about it; while the alien species is described as asexual, Sally seems to have a harder time trying to figure out womanhood than the others do manhood. She files a request to be made male early in the mission, though later decides she liked being a woman, despite the fact that she is tall, drop-dead beautiful, and a warrior. A later episode had Dick and her switching bodies on orders from the Big Giant Head, which caused much confusion both on their part, as they has gotten used to their respective genders while on Earth, and the other characters, as they could not get used to Sally acting like Dick and vice-versa. French Stewart as Harry Solomon: Originally, he was not part of the mission, but just happened to go for the ride because an extra seat was available. Later, it becomes known that a chip is in his head, and he becomes the Communicator or Transmitter. Occasionally, he gets a message from the Solomons' leader, the Big Giant Head, and shakes violently in the middle of a sentence and squats down, with his arms at 90° angles, declaring ""Incoming message from the Big Giant Head!"", before going through the motions of delivering the message, which always ends with a violent sneeze. He poses as Dick and Sally's brother, and Tommy's uncle. Harry is often known to be the simplest family member, is occasionally impulsive and misunderstands people. He is also sometimes prone to misfortune. Though he seems to fit in on Earth with the earthlings better than anyone else, it is implied this is because he is seen as dimwitted. It is unclear, however, whether he is really dimwitted or just more sensitive to his surroundings. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tommy Solomon: Information officer and third-in-command behind Sally, Tommy plays the role of Dick's adolescent son, yet he is the oldest and smartest of all the aliens. Throughout the series, Tommy continually reminds the others of his superior intelligence and greater age. Gordon-Levitt left the series (after the fifth season concluded) as a primary character, only appearing as a recurring character in just over half the episodes of season six. In the show this is explained by Tommy's graduating from high school and moving out to college. Jane Curtin as Dr. Mary Albright: Dick's colleague and on-and-off girlfriend, Mary is aware that Dick as an insensitive idiot, but appreciates his joie de vivre and quirkiness. Reference is often made to the insecurity caused by her bad parenting, and the fact that before Dick arrived, she was known for sleeping around, and had even been nicknamed ""Dr. Slutbunny"". Simbi Khali as Nina Campbell (seasons 3-6, recurring previously): Dick's and Mary's black administrative assistant, who finds Dick beyond the pale, is amazingly sharp and funny about his idiocies, commenting at one point, ""Dr. Solomon, when I look at you, I don't see 'color', I see a jackass."" However, they do a great swing dance number together. Elmarie Wendel as Mrs. Mamie Dubcek (seasons 3-6, recurring previously): Mrs. Dubcek is a ""blast from the past""—the sixties. She boasts of having danced naked with Jack Kerouac in a cage. Despite being the landlady, she has a friend to the Solomons, except when the rent is really late. Wayne Knight as Officer Don Leslie Orville (seasons 3-6, recurring previously): As Sally's boyfriend, he is an underachieving spineless police officer, who has a talent for romanticizing his rather mundane job. Sally is completely enraptured by his stories, and is reduced to simpering and giggling around him.

happygirls,2uv9hi,FalstaffBeer,7,Thu Feb 5 13:20:00 2015 UTC,Thus begins an endless cycle of revenge.
happygirls,2uv9hi,ExpatJundi,3,Thu Feb 5 16:29:25 2015 UTC,Cycle of violence?
happygirls,2uv9hi,amarigatachi,3,Thu Feb 5 18:31:42 2015 UTC,Yes. It's a vicious cycle.
happygirls,2uv9hi,ExpatJundi,2,Thu Feb 5 19:41:06 2015 UTC,"...you know, the beach cruiser... The one I let you use couple of weeks ago... The one I been asking about!"
happygirls,2uv9hi,daaave33,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:46:42 2015 UTC,"This would almost be at home in r/justiceporn lol. Can't believe there are people here suggesting she's in the wrong to retrieve her own personal property lmao! Maybe just to make sure the thief wasn't butthurt, she should've yelled back as she rode away ""just returning what you stole!"""
happygirls,2uv9hi,karmckyle,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:40:41 2015 UTC,Person. Singular.
happygirls,2uv9hi,ZhouLon,2,Thu Feb 5 20:06:20 2015 UTC,Ya all bike thieves carry hand gun. To shoot the lock off the chain to get to the bike.
happygirls,2uv9hi,karmckyle,1 point,Thu Feb 5 23:35:55 2015 UTC,"Are you a legit bike thief, or is this merely speculation?"
happygirls,2uv9hi,karmckyle,1 point,Fri Feb 6 02:12:56 2015 UTC,"Who doesn't take a gun to a Craigslist meetup, seriously. Especially If you're gonna pull some vigilante type shit. Plus, I doubt she was foolish enough to agree to meet in some dark secluded alley lol."
happygirls,2uv9hi,McGauth925,1 point,Fri Feb 6 04:14:32 2015 UTC,Hope she bought a good lock.
happygirls,2uv9hi,Jingy_,1 point,Fri Feb 6 04:15:30 2015 UTC,"As satisfying as that may have been, she still should have had the cops waiting with her at the meeting. That way she would have not only gotten her bike back, but gotten the asshole arrested.  (I was actually in the middle of typing this before I realized I wasn't in /r/bicycling )"
happygirls,2uv9hi,sdtacoma,-14,Thu Feb 5 21:45:50 2015 UTC,Two wrongs...
happygirls,2uv9hi,benny2012,6,Fri Feb 6 05:15:03 2015 UTC,If you consider what she did to be wrong.
happygirls,2uv9sl,FalstaffBeer,5,Thu Feb 5 13:23:31 2015 UTC,"She's perfect, ignoring the dreadlocks obviously."
happygirls,2uv9sl,barret141,2,Thu Feb 5 13:40:13 2015 UTC,She is super cute. I do not understand the appeal of having dirty hair.
happygirls,2uv9sl,seawaysea,5,Thu Feb 5 18:52:34 2015 UTC,"I have dreadlocks and they aren't any dirtier than your hair is. I wash my hair at the least 1 time a week, and I have for almost 7 years. No dandruff, no bugs, no bad smells, no crazy stories.  You shouldn't assume every person with dreadlocks is dirty; it's not true, more of an ignorant stereotype."
happygirls,2uv9sl,Kattwinkel,-1,Fri Feb 6 03:23:54 2015 UTC,1x a week??  go shower mayo child
happygirls,2uv9sl,heroiclatte,2,Fri Feb 6 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"Everyone's hair is different but washing it constantly when there is a lot of length is actually really bad for it. When I had long hair, it looked very unhealthy when I washed it everyday. When I started washing it twice a week and three times a week in the summer, it pretty much took care of it self and made bad hair days a memory."
happygirls,2uv9sl,smellyjerk,1 point,Sun Feb 8 01:18:53 2015 UTC,2-3x a week is different than almost once a week...maybe..sometimes... ok never
happygirls,2uv9sl,heroiclatte,1 point,Sun Feb 8 07:38:23 2015 UTC,"This girl is hot, don't judge and stereotype others."
