Ohio,3e2gbt,TheRealFender,5,Tue Jul 21 13:12:08 2015 UTC,Jesus fucking christ that's horrifying.  And he wants to run for President??
Ohio,3e2gbt,JohnStamosBRAH,4,Tue Jul 21 19:43:20 2015 UTC,He announced today.
Ohio,3e0m7x,OhioBob,4,Tue Jul 21 01:13:38 2015 UTC,Also found near Toledo - http://trekohio.com/2013/07/03/a-native-cactus-of-ohio/
Ohio,3e0m7x,Kyle197,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:57 2015 UTC,I'll be heading down to Adams County Wednesday to explore the prairies and other goodies located there. Finding a Prickly Pear is at the top of my list when there!
Ohio,3e0m7x,Kyle197,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:27 2015 UTC,No prickly pear there - but I highly recommend both Lynx Prairie Trail and Chaparral Prairie SNP. Prairie flowers blooming and lots of butterflies at both.
Ohio,3e0m7x,ecapstime,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:52 2015 UTC,I'm very familiar with both places. Lynx Prairie might be my favorite place in Ohio.
Ohio,3e0m7x,Red_Tannins,2,Tue Jul 21 02:44:16 2015 UTC,My brother fell into a patch of these in our woods when we were little. Mom had to pull about 100 of those tiny orange spikes out of his ass with a tweezer lol
Ohio,3dy208,gAlienLifeform,13,Mon Jul 20 13:53:01 2015 UTC,"You know, this guy is doing something right. He's pissing off both sides of the aisle"
Ohio,3dy208,Hornady1991,3,Mon Jul 20 17:47:09 2015 UTC,If only he could run for VP all the time
Ohio,3dy208,profmathers,3,Tue Jul 21 01:22:47 2015 UTC,He will never get past the primaries because he isn't insane.
Ohio,3dy208,JacketKeeper,6,Tue Jul 21 01:23:15 2015 UTC,"If there is no negative side effects (such as recreational use with detrimental effects), then there is no point in making it prescription only.  Good on Kasich for some common sense legislation (of whatever you call executive orders)."
Ohio,3dy208,Rhawk187,3,Mon Jul 20 20:29:25 2015 UTC,"Great move, pushing much needed legislation for our state that will help save lives. If anyone in this sub is interested in supporting Governor Kasich's upcoming campaign, I invite you to visit r/KasichForPresident."
Ohio,3dy208,mrsyuk,-2,Tue Jul 21 03:24:35 2015 UTC,Had to re-read that title a few times lol   Read like Kasich wanted to order everyone to take so much speed that their lives are saved
Ohio,3dy208,Ooobles,-3,Mon Jul 20 14:36:52 2015 UTC,Taking a lot of drugs is what it would take for me to think he would be a good president.
Ohio,3dy208,still_futile,6,Mon Jul 20 18:53:46 2015 UTC,"Out of all the Republicans running, he is the only one I would remotely consider voting for. Much more moderate than the rest of the current field"
Ohio,3dy208,sc1003,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:20 2015 UTC,He's a family man and I can get behind him
Ohio,3dy208,Ooobles,9,Mon Jul 20 19:03:33 2015 UTC,That doesn't work.  That drug war thing.  Legalizing heroin would be better for the health of Ohioans than ramping up the stupid drug war.  Heroin is a health issue.  Making everyone who does heroin into a criminal does not fix the drug problem.  They will do it anyway.  There is no way to stop the import of heroin except by controlling it through legalization.
Ohio,3dy208,NPVT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:39 2015 UTC,"Should be signing something to fight all the heroin coming into ohio, not giving addicts another opportunity to fuck up.   Are you suggesting he should instead be signing something like an Ohio state law that prohibits the distribution of heroin in Ohio?  It's already covered by state law: 2925.11 Possession of controlled substances."
Ohio,3ds4fz,cayerdis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:47:02 2015 UTC,2 sets?
Ohio,3ds4fz,LaughingAtIdiots,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:01:51 2015 UTC,As in 2 sets of a sheet and two pillow cases most likely. So a total of 2 sheets and 4 pillowcases.
Ohio,3ds4fz,irbilldozer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:32:53 2015 UTC,"Why do you need extra long sheets? If they are staying in a college dorm, regular twin sheets always worked just fine."
Ohio,3ds4fz,GingerCookie,2,Sun Jul 19 02:51:00 2015 UTC,"It's been a while, but my college dorm (Indiana U) required extra long twin sheets, because standard sized didn't fit."
Ohio,3ds4fz,Anne657,3,Sun Jul 19 04:59:37 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean. My dorm told us to buy XL twin but it wasn't actually necessary, regular sheets fit too."
Ohio,3ds4fz,GingerCookie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:54:12 2015 UTC,"Well, not all dorms are alike. It's quite possible that there are some dorms where standard size won't fit. Either way, the request is specifically for XL so I don't see any point in second guessing them when they very likely know better which size is needed than we do."
Ohio,3djrv7,michaelconfoy,4,Thu Jul 16 20:58:17 2015 UTC,I love these old photos. What's the story behind this place?
Ohio,3djrv7,velvta,2,Thu Jul 16 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_Park,_Cleveland  There was also one in Pittsburgh and Coney Island and elsewhere?"
Ohio,3dk8nw,westparkguy,7,Thu Jul 16 23:05:53 2015 UTC,"""Do you save? You can't spend all the money on fishing gear. You've got to put a little aside.""   Lmao okay Kasich. Let's divert some money from fishing to buy a house. It's so simple!"
Ohio,3dk8nw,Iyoten,6,Fri Jul 17 11:36:28 2015 UTC,That is an excellent summation of income inequality at work.
Ohio,3dk8nw,elderrage,12,Fri Jul 17 03:56:30 2015 UTC,"Title should be.....  CEO goes into a factory mandatory meeting and asks how things are going.  These people are busy and are hoping they will get paid for wasting time talking to a ""not announced, but planning to"" presidential candidate.  Not only is he wasting their time, he is wasting Ohio taxpayer's money talking to them. Come to my OHIO plant and ask our employees what they NEED, not want."
Ohio,3dkldy,abcdefghi76543,2,Fri Jul 17 00:55:16 2015 UTC,I'm not sure on the time - but you could exit 71 on US 36 and go to 42 and on south to 70.
Ohio,3dkldy,jmphotography,2,Fri Jul 17 01:13:05 2015 UTC,"Google shows I-71 South to Route 30 West to I-75 South to I-70 West as 5h 16min and 343 miles or I-80 West to Route 24 to Route 33 to I-69 South at 5h 6m and 329 miles versus the normal Columbus route at 4h 45 min and 315 miles.  If you want more back roads, pick up 42 South at Manfield, 36 West at Delaware then Route 4 at Marysville.  That will dump you on I-70 around Springfield."
Ohio,3dkldy,y2kse,2,Fri Jul 17 01:39:32 2015 UTC,I think I will do the route 42 way.  Thanks
Ohio,3dkldy,ZapfBrannigan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:14:50 2015 UTC,Route 30 is divided highway and lightly traveled. Taking that to 75 definitely avoids the north suburbs and doesn't add a while lot of time.
