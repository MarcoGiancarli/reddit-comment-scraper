ChildrenFallingOver,3dig7m,d0gmeat,-4,Mon Jul 20 02:13:57 2015 UTC,R/ChildrenFallingOver. See baby holding railing at top of the stairs. I swear I saw the railing move. Almost had a heart attack when I thought he was going to crash forward through the railing. Then I felt relief that he fell sideways.  That .gif knocked 6 months off my life.
ChildrenFallingOver,3dig7m,Sveenee,2,Thu Jul 16 15:32:52 2015 UTC,But then you realize he hit his head on the corner of the wall :(
