comicbookart,3cxcf3,ferncaz95,2,Sun Jul 12 11:30:21 2015 UTC,Booth is one of DC's top artists in my opinion. He's the only one that has drawn Red Robin's New 52 suit well.

comicbookart,3ctuih,WillElMagnifico,2,Fri Jul 10 22:58:36 2015 UTC,"This is Earth 2 Hawkgirl, Kendra Saunders. Not Shayera Hol/Shiera Sanders  This Hawkgirl got her powers by uncovering an ancient Egyptian tomb, which bestowed this gift upon her. She was previously a simple treasure hunter, but decided to use her gifts for good instead of continuing that lifestyle. She uses guns because why not? She doesn't have any other powers besides flying and minimal enhancements to strength and speed, so she uses guns to mess baddies up.  She's also an awesome detective, reminds me a bit of Batman when he was just starting out as a crime fighter  Here's more info"

comicbookart,3ctvu0,ThomsYorkieBars,3,Fri Jul 10 19:04:59 2015 UTC,"check out youtube videos for inking. this looks like it was inked with a chainsaw. keep at it, you'll only get better."
comicbookart,3ctvu0,KorranHalcyon,2,Fri Jul 10 22:24:37 2015 UTC,"Batman's arms are confusing the hell out of me. They look way too thick, the forearms look too short, and the hands don't line up. I think... like I said I can't really tell what's going on. Superman's hands should be bigger too since they're outstretched. They'd be much bigger than normal. Also, like the other dude said--practice inking. Ink's should create the form of your character. So if you're inking a bicep, the lines should curve like it's sitting on his arm--not straight. Straight makes no sense.   Hope that helps! Keep at it."
comicbookart,3ctvu0,Flightofstairs95,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:22:09 2015 UTC,Did you only use pens to ink for this?
comicbookart,3ctvu0,stephenhawkingruns,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:13:08 2015 UTC,"Yeh, unfortunately I don't have proper inks"
comicbookart,3ctvu0,stephenhawkingruns,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"If you're serious  about getting better at inking, i recommend getting a Rafael brush. i usually use a 2 point but it depends on how thick you want your lines. and as for Ink, i use bombay, its not the best but it works.  try to steer away from pens unless its for something thin you need inked."

comicbookart,3ct7j6,rap31264,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:45:08 2015 UTC,I didn't put reggie in because I felt his face was not as recognizable as the others in the archie gang. I new it had to be jughead and archie but the other buster was a challenge.
comicbookart,3cqe1g,ShawnDaley,3,Thu Jul 9 22:58:21 2015 UTC,Looks great man!! Did you use watercolor paints??
comicbookart,3cqe1g,curtdrum5b,2,Fri Jul 10 00:49:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's all ink and water, so no paints on this one."
comicbookart,3cqe1g,curtdrum5b,2,Fri Jul 10 01:08:39 2015 UTC,Thats so dope...I've been trying to work on inking and shading like this because I wanna get away from prismacolors/copics or just not use them as much. I just dig this style way more.
comicbookart,3cqe1g,DingDongSeven,2,Fri Jul 10 01:16:20 2015 UTC,"Pick up a few inks, experiment, and have fun. Water shading / textures are always a pleasure to work with."

comicbookart,3cjedg,thejesusfinger,8,Wed Jul 8 13:38:11 2015 UTC,"I just think it's hilarious that several certified, established pro's were well aware of his douch-ery and are only now co-siging it.   He's like that guy at bar that takes up three seats and keeps calling the bartender 'sweetheart'. Everyone ignores him until one person is asks, ""What's up with that guy?"" and then all the regulars are like, ""Oh, Arthur? Yeah, he's a bag of crap."""
comicbookart,3cjedg,RandyTheFool,6,Wed Jul 8 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"I've met him before at PHXCC, he was alright. Kind of quiet but not rude. I think this definitely steps over the line though and I would have immediately contacted the show-runners and discussed it with them and the guy who moved my stuff. The artists who were moved went in the wrong direction with this by simply grumbling on social media rather than trying to fix the problem at hand right then and there.  Honestly, as a vendor myself, I feel artist alley should have a table restriction. If you're buying, say, more than 3 tables... You should be ""encouraged"" to buy a booth instead. Artist alley is meant for people who are both local that are looking to tap their local geek market to become more successful, and for those well known artists who can throw a sketchbook on a table and do commissions all day and not take up a bunch of space. Not for the guy with 10,000 prints and needs to hang up every single one.  Brian Pulido (of lady death fame) is great for this! He buys a booth which equals 4 tables (typically) and spreads out all his prints and books. This is the way it should be done. And he's probably spending maybe $100-$200 more for a booth rather than tables. He's able to spread out, and he's not in anyone's way or crowding folks.  Let the little guys who need the recognition buy the cheaper tables. This guy, on the other hand spreads out to the size of a complete booth in order to save a buck. I'd rather have 4 different artists in artist alley, than one guy taking over a whole row with the same stuff."
comicbookart,3cjedg,sloowshooter,4,Wed Jul 8 14:35:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. It really just comes down to a complete lack or respect for other people. There's a certain type of asshole that is so used to getting their way, that they blame other people for not putting up a fight.   Was it really worth damaging your own reputation and not shelling out money for a booth? Sheesh."
comicbookart,3chf6w,scarwiz,8,Tue Jul 7 22:51:40 2015 UTC,a storytelling master. no doubt.
comicbookart,3chf6w,frankfiorentino,7,Tue Jul 7 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"For the scene that has been done a million times, it's amazing that an artist can bring something new to the table. The resulting angelic halo is pretty remarkable."

But, and I hope this is not one of those ""once you see it, it will nag at you"" things like it was for me, there's plenty of panels where he draws a smirk on the character's lips at completely random, even highly inappropriate moments.  Even here, Martha Wayne seems to be smiling as she gets shot. It drives me bonkers."
comicbookart,3chf6w,SlaughterMeister,3,Wed Jul 8 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"I think her half smile kind of fits here. But I definitely agree that Capullo's art isn't flawless. Just that when he hits, he hits hard  And I've definitely seen those random smirks!"
comicbookart,3chf6w,tremblemortals,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:09:29 2015 UTC,There are plenty of occasions when people have a smirk-like expression on their faces when they aren't actually smiling.
comicbookart,3chf6w,Go_Arachnid_Laser,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:53:41 2015 UTC,"My impression:  The smile is there because she realizes she's in the process of joining her husband. One moment she is concerned she's losing him. With the moment of impact, though she realizes she's lost as well, she also realizes that they won't be apart for long. It's kind of a ""Well, at least that's over"" sort of thing."
comicbookart,3chf6w,tremblemortals,3,Wed Jul 8 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think it's intentional. To me, he's trying to give her an expression of surprise and despair.  It's just that Capullo has this tendency to arch upwards the sides of his mouths."
