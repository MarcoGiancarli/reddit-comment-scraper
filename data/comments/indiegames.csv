Edit: Saw the 2nd portion of your question - I like Steam for its convenience, but I do like DRM free when I can get it. I will buy from a site that I know and trust, so if it's a newer indie company I'll probably avoid ordering directly from their site unless a lot of other people can vouch for them."

It's a bit of a disservice to the viewer (and the dev) to not even try.  There is nothing wrong with being too frightened to play a game. However, I felt that you unfairly held this against the game. You mention that you couldn't skip the night segments, and the creatures you are hunting come out at night. Yet, you just sat in base and didn't do anything during the night segment as you were too afraid to venture out."
indiegames,3dn604,durrandi,3,Fri Jul 17 21:42:28 2015 UTC,"Really? It's a bit of a disservice to the viewer (and the dev) to not even try.   Not really. I agree I should have tried them, and I will next time, but I have a GTX970 video card. I absolutely should not be getting anything less than 60 on this game when I can run The Witcher 3 max settings at a constant 60fps. If I had a less powerful rig I think I would have left this part out, but it is near impossible to say this wasn't an issue as it stands. I'd be doing a disservice to leave it out.   You mention that you couldn't skip the night segments, and the creatures you are hunting come out at night.    Yeah, I think so too. I am just learning to review, and I can confirm that my process is already much more thorough in the reviews I am working on now. That said, I made sure to mention that I didn't leave the cabin. ""Boring"" was just the impression I got.  I'll try and improve for future reviews. Thanks for the feedback! It's always helpful."
indiegames,3dn604,durrandi,2,Fri Jul 17 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"...I have a GTX970 video card. I absolutely should not be getting anything less than 60 on this game when I can run The Witcher 3 max settings at a constant 60fps.    Unless this game was running on the same engine as The Witcher 3, you cannot make these assumptions.  While I'm willing to bet that the game is probably just poorly optimized, you should have still checked out the other settings. You don't know what ultra means to the dev.   I'm an indie dev, and to me ""Ultra"" means I'm not going to bother optimizing it all. Full balls-to-the-wall render all the things hi res. ""Very-High"" is my max settings which are still optimized with reasonableness (no need to render hi-res if the thing is far away).  But that's just me. Other devs might keep Ultra optimized or not, there is no standard for what ""Ultra"" means.  I'm not trying to tear you apart. I thought all of your other points in the video were reasonable. Bad optimization can be a death knell for a game, and as a reviewer, you should do due diligence before declaring a game poorly optimized."

indiegames,3dhzhs,justmelee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:24:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input - don't worry, it's not discouraging! We did actually throw the demo together in a week or two (and weeks after that of just bug-fixing, you know how it is) and it's supposed to be a concept.  Most ideas that come from Kickstarter are just ideas - and we think ours is a good one but we believe that by having a playable demo we can really show people what our idea is instead of feebly trying to explain it in words.  Perhaps the video wasn't the best showcase of the game - everything that we wanted to say is split between 7 or 8 episodes, so it's probably hard to see where we're coming from. Should've thought that through really, hahah. Do you have any suggestions for a better way to show you how we see the game?"

indiegames,3dcrbc,Cogh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:04:30 2015 UTC,"quite stressful haha  On the art side, we had a super small team;  1 concept artist  1 3D artist (myself)  1 Animator  So it was a lot to do for a few people, it took us around 2 years (with pre-prod) to get where the game is today, and we're still working hard on it.  I'm not a tech guy, but the devs put a lot of work in to the real-time multiplayer aspect of the game.  On launch, we actually got featured on the front page of the IOS app store (main banner in China), but we had some serious network issues in the first week, and this killed our retention rate, most of those issues are fixed now, but obviously without the feature anymore, we aren't getting the download numbers that would be ideal.  We're still learning (even though most of us have many years of industry experience), and we learnt a lot from our first launch title. In terms of a good game, I think we succeeded, but we need to work more on monetization.  Thanks for taking a look, any further questions ask away!"

indiegames,3dai0p,TheRedOne24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:39:32 2015 UTC,"The game tells the story of a sphere trapped in a cubes' dictatorship.  The gameplay is a mix of stealth and puzzle, organized in two phases: In the first one you're in a top-viewed isometric 3D vision where you can plan the strategy, placing elements and modifying the entire scenario; then you're in a third person view where you can play as the Sphere, running and escaping through the levels you have modified a few moments before, using elements and power-ups placed during the planning phase"
indiegames,3d7lut,ChaseTSG,2,Tue Jul 14 03:34:06 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in the game, but I have a question- what plans, if any, do you have for the future involving this game? Do you have a website I can check out? Edit: found the site on the greenlight page, pardon my ignorance"
indiegames,3d7lut,MetalManII,2,Tue Jul 14 08:41:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your interest in the game! I am glad you found the link to the site. As for the future involving the game I probably dont have as much out in the open as I should so I am glad you brought that to my attention.  I have a lot of ideas and things that I want to do with the game but I also would like to see how the community would like to play Beneath Us. Currently I look at having to balance 3 main aspects of the game which are PVE, PVP, and regular survival. Regular survival I dont consider with PVE and will be the lowest in importance because I feel it is the least fun to the players. Also there are enough games out there that do regular survival (food, water, etc.) very well. So then there is PVP, this I consider to be at a high level of importance to me but at the same time is hard to judge because I am not sure how people will play the game. If people are joining others servers to play and have fun then I would like to put most of my focus on PVP however more than likely my game will have a very small player base which is why most of my focus and the highest level of importance will be on PVE. Once my game reaches a balance that I think is very fun and enjoyable and I considered to be a polished game I will release it. But I am hoping that will only be the beginning for Beneath Us because from there I plan to change and rebalance those big 3 things using community feedback and by also looking at how players are playing the game and what they enjoy the most.  I am not sure if this is the answer you're looking for and I could go on forever talking about the game but I have already left you a wall of text haha. Feel free to ask if you have any other questions or would like to hear anything else in more specific detail."

indiegames,3d6jq3,ericdrobinson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:36:32 2015 UTC,"The good: The outside level design is interesting and has potential. I have always liked fireflies especially since they tend to symbolize illumination and the short lived nature of things. The lighting is just dark enough and adds to the general atmosphere.  The bad: The inside level design isn't very good. In a horror game the environment plays as much a part in the narrative as characters and monsters do. What are your houses trying to say about what happened there? There are somethings knocked over but not others. There's blood behind bookcases but the narrative of the house is so jumbled its hard to tell if that's on purpose or just an oversight. When your players walk into the houses you should have them feel a sense of anticipation. That's where the scariness comes in. And last, that looping wind sound needs to go. Its fine-ish for outside but the constant whooooosh isn't scary its just annoying."
indiegames,3d6jq3,mojoconcarne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:27:09 2015 UTC,"Looping wind sound has been removed. Currently the houses are all empty and dull. The only thing the player can do is pick up books and throw them around. We want the player to find notes in these buildings, those notes were his grandfathers diary, and he wants you to gather them and publish his diary as his ultimate work. We will try to figure out something interesting to happen in some houses. Thanks for the feedback."

indiegames,3d4to2,Jess_GA,3,Mon Jul 13 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"Took the survey, got a few feedback points for you:   Professionalism matters, especially when it impacts the clarity of your question design. ""n00b"" and ""pr0"" are not professional ways to describe levels of expertise. If you want people to take your survey seriously, take your own survey design seriously.  There was nothing to differentiate targeted platforms. This is important, as mobile development is different from desktop development which is different from console development which is different from tabletop development. You have no way of knowing which ecosystem someone's answers apply to.  As a result of the last point, many questions are irrelevant. I don't use in-game metrics, for instance, because all of my games are tabletop. There are no options for ""not applicable"" and no prompts saying whether or not your should answer something if it's not applicable.  What's the goal of the survey? You should mention that somewhere. Gamasutra does an annual survey that's far more detailed than yours, so what's stopping you from using their data? Why is your survey, specifically, necessary or important and what do your participants have to gain from answering your questions? Are they contributing to science or are they helping you gather free data to improve your paid services?"
indiegames,3d4to2,rxninja,2,Mon Jul 13 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"Agree with /u/rxninja the n00b/pr0 should go.  Q 7 ""how big is your team"" the first answer ""just me"" and the second answer ""1-2"" appear to overlap at ""1"".  Q 14 the regions list seems quite limited  Q 25 ""How much value do you place on data?"" That's quite ambiguous  Q 29 Is a yes/no plus value question in one.  It needs another answer ""Not applicable""  Q 40 ""You know nothing, John Snow."" is confusing  I stopped at that point, because I answered a decent amount of questions but didn't know if I was 10% done or 80% done.

Desura disaster, family sick, forced travel, heatwave, I got sick but finally I did it!  Check it out here!  So .. why am I doing a Kickstarter for a game that's already in the making?  It's all about looks actually (well almost). The graphics are kind of amateurish sometimes. cough  So I'm doing this Crowd Funding to fix exactly that, beautiful graphics are expensive!  Also there are no music in the game yet, I'd love not having to use some free old classic music for everything but some new exclusive stuff for the game, music that fits to the theme, music that was created for this special ambience, so that's the second part of the main goal!  So please think about donating some bucks or buy access to the game and more (Link)!

indiegames,3cxq06,void143,3,Sat Jul 11 18:43:59 2015 UTC,Hey man it's too bad to hear about your game. It looks well polished and done but it seems you forgot about one thing: market research... Who were you wanting to buy this and who is looking for it? How would they find it? How many people are searching for mouse games and if you search mouse how many results are there? 100? 1000? You sound like a pretty smart guy but I see this all the time you have a good idea but you don't bother to check the current market. The App Store is a cluster fuck if you are not unique you won't find downloads no matter how good your app is.   If I had that type of money to play around with I would kill it just because I know the demand of the App Store. I'm not saying my games are great but with little to no budget I'm consistently in the top 150 of my category even a year in. Hit me up in a message if you are still interested in making games and would like some advice on the actual store or would like to team up in some way id love a backer and have the portfolio to prove myself.
indiegames,3cxq06,TouchMint,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the good word.  What is your personal suggestion if you were me? Invest more in ambition to increase/create market for mouse game, or step back and start over with proper market approach?"
indiegames,3cxq06,TouchMint,2,Sat Jul 11 20:04:20 2015 UTC,Honestly the App Store and especially game market is so full it's very hard to get noticed unless you approach a high demand market with low supply. You have the polish in your game and it seems pretty fun but no one is going to find it when there are a million other games out there and mouse isn't a really popular trend to be searching. I wouldn't suggest just blindingly picking a category to jump on without really taking a look around.   I created some rpg rogue like games called adventure to fate and they do well because the demand is there and the market is not totally over saturated. another great thing about the market is that it's a little bit of an older demographic so people will actually pay for the games. You have mouse game that mostly kids will look at yet it's paid so that's a pretty big problem. Kids don't have money and there are tons of other free ones out there so it's just not a good combo.
indiegames,3cxq06,zoolius,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:33:10 2015 UTC,"hey, i made a few games recently myself and would certainly like your  opinion on them if you could!   do you do this for a living or on the side?  i didnt spend any money on promotion yet which led me to very low downloads, i think the games are good but zero visibility and im always looking to understand the market better :)  my games are fully free with no IAP at the moment as i wanted to see if i would get installs first"

I have an android so I can't really view the game but one thing to remember on mobile development is - generally speaking - there a 100 different free versions of your game already on the market so you need something really cool to get them to pay for yours.

To be honest even after watching the game play I still have no idea what the game is or what it's about. The art looks intriguing enough that if I were to see it on the app store or google play store I would download it and try it but I wouldnt spend money just to try it out. People are really stingy when it comes to spending money on apps vs spending money on other platforms.
indiegames,3cxq06,Hexjackal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:13:12 2015 UTC,It's for all devices capable to run iOS 6.0 and further. I've got the idea to provide more thorough longer playback video in app description in order to catch the gameplay idea and mechanics

indiegames,3ct8yw,airmanf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:29:15 2015 UTC,I think Square Enix Collective is a cool initiative that speaks well to the company. What stage of development do you recommend games to be in before submitting?
indiegames,3ct8yw,RikuKat,2,Fri Jul 10 21:10:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for support! Sorry about the massive reply that follows... hope it all makes sense!   If we look at it strictly from a stage of development point of view, you generally should try and have as much of the game fundamentals and mechanics in a presentable state. It's not expected that your pitch includes a demo (few pitches do) but you should at least be able to provide screenshots or even a trailer that can showcase the particular mechanic or part of the game you're currently talking about in the pitch.   Readers will probably be a lot more interested in a game when they have screenshots to break up the text and help visualize what's going on (.gifs also work wonders). Think as screenshots as the tl;dr option. A lot of people go for tl;drs.   I would think that submitting a pitch that only contains concept art without any proof of the actual game's existence would be too early. You want to have something to be able to show people and say 'This is what my game will look like...' rather than show them practically nothing and have to say 'I hope my game will be...'  So somewhere in between those two times basically. You want to have enough of a game to be able to prove to people what the game will be. Particularly in the current crowdfunding climate where people are less trusting after having been burned by high profile Kickstarter fails that promised the world but were unable to deliver.    I would say, once you have the mechanics of your game mapped out and can provide screenshots or footage of what the game will look like as well as what the key features of it will be (for example being able to showcase a bit of a combat system for an RPG) you're in a pretty good place to submit.   Now looking at timings from a different angle, I reckon that you should submit your project to Collective some months before you plan to launch your crowdfunding campaign.   The Collective feedback phase lasts for 28 days after which the decision is made whether Square Enix can support you through a crowdfunding phase (only should you wish to continue on with SE support). However, before any crowdfunding campaign can take place, the team assessment must be completed - this may take a few weeks depending on how quickly the assessment can be organised as our own developers are also kept quite busy with their own SE games.  On top of that, Collective generally has a queue built up for projects that we may support through crowdfunding as it's not possible for us to support more than one game through crowdfunding at a time right now. So even if the team assessment is completed with all due speed, it's possible there might still be a queue. We'd of course let you know well in advance when a potential window for you would be so you can plan accordingly.   Furthermore, the short 'interlude' between the end of your feedback phase and any crowdfunding plans you might have (whether they include Collective or not) is very useful for you too. It gives you time to review both your game and your pitch. Figure out what people liked or didn't like/understand. Think about whether you feel that people who read your pitch on Collective fully understood your vision - if they didn't, chances are people on Kickstarter won't either..!  So all that being said, I'd suggest a few months before the launch of any crowdfunding campaigns. Working on a very tight timetable may not work out for the best if it means you can't make the most of the feedback provided.    Sorry about the massive reply, there's no exact answer to such a question unfortunately!"

indiegames,3cs3ad,bluebirdplays,2,Fri Jul 10 12:51:45 2015 UTC,"Looks maybe interesting, but I'd recommend doing a SERIOUS rewrite of the description, it is very clear that English is not your first language and it's not very well written.  I'd maybe change the text:   “The Warden” is a first-person psychological-horror game with puzzles . Ephram Elias Barkley is a landowner who , after losing his family , lives his life in a alcoholic loneliness . His life is interspersed with moments of lucidity and states of trance that seem to leave, as only trace, mysterious drawings of dark landscapes in which stands a big figure with deers horns…  ""Was always the same picture... a landscape with a river and a forest. The only difference was that the black figure seemed to be getting closer. Each time it was as if it had been drawed closer. Its outlines became lighter, and I glimpsed some horns, that I thought looked like deer's horns, on its head... From then on my memories fade and my mind starts to waver.""   To maybe something like this:   “The Warden” is a first-person psychological-horror game with puzzles. Ephram Elias Barkley is a landowner who, after THE TRAGIC LOSS OF HIS family, WASTES HIS DAYS IN A LONELY, ALCOHOL FUELED, DAZE.  IN HIS INFREQUENT MOMENTS OF LUCIDITY, HE WAKES TO FIND MYSTERIOUS DRAWINGS OF DARK LANDSCAPES. A DARK FIGURE. HORNS.  ""THE DRAWINGS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME... A RIVER. A FOREST. ONLY ONE THING EVERY CHANGES. CLOSER, ALWAYS CLOSER.  JUST AS IT SEEMS I CAN SEE THE HORNS, MY MEMORY FADES AND MY MIND WAVERS.   Or something like that.  Just a suggestion (changes in caps)"

indiegames,3cnhqo,flabby__fabby,3,Thu Jul 9 07:28:56 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty robust, especially given how long it's been in development! While the art does leave a bit to be desired it has a certain charm to it, and the music definitely helps. Overall it appears to have a strong ""epic"" / ""brain melt-y"" vibe which seems to work really well with the genre. Best of luck getting greenlit! :)"
indiegames,3cnhqo,LTPATS,2,Thu Jul 9 07:51:54 2015 UTC,It's not something I would play myself but for a first go and 6 weeks development you've done a great job. There seems to be a lot of variety to the enemies and it looks like mad fun. I'm more of a slower paced gamer. Broforce would be my limit in terms of crazy fast paced gaming. I'll give you a vote anyways though. Good luck.

indiegames,3cmom0,CogMonocle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:33:25 2015 UTC,"The object of this game is to accumulate mass by colliding with smaller objects, and avoiding larger ones. What makes this game different is that the only way you can move is pressing and holding on planets to activate their gravity, or, once every several seconds, you can get a quick burst of speed in any direction by swiping. The game ends when you get sucked in by a black hole.  Me and a few other students have been working with the Entrepreneurial Games Studio at Drexel University to produce this game over the past year or so. We've made a couple games together but this is the first we've put to market - any feedback is appreciated, as we're moving on to our next project soon!

I found the video to be a little tedious. Under normal circumstances I wouldn't have watched it to the end. It takes a little too long to get to the gameplay. All in all I think it was a little too long for the amount of (exciting) content. For example: Do you need to show the Unity logo? Is it necessary to show the amazing animations as long as you did (I got the joke right when I read it)? ...  The fonts were all over the place, which made it look unprofessional. Especially the part were you put text above the title explaining that it's just a working title.  Also what's up with the black borders? How did you manage to get black borders on all sides of the video? ;D"

indiegames,3cgbdb,SuddenlyNinja_YT,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:11:02 2015 UTC,"What's up everyone!   This week I had a look at Poly Bridge, the highly acclaimed cartoony bridge building simulator by developer Dry Cactus, available on Steam.  Poly Bridge is a fairly simplistic bridge building game that sets the player an easy task: build a bridge and have several different motor-vehicles pass over it safely. Sometimes the game throws in an extra obstacle, like a boat that needs to pass under the bridge, so players have to build a drawbridge to let the boat through.  The first few levels seem fairly simple, but the game ramps up the difficulty fairly quickly,. You go from simple 1 level straight bridges to suspensionbridges with a drawbridge in the middle in a matter of minutes, and it's only a matter of time until you're scratching your head, looking for a way to prevent your bridge from shattering and tumbling into the river."

indiegames,3cfaax,Norgg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:38:52 2015 UTC,How much of a difference does being in a sphere instead of a plane make?
indiegames,3cfaax,Sans-Culotte,2,Tue Jul 7 15:24:38 2015 UTC,"Dev here.  A key part of the gameplay is looking around the sphere you're currently in, and keeping track of where the other objects are, their velocity - and your own ship of course.  The video doesn't really show looking around very much, but it's a big part of the game.  And it works in VR too :)"
indiegames,3cfaax,slow_riot,2,Tue Jul 7 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"To add to that: Geometrically, the wrapped plane from Asteroids is basically an unfolded torus, it means that something going in a straight line won't be back where it started after a single loop over the X or Y axis unless it's at a multiple of 90 degrees, on a sphere anything travelling in a straight line (great circle really) will end up back where it started."
indiegames,3cfaax,slow_riot,2,Tue Jul 7 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"Yep indeed, another interesting effect is that there are no parallel paths, unlike in asteroids; in fact any two objects that are continuing under their own momentum without acceleration in the sphere will have their paths crossing twice.  One of the upshots of which is that pretty much any two objects travelling at a different speed to each other will eventually collide if left to their own devices... now the rocks themselves pass through each other (like in asteroids) but some bullets continue flying for a long time, so the results can be interesting."

I want to get people's attention through internet (through the web) and then get them to download it on their phones if they liked the game and think it is worth the price and they enjoyed it.  Not everyone who tried the game liked being put their abilities/skills to test as this game does. This is not a game for everyone I would say.

Checkpoints would be nice if the maps get a lot longer than that. Also the spammability of the attack made it trivial(Some kind of cooldown might help).

'You're' is a contraction of 'you are'. So you are trying to say ""Show you are mighty"". 'Your' is possessive as in, your hamster, your app, show your Mum you're mighty.  A few other corrections shown in bold:  The hamster is floating in the ocean and he is very very mighty. Join this fun adventure and help the crazy hamster to come out. But be careful, because the marine world has a lot of surprises and dangers!  Features:   Big beautiful underwater world with many exciting dangerous levels. A great variety of superpowers that help you get higher. Many different, unique platforms. A big mighty hamster punch :)   Hope this helps. I might have a look at the game later."

indiegames,3bwmks,Rebelian,2,Fri Jul 3 05:53:29 2015 UTC,"It's a cute little game but I have some issues.  It says it's optimised for iPad but it's not, it doesn't even show up on the iPad section of the store so I ran the iPhone version which was very low res and the top of the screen was cut off. I don't have an iPhone.  There needs to be a better tutorial at the beginning. I didn't realise you had to tilt to move.  Just touching a platform made me pop up on it which was confusing and made me hit some enemies I didn't think I would.  Failing brings up a screen saying Oops you did it. This doesn't really make sense. Maybe change it to Oops, try again!  And you'll want to change the part in the beginning that says ""Show Your Mighty"" to ""Show You're Mighty"" otherwise it doesn't make sense - show my mighty? English is stupid huh?  Sorry for all the negatives but we're all trying to do better here. The positives were the hamster is cute, the artwork is nice although pixelated on the iPad and I liked the music. So congratulations to you and your girlfriend on your first game, I hope it goes well for you both."

We have been employing an open development model, and our progress has been tracked on Sam's blog AMIndieDev.

indiegames,3bmpfy,murkwork,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:46:13 2015 UTC,"Love what you're doing, game looks awesome. Thought it was worth mentioning however, offering an alpha as ""free"" is probably not the best was to phrase that. Like, it would be pretty brash of a developer to charge people to playtest their alpha builds, it's assumed it'd be free.  If anything, you should try to incentivize people to playtest the alpha; you want that player feedback and it'd help build playerbase/get the word out. Doesn't have to be monetary or anything, just food for thought."

I wanted people to play it and free seemed to be something important to tell people, but I wanted to express that it was in an alpha state.  Thanks for the advice on changing it.    As incentive goes, we have been discussing that.  Maybe some exclusive content or something for early supporters.  We are trying to get ready for a submission to SIX (Seattle Indies Expo) and wanted to get some exposure.  After our SIX submission I'll be free from creating art assets and can focus on making more promotional materials and a website.

An important factor was the limitation of the artist, he knows very well 2d art and not so much 3d and this is the perfect method for those who don't know 3d well. We were able to get away with this becouse of the top-down view showing very little of the sides of the ships. Also, we wanted the game to be extremely light and to be able to run in a microwave and we almost achieved that!"
indiegames,3baeui,Merosi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"thanks for the explanation, i think given the limitations that's a good solution."

I loved the beach scenario and the competition with my friends (up to 8 players). Inspired in this game, I started to develop the ""Carioca Games"" The idea is to bring the classic mini games to mobile with Rio de Janeiro as the main scenario. The first mini-game, Kick Ups, is an adaptation of Footbag. I put the beta in the Play Store for testing, but I am still working on new moves, features and challenges.  I would like your opinion about the gameplay and any suggestions to continue the development of the game."

indiegames,3b35uj,Leighner,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"I think asking people to check out your game is a right place, right time kind of situation.  Lots of YouTubers are very particular with the content they feature on their channel.  Pretty much any YouTuber would be willing to check a new game out.  Whether or not they'll want to make a video of it is another story.  :)    That being said, asking people to check out your game can go a long way!  For instance, take a look at what the devs for ARK: Survival Evolved did...  They sent out tons of steam keys to streamer/youtuber communities to check out.  It turns out they had an amazingly fun game and now it's one of the most streamed games out there!    As for trying out your game, we've been looking to start a smaller series playing indie games on our channel for a while now.  Is your game multiplayer at all or is it just SP?  Either way, all the best to you and your game!"

indiegames,3b11mw,virtuousboy,2,Thu Jun 25 06:59:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe your homescreen could look more like this?:  http://i.imgur.com/NB80mA7.jpg  The redesign is less cluttered and the visual hierarchy is clearer.  I removed the rating button as you should choosing who you want to rate and asking them to via a dialog. Prompt a user to rate after they've shown to play a significant amount of time. You want your biggest fans rating, not just anyone. This will improve your rating. You want higher ratings, not more ratings.  Are you getting significant ad revenue from that banner at the bottom? It really detracts a lot more than the transition ads do.  The bomb button is hard to reach. Does it cause problems with swiping if you put it in the bottom right?  Don't put the ad after a play, put it before a play. I'm less likely to exit the app that way.  Your game over screen needed some work as well so I hope you don't mind: http://i.imgur.com/Iyvv7Tq.jpg  The message when sharing with a friend should say ""Can you beat [last score] in #SplashyFroggyFish?

A hard working citizen and a family man. Hello Ted! Don't be shy! Wait a minute... what's that sound? Oh no! It's the nuclear bomb alarm! Not to worry, Ted knows what to do! The government's superb early warning system gives Ted 60 seconds to take cover in the fallout shelter under his house.

indiegames,3aqceq,Vira1969,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:34:12 2015 UTC,"Stanley Parable!  I would also recommend these: Cave Story, Super Meat Boy, Towerfall and Nidhogg (if you have friends), Duck Game (haven't played but looks great), Risk of Rain, Terraria, Hotline Miami, Binding of Isaac"
indiegames,3ap2r2,TheViIIager,3,Mon Jun 22 10:08:53 2015 UTC,"It's so great to see them able to bounce back after the nasty Kickstarter crap.  The game looks fantastic!  We're currently working on Galacide, a shoot-em-up combined with a match-4 puzzler. If Dimension Drive is up your alley, then give Galacide a look-see: http://store.steampowered.com/app/356790/  We're working on adding another ship and another boss to the game currently, so be on the lookout for that as well.  Really great to see Dimension Drive succeeding, and I can't wait to play!"

indiegames,3aom2e,Anamik,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:00:05 2015 UTC,"What's the plot?  Also, the game has very low fps in your trailer. Generally not a good look."
indiegames,3aom2e,Nesfero,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:22:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's true. The low fps is due to the screen recorder but not the game. The game runs smoothly. If you wish you can watch the review done by an Youtuber. You will find the difference, watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MB1IvhAqZw"
indiegames,3am5x1,crea-tureStudios,8,Sun Jun 21 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"Oooh, this looks cool.  So is it like the Skate games, or are you the camera man?"
indiegames,3am5x1,Dragon1Freak,5,Sun Jun 21 16:52:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback, right now, we are not focusing on playing the camera guy but it is absolutely something we have on the roadmap and to answer your question, yes we are closer to skate. than thps for sure but we go couple steps closer to what we think skateboarding is!  cheers!"
indiegames,3am5x1,JDBar1215,3,Sun Jun 21 17:54:16 2015 UTC,If this is anything like the quality of Skate it's possibly an instant-buy for me. I don't have a PS3 anymore and I've been starving for a skateboarding game that's similar.
indiegames,3am5x1,PENIS-PENIS,5,Sun Jun 21 21:29:41 2015 UTC,PC desperately needs more good skate games!
indiegames,3am5x1,CougarForLife,3,Sun Jun 21 20:33:26 2015 UTC,haha you weren't kidding when you called it a teaser. very intrigued though. there's an ongoing missed opportunity in the skating game space since skate ended. love seeing that you guys are trying to fill that. got a Twitter or something where we can follow development progress?
indiegames,3am5x1,Red-Blue-,2,Sun Jun 21 22:22:02 2015 UTC,"Is this full on simulator, or half sim and half arcade style?"
indiegames,3am5x1,bulletfever409,2,Sun Jun 21 22:47:40 2015 UTC,is this game going to control and play like skate? and this will be a game I'll definitely be buying as the closest to a skate game i've played on PC is shaun whites skateboarding. I'm really excited for this!
indiegames,3am5x1,aroymart,2,Sun Jun 21 23:32:47 2015 UTC,"thanks for all the good feedback, yes it is quite a tease but it contains lot more than you may note at first glance;) I'll try to answer as much as without spoiling too much. Our first platform to hit is definitely PC. we are PC gamers we believe in that community and there should be more to pc games than it gets! but you will need a controller for sure:P   We are not going on the same route as tony hawk at all! this should give you another clue ;)   You can follow us on twitter @actionofcreate facebook/actionofcreate as well and our website will soon be up and running! www.crea-turestudios.com   thanks again, cheers!   -mAh"
indiegames,3am5x1,siriushours,2,Mon Jun 22 00:01:50 2015 UTC,"Hey dude! Awesome game, I've been waiting for a good pc skating game for the longest, and I am stoked to try this game out.  Just a tip, when someone comments to you, you can hit ""reply"" from your inbox, or if you see their comment on your post the reply button is on the bottom right of their comment."
indiegames,3am5x1,siriushours,2,Mon Jun 22 02:58:06 2015 UTC,haha good point! :) thanks for pointing that out!

indiegames,3am5x1,bmynameislexie,2,Tue Jun 23 01:02:23 2015 UTC,Whoa! I really hope that they can succeed with this. The world needs a new skating game. I'm almost (key word) getting tired of playing the Skate games. Can't wait to see more!
indiegames,3am5x1,er1end,3,Tue Jun 23 22:48:24 2015 UTC,"thanks, we will try our bet to succeed but you guys will have a chance to help us doing so in august when we'll launch our likkle kickstarter! :)"
indiegames,3am5x1,siriushours,3,Wed Jun 24 12:54:39 2015 UTC,"Fantastic, I'll be sure to check it out and spread the word!"

indiegames,3amopy,oranjuiced,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:00:50 2015 UTC,I love this game!  I'm inspired by what you did with such a simple concept and took it this ahead with a great amount of imagination. I hope to make a game like this in the future.  btw how did you go about creating levels?
indiegames,3anju2,mwes8945,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:37:08 2015 UTC,"I just downloaded it, it's really fun. Great job on the gameplay it's simple and clever. Love the little detail like the grass animation and the contrast between your monk and the belt he is wearing. I will definitely be recommending this to my friends."
indiegames,3anju2,ThePatrioticChicken,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:37:48 2015 UTC,Thank so much for the feedback and sharing with friends. Glad you like it!
indiegames,3amqdf,Aserash,2,Sun Jun 21 19:14:46 2015 UTC,I can do the german translation for the play store page if ya want to
indiegames,3amqdf,Clyybber,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:03:46 2015 UTC,That would be much appreciated. Give me a PM and we'll discuss.
indiegames,3akfv8,antonio07c,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:59:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not on Google Play - do you plan on doing an iOS, APK/Ouya/AndroidTV or PC release? Any other platforms planned? I'd love to try it but I get that I'm in the minority as far as platforms go.  Were you aware of the 1995 Platformer of a similar name?: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_Boy"
indiegames,3akfv8,dWillPrevail,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:15:38 2015 UTC,"Hi dWillPrevail, yes, I submitted the iOS version a week ago, I'm just waiting for them to approve it, I will let you know when it's live.  I had never heard about the 1995 game, but the concept with my game is different."
indiegames,3akfv8,dWillPrevail,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:30:15 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'll keep an eye out for it, It looks cool.  As for the '95 game, be cautious that you're not using an existing trademark, a mistake there could land you on the wrong side of a lawsuit.   All the best."
indiegames,3aidbf,Snowysgaming,0,Sat Jun 20 13:53:55 2015 UTC,"Not that this doesn't look great, but it's a shame the combat isn't more involved. Imagine if it were a beat'em up."
indiegames,3aicuf,bubman,3,Sat Jun 20 13:48:12 2015 UTC,Well from the look of the images it looks like an interesting game you have my greenlight vote. And I can't wait till its out.
