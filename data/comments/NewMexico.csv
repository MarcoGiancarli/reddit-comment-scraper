Look up the midnight dune hikes - I know there is one the last Saturday of September but you have to go online and register 2 weeks in advance and they fill up fast.  Would be something different to do at White Sands since you have been there a few times already.   There's a pretty good Thai Restaurant in Alamo. Other than that... there's not a whole lot. There is a good Mexican place, can't remember what it's called but it's right outside of town on the road to White Sands.   Honestly hit up some food trucks if you can find them.

They are slightly unusual among the Hemiptera because almost all are terrestrial ambush predators (most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic). The main examples of non-predatory Reduviidae are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae. Though there are spectacular exceptions, most members of the family are fairly easily recognisable: they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build and formidable curved proboscis (sometimes called a rostrum). Large specimens should be handled with caution, if at all, because they sometimes defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see.

NewMexico,3aov0v,jwhwv24,37,Mon Jun 22 08:05:32 2015 UTC,"I grew up on I-40 so to speak. The town I lived in, Gallup, is stretched along it for 20 miles, but only has ~20,000 inhabitants.   Out here, anything you need to do involves driving, and usually lots of it. What you saw from Albuquerque west is true beyond your immediate vicinity: miles and miles of arid high desert with sandstone bluffs, interrupted by the occasional juniper or piñon or pine forest and the even rarer lake.  The communities tend to be very close knit. You know quite a few people and their families. You also tend to have quite a bit of family in your town as well. In Gallup, a bunch of the people I went to school with were cousins, etc. Their extended families were pretty big. Catholicism is the major religion here, but there are many types of Christianity present as well as a sizable Muslim minority in Gallup/Albuquerque. Interestingly, a few Arab friends of mine said the climate is similar to their homelands. Many are Saudis or Jordanians.  As far as the rural goes, you get this sense that you are alone. You may have neighbors, but beyond them could easily be miles of complete wilderness. It's big sky here, so that only adds to the effect. Life in the rural parts is hard too. Gallup wasn't rural, just small, but the very rural required a lot of work. They are strong independent people, but like anywhere it takes all types. To live in the rural, or to live well you have to be very self reliant.  I think the local cuisine is the most interesting part. It is called New Mexican, and in my opinion the best forms of this style are found in Gallup, Albuquerque, and Santa Fe. It is based around flour (corn or bleached wheat), cheese, beans, and most importantly green and red chile. Definitely worth a try.  The People: many of these people have families that have occupied this land for generations. This includes the New Mexicans, the Pueblos, and the non-Pueblo Indians like the Navajo, as well as American settlers. It is starting to mix up more in Albuquerque and Santa Fe, but the smaller towns have stayed similar. By the way, these communities aren't strictly defined all the time. Just depends on where you are at. A lot of Katrina refugees also settled through out the state as well. I think it is pretty cool that Albuquerque has a relatively (by NM standards) large Vietnamese community. These are the people who either fled communism or supported the democracy.  One thing that is true among all the communities I have come across is an intense pride. Pride of heritage, pride of present. It might come across as off putting, but so long as you don't offend that pride no harm usually comes of it. A few years ago Gallup was named the most patriotic small town in America, so that pride takes many forms.  Beyond Gallup to the north and south is the eastern frontier of the largest Native American reservation in the United States. You drove right through it until around Sanders/St John, Arizona. Life on the Rez is even more isolated and that much harder. The land has its own beauty tho. The Native American culture here is certainly alive. Includes the Navajos, Pueblos, Apaches, and other tribes as well.  Wouldn't be fair to leave out the negative. As a border state, we are the poorest (and one of the poorest in general) and certainly get our fair share of drugs. In Albuquerque this means that heroin is common and has become a big problem among teenagers. State-wide, alcoholism is rampant in every community; in the town sense and heritage sense. Legalized Indian gambling is common as you saw. Hitch hiking is still a common form of transport for many. There is crushing poverty in certain areas. On a lighter note, I think sheep and cattle still outnumber people.    Ok, sorry for the wall of text. If there is a very specific aspect you are interested in, maybe I could try to find some sources for you to explore further."
NewMexico,3aov0v,jshepardo,5,Mon Jun 22 09:59:35 2015 UTC,Excellent description.
NewMexico,3aov0v,peachmagpie,12,Mon Jun 22 14:24:58 2015 UTC,The best food is southern New Mexican. So much flavor
NewMexico,3aov0v,DramaDramaLlama,8,Mon Jun 22 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"I'm from silver city in the southwest part of the state. There's definitely a lot of driving to be done in the south as well. It seems that towns are usually around an hour drive from each other. There's tons of small towns littered throughout southern New Mexico and they all have something to offer if you know what to look for. Silver City is a pretty nice place, it's often found on ""best small town"" lists. We're right on the edge of the Gila National Forest (which is the biggest forest in New Mexico and the United States' first wilderness area) which is absolutely beautiful. There's a couple lakes around the area as well as the vast ""emptiness"" of the high desert.  As for the culture, from what I've noticed there's is a stronger connection to Mexican culture here in the south (probably because of the proximity to the border.) The Native American culture is not as strong here as somewhere like Gallup but can still be found. I think we take our food pretty seriously in this state. If you're looking for the best NM food, (and I say this with extreme hometown bias) this area is where you want to be. If you're looking for chile there's no better place to go than Hatch. You can get it anywhere but Hatch is the ""Chile Capital of the World"" and the chile festival is coming up soon...that is a great experience for anyone new to the state. That being said if you do come to New Mexico you have to eat a green chile cheeseburger at Blakes Lotaburger. It's not the best thing you'll have but it'll definitely be an authentic New Mexican experience."

NewMexico,3aov0v,David_P_Ray_TorC_NM,7,Wed Jun 24 03:11:31 2015 UTC,"Southern New Mexican here (Lincoln County).  First, good job on noting that there is a difference between the northern and southern parts of the state. The culture of Northern New Mexico has more to do with where people are, which is generally near the rivers and mountains. Most all pueblos are located like that, as are ABQ and Santa Fe.  Further south you get more of a West Texas cattle culture (especially east of 285). We don't have any Pueblo peoples, we have Apaches (cousins to the Navajos of northwest NM). Whereas ABQ had trains and Santa Fe was the capital, and thus brought settlers and people, southern NM has always been kind of a no-man's land. The Apaches made life hard for any would-be settlers to the point that anything west of the Pecos River (Roswell) was considered lawless for a long time.  We're also closer to the border, and have a closer relationship with Mexico than our northern half both geographically and culturally. Although it's in Texas El Paso is a HUGE city, and plays a big part in southern New Mexican life.  Educationally, ABQ has UNM (and Santa Fe with liberal arts school St. John), down south there's NMSU (the ag school) and NM TECH (think, MIT in the desert).  A lot of people, when they visit New Mexico, they're headed to ABQ and Santa Fe. They're going to Angel Fire and Taos. It's touristy and for good reason: it's beautiful. If you find yourself in southern New Mexico, there's likely a more mundane reason (although we do have some beautiful areas!)"

NewMexico,3aov0v,Chingonjabe,3,Tue Jun 23 01:42:32 2015 UTC,"El Paso del Norte was a part of New Mexico during the Spanish colonial period as well as the Mexican period.  In fact Arizona, southern Colorado and western Texas were also considered part of New Mexico, but New Mexico was invaded by the U.S., so the U.S. set it's post War With Mexico borders.  Texas claimed all the land to the Rio Grande, which would of course include Albuquerque and Santa Fe.  My ancestors were among the founders of both villas, and none of them ever considered themselves anything but New Mexicans.  With the Compromise of 1850, Texas was given $10 million to stop claiming their western boundary was the Rio Grande, but some how they still ended up with El Paso."

The weather is often very windy or melt-your-face-off hot. And, like someone already said, schools aren't very good. We're also pretty up there in teen pregnancies.  That being said, I'm older and more mature now (hopefully) and I've seen a lot more of the country. Albuquerque is really not that bad. The mountains are beautiful. The food's great.

Space Museum in Alamogordo. Vally of Fires (newest US lava flow) near Carrizozo, NM.  White Sands (without saying). Carlsbad Caverns (without saying). Truth or Consequences for their amazing hot springs. (seriously worth checking out) Mountainaire, NM and its cool hotel plus the Pueblo Indian ruins not far from there.  La Borcita and La Luz canyons.  Las Cruces, NM (dripping springs, aguirre springs, plus WS Missile Range park/display) Simply driving down any and every road you feel like driving down because in NM almost everything is public land. If it isn't, there is a 99% chance it will be marked accordingly. Gates, as well, are open game if not locked or marked. Check your local BLM office for a map of the area. $4.00.

NewMexico,38o6va,MusicWithoutWords,2,Sat Jun 6 18:33:41 2015 UTC,"Text is a lot easier to read if paragraphs are short.    In November 2013, a couple friends and I went on a weeklong road trip where we would just find a spot each night to set camp and then hit the road again in the morning. We ended up getting to Taos as the sun was going down. We popped into Taos Ale house for a little while, had a few taco, a few drinks and chatted a bit with the bartender. When we were getting ready to leave, we asked said bartender if he could recommend anywhere close by where we could camp out for the night.  We got the usual “you know its cold out, and already dark… right?” but he ended up being very helpful and told us if we just drove south for a few miles we’d find a road near the water that is littered with campsites. Sure enough, we find the road, drive down the length of it, see plenty of empty camp areas, but end up driving back to the first one and start setting up. We’re a few days into our trip by now and have gotten very used to setting up quick after dark and being the only people camping out in the cold.  As we’re just about done getting the tent up, we see an older sedan drive past us (on the road that only takes you to other camp areas and then circles back. We find it a little weird that anyone other than us would be heading out to go camping when it’s this late and this cold (also a little weird to have a sedan on these dirt roads and not a truck or SUV, but not that weird I guess). A couple minutes pass, we’ve got camp all set and we’re debating staring a fire and staying up or just going straight to bed; then we see the sedan coming back up the road.  Then the sedan turns into our camp area… then it drives right up to us at our site. The car stops right next to us and the window rolls down. It’s really dark but I can see that there are 2 guys in the car. The guy in the drivers seat says “hey homies, you guys camping?” (imagine Jonah Hills cholo voice from 22 jump street type of deal). I reply, “um yeah, just finished setting up. About to go to bed”. He says “well whats up? Can we camp with you?”. “Well…. We’re about to go to sleep and we’ll be up real early”.  The guy in the driver seat looks at us, seems annoyed, leans out some and says “so we cant camp with you?” I say “I saw a bunch of people camped out over that way (I’m lying and I point to the other end of the camp area where it’s dark). And a couple other guys over that way who might still be up.” He leans back into the car, “okay homies”…. “you guys wanna shot”?  At his point it’s me and friend #1 standing next to the car talking while friend #2 is behind us in the truck and I already know he has a gun ready (he’s a master class competitive shooter). I say no thanks to the shot and good luck with camping out with one of the other nearby groups. The car drives off and we stay up a little late that night keeping an eye out. They didn’t come back. Maybe it was just some harmless drunk guys who were bored but it was a bit unnerving. Anyone else ever experience anything like this?"

NewMexico,38ggv1,Meginsanity,3,Thu Jun 4 02:22:01 2015 UTC,"I posted this on the /r/arizona crosspost but I'll put it here in case it helps anyone.   On Ancestry.com, I found a record for a Leonard Trujillo, born August 13, 1933, died June 2, 1969. He was in the Army around that time and Camp Drake was a joint Army/USAF base. He is buried in Santa Fe National Cemetery in New Mexico. Ancestry.com lists him as a Sgt.  Also the 1940 census has a ~5-year-old Leonard Trujillo living in Pena Blanca, Sandoval, New Mexico. That Leonard Trujillo is listed as Native American there.  I think 'watachi' is supposed to be 'watashi,' Japanese for 'private' or 'personal'.  Edit: In 1940, this Leonard Trujillo was living with a Ben Trujillo (44 years) and Gabriel Trujillo (9 years, born in 1931). Ben is listed as a widowed farmer. On July 5, 1952, a 21-year-old Gabriel Trujillo married Frances Taylor in San Francisco, CA. I think if they had kids, those would be the family to contact, as I don't see a marriage record for Leonard and he died relatively young."

People in ABQ grew up eating Blake's, so it has to be there, even though it sucks. Five Guys can't be on the list because it isn't local, even though it is plainly better than Blake's. People were pissed when Fuddruckers won best green chili cheeseburger in a blind taste test at the state fair last year, too.  Awards given out by local free papers and Albuquerque Magazine are the same way. People vote for the businesses they are loyal to, not the ones that really have the best food."

Late last year, I was informed that I would no longer be ""allowed"" to keep the BCBS plan I had been on for the past few years, which I considered very affordable. The cheapest plan I got to pick from for January 2015 on was nearly triple the premium, with another $1000 tacked on to the deductible.

A bit rocky last year in the very beginning because they were a new company, but I think they've more than made up for it (we actually had a premium decrease from last year to this year.  I think they are asking for a small increase next year, but nothing like the 51% BCBS wants - only 4-5%).  They're in the UNM network.  And their billing isn't a mess like Presbyterian's...."

If you want to make it more appealing the public transits in either area need to be better also.  25/26m is a pretty large gap to close though.

A flat spot of ground on an endless flat plain. There are mountains rising up on the horizon, but they are miles away. Here, at the site itself, there is hardly anything but people searching for a way to connect to a moment that occurred 70 years ago.   [...]  As we drive away, I am struck by how this “underwhelming” site can be so moving. Objectively, there is hardly anything to see, no interpretive center, no documentary film playing on an endless loop, none of the hand-holding, museum-style exhibits we associate with places of such import. Instead, the site is one of pilgrimage. And much like a religious pilgrimage, I think, its power comes from how it encourages us to internalize its meaning, to stand at a spot and consider the events of yesteryear that formed the world we now live in. To think about the things we take for granted, to ask questions about them, and to come up with our own answers.   image"

Sandia Mountains Tram - someone else mentioned this, and I second it. It's touristy, but the views are incredible. Padilla's Restaurant - a hole in the wall with very mild red and green chile that's safe (meaning not too hot) for tourists. The restaurant that CogitoNM mentioned in Old Town is Le Crepe Michele, a little French Cafe with good prices, yummy food, and a charming atmosphere. If you pass through Albuquerque on the first Friday of the month, check out Friday Fractals (google it) at the Natural History Museum on Friday evenings.  But buy your tickets early because they sell out...every single show since they've started. Bring hats, sunscreen, lip balm, and bottled water if you are going to be anywhere outside. have fun!"

Amazing place, great tour.  Food: Curious Kumquat, particularly if you're into what he does.  History: Santa Fe Plaza -- get a copy of Blood and Thunder and read en route, then take in SF with that fresh in mind.  Science: the VLA. Awe-inspiring and in a starkly beautiful place to boot.  Scenery: the Sandia Peak Tram. You get to see both sides of the mountain and the landscape for a hundred miles in 4 directions.  Refinement: the grounds and restaurant at Los Poblanos. Genteel and yet oh-so-New Mexican, nestled near the Rio Grande."

Santa Fe is great and White Sands is well worth a visit. The food is awesome but go easy on the chile, unless you always get extra spicy curry when you get Indian."
NewMexico,342ypa,HelenKellersJPEGS,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"Wow. I am very jealous. I can certainly say that NM has a LOT to offer. Blue Hole, Carlsbad Caverns (a must!), these caves (directions available upon request), Chaco Canyon, the Tram (in ABQ), and hiking through the Valles Caldera are all spectacular locations to go and see. Regarding restaurants I'd suggest Sadies, Garcias, and Padillas in Abq. Not sure about restaurants in SF, but if you drive through Madrid, NM (along N14 between Santa Fe and ABQ - awesome drive) there is a little restaurant called Mama Lisas that is ... just spectacular.  Old Town ABQ has what I call 'Rubber Tomahawk stores' - AKA Tourist Traps, but awesome nonetheless. There is a great restaurant down there, but forget the name. It's got a tree growing through the roof. If you visit the church down there, and look closely, you can see evidence of Crypto-Jews and the work they did to build this chapel. NM is a land with many thousands of years of history. The Pueblos, and their revolt, the Spanish, and their rape and pillaging of the land. Gold and Silver that has been the cause of thousands of deaths (some of which is still stashed in caches left behind by the Spanish), Turquoise that is so awesome that it's been placed in Incan Death Masks and Spanish Crown Jewels.   Last, but not least, and probably the most awesome. Drive from Quemado, NM north on I36 to I40 sometime during the late afternoon / early evening and you will be blessed with one of the MOST SPECTACULAR DRIVES you will ever see. It's called El Malpais, the Badland, and ... it's just amazingly beautiful. Multicolored banded mesas interspersed with some of the roughest and toughest land you'll ever tread upon. New boots will be trashed in a day, maybe less. But... it's just gorgeous. If you are going to go see the VLA (Very Large Array) you can take this road back to I40.   I could go on and on, but it's late. When you come through, let us know and we'll give more suggestions I'm sure. If you want some guides I know some of us here would be more than happy to provide that service. It's not often that we can show off the beautiful places in NM."

The term crypto-Jew is also used to describe descendants who maintain some Jewish traditions of their ancestors while publicly adhering to other faiths. The term is especially applied historically to European Jews who—outwardly or forcedly—professed Catholicism,      also known as Anusim or Marrano.

However, if it's something you never do you might not be ready for the whole 'sleeping on a pad on the ground' thing. It's great, but takes a bit of getting used to. That and you'd be looking at a few hundred dollars worth of gear unless you rough it with blankets, pads and pillows curled up on the ground. Something I've done literally hundreds of times. Waking up in the woods is a great experience, cooking breakfast on a fire is a skill that needs a bit of practice, and the lack of showers is something you need to ... accept. Nearby streams make for nice bath spots though."

When you're done they have a smaller pool nearby that you can rinse off in, or an open shower nearby.  It's fun and it feels good, but maybe not what you had in mind!"
NewMexico,33i4k2,stevekochscience,3,Wed Apr 22 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"Yes mud pool is seasonal, and subject to being closed anyway. Done it once, and was a lot of fun, ignoring any purported mystical powers of the mud. It's expensive, but I enjoy the premium rooms for: wood-burning fireplace (seasonal, my favorite part), a back patio with hot water tub for star gazing, and semi-private 'Kiva' pool. I'd be disappointed if I went there for natural mineral springs with healing powers. But I don't. The expensive rooms ($250 ?) are nice, and overall there are many peaceful hot tubs of various temperatures. I like the sauna too. We stop in Santa Fe and bring our own food, as the restaurant wasn't excellent. If you're expecting ""natural"" hot springs, Ojo is not for you. They use plumbing to make it a practical resort, which is fine by me, but would ruin it, I'd think, for those seeking hidden natural hot springs. Also: a big plus for me is there is little sulfur in Ojo, so there is no unpleasant smell like, say Pagosa. For all I know, they heat the water with electricity, but regardless, it's pleasant. That's my city-boy take."
NewMexico,33i4k2,Gigedoir,4,Thu Apr 23 07:11:32 2015 UTC,"Ojo is a fun trip, but you might find yourself getting tired of the same few pools. It's pretty laughable when they walk around with the ""quiet please"" signs which no one really pays attention to. Their food is excellent though. Make sure you try the tres leches for dessert.  If you think you might have the time, look into Pagosa Springs. They have a lot more pools, the San Juan River, and good food in the area. Definitely worth the drive."

NewMexico,33hf4p,Morgothic,2,Wed Apr 22 23:35:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. Came here to say this is a pretty stupid article/list and whoever wrote it didn't do much research on the bugs they listed.  First, the two spiders aren't technically bugs, but we can look past that.   The tarantula is completely harmless. Unless you're alergic, a bite from one is roughly the same as an ant bite or bee sting. There's some minor swelling and pain, but nothing you would even need to see a doctor for.  The recluse isn't actually a brown recluse, they live exclusively in the south east U.S. with their range stretching into central Texas. Ours is the Apache Recluse, which is a cousin to the Brown and is nearly identical, but still a different species. Having found them pretty regularly in my house, I've done a lot of research on them and the general consensus on them is that they really only bite when trapped against the skin, they'd much prefer to run away and hide.  The tarantula wasp/hawk doesn't eat tarantulas in the form shown in the picture, it lays it's eggs inside tarantulas and the babies eat their way out when they hatch.   At least half of the bugs on that list I have never encountered and I have lived in New Mexico all my life.  I am kind of surprised they didn't include any of the 3 species of scorpion that are native to the state, black widows, centipedes or the sun spider/wind scorpion/whatever name you know it by"

The drive twenty or so miles outside of town is beautiful as well to arrive at Whites Peak (?) I think.  Prehistoric Trackways Nat Park - the newest national park with its old, old dinosaur footprints. Too cool to see in person.  The Fort in Radium Springs - old Fort used by the Buffalo Soldiers. Some history there.  The various dams (Percha, etc.) That line the Rio Grande all the way to Hatch, NM.  Hatch, NM - famous for its green chile, this is a town with a world renowned reputation. The eat at Sparkys or the Village Cafe is worth going to do. Go hungry, really. :-)  White Sands but also Dripping Springs (old TB hospital in a beautiful setting) or Aguirre Springs, on the other side of the Organ Mountains near Las Cruces.   Valley of Fires near Carrizzozo but is quite a drive. The latest volcanic lava flow in the continental US. (5000 years old)  Elephant Butte and also the Space Port. So much pretty with each.   Last, and most important, the hot springs. Why not go there for what the town is most famous for. La Paloma, Sierra Grande, and the one right on the river (can't recall right now) are my favorite.

It's a way to plausibly be able to later say they took either side, depending on whoever they're talking to.  If she's asked in public what she thinks, she can say she signed the bill.  If she's asked privately by a campaign contributor or other supporter (e.g. law enforcement union), she can say she was against it and looked for a way to veto it, but the passage was ""inevitable"" and ""you have to pick your battles.""  So, basically, she doesn't have to take any stand at all.  That is cowardly.  I thought it looked this blatant to everyone, but I guess my comment's current -3 score means it's not so obvious.  But to me, that's how it always looks.  BTW, for a bill like this, there's good reason to think that anyone in the executive branch would be opposed to it.  It definitely is political in the deepest sense of the word, but not right-vs-left, which is why it had so much support in the legislature.  It's inter-branch politics or government-vs-people politics, and the executive is always going to be the big loser any time we protect due process.  If Martinez didn't want to look like a coward, there were two ways to go. (But they both would have had a cost, hence the cowardice.) She could have enthusiastically supported and signed the bill soon after it hit her desk.  (The cost: law enforcement support.)  She could have vetoed it.  (The cost: popular support.)  Or she could set it up to be able to tell everyone she's on your side, no matter which side you're on. (The cost: nothing?)"

NewMexico,31hkk9,Keran1986,8,Sun Apr 5 03:37:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, don't ever get to answer these.  I used to buy hay from former Governor Caruthers brother. Its a old family farm, as in very very old. Every year they had a family reunion, and the governor was there. This was long before cellphones. I'm told everyone was quite a bit tipsy when state police informed him of the situation. He had to make decisions in a questionable state, from only one land line phone and statewide state police radio.  I was told he didn't drink another drop of alcohol for the rest of his time as governor.  I worked in the local county jail some years later, the riots were very much on the minds of jail staff, and they acted accordingly.  I don't know if there is fallout for telling this, but basically if I heard it it had to be public knowledge.  Thanks for pointing out the documentary, I will go see it this week."
NewMexico,31hkk9,FunkyFarmington,2,Sun Apr 5 05:45:43 2015 UTC,"Here's the link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aTaA7KIevrg It was very well done. I just wish they included more footage from the news and talked more about the people involved.  I imagine it must have been pretty tense working in corrections in the years following the riot. I know a lot of COs in California and they have a pretty relaxed and complacent attitude. I would think in NM in the 80s, there must have been some kind of feeling of vulnerability after what happened at Santa Fe."
NewMexico,31hkk9,FunkyFarmington,3,Sun Apr 5 06:00:16 2015 UTC,"I was working in maintenance, and it was my first ""real job"", so I was green to say the least.   Still know some of the jailers from that time, more than a few were BAMF's.k  They could go from jovial to full-on beatdown in a nanosecond, too.  Some of what I saw was complacent, even with the riots not too far prior. It depends. Some of the CO's couldn't pour piss out of a boot, for others it was the third or fourth career after the military, kind of like Mike in last weeks episode of ""Better Call Saul""."
NewMexico,31hkk9,walkerb,3,Sun Apr 5 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"I've toured the Santa Fe state pen (i.e., the one currently used to house violent convicts), and I can tell you that the feeling of vulnerability persists to this day."

NewMexico,31hkk9,LeftoverQuack,2,Mon Apr 6 01:45:13 2015 UTC,"Well to me the need for absolute control is a sign of vulnerability. But I will say I know next to nothing about the morale among guards there, so I will trust your statement."

NewMexico,31hkk9,FMFire,4,Mon Apr 6 03:05:00 2015 UTC,"I was a kid at the time, but you could tell this was something very unusually by the news coverage.  I lived in Albuquerque, about an hour south of the Santa Fe prison. The news footage, which I assume was on the BBC show, had a lot of smoke coming out of the prison, and national guardsmen lining up, but even as a kid, you could tell things were bad. A few years later our neighbor, Shawn McWethy, who was a cop, was killed by an ex-inmate from the riot. Apparently this inmate had helped/protected a guard during the riot and was given a ""good time"" credit to his sentence and was let go early. When I was in college, my friend was in the national guard in NM.  As part of his training, he went up to the prison with his unit to get a walk though in-case there was another riot. He said that the staff pointed out the burn marks, and ax marks from the first riot. Keep in mind this is over ten years after the riot. They've built a new prison and now you can tour the old facility and see these things for yourself.  Here is a book that talks more in depth about what went on The Devil's Butcher Shop"

NewMexico,314r42,LittleBrownNugget,11,Thu Apr 2 00:07:03 2015 UTC,"Depends a lot on what you're after.  Santa Fe has some pretty solid food, especially (but not exclusively) if you've got some money to throw around. Wait, what do you mean by evening? Because everything pretty much shuts down at 9:00 or 10:00. But if you're coming in at like 4:00, you'll have plenty to do. It's gonna be a little touristy, and involve eating, drinking, and looking at either old stuff or art. Depending on what direction you're coming from, you could hit up things like Bandolier or Tent Rocks (both of which are worth your time, though my preference would be Tent Rocks), and still make it to Santa Fe in time for dinner.  White Sands is a crazy alien landscape. It's awesome to look at... for a bit. If you're going to do it, definitely drive deep into it and find a nice dune to sled down. It's a little cheesy and nothing like actual sledding, but if you're only gonna be there once, it is a must. As /u/unknowndatabase mentioned, there's other stuff around White Sands. I'd plan at least one other thing if I was going to White Sands and had more than 1-2 hours to spend. Alamogordo is awful, but functional if you just need to grab some grub/supplies.  Oh, and I absolutely agree that if you have kids, White Sands is the answer, no question."
NewMexico,314r42,vyme,2,Thu Apr 2 06:24:07 2015 UTC,Bravo! Great opinions on both.
NewMexico,314r42,unknowndatabase,2,Thu Apr 2 13:32:08 2015 UTC,"I recommend surfing instead of sledding.  Get yourself a decent wooden skateboard and remove everything except the board itself (wheels, trucks, you know).  Get yourself a nice hunk of wax (like a candle) and wax the bottom up like crazy.  Use the sand to smooth the wax out a bit and then surf it up!  Loved surfin' the dunes when I was a kid."
NewMexico,314r42,harshbuzzard,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:10:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely trying this next time I'm there. My wife has family in Alamogordo, so we get down from time to time."
NewMexico,314r42,vyme,12,Thu Apr 2 16:11:47 2015 UTC,"White Sands, no doubt. It's like visiting another planet, it's that different."
NewMexico,314r42,bigsquirrel,12,Thu Apr 2 01:58:47 2015 UTC,Santa Fe isn't that great...  Take a hike on the sands.  Time well spent.
NewMexico,314r42,jereader,2,Thu Apr 2 02:52:45 2015 UTC,"White Sands is great. If you're taking I-10, Las Cruces has fantastic food choices. Breakfast in LC, and then a day at the dunes is a day well spent, and doesn't take you off of the interstate too far.  Santa Fe sits right on I-25. If you're on I-40, it takes no time at all to get from Albuquerque to SF.  Here's my biased opinion. Northern NM is very pretty. However, Santa Fe is terribly boring. You're time would be best spent taking in a sunset at the dunes."
NewMexico,314r42,goots95,1 point,Thu Apr 2 07:05:00 2015 UTC,"Seems like you can drive through northern NM and marvel at the most beautiful landscapes and then be bored in Santa Fe, or you can drive through the most boring landscapes in southern NM and then marvel at White Sands.  I live in Santa Fe, and while it might be a bit slow here if you're looking for an actual nightlife, I don't think you'd be bored visiting for a night (assuming you're here early enough that that night can end at 10:00). But still, the contrast between north and south is kind of amusing."
NewMexico,314r42,vyme,7,Fri Apr 3 06:05:39 2015 UTC,"I am an outdoors person and find WS to be the preferred stop. Not far from there are many things to see and do such as Aquirre Springs, Dripping Springs, Fresnal Falls, Cloudcroft, and many others. Alamogordo is a short drive for food and stuff so you will be able to get what you need. If you have kids, they will love WS much more than SF."
NewMexico,314r42,unknowndatabase,3,Thu Apr 2 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"If you only have a few hours on a whirlwind tour through NM, White Sands is my clear recommendation. It will make a big impression on you and you'll never forget it. Very cool and surreal.   Santa Fe is awesome, with great restaurants and a bunch of ""adult"" things like museums and galleries. But honestly I don't know if you would be there long enough to really experience it. And Santa Fe at night isn't exactly hopping unless it's the weekend."
NewMexico,314r42,HelenKellersJPEGS,5,Thu Apr 2 11:32:26 2015 UTC,"Whit sands is beautiful, hike it, enjoy it, not much to do but see it.

It's up to you wether you like historical sightseeing or missile ranges more."
NewMexico,314r42,Francotanko,4,Thu Apr 2 01:43:50 2015 UTC,I live in SF.  You'll miss out if you don't go to white sands.
NewMexico,314r42,vetting_the_test,6,Thu Apr 2 03:49:51 2015 UTC,"As a New Mexican, I'd say Santa Fe. There are quite a few historic and interesting sites and great restaurants. Also, if you time it right perhaps you can swing by GRRM's theater if you are a Game of Thrones fan. As far as white sands, the name says it all. It's pretty much just white sand. I'm not a fan"
NewMexico,314r42,PickleDGAF,2,Thu Apr 2 00:32:38 2015 UTC,"White Sands is great! I take a trip  to white Sands about every two weeks,  if you can take a successful set hike. Check the website for your dates."
NewMexico,314r42,cinimod-,2,Thu Apr 2 04:41:05 2015 UTC,"Lived in SF, now in Ruidoso. If it's an evening in SF, then most of the museums/galleries will be closed anyway  (depending upon your exact arrival time). Go to Alamo, Stop by Cloudcroft as well!"
NewMexico,314r42,Jambitx,2,Thu Apr 2 05:15:19 2015 UTC,"White Sands. I love Santa Fe. It's got a lot of variety and entertainment, pretty nice shops and restaurants... But White Sands is alien and gorgeous and surreal. Beautiful blue sky and mountain backdrop, then soft sparkling white sand that is so bright it's hard to look at ( wear sunglasses). This time of year there's blooming desert plants to find too. Unforgettable."
NewMexico,314r42,Elleiram,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"I'd choose evening in Santa Fe. No town in USA quite like it.  Driving to/from white sands is a pain ... nothing but open plains. Unless you're already in the area.  Alamagordo is a God forsaken military town that should be avoided at all costs. Las Cruces can be fun, like a visit to Old Town Mesilla."

NewMexico,30vbzf,Netprincess,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:00:15 2015 UTC,"So what you're actually paying for here is the documents required for the training.  There's a binder with a bunch of information in it that you need to read through in order to be able to handle the birds.  Once you've done that, there's a test to take, which someone has to grade.  Also, I believe that there is now a DVD as well.  WRI is an entirely non-profit organization which survives solely through donations.  $25 covers the costs of printing all the materials, as well as helping out the clinic a little.  So you're not really paying $25 in order to volunteer.  You're paying that money in order to become trained in handling wild animals, as well as to use the training materials.  And this is a one-time fee.  Once you've gone through the training, you can go there to volunteer whenever you like.  I was a volunteer for five summers, and still go back there when I'm in town."

Lots of federal money pours in to do federal government activities, not just to support New Mexicans."
NewMexico,30axuy,Rostin,8,Thu Mar 26 03:11:00 2015 UTC,"I think that is actually a part of the ""dependency"" that the article is discussing (they include federal employment as one of their factors).  It makes sense, most of the ""good"" jobs in this state are with the federal gov't, whether military or lab.    When you take away those, what's left?  Oil jobs (down by 33%, apparently) and a few other big employers that could probably be counted on a few hands.  Most major companies that i've seen come through have pulled out quickly, citing a lack of educated and employable people in the state.  I love NM but it's a tough place to be.  Then we have the WIPP mess where the state govn't is basically biting the only hand that feeds it.  Brilliant!"
NewMexico,30axuy,masturbathon,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:53:12 2015 UTC,Yeah the lack of educated is definitely a problem I saw when I moved back. Employers will often have technical positions open for some time before they are filled.

It depends on the skills needed.  I work in a 100+ person IT department that includes developers, system admins, network admins, DBA's, Analysts ... Etc.  We never really have any issues making quality hires.  Sure, with highly specialized fields they take longer.  When I get to the office tomorrow I can tell you exactly what the time to fill rate is with our tech positions."
NewMexico,30axuy,NMHacker,3,Fri Mar 27 03:20:48 2015 UTC,"Adding on to this, the way they calculated dependency was based on the ratio of federal taxes paid vs. federal benefits paid for. This means that states with low and generally poor populations get labeled as highly dependent because they pay so little in federal taxes, whereas most of the really small and densely populated states on this chart are considered independent. It's not really a matter of political culture, it's the simple fact that a smaller state can get by with much less school systems, infrastructure, and other federal projects while a state like New Mexico has many small isolated communities which require their own schools and infrastructure."

It's only 80 in may but it will be 100% sunshine and really low humidity depending on where you are coming from so drink plenty of water because any perspiration you have will evaporate really quickly so you sweat more but feel drier and people get dehydration really quickly when they don't realize how much they have been sweating.    But as everyone else has said it truly is beautiful and awe inspiring out there.  The Bitsi badlands are really worth the extra trip if you have the time.  But all the hikes that have been recommended here really give you a great view of the park.

NewMexico,2zwbpn,DeltaGravity,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:22:10 2015 UTC,"I moved back to Farmington in the late 80s, went with my dad to the flea market the next day. I passed out, fell flat on my face and it wasn't even 10 in the morning yet. I was 18 and very healthy. I had gone from sea level to 5600 feet in two days and all the walking was too much.  I also jumped in Navajo lake that summer not knowing that the water wasn't like the gulf of mexico. Salt makes you more bouyant, and I thought I was going to die.  Bring lots of water, lots of sunscreen, portable food like snack bars and realize we don't have cellphone service everywhere. When I moved back my dad insisted on having old jackets in every vehicle just in case of having a breakdown and having to spend the night in the car. Its good advice.  But go anyway. Just take it easy and be reasonably prepared. This state is the most awesomely beautiful of them all, its worth it.  Read some Edward Abbey on the way, too."

NewMexico,2ze5oc,rosie_the_redditor,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"If these bars had cut these patrons off, perhaps some of these people would still be alive. Is the law still asinine with that set of facts?"

NewMexico,2ze5oc,rosie_the_redditor,0,Wed Mar 18 12:30:27 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, is your suggestion that bars should be allowed to serve obviously drunk patrons, let them drive, and take no culpability for the resulting loss of life?   Because if so, that's asinine."
NewMexico,2ze5oc,Hook3d,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:58:02 2015 UTC,"But were they obviously drunk? Just being over the legal limit isn't a guarantee that you'll show signs of intoxication in a brief encounter with the bartender. Clearly they were too drunk to safely drive, but the level of coordination needed to drive is higher than the level needed to walk a short distance and close your tab."
NewMexico,2ze5oc,Mrgoodtrips64,0,Wed Mar 18 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"It's asinine to assume a bartender will always be able to tell if a patron is too drunk to drive. Sure it's obvious most of the time, but some people can act totally sober but then drive like the drunken selfish idiots they are once they get behind the wheel. There's never an acceptable excuse for driving drunk, but it's not fair to punish the business' or bartenders."

NewMexico,2ze5oc,Hook3d,2,Wed Mar 18 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"I think the families should place their blame squarely on the dipshits that get behind the wheel drunk, it's not like anyone told them they have to drive. Bartenders will call a taxi for you if you ask for one. Blaming the bar is like blaming Glock when someone uses a gun of their manufacture to kill someone in cold blood. It's an individuals selfish choice that ended up costing innocent lives."
NewMexico,2ze5oc,Mrgoodtrips64,-3,Wed Mar 18 16:19:40 2015 UTC,"it's not like anyone told them they have to drive.   Nah, the bar did something arguably worse: they got them liquored up and then didn't say a word when they got behind a wheel.

Like the bars' selfish choice to worry more about short-term profits than the safety of their patrons and the general public?"

I've never been to a bar that can see you get into your car. How do they know you don't have a Designate Driver, or a taxi waiting? If you don't say something how are they supposed to know? they aren't all knowing. They are going to be wrong sometimes, no amount of punishing will make them right 100% of the time."

NewMexico,2z4nwg,steve626,2,Sun Mar 15 17:32:12 2015 UTC,That's how it is in Albuquerque and the Central Valley with snow.  You just wait until noon or so and it will be gone.
NewMexico,2z4nwg,ddp,3,Sun Mar 15 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"New Mexico has a bunch of different climates, from Santa Fe on north it's more mountainous (and very pretty) whereas from Albuquerque on south it's much more desert-like, so the answer's going to depend on where you end up.  It would not be hard to find a place with no yard maintenance, relatively speaking.  The mountains do get snow and it's been a pretty good winter at Santa Fe, Taos, and Angel Fire.  That said it's supposed to be 70 tomorrow in Santa Fe, so you can add 'nice spring' to the list too.  :-)"
NewMexico,2z4nwg,ddp,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"It depends of where I can find a job, but I'm hoping to start in Albuquerque and develop a few relationships so that I have a little social outlet before I find my own place far away in the desert.  So if most places will have minimal yard maintenance, that opens up a lot more 'perfect' possibilities for me.  If I have to mow, I'll figure it out like I am here, but I hate having to ask neighbors for help and would rather avoid it if I could."
NewMexico,2z4nwg,steve626,2,Sun Mar 15 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"ABQ (like Tucson) has lots of zero-scape yards, you'll be fine.  I do wonder about your dream of living ""far away in the desert"" though.  Rural NM is pretty rough around the edges.  It's some of the poorest parts of our country and you're as likely to encounter Spanish (or NM's unique dialect of it) as you are English.  I don't speak Spanish and I love visiting it but hopefully you're aware of what you're getting into.  Good luck!"

And I'm really good at being poor and plan on staying that way, so I'm hoping I'll do okay.  If not, I'll come back with my tail between my legs, but I'm so unhappy here so I've got to at least try!

NewMexico,2z4nwg,steve626,2,Sun Mar 15 20:27:07 2015 UTC,"Snow occasionally, but it melts pretty quickly on the roads. My neighborhood has rock landscaping with small beds for planting.   Hiring a lawn service seems more reasonable than moving to a new state—just google ""lawn service"" or ""landscaping"" for your area. Depending on where you live, you can also plant your yard with slow-growing Native grasses."

NewMexico,2z4nwg,johnnysocco5,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:14:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on what part of the state you end up living in and what your preferences on landscape are.  New Mexico has a lot of desert but it also has lots of forested areas. I have grass in my yard by choice. I Have to cut it about once every two weeks until monsoon season hits, then weekly.  Also if you have a tough time with gas powered lawnmowers look into electric ones."
NewMexico,2z3c2q,spriggen3245,2,Sun Mar 15 04:10:18 2015 UTC,"Well, there's Ruidoso and Cloudcroft (which feature the Lincoln National Forest,) if you want some cool mountain pines on the general route down. The town of Lincoln itself is okay if you're already out that way and into old timey Western stuff. The path down from Ruidoso to Roswell features the Hondo Valley, which some people think is neat. Alternately, swinging up around Cloudcroft then down the backroads will provide good  views on Reservation land, and dump you out past Roswell. Or you could head the other way to Alamogordo, which has White Sands, which can be a day trip if you want to sled down some sand dunes or somesuch. Alternately, there's the Valley of Fires out by Carrizozo, which are giant black lava fields that all sorts of life is growing out of now, which has some cool trails. It all depends on the route you plan, because there's a fair hour or two of driving between these spots.  If your path down does take you down by Roswell, consider stopping off at the Bottomless Lakes State Park for a less touristy/developed version of the Blue Hole. Might be fun to compare/contrast the two.  In Carlsbad itself, general recommendations seem to be the Trinity for a fancy little spot to stay and/or Eat. Otherwise the Stevens Best Western is the biggest chain in town, and also features what passes for night life with one of the only bars. I've heard pretty good things about Yellow Brix for food but haven't been. Danny's Place and Red Chimney are serviceable BBQ joints, and a green chile cheeseburger + milkshake combo from the Church St. Grill is probably mandatory. Carlsbad does have a drive-in movie complex, if you've ever felt like doing that sort of thing. Works best if your car FM stereo has good speakers and you prepare proper provisions beforehand (the concession stand can be a nightmare at times.) They're also a bit finnicky as to when they're open, so check their Facebook Page.  I'm not sure what the Guadalupe Mountains area is like after our current weather, but it's also near Carlsbad/the Caverns and might be worth researching.  As for the Caverns themselves, you can ride the elevator down and explore all the big rooms fairly quickly, but I recommend taking the easy to walk paved path down into the Caverns. You'll take an extra hour/45 minutes, but it's well worth it. Not sure if they're doing the sunset shows where the bats come out yet. But look into that too."
NewMexico,2z3c2q,Jensaarai,1 point,Sun Mar 15 09:00:47 2015 UTC,"This is extremely helpful!! Thank you so much!  At white sands, is this inside a national park? Where would we slide down sand dunes? In terms of landscape, would you say this was more interesting than the Valley of Fires?  In terms of getting to Carlsbad, what would you say is the most scenic route for driving from Albuquerque?"
NewMexico,2z3c2q,Jensaarai,1 point,Sun Mar 15 09:10:37 2015 UTC,"Well, White Sands and VoF have been colloquially called ""The Salt and Pepper of New Mexico"" because they actually run up against each other, though the publicly accessible areas are far apart. Depending on your path down though, you could easily hit up both.  White Sands is a National Monument carved out in a far corner from the White Sands test range (where they occasionally like to test missiles/tech for shooting down missiles. Don't worry, that stuff goes down hundreds of miles away.) You drive a short distance outside of Alamogordo, pay a small fee to the ranger (there's a little gift shop/museum at the front) and follow the road until you find a good spot. It's fairly popular, so you'll spot plenty of other cars parked. Just keep going until you see some impressive looking dunes. It's a family friendly spot, so if you're unsure about anything, just stop and chat with people for info.  I'm not sure if they still do it, but during summer months they used to occasionally open the parks on full moon nights. With all the white dunes reflecting the moonlight, it's like being on another planet. Highly recommend that if you can swing it. Otherwise, early morning/late afternoon/dusk is best so you don't get completely baked out there. Cheap plastic sleds are usually abundant at the local Wal-Mart for tourists.  Oh, you also replied to me while I was editing some extra info into my first post, so it might be worth a re-read."

NewMexico,2z3c2q,Owenleejoeking,1 point,Sun Mar 15 09:51:09 2015 UTC,If you are going to the Caverns I would highly recommend a ranger guided tour. Check out the website http://www.recreation.gov/tourList.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=77813. You need to book this in advance as they are limited in number and sell out quickly.
NewMexico,2z3c2q,Positively_Pantless,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:34:30 2015 UTC,Ruidoso is absolutely beautiful. Coming down the interstate from ABQ to ruisdoso you can cross the firelands or something like that. It's a national park along the highway that is a giant cold lava flow in the middle of the flat. That drive with the lava and mountains is breathtaking.   There's the sinkhole lakes outside Roswell that are almost worth the half hour drive if you like being awed by nature and mans knack to profiting it.   Carlsbad is totally worth the day spent. I moved to Artesia from West Virginia and the caverns have been my favorite so far. If you do just the normal walk in elevator out (my recommendation) it'll take 2-2.5 hours wear comfy shoes and go to the bathroom on surface. I've been wanting to go back for one of the guided crawls but haven't yet.   While down south near Carlsbad make sure you pop over to White Sands.   If you stay in/near Artesia stay at the Artesia Inn- my boss always stays there when he's in so it must be nice.
NewMexico,2z3c2q,cybergata,1 point,Sun Mar 15 14:03:18 2015 UTC,"I go to the Caverns a couple times a year but I try to only overnight it infrequently because of the cost and quality. In the past year or two I've stayed at Carlsbad Inn and Best Western. At the time both were about $90 and were definitely motel quality. They did have nice staff and I saw no bugs. I'm not going to spend $250+taxes to spend a single night in that town so hotels are out. I don't think the bats start flying until May or June so I wouldn't count on that. There is a free weekend in April, you'll have to look it up on their website though. It's only $12 per person for entry but that weekend could save you guys a little bit. (Though side note here: I'd count up costs at the national parks y'all will be going to and see if the $80 annual pass might be a better buy. Also, that free weekend should be a National Park thing and not specifically the Caverns.) I'd take the natural entrance and count on it taking around 3 hours total. I'd suggest bringing water in a backpack. You can also take a snack to open at the bottom in the dining area and eat it by lantern light at the tables they have in the back. (Sounds nicer than it is, but it is a nice break). The Walk down is about 45 minutes to an hour and the Big Room takes about an hour and a half. It depends on how many people are there. Weekdays and mornings are nice because you tend to be able to take your time.        Since y'all will be in the area I would suggest going to the Living Desert Zoo also, it's on the opposite side of Carlsbad and it's nothing extravagant but it's another 2-3 hour attraction. The last time I went was about 30 minutes after opening on a Sunday and I'll probably shoot for that time frame again in the future. The weather was nice for both my group and the animals and by the time we got to the Javelinas it was feeding time, which was really a fun little experience.       Oh and there's also a drive in movie theater but I haven't gone in years.         One last thing, if you're going to be visiting other caves and trails, take extra clothes and shoes and keep them separate from the ones you wear in the big cave. They're combating a disease in the bats and it's now part of their protocol. They'll ask you when you purchase tickets if you've been in any caves in the past 6 months and if you're wearing the same clothing. You can read more about the restrictions on their website.        Have fun!"

Traffic in abq sucks because there is no bypass/loop like most big cities. Nothing against Belen I'm just not very familiar with it. Rio Rancho did pass a very humane but perhaps over-the-top animal ordnance within the last couple of years so you may want to look at that. I may get corrected on this but I would stay north of I40 if I was moving to abq. Abq is dialed into the organic, farmers market scene. I see those Jett Brown throwing vegetables commercials all the time. You will get it when you move here.  It's big city living so it has everything 3 or 4 times.

NewMexico,2z15rc,rosie_the_redditor,2,Sun Mar 15 02:14:02 2015 UTC,"NM as a state is pretty pet friendly. I would recommend you look for someplace in the north east heights. Pretty upscale, pet friendly, mostly middle aged people, and where the majority of the organic food stores are located (99.5%). I live in Bosque Farms, so I'm about 10 minutes from Belen. I would say someplace in town is better for you. Belen is pretty much the viejo village of New Mexico. You may look for someplace in Bosque Farms, about 30 minutes south of abq. Small little farm town. There are quite a few places there that are around 1 acre. You can find places bigger if you want. Some yard maitence is needed if you live here. Bosque is pretty expensive though. There is plenty of land to take walks on, or you can walk to the Rio Grande from anywhere in the village. If you have anymore questions feel free to ask!"

Started reading some an article on ""5 great neighborhoods in ABQ"" and the husband said aloud ""Find me an article on '5 areas the Tinfoil-hat-leave-me-alone weirdos live""....  I wouldn't go to that extreme, but we do like some space...  We wouldn't mind rural or farm area, just as long as there was decent internet (high speed cable or better), we've got Youtube channels to run in our spare time.    I LOVE hiking, and my friends tell me New Mexico there are places you can live where it only takes 15-30 minutes to get to places you can do full day hikes at."
NewMexico,2z15rc,Netprincess,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"If you go to the NE heights chances are you will have the Sandia mountains in your backyard. There are plenty of trails in the foothills, and even in the higher elevations. Some ""tinfoil-hat"" or just neighborhoods to be aware of: the South Valley(gangs), west mesa(except Corrales, which if pretty similar to Bosque, maybe a little more refined), downtown after the sun sets(unless your looking for a hooker, or drugs), south of central on the east side(just a little loopy). As long as you're in a town with running water and electricity you shouldn't have any issues with internet speeds, or tv if you want it."
NewMexico,2z15rc,Netprincess,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:02:15 2015 UTC,"I got to visit Jemez while I was out there, and that's close to Sandia Mountains, right?  I thought that area was kinda pretty, but also Tinfoil Hat (in a kinda good way).  Been looking at places, did find a possible place to live in Corrales.  It's definitely higher in price point and you get less space, but so far things we ""like"" are turing out to be tough to find.   I'm wondering with everyone's recommendations, do i just try to stay ""Above i-40 with the exception of Bosque Farms""  When you mentioned:  ""South of Central on the east side (just a little loopy)""....    Are people a specific type of crazy or weirdo?  Or just crazy stuff happens there?  Did notice some very odd ""for rent' listings out that way.  Like apartments shaped like triangles?"
NewMexico,2z15rc,janecollective,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"A perfect example of what goes on around central: last week I was down there test driving a car and the salesman said he needed to fill it with gas, so I just hopped into the car with him and we headed down the road. We pulled into the station and about ten seconds later two guys walk out of the gas station with a 24 pack box of beer. One guy just starts yelling run!!! And books it, but very slowly because his pants are sagging around his ancles. The other guy (the one holding the beer) kinda hobbles over to their truck and gets in. A few minutes later this woman comes out of the station store yelling and cussing about how these people suck and should get a life (I'll spare you the graphic language). She then notices that they are still sitting in their truck, and proceeds not to call the cops, but to throw her giant cup of soda at them. It missed. And they drove off. If you want to see some crazy shit, go to central. I would take every bodies advice and stay north of I-40. It just filters out 99.9% of the bad in Albuquerque. Also jemes is about an hour away. It's great country for camping, hiking, fishing, hunting, etc. The other places in the state that are as disconnected as jemes are atleast 3 hours away. Gila, Lincoln/Sacramento, and Pecos are some other areas you might be interested in."
NewMexico,2z15rc,oryxdrive,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:12:53 2015 UTC,"Hey, welcome!  Are you looking for apartments or for houses to rent?  What's your budget for the rental?  Most of the apartment communities in ABQ will advertise on Craigslist, ApartmentGuide.com, ForRent.com, and Zillow.  Any of those will work.    The Northeast Heights is the best all-around area to be in.  You're close to grocery stores catering to all price points (Kroger, WalMart, WholeFoods, and Trader Joe's in the NE Heights are all like within ten minutes of one another), hiking, some nice neighborhood bars (lookin' at you, O'Neill's on Juan Tabo and The Barley Room!).    You'll certainly find cheaper housing options in Belen, but like.. idk.  If you live in Albuquerque, you really don't have to commute more than like 20 minutes because traffic's a breeze and property/rental prices aren't so astronomical in the center of town that you can't afford to live close to work and shit, you know?    e: Also, as for pet-friendly, most of the apartment communities will charge pet fees (nonrefundable), pet deposits (refundable) and monthly pet rent.  Some places it's like $150/$150/$20, which is kinda middle of the road.  I've seen pet deposits all over the board.  One place does like $150/$15/$25, which is super bizarre.  Anyway.  There's a lot of pet friendly open spaces in the area, like you can totally take your dog to the Elena Gallegos open space or up La Luz."

I can't speak for any other towns, but as a product of Albuquerque's public schooling, there are lots of great ones. There are some that maybe aren't so good, but some of the private and chatrter schools are total jokes too.   I personally went to Bandelier Elementary and have worked there a lot. The teachers and staff are excellent and I met some of my best friends there. They have a lot of devoted regular ed, special ed, and gifted teachers.  Monte Vista Elementary  is where a lot of my friends went and they loved it there.  I've heard great things about Jefferson middle school and enjoyed my time at Wilson as it had great science and band programs. As for High Schools, Highland actually has a lot of fantastic staff and administration despite its reputation and having had contact with a lot of people who went to other schools, they all have good things about them. I had a lot of friends who went to Sandia Prep and really enjoyed the education and the sports too.  Hope this helps! Good luck, and I hope you find a place you like!"

Charter schools get a lot of flack in the media, but there are a few here in ABQ that are rated pretty highly and don't seem to have the corruption issues that the same kinds of schools deal with in other states.    If you can handle the politics involved, we have a few private schools that are also rated highly.

Don't be offput by the building-it's a squat little brick place with bars on the windows-but their salsa is like no other I've ever had, there's little chunks of avocado in it! Everything is great and very authentic, they have good breakfast plates, and there's a burrito stand by the register if you just want to walk in and grab something (it's pretty popular with oilfield workers). You can't go wrong with any of the taco trucks you'll see driving through town, though I'm partial to La Patrona.   Avoid Lucy's at all costs.  Trinity Inn is good for a more upscale dinner and glass of wine. I'd suggest Lucky Bull for something in-between. I like the Beer Brats.   Blue House Cafe and Bakery is nice to grab a cup of coffee and granola on the way out of town; they have hot food until 10 am but between 10 and noon it's just pastries and cereal sort of things."

You can read a few points on this thread Do you believe there should be a limit on the amount of weeks pregnant a woman should be to have an elective abortion? Why or why not?  The concise version is: no woman is going to willingly stay pregnant for 6 months and then just get an abortion on a whim. No doctor is going to abort a viable fetus without a really good reason. Women that end their pregnancy later generally do so after a lot of soul searching and deliberation. Many fetal abnormalities do not present until 20 weeks and then they are severe. The stories I have heard involve lack of lungs, organs developing outside of the fetus's body, only a partial brain, etc.   Yes, this law has exceptions for ""life threatening to the mother"" (which excludes health endangerment that doesn't threaten her life) but let us not pretend that carrying a child doomed to die is something anyone should be forced to endure. And that is what this law would do. It gets between women and necessary medical care.   Here is one women talking about her late term abortion  This is one lady on reddit talking about her late term abortion which wasn't for medical reasons But it does sound like it was the best choice for her."
NewMexico,2y8rxt,AlizarinQ,2,Sun Mar 8 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"Well, it should be amended to include health endangerment and doomed to die babies.  Her account is kinda why I am not really against this bill though, or at least maybe there should be funding allocated to education(which is severely lacking in NM when it comes to parenthood/abortions).  Or at least some allocation for resources to help women deal with the emotional trauma that comes with late term abortions.    I feel that this bill is a safety net because the ideal is a pipe dream when it comes to education and resources.  I agree with you, though it may seem like I don't, most doctors/parents will not go through the procedure without a good reason.  I think it's better though to have this safety net for those who lack the education/insight to make this decision and for dr's that would be willing to do it without informing their clients of the situation.  Is there a way to appeal to the senate to expand special circumstances?    I think the main reason I am ok with this bill, along with most people I know, is that there are people in NM that make very dumb decisions for very dumb reasons(as is everywhere).  I think it's more of a safety net for those who lack the insight and education.  That said, I appreciate you taking the time to educate me a bit, thank you."
NewMexico,2y8rxt,drjimhill,3,Sun Mar 8 18:03:50 2015 UTC,"hey cool, reasonable discussion  I think it would be hard to legislate ""doomed to die"" babies because, as in the example, quality of life becomes a factor. There is a spectrum from ""can only live on life support"" to ""requires frequent intensive medical attention"" to ""can breathe/ heart will beat but unable to mentally develop past infancy"".  But the woman in the story did come to NM to get a late term abortion and still had to provide a lot evidence that it was a medically necessary procedure. And that makes me think that there are already measures in place to make sure that the freedom isn't misused by people that do make ""dumb decisions"". What amoral doctor would go through with a procedure without informing their clients? And would legislation really prevent them from continuing to act in the same manner? Don't you need to sign paperwork to undergo operations? This sounds like a straw man doctor who would already be illegal.  I don't believe this bill is the right response to people that make dumb decisions though. Really I don't think people that do make poor life choices should become parents. If someone is poor and cannot support themselves, or lacks the emotional and mental maturity to weigh the consequences of their actions I don't believe that becoming a parent is the right choice. It takes a lot to successfully navigate the services available to impoverished pregnant women, or first time parents, or parents with children in specific age brackets- and they are all different services, they don't connect (even some case managers have trouble keeping it together). Almost 70% of women having abortions in the US are economically disadvantaged and over 60% already have at least one child.  I work in a homeless shelter. I have seen many women who have chosen to have children that they never had a chance of supporting. And those are wanted children, though not planned. I do not want to imagine unwanted children in that situation. I know people always suggest adoption in that situation but there are enough children in the world that need love and care, and not enough people are adopting them. And not all children are of equal demand.   I have only lobbied the roundhouse for homelessness issues, but there was a large group and we all split up and spoke with each senator and representative for a few minutes (each group spoke with 3-4 state congresspersons) but that was only to gather support for already proposed bills.  I  would imagine that the best way to amend current bills would be to speak with the sponsor of the bill, but that is just a guess.  Also, more numbers:   Nine in 10 abortions occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. (In the US)  Forty-six percent of abortion providers offer very early abortions (before the first missed period) and 95% offer abortion at eight weeks from the last menstrual period. Sixty-one percent offer at least some second-trimester abortion services (13 weeks or later), and 34% offer abortion at 20 weeks. Only 16% of all abortion providers offer abortions at 24 weeks. (in the US)   And numbers for New Mexico"
NewMexico,2y8rxt,AlizarinQ,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:09:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you said, and you raise some very valid points.    I think the discussion is sort of swaying away from the issue though.  What would a reasonable bill look like?  Realistically speaking, a majority of abortions happen before the 20 week mark(though I'm making the assumption that this bill is using 20 weeks to differentiate), I'm not going to bother sourcing this because there's enough anecdotal accounts to make this assumption.   To make point of the straw man doctor argument, I can see how you'd see this being a bit of a straw man.  And, to an extent you're correct.  It's assuming a worst case scenario, and it would be easy to presume that this person would disregard law anyway.  That said, despite this being anecdotal, I've worked in healthcare for 10 years (mostly mental health), I have seen plenty of shady practitioners who skirt their way around the law.  It's actually a bit of a problem in some parts of new mexico.  It's one of the main reasons there were strikes at St. Vincents hospital.    I guess my main point is; people are saying this is some right wing agenda.  That this is an intentional subversion of women's rights.  I can't really accept that though.  Most states have legislation against late term abortions because that's the best middle ground to meet on between pro life/pro choice camps.  I think it's important to establish a point where (-Without solid medical reasoning being; the health of the mother and quality of life for the child) the abortion is dangerous and actually killing a living being or causing severe emotional trauma to the mother.  My only experience with legislation was with at risk youth trying to get funding for a men's shelter in santa fe because of the increasing number of cases where men are victims of spousal abuse and rape in NM(I can source it if you want but it doesn't pertain to the point of this discussion) and I realize how difficult it can be to get things done in our state on that level."
NewMexico,2y8rxt,AlizarinQ,1 point,Sun Mar 8 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"A reasonable bill with what goal in mind?  If the goal is to reduce the number of abortions then I maintain that it is more effective and reasonable to work to prevent a situation where an abortion would be sought (comprehensive sex ed, access to contraception) rather that prohibiting abortion. There is evidence (which I'm sorry I can't effectively site right now from mobile) that this is much more effectively reducing abortions than prohibiting legal abortions.  If the goal is relating to preventing late term abortions then I think the most effective solution would involve testing fetal DNA, but I don't believe that wife variety of possible fetal abnormalities have been sequenced.  I'm sorry if I sounded accusatory when I stated that the ""shady doctor"" sounded like a straw man. I was interpreting it as creating a hypothetical situation where the law could hypothetical be somewhat effective. It did not seem like a reasonable and enforceable scenario.  It is viewed as a subversion of women's rights because it is following a pattern of mistrust regarding women and their fertility. There are doctors who refuse to provide sterilization to women without their husband's consent (yet there isn't a pattern of men being told that they can't get a vasectomy without their wife's consent) or because they don't have children ""yet"", or only one child. And women get refused IUDs because they have never been pregnant (usually outdated information is sited). Women get refused the morning after pill by pharmacists assuming they are promiscuous or irresponsible. (All current issues, not getting historic here)  Legislating that women cannot have an abortion is furthering this pattern that women can't be trusted to make their own decisions about what is best for them, their health, their family etc. Whether it is intentional or not, that is the message being sent. ""Women cannot be trusted to make this sort of life altering decision, even with a doctor's input. A politician (usually male who has no way of ever experiencing the scenario first hand) who has never met the woman knows better than her our her doctor what is best.""  Why is it important to establish a point after which abortion is prohibited, barring medical circumstances? I always felt that after the point of viability made the most sense (but I don't feel the need to impose that on others). Most stories I have heard indicate that if the woman wanted to be not-pregnant feel relieved post abortion. And I would think that those that aborted for medical reasons would fall into a similar camp as those that have experienced miscarriage (having experienced neither I could be wrong). Having counseling accessible is nice, but I don't know if I would consider it a priority."
NewMexico,2y8rxt,AlizarinQ,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:42:48 2015 UTC,"A reasonable bill with what goal in mind?      To establish a point of limitation where abortions should not be performed.  To reinforce guidelines established by healthcare authorities where it would be considered dangerous to the mother and would be considered ending a life.  As much as people don't like to hear this, hospitals are business.  They want to make as much money as possible.  I've seen accounts of this time and time again (my mother was a surveyor for the joint commission and would let me peek into notes from time to time).  Establishing this would submit a secondary backbone for the wrong types of medical establishments, which do exist in plenty of places in NM.  It would make it easier to enforce these regulations.   I'm sorry if I sounded accusatory when I stated that the ""shady doctor"" sounded like a straw man. I was interpreting it as creating a hypothetical situation where the law could hypothetical be somewhat effective. It did not seem like a reasonable and enforceable scenario.      I wasn't offended, it was a straw-man scenario but it was a valid one.  Just because something contains a logical fallacy does not mean it should be dismissed.  I still believe that it's a very possible scenario, so I guess that's just something we'll both have to disagree on which is fine.     It is viewed as a subversion of women's rights because it is following a pattern of mistrust regarding women and their fertility.

""Women cannot be trusted to make this sort of life altering decision, even with a doctor's input. A politician (usually male who has no way of ever experiencing the scenario first hand) who has never met the woman knows better than her our her doctor what is best.""      You're using the same straw-man type of thinking that you said that I was, which I understand.  But, this is also a case of seeking the reasoning which best fits your argument.  The truth is, people are dumb when it comes to healthcare, and not all healthcare providers make the correct decision.  My mother, who recently died of cancer, would have died a lot sooner if she didn't have the medical understanding that most people lack.  She had a bowel obstruction(as well as her cancer coming back), the E.R. doctor wanted to operate on her and she refused.  She knew her cancer had come back, so did her other doctors.  If she had allowed this to happen she would have died much sooner.   I can easily apply this scenario to abortion.  People don't always know what's best for them, that is why they go to doctors.  I agree, patients need to educate themselves the best they can before going to a doctor to make the best decisions, but that's rarely the case.  There needs to be established guidelines for health purposes.  Having a vagina does not grant you any special authority on: The value of a human life, medical standards of compliance, safe medical procedures... etc.  Just as having a penis does not grant you that authority.    All of that said, I agree with a lot of your points.  Education and reforming our archaic sex education programs is a key factor in this.  I went to High School in Las Vegas, NM, I graduated with about 6 pregnant women.  I have also dealt with women who used abortion as a secondary means of contraception(some used it as primary), the emotional tole it took on them is insurmountable.  Eventually they got to a place where they were severely suicidal, so I think there are some mental health aspects that should be valued here."

This is more about when is a fetus developed to a point where aborting it is a violent act against a living being.  I think this will put it into better perspective for you- http://www.parents.com/pregnancy/what-my-baby-looks-like/.  This is why 42 states ban late term abortion.  Here is another source, look at week 21- http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm   Your baby can hear. The baby is more active and continues to move and float around. The mother may feel a fluttering in the lower abdomen. This is called quickening, when mom can feel baby's first movements. By the end of this time, baby can swallow.   Having a uterus doesn't give you understanding of human development, it's a catchy slogan for a sign but doesn't really give an authority on what is or isn't considered a living being."

Both of these could result in traffic citations if you fail to get or update your license within the required time period.

Though if you happen to be under 25, you have to take the ""One For The Road"" DWI awareness/prevention course. In the past it was a self study program with a book you had to fill out, but it may have been updated to an online program. It has been a while since I knew anyone who had to take it. You can find the details here. Yes the page talks about ""new drivers"" but this is where the info is for anyone who is 24 or younger. The section for 18-24 is near the bottom and covers the ""None For The Road"" course requirement.   Otherwise, as long as your license is valid, you have no outstanding tickets in any state, and no DWI/DUI history, it's pretty simple. All the details are in the link /u/Kittymane posted.   We do also have just an ID card, and it wouldn't require the DWI or ticket check, nor the DWI course if you are under 25. Though if you already have a license, I recommend getting the license if you can. Otherwise down the line if you want a license, you may have to take the written test, the road test, or both."

NewMexico,2xtqhj,lajaw,2,Wed Mar 4 13:11:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe the Valencia valley?  An hour from ABQ is pretty limiting.  And the further from ABQ or Santa Fe, the cheaper (usually) the  land.  There's hospitals all across NM.  Why limit yourself to one area?  NM is big.  Lots of great [places to live (if you can find water)."
NewMexico,2xtqhj,whiskeydeltatango,0,Wed Mar 4 02:25:00 2015 UTC,"My husband and I have looked all around the state at hospital networks and there is 3 in ABQ and 1 in Santa Fe. If we were to move further away yeah there are other hospitals but what if they suck and he has no choice but to stay? He is really interested in hospice work too. He does a lot of end of life care and chemotherapy currently. Besides that concentration, I couldn't find anywhere else with choice. But feel free to correct me."
NewMexico,2xtqhj,Bat_Manatee,6,Wed Mar 4 03:01:17 2015 UTC,"Nearby Albuquerque I'd look at Moriarty, Edgewood, Bosque Farms, Peralta, Las Lunas, & Belen. They're all very different towns compared to each other but within an hour or so of Albuquerque and usually have cheaper land, more rural, allow/have more animals."
NewMexico,2xtqhj,whiskeydeltatango,2,Wed Mar 4 04:28:10 2015 UTC,"Well, you never know if they ""suck"" until you try them.  Being an RN, jobs are pretty plentiful.  Even in NM.  Nurses have high turnover as it is.  If you don't like it, you move on.  Don't buy property until you feel comfortable.  And most hospitals won't give you a sign on bonus until you've been there at least a year.  Nursing is one of those jobs that allows you to move around without penalty.  Maybe try a ""traveling nurse"" position and see what you like on 6 month contracts."
NewMexico,2xtqhj,thorstad,1 point,Wed Mar 4 03:11:13 2015 UTC,Yes he has noticed there are a lot of Travel Nursing jobs in New Mexico and has expressed an interest to try. Of course when he talks to his fellow nurses they just point out every bad thing that can happen. He works with a lot of well settled people with kids that would never dream of an adventure.

I highly recommend taking 285 rather than 25. I find 25 to be pretty monotonous and 285 really gives you a feel for the character of the small towns you'll drive through. Best to take 285 all the way from Denver but if you're sorties about snow in the mountains you can hop over on 160 through alamosa. Stop at any place that looks interesting to you. Destinations are too numerous for me to list.   From Santa Fe to white sands take 285 to 54. There's not a lot in terms of stopping. But the landscape is absolutely majestic. Make sure you fill up on fuel at clines corner. After that you're going for a while before there is any gas.  I've come very close to running out. There are many towns that used to have gas stations but they have closed and the towns no longer have any gas. As you get closer there are some wineries but I've never stopped.   Enjoy white sands! Make sure you check the website to see when they're closed for missile testing. I highly recommend camping at white sands, but only if you're prepared for lite backpacking. Its gorgeous at night there."
NewMexico,2wkua8,steve626,2,Sat Feb 21 00:52:16 2015 UTC,"Great suggestions.  This weekend is snowy so we'll probably stick to 25 this time, if only for predictability.  They are closed for camping Sunday night, but we are camping there Monday-tuesday.  Which way would you suggest taking back to Denver?  My car only makes it about 280 mi per tank, so distance between ammeneties is always a thing."

NewMexico,2wkua8,Netprincess,1 point,Sat Feb 21 08:54:59 2015 UTC,You should be fine at that mileage. Mine gets 300 per tank and I've always been fine. I've only ever taken 285 to white sands. I think you can get there on 25 also but it's longer and not as scenic. 285 from Santa Fe to white sands won't get much snow. It's all flat.   And even 285 from Denver to Santa Fe isn't horrible in snow as long as you take 25 through Colorado Springs and then cut over on 160. But 25 would play it safe if you're concerned. I drive a Subaru so I'm fine with mild snow. You may want to do 25 if you're in 2wd. You could always decide last minute also. If there's not much snow in the radar when you drive through Colorado Springs I bet you'd be fine taking 160 over to 285.

I'm bilingual, and I landed a teaching job the day after I applied.   What draws you to Northern NM? I'm not sure about the job market, but I can speak to the people and climate. The stretch from Ratón to Santa Fe follows the Southern Rocky Mountains, so it can get surprisingly cold/snowy in the winter. Beautiful scenery though, and summers are a lot more mild than they are in the central/southern part of the state.   I live in Albuquerque, but my experience in the the towns you are looking at has all been friendly. Keep in mind that they are all pretty small population-wise, so job opportunities and things to do may be limited. If you want to be around people your own age, you might want to look more into Taos. The atmosphere is a little more artistic/bohemian, so it seems to have more of a draw than Ratón and Las Vegas."
NewMexico,2wjs58,schiefei,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:11:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for commenting!  I am drawn to northern New Mexico because of the mountainous climate.

I have had so many people think we are Mexican because of the Spanish language, but our ancestors had never even been to Mexico. Anyway, only the older people speak any Spanish anymore, a teaching job shouldn't be any harder to get for not knowing Spanish."

If you want to go Fishing there are some great spots full of beauty. My favorite for Fishing is Trout Lakes and/or the stream near the cliff jumping spot - forgetting name atm. Both these spots are a bit more than car camping, but fires and such are ok as long as the fire restrictions aren't in effect.   It's been ages since I've been fishing the San Juan / Animas though. Those were some awesome rivers. You also might want to set some time for the Fishing up near Durango, CO.  PS. Watch out for fish between the mine on the Red River and Questa, NM.

I was a danger to others, and my fusion of old school New Mexico attitude and politics with the other stuff mentioned above is probably a real darn good reason to get me off the road before I corrupt some kids and ruin democracy for everyone.

The flip side of this is you have to be prepared for anything and be able to find a trail and read the land well, as trails often peter out, then pick up again later. Which is fun if you like that kind of stuff, and dangerous if you don't.    Also, a lot of places are really wild and there are lions, bears and rattlesnakes.  My morning running trail has a bear I have to watch out for, which I like a lot, but again: not for everyone.  I think worse than bears and lions are the wild packs of dogs in some more isolated semi-rural areas like Pecos and Arroyo Hondo.  Once, running Sandia, I jumped over a big stick in the trail that was actually a rattlesnake."

Unfortunately for him, it's pretty standard contract law that when you can return the item after purchase for a refund, you agree to the terms by not doing so.  New Mexico seems to follow this standard..    The best case I can find on this issue in NM is Fiser v. Dell Computer Corp. Court of Appeals of New Mexico, 2007   “[t]ransactions in which the exchange of money precedes the communication of detailed terms are common.” Moreover, “[n]otice on the outside, terms on the inside, and a right to return the software for a refund if the terms are unacceptable ..., may be a means of doing business valuable to buyers and sellers alike.”"

He misconstrued what Martinez was aiming at and it's the lousy federal government that is withholding money to the most impoverished state in the nation.  Martinez is right to want to make the project less expensive to avoid passing on cost on to the sparse private industry actually paying for healthcare in the state.  The state has little to no commerce and increasing the costs of doing business is bad for the NM's economy.  The sole purpose of the Fed's goal to ""align NMHIX on the preferred path"" is make Obama's healthcare plan seem more accessible and therefore more successful- rather than the reality that it has been a disaster.  Buffoons that blindly misappropriate facts for hyperbole, prossnownm, are part of the problem.  Martinez applied for funding correctly.

It is called capitalism and economics inside the manufacturing process.  For sometime, solar has been at the break even point.  However, because it hasn't been inside the consumer marketplace, you can't even discuss how profitable it is.  The simple fact (and this comes directly out of the mouths of the manufactures) that over half of the built solar technology never sees the sun, refutes the claim that it isn't ""profitable.""  We honestly don't know if it is, or isn't.  But tell me this.  How can you say is not profitable, when I/you/Joe Blow can outfit a house to be off the electrical grid here, pretty much anywhere in NM, for around $10K in material?

If you want specific directions ask, I believe the website has decent directions.   Or, you can go north to the Abiquiu Cliffs. North of Santa Fe, past the Abiquiu Reservoir. There is a dirt road going West before you hit Echo Ampitheater. I don't believe you can actually camp there, but I did once and didn't get hounded.

I sure hate it when folks, especially LE themselves, try to put roadblocks in front of that accountability. We don't want anarchy, we just want people to do the right thing and for it to be addressed if they don't, and by addressing the issue fairly and honestly. Secret documents, special categories of citizens and secret hearings are unethical. If cops are unethical we really don't want them around.   What is sad is most every agency signed a ethics oath at the request of Governor Martinez. Cities and counties are technically political subdivisions of the State of New Mexico, I don't know of any that did not have every one of their employees sign this oath. I am baffled at the behavior of APD if they have in fact signed that oath, and they should be charged with malfeasance as public officers if they did and are found to have participated in any unethical behavior.

However, the state requirement for the liscensure has the following stipulation:   Minimum of 24 semester hours in at least one teaching field such as: mathematics, science, language arts, reading or history, etc., 12 semester hours of which must be in upper division courses. Source.   The good thing is, I think this is included in the degree plan. You can see the core classes here.   Here is the Graduate Catalog. I assumed you were going for secondary education, but this may not be the case.   I would consider emailing their Graduate Coordinator if the catalog doesn't answer your questions. I can also do more digging. Hope this helps!   Edit: I didn't realize I was responding to OP. I think the answer to your questions depends on what you intend to teach, and what program you enter. If you are going to teach Environmental Sciences while attending a MA program with the intent of becoming liscenced, I think that might work. If you want to teach something else, I think you would have to have enough credit hours from your BA (again, while you are obtaining your MA/Teaching Certificate).   Again, I just want to reiterate that I am NOT in an education program but I have done a little research. I think your particular solution will depend on your specific circumstances."

There has been a significant amount of learning that has gotten ripped away from them. I fear when and if they do manage to make it to college they will yet again remove criteria that is needed. No set of grade-specific standards can fully reflect the great variety of abilities, needs, learning rates, and achievement levels of students in any given classroom.

NewMexico,2rvoh5,polkadotgirl,0,Thu Jan 22 04:49:33 2015 UTC,"In what sense are you asking that question? Do I know Gallups school/ education history? No. Do I know the demographic of Gallup? No, I would assume it's much like here. Tons of natives that live in/on the res and a seven people family sleeps in three rooms. The Mexicans that come here are just thrown into a school because that's where kids belong, in school.  Speaking Spanish during class hours and English amongst their friends....do I know if Gallup gets new books every time a new one is created? I can say no on that too but their isn't a school here in the state that is public that receives said books on time if ever."
NewMexico,2rvoh5,feindish,2,Thu Jan 22 05:00:46 2015 UTC,Sounds like you really do not understand Gallup. Way different dynamics and population than where you are. One of the poorest counties in the nation.

NewMexico,2rgfck,RileECoyote,4,Tue Jan 6 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"Okay: quick thoughts.  TSV is beautiful (incredible skiing), but if that's out you could consider the usuals: hiking, snow showing, sledding, drinking, etc.  It's a pretty remarkable place, but TSV itself doesn't offer a lot outside of these recreational pursuits.  Martini Tree does have a good apres ski scene, and pulls decent music every now and then.  THe bavarian is the bavarian, which is unlike anyplace lse in terms of slopeside beer drinking.  The town of Taos is cool.  Quintessentially northern NM, of the artsy and hippie ilk, versus the old and broken down and full of poverty and sadness variety.  Probably not more than a 1/2 day to take it all in, unless you really like expensive art and/or are easily amused.  Pueblo of Taos is cool.  The little village of Arroyo Seco has a good coffe/breakfast icebream place, and a cool vibe.  Within half an hour you've got the gorge bridge, worth a stop.  Take a drive around the mesa to see the earthships, then hike to the stagecoach hotsprings, weather permitting you can jump from a spring into a freezing river.  Totally no infrastructure, expect to see naked hippies.  A scene from Easy Rider was filmed there.  Santa Fe is an easy drive should you want to expand your net a bit.  More expensive art, yay!  Weather permitting, check ""The High Road to Santa Fe.""  This is authentic NM and unlike anything you will see in the US.  Worth it for the drive alone, even if you skip SF.

Kasha-Katuwe means ""white cliffs"" in the Pueblo language Keresan.   The area owes its remarkable geology to layers of volcanic rock and ash deposited by pyroclastic flow from a volcanic explosion within the Jemez Volcanic Field that occurred 6 to 7 million years ago. Over time, weathering and erosion of these layers has created canyons and tent rocks. The tent rocks themselves are cones of soft pumice and tuff beneath harder caprocks, and vary in height from a few feet to 90 feet.   The monument is open for day use only and may be closed by order of the Cochiti Pueblo Tribal Governor. A 1.2 mile (1.9 km) recreation trail leads up through a slot canyon to a lookout point where the tent rocks may be viewed from above. A 1.3 mile (2 km) loop trail leads past their base. The park is located on the Pajarito Plateau between 5700 and 6400 feet (1737–1951 m) above sea level. The monument is closed to dogs.

They hold dances and ceremonies all year round, most of which that are kept private, with no outsiders allowed inside the village during these times. They do hold dances that outsiders are welcomed to come see.. on their Feast day on August 4th during Christmas and New Years Day. On Dance days all the men and women dance in unison to a single drum while another group of  men sing the prayer songs and stories. The dance they'll be dancing is called the Corn Dance. It's very beautiful. The dances will start around noon and end around 4pm. If you got any more questions feel free to ask.  Edit:changed august 1 to august 4"

So all Pueblos follow their traditional AND catholic teachings so some dances incorporate a lot of Catholic things into them. I'm going to be in Santo Domingo on New Years Day because they dance on that day as well. I will be in Acoma Pueblo on Christmas day. These dances aren't like Pow Wows as there's no clapping or cheering and these aren't competition. The dances are very sacred and religious to the Pueblos and are performed at different times throughout the year. There won't be no market or concessions in SD (Santo Domingo). Atleast I don't think so."

Also, the only things that have picture taking rules are the surrounding Native American territories, which is their right to enforce, and exist in most reservations.

NewMexico,2o0xzv,devosion,12,Tue Dec 2 08:24:11 2014 UTC,"Considering how much of a tourist attraction Taos and the surrounding area is, I find these accounts to be a bit odd and off. Much of Taos' economy comes from tourism and people skiing in the area so they are accustomed to seeing new people. While Taos is a small town, the few times I've been there have always been enjoyable and never found any of the locals to be rude in any respect. I think you just need to make your own account of the place. It's easy to be swayed by what other people have to say about some place, but it's always important to experience things yourself."
NewMexico,2o0xzv,wvanbeckum,14,Tue Dec 2 16:38:46 2014 UTC,"No one has pointed out yet that there exists a slight prejudice against Texans in New Mexico, especially in the towns where there is a large tourist industry.    I'm from Santa Fe, and I have noticed this time and time again... Let me try to summarize what I've observed.  If you ignore the tourist scene, Santa Fe and Taos are pretty quiet towns.  And if you observe stereotypes, Texans are pretty loud and boisterous.    The result is that these two cultures tend to clash.  It's not that Texans are always rude, or New Mexicans are ignorantly stereotyping.  But my guess is that your brother ran into troubles when entering small towns where he made it clear that he was a Texan.  This is not a problem that is unique to NM and TX.  When I've traveled abroad, I've always noticed that other cultures don't automatically take kindly to me as an American.    My advice, respect the culture that you're entering.  Try to read the area where you are.  If you walk into a restaurant and everyone is speaking softly, do the same.  I work in tourism, and I often find that a group of Texans will walk in and destroy the ambiance of a quiet place.  Respect the atmosphere and culture of a place and you'll be treated with respect."
NewMexico,2o0xzv,BornToClaire-ify,5,Tue Dec 2 21:53:00 2014 UTC,"Lived in Santa Fe for 10 years and I now live in Dallas. This is 100% true.   I love Texas, but you got it dead on -- NM is much quieter."
NewMexico,2o0xzv,ekrause92,8,Wed Dec 3 05:36:57 2014 UTC,"Back when I was stationed in NM, I used to be a season pass holder at Taos Ski Valley. It's one of my favorite places I've ever been. Gorgeous scenery, incredible riding, and overly polite people. I hope to go back one day. When you get there, go and eat at Michael's Kitchen for breakfast. You will not regret your trip!"
NewMexico,2o0xzv,AntennasAreMagic,8,Tue Dec 2 09:30:14 2014 UTC,"Some stores are a bit paranoid about the ID thing.  Many won't accept a ""vertical"" New Mexico ID (which you get if you were under 21 at the time of issue), even if it's obvious that you're over 21 now, due to the date.  I guess doing math is illegal.  This makes absolutely no sense to me, as anyone who's going to get a fake ID, will certainly get an ""over 21"" horizontal one.  This guy seems to agree: http://www.santafenewmexican.com/opinion/my_view/reader-view-vertical-id-is-a-legal-id/article_ea4fd3a8-d37e-51c3-9618-b8b7bd19a617.html"
NewMexico,2o0xzv,abqnm666,6,Tue Dec 2 19:57:44 2014 UTC,"Yeah the vertical ID thing is the biggest load of BS I have ever heard, but almost every bar and liquor store in the state has the same policy. It started about 8 years ago when there was a bill that the legislature was trying to pass that would have required liquor establishments to only sell to those possessing a horizontal, ""over 21"" ID. Rumor spread that it was law, and pretty much every place in the state picked up on this and it became policy within a few months.   Sometimes you can find a manager who will understand and override the policy, but with how harshly the state treats servers and liquor establishments who serve to underage patrons, I understand their fear of selling to someone underage. The only problem is that if the patron possesses an ID that is valid and indicates that the bearer is over 21, the establishment and server can't be held liable. Most places just don't care and would rather not take the risk and just stick to the policy of no vertical IDs so there can be no doubt, so it is really a pain for anyone who is recently 21.   And this is really bad for someone who just turned 21 in NM. Now that our IDs are issued by mail, when you go to the MVD, you are given a paper temporary ID to use with your old ID. And bars won't accept the paper ID when used with a vertical ID, so it is nearly impossible for someone to actually go to a bar on their 21st birthday, unless they have made arrangements with the manager to accept their ID beforehand.   It comes from the fact that NM has had so many alcohol relayed deaths and is nearly the worst in the US for DWI, so the state goes after bars quite heavily for over serving and serving underage persons, even charging the servers with felonies for over serving. This has led to a culture of fear and pretty much nobody is willing to bend the rules even if the rules have nothing to do with the actual law.   So, if you come to NM and have a vertical ID and plan to drink, make sure you have a passport or some other form of government ID to prove your age."
NewMexico,2o0xzv,BornToClaire-ify,6,Wed Dec 3 02:17:15 2014 UTC,Can confirm.   I had to drive around Albuquerque for an hour with my friends on my 21st because I had that paper temp ID. Finally we found a place that showed mercy on me.
NewMexico,2o0xzv,abqnm666,3,Wed Dec 3 05:35:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah and it is even worse for those who can't go to the DMV exactly on their 21st to get the temp ID. It is really asinine. The server or the establishment can't be held responsible if the ID appears valid and they made a good faith effort to verify its authenticity, especially if they use the ID scanners. Plus it is pretty much impossible to modify the new style vertical IDs to make them look like they are over 21 anyway without obvious signs of tampering anyway. The old style vertical IDs, that was a different story. Those were easy to manipulate. You could steam off the hologram, as it was just a laminate, alter the date, and then iron the hologram back on. I had a buddy years ago who was born in 84 who did that and turned the 84 into 81 with a razor blade and it was accepted everywhere. This was back in '02 before the no vertical ID policy was ever dreamed up. The new cards you can't really modify and most places swipe the ID now anyway, and you can't cheat that. So it really is a pointless policy.   I take issue with bars and liquor stores who serve alcohol to people with an interlock license when they aren't supposed to serve them as it is a violation of their release/probation conditions. I see it all the time. Those are the people they shouldn't be serving yet most bars have no problem serving them. Stupidity is contagious, it seems."
NewMexico,2o0xzv,AntennasAreMagic,1 point,Wed Dec 3 05:55:47 2014 UTC,"Good gosh, this is absolutely ridiculous.  Growing up in North Carolina, we didn't have vertical ID's (this was almost 20 years ago though, maybe they do now).  My birthdate was actually wrong by one day on my license due to a typo.  I went to a state ABC store on the day of my birthday, forgetting that my ID said I was one day shy of 21, but they sold me stuff anyway, since I mean...c'mon, my 21st birthday was hours away.  And yet, the highways weren't full of DUI crashes, go figure!"

Mainly because there is nowhere worthwhile to do anything in town. There are a couple gems, I'm not saying it's totally barren.

And, lots of those state offices are like third world countries, I interviewed at one where the outer layer of the sheetrock was peeling off, and looked to have been doing so since maybe the 80's.

And in the last 45 years, the state has had 3 Republican governors, including Gary Johnson, arguably one of the best Governors this state has had. I understand that you may not be a big fan of the GOP, but you can't blame them for any of the state's problems.

The state house of representatives has been strongly Democrat since 1931 (with the only exception being 1953) Source (PDF warning). And while we go back and forth between parties for governor, to date there have been 19 Democrats and 12 Republicans since statehood. Source. Both of our senators and 2 of our 3 representatives are also Democrats.  As for freedom and guns (I don't know what the hell bootstraps even means in this context), for the most part, this state supports the whole constitution. We like our freedom. That's what this country was founded on, and I don't see how that's a bad thing.  Lastly, Democrats are pretty equally guilty of using fear and hate to sway voter opinion.

If you guys like beer I'd recommend stopping by one of the great micro-breweries in town.  My favorite is La Cumbre (Elevated IPA is awesome!)

It depends on your lifestyle. If you're looking for more of a city/suburbs sort of thing, NH has more of that, though around Albuquerque and Las Cruces you can kinda find that life and still have the desert and all the sunshine.

Most of the tourism for the last few are ski related. SF has an arts scene. Albuquerque is just the state's biggest city and thus draws people. These are all in northern NM (except Ruidoso, which is west of Roswell), where it is cooler and more mountainous than the south.  There is some tourism in the south, like Carlsbad, and White Sands (Alamogordo). There is something of an arts scene in Silver City.  Your best bet for tourism would be somewhere up north.

NewMexico,2klc3j,masturbathon,5,Wed Oct 29 02:42:15 2014 UTC,"Alamogordo has a space museum that is pretty great. A very short drive from Alamogordo is Cloudcroft, which is 9,000 feet up in the woods and has some very dark skies.  A good light pollution map to help you plan: http://www.astronomersgroup.org/Lighting.html  Also the home page from the link above shows events and whatnot.  In the mountains east of Alamo is the National Solar Observatory which is interesting to tour but quite a ways off. The road between it and Timberon has camping (IIRC, it's been about fifteen years since I've been down that way) and I recall some of the darkest skies and best viewing of the stars in that area, as it sits in a valley that blocks most of the light from Alamogordo, El Paso, and other bright points."

Another site you might be interested in around Roswell is Bottomless Lakes.  It's a nice little place you can have a picnic or grill, there's a shallow beach and paddle boats for the kids if you have them.  The area outside the shallows is pretty neat if you know how to swim and aren't afraid of deep water."
NewMexico,2klc3j,spasticjedi,2,Tue Oct 28 23:33:38 2014 UTC,"If you do go to Socorro, I would recommend getting there via Carrizozo.  380 west will cross a huge lava flow that is pretty cool and you'll drive just north of the Trinity Site (sadly only open 2x a year) and then when you get to San Antonio, stop at the Owl Bar for an awesome green chile cheeseburger.    Head north to Socorro, the interstate is quicker, but highway 1 (crosses 380 just east of the Owl Bar) is kind of nice, going through the river valley.  To the south on 1 is the Bosque del Apache wildlife refuge, should be some early migrating birds if you are into that sort of thing.  The mineral museum on the New Mexico Tech campus is pretty cool, or you can head out on highway 60.  You can visit Magdalena Ridge Observatory by going into water canyon (left off of 60) and driving up a dirt road (kind of rough, SUV no problem, sedan is a little iffy sometimes).  There is a gate at the top you won't be able to drive through, but you can park and hike up onto the ridge.  None of the observatory buildings will be open, but you can look west past the telescope building (big silver dome) and see the VLA.  The interferometer is farther along the road along with Lanmuir lab (weather research) at the end of the road.  The trip up and back from the canyon and hiking around the top could easily take 3 hrs depending on how fast you are.  Head down back to 60 (low gear, save your brakes) and continue west, through Magdalena (last gas for a looong way) and out to the VLA.  There is a nice visitor center and walking tour.  When you are done there, head back to Socorro and check out the mission church (newly restored) and maybe eat at the Twisted Chile, just north of the plaza.

NewMexico,2kawqs,postToastie,12,Sat Oct 25 18:05:36 2014 UTC,"King is in favor of only decriminalization state-wide, but he basically has no shot to become governor.  Between the two of them, yes, Gary is more supportive than Susana, but recent history (Gary Johnson) reminds us that a Republican governor can be pro-marijuana. However, that's more for future reference as I don't expect Susana to budge.   The organizations which are working to decriminalize have worked out ways to get around the governor, i.e. getting the decrim advisory question on the ballots in Santa Fe county and Bernalillo county for this November's election.  As far as recreational legalization, I believe polling in the state is actually encouraging, though not a landslide by any means.  I will be curious to hear how the vote goes in Bernalillo County this November, Santa Fe is basically a lock. Again, the question on the ballot is non-legally binding, but it's the best that could be done in a limited amount of time, and with the governor in the way. As opposed to a poll, the advisory question will represent the perspective of the electorate, people who actually vote. I expect more and more legislators to come out in favor of decrim/legalization the more they see voters increasingly standing behind it.  If memory serves, the Colorado governor who signed Amendment 64 was not in favor of it, but did not want to go against the will of the people.  I would not say it's out of the question to have things come to a vote ala Amendment 64 come 2016, but it's not likely. This is a complicated issue, and a lot will depend on how things continue to go in Colorado/Washington and any new states (or districts, Go DC!) which legalize.   I really wish I could give you a better answer, but in the meantime, keep an eye out for those advisory question results in Bernalillo and Santa Fe, and then there's always the chance of something surprising happening in the new year as bills are introduced.  My best guess is that we won't have an opportunity for legalization until 2018 or 2020, but I hope I'm wrong!"

That's like prescribing painkillers to 11,000 people and then only producing enough for 5000 of them to use.
