cleganebowl,3e3xht,SuperTonicV7,13,Tue Jul 21 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"Let's break this down.  C obviously stands for Clegan bowl and confirmed. As in CleganBowl Confirmed.  O probably stands for Obryn Martell, the first to fight the Mountain  N If you look closely, N is extremely close to M, Melisandra is spelled with an M and she worships the Lord of Light, which occasionally brings people back to life. Both Hound and Mountain were dead but are now obviously alive.  F clearly stands for Fucking Confirmed, a cheeky internet reference to being confirmed.  I most likely stands for Ilyn Payne, who was introduced by Sandor Clegane, 1/2 of the Clegane Bowl participants.  Now here's a tricky one. This post has a RM next to each other. Gregor Clegan is often referred to as the Mountain that Rides. Coincidence? I think not.  E, there is not one but 2 e's in gEt hypE at this point the author is just throwing bread crumbs to the eventual point.  D clearly is standing in for Dopamine. A neurotransmitter responsible for reward, pleasure and sexual gratification.  Guys I don't know how to put this, but… but I think this post is saying Clegane Bowl is Confirmed. It's almost basically right there in the title. Once you break it down to the base elements there's almost no other choice than to  GET HYPE"

It is really not that inconceivable that he's doing something similar on the QI while he heals.  But here's the kicker for me:  GRRM actually tells us that Sandor isn't at peace.  Go back and read the part where Brienne sees ""Driftwood"" on the QI.  He's as pissed off as ever, right? In fact, the brothers were unable to geld him because he bit off someone's fucking ear. I think, with all of the comparisons between Sandor and his horse that we've gotten throughout the series, this is pretty good evidence that Sandor's 'ungelded' and biding his time as well.  TL;DR:  If Sandor goes all sunshine and lollipops and 'I have to kill my brother because I love him and/or have found God(s)', I will Oberyn myself.  After Cleganebowl, of course, but still."

cleganebowl,3dmjqx,Uardo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:00:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, you could say it that way. But I think the ""at peace"" thing is not really relevant. C'mon, it was a monk that said this. I think Sandor is still the man in torment that he always was. I think he is pragmatic, he just says that he is religious to be living in the monastery. When he was working for the Lannisters he was the really loyal and honored dog, and then ""Fuck the King"". I think the same will happen. The Monk thinks he is ""at peace"" because he seems so, but after all he's just the ""Fuck the Monastery"" kind of guy."
