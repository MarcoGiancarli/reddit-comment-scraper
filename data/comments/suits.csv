suits,3e0f73,IAmScrewedAMA,29,Tue Jul 21 00:16:23 2015 UTC,Definitely a great episode! This season has been doing a very good job of reminding me why I got hooked on Suits in Season 1.
suits,3e0f73,nouscope,5,Tue Jul 21 02:12:19 2015 UTC,Yeah! It's very refreshing!
suits,3e0f73,Urbamech,2,Tue Jul 21 02:50:21 2015 UTC,Agreed!
suits,3e0f73,dmcarefuldriver,12,Wed Jul 22 00:22:31 2015 UTC,"For me what is making this season so great is Harvey. Humanizing him more is something they gradually did over the first 4 seasons, so it wasn't the most unpredictable avenue to go down this season, but they've down it so well. In Season 1 he was too much of a stereotypical badass lawyer, but now he is much more of a human with complex thoughts and feelings and some indecisiveness, but he's still a fantastic lawyer.  And they did all of this while also continuing to expand on Mike's storyline. Relationship melodrama has been drastically reduced, and the cases are great too. This season is a massive improvement over Season 4 so far."
suits,3e0f73,ScoutingGod,6,Tue Jul 21 05:52:41 2015 UTC,"S5 E3 and the pilot episode are pretty much neck and neck for my favourite episode.   This season is definitely up there so far with the better seasons (1&2 imo), and I think they're giving the majority of the viewers what they want to see (for me S5 E3 was so good because all of my favourite characters had winning episodes)."

suits,3dyues,rib-bit,4,Mon Jul 20 21:29:47 2015 UTC,yes - the hedge fund that actually funded the court case had a smaller fund that bought a lot of shares because it knew it was going to be a smaller settlement...

suits,3dyues,kenbr7613,5,Mon Jul 20 21:38:34 2015 UTC,the court case announcement would have sent the stock falling because investors would have feared a large payout/award by the jury if the settlement is much lower (wasn't 10% mentioned?)  the company pays out less money than investors expected so it will retain more money causing its stock price to go up an investor knowing the settlement amount before anyone else could buy (or sell if the settlement amount is higher than expected) the shares and wait for the public announcement of the settlement
suits,3dyues,bsk5,3,Mon Jul 20 21:34:03 2015 UTC,"If Robert took a smaller settlement from the insurance company than he should have because he wanted the insurance company's stock to go up (which mattered because unbeknownst to him one of his subsidiaries owned stock in the insurance company), it would have been insider trading."

suits,3drsu3,sofunt,-3,Sun Jul 19 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"I've been watching from the beginning  I respectfully disagree in regards to Donna/Harvey. Donna has never been unattainable and he's always treated her like a best friend. He barely noticed when she was sleeping with Stephen. That isn't the actions of a guy pining away for a woman.  The only woman of the main cast I could see Harvey wanting but never really making a move is Jessica. In season 1 he was all butt-hurt when he found out she was married. He's always telling her how great she looks. Season 2 when Hardman took won the vote first thing Harvey does is much into Jessica's office and says they should quit (not one of them singularly but them together should leave).  There was a scene during season 2 I think it was during the whole sexual harassment suit. Harvey and Donna are talking. In the middle of the conversation Harvey says something like you're beautiful. And you can tell (Sarah Rafferty was really good in this scene) Donna kind of looks down sheepish, blushing thinking he just randomly told her she was beautiful. But really he was talking to Jessica and you see the disappointment all over Donna's face. For minute there I thought the writers might go there with Jessica and Harvey.   Season 3 we'll ignore that dumb take over plot for a moment. But Harvey starts dating Scotty and it was Jessica that kind of broke it down to Harvey that rushed into a relationship with Scotty and maybe it wasn't the best course of action.  Beginning of season 4 the whole with Jessica in Harvey's apartment I mean come on that scene was pretty heavy with sexual tension. In Jessica and Harvey's case I think it's the opposite of the same coin. Jessica has no romantic interest in Harvey likes to flirt but doesn't see Harvey that way. Whereas Donna and Harvey are the opposite and more deeper. Donna is very into Harvey and he's just kind of like eh she's more of my buddy, confessor, and personal advisor.  This is probably going to be a hugely unpopular opinion but I think Suits could have been really cutting edge if they went the route of Harvey and Jessica. But I think the interracial angle isn't something Suits fans would really be into especially with someone like Harvey imp."

She would have so many conflicts of interest that they would be doomed to fail from the start.

All that said, this relationship bullshit does need to take a backseat, even though it is huge character development, and this show is supposed to be about the characters more than anything."

suits,3dtz9j,GirlWonder01,3,Sun Jul 19 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"While I personally don't mind the Donna/Harvey storyline, I believe the writers after season 1 saw people shipping/rooting for this particular couple. As a result it took this romantic turn starting with season 2. I think the whole ""thank you for 12 years"" doesn't constitute an ending to this storyline, they'll keep baiting viewers with this ship and maybe they'll get together in the season finale."
suits,3dtz9j,ductastic,3,Sun Jul 19 17:58:15 2015 UTC,"IMO, I never really caught a Harvey/Donna vibe from the writers. They never flirted with each other and whilst you could see they were close friends, there was never any point where one looked like they wanted the other. Compare that to Mike/Rachel in the early season and I think that it's clear what the writers romantic focus was.  The first hint I got that Donna was interested in a relationship with Harvey was when Harvey asked her ""do you want my relationship with Scotty to succeed?"" to which she replied ""I want you to be happy"", and that was in S3."
suits,3dtz9j,Alopolis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:55:02 2015 UTC,"thats exactly how i feel. i think for them to say 'i love you' is not really a problem. because you can still love someone without any romantic connotation attached. and if they left it at that, i would be perfectly fine with it. but once they started the whole fiasco of 'wanting more', then it just became so unappealing. especially since they've dragged the problem and we've seen the argument repeatedly thrown back (donna putting herself first & harvey being so possessive)"
suits,3dtz9j,somuchvictory,2,Mon Jul 20 01:20:31 2015 UTC,It's open-ended enough that the writers could make it romantic in the future.

Generally, in each episode, they are dealing with a single case that is resolved by the end of the episode, with the occasional multi-episode case. It's a drama, but it's got a lot of quick-witted humor and lighter portions sprinkled throughout the episodes. You also get some very touching moments when House shows his human side. Even though episodes are case by case, there is usually an over-arcing story that runs through each season, and you get a little piece of that story in each episode."

And Alan and Denny are the greatest TV pairing I have ever seen (Obviously, thats a personal opinion.

Also Harvey's ability to beat people stems from ""playing the man"" and it is hard to play Jessica, although I feel like Harvey is one of the few people who knows her well enough to be able to do so.  If they were straight up given a random case, I would put the odds at 60-40, favoring Harvey because I feel like he's better in terms of adapting to changing case circumstances, while Jessica wants it all planned out most of the time."
suits,3dnkgs,mc_Nutts,33,Fri Jul 17 20:59:08 2015 UTC,"Jessica, mainly because she helped make Harvey, so knows all of his tricks. She also seems to be much more of a pragmatist and less emotional (whether it is because she has to be as managing partner, or a personality thing, I'm not sure). This seems to be the antithesis of how Harvey works - playing on short, sharp shocks to gain a short term advantage and close.   Plus, both Zane and Harvey have referred to her the Chessmaster. I think if she truly wanted to destroy Harvey, she'd plan ahead and break him, while being largely immune to his short term tactics."

However I do completely agree about your theory of what Jessica's future title will be if she decides to pass on the mantle to Harvey or Louis.  Personally I believe that when all existing name and managing partners are removed in what is essentially a coup, the firm that emerges with a new identity is regarded as a 'new' firm. As the name of a law firm consists of the surnames of the managing and name partners. I of course could be wrong, but my personal take on this."

The first 4 seasons were far superior to Suits. Suits is a time killer, House was a trendsetter with its cynical-asshole-as-protagonist manoeuvre.  Also, if you compare the quality of TV when House was out, it was definitely a standout series, there weren't many comparable."

There is really no standout actor like hugh laurie/cranston to tie things together, more of an ensemble cast. Despite USA being notorious for wanting views over all else, I'm pretty sure House had higher ratings (need to fact check). Laurie had some record for most money earned per episode at like $450k at some point I think? That last point really doesn't have anything to do with emmy/quality, just wanted to point it out.

(last ep's ""shieeeet"" for example - try it with someone you barely know/worked with). Those banters you speak of are incredibly scripted and you can almost tell what they are going to say before they do. Plot is predicatble as well. They overuse Louis  for creating drama. Forced love drama....   I don't know first, maybe even the second season was good but then it went to totally being mediocre at best. Also there is no outstanding actor which the series suffers from too. Don't get me wrong I like they don't overuse totally known actors but those who are currently in...are not ...I don't know..

suits,3dka9n,FtotheReady,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:20 2015 UTC,"House was my favorite show for quite a long time and I love Suits, but I still think overall House was written quite a bit better. Sure people can complain about every show being some crazy case where House miraculously saves the day by thinking of something random, but that is not really the main plot of the show. Those medical cases were just a medium for the characters to see things in a different way, affect their decision making, and add to the overarching plot that was going on between everyone. A lot of controversial issues were raised in that show that really made you think. Lastly Hugh Laurie is a brilliant actor that really made House come to life. I'm not really sure if Suits is hitting that level. Suits is entertaining, no doubt, but I don't feel like it has the same intelligence factor to it.

I think it may be the case that because of what Mike said, Rachel now doesn't want to have kids, or is seriously reconsidering having kids, in order to protect them in case Mike's secret ever comes out.   Kids were a subtle, but key point that the writers brought up this episode. We saw it with Harvey and Esther and how Harvey knew that it was best to stop dragging out the fighting and get back to the important things in life. Maybe Rachel realised that having kids may not be such a simple decision for them because they will constantly have the threat of losing Mike hanging over them.   I said it in the discussion thread and I'll say it again here. Rachel is just starting to realise that she's not only marrying Mike, she's also marrying his secret. That's what the look was about. As they get closer to the wedding, there will be more of these looks and moments where Rachel realises exactly what she's signing up for"
suits,3dh3el,Alopolis,3,Thu Jul 16 06:31:59 2015 UTC,"I love reddit. Great discussion and point. I must admit I didn't think back to Sheila and Louis. As one other commenter said, hopefully they would be more original. I'm not completely confident they would. The writing has gotten thinner. But I like your remark about her marrying his secret. I'm a little surprised that exact point hasn't been brought up already in relation to their lives together. How far this secret will need to stretch now. To be honest, I do hope she doesn't want kids. Only because I would love to see her succeed finally. To have to pull off the gas a little and concentrate on family would be cutting her off at the knees. Mike gets to keep playing lawyer but she could potentially not be able to achieve the type of success she wants because Mike wants a family? Not to get all feminist on this thread but sometimes they seem to use Rachel as a punching bag. That's a whole other topic though."

They have never spoken about kids before until Mike made that comment and Rachel is so career driven, it would make sense for her to have mixed feelings about having kids.

suits,3dh3el,scooducks,3,Thu Jul 16 06:29:25 2015 UTC,"Good point, and I'm with you on this one. I think the look was because she was feeling that should they have a child, he/she couldn't stick up for Mike anyway, given his secret.  Would really be disappointing if they used the all-to-common ""can't have kids"" trope. Or reused the ""doesn't want kids"" one, that they've already used to break up a relationship.  Regardless, whatever it may be, I think Mike and Rachel would be able to get past it. At least I hope so, for as much hate as the Mike/Rachel relationship gets, I think it works, and I like it."

suits,3dh3el,bsk5,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:06:57 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate to say it I think she's infertile.

I understand jail time and what not would be involved Mike got caught but Rachel knew this when she found out. It just seems stupid that they would keep coming back to that.   Mike and Katrina have a bit of chemistry when they work together and it appears we might be seeing a bit more of it as this season continues. I think that mixed with Rachel's issue on pregnancy is going to cause a whole lot of drama for the remainder of the season.   Also this may be a bit farfetched but what if she's already pregnant and it's Logan's kid. Just they way that all played out never sat easy with me. The fact that she was going to see Logan and everything means there's something she saw in him that she didn't see in Mike."

Jessica found out and found a legal way for them to get out of having committed a crime, by divesting the shares (no idea if that actually works irl) to the plaintiffs (Mike and Robert's clients).

suits,3dh2c5,NinjaSm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:28:30 2015 UTC,"I know how Third Party Funding (""TPF"") works IRL (the hedge fund funding a class action of a lot of claimants is an example of third party funding).   To give a background on TPF, it was only recently introduced to the U.S. and the practise area is not as developed as it is in Australia or even the U.K. in some respects.  When a third party is funding a case, there is usually a clause in the third party agreement which requires the funder to be informed about settlement. Sometimes the funder agrees they should be involved in any settlement negotiations. Such a clause will usually outline how far they will be involved in such a settlement.   Watching the episode, it isn't clear what the terms of such a clause were, but it appears that Rachel's dad is the one who signed off on all decisions and Mike didn't have any power under that agreement - being another stick in his pile that he wasn't being treated as a partner.   NB - It is likely that there was a clause in the funding arrangement agreement that required the funder to be in the know of any settlement negotiations. It is also likely that such a clause required them to be quite deeply involved or at least in the know.  EDIT: On a further point - recent case law has required that funders are a lot more diligent in their due diligence and conflict checking before they fund in a case for reasons like this (that the funders have a conflict of interests in cases they're funding - that they might also own shares in a company which is being affected by the outcome of the said case). If the case went to trial it is likely that this would have been raised by the other side and the funder's funding arrangement would have been delcared as champertous and they would not be able to gain their winnings (if any)- it is also likely that they would be liable for any adverse costs from the case.  I hope that outlines the law - check burfordcapital.com for a lot more info on how TPF is currently working in the U.S.  (This isn't an endorsement - burford from my experience do appear to be the leading TPF in the U.S. though)"

Delta, the subsidiary of the hedge fund Robert used to finance the case, purchased the stocks at the decreased price, with the intention of reselling them at a higher price. However, since the settlement was not yet public, and they only reason they had knowledge of it was because their parent company funded the case, it would be insider trading, which is illegal.   Jessica then convinced Delta (more than likely under the threat of reporting them to the SEC) to divest their shares to the plaintiffs (who were clients of Mike and Robert.) Thus alleviating them of any criminal wrongdoing, however losing Delta a bunch of money. Because they lost money on this, they fired Robert, who was their attorney.

suits,3dh69v,sunstersun,-5,Thu Jul 16 06:44:44 2015 UTC,I think this whole season has been out of character for Donna. She's given up her personal policy of not getting involved with co-workers and expects something more from Harvey out of no where. She's gone over to Louis to make him jealous rather than distancing herself from Harvey even if it means leaving the firm for a bit. It's become kind of annoying.
suits,3dh69v,king_lloyd11,9,Thu Jul 16 06:36:59 2015 UTC,"What? Moving on to Louis makes perfect sense in her situation, she got a fresh start without having to leave the firm (their family.) She practically gave up her own dreams for Harvey and when she finally put her self first for the first time in 12 years you'd think she'd get a little bit of understanding. Didn't you watch the latest episode? Harvey himself finally understood it in this episode.     OP:  I love the fallout her decision had on everybody, this season got such a fresh take on everything because of it (and might just be my favorite yet), but with Harvey understanding and thanking her I think most of the drama there will be over. Which is good because I'm hoping they'll get back together in the end (at work or romantically, I don't care, I just want the banter back.)  That said I think it's always been a bit like that, her story has always revolved around Harvey or her being like a therapist to other people at the firm. Sometimes I wish they'd show more of her as her own person (and I definitely want more of Donna being a badass!)"
suits,3dh69v,sofunt,-1,Thu Jul 16 10:16:29 2015 UTC,"This rationale bothers me. It's clearly not a fresh start at all. She just works 100 steps away from Harvey instead of 10 now, and for the self-professed rival of the guy she's trying to make jealous.  The whole Harvey/Donna relationship is just stupid now. She left him because he denied her a serious romantic relationship when she asked for one. Now the show is making it seem like it was because she was unappreciated, when Harvey has always appreciated her and had her back just as much as she had his. Is it two times he's kept her out of prison now? Harvey just doesn't wear his emotions on his sleeve like the volatile and insane Louis. If she prefers the latter over the former, then so be it, but she was just as cold to Harvey after their separation as he was to her. I'm glad Harvey was the bigger man and thanked her though.  And just like that, the great Harvey/Donna drama is over within the first 4 episodes? Donna's going to go back to him even though she said she wouldn't? Like I said, terribly out of character and makes Donna look pretty dumb..."
suits,3dh69v,king_lloyd11,4,Thu Jul 16 10:53:45 2015 UTC,"Haha I see you're at it again.   It's a fresh start, Harvey can't deal with his feelings and Donna is tired of waiting. It has nothing to do with wanting to make him jealous - she's moving on. Seems like it might make Harvey realise he actually feels something more for her, but Donnas own goal is just to be able to move on with her life and move on from Harvey who's wasn't ready to have that conversation. As the other poster said - she didn't want to leave her firm or the people there, it's her family. She just went to Louis because unlike with Harvey she doesn't have feelings like that for Louis, he's just a friend who needed help.  Donna was nice and helpful to Harvey when she came into his office with the list of new secretaries, but Harvey couldn't understand her and lashed out and (just like Donna said) started to treat her like a stranger which made her snap at him too. In this episode Harvey finally realised she deserved better after sacrificing her dreams for 12 years of putting him first. God the parallels between the Harvey/Donna situation and the case with Esther/Husband was so obvious, I don't understand how you continue to be so oblivious to it."
suits,3dh69v,westerling,0,Thu Jul 16 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"It's how I view these characters. I'm not ""at it again"", it's been my consistent view.  How is moving to the desk of Harvey's rival whom he constantly either butts heads or has to work closely with, sitting where Harvey has to see and walk past all the time, a ""fresh start""? Just because she no longer works directly under Harvey, doesn't mean that it's some clean slate. She hasn't ""moved on"". She's moved 100 steps away. You rationalizing it as her ""not wanting to leave the family"" just makes her seem more co-dependent and weak, which again, is not what Donna is at all. If she wanted space from Harvey, she would've distanced herself from him. This includes not working at the place where his name is on the wall. She clearly doesn't want space.  But the role playing session and Harvey's epiphany in it should be a good indicator of what the actual situation is:  Donna: How the hell is moving on and putting myself first betraying you?   Harvey: Because you went to Louis to do it, and that's not moving on. That's sticking a knife in my gut and twisting it.  Donna: Yeah, Harvey, it is. How does it feel to be on the receiving end for once?  She hasn't ""moved on"". Donna wants to elicit feelings out of Harvey.  She's just put herself in a position where she can, even if it's out of jealousy, regret, and missing her.   It's not that Harvey can't, it's that Harvey won't deal with his feelings. We've seen him willingly be emotionally vulnerable with Scottie, but he doesn't want to take that plunge with Donna because, in her own words, ""you can't go back"". They both agreed that they shouldn't be involved as long as they worked together, and Donna was content flirting with him and doing the whole work wife thing for 12 years. They both saw other people and supported each other when they did. All of a sudden Donna wants more, Harvey says no, and she acts out.   Yes, the parallels are obvious, so if you were paying attention, you'd know that Esther's husband didn't sacrifice anything. He never sacrificed his dreams of becoming a doctor. The fact was that he couldn't and rationalized it to himself as making a sacrifice for her. If he actually had, Esther would be forced to give up 50% of her company. In Harvey's own words: ""And whether or not you believe he gave up everything for you, he does."" That's the truth of the situation. Harvey now realizes that Donna feels the same way as Esther's husband did. This doesn't mean that she's right when she does, just as Esther's husband isn't right but has convinced himself that he is.  And while we're on the subject, what dreams was Donna sacrificing working with Harvey exactly? To be an actress? Last I checked, Harvey actively supported her acting. Unless you're going to say that she sacrificed her dream of being with Harvey to work for him...which again...kind of pathetic and so not Donna. She knew what it was when she agreed to come with Harvey to Pearson Specter, and I doubt it took her 12 years to think otherwise. Again, giver her some credit here...and when you give her that credit, it comes with some accountability."

Season 1 had this go-to gimmick of stacking the cases against each other to say ""See? Juxtaposition""  So in this episode we got to see two cases: one involving unintentional and partially remediated consequences (the fracking oil company), and one involving a party stealing money with full knowledge of the consequences and implicating themselves by the thoroughness with which they covered their tracks (taking money from a non-profit and hiding it in Luxembourg).  I think this is what Lola learns by the end of the episode which changes the way she views her father and makes her say ""I'm going to try and work things out with my dad."""

suits,3d0lyj,Alopolis,8,Sun Jul 12 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're being downvoted, you're right.  Some shows (notably Game of Thrones) do write & film all their episodes before they air, others (broadcast networks mostly) film during their runs, and typically have 3-5 episodes in the can past what is airing that week. This goes for half-hour shows and hour-longs alike. It's a combination of factors - length of hiatus, episode order, etc.  I don't know how far ahead Suits is, but I would be very surprised if they were done with this half of the season already."
suits,3d0lyj,fulgaraverde,2,Mon Jul 13 01:33:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly, my point was that it's not as simple as generalizing it and saying ""all shows finish before they premier"" . If you looked at the actor's social media and constructed a brief timeline from when they started with season 5, and when they premiered season 5, you'd see that it's highly unlikely that they finished it all before the premier."

Judging by the sweeping generalisations you made, I'd guess you haven't watched an episode of BBT for a long time. The fact that you think they insert a laugh track suggests that you don't really know how they film TBBT.  Anyway, back to Suits. The first table read for 5.01 was 13 weeks ago. That means that they would have had to more or less, pump out one episode a week for 10 weeks straight in order to film all the episodes before the premier which was 3 weeks ago. I don't think that's realistic"

The actors would get tired from constantly learning new scripts and the quality of the acting would suffer. Not to mention they have to deal with characters such as Robert Zane who do other shows and so will have less time available to work on Suits.  Not to mention, if you look at the actor's social media and instagrams you'd see that they haven't been filming for 10 weeks straight."

suits,3d0lyj,GetMoneySmokeWeed,-2,Sun Jul 12 18:36:52 2015 UTC,It is absolutely not Patrick Adams' choice what hair style he has during filming. Not even a strand. They have a whole team dictating every detail of how the actors look during shooting.

They had their first table read of season 5 13 weeks ago. We know that from Meghan's instagram. From Patrick's instagram, we know that the table read for 5.05 was 6 weeks ago.

suits,3cnj5x,insular_logic,24,Thu Jul 9 20:08:37 2015 UTC,"Since its Tom Ford its not exactly a target you aim for when you start to work.  If you want my advice for a first (set of) suits:  A. Never go below $350 a suit, and that's pushing it. $500 preferable. Suits often come with dress shirts, otherwise you need these to be the same quality level when bought separately.  B. Thin and/or younger people get Italian cut. Chunkier and/or older people (think senior positions, CEOs) get English cut. Looks a bit more old school. Never get American cut - Americans their sense of style is abhorrent. Tom Ford is pretty much all Italian cut btw.  C. Supers. You'll see numbers range from Super 120 to Super 150+. This is the quality of the wool. Try to aim as high as possible, but this is not as important as the overall quality of the suit or the cut.  D. Don't skimp on other, complementary parts of a suit. Spend on two sets of dress shoes and two belts too - if they're shitty quality, people will notice. Get 7 ties (one for every day of the week +2 spares, so you can rotate easily) too. They need to be silk - don't get all fancy with knitted or exotic materials, don't get cheap with polyester or polyester mix.  Edit: downvoted for giving top notch advice. Typical Reddit."
suits,3cnj5x,orenzai,2,Fri Jul 10 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"Oh wow I didn't expect such a detailed explanation. Thanks for the tips! My my, the prices you mentioned are way out of a graduate's league. I'm always wondering how do people go about buying suits. Get them from a good brand name off the shelf and then alter to our body shape or just go tailor-made from the get go?   Anyway, I think you got downvoted because of your American style comment because well, this is an American majority website. Hah!"
suits,3cnj5x,insular_logic,3,Fri Jul 10 08:33:37 2015 UTC,"For a first suit I'd recommend Suit Supply. It's a combination of off-the-shelf and tailored (yeah I know sounds weird). Basically, they have different sizes, and they pick the size that's closest to you, then adjust those sizes so it fits. It's not completely tailored but it gets pretty close. It also hits pretty much all the quality concerns I mentioned for a fair price, and they are a one-stop shop for ties, shoes, belts, extra shirts and the suit itself. You can go cheaper, but then it will be off-the-shelf with no adjustments (think a suit from Zara or H&M etc). Those often run $100-200, and will look good to the average eye/at a glance, but anyone who sees suits on a regular basis or owns a good suit will notice the difference."

suits,3cnj5x,Thatguy7242,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"While I agree that as an exec or professional practitioner a great quality, bespoke suit is a necessity, I disagree that the average joe needs to spend that kind of money on a suit. Having an off the rack suit tailored (find a GOOD tailor) will make you look great as well. Just be careful with color choice and find one that complements your body type and skin tone. Typically, dark blue, gray, and black are an essential trio and can be worn many ways."
suits,3cnj5x,Skyline34,0,Thu Jul 16 13:56:17 2015 UTC,"Goodness, man.... Tom Ford is English, Saville Row bred, through and through. I kind of understand how you think Harvey's cut just barely might be vaguely Italian, but seriously - look at the lapels - they're a dead giveaway!! They're not even reminiscent of old Italian style! As for Mike, he takes the skinny modern lapel approach which is both utilized in Italian and American cuts. But some American designers like Hickey Freeman also go with bolder large cuts.  And on another note - your advice on getting a good suit is terrible as well! I agree that a $500 suit should be the standard if you've got the money, but in now way should someone spend $500 on a suit that doesn't fit them if they don't have at least another $150-200 to get it tailored! If you don't wear a suit often and don't have the budget for an expensive one, WAIT for a good sale, get a $500 suit for $350 and get it fucking tailored so it fits YOU. A tailored suit shows you have taste... an expensive suit that doesn't fit just says you have more money than brains.  And also - Wool needs to be carefully considered. Some of us live in warmer climates, have larger bodies or are just prone to sweat and heavy wool will melt your entire existence and make you more wet than I make your mother after a nice shag.  I will agree with you on ties though - except 7 are not needed unless you wear a suit every single day and then well, you should just get over the fact you're budget is going to be effed if you want to look decent. In which case, fuck all, blow your budget, be a boss, but not a Hugo Boss - fuck their suits.  You were being down voted presumably for horrendous advice.  Fuck.

We know he's been back at the firm for 12 years since his time in the DA's office, where he spent a few years, and we know that he was sent there by Jessica in the first place, which means he worked at the firm before that as well.

suits,3cm8c5,Shephards,9,Thu Jul 9 06:01:41 2015 UTC,"I do feel like this show has cut down all those characters down to the core bunch last season and so far in this season.   Who's not on the show that fit exactly what you described feels to be missing? Well lets see;   Amy (Mike's Assistant)  Dana Scott Katrina Bennett  Zoe Lawford  Jenny  Harold  Sheila  Trevor  Jimmy   and probably some more.   I think we all loved Mike's ""Donna"" aka Amy and feel that a lot more could have been done with her even with Mike coming back to the firm. I think we all really enjoyed Katrina and feel like if they had written more for her, she would have been a real standout secondary character on the show. Jenny and Trevor though while crappy friends in the end, were the only two connections to Mike's past (besides his Gma who died and the ex he slept with who was married) that the show had shown us. Mike not having any friends outside of work takes away some depth from his character. He would feel more grounded with at least a best friend (i get he works a LOT and has a fiancee).   Harold though while annoying, was a character in the office that we knew, and helped (along with Jimmy) ground the office. Right now there is no one we know at the office but the core team (Donna, Harvey, Litt, etc).   So yeah, this should has cut or moved on from a lot of secondary characters and though the episodes don't feel filled with filler or fluff, they do feel a little flat because the Suits world being shown to us is only populated with the core group, which is never better than a show with the core group and a really great rounded out cast full of secondary characters. They add depth and ground the world around our core group."

I don't think we need to give any partners at the firm speaking roles, I think if the firm just showed the main 6 interacting with them more it would suffice. Certainly Jessica, she's managing partner but I can think of a couple of occasions where she's actually interacted with other people outside the named cast.   Although, if you look at the actual charecters you can kind of understand why the show doesn't show too many interactions. Harvey has always been a loner. Remember that line in the pilot? He admits that he works better alone. So it's not surprising we only see him interact with his trusted circle (Rachel, Mike etc) . Donna has been exclusively Harvey and Louis's secretary. We wouldn't need to see her interacting with other people since she only works for Harvey/Louis. Rachel is Harvey's associate so she would work pretty much exclusively with Harvey.

Specter is the name on the wall of one of the biggest law firms in new York, he wins every case and every fight. He got Donna back earlier, he got mike back, he got rid of hartman, he has signed basketballs from the most famous players.   Donna is also portrayed as the sweet, loving witty character that gets along with everyone.  Jessica is the mean bitch not because she can be, but because she needs to retain power as managing partner.  Louis is the shitty character who always fucks up and everyone hates. Everything seems to go wrong and nothing is going his way.   Mike is the photographic-memory perfect lawyer with the perfect relationship but he doesn't have a degree.  Rachael is the paralegal who had some tough times but is doing okay in stanford.  That partner who recently fought with Harvey over finances is almost an identical replica of Louis except he doesn't seem emotional and doesn't have a ballet interest.   Think that sums it up"

Louis is humanized and the most relate-able character from suits, Harvey is cool and all but he's sort of a mystery and his character development has been a little lacking, but it seems like season 5 is trying to fix that. Everything that  Louis did wasn't because he's an ass, the intentions behind most of his iffy decisions were clearly fleshed out and presented in a context that defined his role as the sympathetic victim of his human flaws rather then the villain. & Donna? How could you hate the most charming and witty characters in the show. In my opinion, it just seems your ""pro-Harvey"" stance makes you dislike any characters that does anything bad to Harvey."
suits,3cn2vy,snipechedda,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:15:14 2015 UTC,"Being a whiny, insecure, conniver is ""humanized"" and ""relatable""? I have 0 sympathy for Louis. Everything he's done, he's done because he feels entitled to things even when he doesn't deserve them. Jessica never made him a senior partner because she felt he wasn't ready, and yet he felt unappreciated because of it and acted vindictive towards her and Harvey as a result until he was unworthily promoted for personal gain by Hardman. He shouldn't be a name partner, yet he blackmailed his way there. He was bearable because he has his comedic moments, but he's been absolutely insufferable since he found out Mike's secret. If you're relating and sympathizing with this guy, more power to you, but it seems like most people just make excuses for him acting like a total asshat.  I don't hate Donna at all. I really liked her. She's just done a 180 of who her character is, someone who's in control and poised, to become some petty damsel who needs her Harvey, gets upset when it doesn't happen, and is now going out of her way to make him regret his rejection of her which wasn't really rejection. I have no problem that she left Harvey even though he needs her, but as it was said in the role playing exercise, she purposely went to Louis to teach him a lesson. Again, not sure how charming that is anymore. They've made her annoying.  I don't care if a character does something ""bad"" to Harvey. I like the characters Travis Tanner and Robert Zane and they've constantly butt heads with him. I even liked Donna after she was fired and pissed at Harvey even though she deserved to be let go. I just hate how whiny Louis is and always was, and don't like how annoying Donna is acting at the moment. When she returns to normal, then I'll really like her again, but until then, I should be able to say she's annoying without being downvoted is all.  And for the record, Rachel is the most relatable person on the show."

Heck, sure I can get annoyed with Louis making some of the same mistakes over and over but I still understand where he's coming from (and don't even get me started on Donna again, I understand her POV completely.)"

I understand Louis, but doesn't mean I excuse his actions and sympathize with him. Like I said, he's a whiny, insecure, loser who overcompensates as a result. I'm not making excuses or feeling sorry for him in the slightest. He's pathetic.  Donna is annoying me because her recent actions are entirely out of character and seem out of the blue. ""You got me out of serving time in prison, but won't date me so I'm going to leave you and try to make you jealous to punish you!"" Please, this immature and petty behaviour is stupid and doesn't fit the charming, confident, and poised Donna Paulsen."

Never had any friends, was always socially awkward, never picked for sports during gym, you get the gist.   Now that he's grown up, he has power in being a named partner and sort of ""demands respect"" from his peers. But because he probably never had any friendships growing up, he doesn't understand that you can't say ""Shut up and do what I say because I'm the boss of you, and also we're friends right?""  He's got a temper which only makes it worse, but we know he still cares deep down about people, but any little thing makes him feel like he's being betrayed.  He's quirky, he's funny, and he's a blast to have around the rest of the characters. Can't blame him for his faults though. I don't see people hating on Mike for ""promoting fraudulent behavior""."

Banshee some of the best fight sequences in television. It's very underrated imo  Orphan Black I just like the show there are some brilliant character but the star of the show just watching her take on some many different character every episode makes it worth the watch.  I like Elementary. It's weird on Elementary it's another variation of Sherlock Holmes. For me the show does an excellent job of reminding you Sherlock's brillance. Suits just says Mike's brilliant and rarely displays it.   Penny Dreadful: love horror and Eva Green so that's enough for me plus it is a very good show.

suits,3ci24f,thebananahotdog,19,Wed Jul 8 03:52:51 2015 UTC,"Harvey Jessica and Louis are definitely older than that.   Harvey went to law school later than normal (about 3 years if I had to guess), then spent several years in the DAs office, came back as a second year associate and was a 5th year when he brought in McKernon Motors to try and land a junior partnership with Louis. I would say Harvey is probably pushing 45-50  Louis, by all reckoning, went straight to law school then straight to PH. That makes him 24 when he starts there, then working up to a 5th year before trying to split junior partnerships with Harvey. He is probably close to Donna in age, and likely about 5/6 years younger than Harvey. (~40)  Jessica was a partner by the time she met Harvey as a kid in the mailroom at Gordon Schmidt vanDyke. That would make her around 40 at that time, so she is probably more like 50-55 now.   Mike is probably in his late 20s, Rachel in her late 20s, and Donna is probably about 35."

suits,3cbjhv,Swaggarwal,4,Tue Jul 7 01:20:17 2015 UTC,"The fact that Louis asked if Jessica ""added an extra zero"" suggests Harvey pays closer to 90% of her salary."
suits,3cbjhv,supersmileys,3,Tue Jul 7 01:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's probably closer to that. Especially how Harvey words it ""I've been paying your salary ever since we came to the firm"" makes it sound like he pays most of it."
suits,3cbjhv,JoolNoret,3,Tue Jul 7 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"Or the part where they talked about how Harvey wasn't allowed a [paid] secretary as an associate, so he hired her himself. He just kept supplementing (partially or completely) since then."

When Jessica shows Louis it's $50,000 he freaks out cause he figured it would be around $5,000.  Anyone who thinks she makes a quarter million a year is out to lunch."

There is no such position as a 'legal secretary', the closest you will get is a paralegal which is what rachel is. Sure you might get a secretary with a bachelor of laws but a secretary is not going to do any legal work; give legal advice, do legal paper work, write legal memo's, etc you need to be a qualified registered lawyer to operate in a legal capacity."

Louis only said ""are you sure there's not an extra 0"" about Donna's difference in salary. So say Donna made 50k without the bonus, and Louis thought the bonus was something like 5-10k, and Harvey wanted to bring up Donna's salary to six figures and she gets 50k extra.

suits,3c9drn,moleculoso,14,Mon Jul 6 12:18:32 2015 UTC,Exactly the reason they should have stuck with the investment banker. There was so much opportunity for growth there and they fucked it.
suits,3c9drn,guustavoalmadovar,9,Mon Jul 6 15:44:46 2015 UTC,The investment banker angle was the only realistic hope of Mike's story ending well. The writers gave Mike an opportunity to put this fraud stuff firmly behind him and build something positive instead of living and constantly having to look over his shoulder and worry if he's going to get caught.   The writers can't realistically throw him another lifeline like that again. Which leads me to believe that the show is going to end with him getting caught in some way
suits,3c9drn,Alopolis,3,Mon Jul 6 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"He is relatively safe though, does not really have to constantly look over his shoulder unless someone suspects something. And his dream job is to be a lawyer because he wants to help people, investment banking isn't fitting his purposes.   He is also very good as Harvey's right-hand and together they are unbeatable."
suits,3c9drn,EddzifyBF,3,Tue Jul 7 17:03:08 2015 UTC,"You're right in the sense that he's safe if no one decides to look, but that's kind of my point. He's not really safe. If someone looks, or hires a private investigator or whatever, they'll find everything. He's not really safe and he will always be living with the fear of ""what if"" someone looks into him."
suits,3c9drn,Alopolis,2,Tue Jul 7 17:30:16 2015 UTC,"100% agree. Since the writers practically erased all signs of the first half of season 4's existence (after Mike went back to PSL) the show's really began to lose me a little.  To me that whole story arc boiled down to the writers beginning to write something truly great, but then pussying out of it because they want to play it is as safe as possible and eek out as many season as they can."
suits,3c9drn,Goftrey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:25:45 2015 UTC,I still don't know why they decided not to stick with that. So much potential and they only really showed him having one case. I would have loved some IB action and law action as Harvey and Mike carry on in their own fields independently.
suits,3c9drn,TheLogicalErudite,4,Mon Jul 6 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"I agree I wish that they would've given the whole investment banking thing more time, like a full season, but ultimately I think having him become a lawyer again was a good decision. Mike wasn't a good investment banker. He only ""hit singles"" and when he went for the homerun he struck out and completely betrayed his boss in the process. He never wanted to be an investment banker, his dream was to become a lawyer so I think it would've gone too far away from the original plot of the show if he didn't go back and instead just was an IB the rest of the series.   Also, I hate how the focus has shifted towards each characters relationships for basically the entire show. In the earlier seasons I looked forward to scenes with Mike and Rachel, but they milked that way too much and I'm just not interested in any character's love life now. I really liked in the earlier seasons how there was basically a different case each episode, it kept the show interesting.   Sorry for the unrelated rant, but I just binged the series this week and I think season 4 kind of made me hate the show, had to vent haha."
suits,3c9drn,snipechedda,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:07:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if he'd stayed as an investment banker then the show would be boring asf. That's only a good road to travel down if the show is coming to a close, but it didn't :)"
suits,3c9drn,GetMoneySmokeWeed,21,Tue Jul 7 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"This might get a lot of hate, but what if a turn of events happened over the remainder of the series and Harvey turned Mike in and in the last scene he's recounting the events to a jury."
suits,3c9drn,haoareyoudoing,15,Mon Jul 6 07:49:30 2015 UTC,"That would pretty much destroy every bit of character development in the show e.g. Harvey's beliefs in loyalty, and the relationship between Harvey and Mike. If anything, Louis would turn him in, making them all (Jessica, Harvey, Mike, Rachel and Louis all liable for not reporting it)."
suits,3c9drn,xeallaex,2,Mon Jul 6 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"All I can say is that with the twists and turns that the series has led us through, almost anything can happen. Don't bank on assumptions that the writers will forever maintain the character developments. Loyalty only goes so far, and to predict that Harvey has Mike's back under any circumstance would be foolish.  As for Louis, I agree that he would turn Mike in, but come on, with his fare share of sabotages and blunders (as evidenced early on in this season), if it were to play out, I don't think anyone would say: ""Wow, I really didn't see that coming. Louis backstabbing/accidentally outing Mike? WHOA, plot twist!"""
suits,3c9drn,haoareyoudoing,3,Tue Jul 7 08:16:40 2015 UTC,"Well, provided  that they write it well enough and Harvey has good enough reason (or a viable way to win the case once turning him over, barring deus ex) then I don't see why it'd get a lot of hate. It's the least expected route, though, since there's no real way Mike could get out of it (I think?)"

suits,3c9drn,trail22,2,Tue Jul 7 04:04:04 2015 UTC,"Jessica doesn't want anything to do with Mike. If it were up to her, she'd turn Mike in in a heartbeat.  This could happen, but Harvey would have to be absent or in disdain of Mike to let it happen. Even if Jessica turned Mike in, her firm would be in a lot of hot water, and if we know Jessica, she's worked tooth and bone to get to the top, and she won't let anyone go after her."
suits,3c9drn,haoareyoudoing,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:18:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah but only jessica has shown herself to be harvey's equal.

suits,3c9drn,trail22,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"Aside from the loyalty thing with Harvey, if he were to turn against Mike, it would probably cause even more major issues with his relationship with Donna. In one of the past seasons, if I remember correctly, one episode alluded to the idea that Donna wanted Harvey and Mike to work together since it would give Harvey the chance to develop more as father/brother/mentor figure to Mike and could ultimately make Harvey more vulnerable/open to develop other relationships...such as the one that Donna wants to have."

suits,3c9drn,randompaul100,7,Mon Jul 6 14:01:41 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason the writers keep bringing it up is to remind the audience just how delicate Mike's situation is. How easily he could lose everything he has. Like others have said, the fact that Mike is a fraud underpins the entire plot. I agree with you in that the show has to end with Mike getting caught. There have been too many near-misses for that not to be the case now. Mike getting caught would really close the story arc and the series."
suits,3c9drn,Alopolis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:41:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the show will definitely end with Mike getting caught and I can also see Harvey and Mike basically finding a way to take the entire hit in order to protect Rachel, Donna, Jessica, and Louis (maybe?). ""You go, I go."" Then you might see Donna also try to take some of the blame and Rachel might try as well, but I'm sure Robert Zane will fight off her involvement in court. Jessica might also try to jump into the mix and save at least Harvey. Not sure about Louis, he tries to be loyal, but usually ends up making matters worse or more complicated.  In essence, I see about half of the last season being dedicated to Mike and Harvey getting caught and the whole cast banding/uniting together in court."

He knows Mike's secret and it doesn't bother him because he likes Mike, but that's why he pushed the pre-nup.  I believe that when he told Mike that one day someone Mike pissed-off will come after him, means he wants the pre-nup to protect Rachel when the secret comes out and Mike loses everything.  edit: that doesn't mean we won't revisit the law degree storyline again, just that it will turn out Robert knows and might be turned into an ally in the next arc-revisit."

suits,3c44fy,rubberbandnot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:01:45 2015 UTC,Not really. The season was already out so I watched them one after the other. Harvey was sitting in his office chair and thought about something while the music was playing. It was just a short part then he got up. I think it was no music from his records but just some background music so he didnt listen to it.

If it's a short part with just instrumental music I'd suggest listening to some of 'The XX', they also have a female singer and they are often playing during moments like that so you might find the song that way.   With such a vague description, it's very hard to find a specific song like that.  Good luck though."

I think the fan base really wants to see them end up together though. So I think Harvey will end up loving her.
suits,3bznj5,glitterinwonderland,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:23:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I'm not so sure if I even like or could believe this plot line.  They're basically breaking up without ever having been together... Why not try it out if its going to end in a breakup anyway, it might and obviously will work.    How are we supposed to believe he's this afraid when he clearly put himself out there with Scotty and was completely fine.  Why won't they just date already? Doesn't want those worlds to collide?  What does that even mean?  The worst end result is she leaves, which is what she's already doing now.  It feels really weak to me and I'm having a hard time buying any of it.  Huge fan of the show but if this is their big story arc that's supposed to have us on edge for an epic climax I'm pretty disappointed.  Now if it ends with a twist and they don't live happily ever after or there is some major time hopping that could be fun, but otherwise, meh."
suits,3bznj5,AlmostEasy89,6,Sat Jul 4 00:24:06 2015 UTC,"""Don't crap where you eat""  That's what Harvey is believing here. If he and Donna go out, there's an equal chance that they will work out and an equal chance that they won't work out. Harvey is scared that if they don't work out, she won't be happy and want to leave and that ruins his workplace environment. Hence the ""You have everything"" line that Donna said. By having Donna as his secretary and not going out with her, he gets the best of both worlds so to speak.   By them going out together and attempting to have a relationship, it brings the two worlds together. The professional relationship and the personal relationship. Harvey is scared of those two worlds colliding and him loosing Donna."

It's usually really new or popular tracks and they've always done that in the same way they have silly scenes with over-the-top movie/pop culture references. They don't fit into the plot or mood or emotion of the show (that meeting S05E01?). These are meant to appeal to everyone who follows newer music and gets a lot of the pop culture references.

If TV was perfect emulation of real life, it would be terribly boring. The goal isn't to feel real, it's to be interesting television.  Second, even if the previous point wasn't the case, how do you call that good character ""DEVELOPMENT""? Even if you say that he's a well-written character because he feels real, you say that it's good development, when the complaint is that he cycles back and forth between two things without ever making progress. That's the opposite of development.  ""feels real"" should not be used as a justification for bad writing."

She's Managing Partner she's not going to put in the same hours as an Associates. Managing Partner is running the firm mostly not actually handling cases.   We have seen her work on several cases with Harvey. Ava Hessington case she assisted Harvey. Last season we see her in court against Cahill. Season 1 when Harvey's old boss (can't remember the character's name) tried to blame his misconduct on Harvey, Jessica acted as his attorney. Those are just off the top of my head.  Thirdly the show is about Harvey and Mike. You would probably bitch if we had whole episodes centered around Jessica's work."

If they change the pay structure to focus on billable hours then it would not just impact Harvey, it would impact Jessica, because it is not her job to do many billable hours. The writer has overlooked that for Harvey vs Louis drama.  I guess you could cover it up by saying she has a far higher salary for being managing partner so it doesn't affect her as much, but as it stands OP pointed out an unexplained plot hole."
suits,3btjoa,coolassninjas,3,Thu Jul 2 15:39:57 2015 UTC,An unexplained plot hole? I guess you didn't read my entire post.  It's clearly explained in Jessica's title that she serves the dual function of practicing law and managing the firm. This is pretty clear and as such her prime objective is ensure the firm is run smoothly and profitably. So she's obviously different than a Senior Partner or even her named partners.  Highlighted they yes we have seen her work on cases. Again ask yourself this where do you think an Managing Partner will spend their time managing the firm or in a court room? There is a reason why her position is coveted she's essentially above having to gain billable hours or sign clients.   Again Gina Torres isn't the star of the show. Gabriel Macht and Patrick J Adams are so whose day to day do you expect to see? We've never seen Rachel actually attend a class in law school do you consider a plot hole that she hasn't flunked out?

Also I'm surprised she doesn't have a straight trust fund that she received at a certain age. Zane has to be worth millions and with obvious expertise in legal and financial matters he didn't create a trust fund for his only daughter.

Right now, it could go either way, but I still think she's going to end up with Harvey at the end of the first part of the season. Right now it's unclear with her being pissed off professionally at Louis, and personally at Harvey, but with Louis's propensity to fuck things over for himself, he's going to mess up this thing with Donna.

The fact the we have a new secretary for Harvey who'll almost bring the exact opposite of what Donna used to bring to the table, will help Harvey grow as a person emotionally and he'll see Donna in a new light, which could trigger that extra bit of courage on his part to give it a real go with Donna.

suits,3buhz4,chromiselda,9,Thu Jul 2 13:44:03 2015 UTC,"Well, Louis expected a realistic answer to be 1 zero less, which means she definitely isn't making $1000-10,000, because a zero less than that is nonsense for a top secretary in NYC. In fact even $20,000 will be a bit off. So I guess something like $40-50k a month."
suits,3buhz4,DatLe,12,Thu Jul 2 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"If this is true then Louis is just damn cheap. That's like what, 1% of his salary and he couldn't even pay it himself?  Edit: this is my estimation:  According to http://www.indeed.com/salary/Secretary.html, I would say a secretary for such a big firm would be at 30-35k range. The fact that Louis thought it should be a zero less, I think Donna was making at least 300k."
suits,3buhz4,w2user,6,Thu Jul 2 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"I would argue that, Louis was already expecting a high number and still thought there was one too many zero and she is an administrative assitant to a name partner in top level law firm, with 10+ year of experience and raises, so that average wont come anything close to what her salary should be. That's why I think Louis was expecting between 50-75k and though he could swing it, but that would make it between 500-750k which his 10% liquidity can't cover on top of his normal expense."
suits,3buhz4,redditacc2015,6,Thu Jul 2 22:32:34 2015 UTC,Only problem with a number that high is that Donna would have to be an idiot to think the firm was paying her salary simply because she knows what the other secretaries make at the firm and presumably elsewhere. If she's getting 5-10x as much then she'd know something is amiss. The extra 0 comment was probably just a throwaway line for comic relief.

Like, finding out a major character is going to die before the developments which lead to his death happen is a spoiler. It makes those events colored as you watch them happen, because you know the eventual result.  Finding out that Harvey will have a secretary named Gretchen, played by this particular actress, a day before the episode airs in which Harvey gets a secretary named Gretchen, played by this particular actress...isn't really a spoiler. When this actress (who hasn't been on the show before) walks in, it is not going to be intended as a surprise or a shock. And even if it were, there are no events building up to it, so there is no development which would be ""tainted"" in the viewer's eyes, knowing what will happen at the end of these events.  Essentially, there is a difference between a spoiler, and knowing something that will happen before it happens.

suits,3bcpbh,EddzifyBF,4,Sun Jun 28 14:57:47 2015 UTC,It is a weakness. It shows that Donna is someone he cares about and loosing her affects him and his ability to do his job. Therefore it's a weakness.

Certainly helped me sympathise much more with Harvey's character because I know exactly what that feels like. I've had the exact same thing happen to me at work and it's horrible.  Showing Harvey this way also helps reinforce that can affect anyone, it doesn't matter how confident you appear on the outside."
suits,3bcpbh,Chew55,8,Sun Jun 28 13:50:47 2015 UTC,"I know some people may argue that Harvey is like the ' cool guy ' and nothing should bother him or make him anxious but one must understand that given the circumstances and his long standing relationship with Donna ( platonic or otherwise... ) it is bound to affect him in some capacity.  Going by Korsh's interviews, it seems like this will be a recurring theme throughout the season which will help bring Harvey's past to the fore, may be his abandonment issues and why he tries to be so detached emotionally.  I think it will lead to good character growth and development for him and I'm all for it."

Running gags like this which rely on the viewer not knowing or seeing something only work because of the humor of the mystery. Finding out is never worth it (especially because in almost every case, they didn't have an idea up front and finally revealed it later, they just decided eventually to actually make something up and tell it to us). All it does is cheapen the joke.  Maris Crane never being shown on Frasier, Vera  never being shown on Cheers, The Janitor's name being a mystery on Scrubs, etc. People might think they want to find out, but it's silly. They finally reveal the Janitor's name in the end of Scrubs, and it was silly. It wasn't some magical revelation. It was just a name, and I guarantee they made it up that week (not at the beginning of the show). So what's the point? Just make up any random name in your head and that will be just as fulfilling.  The same applies here. Just make up any random crap they could do with the can opener. Done. That's about as good as it would be if they eventually ""revealed"" what they do with it (read: make something up that week and tell us that's what has been done all along)  People might think they want to know, but it wouldn't be good if we found out."

Seeing them go through dramatic experiences helps the viewer to empathise with the characters, and will keep them watching. If they kept solving a new case every week it would eventually get boring and the viewers would have no reason to come back as they wouldn't care for the characters.  Doing an episode by episode arc was good for the first season because it was just that, the first season. It's not sustainable long term. Let's be realistic here, there's only so much mileage you can get out of Mike and Harvey solving random cases on a weekly basis.   Drama isn't necessarily a problem, it's just that the writers have always gone for very unimaginative type drama. It's like you said, we all know Donna will eventually go back to Harvey. The writers love for maintaining the status quo is what makes their attempt at drama so predictable and bland for some."

suits,3b2qyd,ddrmagic,3,Fri Jun 26 07:17:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that's kind of my point. The drama the writers go for is incredibly predictable and unimaginative. The problem isn't that they go for Drama, it's that they're executing it wrong"
suits,3b2qyd,Alopolis,2,Fri Jun 26 09:53:36 2015 UTC,"When people complain about drama per se, I feel like they never watched a good drama before. The writing and execution as it happens on Suits is bad. To me, the drama often feels forced and inorganic plus after 4 seasons we know now that it won't last anyway. Good drama between characters and from the story itself needs to lead somewhere, further the plot and not lead back to the status quo after three episodes."
suits,3b2qyd,ductastic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm ok with drama too if it's well-balanced with actual cases and the law, etc. And yp, there could be a bit more variance in the type of drama presented. I completely agree as well."

suits,3b0q63,EmpyreanDraco,40,Thu Jun 25 10:02:06 2015 UTC,"Good episode to be honest, sets up quite a few new angles for the season.  I kind of wish Harvey actually took the meds and then went to go congratulate Mike. The way they did it makes it seem like the writers were in a rush to get the denial stage out of the way and have Harvey move on to a new secretary, which leads me to believe that they want to start the Louis v Harvey drama as soon as possible. I also wonder how the psychiatrist is going to play in. Maybe Harvey keeps seeing her or starts to date her and that is used to help his recovery.  Also interesting that they intentionally name dropped that senior partner (Jack Colace?). Sounds like he'll be the one giving Harvey some grief in the next few weeks."

suits,3b0q63,_Please,26,Thu Jun 25 05:06:25 2015 UTC,"And I agree, it seemed like all he had to do was walk over, ask for a list and he was all cured. The writers didn't show any progression of him getting better other than taking the blame for something that was his fault. It just seemed like he went from really anxious to cured in like 5 minutes of show time.   They told us how messed up he had been for the last 35+ minutes and then tied it all up in the last 5. We would have been more than happy with gradual progress, you didn't need to rush us through a fairly major arc of his character just to end the episode in a happy place.   I dunno, I'm rambling but they really didn't have to have everyone have a little victory at the end of that episode. Maybe it was because they wanted to have a good season opener, but we don't have to tie everything up like that."

Thought I didn't need them.  Therapist: ...   It would've been better if he took them and then he went back to her and they discussed it. Harvey's been all too cool for school since season 1 and the act is getting boring. Every character in the show has developed in some way except Harvey, and it'd be really nice to see him grow this season rather than just stay static and in denial for another season."
suits,3b0q63,simon2105,7,Fri Jun 26 17:37:54 2015 UTC,They'll have him basically use the therapist as a replacement Donna. Then he'll realize something about him wanting Donna around because blah blah blah they bang.
suits,3b0q63,chantlernz,3,Thu Jun 25 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"I thought that too, but it's basically the biggest taboo for psychiatrists to get romantically involved with a patient. They can lose their license for that and get fined a hefty amount on top. It's basically career suicide.  Of course they can do the whole ""well I won't be your patient anymore"" trope, but it's still a big stain on the psychiatrist's reputation if word ever gets out. And in terms of plot, Harvey will just be fucking the pain away and will once again be avoiding his problems."

And then the last 5 minutes an absolute turnaround. I would have loved a few more episodes of Harvey House  Also, the non-relevant parts of this felt like it could have been filler from webisodes.

First, that last saying by Mike with Harvey, ""Too soon,"" just had me laughing like crazy after the tension of that episode.  Honestly i'm not sure about Rachel being Harvey's new secretary, I mean it can work, but i'm more of a skeptic about it then anything.  I still can't get over the fact Harvey is seeing a shrink, but good overall character building for him and shows us a different angle. Harvey can open up when he needs to and when he is forced too. Although it clearly ended fast when he dumped those pills down the toilet.  Harvey's shrink though pushed all the right buttons and she was incredible and like everything else with Suits beautiful.   It's really weird seeing Donna and Lois together, but honestly it's refreshing and I'm kind of liking how it is right now. The main reason I say this is because I really want Harvey to grow without Donna and see him form a new relationship with someone that can overall also have a deep impact on him. Harvey's overall crazy character changes is fun to watch.  Jessica/Gina is truly such an amazing boss/partner/actress.   My mind is just spinning because Suits is back and I have been waiting for so long like the rest of you, can't wait for the rest of the season!!"

suits,3b0q63,est8s,3,Wed Jul 1 05:24:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of negativity but I thought this episode brought the show back to it's roots. Solid writing (imo) and great banter. Also, Donna truly leaving Harvey has been one of the biggest changes the show has made. The episode made me extremely pumped for this season!  I just watched the episode, thus my late reply haha."
suits,3b0q63,thenailpolishemoji,8,Wed Jul 1 05:31:51 2015 UTC,"Now that Donna is no longer Harvey's secretary it sets them up perfectly to start dating. Louis gets his secretary, Harvey gets Donna back in his life, Donna gets to be with the man she cares about while not having to disappoint Louis - everyone's happy."
suits,3b0q63,aabenraaper7,3,Thu Jun 25 16:26:33 2015 UTC,I'm sure Louis is gonna have a lot of jealousy over Donna dating Harvey too.

suits,3b0q63,DivineVodka,3,Thu Jun 25 05:53:37 2015 UTC,Well. I wish I could quote movies that nonchalantly off the dome...
suits,3b0q63,xxdeadshotxx,3,Thu Jun 25 20:28:48 2015 UTC,I am so fricking hyped for this season. I think there is a lot of ways this can go. Maybe we will see Mike getting partnership. Also Harvey seems to show emotions way more now. Its gonna be interesting to see where that moves to. I feel like Harvey and Mike are getting the best from eachother and becoming better lawyers because of it. Cant wait for next episode!
suits,3b0q63,Fatdig,6,Thu Jun 25 08:03:35 2015 UTC,"""These episodes will continue to last until you accept that she's not coming back.""  Few scenes later, Harvey flushes down the pills."

suits,3b0q63,lockandroll312,2,Thu Jun 25 13:25:55 2015 UTC,"FUCK I've missed this show! Much, much better than I expected."
suits,3b0q63,olhomy,2,Thu Jun 25 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"I knew Harvey wasn't going to vomit in the last scene, but the comedian in me really hoped he was about to drop trou and take a big relaxing dump"
suits,3b0q63,lockandroll312,2,Thu Jun 25 16:23:40 2015 UTC,"I thought that was a great season premiere. Harvey showed some vulnerability, which is a nice change of pace. I liked the therapist character. I hope Harvey's not magically better now that he's asked Donna for the list of candidates for a new secretary and flushed his pills down the toilet, though. (Speaking of that, it seemed like a terrible idea to flush a plastic pill container down the toilet instead of just throwing it out... Making more work for the janitor, I guess.)  I'm looking forward to seeing where this season goes. Hopefully it doesn't just retread old ground."
suits,3b0q63,DickbuttCheney,4,Thu Jun 25 22:11:34 2015 UTC,WTF is happening to Harvey Spector? Just hired a new secretary for christ sake! Sorry but IMO this show is getting too melodramatic for me. I'll stick with it because of the love that I have for season 1&2 but I'm extremely disappointed with how the storyline goes.
suits,3b0q63,rafessi,3,Fri Jun 26 00:17:06 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU! This is a man who has faced prison time for the shady shit he's done, and he gets panic attacks because his former secretary has moved down the hall? Get the fuck out of here."
suits,3b0q63,_AMPLiFY,2,Tue Jun 30 14:48:40 2015 UTC,Right? I'd be fine with it if this is a comedy show.
suits,3b0q63,xVIRIDISx,2,Thu Jun 25 21:52:47 2015 UTC,Yes! The quips between Harvey and  Mike are in full force!
suits,3b0q63,rustinthewind,3,Fri Jun 26 04:42:20 2015 UTC,"Amazing episode, and some really heavy stuff there with Harvey. And what I really like about Suits is it resolves stuff within an episode. Harvey started the episode in deep denial and ended it with acceptance ( well not completely but he's well on his way I think ), no heavy drama there, just back to business as usual.  I'm really looking forward to how the Donna-Louis thing develops, has the potential for some awesome exchanges.   I know some people are expecting Donna to come  back and work for Harvey in the near future, but I'm gonna say that it probably won't happen this season, or if it does, won't happen before near the end of the season.  The only negative from this episode- Mike's new hairstyle.  Quote of the episode - "" And he's not thinking about sex right now """
suits,3b0q63,hwu,3,Fri Jun 26 10:06:47 2015 UTC,"Well after that lackluster fourth season, I gota say that this episode was awesome! Hopefully we'll see some more like this to come."
suits,3b0q63,Peanutbutta33,3,Thu Jun 25 01:28:47 2015 UTC,"The only thing that bugs me is how quickly the show plows through important plot lines and draws out unimportant ones.   Harvey had panic attacks and anxiety problems for 45 minutes, but I feel like that could've helped the next couple episode but now there's no continuing plot to carry into the next episode. All the plot lines ended so they'll have to restart next episode kind of"
suits,3b0q63,DMann420,5,Thu Jun 25 18:59:33 2015 UTC,I don't think he is done with them. He was having an attack as he flushed the pills. It seems like it was his first step towards moving on. The panic attacks will come into play as this half season continues.
suits,3b0q63,veritasxe,4,Thu Jun 25 03:01:05 2015 UTC,completely agree. i think there will be more visits to the shrink though. he's not gonna get over donna that easily.
suits,3b0q63,Peanutbutta33,2,Thu Jun 25 04:25:38 2015 UTC,I get that the writers are really trying to sell this Harvey/Donna angle but the way they are going about it is pretty shitty. These are all high-powered professionals but they act like a bunch of middle schoolers over a damn inter-office transfer.
suits,3b0q63,haoareyoudoing,12,Thu Jun 25 05:08:57 2015 UTC,"Well, they've been together for 12 years and she has pretty much run his life the entire time. He's hasn't had a different secretary since right before he left the DA's Office."
suits,3b0q63,Peanutbutta33,9,Thu Jun 25 05:13:12 2015 UTC,"I work in a law firm as a summer associate and I can confirm lawyers (and paralegals/clerks) act like middle schoolers. The amount of politics, back biting and drama is unreal. I think most people don't quite grasp how much stress in involved with running a legal practice and that when you put a bunch of Type A personalities into the same building, you'll get drama regardless of level of education etc. just people of the personality of the people drawn to the field."
suits,3b0q63,buckybarnesleftarm,2,Thu Jun 25 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"I get drama, back-biting, office politics, but for a top litigator to come apart over an inter-office transfer. Season 2 Donna was fired Harvey wasn't happy about it but he functioned fine."
suits,3b0q63,kajunkennyg,7,Thu Jun 25 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah but when Donna got fired, he knew he would do whatever it took to get her back. Now she's working for Louis, his ""foe"", and on her own accord and she's not coming back, and doesn't want to. It wasn't just an interoffice transfer, it was a bitter pause to their relationship, in which their true colors were out. Donna wanted more, but Harvey thought it was good enough for now. Plus when you no longer got the worlds best secretary handling your stuff since day 1, you'd be lucky to even be disorganized."
suits,3b0q63,DMann420,3,Thu Jun 25 05:30:30 2015 UTC,"Jessica fired Donna for destroying exculpatory evidence and Jessica was fighting for control of the firm with Hardman. Harvey wasn't fighting to bring Donna back he was fighting for Jessica's control of the firm.   Like I said I get why the writers went with this storyline but turning a work-obsessed, high powered, pitbull of an attorney, into an emotional wreck over Donna working for Louis just seems way over the top. From some of the interviews it doesn't seem like this will be the end of Harvey's downward spiral."
suits,3b0q63,we4lty,6,Thu Jun 25 08:03:33 2015 UTC,"But Donna didn't choose to leave him in season 2.   Harvey's issues seem to be related to being abandoned by the people he loves, which has happened a lot recently (in his mind). That hadn't happened yet in season 2, so he reacted differently.   His reaction after Donna leaving isn't an overreaction to this, it's essentially the straw that broke the camel's back. In Harvey's mind almost everyone close to him has left (Mike leaving to work for the investment banker, Scotty leaving, Donna leaving) and that makes him anxious.   That's what I took from the episode."
suits,3b0q63,LinLeaf,2,Thu Jun 25 08:40:54 2015 UTC,what's with the voice over? Am I the only one getting it?
suits,3b0q63,shawcable,7,Thu Jun 25 12:44:28 2015 UTC,You talking about the Buffalo Bill reference? I thought it sounded kind of voiced over as well. It's pretty hard to mimic Ted Levine's voice.. They either make it sound really close or absolutely terrible.

suits,3b22cc,Kromherjan,2,Thu Jun 25 16:38:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm not concerned about the cardboard but the pills themselves. Never ever trash or flush down unused medication - ESPECIALLY psychoactive drugs.   We dont want that in our water system. It's a non-trivial health hazard to the general population, and creates undesired tolerance over extended periods of time in the general population.  If you live in a civilized country, any pharmacy is obligated by law to take back unused pills without asking questions for safe destruction. Here, they're not even allowed to keep records of such things to ensure nobody has any incentive of doing it otherwise."

suits,3b3i3l,crypticlunatic,2,Thu Jun 25 17:47:30 2015 UTC,I sort of wished they hadn't shown Harvey accept Donna's move. It's one of the few times they went further with Harvey's character than witty humor and comebacks.

suits,3b1nyy,GetMoneySmokeWeed,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"Let me just say this: NOBODY ever in the media industry has a ""long term plan"" for TV projects. I mean, Better Call Saul is the longest I've ever seen a season that hasn't aired yet be confirmed for, and that's only 2 seasons. Meghan isn't a producer, she didn't have a long term contract until much later on so chances are: it just happens.   Not sure if you've ever written anything for the media industry, but names are important - they can't be too flashy, they've got to have a ring to it without having a ring to it. It was most likely a fluke.   Sorry if you feel like I'm raging at you, it's just my way of explaining things."
suits,3b1nyy,Alopolis,3,Thu Jun 25 22:12:00 2015 UTC,"Well you're right in the sense that the writers probably didn't have a route planned out for each and every character. However, I'd be surprised if they didn't have a general idea of how their stories would end. From the pilot, where Mike said the ""wow you're pretty"" and Rachel shutting him down, it was clear to me that Rachel and Mike would be the show's main romantic couple/storyline. They set it up to look like a challenge and a will they or won't they story."

suits,3b1myd,Eidbanger,7,Thu Jun 25 06:17:34 2015 UTC,"You're not alone in that inquiry. Remember when Mike's photographic memory was the only reason he would even associate with Harvey's firm? I don't think I've heard his memory referenced since Season 2 or 3.  That's why I watched it. It was a classic ""Taste of the good life"" relationship between a down on his luck genius being taken under the wing of a very intelligent and successful mentor.  Now, Mike and Harvey's secret is pretty much known by the principal cast with no real consequences, the threat of Mike being found out has been has been played every season with no outcome to the point that when it finally does happen, it'll be just that: ""FINALLY!"" Also, with the absence of Mike's memory being mentioned and him finally being successful enough to actually live the good life, there really is no where else to go.  The show refuses to provide real consequences so they must rely on relationship drama to push the story forward. In no way is this a bad thing for the show to do because it seems like that is what the current fan base demands. However, it cannot be argued that this show did provide more when it started, but that time has come and gone."
suits,3b1myd,olhomy,5,Fri Jun 26 20:09:03 2015 UTC,"Easy the writers started listening to fans unfortunately not all the are Darvey fans. Six main characters and four of them engaged or involved in relationship drama you only see that on Soap Operas, CW network, or sitcoms."

suits,3ay669,jjgoon,11,Wed Jun 24 13:17:33 2015 UTC,"I already miss the effortless flow of the Harvey/Donna banter but I hope Louis/Donna-hilariousness will make up for it! Also, it'll be really interesting to see the fragile side of Harvey, dealing with his abandonment issues and finally growing as a character.  For predictions... well... Louis will eventually screw things up with Donna, but I don't think Harvey and Donna will get together until the last episode of this show and even then it might be a bit ambiguous."

suits,3ay669,Juicewag,5,Thu Jun 25 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"Louis will almost certainly be the main antagonist (heel) for the first part of season 5. You can guarantee he will flaunt Donna in Harvey's face. I highly doubt we'll go back to the case of the week style they had in season 1. I can see the writers using cases as a mechanism to highlight how lost Harvey is without Donna by showing Harvey making mistakes on his cases, or struggling to get through his workload but I doubt it's going to go back to Mike and Harvey picking up a random case and solving it in an episode.   Harvey and Donna getting together could go either way really. Aside from the last half of season 4, the writers didn't give us that much reason to believe it was a possibility. Compare that to Rachel and Mike who were pretty much flirting from episode 1 and a romantic attraction was always there. I think the writers could easily go either way with Harvey and Donna. That being said, I'm pretty confident that Donna will be back as Harvey's secretary by the end of season 5A.  Mike and Robert Zane will be working together and I can see the writers going for the easy option where RZ almost finds out Mike's secret. Maybe they go out together and RZ asks him about Harvard or introduces Mike to some Harvard friends of his, that sort of routine. I'm pretty certain that the writers won't pass up that opportunity for some (cheap/old) drama. Whether he finds out or not is up in the air. With Robert being a recurring character, I doubt they will go that far."

suits,3ay669,flashdude64,3,Wed Jun 24 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"She won't be Donna. If you look at the episode in season 2 where Donna was fired and Harvey had to use a temp, you could see that Donna was more than a secretary to Harvey.   Harvey isn't going to miss Donna purely for her secretarial skills. Donna understood Harvey and vice versa. That's not a relationship you can just find again quickly."

suits,3ay669,Darewaves,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:06:24 2015 UTC,"Predictions:   Louis vs. Harvey  Louis is the one who accidentally discovers Harvey's anxiety problems but doesn't connect the pieces. Donna discovers Harvey's problems through Louis's dictaphone. Donna tries to help Harvey but Harvey rejects it.   Louis realizes that returning Donna to Harvey is best for the firm and that happens somehow.   Harvey &/vs. Harvey's Mom?  Harvey's Mom is the source of Harvey's abandonment issues that causes his anxiety.  It'd be interesting if there was a (pro bono?) case with a client with similar issues or the client is Harvey's Mom.  Mike &/vs. Harvey  As Mike becomes a young Harvey, we'll see a power struggle emerge between them. With Harvey dealing with emotions, Mike will grow into a Harvey (conflict wit Rachel) but realize he has limitations ( ""THE SECRET"", marriage ) and find a balance.   Donna &/vs. Harvey  Honestly, I would love for Harvey and Donna to get together. But if they do, it's uncharted territory for both of them that scares them back into the old Harvey-Donna  relationship. OR they overcome it (regulations about relationships between boss and employee) because they are Harvey and Donna.   Harvey vs. Harvey  Harvey becoming more badass.   Jessica & Pearson Specter Litt vs. ?????  Now that the Jeff is out of the picture, I'd like to see Jessica's focus back on work. Not just ordering or listening to people, but I'd like to see Jessica doing something unexpected (take a case for Harvey????)."

suits,3b0x04,Kl3rik,2,Thu Jun 25 09:54:49 2015 UTC,I don't get what everyones problem is   I think the problem people are having is that Suits has become a Wednesday night soap opera with the same drama week in and week out.  It's the least interesting part about the show.  How many times can we ride this carousel?
suits,3b0x04,HeyZuesHChrist,3,Thu Jun 25 17:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you have to go somewhere with the show. You can't just do the whole ""Mike getting caught"" or ""Crazy big case! Mike and Harvey have one liners! Mike and Harvey are in a pickle""...last 30 seconds ""Mike finds something that wins the case...Hooray"" for every episode."
suits,3b0x04,SANPELLIGRIN0,2,Thu Jun 25 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with that.  That's honestly what I like about the show.  When shows start getting into relationships and relationship drama I usually just peace out.  My favorite TV show of all time is Stargate SG:1.  Do you know how many relationships they had in that show?  None.  Over ten seasons it was never about relationships and drama.    My second favorite show is Stargate Atlantis.  Again, after five seasons it had nothing to do with relationships.    It can be done and it can be done well."
suits,3b0x04,HeyZuesHChrist,0,Thu Jun 25 18:52:25 2015 UTC,"I hear you, and that's what drew me in at first - the dialogue is hilarious. I'm just saying that this show's dialogue and characters likable and they could add a little more story or substance to the show. I think the last few seasons were a little overkill in the relationship department though, so I side with you a little there.  But too much of the last minute rescues makes the show have no plot at all and it becomes like CSI or something, in that you never have to keep up because every episode is more or less independent."
suits,3b0x04,SANPELLIGRIN0,0,Thu Jun 25 18:55:51 2015 UTC,"I would love for them to serialize it.  You have a main arc (some sort of main issue or antagonist) throughout the season where each episode works towards solving that problem, while each episode also solves a ""problem of the week.""  A lot of shows have done this very, very well.  Burn Notice was fucking awesome at this formula.  They always wrapped up the problem of the week early enough that the last ~10 minutes of the show was dedicated to Michael focusing on the larger arc.  Veronica Mars was perfect with this as well."
suits,3b0x04,HeyZuesHChrist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:02:22 2015 UTC,"I guess what I don't like is the problem for 29:30 and 0:30 solution + high fives. I'm not against them never failing, it's just the way it happens that I don't like.  It's like a roller coaster that climbs the whole show, and then drops quick at the end. I just want to see some twists and loops man!"
suits,3b0x04,SANPELLIGRIN0,0,Thu Jun 25 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm all for the twists and loops.  I'm not against them failing at times, and at the end of the episode there simply is no solution and they lose.  I think that would make it more interesting, not knowing if it's always going to work out.  Do you know who did this very well?  Law & Order.  Did they win most of the time?  Yes.  But sometimes they didn't.  And sometimes they tied/nobody won.  I've always thought that was the most compelling part of the original Law & Order."
suits,3b0x04,HeyZuesHChrist,2,Thu Jun 25 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"There was definitely symbolism that he's ""good to go"" or ""right as rain"" now. Flushing the pills, the music, going to the Nets game with Mike, and so on. Just felt like a let down after the majority of the episode was centered around Harvey's panic/anxiety attacks and him seeking help for it. Still a good episode - you can never really expect too much from a season premiere unfortunately, but this episode felt like it would have panned out better if Suits episodes were ~60 minutes or so."
suits,3b0x04,motivate18,2,Thu Jun 25 06:41:29 2015 UTC,This. Totally agreed. An hour episode or maybe 2-3 episodes worth. There are few glimpses at Harvey's actual life versus the alpha male machismo he tries to always show.

Maybe it's because I don't really care whether she works for Harvey or Louis. Change is inevitable and she's always been by his side, but the cases themselves and clever quips are what got me into the show in the first place. It's understandable though and I like we got to see Harvey's vulnerability, but there's so many other storylines I would have started the season off with instead."

Yahoo, a new player in the TV game, allowed Community to say ""fuck"" a few times during this past (perhaps final) season.  The FFC is a pain in the ass about swear words, and then there's also the problem of Advertisers who might pull out if they're not comfortable with the content in the script.

suits,39yru7,Peanutbutta33,2,Tue Jun 16 10:34:59 2015 UTC,Suits is really intent on pushing this Harvey/Donna storyline. They have opportunity to do something surprising where Donna moves on but instead of Harvey behaving like a broken-hearted teenager he actually evolves and respects Donna for moving on. Donna does in fact move on with her life and is no longer Harvey centric (holding a candle for him to finally pursue a serious relationship).
suits,39yru7,westerling,6,Tue Jun 16 08:34:32 2015 UTC,It would be stupid of the writers not to milk it: People love Harvey and Donna - every post Suits makes about them on social media practically gets twice as much attention as any other stuff.
suits,39yru7,harumscarum1991,4,Tue Jun 16 12:03:23 2015 UTC,Let's just hope the writers don't ruin Harvey x Donna before they really even begin....that is my biggest fear.
suits,39yru7,Peanutbutta33,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:38:03 2015 UTC,See Rachel x Mike and the popularity of that relationship. I just think romantic relationships isn't the this show's writers strong suit.
suits,39yru7,harumscarum1991,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:01:05 2015 UTC,I don't even know what's worse: the writers making Harvey x Donna another boring couple on the show (though i find it hard to believe they'd be quite as boring) or the writers spending this whole season and possibly another one creating new reasons for Harvey and Donna to not be together yet continue pining for each other. The former would be bad but I think the second could be much worse and by the time they do get together hardly anyone will actually be happy about it.
suits,39yru7,Peanutbutta33,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:40:32 2015 UTC,Well look at the ratings from season 1 and 2 where the Harvey/Donna was much more toned down. Judging from the nearly nonexistent promotion it seems that USA is about ready to put the show out to pasture. So if the Donna/Harvey storyline was so well received I think the show would be doing better overall. The attention this storyline gets on social media is probably because Harvey/Donna shippers are the only fans left that haven't stopped watching the show. I didn't watch Suits when it first came on but I do remember USA was promoting the hell out of it and Suits at least in the beginning became the networks flagship show.   We're a week out and hardly have seen any promotions.
suits,39yru7,westerling,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:23:06 2015 UTC,"Harvey/Donna was not exactly toned down in season 2. Anyways, the ""Nielsen ratings"" have gone down yes, maybe because people got tired of the formula (it happens all the time with TV-shows) - or maybe just because they changed the air time... but honestly I don't think it's a big deal.   The way we watch TV is changing, people DVR stuff nowadays. If I remember correctly Suits still does great when you factor in 7-day viewing. I myself live in Sweden and can't exactly watch it in the middle of the night..."
suits,39yru7,Peanutbutta33,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"Season 2 we saw Harvey pursue Zoey and she was the one that got away. And the season ended with him falling back into bed with Scotty which eventually busted up. So I'm not sure what you mean by Harvey/Donna not being toned down. Harvey was pursuing and dating other women for most of the season. The rest of the season Harvey in the trenches with Jessica trying to beat back Hardman.  Suits is on a network if it was on one of the streaming services I would agree about people various viewing habits being a bigger factor. But television 101 less viewers = less advertisements= less money for the network. Even discounting the financial aspect there are other factors that could help a show survive critical success and cult following.   Another show I watch Hannibal has so so ratings for a major network. Watching one episode you see very quickly why it wouldn't be a hit show on a major network. But there is a dedicated fanbase and the show has been very well-received by the critics. So I can see NBC choosing to look beyond Nielsen ratings. Suits doesn't really have that X factor and USA seems to be going through a re-branding.  From the lack of promos, the constant changing of season start dates, changing of days/time I think the blood is in the water. Now maybe there will be some type resurgence but I don't think DVR viewings will be enough to save the show if it's ratings continue to decline or remain low."
suits,39yru7,westerling,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"S2 had the whole memo-arch and Donna was trying to help Harvey with both Zoey and Scottie, not really that big of a change from S3 or S4 (minus the 2 last S4 episodes) so I don't see how that would factor in on the ratings.   Suits is on Netflix in loads of other countries. I've watched it in Sweden, UK, Germany and on a plane to Australia. I think it's also on Amazon Prime in the US? It has a pretty big fanbase too and I find it cool that loads of pro athletes follow it (as evident by the cameos.) Seeing how I'm not in the US I really have no idea about advertisment or re-branding, I'm just saying it's a lot more popular than the ratings make it out to be and I'm really hoping we get a S6 (unsure if it should stretch out longer than that, there's only so far we can go with the Fraud-premise.)"
suits,39yru7,Peanutbutta33,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:24:26 2015 UTC,"Season 2 they still were doing new cases nearly every episode. Whereas season 3 was all about Hessington oil. Tons of shows are on either Netflix or Amazon in the U.S. the real money is in syndication.    My entire point is that American television (I mention because I have no idea how other countries might do it) but a show on a network it's all about money. If a show isn't generating revenue for a network it won't be on the air simple as that unless there is some special circumstances involved.   Thinking about another show on a cable network. Walking Dead which is shown here in the U.S. on AMC they have similar schedule to Suits in that they split the seasons up into two parts. Walking Dead is already syndicated, there are a shit ton of very active online communities, and you can almost guarantee that when it's about to premiere even if you don't watch a single second of AMC there will be tons of advertising. It's the type of show you can walk into work or school the next day, it's almost guarantee someone will be talking about last night's episode."
suits,39yru7,TheQueen-Persephone,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:29:03 2015 UTC,"In many a circumstance, to keep a television series on the air, they would have to give the audience what they desire. Show them, give them, anything, so they may have something to look forward to. After all; audience = ratings = money."
suits,39yru7,Peanutbutta33,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:11:42 2015 UTC,You keep making the point that Donna/Harvey is what the audience wants but if the overall ratings are down how is this correct? What I mean is that I'm picking random numbers but if Suits rating during season 1 and 2 were 4.3 million and now the ratings are 2.5 million it's obvious that many viewers have stopped watching the show. So picking a storyline from the recent seasons does not really point to increased ratings of the overall ratings are down.  So yes among the viewers left watching there is interest but that means nothing if the ratings are dropping.
suits,39yru7,TheQueen-Persephone,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:57:39 2015 UTC,"Well, that is simply because they have yet to give the Donna and Harvey relationship in which the audience crave in order to skyrocket the ratings again (or hopefully so). By the way, if you had fully comprehended my post you will realise I did not say their relationship would be the sole and only factor which would bring in the increased ratings."
suits,39yru7,Peanutbutta33,0,Tue Jun 16 17:44:30 2015 UTC,I can't tell if you're joking? It's kind of bizarre to think a storyline that wasn't present during the successful seasons would lead to a turnaround in ratings. The show's original promotion centered on the bromance btw Harvey and Mike. I think that relationship attracted people in the beginning. But as Suits went in different directions and has placed that central relationship on the backburner I think this is where the decrease in ratings stem from and overall interest.

suits,39yru7,Peanutbutta33,5,Tue Jun 16 12:21:32 2015 UTC,"Come on there are fans that would watch even if the show was watching Gabriel Macht read from a phone book. Plus the fashion on Suits is probably some of the best on television. I think you dismiss superficial reasons far to easily. There is a reason Harvey Specter isn't played by a fat, old, balding guy. And why all the women are beautiful and have incredible figures, hair, make-up, and style."
suits,39yru7,TheQueen-Persephone,0,Tue Jun 16 13:31:57 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ, even off the top of my head I could think of numerous other television series with just as good, if not better fashion. It was not a dismissal, rather stating they would hardly be sufficient motivational factors. In fact, there have been many cases in which the protagonist was hardly handsome and yet the show thrived."
suits,39yru7,Peanutbutta33,3,Tue Jun 16 15:08:09 2015 UTC,Let me be a little clearer I'm not pointing to Suits as the standard for all television shows. Plenty of successful shows with both commercial and critical praise deviate from Suits formula of a handsome leading man or beautiful leading lady. But it doesn't negate Suits tries to appeal to the audiences more aesthetic sensibilities. Let's be real look at the stretch of believability of the show's premise surely people aren't tuning to gain a realistic presentation of the legal world.
suits,39yru7,TheQueen-Persephone,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:05:15 2015 UTC,"Hardly, there were far more interesting factors beyond merely aesthetics and law, which kept the audience adamantly attached during Season 1 and Season 2. In fact, I dare say it was the rhythm of the well written banter between characters that brought on the fierce attraction."
suits,39yru7,Peanutbutta33,2,Tue Jun 16 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"Yea but quoting movie references will only get you so far. The banter has almost disappeared in favor of more ""dramatic"" interactions.

suits,38rx03,Checkerszero,12,Mon Jun 8 10:00:57 2015 UTC,"So last season we had a Mike Rachel Logan love triangle, and now this season we're going to have a Louis Donna Harvey triangle. I think this is what's going to take up the most of season 5 part A and will boil down to Donna having to choose between Harvey and Louis.  The Mike/Rachel thing is probably minor. It looks like Rachel was keeping something secret from him. Mike doesn't look that pissed off at her. So they'll probably resolve it pretty quickly.   So yeah, my bet is that Harvey starts out the season under pressure, struggling to adapt to the lack of Donna and Louis is going to be the antagonist for the first part of the season."
suits,38rx03,Alopolis,16,Sat Jun 6 13:10:00 2015 UTC,"Ugh... What I fear is that you're right. And if you are, that sounds really boring."

suits,38rx03,Hyper_,3,Mon Jun 8 16:28:43 2015 UTC,"You can't really compare it to the Mike-Rachel-Logan thing though. Rachel and Logan are essentially quite boring characters, but the interaction between Louis-Donna/Donna-Harvey/Harvey-Louis has always been one of the funniest parts of the show so I'm pretty sure I'm going to enjoy the banter that comes with this twist."
suits,38rx03,Alopolis,5,Sat Jun 6 14:55:40 2015 UTC,"Well it's going to come down to how they write it really. Like I said earlier, Donna is most likely going to have to choose between Harvey and Louis, and I hope it doesn't go down the road where Harvey realises his true feelings and they get together, Donna leaves Louis and the status quo is restored.   The writers have Mike and Rachel for a happily ever after, I hope they try something different."
suits,38rx03,Alopolis,3,Sat Jun 6 15:06:40 2015 UTC,"True that it comes down to the writing, but they've been throwing that ""don't shit where you eat""-thing around for a long time now. Donna leaving Harvey professionally opens up the romantic aspect of their relationship and if they go down that road I don't think she'll be working for him at the same time.   (Though that's something I'm not expecting until the end of the show tbh)"
suits,38rx03,NickRick,5,Sat Jun 6 15:19:42 2015 UTC,"Well, if you look at this show, the only workplace relationship that's actually worked out is Mike and Rachel. Jeff and Jessica didn't work out and Harvey and Scotty didn't work out. Both relationships failed because one partner outstripped the other in terms of ranks and because of that couldn't be truthful with their partner. Neither Harvey or Jessica told their partner about Mike and that's what eventually broke up both relationships.  Now looking at it that way, Donna already knows about Mike, so Harvey and Donna wouldn't have that problem, but they do have another one. With Donna working for Louis, it would be very difficult for them to make a relationship work. Louis and Harvey will likely be going up against each other alot this season, and it would be a conflict for Donna. She would have to choose between her professional relationship with Louis, or her romantic relationship with Harvey. For Harvey and Donna to actually work out romantically, I think they'd have to work with each other. Or at the very least, Donna would have to not work for Louis."
suits,38rx03,Alopolis,0,Sat Jun 6 15:36:04 2015 UTC,"To have another story where Louis gets betrayed and somehow is the bad guy again.  I'm gonna stop watching if that happens.  To me Louis is the only character who isn't an asshole and he has real feelings.  He was always pushed aside because people like Harvey out shine him,  despite that he keeps going and is a great lawyer. I hate that they keep trying to make him a bad guy just because they can't think of a better arch, it'sjust lazy writing."
suits,38rx03,SpareLiver,3,Sun Jun 7 00:35:33 2015 UTC,"Louis has always been in Harvey's shadow. That has been made clear since episode 1 when Harvey made senior partner before him. Louis has always been just as much of an asshole as the rest of the characters, the only difference is that Louis rarely gets a chance to express that vindictive side of him. When he does get the chance, he's shown that he's just as much of an asshole as the rest of them. Look at the way he treated Mike, Donna and Rachel in the second half of season 4 after he found out about Mike's secret. He was just as much of an asshole as everyone else when given the chance. The only difference is that Louis has a tendency to shoot himself in the foot 5 minutes after he gains any sort of leverage.   I can guarantee this season will have Louis flaunting the fact that he has Donna working for him and rubbing it in Harvey's face. He's got some real leverage over Harvey and I can guarentee you he will spend a lot of time making sure Harvey knows that."

suits,37ts04,7L2,8,Sat May 30 09:18:50 2015 UTC,"Mike asked Harold to file a lawsuit on behalf of witnesses against Ava Hessington. They then settled the suit and handed the witnesses were paid a settlement and thus were not able to testify against Ava. It was a pay off, but a legal pay off as Mike put it.   Mike and Harold got arrested because the whole thing was done within a day according to Quelling. Two kids who used to work together and went to law school together, worked a case against each other that was settled within 1 day. It probably looked very suspicious for anyone bothering to investigate it."

suits,37mw1u,ChiefInStaff,29,Thu May 28 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"There was a out given by Harvey. With Mike going small time and helping people which is what he wanted and with a lower risk but he's not interested in that. They more or less retcon every big move or change every half season so everyone is more or less where they were after a few episodes.   Its moving away from the legal smarts and becoming about gamechanging one hit kills. It was a great series but for it to move forward Mike has to be found out and move on, he can survive without it. Become a lecturer or special consultant or something.   Personally, I'd like Hardman to return, he was a real big bad and while he played dirty, he used people just as much as they did. I'd like to see a real game of chess between him and the others."
suits,37mw1u,tinhtinh,7,Thu May 28 21:31:05 2015 UTC,"Bringing back Hardman would be a great idea. He made a great villain of sorts. Although I found him infuriating to watch at times, he was captivating and is the biggest threat Jessica/Harvey have faced."

I watched Suits after Breaking Bad and was sitting there trying to wrap my head around Gale Boetticher being a bad guy, and now everytime that I see David Costabile acting, I just imagine Daniel Hardman. Such a great actor, he really is. I'd love for Tanner and Hardman to take one last crack at Harvey, mainly because I love David and Eric Close."

A lawless neutral to add some pull factors for Harvey's lawful neutral to shift alignments. However the actor was, well, just bad."

suits,37mw1u,rafessi,9,Fri May 29 14:04:44 2015 UTC,"I think it will last for 2 more seasons max, and quite honestly, I would like to see the show back to an episode by episode arc rather than a seasonal arc which ends up going nowhere.  I think the first 2 seasons were high quality because every episode was basically a standalone with new cases, I think a show like Suits benefits from that, rather than just 1 long story that covers the entire season.  Plus, if they can get away from the soapy romantic stuff and get back to law again, it would be better for whatever is remaining of the show.  Mike;s secret thing has become tiresome, in fact I think they missed a trick when Mike left the law firm, they should have followed up on that story and tried to create a rivalry of sorts between him and Harvey, could have made for some compelling drama, and some nice change of pace from the usual stuff."

There's only so much mileage they can get out of Mike being a fraud and his secret getting found out.   With them killing off the investment banking angle, they eliminated any chance of Mike's story ending nicely, any ending from now on would have to require Mike facing charges for it to be slightly believable IMO. There's no way Mike walks away voluntarily."

The show runner Aaron Korch has another USA show in the works...Suits could just be biting time.  I'd like to see Mike take the fall or walk away. Seems like everyone he's come in contact with has lost something or had to give something up for him to get to this point. He's the only one that gains something."

suits,37mw1u,frvnkenstein,2,Fri May 29 16:23:36 2015 UTC,"I think a possible ending to the show would be Mike being put in front of the Bar Association, and beating all of them in his ""Game of Knowledge of the Law"" (the same one he beat both Harvey AND* Jessica in).

I imagine that would explain the lack of promo and why this will probably be the last season of Suits.
suits,3754vi,enterthecircus,8,Mon May 25 01:37:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's too bad, cause USA made it's first scratch when them managed to popularize the 'bromance'. White Collar, Suits, Burn Notice, Royal Pains, Psych, etc. They were all (with the loose inclusion of Royal Pains) built upon a mano-mano central relationship. And I really liked that refreshing difference from most other shows.   That being said, I'm wondering if they're going to try to horn into TNT's turf. Could make for some impressive dramas put out by both. Which is always good, cause SouthLand, Major Crimes and even L&O: LA are excellent shows."

Thank God White Collar didn't get that dark, even though the creator wanted it to.  The Blue Sky filter was my favorite thing about USA Network :("

suits,374190,Hades_Re,2,Sun May 24 17:57:47 2015 UTC,Those are scores from people who go to the trouble of rating tv shows on  imdb.com which is probably a small segment of tv viewers.  I'm going to guess the ratings you read about were referring to the total number of viewers.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_(TV_series)#Ratings
suits,374190,tylerdurden2000,2,Sun May 24 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"It's also tough because they've changed the day/time around, and also time of year. Thursday at 10 had the highest ratings, Wednesday at 9 the lowest. Is it the show quality declining? The plot is stale? The time/day slot is wrong? Did they not promote enough?  So many things could contribute."
suits,374190,wagedomain,3,Mon May 25 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"Suits is actually quite popular here in Sweden and in the UK, but people watch it on sites like Netflix (or download it, sadly)."
suits,374190,westerling,2,Mon May 25 19:44:51 2015 UTC,I've always been confused by the way that timeslots/days affect the U.S. TV system. They hardly have any impact in the UK
suits,374190,zenz3ro,-1,Thu Jun 11 00:53:52 2015 UTC,"One reason is timezones. UK has 1. US has 4 (technically 6 but I'm not counting Hawaii/Alaska for simplicity). This means we split our TV in half - Eastern/Central (the two eastern most timezones) and Mountain/Pacific (the two western timezones). So if a show is at 9PM what does that mean? It means 9PM Eastern/8PM Central Time. You think this would mean they shift for 9PM/8PM Mountain/Pacific but this is not the case, they actually shift 3 hours often to air it in Pacific at the same time as Eastern.  This means Mountain gets a bit shafted - they either have to watch an hour later or the Eastern feed (2 hours earlier). This is weird for when people watch.  There are also, besides timezones, regular patterns that can affect viewers. Friday night not as many people are at home watching TV. Shows on the weekends typically do poorly. And so on.  Another big BIG contribution is competing shows. For example, the comedy show Community was put on Thursday at 8PM because network executives think ""oh, Big Bang Theory is a comedy juggernaut at 8PM so we should put our best comedy on at the same time!"" This makes no sense to normal people, but remember that network executives are  actually secret lizard people and TV is just an experiment to try and understand the human mind (so far they are failing but they're getting much much better).   So Community goes up against this juggernaut of a show Thursday at 8PM. Then CBS gets the rights to Thursday Night football or whatever it's called. They put this on instead of Big Bang Theory at 8PM and now the network lizards are like ""wait now there's no comedy competition at 8PM on Thursday night"". Instead of realizing like any RATIONAL human being would that people who still want to watch a comedy at 8PM on Thursdays now have less options, thus more people will watch their show, they promptly cancel Community. Then it was picked up by Yahoo! Screen which is an internet video service that exists solely to serve Community and also a bunch of shitty content that auto-plays while you're trying to get to the next episode of Community.   This is, once again, the work of the lizard people experimenting with a new medium. ""Oh they've just watched episode 4 of a 13 episode season? Let's play them a video of an awkward nerd mumbling into the camera about the latest rollercoaster and how scary it looks."" Lizard logic. Sane rational people know that they should play episode 5. Also, when you first go to Yahoo! Screen and click ""Community"" it started on episode 1 every. single. time.  Point is, particularly with network television (which Suits is not) there's this very fragile struggle between warring lizard factions trying desperately to crack the human mind first by providing competing multi-cam sitcoms."

The show needs story and character arcs, and needs to begin heading towards a grand finale.  If this season is a lazy cut & paste of Season 4 I highly doubt we'll get a 6th season."

I have met someone who was in her 40's in my first internship and she was pretty much a Donna but maybe 1 or 2 levels less ""awesome"". A lot of the appeal of Donna comes from her emotional intelligence. When you are very smart in understanding how people are different and how they react to certain behaviours, you become very comfortable in your ability to have relationships with others and in return makes you extremely confident. Confidence comes from your interaction with others and your ability to make yourself vulnerable. Donna is a clear example of how to be vulnerable with what we have seen so far in her relationships with Harvey, Mike, Luis and Rachel. If you are able to do that, you will quickly learn how to be confident."

suits,343xsd,Goftrey,3,Wed Jun 24 01:12:23 2015 UTC,"I genuinely think the whole Mike as an investment banker had way more potential than the half-arsed first part of a season that the writers gave it. The dynamic between Mike & Harvey on opposing sides was really good at times, but nothing really came of it and come episode 9(?) things were back to how they were at S03E15. The second half of the season similarly had potential. I was genuinely a little worried when Louis pieced together Mike's secret, but again, the writers failed to grow a pair of bollocks, the relationships were patched up and again we're pretty much back to where we were at the end of season 3.  A lot happened in season 4, but there were no real consequences or knock on effects going forward. That's what made it suck.  And judging by the season 5 plot, it's going to be more of the same this time round. The show needs some progression now. It's beginning to remind me of what happened to Dexter post season 4."

suits,342v80,smittywjmj1,3,Tue Apr 28 01:41:32 2015 UTC,"Semi-related question for anybody who knows: I've always wondered, why is there a requirement that you attend law school in order to take the bar? If somebody like Mike existed in real life and knew the material without having gone to law school, why couldn't he take the bar and just be a licensed, self-trained lawyer?"
suits,342v80,iheartgt,15,Mon Apr 27 22:07:55 2015 UTC,The reasoning is that law school is supposed to provide more practical training. Just like how you can't be a CPA without accounting degrees. Being able to take one test doesn't necessarily mean you can be a remotely competent attorney.   It also doesn't help that it would be close to impossible to get hired or to get non-family clients without a law degree.
suits,342v80,psuedopseudo,5,Mon Apr 27 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"Probably similar to why you can't practice medicine without going to medical school. Your client (patient) is not going to have the expertise to know whether you can do your job - that is why they need to hire a professional. So maybe you can cram for the bar and pass it, but then you miss some important point on a case because you never actually learned the basics of law, and now your client ends up in prison or loses their business.  Yes you learn a lot on the job and going to law school doesn't make you error-proof, but if you just needed to pass a single exam, you could practice while being severely under-qualified."

suits,33t0qj,SMc-Twelve,7,Sun Apr 26 01:06:00 2015 UTC,"Ideally, they'd make partner. There's no pay scale for partners - it depends on the firm's profitability. Average profits per partner for major law firms were just under $1.5 million last year.  But that's the average - what each partner gets would depend on his or her contribution. The bigger your book of business, the bigger your cut of the profits.  If you don't make partner? Generally you leave the firm. You could work with a recruiter and try to get hired as lateral partner at another (often smaller) firm. Or you might go in-house, and work for a company directly. Or go into public service, or even become a solo practitioner.  Pay obviously varies, depending on your choice.  In house counsel typically earn less than biglaw associates, but there's no universal scale. But even in-house, you could (theoretically) eventually make General Counsel or something. GC's can make millions. And even if you don't, work/life balance tends to be better in-house, without the pressure to hit billable hour targets and prospect for new business."

For example, in the legal profession, where this system is most commonly found, all law school graduates hired by a law firm who graduated in the same year receive the same base pay, regardless of the background, experience, or ability of each. These associates will also receive automatic annual pay raises, bonuses, and promotions. Alternatively, some law firms implement a lockstep compensation system starting with partners or partner-track associates.

Chandler was always lending Joey money and was employed for most of the series until towards the latter half, by which his wife was already a popular chef.  Ross always had a job, when Rachel didnt, she basically roomed with someone who could help her out, and Phoebe barely counts. So youre argument is WAY invalid.

suits,33l9ht,tylerdurden2000,8,Thu Apr 23 19:13:55 2015 UTC,Speak for yourself.  I would consider it compelling TV if Mike was answering discovery requests with a deadline quickly approaching and the other side won't grant them an extension.  Could cut that tension with a knife.
suits,33l9ht,AKindChap,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:03:39 2015 UTC,That's not the law though. That's just a drama show about law.

suits,33l9ht,borntoperform,30,Fri Apr 24 05:43:47 2015 UTC,"This sounds so boring.   I think the problem with Suits is that it's focusing on the wrong relationship. The romantic pairings (Mike/Rachel, Harvey/Donna, Harvey/whoever, Jessica/whoever) don't matter. Harvey and Mike have the central relationship to the show. Whether it's soap opera drama or legal drama, as long as it's focusing on the two of them (being friends or not, as opposing counsel trying to outwit each other, or mentor/mentee), the show is much better."

suits,33l9ht,ddrmagic,7,Thu Apr 23 14:31:10 2015 UTC,or it could make Donna shed her feelings for Harvey and she may hook up with someone else.   That would be fucked up. And too repetitive.
suits,33l9ht,ed2rummy,4,Thu Apr 23 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"In my opinion suits is heading the wrong way. They should focus on the law, big lawsuits, complicated situations, and how to solve mike's fraud. They should do cases for harvard where they can access files and be in that moral grey area of planting more fake evidence of him going there or SOMETHING. Perhaps negotiate with harvard due to client attourney privledge or something.  just something. Focus on the law, dabble in the soap opera drama. Focus on the fucking law."
suits,33l9ht,enterthecircus,7,Fri Apr 24 06:43:11 2015 UTC,There is no upward trajectory for the as it always ends up with Mike almost being found out. There is only a downward trend but the writers are unwillling to break apart the law firm and boot Harvey out the firm.  The show is getting redundant and soapy.

I don't see why it is so shocking to see that someone else would use someone else like the character of Harvey as a role model. I've actually found it fairly common to see a lot of law students recently citing Harvey as their reason for going into law(or at least, Suits being a show that got them thinking about studying law), although I feel they may be in for a bit of a sudden awakening, when they realize how different the current law market is."
suits,30zqqn,Scire_facias,3,Wed Apr 1 01:56:18 2015 UTC,because Suits isnt how law works. Its not real and sometimes it seems like alot of people in this subreddit believe it is. Its a glamorized TV show. Its one thing to watch it and enjoy it for what it is but for that to be the inspiration you get into Law...well thats  a bit alarming.   its like saying House of Lies is actually how life as a management consultant really is.

Really depend what you're looking for."

suits,3010xf,nsew,11,Mon Mar 23 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"LOVE Better Call Saul. To me it's a much higher caliber show. Exellent writing, better acting, and I feel like the plot line is actually going somewhere. I know they're different types of shows, but I find BCS a lot deeper and more involved.   Don't get me wrong, I like Suits. And we're watching the 4th season right now.   But Vince Gilligan can do no wrong. I just love BCS."
suits,3010xf,lin_ny,2,Mon Mar 23 17:04:53 2015 UTC,"I love the actor who plays Saul, and I loved him in the few clips he had here and there in BB, so when I heard they making a spin-off specifically about him, I was ecstatic. While the show started off slow, I've really come to appreciate the artistic nature of BCS. The acting is at the same level of BB (and therefore well above Suits), and there is so much potential story-wise. Suits, on the other hand, continues to repeat the same plot over and over again. I actually stopped watching Suits after season 2 and just decided to speed my way through Season 3 and part of season 4, and the overall mood is still the same. I'm surprised it's getting a season 5, it should be the series finale."

It doesn't grab you in like BrBa or Suits did.   With Suits you were forced into Mike and Harvey's life from episode one, you saw that Harvey saw Mike like a little Harvey and that Mike was gonna see Harvey as a role model. I don't get that feeling from BCS. That connection to the characters.   With BrBa you were shoved head first into Walters life. BCS just seems like that quirky cousin you enjoy seeing at the family reunion but really don't care to talk to the rest of the year.   BCS already seems like is crested and is on its last leg to me. It is more of a time waster I use after I On Demand The Walking Dead."
suits,3010xf,z9nine,2,Mon Mar 23 17:36:16 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, at this same point in Breaking Bad, I was not even remotely drawn into it. Breaking Bad was entirely about character development and attachment to the characters. Better Call Saul as far as I can tell so far is exactly the same; give it another 3-4 episodes and I reckon it will start receiving the same praises as Breaking Bad."
suits,3010xf,ScreamingEnglishman,0,Mon Mar 23 20:43:17 2015 UTC,"I started BrBa once the first season maybe the second was on Netflix, so maybe I didn't have to go through the growing pains of it. I'm not writing BCS off but I also am not clamoring to watch it every week either I'm content to catch up a few episodes at a time when I get the chance.   Suits, I would either watch as it aired or the day after On Demand for the first season. Due to moving and basically forgetting the show came back for a second season and subsequent I ended up binging the whole thing on Prime right before the current season started. The most recent season I went back to watching the next day or the same day I would watch all my shows. I rarely missed a week.   When I heard they were doing a BCS show, I was expecting it to take place at the same time as BrBa. So, when I finally watched it I was and still am confused as fuck about the current timeline. I never really paid attention to the back story of Saul on BrBa since I always saw him as comedic relief. I'll probably wait till this season is over or goes to break and binge the entire season with some episode guides handy. Then give a final decision on how I like it."
suits,3010xf,z9nine,-5,Mon Mar 23 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"Better Call Saul is super boring.  The prestige of BB is the only reason it's popular.  It has just enough in it for me not to have quit already on it, but I keep waiting for a spark.  It seems like it will take SEASONS to get anywhere like BB on this show.  We need some Gus.  Suits is way better than BCS so far, even though it's like a soap opera and there is some cheesy writing."

Kind of like Harvey, but better because she doesn't let personal stuff get in the way...sigh or at least she didn't used to.  Why do you think she's ""a bitch""?"
suits,3005db,Slumpt,0,Tue Mar 24 01:02:36 2015 UTC,"Possibly because she can't decide whether to scheme behind people's backs, or resorting to bullying in the open in order to strongarm others into obeying her? She's incredibly twofaced, and a bitch either way."
suits,3005db,GenericName3,3,Fri Mar 27 07:53:47 2015 UTC,"You realize that approaching every problem in the same way could be pretty ineffective leadership right? Do you honestly think she could use the same tactics on Harvey as she would on Louis? And two-faced I don't think that terms means what you think it means.   Jessica has no reason and never has disguised her intentions. She's Managing Partner she doesn't need to scheme to have her employees do her bidding she only has to voice her request. She's very upfront that the firm will always come first so if Harvey or Louis decide to go soft on a case over sentimental reason, if Jessica gets wind of it she'll always make the decision that benefits the firm the most. That isn't two-faced that's a person with a very singular agenda.  When she had the opportunity to just throw senior partnership to gain Louis' vote against Hardman she didn't do because it would not have been geninue. When Harvey tried to usurp her position using Darby Jessica was pissed but she moved on and never held it against him."

Rachel fucked up once by kissing Logan and admitting that to Mike especially with all the hostility brewing could have irrevocably ruined their relationship.

Yeah I've watched it more then once and ultimately using the ""downhire"" strategy to avoid committing a crime makes more sense then him hiring Mike as an associate.  So based on your aggressive stance you assume Jessica would rather let a brilliant worker walk away rather then hire him? That's idiotic.  I'm an associate director at an investment bank, we regularly encounter people who do not meet our hiring guide lines (M7 hires), so we downhire and train up.  Nothing stops me from getting an analyst to do associate work, we just leave their name off the docket and this builds a strong talent pool.  Hiring Mike as a paralegal could have let them hire him legally, then Harvey could train him in the same capacity as desired (with or without Jessica's permission).  At the end of the day I acknowledge he could never work their as an associate unless he went to Harvard (which he cannot attend), however if he is as stellar as we are made to believe maybe a Columbia educated hire would work (which he could get into as he wanted to go legit).

The reason why the ""downhire"" strategy as you presented it isn't applicable in Mike's situation is mainly for the following reason:  Harvey likes this. As depicted many times throughout the series.  He was tasked by Jessica to hire his personal associate when he made senior partner but didn't want to, saying he works better alone anyway although he came around eventually.   When Mike and Harvey first met (the interview, not the time when Mike was still a bike messenger) Harvey, although impressed by Mike's legal knowledge and his ability to quote some random page from the legal handbook, was about to throw Mike out when he looked at the other seemingly boring applicants, imagining how annoying it would be to have to work with any one of them and decided to give Mike a shot.  Sure, right in this moment he maybe should have thought about this whole downhire thing but who's to say he didn't? Maybe he imagined telling Jessica how all applicants were boring as fuck but hey, he found this brilliant college dropout that could start as a paralegal at the firm going to community college at night. Maybe he knew how hard it would be to convince Jessica that this isn't just a way to get out of this associate thing and believe me Jessica would have suspected just that. Furthermore, this situation puts him in control, which he enjoys so much. Out of a pesky task he get's a brilliant associate. He is the one calling the shots, not Jessica. He wins, again.   But he should have thought about the consequences!  What consequences? He is Harvey fucking Specter."

Harvey always has 'bigger fish to fry' and his focus has always been on his career (which he used to buffer the loss of his dad). In the instances when he does find romantic love, his ego (developed from being a winner in his career) blinds him from what really matters (a romantic life partner). Needless to say, without Harvey's career, he has nothing. To complete his character development he would have both (I'm guessing, i'm not a writer for the show). But perhaps the premise of the show is that people can change, Mike did with his former life and perhaps Harvey in terms of love. Or the show may be illustrating that work isn't everything and they are using Mike (Successful career and marriage) and Harvey (Successful career, no marriage) to illustrate the point.  To quote the second season when Mike breaks things off with Rachel (because Harvey told him to) after they went on a first date: Harvey ""You have plenty of time to find the right girl Mike."" Mike ""I'm sure you told yourself that at 25 and 30 and 35 and I'm sure you'll tell yourself that when your 50."""

Some of the best endings involve a tragic or a sad ending for the hero or the protagonist/main character, and I can see the writers taking a more artistic route.

suits,2zagt7,cescalina,3,Mon Mar 16 23:28:05 2015 UTC,So you are jealous of Mike because you aren't super successful at your job?  Lots of anger in that post.
suits,2zagt7,tylerdurden2000,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"No, I'm angry at Mike because I love the show and dislike him and he takes up a lot of the time of the show. I think I just phrased that part weirdly. I am good at my job, but it is nothing even vaguely similar to being a lawyer so wouldnt make a difference to me either way, what I meant by that was that he is only good at his job because people pop up and give him ""ideas"". This happens in a lot of tv shows, I know that, but it annoys me in this because he is supposed to be some wonder child"
suits,2zagt7,_Fire_and_Ice_,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:32:54 2015 UTC,"While I agree that sometimes Mike can frustrate me, I think you need to view the characters in the context of the whole show. If character acted exactly how you wanted them too at all times there would be no drama or interesting character developments. Furthermore while on a scene by scene basis character flaws (as you the ones you described Mike as having) can seem slightly frustrating, you want and you need these for a good show. It's what makes the characters human, allows the viewer to see themselves in shoes of the characters. And I do not think mike has more unreasonable character flaws than the other characters.   Going more specifically into your complaints:  I don't think because Mike has a strong sense of morality with regards to defending guilty people compared to other lawyers that makes him unrealistic of annoying. You claim that if all lawyers paraded around like that there would be no criminal justice system. But Mike is not saying no one should defend the person, only that he doesn't want to. There is a big difference between saying that you will not lower you moral standards to do what you feel is wrong and saying no one can. Also this changes to a degree as the show progresses, his strong sense of morals and wanting to do what is right is key dynamic in the Harvey/Mike relationship. And as we see during Ava's murder trial for large part of the trial Mike thought she was guilty of murder, yet he is still defending her. He says "" I know what you think, and I think it too"" to Harvey and then something that they admitted to each other they are defending a guilty person.   I agree that his handling of the lawyer involved in his parents case wasn't the best maybe. But you can't expect someone to act rationally when dealing with something as emotional as his parents death. That's part of the character, Mike has emotions.   With regards to your critique of Rachel, I also feel that she could have been madder at Mike longer following his reveal. Or at least they could have shown it more. However I do not believe that has should have anything to do with him ""getting paid much more than she is, for doing essentially the same job, because he lied about his degree"". We see again and again that Rachel does not care too much about money, her parents are very wealthy yet she is trying to make it on her own (also paralegal work and mike's associate work is not the same).  She wasn't more upset at Mike because his reveal was also a massive showing of trust. In the context of their romantic relationship it was obviously a huge; while she may be mad at him for deceiving her for a bit, he didn't actually do anything to her, his secret doesn't hurt her, hence she doesn't really have too much to be mad about.   As as side note, if these character flaws annoy you so much I don't quite understand why you call for more Louis. Don't get me wrong, I really like Louis. But these emotional character flaws of Mike you hate, Louis epitomizes them at times."

suits,2yrm20,J50GT,3,Thu Mar 12 13:00:02 2015 UTC,"Windsor ""Win"" Horne Lockwood, III:       Windsor ""Win"" Horne Lockwood, III is a fictional character created by Harlan Coben. He is the secondary character in the Myron Bolitar series. While the best friend of hero Bolitar, Win would best be described as an anti-hero, being very psychopathic in nature. In many of the books, Myron and Win debate the ethical nature of various actions, often Win's.  Introduce in the first book of the series, Deal Breaker, Win is a 31 year-old bachelor working closely with Myron Bolitar, his best friend since college. Win is also very close to Esperanza Diaz, Myron's assistant (and later business partner) whom he meets through Myron.  Win's hair is described as blond, perfect length, parted on the left side. His features are classical patrician, almost too handsome, like something crafted in porcelain. His attire is always thoroughbred prep - pink shirts, polo shirts, monogrammed shirts, khaki pants, golf pants, white bucks (Memorial Day to Labor Day) or wing tips (Labor Day to Memorial Day) on his feet. He is even said to have a strange accent, one that did not originate from any particular geographical location as much as from his prep school, Exeter. He is an excellent golfer, with a three handicap; he is a fifth-generation member of Merion Golf Club in Philadelphia, and third-generation member at Pine Valley in southern New Jersey. He has a perennial ""golf tan"", one of those where the color could be found only in the arms (short-sleeve shirts) and a V-shape in the neck (open alligator shirt). It is also said that Win’s skin never gets tanned, instead his skin burns. People are said to hate him on sight for his looks and money.  Win is a sixth-degree black belt holder in Tae Kwon Do, which is the highest ranking in the United States. He has been studying Tae Kwon Do since the age of seven, and introduced Myron to Tae Kwon Do in college. Win brought a Master Kwan from Korea fourteen years prior to the first novel to teach him Tae Kwon Do. Win loves to meditate, and does so at least an hour each day. Throughout the books it is made clear that along with being one of the world's best hand to hand fighters Win is also proficient with a wide variety of weapons, at following people unseen, breaking and entering, interrogation and intimidation, marksmanship and well connected with intelligence agencies. Win and Myron worked for the FBI in an undisclosed manner prior to the start of the series. Win has continued to be a vigilante in various capacities throughout the series, often unbeknownst to Myron. In one of the more recent books it is shown that Win has been helping not only law enforcement in the USA but internationally, and that he may well be doing more vigilantism that ever. In the most recent books Win is now in his mid to late 40s and so it may be the case that he is trying to get as much done as possible before age forces him to retire, but this is speculation.  Win exhibits many traits that would class him as a high functioning psychopath. He shows no aversion to violence and seems to enjoy inflicting pain and killing those he believes deserve it. He has a very high sex drive and almost no emotional attachments to other humans, Myron makes up one of only a handful of people Win seems to have any care in the world for. It is frequently observed his relationships with women tend to last a night at most. He displays a high level of narcissism and can overreact to slights or threats.  Win does appear to have a moral code though it is not clear how strictly he follows it or what exactly it is. Win does not hurt innocents and indeed often sticks up for them, fighting for victims of abuse and persecution.  The origin of Win's maniacal drive to be a killing machine is partly revealed in 'Promise Me' when Win recalls taking a horrible beating as a young child from children his own age. He was terrified at the time and never again wanted to feel scared. This was his motivation to become a formidable fighter. It was noted in Back Spin though that Win was always cold even as a child and that he walked in on his mother cheating on his father at a young age, damaging that relationship irrevocably.  Win owns the well-established Lock-Horne Investments & Securities, and he also owns his office building. Lock-Horne Investments & Securities covers 6 floors. Win has a corner office with a view of both Forty-Seventh Street and Park Avenue.  Win and Myron are both fans of Batman, often referring to their transport as the ""Batmobile"".

suits,2yrm20,dking168,0,Fri Mar 13 01:00:13 2015 UTC,"It's the exact same concept except it's art forgery instead.   In need of an associate, big-time Manhattan art forger Peter Burke hires the only guy who impresses him -- college dropout Neil Caffery. The fact that Caffery isn't actually a forger isn't lost on Specter, who believes his new right-hand man is an art prodigy with the book smarts of a Art Institute of Chicago grad and the street smarts of a hustler. However, in order to keep their jobs, the charade must remain strictly between these two unconventional thieves.  Yeah, maybe not.

I just started watching the series for the first time not long ago, and am almost caught up (yuck, this is why I don't get started on new shows very often).  The tone change from season 1 to season 2 was pretty big, and aside from a few moments here and there, I haven't enjoyed any of the seasons nearly as much as the first. The first was fun; the second and after got overwrought and sometimes mean and often frustrating.  It kind of reminds me of the later seasons of Burn Notice, honestly, which weren't that great."

suits,2ykn9c,Citygrl29,28,Tue Mar 10 16:39:51 2015 UTC,There is 0% chance mike will get his name on the door. He is just an associate and rachel hasn't even finished law school. Why would you ever think he'd get named partner? He probably gets exposed to the public before he has the chance to make junior partner.  And Harvey will never leave and go anywhere else especially not the DAs office. Why would he leave corporate law when he has made it to the very top and earning tens of millions?
suits,2ykn9c,YellowBaboon,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:53:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about named partner at Pearson Specter. I'm talking about he and whoever else starting their own firm.

suits,2ykn9c,MrLeBAMF,6,Tue Mar 10 16:58:43 2015 UTC,"The fact still stands: too many people know about Mike's secret for him to become a partner, let alone a name/founding partner at ANY firm.

suits,2yj5nl,azilla14,7,Tue Mar 10 06:05:03 2015 UTC,"I think around 3 years. Each season being around 3/4 of a year. We don't get many clues as to the passage of time but the few clues we do get suggest this. My estimates are:  Season 4: 4.5months  The latest episode when Harvey is talking with Cahill he says ""What the hell have you been doing for the last 3 months"". Meaning 3 months have passed between the midseason finale and now.   I think the first half of season 4 was over a shorter timeline as it was mostly during the takeover battle. Which generally happen pretty fast. If I recall correctly there is a 10 day moratorium preventing Logan from purchasing stocks that spans a couple episodes. And also there is time when Sidwell gives Mike a week to deleverage his position. These suggest that the takeover battle all happened fairly quickly. Maybe a month total.   Between Season 3 & 4: 3 Months  In the 1st episode of the season when Sidwell is scolding Mike for only doing small deals he says Mike has been there 3 months.  Season 3: 1 year  Midseason we find out Rachel gets accepted to Stanford and Colombia. Since I think Law school applications are only annual? This would imply that a year has passed since she got rejected from harvard at the end of season 2. This does makes some sense as major cases like the bribery charge and then murder charge take quite a while. And the merger would also have taken some time.   The second half of the season gives no clues as to timeline. However it seems to happen fairly fast, maybe 2 months.   Season 2: 5 Months  The main clues we get from this season are through Rachel's law school application. She takes the LSAT in episode 3 and get her score in episode 9. Typically LSAT scores take around 1 month.  She the applies to Harvard in episode 14 and finds out she didn't get in episode 15. Minimum then 2 months should have occured between these epsiodes between the application deadline and when you find out mid spring, but presumably more since Rachel would not have applied at the last minute. However I feel like the writers didn't care too much about matching the timeline of the show and cases to the harvard application timeline so using this as a guideline is questionable.   Season 1: 7 months Very few indicators are given as far as I remember as too the length of the season. However at the start of season 2 when Jessica takes Mike to dinner, Harvey makes a comment about past First years taken to lunch by Jessica. Implying that it is still Mikes 1st year at that point."

His relationship ship with Jessica was part of it, even though she wanted to keep it professional originally if he came to work for the firm. The other part is that he was with the SEC, and was brought on board to help fight them when it was discovered that they were coming after the firm and their clients after the allegations of collusion between Mike and Harvey over Gillis Industries."

suits,2y6fnn,ems187,37,Sat Mar 7 14:25:00 2015 UTC,"Because at this point it's pretty much a soap opera. I like Suits, but no way it's one of the best (in any context). Season 1 and 2 were great, I thought season 4 has been absolute shambles. The writers are constantly having people fight over the smallest of things, just to create a little bit of drama. Like why the hell does every interaction between two people end with one person saying something dramatic, and then walking away, with some dramatic music.  Everyone is constantly changing their stance on everything, ie. Mike believing his client and then not believing him, and once again believing  him again.  And then Louis hating Mike, and being a total dick to everyone, only to change his mind after about 3 episodes. There's so much drama, and not the kind of legal drama that made it such a good show, but just emotional crap (not that emotion in a TV series can't be a good thing).  Another thing: the dialogue. I like metaphors as much as the next person, but at this point it's just too much. Every other sentence has some completely unnecessary metaphor. Too much use of words like goddamn and bullshit. I realize they can't/won't use words like fuck or shit, but less is more in this case.  spoiler  One last thing: I don't think the old Harvey and Mike are really back. In S1 and S2 there was always some sort of friendly banter between them, while working a case. Now they just constantly argue about everything, always disagreeing and getting angry at each other.  Sorry for the rant."
suits,2y6fnn,friendofJohnnyQQ,4,Fri Mar 6 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's just a soap opera now that sticks the story in a loop. Nothing has really progressed... I thought we were going somewhere with Mike not being a lawyer but that was over real quick."

You can be a hotshot lawyer without constant references to Michael Jordan or Muhammad Ali. It sounds really, really lazy and sometimes ridiculous.  They have such a good concept here but they've executed it pretty poorly. I see people around here and other USA network show subs asking why some people haven't been nominated for Emmy's. Seriously?

Next, Mike screws up, Harvey's mad, Donna talks to him, Harvey reconsiders. Harvey covers up for Mike. Louise is mad over something petty, Mike/Harvey/Donna/Rachel make him reconsider.  Also, every now and then, Harvey doesn't care about me! - Mike/Louise/Rachel. Donna talks to Harvey, Harvey opens up.   Rinse, repeat.

This is fine, but I think when a person is also consuming truly excellent shows, it makes the short comings of the USA formula seem all the more egregious. The thing about Suits is on the surface it presents itself as one of those shows. It has really good actors, is shot well, is super slick, and can seem complex at times. But when you peel the layers back, you see that all the characters are pretty thin. They're fun to follow, but you aren't really getting complexity from Suits that you might find in the other great shows people talk about all the time."

suits,2y6fnn,PeteMullersKeyboard,2,Sun Mar 8 21:29:43 2015 UTC,"This will sound weird, but if Suits were on HBO and ran different...it wouldn't be Suits. I enjoy Suits because it's pretty popcorn, and doesn't demand much from the viewer. Even though I subscribe to this subreddit, I don't feel the need to go online to discuss the latest episode as soon as it goes off the air like I do for some shows, because Suits just isn't that deep...and I kinda like it that way.   That said, I do wish they would stretch themselves just a bit. As you mentioned, a few minor characters would be nice. Especially minor characters that stand on their own, and don't exist to serve Harvey and Mike's story. That's why I liked Katrina so much. She existed, granted for Louis, but she wasn't beholden to Mike, Harvey, or Donna y'know? She was close to being her own character."

The show would have been better off letting him stay as an investment banker ( that story line was random as hell and almost a joke for how long it even lasted), but we want the Harvey/Mike dynamic so of course he went back to Pearson Spector ( Litt).

suits,2y6fnn,PeteMullersKeyboard,0,Sun Mar 8 21:19:11 2015 UTC,Hmmm. I disagree. If you want courtroom drama then watch Law&Order. They may not attend court every episode but that doesn't mean they aren't being lawyers. And I find that the relationship drama takes a back seat to the actual cases they work. I'm not saying the show is perfect. I just don't agree that there isn't enough lawyering ;)
suits,2y6fnn,Citygrl29,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:29:20 2015 UTC,"I think Suits has a case of writers trying their hand at material that just isn't their expertise. Some shows especially ones that start off successful the writers have it in their mind's that they should kick it up a notch in order to keep it fresh. Not realizing that even that's a noble endeavor they just don't have the writing chops to pull of certain storylines.  For example Mike/Rachel's relationship. Everyone dug it when it was a flirtation and when Rachel was this independent/sassy paralegal that wasn't afraid to call Mike on his shit.  The writers put them in a relationship and they end up ruining the Rachel character. And create storylines that many fans hate (Rachel being needy), (Logan, Mike, and Rachel triangle).   Then they started down this betrayal, loyalty, themes season 3. Their own character they built they have him do something that was completely out of character. Throw out decades of trust, loyalty, with Harvey Jessica relationship. And they have in the same token trust/align with both Darby and Steven.   The last character Donna she was great at one liners, being Harvey' sounding board, and just a friend to him. The past two seasons she's evolved to this needy, Harvey-centric, secretary that is always over-stepping her boundaries.  The bromance the entire show was built on has all but disappeared. Now it's just a show of couples or potential couples."

There are very few subs around about shows that aren't full of nothing but complaints about how people think it should be better or that it's gotten worse for x, y, and z reasons. The only sub I can think of that didn't suffer from it was Breaking Bad, but that's because it was one of the greatest shows put on television.   The Burn Notice sub blasted all over it during the later seasons, despite the final one being one of the highest rated of the entire season.  This last season of Suits was the best in terms of IMDB ratings. So there are obviously a lot of people, like myself, that still love the show and don't think it's a steaming pile of dogshit  like a lot of people around here make it out to be.   I just did a rewatch prior to the last half of Season 4 with my fiancée, who hadn't seen the show before. Watching it all together made me like a lot of the stuff with Mike and Rachel more than I did when it originally aired.

suits,2y2tyj,StubbornAssassin,8,Fri Mar 6 01:08:30 2015 UTC,"Season 1 was definitely the least serious of them all and they had the most fun with it. The plot was usually self-contained within the episode which gave them the freedom to play with the characters a bit.  But honestly, the show had to evolve into something worth watching beyond lawyers getting high and making movie references.  The last few episodes actually did a good job nodding to its past while moving the wider reaching plot forward. When the show gets into grooves like this, I really feel like the show has been matured and sculpted into a great series.  However, the first half of season 3 and 4 have been dumb, dull and not worth watching. The entire time Mike left Pearson Specter I felt the show was a mess. It had no idea what to do with the characters except make them fight each other. The whole Rachel cheating subplot was so dumb and forced, it solidified my dislike of her dynamic in the show. If you watched the this season's finale then you'll know she's not going anywhere soon either.  So basically, the show's hit or miss and there really hasn't been a consistent, entertaining season since 2 and while the past few episodes did fairly well in redeeming itself, I feel like the first half the next season is going to be a mess just like the past two before it."

suits,2y17r9,ReflexMan,13,Thu Mar 5 21:59:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, I felt like this episode was extremely subpar. I'll break it down. Spoilers ahead.  The Main Plot  This was very dissatisfying. Having Harvey win by wearing a wire was extremely anticlimactic. Instead of beating the guy with the law or something very Harvey-like, he just wore a wire. And it was also bad that this guy, who is evidently very smart and has been dominating people for over 10 years without ever getting his comeuppance...and he gets it by incriminating himself on a wire? Come on...  Mike and Rachel  Maybe I am just a cynic, but I don't get why people always feel so much emotion when moments like this happen. They almost never feel earned or real. If the writers do their job well, this kind of moment can feel very real and sincere, and it can feel earned. But most of the time, when I sense a proposal coming, it's just like, ""Oh, yeah, I guess it's about that time, huh."" There's almost always a romantic plot in any given show, and they always seem to follow the exact same pattern. I get that tropes are a thing, but when the relationship in your show just feels like it is on rails, doing the same old thing, it feels cheap. First, they meet and will-they-won't-they. After about a season, they get together. After about a season, they get engaged. After about a season, they get pregnant. After a season, they have the baby. It's always the same. The time might change a bit between any two steps, but it's always roughly the same, and it never feels like anything to me. It's that ""that point in the show when the characters have to get engaged.""  Louis and Norma  This one seriously baffles me. Sure, they got to showcase Rick Hoffman's acting, but my god, why dedicate an entire episode to the death of a joke-character. Norma is The Ghost, a commonly used in-joke, where a character is referred to often, but never shown. In some shows, this character can actually be important to the plot at some point, like Maris on Frasier. Other times, this character is purely for joke value, such as Norma in this case. Norma has had absolutely no impact on the show other than being a running gag. Having an entire episode dedicated to her death felt so awkward. Trying to get emotions out of the audience on the basis of a non-existent character is trying too hard, in my opinion.  Donna and Harvey  This plot would have been fine. In most regards, I consider the bombshell of Donna leaving Harvey for Louis to be a good plot point and a decent cliffhanger. The one thing that sours it for me is the previous point. There was obviously Donna and Harvey stuff going on already, but I feel like a large part of the reason Donna is leaving for Louis is because of the time she spent with him about Norma. So the foundation of this major plot point is built on top of what I consider to be a ridiculous plot line. Like I said, this one is not nearly as bad as the others, it was just soured a little bit.  TL;DR:  All in all, I felt like this episode had almost nothing to offer. The main plot was a cheap victory, the romantic plot is just chugging along, riding the rails that every show ever rides. The side plot was trying way too hard to evoke emotions about a non-character. The only thing that worked well at all was the reveal at the end with Donna and Harvey."
suits,2y17r9,Ilyak1986,6,Thu Mar 5 16:49:29 2015 UTC,"I think the Louis/Norma thing was supposed to be more comedic than anything considering how much Rick Hoffman was just chewing the scenery over a gag character. I was laughing at that the whole time. The stupid part was that the C plot had relevance on the A plot.  As for the Donna/Harvey thing, it's just obnoxious, because we all know that in 2-3 episodes, it's going to go back to Donna with Harvey, with added romantic displays of affection. I mean every time Aaron Korsh has said ""we don't want to just put the situation back immediately"", it's resolved in 2-3 episodes. EG Mike/Harvey at the beginning of season 3? Louis finding out Mike's secret in 4B?   I mean the Donna/Harvey resolution is dirt simple: Rachel goes to deliver something to Harvey, goes ""hey, where's Donna"", finds her working for Louis, wonders what's up, while Donna spots the ring, girl talk scene breaking the Bechdel test about love/marriage/blah blah, and Rachel plays matchmaker in some fashion or another, if not bringing Mike into it.  And the Forstman conclusion? Ugh, ugh, UGH. Considering how much Daniel Hardman was a pain in the ass, I'm hoping Forstman can be an the final boss villain in this show. Korsh better not permanently put him away before then."
suits,2y17r9,harumscarum1991,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:59:37 2015 UTC,"I agree on the first two points but I don 't think they had the Louis/Norma storyline to try and get the audience sad about Norma. They're aware that we don't really care about her beyond being the occasional butt of a joke. But they probably decided first that they want Donna to leave Harvey, but still be in the firm and also that having her work for Louis would be a huge WTF moment on the show. Then they just had to figure out how to make it possible for Donna to work for Louis = kill off Norma.   Her death was not meant to be important in itself, but just an opening for the Donna/Louis thing to happen."
suits,2y17r9,ReflexMan,1 point,Fri Mar 6 09:01:25 2015 UTC,"I guess it makes sense if you think of it not like, ""dumb thing happens, dumb thing ends up being the justification for major thing,"" but instead like, ""seemingly dumb thing happens, major thing happens, revealing some important behind seemingly dumb thing.""  But even so, because of the way it was presented in order to us, by the time the Norma plot line had ended, my eyes had rolled so hard that when the Donna/Harvey thing happened, it soured it a bit.  So I guess there is a bit to it, like you said. It just reminded me of Scrubs, when there was an entire episode devoted to the death of an extremely minor character. In that case, it was pretty obviously meant to be a character showcase for one of the main characters (Carla), but all I could think then, too, was, ""Why do I care about this character dying?""  Anyway, Suits is still awesome, and I really enjoy it, but when the final episode of a season comes along, and it seems to be the perfect storm of bad/cliche plot lines, it makes me sad."

Instead of beating the guy with the law or something very Harvey-like, he just wore a wire. And it was also bad that this guy, who is evidently very smart and has been dominating people for over 10 years without ever getting his comeuppance...and he gets it by incriminating himself on a wire? Come on...   its showing that the simple route can sometimes be the least expecting and most effective. Forceman had leverage against them on everything, I personally loved it"

I hear you, with this being the final moment of the season finale, BUT considering that for as long as he'd been working, Donna had been his secretary (and more), her leaving him voluntarily to Louis of all people, (someone who, despite many attempts on Louis' part, he never really ""lost"" to) it is a pretty big blow.

Harvey gets a mini-Donna secretary, Donna and Harvey will reconcile and finally get together, Mike gets married and everything is flowers and rainbows until someone comes saying they know Mikes secret."

suits,2xyr2p,RichWPX,4,Thu Mar 5 07:58:52 2015 UTC,"I think he is used to always winning and getting his way. He knows that he always finds a way to beat the other person, and he never really considers losing a real possibility. I doubt Harvey started off arrogant either, but after winning so much you start to think you're untouchable. When everything always seems to work out for you, you don't really consider the consequences of your actions anymore, if you want to bribe an SEC agent or blackmail someone then go for it, if you want to gloat about your victory to someone that hates you what are they going to do about it? Also this is just a TV show, but realistically I think the statue of limitations might have run out on that after 12 years, so he might be able to brag freely without caring who hears. When you've been in the game as long as Forstman, and have pretty much been able to do whatever you want just because of your wealth and power, you don't really consider something as trivial as a wire anymore, especially when you are likely having closed door meeting that discuss illegal activity/trading as often as Forstman does."

Doing actual lawyer work, skipping class to work and this episode she kept her clothes on...  - Jeff Malone is gone and really not missed in this episode...maybe we're done with him?   Yeah, probably not...he did seem too sensitive to be a corporate lawyer...he's no Travis Tanner...  - Norma turns out to be the person who's leaving the firm...sacrifice of the unseen...the only screen time she got was in her urn...  - Donna seemed very ""un-Donna"" and sort of off her pins with the whole ""I love you Donna"" scene going largely undiscussed between she and Harvey.  She was good with Louis and that bond was nice to see.  Perhaps they're shuffling the desks so that she and Louis can have a professional relationship and she and Harvey can give one another longing looks for most of season 5."

They had bad ratings, at least at the beginning of the season, and this is a contributing factor. ""Coming this summer"" causes people to lose interest and not even know when to start looking for the show to start back again. That could be any time in a span of about three months. The casual viewers are going to drop out and it causes USA to have to spend a lot of money marketing to get them back in.   I know a lot of shows use this model but to me it just seems the past couple of seasons have been way too fragmented for my taste."

suits,2xyr2p,Okieant33,31,Thu Mar 5 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"That Forstman conclusion was ridiculous, completely goes against what we have been told to expect from him. Yes, maybe Forstman was arrogant, but surely he is not stupid enough to talk about that kind of stuff with a person who has a personal vendetta against him. The second he started talking I was wondering why he would be so stupid to say that, it serves no purpose, he already won. Harvey is beneath him in his mind, and Forstman shouldn't give him the time of day he should ignore him.  Also it didn't seem like a very strong confession. ""That may or may not be the truth, but that is not what people will hear"" (or something along those lines) is not really a confession. It may as well be taken as telling Harvey that it doesn't matter what the truth is, the only thing that matters is how things look. It is not a statement made to confirm or deny Harvey's accusations, just to tell Harvey that it would be irrational to pursue this strategy. I'm sure it could be useful as circumstantial evidence, but you cannot rest an entire case upon such a vague comment.  Also whether or not Forstman was guilty, Harvey kept the money because he was too afraid to tell his brother. I don't see how Harvey is let off the hook given that he knew Forstman traded on insider information provided by him, yet he let his brother keep the bonus and never reported the illegal insider trading to the SEC. He may not have knowingly traded insider information in a quid pro quo situation, but that does not mean he is innocent.  I understand they have to take liberties given it is a TV series, but there are limits. If complicated situations are always solved by suddenly coming up with a simple trick that just works, then the situations are no longer interesting. They build up Forstman as a formidable enemy, and then bring him down in a 3 minute scene that could have been thought up by a 13 year old and which reduced Forstman to an idiot. He may have been unscrupulous and that may have made him a bit more rich and powerful than he would have otherwise, but you don't get that rich and powerful without at least a little intellect in that world. Plenty of people are unscrupulous and greedy, few have the potential to become billionaires and if they try they get caught long before."
suits,2xyr2p,thrillated,25,Thu Mar 5 13:04:35 2015 UTC,"This post really exemplifies just how ridiculous the solutions to storylines in Suits can be sometimes. There is always a loophole they find last minute. It is frustrating because the show in the first season was really solid writing. Yes, it was full of drama much like it is now amongst the characters, but the cases each week were at least viable for the most part. Even when it was finding its legs, the fact that Mike was able to analyze situations quickly and efficiently was a force to be reckoned with. Has he lost some of that skill in the last few years?   Also, I totally agree that Forstman (sp?) would likely not waltz into Harvey's office and just confess his feelings. He is arrogant, but to take him down by a wire is pretty lame. Your post is really solid though, I think you really nailed it."
suits,2xyr2p,kaztrator,9,Thu Mar 5 23:45:11 2015 UTC,"They did it that way because that's how Gordon Gecko was taken down in the movie Wall Street because that movie is iconic in any profession where you could be called a ""Suit"""

suits,2xyr2p,rmsersen,2,Thu Mar 5 21:15:04 2015 UTC,I guess when I watched that scene I kind of assumed that Cahill gave Harvey (and Marcus) immunity in exchange for the bigger fish that is Forstman.  That doesn't seem too far-fetched to me.
suits,2xyr2p,Veshy,16,Thu Mar 5 08:03:34 2015 UTC,"Feeling kinda let down by that finale! I was expecting something bigger, like previous years."
suits,2xyr2p,Dzydvl,28,Thu Mar 5 06:16:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Look at previous finales (or mid-season breaks):  S1: Trevor tells Jessica about Mike. Huge ""oh shit"" moment, back before it got beaten to death and someone was finding out every four episodes.  S2: Mid-season break, Hardman gets fired. No big cliff-hanger, but Hardman was a bigger villain than Forstman, so the take-down had more gravity.  S2: Finale, the merger with Darby, and Mike tells Rachel the truth. Not as strong as S1, but the merger was a pretty big deal.  S3: Break, huge cliff-hanger with Louis in the Harvard file room, making us think he found out about Mike.  S3: Finale, Mike leaves the firm.  S4: Break, Louis really does find out about Mike.  I'd say tonight might be the weakest yet. Forstman is a smug asshole, and his downfall was satisfying to watch, but the drama was lacking - neither the firm nor any major character was ever in real trouble. Honestly wish they would have saved Donna's trial for this episode. Last week felt more like the finale than tonight did.  Otherwise, Jessica just moped around, Mike and Rachel took a logical next step, and Harvey and Donna are still moving at a glacial pace towards an inevitable romance.   That said, the flashbacks were enjoyable as always, and the Louis/Norma sidestory was touching. It wasn't a bad episode by any stretch....just not a great finale."

suits,2xyr2p,eonica,6,Thu Mar 5 06:23:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty good episode, in my opinion. I know this subreddit likes to bitch about characters being emotional instead of always badass, but I liked it.  Louis got choked up about Norma's death, prompting him to ask Donna to be his secretary. Harvey avoids addressing his feelings for Donna, and Donna ends up accepting Louis' offer so Harvey doesn't have an excuse to keeping avoiding those feelings. Rachel and Mike team up to help take down Forstman, and Forstman's own ego brings him down (in a twist reminiscent of the same movie that was referenced earlier, Wall Street).  I found Mike proposing to Rachel a little weird, but only because they're the youngest of the main characters and literally none of the others are married. I suppose them being young and not totally obsessed with their jobs actually helps in that regard, though.  All in all, I quite enjoyed the season finale. Looking forward to seeing what next season brings."

Now that she doesn't work for him he can't use that as an excuse not to date her. He was afraid to lose her completely if they dated, but she's taken that fear and made it a reality so now it really is ""all or nothing"". Am I interpreting this correctly?  OK so on to my real point: I feel like it's not really Harvey who has issues with dating while they work together, it's Donna. Are they both forgetting about her rule? The one that states she won't get involved with men that she works with? Going to work for Louis does not mean she can date Harvey now. Her rule apparently is a blanket rule that applies to any man who works for the same people she works for. That's why when she started dating Stephen Harvey accused her of 'changing' her rule i.e. making an exception for Stephen. Dating Stephen went against her rule and this is despite the fact that he was actually of the London office and was only in NYC for a few weeks. If THAT is breaking her rule then dating Harvey when she works for Louis would be crushing it to pieces.   So yea, I don't understand what she hopes to achieve by working for Louis. Even if Harvey was persuaded to pour his heart out to her, they couldn't do anything about it because she still works for the firm.   Sorry if I'm rambling, hope someone understands and can explain...  I just want her to forget the rule and date Harvey AND be his secretary. Is it wrong that I want this? Am I a horrible person?"

(Harvey and Donna) If Donna really wanted to leave Harvey she would have left the firm. The ""Mike's Secret"" plotline waxes and wanes, never going fully away. Norma pretty much died for the sole purpose of getting Mike to propose. Can opener will come up in season 5 but they will never reveal its purpose. non-answer about the Mike/Rachel wedding in season 5. Rachel's dad will be involved in a case in season 5. Donna will work for Louis for at least a few episodes.   There, saved you 20 minutes of reading blah blah can't say too much blah blah."

suits,2y0ijp,V2Blast,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"You should watch it! It's a Joss Whedon show, and it explores some very interesting themes. I loved it. Fox kinda doomed it from the start with the Friday night timeslot, but I'd imagine the dark subject matter turned some people off as well.  It barely got renewed for a second season because of its poor ratings, but I think the devoted fanbase (as well as the reaction from Whedon fans who'd previously been burned by Fox's cancellation of Firefly) convinced Fox to renew the show for a second season with the understanding that it would not get another one - so the second half of season 2 feels pretty rushed, but it pretty much wraps up all the major plot points. I thought the ending was quite good.  Definitely worth watching."

He got Mike to do the Liberty Rail law suit, is a Harvard professor and knows about his secret. Since viewers are getting tired of everyone and their mum finding out about Mike's secret it'd be a nice change of pace for him to actually go to Harvard somehow. When season 5 starts he'd be a proper lawyer. There's a few issues with this scenario though since people could still find out that he practiced law long before going to Harvard."
suits,2xotak,max96at,2,Tue Mar 3 15:28:30 2015 UTC,"Reflex reply is, ""It's the finale? Someone must find out about Mike."" But now everyone in the main cast knows so it's not cliffhanger material anymore. Plus we just had the same storyline in the midseason finale so I'm guessing/hoping they're not so out of ideas as to have the same thing again 6 episodes later.   I admit that what's got me on the edge of my seat is Darvey. If Donna confronts he'll either brush it off like she did in s2 ""oh you know, like a sister/friend"" OR they could actually talk about it and....maybe decide they want to try. But Donna's rule prohibits that. So...she goes to work for Louis?"

I have no idea) one of the things that seem to make a great lawyer is the ability to control your emotions at all times, come up with a game plan for the people you are opposing and always appear super confident even when you are getting your ass handed to you. Louis sucks at this and will never be able to rise above it. That is why people shit on Louis, they don't think he is Elite."

He screws up at times, agreed, most people do. Harvey's character to be brutally honest is a bit ""too good to be true"" types and in real life we find more of Luis than Harvey. And Luis is a brilliant lawyer and a great mentor too. Yes, his ways aren't the nicest but I believe he's been shit over at times without his fault. Felt he was hard done when Donna asks him to ""Just leave"" when he could have actually made the case simpler.  And tbqh, if it wasn't a TV show and a real life scenario, the odds of Louis getting Donna out of that mess was 5-10 folds higher than Harvey doing it. Infact there wouldn't have been a case had Harvey not been cocky in the DA's office about the ""Intent"" thing. I'm all for Harvey and his cockiness, the guy's an icon, a rolemodel but, as Harvey would say Louis is God damn brilliant too."

I feel like they casted all the right actors for their respective roles. But the writing... I'm just not a fan of. I feel like Suits could have been something amazing. Like something on the level of House of Cards. But I feel like the lack of character development has really hurt the show. Like Harvey. There is so much I want to know about him. I want to know more than just his time at the DA's office.  I feel like literally every episode is just a witty argument leading to a door slam. Leading to someone else finding out about mike.

suits,2xddwb,ReginaldKD,16,Mon Mar 2 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"Considering Harvey just had $500,000 in cash lying around when he got that promotion a few seasons ago, he's definitely making millions now. I remember a conversation between Jessica and Him stating something along the lines of 'you made all of that money back' in just the first bonus cheque. So yeah, they're all super loaded. And Harvey is living in a Penthouse in Manhattan, Jessica lives in what appears to be a fricken mansion on her own, and Mike's doing not-too bad either..  edit: I just realized that Harvey also paid for Scotty's $500,000 buy-in too. So yeah, definitely loaded."
suits,2xddwb,daavoo,11,Fri Feb 27 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"At the same time, the fact that 500k is the buyin kind of makes it seem like it's a lot of money. I seem to remember he had set that money aside for that moment. If he was making 3+ mil a year he wouldn't need to have that set aside.  Also, that was when he wasn't even a senior partner right? just a... regular one?"
suits,2xddwb,greg19735,-6,Sat Feb 28 06:34:57 2015 UTC,"At the same time, the fact that 500k is the buyin kind of makes it seem like it's a lot of money.

suits,2xddwb,greg19735,6,Sat Feb 28 06:34:57 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. Harvey, Jessica, and Louis are likely making really, really good money as they are running the firm. Seven figures, likely. Hard to say with Mike considering all of the drama surrounding him, his leaving the firm and coming back, etc. Probably a little above starting salary for an associate, which is around $160,000. Rachel is in law school and an associate, so it's hard to say what her pay is with all of that considered. Probably not making the starting salary for an associate since she has class and isn't an actual lawyer yet. And Harvey pays Donna's paycheck out of his own, as was stated in an earlier episode. I'd say she is making GREAT money for a secretary, probably six figures."
suits,2xddwb,Ewwbullterd,6,Fri Feb 27 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"I would set Harvey, Jessica and Lois even higher than seven figures. They are name partners at one of the bigest lawfirms in NY. Take a look at what top law firms make anually, even if the cut for name partner is extremly small(fe ~2%, honestly not sure what is normal, but it should be over 2%)you hit 8 figures."
suits,2xddwb,Freiyf,5,Fri Feb 27 21:17:06 2015 UTC,"When I said 7, I wasn't clear. I meant to say, generally, in the millions. Saying 7 wasn't clear, though. Yes, they're likely making tens of millions."
suits,2xddwb,Ewwbullterd,3,Fri Feb 27 22:27:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say they're one of the biggest, in fact probably more on the smaller side with a global reach. Show states that NY is the only location for the firm. It wouldn't make sense to house a shitload of lawyers in one location when they can put another office elsewhere. ."
suits,2xddwb,MyLeftNutItches,3,Sat Feb 28 03:35:01 2015 UTC,"Harvey only paid Donna's paycheck when he was an associate, as associates don't get secretary's. As a senior partner they get secretary's, so I think Donna's paycheck is coming from the firm by now. She would still get a shit ton of money though."
suits,2xddwb,Diderikvl,1 point,Sun Mar 1 13:15:32 2015 UTC,"I would say Jessica, Harvey and Louis are around 3-5 mil. Mike: 120-160k. Donna: 80k+ (plus all those bags and gifts she gets/buys with Harvey's credit card). Rachel: this one, I have no clue."
suits,2xddwb,GirlWonder01,4,Sat Feb 28 01:19:19 2015 UTC,Starting salary for an NYC biglaw lawyer is $160k. Why would you think Mike would be making as little as $120k?
suits,2xddwb,iheartgt,0,Sat Feb 28 04:37:14 2015 UTC,"well, the reasoning would be because he doesn't have a law degree. Though, he's probably making exactly above average if you know what I mean. THe firm can't have him on 80k a year because that's suspicious. He needs to be paid exactly what he's worth. He's a top class lawyer with little experience, he'll be paid like one."
suits,2xddwb,greg19735,5,Sat Feb 28 06:36:11 2015 UTC,What would be suspicious is a NYC big law firm paying its new associates anything other than the standard 160k + 15k lockstep. Because that's literally how every single big law firm regardless of prestige pays in NYC.
suits,2xddwb,sAfuRos,4,Sat Feb 28 09:06:41 2015 UTC,I bet Donna makes more than most associates.  Didn't Harvey and Donna split some sort of raise or bonus a few seasons back?

suits,2xcdp9,elausto,1 point,Fri Feb 27 13:40:04 2015 UTC,Yea that plot needs to be resolved or temporarily at bay for a season or two. It shouldn't go past this season.
suits,2xcdp9,TheFarnell,26,Fri Feb 27 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"In the ""real world"", lawyers specialize into one field of practice where they remember the law from constant repetition - it's not like they memorize the entire law.  For the rest, they just know the general guidelines and know where to quickly look for the details.  All those law books in their offices aren't just there for show (though with Internet databases today they probably are, but you get the point).  Harvey is described as a ""closer"" (whatever that means), so he's probably more of a jack-of-all-trades - which makes sense given the wide range of law he's practiced over the series.  That also means he probably doesn't have much of anything memorized and is just really good at looking through law databases and finding what he needs.  This also explains why he and Mike make such a good team - Mike is basically a walking instant-search database."

suits,2xcdp9,seanconnerysbeard,10,Sun Mar 1 11:20:18 2015 UTC,"With the fraud issue, how often does Harvey deal with something like that? He's a corporate lawyer, not a criminal one, so not remembering the elements for fraud 10 years after working in the DA's office isn't too farfetched. Or, as I always do, blame it on the show's crap writing."
suits,2xcdp9,Ewwbullterd,16,Fri Feb 27 13:16:27 2015 UTC,"This. And it wasn't that Harvey DIDN'T KNOW the five point test for felony fraud... he knew what they were. Mike just pointed out that in terms of the injury point, they wouldn't be able to say they were injured because then they'd have to admit what they did.  I think what it comes down to is Harvey is a great lawyer. Being a great lawyer is definitely something that is different to each person. But for Harvey, his clients almost always get what they want out of the deal OR he turns a very, very bad situation, one that could be extremely detrimental to the firm or clients, into one that is a much, much better alternative. Maybe it's that Harvey takes the cases that NO ONE else would be able to get out of or win, and that is what makes him great."
suits,2xcdp9,IINestorII,7,Fri Feb 27 19:39:55 2015 UTC,"I guess it's a compromise for the sake of the audience. They have to keep the characters struggling with a problem and at the end you need some kind of solution. But that solution can't be to technical, most of the audience hasn't got a harvard degree, but they want to understand it.  You could say the same about the scene with Mike and Rachel in Mikes office, where he is frustrated and can't find anyone who wants to talk about the accident ... and she has to point out the most obvious person to ask, the driver of the train.  Sometimes they have really great complex solutions, don't get me wrong, but I guess you can't have them always."

suits,2xcdp9,C4N4DI4N,4,Sun Mar 1 12:50:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, the the fact Mike knows them and Donna is definitely guilty means he's pissed because he loves her. In real life the associates to the grunt work, the senior/name partners have to deal with clients, hold depositions, go to court, negotiate settlements, etc. All of which is well above an associate's work. The essential chain of command is: Paralegals research and copy and shit, give it to associates to file and fill out subpoenas, etc., who give it to the partners who go and win the cases and use it against people to get shit done.  Edit: I should stress this is extremely dumbed down, but that's the general gist of it."

He had to leave because it was something more than platonic - why would he if they were just friends? Also the fact that ""fade into you"" was playing in the background...like c'mon.  but that being said i wouldn't be surprised if next episode they play it off and everything returns to status quo"

suits,2x6xtm,vreddy92,8,Thu Feb 26 23:47:04 2015 UTC,I think that was just motivation to get him to take the suit. They knew they'd force the settlement.
suits,2x6xtm,Ilyak1986,5,Thu Feb 26 23:53:36 2015 UTC,But they didn't even get a settlement. They dropped the case.
suits,2x6xtm,EmpyreanDraco,3,Thu Feb 26 04:46:05 2015 UTC,"Or it could just have been a settlement, since they had other fish to fry."
suits,2x6xtm,CptOswinOswald,23,Thu Feb 26 05:21:20 2015 UTC,Looks like Darvey might actually become a thing. Shippers rejoice!!
suits,2x6xtm,Kikool42,24,Thu Feb 26 06:23:20 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or have they not utilized ""that magnificent memory"" of Mike as much this season. As one with photographic memory like Mike, I enjoyed that part very much. It's not that the episodes have been bad, it's just that I miss that plot device."
suits,2x6xtm,blackyolo,9,Thu Feb 26 08:35:22 2015 UTC,Very true. Although I think even throughout the other seasons they haven't utilised it as much as i thought. For some reason I thought the show would be mainly about his eidetic memory since its so extraordinary.
suits,2x6xtm,kspecter,3,Thu Feb 26 05:17:04 2015 UTC,Well in that scene where Mike says they would need to tell what's in the papers in trial to show damage. He said that in such a way I don't think someone who did not study law could.
suits,2x6xtm,_Darren,19,Thu Feb 26 13:46:35 2015 UTC,Donna is gorgeous... I hope her and Harvey end up together.
suits,2x6xtm,peeinherbutt,4,Thu Feb 26 23:10:06 2015 UTC,"Harvey is praised by Donna and everyone else because he saved the day in the end but he was completely a jerk to Mike. He didn't really know how Donna got those files and he was trying to punish Liberty Rail for causing death of people despite Harvey was pressuring him to drop the case. Of course he could have chosen not to use any of them, he is not completely blameless but still it doesn't explain why Harvey's attitude towards him changes completely like Mike's mere existence at the firm was why Donna bullshitted her way through those files. This dialogue was especially shows why I think this:  ""And how is that different all the times you risked me?""  ""Because she's different.""  Yeah, I get it Harvey is in love with Donna and has always been and their relationship is completely different with the one with Mike.  But since the first season it has been depicted that Mike was like a brother to Harvey who would protect him when shit hits the fan. (Such as 3rd season finale) I get Harvey being furious with the case and frustrated with Donna but still it doesn't really explain him antagonizing Mike."
suits,2x6xtm,swanpiano,5,Fri Feb 27 03:13:03 2015 UTC,"Cause he lied to him. Never lie to Harvey and he will always protect you. He is punishing him for lying about the source and endangering Donna. If it was Mike who was in the shit, he would have put aside his anger and helped him. For the time being, let him feel shit about lying."
suits,2x6xtm,anetbricksoriginal,6,Thu Feb 26 04:14:11 2015 UTC,"Not sure if anyone is still reading these, but Donna really, really pissed me off when she went into Harvey's office. I get that she is scared, but it's super hypocritical of her to defend the shit out of him as long as it is someone else's ass on the line. That had to make him feel like shit  I still love her, though"
suits,2x6xtm,_Darren,9,Thu Feb 26 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"This is one of my favourite episodes of the season. As much as I love seeing Donna be a badass, it was nice to see the other side of her (without Louis being there) with her whole 'I just sit outside and answer the phones' speech."
suits,2x6xtm,knuxgen,6,Fri Feb 27 02:21:49 2015 UTC,"That speech felt really out of character for me, in a bad way. But then again I'm a huge fan of Donna's badassery."

So glad to see more of her this week and I will readily admit I'm a total Donna and Harvey shipper so I was digging all the undertones there throughout the episode.  On the flip side, I'm sorry I continue to be bored by Jeff and Jessica. Jessica is totally kick a$$ and I've never found Jeff to be a good fit for her.   Why oh why does everyone keep putting up with Mike? I get that's the point of the show but it just is getting more and more ridiculous that they'd keep putting their neck out for him. Go to Harvard and find a REAL lawyer you can have as a protegee Harvey!"

Now she is pissed and probably thinking ""that probably wasn't the first time his secretary did something bad and he covered it up"". Let's hope she doesn't start digging."

He loves her so much...but I have a feeling they'll pretend it never happened or Harvey will press and Donna will push him away.

suits,2x6eer,gubbsbe,10,Thu Feb 26 00:39:47 2015 UTC,I don't think the creators ever meant for Donna and Harvey to be a thing. But to appease parts of the fanbase they started this whole Donna/Harvey angle. It's unfortunate if the writers go down this road wealthy powerful man sleeping with his secretary wow never seen that storyline in my life sarcasm
suits,2x6eer,Peanutbutta33,24,Thu Feb 26 03:28:40 2015 UTC,"Donna was with him before he all his success. They worked together at the DAs before Harvey fast tracked at (then) Pearson Hardman. If anything, he's always treated her as an equal.  Yeah I'm a shipper lol. But to each their own. I'm not reading to much into it, of course I wanted him to say that he 'loves her' but the writers just write these two in a way to bring them crashing back down. It'll be a mistake, caught in the moment or they'll (or one of them) will sweep it under the rug."
suits,2x6eer,GirlWonder01,13,Thu Feb 26 07:27:08 2015 UTC,"Oh please.  They've been pushing this since the very beginning. Characters have made reference to the tension between Harvey and Donna since the very beginning and every time Harvey and Donna just coyly deflect the comments. Or they become pointedly defensive denying it. They never just soberly deny it.  Either the writers, producers, and actors are all completely terrible and that was all just a series of mistakes, or they meant to push the idea of a potential relationship between the two of them.  And then it was revealed that they had slept together once in the past. And how do they discuss it? Do they just say ""oh hey, it was fun but it wasn't a big deal and we didn't continue it""? No. It was pretty clearly a big deal.  The show harps on their special relationship constantly. Almost every interaction they have is filled with sexual tension.  None of this is a mistake. The creators definitely, absolutely meant for Harvey and Donna to have some sort of romantic/sexual dynamic and it shouldn't be at all surprising that they've finally gotten around to exploring that and elaborating on it in the fourth season.  I don't think ""parts of the fanbase"" saw something that wasn't there and demanded to be appeased, I think you are ignoring the obvious signs that have been there since the very beginning simply because you wish things were otherwise."
suits,2x6eer,M0dusPwnens,-4,Thu Feb 26 09:03:21 2015 UTC,"It's clear Donna has always carried a torch for Harvey but Harvey at least to me placed her into the friendship box. If Scotty and Zoe had not left Donna wouldn't even be in play. She' spent over a decade knowing every detail of his life, weathered him through break-ups, and probably scheduling even some of his hook-ups. The night after sleeping together Harvey's first inclination is to offer a job instead of pursuing a relationship.  So it's pretty established that Harvey hasn't exactly been living like a monk while pinning away for Donna. So it's just sad that after a decade of Donna (most likely waiting) and Harvey essentially getting rejected by the one woman he loved and by another whom he spent years pursuing, he says fuck it I'll just make a play for Donna.   I think them being together is like throwing in the towel. Donna has always been a sure and safe bet for Harvey."
suits,2x6eer,Peanutbutta33,10,Thu Feb 26 12:00:05 2015 UTC,"My reading of the situation was very different - I got the sense that Harvey reacting by offering her the job and dating other women was because he was scared by his legitimate feelings for Donna, especially given their existing, long-standing relationship.  A lot is made in the series of Harvey's emotional immaturity - the tension between that and his totally-in-control, cool-guy image has been a big part since the beginning."
suits,2x6eer,M0dusPwnens,7,Thu Feb 26 12:13:15 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I think that when Harvey offered her the job is because he somehow didn´t want to lose her.
suits,2x6eer,Silvia75,2,Thu Feb 26 12:22:12 2015 UTC,That one night meant more that he thought.
suits,2x6eer,Silvia75,2,Thu Feb 26 12:22:51 2015 UTC,He wanted a way to keep her around without having to immediately confront his feelings for her or the risk they presented to their existing relationship.
suits,2x6eer,M0dusPwnens,1 point,Fri Feb 27 00:01:47 2015 UTC,"If Harvey was just having one night stands I might agree with you. But he clearly had legit feelings for both Scotty and Zoe so he's not totally emotionally stunted. He made himself vulnerable with both women only to get hurt in the end.   Also 10 plus years is a fuck ton of time to be scared. Additionally, Donna has always been more of a gurantee than the two women Harvey put himself out there for. Zoe flat out rejected Harvey repeatedly when they worked together. Scotty equally accomplished professionally, beautiful, and had a fiancé when she slept with Harvey. So if he was scared of putting himself out there why would he do it for two women that were 50/50 at best?"
suits,2x6eer,Peanutbutta33,2,Thu Feb 26 12:32:05 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have to be totally emotionally stunted.  The show has pretty clearly been trying to make this a progression in his character development. You're absolutely right that he opened himself up to Zoe and Scotty - and that's exactly what lead him to this point where he's able to confess to Donna.  It's not just that he's scared of ""putting himself out there"" (although he absolutely was - which was why Donna and others made such a big deal about his relationships with Zoe and Scotty), it's that he's scared of a relationship with Donna. The fact that he's known her so long make it more scary, not less. He is obviously a lot closer to Donna that he was to Scotty for instance."
suits,2x6eer,M0dusPwnens,-1,Fri Feb 27 00:00:40 2015 UTC,"Also I think on many TV shows fans see two attractive colleagues/friends working together and immediately jump to ""oh they should totally date"". So every little interaction is perceived as underlining sexual tension. I get why a lot of fans root for a relationship with these two because a lot of fans probably relate to Donna. The nice girl/guy that just wants their charismatic, uber attractive friend to finally see them in the light of a potential love interest."
suits,2x6eer,Peanutbutta33,3,Thu Feb 26 14:18:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not rooting for a relationship at all. In fact, I would rather they didn't - the Harvey-Donna dynamic is really interesting and actually making it more explicit seems likely to spoil it.  But it's still pretty obvious that they've been leading up to this for a long time. The seeds have been planted since practically the first episode and they've been occasionally watering them throughout the whole series.  It isn't just people seeing what they want to see. It isn't just ""appeasing"" the fans. It isn't just a spur-of-the-moment thing they're introducing here."
suits,2x6eer,M0dusPwnens,0,Thu Feb 26 23:56:05 2015 UTC,"If by leading up to it you mean Donna waiting literally over an decade for Harvey to realize his feelings while simultaneously banging half of the women in NYC and falling in love with a few other women.   Now if Harvey ran off with Mike I would find that more believable. He's put his entire career, wealth, and reputation on line for Mike. At the end of last season he was ready to take the blame if Mike was caught. And he was all heart broken when Mike told him about taking the Investment Banking job. Dropped a big multi million dollar client (Logan) basically because Mike hated him. I personally I think he had Rachel acting as his Associate to keep some kind of connection with Mike. And this all for a kid he met three years ago....  I'm just pointing out the contrast of these two relationships to say how easy it is to interpret friend/colleague interactions into some kind of romantic connections."
suits,2x6eer,Peanutbutta33,0,Fri Feb 27 01:16:14 2015 UTC,"I confess I love Harvey and Donna and I would love them to end up together. But the problem here is the teasing and not really wanting to go there with them. Aaron said himself in a tweet (if I am not wrong) that they more they give (regarding Harvey and Donna) the more fans will want but IMO the more they wait less believable will be.  I don´t think that after this episode the relationship between them will change, things will be the same. They just put things out there to keep people guessing and that´s all."

suits,2x7da8,nuggetbridge,5,Thu Feb 26 05:41:21 2015 UTC,This show is not in any danger. I have watched it from the beginning and I also look at television show rankings and it is top 15 on a lot of lists. I think since it is mid week and really not very late at night some people either put it on the DVR or use other ways to watch. For example USA network puts it on their website by the next morning and that is where I usually watch. So all I am saying is prime time ratings aren't everything.

suits,2ws7r9,TIWame,12,Sun Feb 22 18:51:59 2015 UTC,"How do you fake a Law degree when you already have one? It just wouldn't work. He would have to erase all records of being at Columbia but you can't erase people's memory.  Also it doesn't seem likely that anyone would go through all that trouble if they don't need to, I mean it's not the only law firm around."
suits,2ws7r9,BlitzTank,4,Sun Feb 22 19:07:19 2015 UTC,"I think that when Professor Gerard looked up mike he saw that mike was in the Harvard Database (He was put in by Lola the hacker girl in season 1) and as a professor he can probably access his transcript and see that he got an A in his class. But then in his own records, grades and class registry and all that, there is no trace of mike.   For Louis, if you remember that was his initial though when found out mike didn't have a file in Harvard filing room mid season three. There is a scene where he is talking to himself saying ""what if he didn't go to harvard, what if he just when to some third tier law school...""   But then he request mikes transcript from Harvard. Proving that mike went to Harvard (or went through a lot of trouble to pretend he did).  Hence this season, when Louis realises that mike doesn't recognise the key, he comes to the conclusion that Mike would not have gone through all the effort to fake Harvard Transcript and records if he had gone to another law school and thus must not have gone to any. ( I would have to rewatch the episode but I am also pretty sure Louis never explicitly states Mike never when to Law school when he confronts Donna or Jessica. He just calls him a fraud and says he never went to harvard)"

If harvey had ""bent"" the rules to allow mike join from a different college, no laws would have been broken, like Rachel did with Jessica, so why fake a degree then?

suits,2wl73p,MightyMorph,5,Fri Feb 20 21:12:04 2015 UTC,"im just tired of how self-righteous and selfish mike is. He can have a very lucrative life doing ANYTHING else, but he continues being a lawyer putting all of his friends and all of his cases and everyone he is supposed to be ""helping"" not to mention the woman he loves in a position where they will lose everything and more than likely end up in jail, over his obsession with being a lawyer.  By this time i mean too many people know for it to remain contained. Its going to come out in the end.   AND goddamn its annoying every time he berates harvey and starts his mopey road of being a ""honest"" and ""humanitarian"" guy. Especially in the latest episode. When he said i became a lawyer to help people. I thought to myself, ""fucking liar, you became a lawyer because you're a selfish twat.""   I just think they either need to rewrite or basically grow him the fuck up, or they should have just tossed him off the show and continued with being a lawfirm drama show with harvey and the rest of the guys as main roles."
suits,2wl73p,Peanutbutta33,3,Sat Feb 21 00:24:33 2015 UTC,Agreed x1000000
suits,2wl73p,JaminBorn,2,Sat Feb 21 00:56:07 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said here. That's why I found it so satisfying when Louis put him in a headlock and practically choked him out.
suits,2wl73p,BlitzTank,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:36:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah that line about becoming a lawyer to help people made me snort, I thought he became a lawyer because he accidentally ran into an interview and he's never given a fuck about helping people till now"
suits,2wl73p,ReflexMan,1 point,Sat Feb 21 05:19:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I somewhat agree with the notion that Mike didn't become a lawyer to help people, but for himself.  HOWEVER, your point about him running into an interview by accident is false. He clearly wanted to be a lawyer long before that. That event was serendipity. If he had accidentally run into interviews for some business position, or being a doctor, or anything else, he would have hid from the cop and then left. But because he found himself in a lawyer interview, he decided to shoot for it, because he had been interested in the law for a long time. (This is all evidenced by the flashback episodes)"
suits,2wl73p,BlitzTank,3,Sat Feb 21 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's something iffy about Donna in that last episode, what she did was just so out of the blue and uncharacteristic, they made it out like it wasn't a big deal but s4e14"
suits,2wl73p,ReflexMan,3,Sat Feb 21 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS  Agreed. Donna breaking in there to steal the evidence is something I compare to Louis fucking up in the thing with Nigel because of the cat. In both cases, it was the writers taking some aspect of the character that is usually reserved for the secondary story lines (for humor), and randomly implanting them in the primary story line, and it feels weird.  In the case of Louis, we have the Louis who does silly stuff with Rachel as a secondary story line, and while some people might think it's too cheesy, others might get a kick out of it. But then there is Louis when he is involved with the main story line, and while he might not always be 100% competent, he isn't the kind to let a fucking cat ruin a huge settlement agreement. So when they did that, it was very strange.  This is that all over again. It makes perfect sense for Donna to have that ""I am an untouchable, perfect goddess of everything"" attitude when it is about something not important. It's funny I guess when she seems to know everything about everything, because ""I'm Donna"". But again, that's the kind of thing for unimportant secondary story type stuff. When Donna is involved in real shit, she's a lot more real because it's serious. When the writers have her go steal something like it's nothing, and be all ""I'm Donna, I am magic,"" it's really strange and just feels dumb.  Both of these cases felt like they really shoehorned a way to cause drama.  END SPOILERS"
suits,2wl73p,BlitzTank,1 point,Sat Feb 21 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"Regarding Louis and the cat, you're right, I also thought that at the time. In fact I feel like they've been blurring the lines between silly Louis and serious Louis a lot since then and it's kind of ruining his character. Since the beginning he was set up as Harvey's rival but since they decided to make him ""the bad guy"" in this season they've turned him into an incompetent buffoon. He's supposed to be a top class lawyer, I wonder when/if we'll ever see that again."

I'm sick of him acting like Harvey owes him everything. Harvey has put his career on the line for Mike on multiple occasions and Mike still bitches every time Harvey does something he doesn't like."
suits,2wl73p,Peanutbutta33,3,Sat Feb 21 16:56:55 2015 UTC,"I know Suits are probably aghast at such an idea but honestly the Mike character has completely put hamstrung the show's creativity. Every storyline ends with a new person learning Mike's secret. Season 2 Jessica found out, season 3 Rachel finds out, season 4 Louis finds out. Professor Gerard knows, Trevor knows, Scotty knows, and by season end Jeff might know.  Mike's fraud is about as much as a secret as Kim Kardishian' sex life."

Also, why does Mike seem to have an emotional meltdown every time he's on a case? So, maybe not without Mike, but I think they need to rethink Mike's character"

suits,2we1m5,kspecter,1 point,Thu Feb 19 07:46:18 2015 UTC,"The show needs to stop going to the shady quick fixes that take 3 more episodes to resolve. Mike should've lost the case because he was by all means beaten nobody could've done anything more and that's fine and would round out his character a bit more if he couldn't always save everyone. Plus him snapping at Harvey for not backing him up is like jumping back a season or two, same with Louis who can't decide if he wants to be a bastard or comic relief.  That said, i'm quite liking Malone, he's effectively a good guy caught up in everyone's problems."

The groundwork was already there from the case when LOUIS was all heartbroken not showing up to work and Rachel/Katrina covered. Really the core relationship is Mike/Harvey let them do their bromance/mentorship. But imo the better option would be Jessica taking Rachel under her wing, all that nonsense with Logan I firmly believe Jessica would have shut that down from the beginning.

Even she's barely on the show lately so there isnt enough to discuss. And I assume that you are pretty biased by the fact that her character is still a bitch who cheated on her bf even if every one on the show has made some pretty bad mistakes.

suits,2w2qzi,Sakheteu,4,Mon Feb 16 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"Fair point. So I looked up the definition of disapprove, and it states:  To have an unfavorable opinion of; condemn.  To refuse to approve; reject.  So it can indeed go both ways, depending on the context. I still think it is slightly weird to have your boss doing what they disapprove of. But like Cvraman said, ""do as I say, not as I do""."

suits,2w0i5l,filthyneckbeard,2,Mon Feb 16 08:43:07 2015 UTC,The most recent one. Harvey asked Louis to help him find something to get McKernon to win in all that documentation. Presumably he did.
suits,2w0i5l,vreddy92,3,Mon Feb 16 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"After that hearing, Harvey and Louis worked together and figured out how to help McKernon win."
suits,2w0i5l,GirlWonder01,5,Mon Feb 16 13:26:22 2015 UTC,Harvey ended up winning the case for McKernon against Fletcher. He played right into Hardmans hand and did what was best for him (win) and his client not the firm in general. It wasn't about bringing in new business it was about doing whatever it took.
suits,2w0i5l,Swaggarwal,13,Sun Feb 15 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"It was actually the opposite - Hardman gave Louis the Junior Partner position because he was the one who did the best thing for the firm no matter what it took (selling out Harvey's trial strategy). The idea was to get McKernon Motors to drop the firm (since Harvey wouldn't drop them) and allow the firm to sign a much bigger competitor (who the firm likely could not simultaneously represent due to a conflict of interest).  I would assume that once McKernon Motors heard what happened, they decided to keep Harvey and the firm as a client regardless since he demonstrated extreme loyalty."
suits,2w0i5l,GirlWonder01,9,Mon Feb 16 01:20:29 2015 UTC,"Are you guys sure?   I interpreted it as:  Harvey had to have won for McKernon to keep him in the end. Flecther Engines didn't win even though Louis gave them Harvey's strategy.  Harvey went against what Hardman wanted him to do (drop McKernon). He put his need of loyalty/winning ahead of the firm and won the case.   This is how/why Louis made Jr.partner before him. Louis was willing to do whatever it for the betterment of the firm, not for himself.   Jessica's conversation with Donna near the end sums it up IMO, in their eyes (Jessica/Hardman) as named partners Harvey was acting selfishly. That is why Jessica didn't defend him, she told Donna that his time would come but he had to learn to put the firm above himself."

suits,2vz0hm,tinhtinh,3,Sun Feb 15 15:56:06 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. I started about 3 weeks ago and finally caught up so it's a bit of a blur between episodes and seasons.   The first season is quite episodic and fun but later seasons have a overarcing storyline. The second season is better and probably has the best antagonist and some great exchanges. 3 meanders a bit and you'll have to leave your logic behind for some of it, though 4 is a lot stronger, its not perfect and inconsistent. Its still worth watching for the all the little scenes in between.  However one thing that doesn't go away is the formula of Mike hitting a brick wall, talks to someone else, something the other person says or does will trigger an epiphany and episode saving legal twist occurs."

Then the finale. Cahill comes to Harvey, they kick Woodall and Forstman's ass - or so they think.

What I'm confused about it... Let's just assume for the time being the seasons are each a real world year. How is it possible that in season 2 they had a flashback to 5 years prior to the events occurring in that episode and 2 years later in season 4 they had a flashback 6 years earlier. Now as I said if each season was one real world year, the 6 years later episode would of actually been 4 years prior to the ""year"" the events of season 2 occurred. Does that make sense or am I just confusing everyone? So if you count back 6 years from season 4, taking into account that we are assuming each season is one real world ""year""  Do you understand what I'm trying to say or am I just being confusing?

suits,2vuw70,walterpinkman45,2,Sat Feb 14 09:04:26 2015 UTC,Well this episode definitely got my attention so maybe I'll wait to forget the plot points and watch it all from the start. Butch or Sundance makes alot more sense. I was thinking the Sundance Film Festival since I only caught the last word and that one word happened to have multiple meanings.
suits,2vuw70,Kaurajuoma,6,Sat Feb 14 20:18:00 2015 UTC,Watch it all from the start (season 1). It is worth it.
suits,2vuw70,SyntheticDiz,4,Sat Feb 14 14:16:27 2015 UTC,Is there a tipping point where the writing gets lackluster? People in the main thread are saying the last couple episodes have been a resurgence so there must have been a downward trend somewhere.
suits,2vuw70,V2Blast,5,Sat Feb 14 20:14:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know when that happened. People on this sub say that season 3 was lackluster, but I have enjoyed every episode. Depends on what you're looking for I guess, but the end of season 3/start of season 4 was less about solving cases and more about interpersonal drama, which is something a lot of people didn't like."

Have mike try to impress his boss with a far more grey area deal while dealing with the morality and having to convince Harvey to go along, but ultimately going to Louis to get the deal done. That would have been infinitely better interesting than the useless love triangle.  That said, he had to go back to PSL. That's the point of the show and how his secret is finally revealed/resolved is the only way to end the series in a satisfying way."

I pretty much forgot the rest of the episode because that was basically the first time she used the proper term for genetalia outside of birds&bees talks. and I'm a dude in my mid 20s.

And to clarify it's not like she is some kind of God-fearing religious type, but she's never been quite so blunt about sex like that. I guess the fact that her youngest is 18 and she is counting the few years before retirement has removed the filter completely."

The fact that she was in law school at the time is a perfect segway to the present - easy to believe she's now a lawyer somewhere in New York. She'll cross paths with Mike again, and she'll know that Mike never went to law school, much less Harvard.  I just hope they wait a while before bringing her back. I'd like at least a few episodes of old-style Suits before we bring back Mike's secret as the central storyline."

While Mike and Louis worked their shit out way too quickly, we're finally (it seems) getting back to the way Suits started and that is fantastic after the last two seasons.  It was also nice to see some more backstory between Mike and Trevor and just to have a Grammy storyline. Getting Jenny back would have been icing on the cake."
suits,2vlz0n,5minUsername,21,Thu Feb 12 04:10:40 2015 UTC,"I dont think they worked their shit out way too quickly. They had a physical fight and usually after you have a fight with your friends things tend to be worked out.  You just let go of all the aggression.  Also I think I noticed that Louis was more angry at himself with the whole illegal paperwork thing from earlier this season and now this whole mike secret. He feels he's no longer clean and his firm is in danger.   Edit: Line that I just made up, could be used in the dialouge.  Harvey: ""Louis, you tried to build the biggest skyscraper in the world, but you used the foundation to build the ceiling!... Don't come crying to me when it all comes crashing down!"""

I'm picturing later this season that she's a lawyer as well now and will be representing a client against Mike/Harvey, and they'll rekindle that old spark when she sees what Mike's become career and life-wise. And then Mike has the decision of either ditching Rachel (oh god please do it) or sticking by her side and not having a repeat of the Logan drama from last season."
suits,2vlz0n,Shadoscuro,10,Thu Feb 12 12:56:20 2015 UTC,"That would be all sorts of neat. Besides, her and Partick's chemistry is natural, and they've been a joy to watch."

I'm absolutely positive that's going to work, just like it did all those other times!  Edit: (Just going to be adding edits instead of posting new comments I guess)  These flashbacks really demonstrate how the whole Harvey v Louis dynamic took off. I would be so demoralized if I was Louis. Just a bit too late, buddy.  Edit: Are you telling me that Mike knows EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING yet he doesn't know how to drive?! ... Mike...  Edit: Pull the car over right now, I'm going to beat the shit out of him. Yeah, that sums up pretty much everything I feel about Louis lately.  Edit: Okay, holy shit, Louis is totally capable of beating the shit out of Mike instead. And those were some interesting choice of words. If I remember correctly, ""You ruined my life. You ruined my firm."" Just, damn. This whole show is just a struggle between hating and pitying Louis. I don't know how to feel.  Final Edit: Honest opinion here... They ""worked their shit out"" way too fast. They're fighting, Louis is crying, and now instantly Louis says Mike isn't a fraud. All it took was Mike saying he was sorry? Not quite sure how I feel about that. Reply if you see something that I don't. Still, I would definitely be happy if they stopped bickering all the time. That would be pretty nice.   I miss Granny though. And that little scene between Rachel and Jessica was so sweet. I love Rachel. Way too much.  ""I don't trust you as far as I could throw you, you're a goddamn fraud.  ""That's what I said. Oh thanks God for that conversation too.  So, other than how quickly they worked their shit out, I really liked the outcome of that episode. I definitely like Louis more when he's not being an insufferable asshole. Good episode! Can't wait for next week."
suits,2vlz0n,Mo0man,37,Thu Feb 12 03:17:25 2015 UTC,"A physical altercation, even a minor one, often helps people just bring the walls down. All this sorrow and frustration, louis finally voiced it and that's really all he needed to get to the forgiveness stage...  He looked up everything about mike, subconciously he was ready to forgive him because, like he said, Mike isn't a fraud. Everything Mike said was true, other than having gone to law school.  I thought them making up went pretty well in my opinion. Even Louis choice of words was pretty solid- it makes it seems like MAYBE Louis wants to get him to Lawschool., not just for Mike's sake, but for the firm as well."
suits,2vlz0n,fresasandcrema,3,Thu Feb 12 04:15:41 2015 UTC,"Thing is, can Mike even go now? Wouldn't people be suspicious as to why he's in law school...it raises too many suspicions and all the cases he worked would be reopened."
suits,2vlz0n,fresasandcrema,11,Thu Feb 12 06:43:47 2015 UTC,harvey mentioned this in an earlier episode or season...the best option would go to a no name law school in the middle of nowhere
suits,2vlz0n,ScorpiusMalfoy,1 point,Thu Feb 12 08:32:18 2015 UTC,Maybe he could get an online degree lol
suits,2vlz0n,veils1de,2,Fri Feb 13 05:35:25 2015 UTC,"Plus, they would clearly see that his graduation date is after all those solved cases, meaning they would all be reopened, plus he would go to jail for practicing without a license anyway"

suits,2vlz0n,architrave,6,Thu Feb 12 03:37:29 2015 UTC,"if they didn't physically fight (and louis coming out on top), i would have called it lazy writing on how quickly they worked things out  the story arc was louis got beat by mike (taking back whatever that pharma company was that would have given louis a job with robert zane), meanwhile mike gets to stay at pearson spector. then louis finds out mike was a fraud all along, so he's definitely feeling demoralized, especially after just getting fired. i dont know if louis winning the physical fight was key, but it'd at least give him enough of a moral victory to admit that mike isn't a fraud  regardless, i felt this was a great episode. watching harvey mediate louis and mike the way a dad would mediate two hot tempered brothers is pretty comical. if louis and harvey keep their bromance, it'd be one of the most satisfying bromances i'd have ever seen on television"

suits,2vlz0n,parbz,10,Thu Feb 12 10:47:09 2015 UTC,"I think the ""ruined his life"" is alluding to him being a fraud in the first place, which puts the firm (which is essentially Louis's life) at risk if anyone finds out."
suits,2vlz0n,DivineVodka,8,Thu Feb 12 18:44:11 2015 UTC,"In previous episodes, Louis makes it (obnoxiously) clear that he loves the firm more than (almost) anything.

suits,2vlz0n,V2Blast,3,Thu Feb 12 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"Well most schools usually ask for referrals to disciplinary boards, expulsions, and criminal convictions.    Law schools especially ask for this and so do bar admissions.  Bar admissions in particular additionally ask for acts of dishonesty as well even if there's no conviction.  Omissions of these would not only result in denying acceptance even IF you pass the exam for lack of fitness to practice, but will most definitely result in disbarment if found after admission to the bar.  Rule being, better to fully disclose everything early on than to have bar admissions ask why you were hiding shit.  source: admitted to my state's bar."

I'm not American so I have to say I don't really know the American college system very well, and I can't remember if Mike gets kicked out of high school or his undergrad, but surely being kicked out of one school doesn't mean he can't get his GED or go to another undergrad and reapply to Yale/Columbia/Any other ivy league school.

The degree is earned by completing law school in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other common law countries. Many who hold the degree of Juris Doctor are professionals committed to the practice of law, and may choose to focus their practice on criminal law, tort, family law, corporate law, and/or a wide range of other areas.  The majority of individuals holding a J.D. must pass an examination in order to be licensed to practice law within their respective jurisdictions.      The degree was first awarded in the United States in the late 19th century and was created as a modern version of the old European doctor of law degree (such as the Dottore in Giurisprudenza in Italy and the Juris Utriusque Doctor in Germany and Central Europe).  Originating from the 19th century Harvard movement for the scientific study of law, it is a law degree that in most common law jurisdictions is the primary professional preparation for lawyers. It is a three-year program in most jurisdictions.      Image i - Example of a diploma from Suffolk University Law School conferring the Juris Doctor degree.

Then go to another law school. Ok his chances of Harvard are gone. But maybe one of the other Ivys would've accepted him, or at least ONE of the many law schools in any other state would have. I know Harvard is portrayed as The One And Only in the show but really if he wanted to be a lawyer he could've gone elsewhere.

I started to lose interest midway through s3 but just wanted to know what happened.  The mid season finale was amazing and restored my faith. I watched s 4 ep 11 and was completely underwhelmed. I would have thought the show would have started stronger. I will continue to watch, but it's not a priority."
suits,2vlx8x,CSMastermind,7,Thu Feb 12 16:39:54 2015 UTC,Suits has lost alot of viewers that might be part of the reason.

Out of most the shows I've watched or seen suits is probably my favorite, maybe only beat out by SoA. I really love the actors, their characters and the plot."

It doesn't seem as smart as it once was.  I think for me it was the interactions outside of the office in the last episode that made it for me.  So much of the show now is in the office or in somebody's apartment with somebody from the office.  It's nice to see some outsiders every once in awhile."

Harvey did a job for Prof but partly to cover his/Mikes ass, Lois got that woman, sent a letter to the board and that was it, Rachel helped fix it but all off camera kinda stuff."

Also characters like Donna and Louis have become extremely one dimensional. Their tunnel vision stops them from growing and it feels like the show has stalled. Louis for example still cant handle his shit and evolve into a better character. Hes just a raging lunatic at every chance he gets. No one can be that stupid to put himself in a shitty situation every single chance they get and still wonder why they're treated bad. Tunnel vision."

suits,2v5b1m,tomoniki,26,Sun Feb 8 02:46:26 2015 UTC,Yeah the show was great as a procedural drama that had a heavily serialized character story. Now it is just a serialized drama and the original writers don't seem to be really cut out for making that shift.

suits,2v5b1m,awkgenius,4,Sun Feb 8 10:35:22 2015 UTC,They can fix it by stopping these stupid mid season breaks and returning for a measly 6 episode run and then gone for another 10 months. How can you even get a decent plot going? Oh yeah - it starts at the beginning of the episode and ends at the end.
suits,2v5b1m,deliriousidoit,5,Tue Feb 10 01:36:27 2015 UTC,"To everyone that says the beginning was a lot better, could you highlight some plots or subplots that are actually better than what's happening now?   I feel like people are being unnecessarily negative about ""where the show has gone"". I, for one, still really enjoy watching it!  Also, I don't mind if you downvote me because you disagree, but please at least post to tell me what exactly made the first and/or second season so much better."
suits,2v5b1m,sunstersun,6,Tue Feb 10 22:29:16 2015 UTC,"Personally, I liked it when it was more episodic. I liked it when Mike finished in one night what should've taken him a week to do. I liked it when they emphasized his intelligence and eidetic memory and actually used it.  I liked it when the show didn't revolve around drama, and around Mike's secret. I liked it when it didn't only have a few choice characters in Harvey, Jessica, Donna, Mike, Rachel, and Louis. Pearson Hardman Specter Litt Blah Blah is supposed to be a top tier selective law firm, yet every decision we see is being made by a couple people. No other senior partners are shown. No associates are shown.  Remember when Mike had somewhat of a rival? Remember when he had relationships with other people he worked with other than the aformentioned few? I liked that. I liked when they showed other senior partners, like the one Harvey pissed off. It showed that there was more to the firm than just the few people at the very top.  The show also went crazy with names. I'm not so sure I'd be in a hurry to hire a law firm when they've had major restructuring of their named partners done, what, five times in a couple years? That shows incompetence, infighting, and instability. That is not a law firm you want handing your cases. It's just bad writing.  As it stands now, almost everything Mike does can be done by any good Harvard trained attorney. He's nothing special in regards to the people around him, he brings nothing to the table that another Harvard attorney wouldn't also bring.  This show used to be about lawyers practicing law in New York, one under false pretenses (but he still deserved the opportunity because he was so good at his job). Now it's a standard workplace drama that happens to take place in a law firm. Like all USA shows, the writers went off the deep end and got rid of what made the show so likeable in the first place. And like most USA shows, it's going to be cancelled before its time because of that."

I certainly wouldn't have understood the dynamic between donna and harvey if the flashback of them working together hadn't shown the sexual tension or them sleeping together, etc."
suits,2v8emd,cocoaboots,7,Mon Feb 9 10:32:52 2015 UTC,"Total opposite. I saw the previews and immediately thought ""Fuck yes flashback episode!!!""  These characters have grown so much and we see them every week as what they are now. But every once in a while, its nice to go back and see where they came from.    Mike basically has a superpower brain and its cool to go back and see what he used it for in his past.  Harveys past cases, and nemeses Donna and Harvey love history Jessica/Hardmin and the history of the firm   Flashbacks are one of my favorite forms of storytelling."
suits,2v8emd,Topshot27,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:47:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you are wrong for feeling this way, just that you must view things differently. It seems like you are the kind of person who really enjoys a plot that moves quickly, and you don't enjoy characters, character development, etc. as much.  Flashbacks are absolutely not lazy, and they don't waste time. They just aim for something that you, in particular, might not be looking for. They offer a lot of insight into why the characters currently act the way they do.  I wonder how you felt about LOST. If you watched it, I am not interested in your views on the ending, but more did you enjoy the show as it ran, mainly the first season. The first season was pretty divisive. Many still praise it for being the best season, and others say that it was terrible and moved too slowly. From what I can tell, this divide comes from that difference in what we look for. People who enjoy characters and character development LOVED the first season of LOST, because it developed the characters very well, and the flashbacks were a great tool for that. The people who hated the first season of LOST are the kinds who are only interested in plot, and hated that ""nothing happened"" all season long.  As I said before, neither view is necessarily right or wrong. I just imagine you are the kind who wants plot progression over character work. The flashback episodes on this show do a TON for people who love characters, but they unfortunately don't do a lot for people like you."

But it seems to me that everyone finds out that he has never gone to Harvard. So why not just lie and say he went to some unknown law school, that no one has heard of once he's been caught in the ""haven't been to Harvard"" lie.   Someone may have answered this, but seriously, they've made the exception with Rachel. And sure some backwater law school versus Columbia is different. But having seen the work he's done, the exception should be that good lawyers will always be good, doesn't matter what school they come from.   Sure there is the fact that he's electronically in the system now. And Mike (I think, but don't quote me on this) showed Litt his transcript, but he could've easily said he photo shopped it or something. And it would make sense that he doesn't really know any of Harvard's traditions or places to go. Or the fact that he's not in the physical book keeping system.  I mean, had Litt saw that, his only case was that it broke was just a by-law which is just a self-regulation rule that companies create to make sure they don't break any federal/state law, and usually they're much more strict than those federal/state laws. I mean sure, it's a big deal breaking a company's by-laws, but it's still not as bad as breaking federal law. Which is where I think Litt got most of his power play from. Another thing, you can always amend by-laws, and Jessica could probably put that into motion in some round about ways. Like, Harvard isn't the best law school in the world anymore. That title belongs to Yale (which would be a sucker punch for all those guys), and Stanford just edged out Harvard (less of a punch). Or some shit like that."

We pause everytime a new scene starts and each person in the room gets to assign a new rule that relates to that scene. E.g. a scene with Harvey and Jessica Pearson: - Drink every time someone makes a sexual innuendo  - Drink whenever someone says 'God damn it'  - Drink whenever Jessica raises an eye brow  Obviously for each scene there's a new set of rules. This ensures that people are actually drinking!  Enjoy

It wasn't intended to just be 2 lawyers trying to win cases every week. There are more layers to this show than that, which is the reason it became popular, since it's not just 1 suit an episode. There are a ton of shows on TV that have that format already, and if that's what you want to see you can literally find them on almost all major networks."

suits,2uysra,pridejoker,15,Fri Feb 6 08:03:37 2015 UTC,What bugged me about that scene with Louis is that you can't actaully believe Louis has gone his whole career without ever having to take a client to dinner. The fact that he didn't understand that was unrealistic and out of character of him.
suits,2uysra,RyVsWorld,7,Fri Feb 6 11:16:13 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how many clients louis himself has brought in. He's always been tge followup guy doing the billed work.
suits,2uysra,RyVsWorld,2,Fri Feb 6 11:54:06 2015 UTC,Doesnt matter. Its not like Louis wasnt a partner before he became named partner. Its highly unreasonable to expect someone whose probably been in law to have gone 20+ years without understanding the importance of forming a personal relationship with your client. Thats basic business knowledge  Louis is an asshole sure...but trying to make his character that clueless is lazy.
suits,2uysra,rickrocketed,2,Fri Feb 6 11:58:15 2015 UTC,but also even if he manages the associates and what not he is a senior partner meaning he would have to had brought in clients himself otherwise anyone else can really do his job
suits,2uysra,tik22,3,Fri Feb 6 20:14:07 2015 UTC,I think Louis was a junior at that point right? Then he made senior partner some time in season two because of Daniel Hardman.
suits,2uysra,bane_killgrind,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:45:43 2015 UTC,i dont know why your being downvoted. To be a partner you have to bring in clients simple as that. Id even argue whatever level comes before partner will probably require you to bring in clients. When your associate you are expected to do good work but as you move through the ranks they expect more from you like client interaction.
suits,2uysra,shinigami052,3,Sat Feb 7 15:05:43 2015 UTC,"Well, the clients that Louis would interface best with are the go getters, down to brass tacks, get it done sort of guys.  He may have never had a non-business dinner with a client, or at least not one recently. The clients that postpone the business as long as possible would be doing so as a power play over Louis, for whatever ego reasons, and it makes sense that Louis would be uncomfortable and impatient if he thought she was doing that."
suits,2uysra,julianqt,5,Fri Feb 6 17:58:10 2015 UTC,That or he's so eager and blind to prove himself to everyone that he forgot how to play the game.  It's pretty much what Rachel and Donna said to him.

suits,2uxxpc,RyVsWorld,-9,Sun Feb 8 03:32:13 2015 UTC,"Not going to lie in my opinion this has been one of the worst episodes of the series along with all the Rachel focused episodes but maybe its because I was just annoyed at the cheesy CGI in the beginning.   Ill try to explain why without sounding like an ass.  -The way Jessie and Harvey interact and speak with eachother sounds so unrealistic. It just sounds so forced.  -Whenever Louis backs Harvey into a corner, Harvey just threatens to kick his ass  -The way Mike tried to convince Harvey to take on the case with the conversation in the bathroom was cringe worthy  -The dynamic is pretty much back to normal with the exception of Louis being name partner  -The so obviously fake NYC setting is starting to really stick out to me  -the banter between Mike and Harvey also seems really forced. Its like they never have a regular conversation. I mean at this point in the series arent they basically best friends?  -After reading through my points maybe I just think Harvey is really cheesy now. So is Mike but hes always been like that.  With that being said I agree that it was one of the better episodes of the season but thats not saying much. I will continue to watch because I am a sucker for watching good television shows drive themselves into the ground.   and uhhh Donna is hot."

suits,2uujgm,siziono,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, there was one scene in particular in the s2 premiere where Peter and Elizabeth were at a cafe, some of the worst green screen I've seen in a TV show"

(When it's not an ice rink)  It was like they messed up the scaling on her and had slightly squished her left to right."

suits,2uwvx1,GoddamnLawyer,8,Thu Feb 5 21:27:18 2015 UTC,"The professor's name is Gerard, not Gerald - there was a businessman called Gerald in a previous season.  I agree that Gerard needed the money for something important because as you said he was willing to cross his entire morals. However, normally people cross these circumstances for others rather than them self.   Look at the evidence:   He's needed the money for a while now - Harvey mentions he was gambling for at least a year because that's when he approached him about Mike He himself looked fairly well, if he had cancer or a terminal diagnosis he would normally be showing some signs of the condition/ treatment taking effect. He didn't really want to give the 25k back at the end  Harvey paid the 25k so it implies Harvey agreed with whatever the circumstance was - he gave a head nod acknowledging his sympathy.   I think he has a daughter/ grand-daughter who has a serious condition and the money is/was for funding their ongoing treatment. I also don't think Gerard was the one who approached Ian, instead Ian probably found out Gerard was in trouble and exploited an opportunity - at the end when Harvey said he'd pay the 25k, he knew why Gerard wanted it. Seems to make sense others could find it out too.  I'm sure we'll find out more in future episodes."
