flyfishing,3e3wci,harlji,4,Tue Jul 21 19:31:00 2015 UTC,I honestly feel that the first fish is a golden.
flyfishing,3e3wci,steelheadbum,2,Tue Jul 21 21:18:23 2015 UTC,The first fish looks like a golden to me. Cutthroats don't have the bright red belly or the bright red spot on the cheek. Golden trout lose their par marks when they get over 12 inches or so. The easiest way to tell for next time would be to look for the orange cutthroat markings on the chin.
flyfishing,3e3wci,L_cole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:56:52 2015 UTC,"So I went fishing this weekend to a lake in Colorado with known Golden Trout and Cutts in it.  The first fish in the picture is the one in question.  At first I thought I just caught a bunch of Cuttthroat, but now looking back and googling images of Goldens, I believe the Goldens are in larger numbers than I thought and bigger than I expected them to be.  What do you guys think?"

flyfishing,3e3wci,DukeGordon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:34 2015 UTC,"this fish totally has parr marks! i think your trout in question is a golden due to white leading edge on the fins, like you said Wyoming Golden Trout ID"
flyfishing,3e3wci,whiteboyday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:44 2015 UTC,"If I were to lean one way or another I would say golden trout, but there is a possibility that it is a cutthroat-golden hybrid if they inhabit the same water. The white leading edge of the fins and pink along the entire bottoms leads me to believe it is at least part golden."

This is a first but hoping to do more like this with a fly and the arthropod it mimics. I'm very new to this area, I had a lot of trouble finding the right mayfly, I still don't think it was completely correct. A western brown march fly in its subimago stage was my last guess and went with it. Hope you all like it! This was a gift to my Dad for fathers day.  Also was hoping to ask if there are any links to sites with the fishing flies and the insect or crustacean its representing? Thanks for any info."

flyfishing,3e31en,raft_man,3,Tue Jul 21 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"This is such an easy thing to do and does not need to be overthought. Fluorocarbon sinks while monofilament floats, so pick one depending on the fly presentation desired. Start with thicker line for the butt section and taper to desired lb test.   For trout I go 30lb-20lb-10lb-6lb.   For pike and musky I go 2' of 50lb Flouro to 8"" of wire.   Bass: 30lb-20lb-10lb.   Steelhead: straight 6lb.   Double uni, triple surgeon's, nail, blood. Pick a knot...doesn't matter. Double Uni is my go-to for line to line.   Good luck and keep it simple."
flyfishing,3e31en,S0urDiesel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:55 2015 UTC,You only use 6lb for steelhead?
flyfishing,3e31en,Squid_Viciously,3,Wed Jul 22 00:55:05 2015 UTC,"I typically use Stren for my butt sections and Maxima Chameleon for the end of the leader. Keep it cheap, especially if you're just tying general purpose leaders. Also, tippet rings are awesome for the end of your leader. In my experience, I have rarely broken a leader above it, plus you can make more generic leaders (i.e., butt section plus some to tippet ring allows me to change from nymphs/dries to ripping streamers).  Ok, now for my recipe, this is kinda rough, but I have found to like it for a jack-of-all-trades leader.  9' Leader:  2'    - #40 Stren  1.5' - #30 Stren  1'    - #25 Stren  1'    - #20 Maxima  1'    - #15 Maxima  1'    - #12 Maxima  .5'   - #10 Maxima  .5'   - #8 Maxima  .5'   - #6 Maxima  Tippet Ring  For a 7.5' leader, I'd probably nix the #40 and lengthen the #30.  As I typed this out, I realize this is kind of a lot. Practice your blood knot. Once you tie a few, you'll get the hang of it and start cranking them out. I pretrim all my sections and build 3-5 leaders at a time.  This is what has worked for me. Off of the tippet ring, I'll tie 18"" of 5x for most applications. If I have to go smaller, I'll drop the 5x length and add accordingly.  For my streamer leaders, I'll usually go down to the #15 section, add a tippet ring, and add 3x accordingly.  For me, leader tying was kind of daunting at first, but what you'll ultimately learn is that you have to tie and test. It depends on what type of fishing you do, your casting style, and a plethora of other factors. I'd recommend getting 30' of cheap Stren/Maxima/etc in several different tests and just see what works.  Not turning over? Add more butt section. Losing energy in the fly at the end of your cast? This generally dealt with my taper being to drastic.  The best benefit of tying leaders has been building leaders that work for me. Also, not having to buy tapered leaders and doing the untangle dance that occasionally ends in throwing away $5."
flyfishing,3e31en,austburn,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:08 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Googling 'George Harvey slack line leaders'. Lots of formulas out there, I'm a big proponent of hand tied leaders, especially for dry fly fishing."
flyfishing,3e31en,tomchou,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:36 2015 UTC,"tip : coat your knots with UV knot sense or wader repair, really helps preventing tangles when bad casting / wind gusts makes your leader rub on itself while straightening."

flyfishing,3e31en,_iFish,2,Tue Jul 21 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"Something LIKE that is really great, and is what I started out with. This one I have problems with.   The first problem is that, while Chameleon is one of my favorite leader materials, it's colored and shouldn't really be used towards the front end of a leader. Maxima Ultragreen is a good alternative, but still has some color.   The second grip is the pound range. You will never need one pound line for tying leaders, but you'll want bigger than 25.   This or this would be my recommendation.  Edit, this will really help you get a good tapered section down. I'd highly recommend playing around the butt end material (such as stren or chameleon). Also, do yourself a favor and pick up some tippet rings. They are life savers.  Edit 2, forget what anybody says about tying flies, you only truly master fly fishing when you can tie a good leader.

flyfishing,3e31en,_iFish,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:58:10 2015 UTC,"You're going to be putting in a lot of work tying up a fancy pancy leader. You won't want to continually cut back on it by tying tippet on. Rings definitely aren't better for turnover, but they'll save a leader for months."

I come at this from the perspective of a backpacker, not an angler, but let me make some suggestions that may or may not be tenable.   I'd only take one pair of footwear.  Pick Keens or boots. Is the net really necessary? Are 2 reels (pun intended) really necessary? I have no idea what that thingamajig is below the fly boxes. Why does it look like you're taking 2 rods? Not sure what's in the black, green, and other black (REI) bags or the green rolled up thing... Leave the plate at home.  Eat out of the pot. Dump the camp chair.   I know these may seem like basic comforts, but they won't provide all that much comfort if you have to lug them around all day.  Of course, this depends on the mileage and goals of your trip."
flyfishing,3dxt62,elduderino260,9,Mon Jul 20 14:39:46 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing about the net and two reels, but as someone who has broken more than one rod on a day hike, I'd hate to be stuck with one several days into a backcountry trip and end up that guy with the homemade bamboo jawn we saw a few weeks ago."
flyfishing,3dxt62,wheelfoot,3,Mon Jul 20 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"Sweet, thanks for the input!!!  We'll be fishing a small creek and hiking to 3 lakes. So the keens are for wet wading, but could probably do without just makes things a bit easier. The two reels/two rods, ones a 3 wt. the other is 6 wt., again one for the creek and one for the lakes. Could probably do without two, but like wheelfoot says, if one breaks for whatever reason I'd hate to not have a backup.  Below the fly boxes is my lanyard with what I need for the fishing.  The green rolled up thing is my sleeping pad. The one rei stuff sack is my down bag and small pillow. Then the really small rei bag is a small first aid kit.  The net also probably isn't necessary, been debating on that as well.  The camp chair....the older I get the nicer it is to have haha.   The pack I'm taking weighs in at a little over 2 lbs.  EDIT: Mileage wise it's 12 miles one way with 4000 feet of elevation gain. So the hike in is going to be a bit tougher than the hike out. Staying a couple days up at 12,300 feet to fish the lakes, and a couple of days down in the valley fishing the creek."
flyfishing,3dxt62,elduderino260,3,Mon Jul 20 15:26:30 2015 UTC,"Cool.  I would say ditch the keens.  Bare feet can handle a lot.  Not ideal, but I know that Keens are heavy footwear.    I hear what you're saying about the reels/rods.  I don't know how much they weigh, so it's a cost-benefit analysis you'll have to do.  Would it be possible to put both rods into one case?    Obviously the pad, bag, and FA kit are essentials.  I would ditch the pillow and just use a stuff sack stuffed with clothes.  Not much weight/volume saving, but these things add up.    It'll be a tough hike in with the food, but the trip sounds awesome!"
flyfishing,3dxt62,Quick_Chowder,2,Mon Jul 20 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"The Keens are the lightweight ones, coming in at around pound, I keep saying oh this is not that much and that isn't that much, but it all adds up! haha.

flyfishing,3dxt62,HonProfDrEsqCPA,4,Mon Jul 20 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"I'm in favor of bringing the Keens. Bare feet can handle a lot, but slippery or sharp rocks could end your trip. Whenever I backpack I bring my Simms Wading sandals and my hiking boots. The boots handle the trail way better, and the sandals handle the water way better. If you're carrying it then I don't see the problem."

flyfishing,3dxt62,herpslurp,2,Mon Jul 20 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"No.  When I fish in the hills, I am fishing in the Eastern Smoky Mountain range and I carry a G23 pistol which weighs approximately 2 lbs loaded; in my holster I carry a second clip ""just in case"".  I realize that the impact of a round will not necessary drop a bear like that of a .357 or some other cannon but it is durable, reliable, light weight and I can fire 13 rounds very fast so I have confidence with it at my side.   I have been fishing these hills for years and have only had to withdraw it from the holster one time and did not have to fire a shot."

Even if you manage to put 5 out of 13 rounds in whatever is charging you, its better to have that round mushroom and do as much internal damage as possible rather than pass through the target.

This way you can switch between saltwater and freshwater (just make sure you clean the reel after you use it in saltwater).   As for the rod, Im in the market to buy one myself. Right now my options are the 10 ft Orvis Clearwater, a 10 ft Echo Boost, a 10 ft Echo Ion, or an 10 ft Orvis Recon. I'm probably only going to use my 8 wt 1-2 times per year so I kind of want to pick one of the cheaper options. Have you considered Echo?   If I were you I would get the rod with the Greys reel.

flyfishing,3e152q,OldOlleboMP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:52:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with that particular reel, but the main issue you may have is the smaller reel not having enough capacity for a full spool of 7wt line and backing.  Its not ideal, but you could probably make it work by either using less backing, or less floating line.  I'm making the assumption that the drag on the reel is sufficient for whatever you plan to catch on a 7wt."
flyfishing,3e152q,coopedw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:12:32 2015 UTC,I'm looking at using it for bass. I figured capacity was the problem but do you see any issue with having a little less backing for bass fishing? It could also be used for trout fishing on bigger western rivers occasionally.
flyfishing,3e152q,coopedw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:15:50 2015 UTC,You should be fine.  Bass probably aren't gonna make super longs runs and clean the reel up.  I'd go with a little less backing and tighten the drag up if you get into a fish that has you down to the backing. Good Luck!

flyfishing,3dz9dp,JPFLYSURF,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to go into a fly shop with an accommodating staff to get  you going with a two handed setup. The line choices can be a bit overwhelming but they should be able to get you started so you can worry less about equipment and leaders and focus on getting a good swing and cast in. You should probably get out on your local water ASAP and start casting, I took lessons when I first got a two hander and it sped up the learning curve a lot."

flyfishing,3dz9dp,Squid_Viciously,2,Wed Jul 22 00:24:43 2015 UTC,"You can learn to cast on still water... learning how the anchor works is the most important thing, and then which casts to use depending on river direction and wind direction. Dec Hogan's book covers most of the casts, so you can get the principles down.  Also, you might want to look into Scandi lines for the Deschutes in October. Skagit heads are easier to learn, but really clunky in comparison and are really best used for tossing heavier sinktips for winter flows. Scandi lines allow for more touch-and-go style casts, less stripping and your fly will spend more time in the water, swinging."

My advice would be to fish as much as possible while in school. Work a restaurant job to save up some cash. Spend that cash on a boat so you can start getting some on the water experience. Then start taking your friends out as much as possible.  Another way to get guiding experience would be to look for summer jobs up in Alaska. You would probably not start as a guide, but working up that ladder is pretty fun. And hey, you get to fish Alaska.   Not a guide myself but I have a few friends who are although I have worked in AK at a lodge. Seems like a fun life if you can make it work. Expect lots of fish and fun, just not a ton of money (but hey that's not what it's about)."

We took a break as they pulsed the river and during this time, it clouded up and started a light drizzle.  As the water subsided and we moved back into the river, there was the most epic hatch of BWO's I have ever seen and it went on for hours on end and the fish were going nuts over them; we were catching good numbers of fish on size 22 & 20 thread bodied BWO dry's.   After the second hour of this hatch, the Sulphur's started coming off as well and the fish were now eating both.  We tied on size 16 Sulphurs and tailed it with a BWO, 12"" behind the Sulphur.  Even though they were eating both off the surface, we had better luck with the BWO as they were refusing our Sulphurs way more than they were eating them.  Being low and slow water, you would see these fish come right up to the Sulphur, examine it for a few seconds and then turn away.   Was an exciting day to say the least.  I am sure you had a similar day as mine, glad you were able to experience a great hatch on the SoHO."

flyfishing,3dwtjc,Midnightlama,0,Tue Jul 21 02:06:31 2015 UTC,"If I were you, instead of buying multiple rods in multiple weights for around $100, I would buy one or two nice ones. I only fish for bass and trout, so I have a nice 4wt and 6wt setup. There is nothing wrong with having multiple weights of rods Id you are serious about the sport, but $100 isn't going to get you much. That being said, a redington crosswater comes to mind when looking for a cheaper rod"

flyfishing,3du4lr,pixelpickle,2,Sun Jul 19 14:20:02 2015 UTC,"If you hit the lower Colorado from little webberville to big webberville there's a lot of guad bass in there... they fight like hell for the size!   I was fishing barton creek from the hill of life yesterday! mainly was catching pan fish... but managed a decent LM by some submerged trees... also, I was just using an ulralight spinning reel... so there's that..."
flyfishing,3dwzra,OldOlleboMP,2,Mon Jul 20 05:57:06 2015 UTC,"So there are stocked trout in a few places in the winter in the hill country - the Guadalupe is the most famous, and crowded, but the state puts them in a few places scattered around - your 9' 4 wt will be just fine for them.  When the weather warms up, you'll want to go after bass, panfish and maybe carp and gar, depending on your disposition - There are lots and lots of places in and around Austin to fish for them. If you're stripping streamers or big poppers for bass, you might want to up your rod size, but if for panfish and other small creek things, the 4 weight will be fine. I fish for panfish and small bass in barton creek with a 3 weight, and have never had a problem, but I'm using small foam terrestrials, not big conehead streamers. I personally rarely use anything over a 4 weight, but there are folks who fish for big bass and carp with nothing smaller than a 6.   You don't need to give up fly fishing at all, you just need to change your expectation around the type of fish you're willing to catch. I've found that I can fish for small stream bluegill, yellow bellied sunfish and bass in much the same way that I fish for small stream trout, with a dry/dropper, or even a pair of nymphs with an indicator. Shoot when the water was up this spring, i was even using some czech nymphing to get fish.  I've had many stretches of a couple of hours where i catch 50+ fish, have had doubles on a dry/dropper and generally have had as good a time as when in the mountains. Just gotta think of the green sunfish as ""texas brook trout"". Pretty much every time i go to the creek i think to myself ""Man, if this water were 10degrees cooler in the summer, this would be the most amazing trout stream"", but then i realize that if that were the fact it would be packed to the gills every single day, and I'd be miserable dealing with the crowds...  There are a few fly shops right around Austin - sportsman's finest in bee caves, living waters in round rock, and a couple about an hour south in New Braunfels near the Guadalupe. There's a book ""Fly Fishing the Texas Hill Country"" by Kevin Hutchison one of the local guides here - it's available in most of the fly shops and gives a good list of access points to public waters and an idea of what kind of tackle you want to use.  Hit me up with a DM - I'm out of town for the next month, and there's really not a lot of fishing until everything cools down for the fall, but once that happens, i'll be outside for sure."
flyfishing,3dwzra,benalt,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"This sums it up pretty well. The good thing about Austin is that you can fish downtown or you can drive about an hour to any of the state parks in the area. I use my 3 wt all the time for small bass and panfish on Bull Creek and Lost Creek.  EDIT: I would check out die Fische for info on what to use, where to go, and when to go."

For trout, the only real option is either the Guadalupe or a road trip up to Broken Bow, OK to fish the Lower Mountain Fork.  I really enjoy bass and bream fishing from either small ponds around here, to some of the rivers in hill country.  Your also close enough for a weekend trip to Port O'Connor and some great shallow water Redfish, if you're interested in saltwater."

Try throwing sand flea type flies, crabs or clousers int he surf. Never know what you might find. Look for areas where the water is flowing out from the beach. Usually these are small channels and bait is being pulled out and there are fish there waiting for the food to come to them. Fishing between a sandbar and the beach can be good too.   I have read there are a few creeks in myrtle you can wade, and catch reds or trout.   Murrells Inlet is a pretty good fishery I have read, but I dont know much about it."

flyfishing,3dsril,Midnightlama,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:28:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely a good starter rod! Besides which, the price was right! I personally think you should just run that rod and see how you like it for a bit.   Half the battle at this point is going to be casting for you. I've been fly fishing for years and I still don't have it perfected. Remain patient with yourself! You're gonna snag things that you didn't want to in your back cast, you're gonna whip the water and generally feel like a mess. Keep with it! Nothing compares to fighting a trout...or any fish for that matter with a fly rod.   One more quick point, not sure how popular this is going to be, but some fly lines have loops attached to them for quick leader attachment (you have to buy leaders with loops on them, then you loop the leader around itself and you're ready to go). Nail knots are hard and confusing and I taught myself to do them, but the looped leaders are MUCH easier to deal with and get you fishing faster.   Best of luck and welcome to the addiction!"
flyfishing,3dsril,SonofGizmoduck,3,Sun Jul 19 04:38:56 2015 UTC,If im changing leaders i like a nail knot to a few inch section of 25lbs+ leader with a perfection loop on the end of that. Much better energy transfer and you only ever need to do the nail knot once.
flyfishing,3dsril,_iFish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:46:21 2015 UTC,"I use a three weight for small dry flies. I use a four weight much of the time. I prefer my five weight if I am throwing big Cicadas or large foam hoppers and it is windy. I use a seven weight for big articulated streamers.   You can see, I select the rod for trout fishing based on the size and weight of the fly, not the fish size. I have landed 22"" trout on the three weight using a size 20 PMD dry fly without difficulty."

flyfishing,3dmv7a,YouMonkeysYou,2,Fri Jul 17 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"They jump a lot and are very acrobatic. When the big ones jump, you have to lean forward and point the rod tip toward them so they won't land on the line and break it"
flyfishing,3dmv7a,HonProfDrEsqCPA,2,Fri Jul 17 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"Tons. I typically don't land them because of that. It seems about 9 times out of 10 they will spit the hook while they're in the air. This one jumped 5 separate times, I was lucky he was hooked very well. Half the fun though is getting them to jump, to the point that a successful trip really isn't all about how many you catch it's about how many you jump lol."

flyfishing,3dmfwi,MaverickFly,2,Fri Jul 17 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"Truly an inspiration!  When I started fly fishing I read all the magazines I could get my hands on. I clearly remember one article in particular standing out. It was about a guy who scoured the internet for signs of an area that might be promising, looking for an impossible fish. One that was native to an area but had been extirpated. A fish that nobody knew if it was still there, but there were rumors. That guy decided to go give it a shot based off of physical data and word of mouth, and it paid off huge.   That article really inspired a lot of my fly fishing. I'm currently in works to do something similar myself, break a state record trout in my current state by hiking in to a remote area.   Anywho, turns out you were that guy. I res tagged you as ""Golden Trout"" when you made some of your first posts here.   Thanks for being a personal inspiration, and thanks for being an active member here.

Washington and the Seattle area in general is one of the most asked about areas on here.  It's been talked about a lot, and the search feature will pull up a whole lot of info for you.  In short:  This area has a huge learning curve.  It's not easy to get settled in here, but it's very rewarding when you figure it out.  Unfortunately, this year, things are bad.  Streams are low and warm due to the drought, and most all streams are running too warm and low to fish.

You could just about cast across it in some places. The best place to catch them would be where you would expect any fish: in deep pools, along deep runs, behind large rocks. Not in any swift or rapid water. These little guys were not picky at all so we threw out large dry flies (mostly caddis) and caught lots of them over two days. Very fun! It reminds me of catching small rainbows or brookies on small rivers back home in Montana - if you have any experience with something like that."

The river went from 35 cubic meters per second to 90 cubic meters per second and almost unfishable.

The weather and condition were terrible, one morning we only stayed out for about an hour and we were always back at the lodge really early for lunch and dinner. While parts of the USA are having trouble with droughts we are having the opposite problem, just too much and too cold water! Most of the pools were unfishable and it was really hard finding any fish.  That being said, this river is more about quality over quantity. Big salmon in spectacular landscape far away from everything. If you want many fish, you go to west Iceland, but that will probably cost a lot more and the fish are smaller."

flyfishing,3djvrr,dullyouth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:15 2015 UTC,"Yea so you won't be able to cast for one. Second is an 8wt is way too much rod for mountain stream trout. The rod won't bend in able to cast the line, and it also won't bend for the fish so you'll lose any fish you can manage to hook.   Get an 8wt line to cast an 8wt rod, but I still wouldn't recommend fishing an 8wt rod for stream trout."

Mostly mountain streams in south central Pennsylvania for stocked trout. But we also did some of the limestone streams in the area. These are super clear with wary fish. Nearly impossible to catch. I  spent the summer of '03 working in a print factory and had a lot of weekdays off. I was on Big Springs every day I wasn't working trying to figure that creek out. Hours upon hours on a 1/4 mile stretch. I got one bite, one damn bite and it was fantastic to know I even came close. But the big thing was just being out there. I'd sit along the bank watching those fish and it was probably the most peaceful I've felt in my life. I've moved out of state since then but some day I'll go back. Maybe I'll catch something, probably not. I know I'll love every minute of it. Good luck with that rainbow."

flyfishing,3dfccm,vebben,11,Wed Jul 15 20:49:01 2015 UTC,"Hooooly cow you guys need to understand how that even happens. When it breaks at the ferrule (especially the bottom ferrule), 99% of the time its because the ferrule wasn't seated correctly and had worked itself loose from casting. Happens ALL. THE. TIME.   Buy some ferrule wax and think twice before blaming a company's shoddy worksmanship for something that, in most cases, is the customers fault.   But yea, Orvis has a no fault warranty. You can find it here"
flyfishing,3dfccm,_iFish,2,Wed Jul 15 21:47:30 2015 UTC,"yep it happens. even with ferrule wax sometimes the piece will ride up and break. another option is that your bro could have nailed the ferrule with his fly/splitty/hook hard enough to make a small crack. once the crack is there, its pretty much a ticking timebomb for breaking. other ways ive broken a rod: dog chewed, dog stepped, wrapped line around dog while she was running full speed, ran over rod with car, slammed in car door by wind, stepped on it while releasing fish, and about 3 times where i have no clue what happened.   this will not be OPs last broken rod. get used to sending them in, it sucks but at least they'll replace it."

Lifting the line out of the water to cast- SNAP! That's the 4th one he's busted. I was right there, casting my Redington 7wt Switch (which is awesome) We are both guides, so we get great deals on new rods and the like. But I'll be the first to tell you, he hates Orvis over that. He keeps having to send them in, they replace, won't even refund him after the 3rd time. The rod is close to $900 retail- (again we get pro deal prices, which would lead one to think they would refund) I'd recommend Redington Prospector 7wt Switch- fished it all weekend landed 4 good 30""+ steelies with it."
flyfishing,3dfccm,ihate2cuddle,4,Wed Jul 15 21:15:12 2015 UTC,If you're serious about this I would call the rod shop in Vermont and ask to speak to someone you can discuss this with in detail. Rods don't break when they're being cast unless there's a previous fracture or a heavy fly is being thrown and nicks the rod. Especially if you're guides and receive pro deals you should communicate what you're seeing in the field to how the equipment is performing.
flyfishing,3dfccm,HyperionTX,2,Wed Jul 15 23:01:14 2015 UTC,"This is copy/pasta from 4 months ago from a pro-dealed fishing guide who comments more on r/personalfinance. He's only posted to this sub twice, both times being this."
flyfishing,3dfccm,_iFish,0,Thu Jul 16 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"/u/iFish, totally correct, just didn't have time to retype out a different reply, my apologies, truly.  /u/HyperionTX- it has been communicated to them, even sent emails to product development, R&D ect. They did have an entire shipment prove to be faulty- issuing a recall: http://www.orvis.com/s/the-orvis-recall-center-notices-of-recalls-for-orvis-products/3910  To date I've seen 6 Helios rods break- from 4 different guides. (all switch, 7wts)  I agree that a heavy fly can cause this- and fly line. I'm just saying I've witnessed it, then witnessed the same set up- on a Sage rod (same wt) and no issues. That's all I'm stating, I have Orvis equipment, no rods currently as I can't trust them after what I've seen. They do make sure to replace or repair the rods- I'll give them that. But if you're out in the wilderness for 6 days on a trip, a great warranty doesn't do you any help.     Honestly the issue with Orvis is they are huge, you can only talk to a general email box, the calls are fielded through a call center. I'm not talking trash in that regard, just what you get with a huge company like that. Reddington used to be amazing pre Sage, they are still pretty good- just amazing when they were little."

flyfishing,3dg5iv,_iFish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:56:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. A buddy of mine has the ct and really likes it. I was only asking because cabelas has both of them on sale for 100 from 150
flyfishing,3dg5iv,daniellinphoto,2,Thu Jul 16 02:10:21 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound like a recommendation for the 4wt CT, but for your purposes, I might think twice about it.  I have the 9' 4wt CT. Honestly it's pretty damn slow for modern graphite, which is exactly the selling point. It's my dry fly/nymph and general go-to stream trout rod if larger/weighted streamers aren't in the equation for the day. And if they are, I'll strap a 6wt rod to my pack.  I can authoritatively say that the advantages of the true moderate action in the CT are tippet protection (you just have to not be afraid to let the rod bennnnnndddddddd) and the slower action naturally allows for a gentler presentation.  The disadvantages include loss of ability to throw larger/weighted streamers (you can, but it's not pretty), and if you find yourself on bigger water, you might suffer some loss in casting distance. Doubly so, obviously, if you find yourself trying to cast larger flies on bigger water.  Overall, no regrets and it sees a ton of use during trout season, but the major caveat is that I have a rather complete quiver of rods to cover pretty much anything that comes my way short of musky.   I also noticed that Cabelas isn't offering 4wt TFO Pro Specials, only in 5wt. Here, without knowing what's currently in your quiver, you might have to make the choice between a do-it-all moderate fast 5wt or shelling out for two, more specialized rods, such as a slower 4wt and a faster 6wt.   On that note, maybe it's time to break away from owning only even weight rods and give a 5wt a fair shake. Sometimes, bringing two rods out to play can be a fairly major hassle, especially trying to pack up and put together rods standing waist deep in a river."

Come check us out /r/arkieoutdoors too  Tailwaters at beaver dam is some of the best trout fishing around. They've had the floodgates open so it hasn't been great fishing lately but it's usually pretty good. I'm a bass fisher so I can't offer any trout tips. Sorry about that. I don't know of many guides on that part of the white but call up the Dam Store and ask them. They have a lot of trout fisherman that hang out there.   There's a lot of guides over on the white river below bull shoals, too. It's not terribly far away but it's a little bit of a drive."

flyfishing,3da4hg,Kiernanstrat,2,Tue Jul 14 19:30:25 2015 UTC,If you rub the slime off of a fish it becomes very susceptible to infection. That's why you should always handle fish with wet hands and use a knot-less net. Also a fish on the ground can have its slime rubbed off. Since it looks like that guy is in some wet leafy vegetation and moss he's probably fine but the best way to release a fish is to never take it out of the water.

Notice how it doesn't have the big black dots that go in a line down the abdomen over the red like the California Golden. Have caught thousands of California Golden Trout, hundreds of stocked Rainbow trout out of the Kern River that are more silver, but never a Native Kern River Rainbow. The Kern River Rainbow has the white tipped fins similar to the California Golden and a more golden than silver belly as apposed to other Rainbow species that are more silver. In fact, according to this website: http://www.ecoangler.com/species/golden.html the Kern River Rainbow is actually a subspecies of the Golden Trout, not Rainbow, unless the website is just explaining what trout can be found in the Golden Trout Wilderness of the Southern Sierras, but either way, awesome catch! So jealous!"
flyfishing,3d7yvj,dmf63,2,Tue Jul 14 16:02:09 2015 UTC,"Golden trout lose their par marks when they get big. All the small fish in this lake still have them.

flyfishing,3d7yvj,dmf63,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yea idk. Probably just depends on the species of Golden then because over the years, of the (seriously) thousands of of Goldens I have caught in the High Sierras, a quite a few of them, but not many, have been in the 12"" plus range and they still all had there par marks. Probably similar to some species of brown trout lose them when they get bigger while some keep them. There are a lot more species of rainbow, brown, golden trout out there then most people realize so I guess I'd just never seen one like this. Awesome fish either way."

flyfishing,3darvh,kurt-wagner,2,Tue Jul 14 20:47:08 2015 UTC,"Okay well I see the path comes in a 4 piece and a 2 piece config. Always get 4 piece rods whenever available.  Rod: Honestly they're probably made in the same overseas factory, or at least in 2 very similar factories with similar components. The Orvis looks like it has a double ring reel seat lock which is nice, whereas the path has 1. Sometimes single rings can come lose and you'll drop your reel so you'll want to pay attention to that. I haven't casted either so I can't say much about them.   Reel: Both are comparable. Simple, plastic, large arbor. You're not getting a better deal one way or another there. The Clearwater is metal and therefore is better.  Line: Hard to say but again likely very comparable.   Rod Case: The Redington rod case has a space for the reel whereas the Orvis you have to take the reel off. I've always preferred the cases with space for the reel. Similar quality on both, but one way is a little easier.   Warranties: Both are fantastic. The Orvis you can take back in to a physical store if something bad happens, the Redington you'll have to ship. Orvis is no questions asked, Redington is defect only (but I've never heard of them turning someone down outside of it being stolen). Redington's warranty only covers the rod and not the reel. Orvis covers the whole thing. Orvis charges a $30 handling fee whereas I believe the Redington is slightly more expensive.   My vote: $130 covers the cost of a new (even better) reel with some to spare for a warranty replacement."

flyfishing,3darvh,zrockstar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"I would disagree. I own both as well -- 8.5ft Clearwater combo and 9ft Path both in 5wt. I can tell the quality of the Orvis rod is better, but it doesn't fish twice as good as the Path which is half the cost. The only thing I didn't care for much on the Path was the line, but it is definitely fishable for at least a year. Don't get me wrong, Orvis is my go to brand, but I would not say the Crosswater is a long shot better than the Path -- especially with the Redington having a lifetime warranty."

flyfishing,3darvh,RoverLife,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"For me it really comes down to the warranty. The Orvis warranty is worth $200 without the rod, it has saved me numerous times."
flyfishing,3darvh,zrockstar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:37:51 2015 UTC,"Right, but the anything above the Redington Crosswater will have a lifetime warranty. Orvis is great because you can walk into most stores and they will take care of it for you, whereas Redington you have to mail in and include $30, but it is still a lifetime unconditional warranty, and I would say to get a Path combo for $140, that is the better bet for a newcomer."
flyfishing,3darvh,RoverLife,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:08:01 2015 UTC,"True, but the warranty on the Redington doesn't cover accidentally breaking it, or at least it is implied that it does not. That would be my only issue"
flyfishing,3darvh,pwned555,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:14:08 2015 UTC,"Since I haven't used either I can't really tell you if one is much better than the other.  I do have a Redington Classic Trout and Redington Predator that I love, but Orvis is a great brand too.  I think you'll be happy with either combo, if you are just starting out it might be a good idea to get the Path and save the extra money for later.  Even if you get more serious and decide you want a nicer rod/reel it will always be a good backup rod for you.  That's just me though, I'm pretty cheap especially when I'm starting a new sport and I'm not sure how into it I'll be getting.  I think my first combo was a scientific anger combo that was really cheap and it caught me just as many fish for the 5 or so years it lasted until I finally upgraded."
flyfishing,3darvh,Gravaman007,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:50:22 2015 UTC,"I have the 8.5' 5 wt Orvis Clearwater rod but use the Mid Arbor Reel. I enjoy the Clearwater Rod very much.

flyfishing,3darvh,SpeedyLights,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:06:03 2015 UTC,"I have the Clearwater with the standard outfit large arbor reel. Mine is 9' but I have also fished the 8.5'. My experience with the rod/reel over the past couple years has been very good. I broke the tip section last summer, and took it into a store. They ship it to Orvis HQ, and then it gets shipped back to you. The process took a couple weeks if I remember. Orvis has also fixed my reel free of charge on one occasion. I'd say I've gotten more than my moneys worth for a great rod and reel."
flyfishing,3darvh,neekoriss,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"i've taken the Orvis path. there are a few benefits to this - for one, the better rods will give you a few extra feet on your cast. also, orvis has a lifetime guarantee to fix your rod for any reason. you could run over with a car on purpose and as long as you still have the butt section to send back they will repair or replace it for almost free ($30 charge to cover shipping to and from the factory). they also have a pretty good trade up program. i started with the clearwater that i bought used from a friend. i sent it in for a repair and while on the phone with them found out i could trade up to the next level Access rod for the cost difference which was around $75 at the time. so even though it was a used, broken, 3 year old rod, they still gave me full credit to put towards the purchase of a trade up rod. and that's not some deal i convinced them to give me. that's standard procedure. on top of that they're a great company that provides tons of resources and training videos on their site as well as physical store locations all over the US. i just like them as a company, they treat their customers right, and i feel like their rods are superior to the cheaper ones. i'd rather pay a little more for a better rod from a company like that"

flyfishing,3d9ojb,pwned555,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:58:14 2015 UTC,"I agree completely with going with the a name brand combo.  You could step up a little and get this one if you wanted.  But in all honesty if no one is an avid fly fisher I would think getting two of the combo listed by dahuii22 would be much better that way more people can be fishing at the same time and the difference will probably be negligible.  Also if you do end up getting something and it comes in a 2 or 4 piece make sure you spend the few extra dollars for a 4 piece.  It makes carrying, packing, flying, basically everything you might someday do with that rod 100x easier."

There's all sorts of fish there from rainbows, brookies, loopers, king salmon, coho salmon, pink salmon, splake, steelhead, with some sucker fish thrown in for good measure. Check the regs on the season as it ends above the first barrier at the end of September. It's some of the best trout/salmon fishing in MN. Enjoy!"
flyfishing,3d867j,sureMOE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I know those are some of the best trout and salmon streams in the state. I've spent a lot of time up there too, especially hiking/skiing around all those state parks. Absolutely beautiful country. Never fished there, however. I was under the impression that the steelhead and salmon run was in April, though? Any insight on what the trout and salmon fishing is like at this time of year? If the bite's still decent, I'm going to try and make a weekend trip up there or make a stop when I head up to the BWCA in August."
flyfishing,3d867j,sureMOE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:14:44 2015 UTC,"April is huge for Steelies and Loopers and Sept/Oct is big for all the rest because of the fall run, but fish can be caught up there any time of the year. There's a lot of deep pools on rivers like The Temperance that can hold schools of fish throughout the summer as well as some on the Cross and Poplar. It's a bit of a mystery of what you will pull out (I pulled a small coho salmon out of a pool one summer day, which was a big surprise to me as I thought they were only in the rivers for the spawning runs). Pink Salmon show up only in the fall, as far as I am aware. Rainbows and brookies hold throughout much of the rivers all year long and can be caught above and below the barriers. You can also catch fish hanging around the mouths of the rivers during parts of the year. There are some large fish up there as well, my bests being about a 5lb Kamloop during a spring run and a 5lb Coaster (lake run brook trout) during the fall season. The best way to tackle the fish up there is through nymphing or streamer techniques since they like to hang out in deep pools. Your common nymphs should work as well as wooly buggers, eggs, egg sucking leeches and maribous...key is to have enough weight to get them down to the depths of the fish. If you have a free weekend, I would definitely give it a go up there. Gorgeous area, even if you aren't catching much! Good luck"
flyfishing,3d867j,Rabart,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:42:56 2015 UTC,That's great news. Thanks very much for all the info! I'll definitely have to make a stop up there this summer.

flyfishing,3d867j,troutangler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:58:54 2015 UTC,The Vermillion River is probably your closest trout stream. Most of it is catch and release for brown trout. The DNR stocks some rainbows in Farmington each spring but there probably aren't many left at this point. Hay Creek in Red Wing is a great stream that I have just started to explore. All brown trout with some special regulations on various stretches.

flyfishing,3d4w4n,CampBenCh,7,Mon Jul 13 15:28:00 2015 UTC,"So yesterday my fiancee wanted to go hiking since we went out Saturday to look at some caves and our trip was cut short due to a flat tire. Anyway so we decide to head into the Beartooth Mountains (Montana) for a quick 3.5 mile hike in to Elk Lake. I've been to the lake a couple times, and everything I have read says it is pretty much all brook trout. I've caught tons of brookies and even a young rainbow.   Yesterday wasn't a great day. I saw just one fish rise and it was pretty windy. So windy that some casts I had to just wait for the wind to die down before I could cast. It was also decently cold and rained on and off. After 30 minutes or so I got a couple bites from what looked like a decent fish.   Eventually I got a perfect cast to where the fish was and it took the blue lightning bug nymph I had on the end of my dry fly. I got it in and couldn't believe it! A Yellowstone Cutthroat in a lake that at most lists them as ""rare"". I've also never caught anything over 8"" out of the lake, and in a book the author mentions the largest fish coming out of the lake at 12.2"". This trout was definitely the most beautiful fish I have ever caught.   I only ended up fishing an hour or so after I caught it, and had just one more strike afterwards. There was one fish that was starting to rise before I left, but the rain was coming in harder and I couldn't feel my feet (because of the whole wading in a mountain lake without waders).   Even though it was just one fish, it was one of the best trips I've had!"

Tie your tippet to the greased up curly Q and fish a single lightly weighted fly on light tippet. You'll only be able to cast a French leader with a rod designed for euro nymphing. Be very stealthy with your approach.

flyfishing,3d67kt,_iFish,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"Two ways to approach it. On heavily pressured water the fish can get either really picky about what they eat, or they just will stop eating. If they are picky (which happens a lot less than people think) then you gotta go small and light. Size 18-22 with nothing for them to say no to like a walts or rs2.   If they don't like to eat (much more common) you should be throwing stupid junk flies and twitching it in front of their face. The weirder the better. One of my go to's is an inch long chartreuse turd of a fly.   Oh and always one fly in that situation. Be stealthy, take off studs on your boots, no bright clothing, etc."

I kind of enjoy exploring the tiny little streams around where I live.

flyfishing,3d1ww2,daniellinphoto,3,Sun Jul 12 21:23:19 2015 UTC,"Take it back to the fly shop and have them cast it on your rod. If they don't know how a rod will react to a line like that, they should. Don't go in all half cocked and they may let you grab the 8wt at least, maybe even just get store credit.   In their defense, overlining a fast actioned rod is very common practice (as I'm sure you know). Intermediate lines are not widely used so those folks were probably just miming off what the packaging says.   Worst comes to worst I'm sure there's some spey guys out there that would love to pick that line up at $50"
flyfishing,3d1ww2,_iFish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:39:02 2015 UTC,"After thinking about it further following the stream of consciousness mind-dump that was my OP, I think I'm just going to list it on Ebay and see what happens. It seems like the easiest solution to list a single item for sale, as opposed to registering (and paying) for various forum buy/sell groups, etc.  I think I'd rather not become ""that guy"" with this particular shop and mangle my relationship with them by coming in with a (still technically) used line claiming it casts like ass on my rod and that if possible I'd like an exchange for a totally different line. What I'm afraid is going to happen is that first they'll try to school me on casting basics, then we'll step out back and give it a few goes only to find out that it's entirely true and then they'll collectively blame the TiCrX, which they've explicitly told me that they don't stock as a TFO dealer because it's ""so fast even a 20-year fly fishing veteran can't double haul it right,"" which is the entire reason why I was advised to go with the 9wt line in the first place, going back to the ""saltwater line weights are accurate"" comment I made in my OP.  They're the second closest shop to me at 45 minutes away, and they carry all the weird brands my two other go-to shops don't carry that I like, such as Cutthroat leaders, Airflo lines and indicators, etc. etc. I'd simply rather not risk ruining my relationship with them over one totally misinformed purchase.  If I can move the line for $50 or so, I'll take it as a $30 lesson in not buying fly lines in a hurry and to let myself develop my own opinions on how rods and lines interact in terms of my own casting techniques instead of being fed from-the-script information from older guys who might be totally set in their ways and by no means reflect myself as a fly fisherman."
flyfishing,3d1ww2,_iFish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:06:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely a good way to go in that case.   Also, whenever a dealer tells you why they don't stock something, take it with a gallon of salt. They may have their reasons, but 1) they don't want you to buy that brand since they don't sell it and 2) they don't fish that brand so who are they to say anything about it.   TFO is a fine company, as good as any other. They are certainly different which isn't a bad thing, it just opens up more variety to us fishers.   Also, considering Lefty helps design their rods, perhaps what they consider a 20 year veteran is really a 15 year vet who took 5 years off and only fishes 2 days a year with guides :) I've actually fished your exact rod and its a darn good rod at that."

I think we have all been in shops like that, and honestly the best thing to do in my opinion is find a new shop. I have never thought twice about returning something to my fly shop and have exchanged used line because I didn't like how it cast. They exchanged it no questions asked."

(Remember, eBay+PayPal fees are 14% of the final sale).  I would mention to them, however, that the line was way too much for the TiCRx though.  Honestly, I would never overline a rod with a line like that (at least, not until I had tried some other lines on it). That line is at least half a weight up, if not a full line already. Meaning you were casting 9.5 or 10wt grains' worth of line. Not that is why I would but a little miffed at the shop. Maybe they don't throw TFO, and maybe they don't know what lines match up best, but they should at least know not to sell you out on a line that's 1.5-2 lines overweight."

flyfishing,3d1q12,Joseph7158,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:26:58 2015 UTC,"Without much backcast room, it'll be very difficult to do a standard overhead cast without getting caught in trees. For this situation, if you were okay with getting wet up to your knees, I'd recommend a switch rod, however no switch rod combo will be in budget. You'll be limited to doing mostly roll casts with the occasional overhand cast.   The best setup for that would be a longer rod of 9ft or more, and a heavy line with a short head. There are few beginner combos for that specifically so you'll probably be piecing the setup together yourself.   The Rio Outbound short or similar, in 7 or 8wt would be the best line, but probably out of budget.  For rods, any cheap 9ft+ 7 or 8wt rod will do just fine. It will be hard to find much more than a 9ft 8wt for cheap so you'll probably be there.   As for the reel, you can save a lot of money here as you won't need it for much more than a line holder. Cabelas, bass pro, or Okuma brand would be more than enough.   Keep all that in mind, check out different online retailers for names and prices, then head to a fly shop to have them set you up."

In a couple of weeks, our club is having a Swap Meet where members sell used gear super cheap (esp to newbies). PM me for details.  If that's not an option, then you may want to look into ""shorty"" rods that are specifically designed for bass. I know that Sage, TFO and Scott all make a 7.5-8ft rod designed for tight spaces and fishing structure, although even the TFO is like $250 so I'm not sure your budget is sufficient for those. Another favorite rod in your price point is the St. Croix Imperial, although it's a standard 9 footer."

flyfishing,3d15kh,internetnickname,3,Sun Jul 12 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"You'll find 8.5ft to be just fine. In contrast to spin fishing, a normal rod is generally 9ft in length, so yours in on average a little short.    To give you any more information, we'll have to know the weight rating of the rod. Often denoted #5 or 5wt (probably not 5).   You are right in the rod, reel, line, leader, tippet, and flies. You'll also want some backing for the reel as well. Other than that, you're pretty much set to get at it.   For trout, sizes are also denoted by #'s. Trout generally are caught using between #6 (on the large end) to #18 (on the small end). Many people use smaller than #18 for trout, but it is often not needed and difficult for beginners. #12-16 on dries and nymphs, and #8-12 for streamers is a reasonable simplification.   I didn't watch the whole thing, but this video should show you how to set up the rig"
flyfishing,3d15kh,_iFish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the input, it's really helpful.  So I checked my rod and it lists no information other than the type (True Temper) 300x 8 1/2.  So there is no identifying information as to what the weight rating is.  Apparently from googling this is a vintage rod, who knows how long this was in the guy's garage.  It is exactly this rod:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-TRUE-TEMPER-FLY-FISHING-ROD-X300-8-1-2-FIBERGLASS-USA-/111701504533  How could I go about finding the weight rating?"
flyfishing,3d15kh,_iFish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:40:09 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one to figure out. Basically you have to throw a bunch of different lines with it until it feels right. Obviously that will be difficult for a beginner who isn't familiar with how a rod should feel.   Maybe take it to a fly shop? They often have many different weighted lines on reels so people can test cast rods. Perhaps pick up a reel, backing, and tell them the situation. If they aren't busy they might be willing to take it out and figure out the line weight.   In my experience, most fly rods of that age and type are 6 or 7wts. That is not nearly exact, but its the best I can give."
flyfishing,3d15kh,_iFish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:26:28 2015 UTC,I really appreciate the help.  If you don't mind - what exactly should it feel like when casting out?   Or rather would an improperly rated line not be possible to cast correctly at all or would it just be much more difficult or funky feeling?   If it's just going to feel strange then as a newb I'll prob buy some off your recommendation (I believe I even a forum mention similar) and see if I can make it work.   I won't notice a difference with no comparison haha.   Thanks again.

flyfishing,3cyagk,internetnickname,2,Sat Jul 11 21:43:28 2015 UTC,Looks like he forgot to give you the reel housing.  You have 2 pflueger medalist spools but are missing the reel.
flyfishing,3cyagk,harlji,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:53:35 2015 UTC,Ah I see.  Is it worth it/even possible to buy the reel housing or should I just get a new reel?  If it's feasible I'd obviously love to save the cash haha
flyfishing,3cyagk,_iFish,2,Sat Jul 11 22:17:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Pleugars are dirt cheap (not because of bad quality, just a simple design). Buy a reel and you'll have 3 spare spools! Just make sure you get the same size reel as the spools."
flyfishing,3cyagk,OldMustang,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"This is good advice if you can find a pflueger with the right housing or frame to fit those spools. A lot of fly fisherman would carry multiple spools to fit a given frame - one spool might have sinking line for nymphs or wet flies, another might have floating line for dry flies, or another might have a shooting head line for casting into the wind, or just a different color line that the fisherman would prefer at dusk, for instance. Don't spend a lot of money on a fly reel - it is just for holding the line. Some folks are proponents of fighting the fish on the reel, but I think most fly fisherman use a hand retrieve with a fish on, and when casting, you are stripping line off the reel before casting it anyway, so the reel doesn't do much besides store the line. Have fun! When you catch your first fish on a dry fly, you will be hooked for good."

flyfishing,3cy9xj,hank_hiIl,3,Sat Jul 11 21:38:33 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'd do. Take all the line off of it, and grease all the bearings and moving parts. Go out and buy yourself some braided backing line. It's not mono. It feels kind of like rope, but it's pretty tough. Tie the backing line onto your fly reel. From there, tie the fly line (the thick colored line) to you backing. Then tie on your monofilament. Backing->fly line-> monofilament->fly->fish."

Here check this out. Redington has a guide showing you all the knots with a little map for setting up your reel. http://www.redington.com/fly-fishing/knot-tying/ It may seem a little confusing at first since there are a few parts to the fly line set up, but once you understand the components it will make a lot more sense."

flyfishing,3cvzq0,luke-cbr,2,Sat Jul 11 06:09:56 2015 UTC,Luke -   Good questions. You would just have to cut down on the amount of backing that you put on the reel if you are to load it with a 10 weight line. Also the most adverse effects that you may find associated with doing this will be with the balance of the reel & rod combo. I hope this helps man  Thx  J.

flyfishing,3cvzq0,RoverLife,2,Sat Jul 11 11:57:13 2015 UTC,Depends more on the rod than the reel to be honest. If it's a heavy 10wt line on a soft 6-7wt rod with the 8wt reel the rod may not have the backbone for the 10wt line

Best thing to do would be to hit up a local fly shop, personally I really love the guys at the Rivers Edge in Bozeman, they have two locations as well, ask them for tips on locations of the river to fish. Fishing the lower Madison, in the canyon and below has very easy access. Theres a dirt road that follows at least one side of the river for 10 miles or so that is lined with camp grounds, so its very easy to get wadding access.

In recent years, large mouth bass and other species have been introduced to most waterways. Trout are not an invasive species they've been breed in U.S rivers and streams for thousands of years to the point that individual species have evolved. Unfortunately, they are often preyed upon by pike, and LMB in my state. To say trout are an invasive specie... Well I find that statement laughable."

flyfishing,3cq5nl,SirTrout,3,Fri Jul 10 06:42:21 2015 UTC,"invasive    It might be a good idea if you learn the difference between invasive species vs non natives.  INVASIVE SPECIES  Invasive species are non-native plants, animals, or other organisms that did not historically occur in Maine. When introduced to Maine ecosystems, they develop abundant, widespread populations that negatively impact the environment, the economy, human health, or the way we live. Common reed, variable watermilfoil, and Chinese mitten crabs are examples of species that are invasive to Maine.  NATIVE SPECIES  Maine’s native species are plants, animals, or other organisms that have historically occurred and evolved in Maine ecosystems. Milkweed, rock crabs, and little floating heart are examples of species that are native to Maine.  NON-NATIVE SPECIES  Non-native species have been either intentionally or accidentally introduced to Maine by humans or their activities. Non-native species do not cause environmental or economic harm. An important, not-to-be-missed distinction between non-native species and invasive species is that non-native species do not disrupt the natural functions and processes of our native ecosystems. Check out Mission: Sea Potato and Mission: Hungry, Hungry, Beetles for two non-native species that students and scientists are investigating.   Getting off my soap box now."

If you wan to fish for chub as a fly fisherman, have fun, but I have no idea what your doing."

flyfishing,3cqwza,scruffyswisewords,3,Fri Jul 10 01:35:09 2015 UTC,I only fly fish from my kayaks and I love it!   You can cover so much more water than wading or with a toon.   I just sold my toon because my Feelfree Lure 11.5 works as well if not better than the toon.   The Lure has a clean deck so your fly line will not get tangled and you can stand up and cast a fly rod with no problem.    It's very wide so going up river takes more effort.   So I have a 2nd narrower  kayak for that and let my friends use it when they want to come along.   Sorry for the typing I'm on my phone.
flyfishing,3cqwza,SirTrout,2,Fri Jul 10 17:01:56 2015 UTC,"So the great thing about kayak fishing is that you can really get your set up customized to exactly what you need to get the job done. I use my yak for both fishing and accessibility to different spots throughout the lakes near me in S. FL. I would recommend a sit on top kayak, mainly because stability is far better on sit on tops. If you get a better quality one, it may be stable enough to stand on, but otherwise you can look up how to make cheap DIY pontoons to add the stability needed to stand on your yak, that's what I did. Either way, you can get the fishing done on your yak no problem."

I bungee a milk crate on the front and fly fish from it. I can't imagine using anything else. You get a great view since you're standing up; plus a natural casting position. Those boards are a lot more stable than you might think, as long as you don't get one thats too small.   Edit: you can really sneak up on the fish too. I was finished fishing for the evening and was paddling back through some weeds. A few times I ended up almost paddling right over bass that did see me coming. I could have poked them with my paddle. I'm not saying a kayak can't do that, but I probably wouldn't have seen them from a kayak since you are so close to the water."
flyfishing,3cqwza,blatherdrift,2,Fri Jul 10 19:28:01 2015 UTC,"I fly fish from  kayak pretty successfully.  it's hard at first but even spin fishing is hard at first in a yak.  once you work out a system it's very doable and really the ultimate level of stealth.   one thing I noticed is that it's pretty hard to fly fish when moving so I like to anchor up and work a pool slowly. Drift out, anchor up and work another weed line. I use a Ride 135 which is no problem for standing. Anchored up, anyone can stand on a pontoon bottomed kayak imo.   I went the short rod route and bought a sage bass rod. It's easier to work with but I can see how a tall rod would be easier to keep the line above the water. Learn a roll cast and you'll be fine ."

flyfishing,3cqwza,I_Smoke_OG,2,Wed Jul 15 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"There are several kayaks designed for what you want to do. Usually they're sit-on-tops with some extra width.   I can speak for the NuCanoe, as that's what I went with. It's a piece of cake to stand on and cast from. I would second the opinion that it's important to get a good anchor system for maximum usefulness. It allows you to get to really good casting positions, even better than you would have from the shore. The fly casting kayaks aren't going to be as fast as normal kayaks, but they're much faster and more maneuverable than a john boat."

(smallest on the Delaware and largies in the Poconos)  I've got long legs and big feet, so the wide cockpit and tall profile is welcome.  The seat is comfy, and you can bring your knees up easily to relieve stiff legs.  The fact that its only 10 feet means modest speed/efficiency, but you can turn on a dime, and its width makes you feel real stable while casting.      I prefer sit in because you tend to stay drier, and they seem more reliable in the minor rapids you find on larger Smallmouth rivers.    Hope that helped!"

flyfishing,3cop3p,thagoodlife,5,Thu Jul 9 15:27:41 2015 UTC,"I strongly suggest reading that sticky that's been up there for a few days.  I'm an Oregon guide, and can tell you the water temps down here are extreme.  Most guides (at least the ethical ones) have hung it up for the season.  The Deschutes especially is running unbelievably warm right now.  With the night time low temps still above where it's safe to fight fish and ensure survival.  Keep in mind, 68f is the highest temp you should fish for trout and steelhead.  Many would say give it a buffer and top it at 65f.    Watch this graph if you're intent on going:  http://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?site_no=14103000"
flyfishing,3cop3p,notmy_realusername,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:34:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, I did read the sticky. The guide I am going with said that we are going to be fishing near the dam where it's a tailwater, so the water will be much colder than the rest of the river."
flyfishing,3cop3p,notmy_realusername,2,Thu Jul 9 17:40:27 2015 UTC,Yeah it's been hovering around 60f around there.  Main reason why I didn't opt to do guiding there this summer is because everyone is piling in to that section of river now since it's one of the only places in the state with water not over 70f this summer.
flyfishing,3cop3p,steelheadbum,2,Thu Jul 9 17:50:49 2015 UTC,"I believe it's a bit early to think about that portion of the Deschutes and have any real expectations of hooking a steelhead. As notmy_realusername stated, it's been unseasonably hot. The lower reaches of the river are where the fish are,  and that section of the river is a bake oven.  In my opinion,  wait a couple of months and then come up to Oregon. Say mid to late September.  FYI: former guide on the Deschutes."
flyfishing,3cop3p,steelheadbum,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:53:52 2015 UTC,"Oh and the swing is the way to go, IMO.

flyfishing,3cmug0,cheatcodez,2,Thu Jul 9 03:53:44 2015 UTC,"Good question -- I think for the 6/0 you're at about 4x for the tip of an 8' leader, but it's adjustable depending on how many loops you make of each section."

flyfishing,3cmug0,Snapitlikeabullwhip,2,Thu Jul 9 16:20:22 2015 UTC,did you make a jig? i never got around to building a jig.   how did you choose your colors?   does it have to be fly tying thread?
flyfishing,3cmug0,alfiegee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:00:24 2015 UTC,"did you make a jig? i never got around to building a jig.    I did, after a fashion -- a board with two cup hooks and some deck screws for the ""dowels"".    how did you choose your colors?    I only had the two colours of thread from tying flies, so it limited my choices somewhat. the olive seemed the standard for the cutthroat leaders, so I went for it.    does it have to be fly tying thread?   I doubt it, but from what I've read the Uni thread is more uniform in size and strength through the whole length of the bobbin. Seemed a wise choice, given that, and it's certainly thinner and stronger than the sewing thread I used to use for fly tying."

Essentially when you get a new rod, it's cursed with the inability to catch fish, so whenever one of us gets a new rod we banter each other about catching the first fish with it to ""break the curse"".  What kind of rod are you getting? :)"
flyfishing,3cmn5m,oleTan,3,Thu Jul 9 02:21:01 2015 UTC,It'll be a little more accurate and delicate but you do lose most of your distance.   Either way for smaller trout streams a 5wt is about as big a line as you want. Too big a line and they'll spook pretty easily.   Try and find some cheapo 5wt line and see how it does!
flyfishing,3cmn5m,_iFish,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:28:15 2015 UTC,"You can find a rod/reel/line setup for almost the same price as a good line.  I do trout streams primarily and it pays off to have the smaller rod because of brush and overhangs.  I really would suggest just getting a new setup, I think you will find it to be more enjoyable.  LLBean has a pretty decent out of the gate trout setup for like 120 dollars.  Take that setup versus a good Airflo flyline and you can see for only 40 bucks more you have everything you need.    I used a very similar setup when I got into trout streams and it was great.  When I first started I was trying to find a single rod that could go between larger streams and smaller trout streams but I ultimately discovered two setups was the best solution."
flyfishing,3cmn5m,sisko2k5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:31:44 2015 UTC,"I'd rather get a 2/3wt setup and overline it. I HATE underlined rods, I typically go 1 or 2 weights up"
flyfishing,3cmn5m,RoverLife,3,Thu Jul 9 12:53:03 2015 UTC,"That's because today's rods are really built for a full line up.  The speed of graphite rods has increased and fly line manufacturers are increasing the size of their lines to keep up, but some rods are pretty much built to be overlined. The one I can think of off the top of my head is the Method. I've heard of people going two lines up to slow that thing down. This has caused insane amounts of nuance in today's gear selection..."

flyfishing,3cez27,pattyfatsax,2,Tue Jul 7 14:30:47 2015 UTC,"What are you fishing for in saltwater? I only recommend the encounter as a beginner rod. It doesn't have the Orvis 25 year guarantee, only a limited warranty, for starters. I really like my Orvis Clearwater, and the new Recon is pretty sick too. Of course, the Helios 2 are their top of the line rods and for a reason. I was on a salt trip and used H2s from 7-11wt and they were amazing.   If you aren't committed to Orvis, check out the Redington Predator. I have a 7wt predator with a closed drag reel w/a fresh and saltwater spool for them. This would work on bass as well as your inshore saltwater species."
flyfishing,3cez27,Bmont35,2,Tue Jul 7 14:59:30 2015 UTC,All of your suggestions except for the clear water are super expensive. I want something like $200 or less. Also I fish for all inshore saltwater species

Every aspect of it is made in China so you lose the quality control of the manchester rod shop. If you have a retail store by you, ask if they are still doing classes (you get a 20% discount on ClearWater and H2 outfits if you show interest in a 101 class). Even if you can't do that a good 5-6 wt outfit with the much better CW line and a decent real, and wont set you back more than 280. Plus the 25 year guarantee is awesome. I've watched my brother step on a split bamboo and had a brand new one shipped right to my house. Ask about the new recon at 425 it is the closest orvis has ever come to the quality of the Helios 2 at half the price"

flyfishing,3cez27,Bmont35,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:41:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly go out and cast a couple different rods, weather it's Orvis, Sage, Winston, Scott, TFO ect. If you fish a lot, think about the warranty for each manufacturer because you don't want to buy a rod only to have to spend just as much replacing it if it breaks. I have fished both the Encounter 5wt as well as the 8wt, and for the price I think it not only serves your purpose, but it will be a step up from your White River. A good buddy of mine who has been a guide for a long time told me to start fishing with lower quality rods so that when I want to spend the money on higher quality then I can actually FEEL the difference. I have been more than happy with my Encounter, but I also own a Recon 4wt and it puts a smile on my face every time I cast that rod. It's very smooth loading and unloading, they have built the flex of the rod based on the weight so I feel that makes a big difference. I also own an 8wt in the H2 because that thing is a canon on the salt, and is extremely forgiving when it comes to accuracy which is key to salty fishing. All that being said, if I break my Encounter it's $50 to replace. If I break my Recon or H2 it's $30 for anytime as many times over the next 25 years. Orvis also has a not-so-well-known upgrade program so if you decide to get a less expensive warranty rod like the Clearwater $198 freshwater, $225 saltwater, and you happen to break it you have an option of upgrading to the Helios2 for a little over $300. No matter what you decide to do, supply yourself with as much information as you can before spending the money. It helps to have friends in the industry because we get to test each other's newest purchases on the water, and it really gives you an idea of performance without having to spend the money first. Good luck with whatever you decide."

flyfishing,3cikb4,Delerium89,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:40:44 2015 UTC,"With all due respect to /u/FLORI_DUH, having a line overloaded to begin with has very real practical implications. Overlining a rod is generally due to improve casting distance, which as he/she mentioned comes with many downsides. HOWEVER that is what this line's taper was purpose built to do in the first place. It makes total sense that if you are going to build a line to throw huge casts and not much else, then it should be lined heavier.   I agree the AFTMA standard of rating fly lines is often a bit confusing and redundant, but it does keep things simple when it comes to different tapers. Spey guys will tell you that depending on the taper, their lines may different in weight as up to 20% total weight. I fish 3 different line sizes on my rod because each has difference purposes, has a different taper, and consequently is weighted different. All 3 match my rod well, even though none of them is an AFTMA match for my rod.   As for the line in question, as I said it was purpose built to throw big flies a long ways. With that comes a lack of accuracy, a lack of control after the cast (mending/general fishability). It would make for a great lake or ocean line where you just need to get distance quick. It makes sense for streamer fishing for the same reasons. This line would suck all possible genetalia at mending a dry fly or nymph rig.   What you should be doing in regards to buying a fly line is to think about how you fish. Do you fish mostly dries, indicators, streamers, or do you want a general purpose line. From there, decide on what kind of taper you want in a line. NOW AND ONLY NOW decide on what weight you should buy. Because the folks are Rio are kind enough to shift the #'s around for you, you should be able to buy whatever your rod says and get reasonably close.   I should also say that Rio and Sage are owned by the same parent company so you can be darned sure that any rio lines are going to be tested on your rod."
flyfishing,3cikb4,_iFish,0,Wed Jul 8 23:49:09 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical of any flyline that is ""one full line size heavier than industry standard"". I mean, doesn't that defeat the whole point of having an industry standard? The reason manufacturers do this is the same reason that flyrods are getting stiffer and stiffer...it's because most people who buy this stuff (and drive the demand for new products) can't fucking cast. They can't properly load a 5wt rod with 5wt line because their timing is awful, so instead of addressing technique, they just buy a heavier flyline that makes the rod easier to load. Now they can slop out 30 feet of line instead of 20. Problem solved! What they don't understand is that over-lining rods has numerous downsides, including greatly reduced accuracy and stealth and difficulty casting in the wind. Not to mention that line is bright green, which may be good for blind old dudes who can't see 30 feet ahead but is going to further reduce any chance you had at stealth. The thing is OP, it's impossible to look at stats and know which line will work with a given rod. You have to actually get out and cast with it to know. And in doing so, you'll find that different people have different opinions on whether or not a certain line-rod combo is ""good"" based on their own individual casting style. I guess this is a super-long-winded way of saying that the only way to know if a combo is good or not is to try it yourself. Next time you go fishing with a friend, swap reels and try a different line on your rod to see what you think of it. Or just buy this line and give it a shot...you may find that it fits your style regardless of my criticisms."
flyfishing,3cikb4,FLORI_DUH,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:37:20 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely zero advantage to uplining a flyrod. All you're doing is compensating for a poor casting stroke, and/or for a rod that's too stiff for the line it was supposedly designed for. It's just a crutch that is going to slow down the improvement of your casting stroke. As for flyline color, you're right, it doesn't usually matter, and it should be the least of your concerns. But there are times when it does matter."

The fish are aplenty there and not shy of biting anything. Not huge fish, but lots of them.  Far: Up North Michigan is beautiful in the winter, and you have TONS of water to yourself. The run up there has been a bit slow the past few years, but you will run into a few fish and have them all to yourself.

flyfishing,3cd8qx,jfred17,2,Tue Jul 7 11:41:55 2015 UTC,One successful fly for large brown trout is a mouse pattern.  You read that right: mouse pattern.
flyfishing,3cd8qx,Waelsleahta,2,Tue Jul 7 19:39:43 2015 UTC,One of the biggest brown trout that I ever caught was on a brown field mouse pattern in a creek about 5 feet wide. We tossed the flies across the creek right before a bend and pulled them into the water. Most of the fish that we hooked wee in the 12-16 inch range but there were a few 20+ inch Browns that we netted that weekend. Whenever I go back to that part of the mountain I tie up a couple of brown and grey field mice just in case.

I have very VERY small hands and with a fish that big I run a serious risk of dropping the fish if it fights at all and that would be even more damaging to the fish. I keep my fingers as shallow in it's mouth as possible, and when I put it back in the water I help it filter some oxygen through its gills and all that. So while it is an evil, it's a necessary one for me but I do it as carefully as I possibly can. I really do care about the welfare of the fish and if you have any recommendations for someone with very small hands handling bigger fish safely I would appreciate it! :)"

I never even touched him (even though I don't think it's terrible to support a fish w both hands for a quick pic)!   tl;dr: grab some shots of the fish in a net if you're worried about handling them and possibly dropping them.

Slide your index and middle finger along the inside of the Y from back to front towards the pikes nose... If your fingers start getting raked STOP you're doing it wrong lol this is best demonstrated not explained, however it is the only way to handle big fish... Two hands horizontally is impossible with any decent sized pike when you combine their slime, girth, and flopping around... Try searching on YouTube it's the most common way of properly handling these fish"
flyfishing,3cb54w,Kilgore403,2,Mon Jul 6 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"I've seen that done before.. but it always by someone holding the fish vertically, which you shouldn't do to a large fish.  Using a cradle is the only safe way to handle the larger guys.  I find it easy to just reach under them and grab near the pectoral fins, sort of how I'd handle a steelhead.  I've never really had issues.  It hurts me to see this on Field & Stream.  They should know better."
flyfishing,3cb54w,steelie34,3,Mon Jul 6 19:23:17 2015 UTC,The proper way to hold them doesn't involve coming into contact with the gills at all... It's no different than holding them on the outside skin as you have no contact with vital tissue... The good thing about my method is that only people who know what they're doing will actually try it... Because if you make one wrong move its a major problem lol I just found it easier on the 20-30lb pike to hold this way... Does no damage to the fish and they're always released properly... That being said I agree it's absolutely not right to hold them like this vertically... The underside of the fish always needs support by the other hand
flyfishing,3cb54w,Kilgore403,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you know what you're doing.. versus most of the guys who don't, and end up reaching all the way into the gill plate because they ""saw"" someone do it like that.

flyfishing,3cb54w,steelie34,5,Tue Jul 7 11:29:06 2015 UTC,"Don't grab any fish you intend to release through the gill plate.  Pike are best handled by holding horizontally under the belly and tail.  They do throw in an occasional post-catch shake, so make sure you are close to the water when you do hold them, not 5 feet above the ground or boat.  There are several pike friendly nets out there, you should look into getting one.  If you're targeting trophy pike, you may also want to look at a cradle net."
flyfishing,3cb54w,steelie34,2,Mon Jul 6 15:27:53 2015 UTC,I agree with the horizontal hold. I've caught quite a few Pike on the fly from my kayak and this is my go to hold. It's great because it works on little guys and monsters. Plus it keeps you away from all those teeth! Good luck out there!

I had a 70 year old man walk down the river and I explained to him that I'm new and I'm sorry if I impeded in his fishing spot. He then stood with me for upwards of 20 minutes telling me the do's and don't of North American fly fishing. He asked to see my fly box and just started handing me his own hand tied flies. He gave me 4, and I tied one on immediately (I think he called it a prince)  He told me to go down the river just past the ripples and just let it lay there.

flyfishing,3cbmxm,robutmike,3,Mon Jul 6 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"So here's my two cents..  While the body of water you will be fishing is important, just as if not more so, is the targeted species. 'some small KY streams' is a confusing description for some members here who aren't familiar with your waters. 'Small' can be very very different for different areas. I fish some streams that I can literally jump across. That would have me directing you one way, but then in a comment above (or below) you mention fishing the same rod from a boat.. ..which would have me leading you a bit differently..  So give us the targeted species (bass vs trout vs whatever it may be--this will affect whether your reel is a line holder or a drag important/necessary tool) and a better description of the size of water and we'll try to be more specific in our recommendations.   A price point is also a great addition.."
flyfishing,3cbmxm,dahuii22,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:02:14 2015 UTC,"All of the wading streams you could jump across in many places. Those streams, you couldnt really bring a boat of any size. In those areas, I fish mainly for small mouth bass or stocked trout (small rainbows, brook, and a few browns)  However, there are some lakes I go to sometimes and take my boat. I usually fish with non-fly fishing gear in those areas, but have considered trying it out for some bass and bluegill.  Price point would love to spend less than $200."

flyfishing,3cbmxm,steelie34,2,Tue Jul 7 13:17:04 2015 UTC,"Fellow Kentuckian here.. any chance you'll be fishing from a kayak or canoe in these streams?  If you are, then you definitely want a 9 footer.. It will help get your line up above the water when your casting from a sitting position.  Overhanging brush shouldn't be too much of a problem, you just need to practice a sidearm cast.  I wouldn't recommend anything shorter than 9' anyway, unless you already have good casting form.  I think a big mistake beginners make is getting a shorter rod, and then giving up when they can't immediately get the casts to lay down properly.    As far as brands, just go with something relatively cheap.  Until you get the hang of it and want to finely tune your skills, there isn't really any reason to get brand x over y, etc.. My first rod was a Gander Mountain 9' medium action, and it did the job quite nicely."
flyfishing,3cbmxm,Mackhasarack,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:43:04 2015 UTC,Definitely will be doing some fishing from a boat from time to time. I just like wading streams mainly.  The rod I have now (the starter Martin) seems pretty stiff.
flyfishing,3cbmxm,cabose4prez,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:52:57 2015 UTC,"Stiff isn't bad, you just need to remember you don't have to load it up as much during the cast.  It might actually provide an easier time in tight fishing spots.  Also you get the added bonus of being able to turn over heavier flies (which is good for bass.)    I have a very stiff steelhead rod I use for deep water nymphing and such.  I get better hooksets with the faster action, but the tradeoff is making sure I really control my drag well.. the fish has much more leverage during the fight since I can't absorb shock as well.  There's pros and cons to each, but really what it comes down to is the target fish and type of fly.  Any 5-6 wt medium or fast will work well around here for pretty much all species.  Unless you're one of those crazy dudes that chases muskies with the fly.."
flyfishing,3cbmxm,DankKabra,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think thats my main issue. Not able to feel it load up I guess. I can cast it ok all things considered.  Not chasing any muskies yet hehe."
flyfishing,3cbmxm,DankKabra,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:15:13 2015 UTC,I believe I bought the same rod for my first. If it's the same it's a 7/8 wt. and that's a big part of why it's stiff. I bought a 5 wt. This past weekend  and it's got much more action.
flyfishing,3cbmxm,DankKabra,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:08:53 2015 UTC,"If you have never fly fished before the Martin combo reel will be fine. Go to a local pond and practice casting before going on the creek trying to deal with fish and trees.  For your rod length 8ft to 9ft would be what I would go with, seams long compared to spinning or bait casting rods but once you get the feel for it, it will be very easy to use in the small woody streams."

I might get to go down to cumberland river a couple of times in the summer for larger trout.  Would the 8'6"" 4wt be versatile enough for those?

One day i will stop by there though. It will probably be on my way home from the millers though just to check it out."
flyfishing,3c8uku,herrbrau,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:23:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely a ""unique"" fishery. If you like technical fishing with small flies, there are some pretty big fish there. When freestones are high or warm, the Swift remains productive.  If you have flexibility with your schedule, which I don't much, it shouldn't be too busy early on weekdays. And, it was mostly empty of anglers in the winter."

I am curious is this is on the larger size for browns that they put in mass rivers? I caught almost 10 rainbows equal or larger then this guy but all in all the biggest fish i catch in the rivers are usually 16-18 inch. Beautiful fun fighting fish but do they ever put a 4-5 lber in? Even a nice 3 lb 20"" would be beaut. I'm strictly talking rivers here as well."
flyfishing,3c8uku,EuroNymphGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:49:02 2015 UTC,"Great question. IDK, to be honest.  Your fish in the very least has been stocked quite a bit ago, as newly-stocked fish--including browns--have an un-natural silvery sheen to them. Or, it's a holdover. Fish grow about 1/2"" each month, FYI.  Regardless, that's a heck of a fish and you should feel incredibly proud about such an accomplishment."

flyfishing,3c86lq,fon10alis,2,Sun Jul 5 22:08:45 2015 UTC,No problem. The CRAA has been trying to establish an Atlantic run in the credit for years. Even to the detriment of the other migratory and permanent populations.
flyfishing,3c86lq,fon10alis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:55:52 2015 UTC,I'm kind of confused now. I was just fishing silver creek in norval and caught something similar looking to this but it didn't have the orange on the bottom. Is that a brookie also?
flyfishing,3c86lq,troutful,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"It could have been. I think brook trout are native to a few of the Credit Tribs. However, many of these cold water tributaries have had restoration work which could include stocking of brown and/or rainbow trout. So it could have been any of the three trouts, or a salmon (I think a juvenile salmon is pretty rare).   Every brook trout I have caught in Ontario, which likely numbers over a few thousand, Ive been able to tell it was a brook trout.  The black bars along its back leading to dots of camouflage (other trout/salmon have dots or squarish dots, leading to rounder dots)  the squarish tail, and white tips to the fins. Some are brighter then others and the colours really pop in the fall, but they always have the same hues.   You may have caught a brown trout? It may have been newly stocked fish and could be silvery, having similar features with a silver belly but darker back.    When the three are soft in colour, the spots usually give them away. Browns have dark spots (brown to black) with intermittent redish spots (sometimes this can be almost fluorescent pink). Rainbows just have dark spots (brown to black) and Brooks have dark spots, but they also have yellow and red spots!"
flyfishing,3c86lq,fon10alis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:27:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Probably juvenile Brown. It's rare for rainbow or any salmon to be north of the Georgetown area.   I think they try and keep the migratory steelhead and salmon separate from the native browns and brookies to maintain both populations. (Using dams and fish ladders).  However, not to say it is not possible to have any species anywhere."
flyfishing,3c86lq,brokentippet,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting, the majority of the fish that we caught at the forks of the credit were rainbows! That makes sense about the fish ladder because I've noticed that we catch steelhead above it but mostly brook and brown below it I believe."
flyfishing,3c86lq,troutful,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"Are you sure they weren't browns? From the Grange Line Bridge to Cataract Falls, I dont remember catching any rainbows, however I have caught many browns."
flyfishing,3c86lq,troutful,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:37:48 2015 UTC,100% sure. Rainbows are what I've been catching the most so I've got a fairly good idea of what they look like now I think. On top of that I just caught a brown trout a few minutes ago and they have much different colouring.
flyfishing,3c86lq,brokentippet,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:59:09 2015 UTC,Might be wrong on my fish I.D. Caught some rainbows about double to triple this size but the fish show up completely white because of the sun in the photos.

flyfishing,3c86lq,isavage75,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:50:51 2015 UTC,Nice brook! Doubt there would be any Atlantic's that far north of the lake. I've fished the lower credit years and only have caught one Atlantic.

flyfishing,3c7ab7,ReallyHungry,-5,Sun Jul 5 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"You have an option to hold a fish in a manner that is certainly safer and more comfortable for it, and yet you still choose the method that is only slightly more convenient for you while still posing a risk to the fish. I don't understand how, as a sportsman, you can be happy doing this.   As to the argument of this technique being acceptable for fish under a certain weight, does it really matter? Is it a big no-no to hold a fish weighing three pounds in this manner while it is acceptable for a two and a half pound fish? One might say that once the weight reaches a certain point that this method of holding the fish puts too much pressure on its jaw, but even assuming the fish is still small/young, one can't be certain that their connective tissue/ligaments/tendons are strong enough to handle the stresses.  It may be totally fine for the fish, but the issue lies in whether it truly is the best way to handle the animal."

flyfishing,3c7gss,BeckerHollow,7,Sun Jul 5 16:33:31 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're not letting the line fully load the rod on both the back and front casts.  Watch the line and ensure the loop straightens out before changing directions.  Also, keep the rod tip in a horizontal plane while casting and push your arm in and out from you, while minimizing the bending of your wrist."
flyfishing,3c7gss,JCuc,3,Sun Jul 5 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"This might sound silly, but make sure you start casting when you have a few feet of line out past the last guide on your rod. I've seen people try to work the tippet, leader, and line out by false casting and it does not work."

flyfishing,3c7gss,_iFish,3,Mon Jul 6 03:23:28 2015 UTC,"When casting you should be able to feel your line load on your back cast, to me it sounds like you're not letting it quite enough. You will be able to feel it when you cast right as the feeling is so beautiful. Possible try using a large streamer to practice so you can really feel it load."

Most of the time I'm just looking up at the line, making sure I have a good shape to it, and I see that it sometimes just falls early and has no power. So you're saying use something weighted? Like a lure maybe? So I can really feel it more and then work myself back down to flys?"
flyfishing,3c7gss,randoh12,2,Sun Jul 5 17:11:40 2015 UTC,"Brother, I feel your frustrations! One of the hardest part of fly fishing is the learning curve in casting. It has frustrated millions before you and it will frustrate milions afterward. You are not alone.  As far as advice goes, I will suggest easing up on the strict 10-3 and spend some time watching your fly, tippet and leader go back and forth until you find your timing and method. You will have to find what works for you as far as your own rhythm. I hope this helps even though it was basic. There are probably other factors in casting that the wiki could help with, or maybe watching videos on youtube.   But it sounds like a rhythm and timing thing in your back cast. Or maybe it is where you load up the rod and release before the line has made it's loop to properly unload the energy to the line. Instead, it sounds like it unloads it on to a slack or loose section of the line, thus the jambled pile of knots and loops."
flyfishing,3c7gss,randoh12,2,Sun Jul 5 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I feel it just happens though. Like as I start the forward cast I don't feel any weight on it and I look up and it's just cutting through all the line. I know it's pretty much over then. Sometimes I get lucky and it just all falls in the water, or just requires an unravel or two.    But I guess there's no way to avoid it once it starts happening, is there?"
flyfishing,3c7gss,qft,2,Sun Jul 5 17:09:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it definitely sounds like the timing is off. Like another user mentioned, get a streamer or larger fly on there to properly ""feel the weight"" of the back cast and when it can be  loaded from the rod energy. You will get through this I promise."
flyfishing,3c7gss,SpeedyLights,2,Sun Jul 5 17:19:10 2015 UTC,"you will get though this I promise.    Next time I'm out there half strangled to death in 100' of knots I'll be screaming ""/u/randoh12, you lying mother, I hate you.""   Haha. Thanks, I'll be keeping at it. I think a lesson is in my future."
flyfishing,3c7gss,pettwer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"I actually don't like using big ass streamers, the weight feels funny to me and they'll hook you if you're poor with your casting. Try some yarn.  Sounds like you're not waiting enough on your back cast. Your back cast should take just as long as your front. Cast back, wait for the line to extend, THEN go forward. It'll load the rod that way. You'll feel the resistance in the rod when you do it right."
flyfishing,3c7gss,qGqGq,2,Tue Jul 7 22:16:26 2015 UTC,"Spending some time with someone proficient at casting will make a world of difference. It has for me over the last few years. Do you have any experience friends, or a local fly shop nearby? Sometimes they will offer free casting 101 lessons.   At the least, get on YouTube and watch some videos. When you're practicing in the yard, try watching your back cast.   Whatever you do, don't give up on it!"

flyfishing,3c7gss,lackrays,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:29:42 2015 UTC,"When you say 10-3, do you mean you're reaching horizontal on the backcast? I wouldn't go past 2, and somewhere between 1 and 2 might be even better depending on your rod.   Try stopping your fore- and backcasts at different angles and see what works best on your rod."

I can get your casting right pretty quick if you can relax for 5 seconds haha.   Edit: that wasn't meant to be overly snarky, but I'd bet money most of your casting problems stem from your frustration. Relax, get the timing, and the rest will come."
flyfishing,3c7gss,Guvnarrr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:00:41 2015 UTC,"Just a beginner myself, watching youtube videos. Some wise old man said if your line gets tangled all the time the rod shakes while casting. To stop this slow down and do a smooth acceleration to a stop so the rod doesn't vibrate when starting/ending the cast. Start the cast slowly and then accelerate so the leader doesn't get waggled at the start of the cast, this is the best video i've found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVGHjL4zRy0  i think it's from the 1970's or something. But I suck at casting so just tie a string to a bee and let it fly over the water."
flyfishing,3c7gss,qft,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:49:36 2015 UTC,"I am in a similar position, just started again after 15 years. Whenever I get a tangle it's nearly always down to my false cast being too vertical.  I found this video really good. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl0yc7LwWrk&index=6&list=PLB995E0AF38A6353F"
flyfishing,3c7gss,Dowhatnow30,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:29:17 2015 UTC,Orvis has a great video series for beginner fly fishing and casting that you can subscribe to via email. Also even tho you are casting correctly at 10 to 2/3 remember the tip  of the rod should remain relatively level and not fly in and arc. They explain it well in the Orvis videos. It does sound like most of your issues are due to casting.   Check this out: http://howtoflyfish.orvis.com/tests/basics-of-fly-fishing  The section about the importance of rod pauses and angles... Good luck man. Remember try to be patient. Check for wind-knots often and catch them early until you build confidence.

flyfishing,3c20rm,Cmt197,4,Sat Jul 4 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"I have not been to Westover Farms, however I have been to another private trout ranch in Missouri a bunch of times. These places keep their doors open by selling fish, not room rates. I am not saying that is a bad thing, its simply their business model. What that means to you is a heavily stocked stream with some of the dumbest fish you will ever encounter. I like to make a game of it and tie the worst looking flies and see just how much I can get away with. I am always surprised.  So, is it worth it for you? It depends on what your goal is. If you want to catch boat loads of fish without trying, these private trout farms are a good place. But, bring your check book because these places are catch and keep and they charge by the pound.   If you feel like you want to try one of these trout ranches, I really recommend Rockbridge, MO. Based upon your distance from Westover Farms, I would guess you live in the STL area, so that would be a 4 hour drive.   If you want a more cost effective, but still productive trips, try any one of the state run trout streams. They can get crowded, but once kids go back to school, it thins out."
flyfishing,3c20rm,sharpdressedman,2,Sat Jul 4 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. I haven't been to Westover either, but I've been Montauk frequently. It's a great, rustic park. If you're there on a weekday, it's not crowded at all. It's probably pretty high right now though with all the rain and runoff.  P.s. If you are in the STL area, you should check out the Ozark Fly Fishers club. They put on a ton of outings in MO and have a great time."
flyfishing,3c20rm,Wompum,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:56:37 2015 UTC,"I have been to Westover Farms four or five times. The fish are very easy to catch in places but since a majority of the property is catch and release, the fish can be wily.

flyfishing,3bwa3t,livesintrees3,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:54:50 2015 UTC,How long does does the Salmon fly hatch go on average? ill be there July 14 & 15. Any recommendations?
flyfishing,3bwa3t,jrbevis,2,Thu Jul 2 19:23:00 2015 UTC,By the 14th and 15th the hatch will be over. We will still be seeing some stones coming off for about a month but the fish should be keyed in on big bugs (hoppers/stones) weather depending. Just stop by the South Fork lodge near Conant boat ramp and talk shop with some of the dudes/gals.

flyfishing,3bw1jx,daaaaaaave,2,Thu Jul 2 16:49:48 2015 UTC,That's a fine looking rod. How long does something like this take to build?
flyfishing,3bw1jx,xxsoultonesxx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:57:20 2015 UTC,I can usually do one in a few days.  Epoxy cure times included.
flyfishing,3bw1jx,Xcelerator,2,Fri Jul 3 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"And I thought 4-pieces were the new thing! Jeez. I fished 2-pieces for years that were handed down to me by my Dad, and as I'm now starting to get my own new rods I am switching to 4-pieces of course.. being the general design of most manufactured rods these days. Never seen a 7-piece though. I am with /u/qGqGq , I am wondering what the benefits of a 7-piece are besides transportation"
flyfishing,3bw1jx,dullyouth,2,Thu Jul 2 19:23:30 2015 UTC,I am wondering what the benefits of a 7-piece are besides transportation   That's really the only benefit.
flyfishing,3bw1jx,Midnightlama,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:43:14 2015 UTC,This is correct.  More pieces are just easier to transport.  This one packs down to just over 16 inches total length.

flyfishing,3bw1jx,Methelsandriel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:08:21 2015 UTC,"Cool, never seen a rod with more than 5 pieces. What are the benefits of a 7 piece rod? I assume the goal is easier transport, but is there a tradeoff?"
flyfishing,3bw1jx,steest,2,Thu Jul 2 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"They usually market 7 piecers as travel roads. ""Put it in your briefcase on your next business day trip and fish at lunch.  Less pieces is generally considered a good thing. Ferrules subtly affect the action of the rod. A one piece rod has an unbroken spine and thus performs much more seamlessly."
flyfishing,3bw1jx,zrockstar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:42:26 2015 UTC,"The only benefit would be that it packs down to 16 inches total length.  I suppose the trade off would be slightly more weight due to the extra ferrule material.  Hold it next to a factory rod of the same specs made from high modulus graphite, and this 7 piece is actually lighter than most.  I use single foot guides which cut the epoxy/thread wrap weight in half."
flyfishing,3bw1jx,Snapitlikeabullwhip,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:34:41 2015 UTC,"Cool. A 16 inch packing size is a definite benefit, and I wouldn't mind a slightly heavier rod.   Thanks for taking the time to reply, and keep up the good work!"

flyfishing,3bwct7,SirTrout,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:30:03 2015 UTC,I would lean towards a 7 or 8 wt.   Bass flies can be big and would be easier to cast with a bigger rod.

I mainly use it for bass and occasionally take it trout fishing. I've been pretty satisfied with it as a starter option. Only thing with the 5wt is you may have trouble casting the bigger bass flies depending on your casting ability."

This is fabulous brook trout water. Typical fly fishing techniques apply. Also, You can rent canoes to do this stretch, you'd have a great time.  Downstream from 2 (north) is brown town. These stretches get insane dry fly hatches it sounds like. Ive run into guys when im fishing steel who dont even fish in the spring or the fall they just wait until summer and absolutely destroy on big Hex dries, etc.   Id call the Great lakes fly shop and ask about specific patterns, but any big may fly should do the trick. 4 wt floater will be good for dries and nymphs and if you want to throw streamers into the holes use the 6wt."

Aside from a trip upstream to big lake, I saw little to no fish activity which is a bad sign. If you catch anything, you might need to work it (the specimen in question) pretty hard.

flyfishing,3blu9q,databalata,8,Tue Jun 30 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"Was also wearing Orvis Silver Label waders and hiking up a remote section of a small river in CO. Had two friends with me, but they were both fishing well ahead and we hadn't seen eachother in a couple hours. Just like OP, I got to a spot with a steep cliff on my side of the river, and the pool below was too deep to cross, so my options were either scale a short-but-steep incline or walk back downstream to spot where I could cross. I took the first option. Everything was going well until, just before the top, one of my felt boots slipped out from underneath me and I started sliding toward the water. It all happened pretty fast from there. I hit the water feet-first, and being over 6 feet tall I expected to be able to stand up, but the water rushing into my waders (wading belts only do so much) and the force of the current on my chest pushed me backward and I went under. I vividly remember the bubbles rising away from me toward the surface as time seemed to slow down, and the only thought I had other than ""oh shit"" was this overwhelming sense of regret that I ended up drowning while fishing just like mom had warned me about, even though this river was barely flowing at 100cfs.  I'm honestly not sure what happened next. I remember getting pummeled by something under the water, which I suspect was part of a fallen tree with broken branches that ripped my shirt and cut me up. The next thing I know, I'm holding onto a rock about 100 yards downstream and gasping for air. Actually had to remove my waders since I couldn't crawl up on the bank with them full of water. It was oddly reminiscent of an emerging Caddis fly. I've done a lot of dumb shit since that day, but I've never lost my respect for the power and potential danger of even the smallest rivers."

flyfishing,3bl8pt,SavingPrivateMe,2,Tue Jun 30 03:19:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll give it a go.  As far as set up, I'd definitely say go with a full on kit from Cabelas (instead of piecing  separate parts) if that's where you're looking ('full on kit' meaning one of their rod/reel/line combos). I would argue w anyone that in a $150-$250 price point for a combo kit, you are going to get relatively similar quality gear that will perform very well (especially with the size of the fish you are targeting) and carry similar warranty/coverage for incidental breaks/damages.. (Echo/Redington have great gear at those price points as well as the Cabelas models, as an FYI)  For the questions:  *You got it. Backing attached to reel, then it attaches to the fly line, which then attaches to the leader, and then to your tippet. Your leader has tippet attached to the end of it so a fly can be tied right onto the end of your leader. After lost flies, changed flies, etc, the tapered leader will start to be very thick at the end (which will affect casting and drag) so you start adding tippet to keep the end of the leader thin. Some guys will attach tippet right away to even new leader (Always same size or smaller!!), some will tie on a tippet ring and attach tippet from there right away, etc etc. Personal preference there.   The smaller the number of the leader (ie: 9' 5x leader) the thicker the end. So a 4x would be thicker (better for wet flies/nymphing) than say, a 7x much thinner (more dry fly). But again, you can really buy any leader in that wheel-house and change the tippet below it (so long as you're progressing smaller and not bigger-- no 9' 6x leader that you then tie 4x tippet to).   *As for what else, that really depends on what you have from spin fishing. Waders, net, vest or pack, fly boxes, nippers, hemostats, dry fly powder/good/cloth, tippet spool, are a few that come to mind.   Hope this helps some?!"

flyfishing,3bl8pt,EuroNymphGuy,2,Tue Jun 30 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"I have both rods. I'm going to give you a brief overview of both and from there you can pick what would suit you best.   Reddington CT   The CT is a bit soft, it's actually my favorite rod to fish - but it's a short distance, small fly, small water, small fish rod (at least the 3wt is, the 5wt may be different, but I would guess you're not going to be whipping out huge long casts with the CT, especially as a beginner). The CT is cheap - but it's probably the best rod for the price on the market right now. If you go with the CT, you have to find a reel and line to match. For smaller fish, as you said you were going to be fishing for, the reel truly does not matter. You will probably never put a fish on your reel. Say you pick the CT. It's $100 right now, I have seen it as low as $80, but it's very regularly $90. $90 + $50 is what I would budget for the rod + the reel. Find something used or a small cheap reel from a store - again, the reel will not matter much.  The line, however, will matter a lot more. There are a million choices, but you want something, and this is going to be confusing to a beginner, with a longer front taper and you want it in exactly a 5wt. Many lines now days, like SA GPX and Rio Gold, two of the major fly line companies' flagships, are actually half a weight heavier than advertised. So a 5wt line is actually the weight of a 5.5wt. It's called ""overlining,"" and some rods and situations actually call for a full line or more of overlining. The same can be done the opposite way. This speeds up (overlining) or slows down (underlining) a rod's casting. The CT is already a ""slower"" rod in today's market, an dI wouldn't want to slow it down much more unless you're doing very delicate presentation of dries. Find a ""spooled but never used"" fly line on the forums somewhere (Facebook, North American Fly Fishign Forum, ect). You'll find a decent level line, like $50+ originally, for $25-35. Feel free to PM me if you're still confused about exactly what line to get.   The RLS+   This was my first rod and reel. I still use it a lot, in fact it's probably used most times I go to the river, either by me or someone who is with me. It's a good rod for the money, not great. The reel however is fantastic. The reel on the RLS+ is great for the money, but like I already said, you don't need a good reel for small fish. It's a faster rod, a more modern action, than the CT. The line with the RLS+ is crap. I would recommend replacing it as soon as you get it.   For the CT you'll have to buy backing. For the RLS you won't.  You're right about how the line is normally set up. It's backing to fly line to leader to tippet. Now, this has some insane variations and nuances for situational fishing, but for now all you need to know is that the leader attaches to the tippet, which attaches to the fly.  The leader tapers from thick to thin. Thick attaches to the fly line, thin to the tippet. This is the confusing part! The leader will taper into a tippet size! So if you buy a leader and it's a ""5x"" leader, the bottom of the leader will be 5x tippet size for maybe a foot and a half of a 9ft leader. Normally people use at least some of the tippet size from the leader directly before adding extra tippet. So if you buy a 9ft 5x leader, which is about standard for trout fishing, you don't want to add two feet of tippet directly to the leader. That would make it 11ft long. Use up some of the leader before tying tippet on. Once you have tied tippet on once, use it up, tying flies onto it, until it is short enough to replace, in which case you cut the knot from the leader and tie a new 2-3ft of tippet on (however much is best for casting and the situation).  I would say for small fish 4-6x tippet should be fine. 5x is like the golden standard.  Let me know if you have more questions."
flyfishing,3bl8pt,weatherwar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:27:56 2015 UTC,"Just curious what line you are running on your 3wt CT? I have tried a couple and have just never enjoyed the feel of that rod. Mine broke relatively easy the last time I was out, and it was only the third or fourth time I used it, so I wonder if there was just something wrong with the construction of mine, or if I need to try yet another line."
flyfishing,3bl8pt,zrockstar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:09:39 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a construction issue.  The line really shouldn't matter that much, but I'm running with the Allen Compass line. IMHO it's just a cheap Chinese made line that I could have got on eBay for $10, but whatever. It was actually worth it because my first line was their ATS line, which might be gone now, and I actually broke the line. I didn't know it was possible to do that, but it kind of proves the cheap chinese thing - anywho, they replaced it for me so that was nice of them. Still wouldn't recommend it."
flyfishing,3bl8pt,weatherwar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:29:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you could be right. Read review after review of how nice the CT cast for the money, but mine just never felt right.

flyfishing,3bl8pt,zrockstar,2,Wed Jul 1 13:21:11 2015 UTC,"No offense OP, but if you are this inexperienced at fly-fishing, reading FAQs and Reddit comments is only going to take you so far. Everyone is going to have a different opinion, and it's going to be impossible for you to distinguish what would work best for you and what wouldn't at this point. Instead of trying to ""tackle"" this all yourself (couldn't resist) why don't you seek out a local fly-fishing club whose members can help get you started with some real hands-on experience? Go out with someone and cast their setup. See how their line-leader-tippet is rigged. Watch their casting stroke from a distance. I just think you'll get FAR more out of one single day on the water than you will talking to people online. If you didn't live 1,500 miles away I would offer to take you out myself."
flyfishing,3bl8pt,FLORI_DUH,2,Wed Jul 1 13:09:31 2015 UTC,"I agree. Getting out to a local shop to get some hand's on experience is a fantastic way to learn.   I will have to disagree, just a bit, in what OP can gain from the info on the sidebar and some of the info he's gonna grab from the sub members and their ideas. The sidebar is chock full of useful information because it's the advice given by fisherman of all different levels and skills many times over! Questions about leaders, waders, starter rods, etc have been asked hundreds of times over with similar recommendations and advice given from all walks of our sport (which prompted the sidebar posts)!"
flyfishing,3bl8pt,dahuii22,2,Wed Jul 1 13:42:44 2015 UTC,"With regards to tippet and leaders, I'll cut off the last 3 feet of the leader and tie on a tippet ring. Then I'll tie the last 3 feet to that. I'll tie the fly on and keep  tying flies on until it gets too short or breaks off and then I'll tie on a new tippet. Hope that is helpful.   I use 6x florocarbon tippet for trout usually. If I have a larger fly I may beef up to like a 3x or 4x nylon tippet and I'll usually shorten my leader too so the bigger flies turn over better. If I'm going for bass or carp I use leaders intended for bass with a 15lb test saltwater tippet. Cause a flyshop dude sold me on it.   Anyway, hope that was helpful. I'll shut up now."

flyfishing,3bkfms,gobbler87,3,Mon Jun 29 23:12:30 2015 UTC,"A few quick things:   You do a lot of false casts.  If you can get the line out with fewer false casts, you can spend more time fishing and you won't tire yourself out. You probably didn't need to get a fish that small onto the reel, but that doesn't really matter so much. If you can get the hook out while leaving the fish in the net and still in the water, it's better for the fish.  You didn't really have it out of the water for too long though, and with a fish that small it will recover quickly and be fine.   Hope that was helpful in some way."

flyfishing,3bkfms,Pastor_Bill,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"If you're only getting a few feet of line out, the answer is practice.  The more you cast the better you'll get.  You clearly know the basics, perfecting it will just take time.  There's no magic fix, just something to work on.  By ""on the reel"" I mean that with a fish of that size you can play it just by stripping in line, you don't have to crank it in with the reel.  Again, this doesn't really matter, you can do whatever works for you."

flyfishing,3bkfms,mattsfishingfortrout,2,Tue Jun 30 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"What's the action of the rod you are using, looks slow to medium. Maybe start out with lot more line to begin with, and minimize false casting.  Also I don't think you are giving it proper stop on backcast. A good sudden stop on backcast should also help get some of that line out.  Re: playing fish on the reel, trout so small, you can just pull the line in with your hand and bring it in, no need to reel it in all the way."

flyfishing,3bgpb9,regulusss,2,Mon Jun 29 01:54:24 2015 UTC,Line management before the strike is the most important thing when setting the hook. If you have a poor cast and your leader or fly line has a lot of slack in it you will never be able to react fast enough to hook a fish before he spits your fly.   When you 'set' the hook don't think about a hook set like you would use for bass. All you are trying to do is put tension on the line. Lift the rod quickly but deliberately until you feel the fish. At this point he should be pretty much hooked. If you miss a fish the fly should not end up behind you. If it does you are striking too hard.
flyfishing,3bgpb9,Kiernanstrat,2,Mon Jun 29 16:37:23 2015 UTC,Thank you this makes sense. Just need to not pull like insane person
flyfishing,3bgpb9,Kiernanstrat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:29:05 2015 UTC,Learning to react to a strike is a difficult skill to get the hang of. The real issue is you can't practice like you can when learning to cast. You really have to use live fish. If you are really having a hard time (I did) try to find a pond with some sunfish in it. They are more than willing to cooperate and you can really focus on learning the muscle memory you need to consistently set the hook.

If he sees ANYTHING wrong with your presentation or event the fly itself, he won't bite.  I only ask that you PLEASE practice catch and release here.  This was my favorite place to fish when I lived in New England.  It's a very quiet spot, and semi-unknown.  You'll see a few locals every now and then, but they have real trouble getting to the good spots.  Fly fishing paradise :)  Tight lines man."

If this kind sir wants to gift me the knowledge of one mr.bob the brown then i will use this knowledge to the best of my ability. I will even leave the 4 wt at home because i wouldnt want to put unnecassary strain on such an amazing fish. This is just the info i needed whether it's legit or not doesnt matter.

flyfishing,3befwt,bigmac22077,2,Sun Jun 28 13:38:55 2015 UTC,I have yet to have a streamer work for me on this river. any recommendations?
flyfishing,3befwt,atfarley,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"i dont really have much luck either, maybe 1 fish in 5 days i try to use them. but with these 2 i was using a foxtail leech and throwing it in front of a rock with a deep pool and just letting it drift past without retrieving at all, they seemed to like that."
flyfishing,3betm9,timarland,7,Sun Jun 28 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"I prefer to simply tie a length of tippet around the bend of the hook (improved clinch) of the first fly, and then tie the dropper to that tippet.  I'm sure the technique in that video would work just fine, but I like the idea of my flies being in-line as opposed to two separate tag ends.  I feel like that keeps tangles to a minimum while casting.  However, with any multi-fly rig, I expect a bit more line twist and tangles regardless."
flyfishing,3betm9,Keeeney,2,Sun Jun 28 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"I use the Orvis non-slip loop quite a bit on my bottom fly for improved movement, especially in stillwater situations. Otherwise I'm just using a regular clinch knot to the eye of the hook.    When fishing actual nymphs (not midges in a lake), I like to tie my dropper on off of the eye of the hook, so the nymph is (hopefully) sitting horizontally in the water column instead of tying to the hook bend and having the fly drifting vertically.  I've noticed improved interest in the fly as well as improved hook-ups.  Always use the lightest Flurocarbon leader/tippet you can get away with to get the best drag free drift possible."
flyfishing,3betm9,daaaaaaave,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:25:35 2015 UTC,"I have yet to find a flouro that doesn't have a big tendency to curl up on me, leading to more tangles in these types of rigs.  However, I absolutely agree with the horizontal drift.  Thus the question, and thus my interest in getting a straight away tag end for each fly in the rig."
flyfishing,3betm9,daaaaaaave,2,Sun Jun 28 20:06:54 2015 UTC,"I actually find Fluro to be stiffer than Mono.  I haven't noticed any curling??  Maybe you got a bad spool or something?  I prefer it for all of my nymphing since it sinks and doesn't reflect light.    If mono is working for you, by all means stick with it.  The same holds true though.  Use the smallest possible diameter that you can get away with for better, drag free drifts."
flyfishing,3betm9,_iFish,3,Sun Jun 28 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"Triple Surgeon's using either the top or bottom tag is the way to go for double nymph rigs. Always always always use the same size tippet for dropper tags and always wet and check your knots.   Tying around the hook bend is alright for dry dropper, but will hamper your flies movements and create weak points.   Source: I like nymphs."
flyfishing,3betm9,_iFish,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:55:31 2015 UTC,"So pardon my relative knot identification dumbassness, but that youtbube video I linked to is essentially a surgeon's knot using the tag, no?    I wouldn't think of using different sized tippet - that's for psychos.  I like dries better, I must admit, but my son and fish seem to like nymphs on a more consistent basis..."
flyfishing,3betm9,dahuii22,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.   Generally a surgeon's knot would be connecting the main line and the line going to the point fly (his stone fly). He does basically the same thing but uses a small short section of line for it. Will it work? Yea. Is it as strong? Not really, but the difference is marginal.   I always tie in at least one tag as I'm always fishing at least 2 flies so I never run into this problem. Also, when I want to add a fly, I'm always elongating my tippet section, not keeping it the same."

flyfishing,3bciyu,AlmightyApkallu,2,Sun Jun 28 15:48:02 2015 UTC,"Second the Cimarron recommend though the rains have shut it down for a while.  I'm not sure how much exploring in the Jemez watershed you have done but there is a ton up there.   The San Antonio and the east fork of the Jemez river offer a lot of water to explore.   I'm gonna give up one of my secret spots here so I may earn some hate from the Jemez guys.   Drive west on Highway 126 from La Cueva until you pass the San Antonio campground on your left. Immediately after on your right is a parking area for a few cars and a gated forest service road 132, park here and walk up the forest service road until you begin to see ominous trespassing signs, stay on the road itself and you will not be trespassing, though you appear to be walking through a person's property, the forest service road bisected it. Continue past until the road starts to climb away from the river and you can fish the canyon there for at least three to four miles almost assuredly alone.   Alternatively you can fish the upper section of the San Antonio by continuing on Highway 126 until you see forest service road 376 on your right, follow it up and after approximately 2 miles you will see a road on your right that has been fenced off and bulldozers have plowed big berms to prevent driving.   You can fish that Meadow Valley from the fence at the northern sectikn all the way down to the mouth of the canyon where private property begins.   Other than that you have all of northern new mexico to explore. The Pecos rivershed above the town of Pecos The red River, and it's confluence with the Rio Grande the Rio Grande Gorge in early spring and throughout the fall, the Chama, and the Brazos, Costilla Creek, small streams galore near Taos, the list goes on.  I don't know much about souther new mexico though I have done some backpacking in the black range and in southeastern Arizona and if you can find a stream that runs all year chances are there are trout there."

Pocket sized, super-fast autofocus which is especially important for trout if you don't want to keep them out of the water too long, really big sensor size, really easy to use, just a fantastic camera all around.  There are a bunch of great pocket-sized cameras that will give you fantastic photos as well though, I just happen to have fallen in love with the Ricoh.  To keep it dry, I use a very complex rig which involves storing the camera in my shirt pocket and looping the lanyard through my top buttonhole."

I owe a lot of my development as a fisherman to the tips and techniques I learned from this very sub-reddit, so hopefully this collection goes some way to repaying that debt!  By way of sneaky cross-promotion, I've started a blog where I go into some over-the-top detail about the stories behind the pictures.

flyfishing,3b5gab,Jankow1064,8,Fri Jun 26 03:08:01 2015 UTC,"Fly tying, I find, is what separates fly fishing from other methods - it is a whole new level of involvement in the sport.  Fishing becomes a lot more enjoyable when you are fishing (and catching fish on) the flies you have tied.    Make each wrap with confidence, and try limiting yourself to the numbers of wraps used to tie in each material.  If you use thread deliberately, your flies will reflect that.  Also, if you haven't already, try watching Davie McPhail's videos on YouTube.  He has some fantastic tutorials, and you can learn a new technique from each one  Happy tying dude!"
flyfishing,3b5gab,Coastty,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:39:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! As im trying my second fly, brown drake, im noticing that im using a lot of thread. Ill check him out for sure."
flyfishing,3b5gab,el__duderino,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:52:23 2015 UTC,"That is pretty standard. Over time you'll find the limits.  After a few for fun find a fly you want to tie and try to learn how to tie it well - as close to the example as possible.   Take your time, speed will come with time.   If you can appreciate and enjoy that process then you will find many happy hours behind a vice."
flyfishing,3b5gab,dahuii22,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:38:19 2015 UTC,"This guy right here. Tie some fun flies and mess around. But when it's time to get serious, pick one pattern and lock in.

flyfishing,3b3e8c,vision-quest,2,Fri Jun 26 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, The Park has been fishing fantastic with run off on the decline. If your looking for moving water; head towards Moraine Valley/Glacier creek. Fish with 2bit hookers(red), San Juan Worms, and Pheasant Tails. Also the streamer bite in Moraine has been off the charts.   For still water, head towards the Loch/Thunder Lake, Lost Lake, and Jasper for the best high country lakes have to offer. Anything that is 10,000 ft and below is free of ice. We hiked up into Ouzel Lake and it was a complete bust : (. For the lakes, throw Griffiths gnats, Sprout Midges, Adams in size 20 and up have been most productive. Best of luck! Hope this helps.

flyfishing,3b4d8n,CampBenCh,2,Fri Jun 26 04:55:34 2015 UTC,"Totally different. The Letort (and Big Spring) are tough because the fish know you are there way before you ever see them.

flyfishing,3b426x,shallowcreeks,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:13:24 2015 UTC,What I would do is tie up a few really simple leaders. Get a spool of 20lb Mason Hard Mono and some barrel swivels. Use the 20lb mason to connect to the fly line then tie in a barrel swivel. From there use some 60lb flurocarbon and tie your fly on with your favorite loop knot. Wire has a tendency to scare away some fish. You may get some bigger pike that may chew through the 60lb but that rarely happens in my experience
flyfishing,3b426x,CPFlyFisherman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:15:29 2015 UTC,I use wire tippet and a standard single loop.  They still tear up wire tippet after catching a couple of them.  Occasionally lose one but very rarely.

flyfishing,3b426x,darmniel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:31:20 2015 UTC,I use 6ft of 20lb test with perfection loops in each end then a wire leader.

flyfishing,3b2g0c,francisjoe,5,Thu Jun 25 12:48:10 2015 UTC,"I have a reel with a similar wobble.  I haven't noticed issues with the drag, but I really don't use it much. The biggest issue I've had is the line slipping between the spool and the reel body and getting tangled. It's certainly usable, but if you just bought it I would try to get it replaced/return it."
flyfishing,3b2g0c,qGqGq,2,Thu Jun 25 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"Unlikely you will ever really need the drag, unless you catch a huge fish in really fast current and you are unable to stop the reel by palming it.   That said, a wobble or other defect is annoying when reeling line back onto the reel.   Is the spool bent, or is the line guard catching the spool at an angle? Figure out what the issue is and you may be able to tweak something manually.   The easier thing might just be to take it back to Orvis. They have a fantastic return policy. Many people take advantage of it to no end, but their company policy is to stand behind their products 100%. I would call them and explain the issue and they will tell you your options.   I would bet you have an older version of the Battenkill disc drag reel, which they don't make anymore. They will probably give you store credit towards a new reel.   Much easier to get what you want rather than dealing with the ebay seller. Although I would alert him and address that issue separately."

What I did not see in any of that was where you learned how to cast and where/how to catch the fish.... Forgive me if that sounds horrible, but hear me out. There may be issues with where you're casting and how you're casting/presenting. By no means do I know all of the ins and outs of casting/presentation, especially while fly fishing, but that is the direction I would point you in based on the information provided. My general method is to find a small ripple or narrow section and let my lure drift through there and out the back side. It is a very basic technique that has worked for me a bit.   Aside from that, find a fly-fishing group to meet up with. It sounds like you're in a great area for it. Look on facebook, craigslist, or local tackle shops to find a group that meets up to fish and learn. You might be able to join up with them and essentially get a guide for a couple hours for free.   I learned a lot from a guy that teaches a wounded warrior group when I met up with him at a local stream. He talked to me for 15 minutes and I gathered enough from him about my technique to get me a solid idea of what I was doing."
flyfishing,3b439p,WheelsAndGears,3,Thu Jun 25 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"This. So many times, this."
flyfishing,3b439p,fireeight,5,Thu Jun 25 22:52:28 2015 UTC,"Ok. So this may get a bit meta and for that I apologize out front. But here goes.  Stop. Just stop. Seriously. You need to.   Take a step back. A deep breath. Regroup. And listen to the great advice above (or below, who knows where this lands with the crazy world of reddit in which we all live..).  Another preface. I get angry too. I'm not some tree-hugging, bark chewing, dread-rocking native. I love to fly fish. And goddammit I love to catch fish!   But fly fishing (to most all of us) is not about catching fish every time we go fishing. And I know you've heard that before. And I know it doesn't make your current situation much better. But it's the truth. And the sooner you grasp that, the more sane you'll become!   Fly fishing, in my opinion, is nowhere near as simple as using the spinning rig I grew up with. I've fished countless times and caught zero fish when I know I could have with some power bait, a worm, or a salmon egg. But that's the reason I'm fly fishing. I want that challenge. I would not be fly fishing to feed my family. I play this game, our game, to challenge myself and my skills. I know I'm lowering my catch rate in doing so, and I'm OK with that. It makes the success of landing a trout so much more meaningful.  To me, I grew up with trout on a pedestal. I was taught early on that they were smart. They were finicky. They were picky to the size of their food, the color, the scent. Making myself very sure as to whether or not they could see my hook, keeping my line was as thin as humanly possibly to hide it in the water. What color clothes am I wearing, are they too bright? Where's my shadow? How much noise and vibration am I making as I move through the water?  Did you get all that? Is all of that in your mind as you hit the water? Of course not. That's a tough checklist to always go through. But it's necessary. And important. More so in heavily fished and traveled waters. Stop beating yourself up for something we all go through! For every one of these beautiful fish pics we all post, ask how many days, weeks, months, some of us have gone 'trout hungry' before that catch. I think you'd be surprised!  I'm not the brightest tool in the shed (get all that??) but here's what I do know. Stick with it. Life's short. For real. Take a step back and a deep breath. Think about what's important in life. I mean really important. And you cannot forget about the joy being in nature and on the water brings you! With or without fish. The trout will come. Trust me. Trust us. They will. But not without time. And effort. And practice. Don't cast harder, faster, full of angst.   Slow down. Breath deep. And enjoy. The trout are there waiting for you."

This year so far I've landed 3 trout, all pretty sizable (and beautiful), hooked several more but didn't land them.   The most helpful thing for me was going with somebody else. I suggest a guide or a friend that you can observe and ask questions.   It's seriously a game changer, because flyfishing is a bit more involved. Not more difficult, per se, but there's a lot of nuances that you don't necessarily find in the cut-and-dry spinning or bait fishing. A lot of it is just choosing the right spot, not even just the right pull-off or right river, but the right spots in the water itself."
flyfishing,3b439p,Coneyestates,3,Fri Jun 26 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe if you have a lake that get planted/stocked with trout, go practice there. Fly selection and matching is a must.

They actually stock the streams in these mountains with rainbows, but they also have just about every other species of trout in them as well.   There are local fishing reports here, several that tell what fish are biting and each little stream. I usually go up there with the whole slew of them. I don't know what a guide could tell me out on the stream that the report or local shops tell me about fishing up there in the past few days and what's biting."

Lined front pouch pocket to warm your hands. D-Ring on the back to hang your net. They have a double loop on the front to store some gadgets. The suspenders are padded and joined by neoprene in the back to make one attachment on the back side. They have More layers of material on the upper and lower parts of the waders. They also fit really nice. The waist is a bit lower than previous pairs so they wear more like pants. They are crazy comfy and durable. I am hard on my gear and they haven't yet given me a problem.

flyfishing,3azpa6,Blackout356,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:05:23 2015 UTC,my waders have gravel guards. My problem with them is that they are made out of the same material as the waders themselves. I would like to see other brands besides simms use neopreen gaurds. If simms does not have a patent on neopreen attached gaurds then Orvis and Patagonia should replace the systems they are using for a neopreen gravel gaurd system.

flyfishing,3atyvd,ms144658,3,Tue Jun 23 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"On this thread, I'm from Washington too, and am getting an MS in fisheries science.  It's true that dollies and bullies are almost indistinguishable from one another, but do overlap in Washington and BC.  There are important differences from one another regarding their relative conservation status and regional protections, so it's worth having a decent idea of the species you are targeting.  Both can be anadromous, with bullies tending to be more prone to residency in most of their range relative to dollies.  The essential characteristics of bull trout habitat are cold, clean, connected, and complex rather than low elevation slow moving systems.  So just about anything with a complex ecosystem (read Wilderness) could be characterized as bully habitat in Western Washington and coastal BC.  All this said, by no means are we trying to take away from your fish streamdrunk8, just worth bringing up for discussion.  It's a good fish no matter the species."
flyfishing,3atyvd,ms144658,2,Tue Jun 23 21:34:21 2015 UTC,"Washington State here. You're correct in thinking that fish is most likely a bull trout. From what I've learned, the dolly varden in Wa and BC are generally smaller and occupy the very upper stretches of river systems. The bull trout are bigger, occupy the entire river system and some make forays into the ocean where they get huge. Honestly though, it's just a name. Even biologists can't tell the difference between the two by using appearance. Also, the further north you get the more prevalent dolly varden get and vice versa for bull trout. Either way, nice fish man."

flyfishing,3avwyd,Misanthraloper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:41:46 2015 UTC,"The big thing that I can see with these rods is that they collapse down to a very short length so they can be used when backpacking into remote areas, or kept in a trunk/motorcycle bag easily. But, I have seen regular fly rods that do that too.   I was interested in it because of the simplicity, but it does seem to be kind of a hipster thing to do. The sport seems to help develop more skills of approach and techniques, because you don't have the advantage of being able to cast as far and use different gear. You can also use incredibly light gear with this, but you're limited to lighter gear than with traditional fly rods.   In the end, there is good and bad to it. It is a neat thing to learn, but I don't think I am sinking a couple hundred dollars into it."
flyfishing,3avwyd,atfarley,3,Wed Jun 24 00:01:59 2015 UTC,I also like the complexity of modern fly fishing. I am always learning and improving on different systems.

flyfishing,3aw6jz,Infinitell,5,Wed Jun 24 00:07:34 2015 UTC,"Okay so I don't really understand exactly what you're asking so I'll just explain everything  The line setup goes like this for a basic, 1 fly rig. Reel>Fly line>Leader>Tippet>Fly.   Most leaders should have a taper to them, as in one side should be thicker than the other. You should tie the thicker side to the fly line, and the thinner side to the tippet. Leaders come in many shapes and sizes but the preferred type for your first leaders is a knotless leader (ie one strand of monofilament with a taper, not several strands of level (taper-less) monofilaments tied together. The tippet section should be tied to the leader and also to the fly. For a 7ft leader and a standard 8-9ft fly rod, I'd suggest a 2-3ft section of tippet material.   Many say tippet is optional, however for learning I highly recommend it. All experienced fly fisherman I know use a tippet material of some type. Many will also say a leader is not necessary, and a ~7ft section of heavier line is all you need. I highly disagree and would only experiment with leaders after you have learned to cast. Making your own leaders is a huge step in your fly fishing experience, and should only be done after you've mastered the basic's. Heed me on this, a bad leader will make learning a LOT tougher on you.   For changing flies, you should cut the fly off the end of the tippet (so only a couple of mm's/fraction of an inch of your line should be cut off). You will only ever need to cut the leader from the fly line when you need to change leaders, which is usually an uncommon occurance for most fisherman. Say, one in every 5-10 times you go fishing. There is no rule as to when. When it goes you'll know, or you may want to try a new leader.   For more questions, I'd highly recommend checking this link out, as well as perusing our side bar for tips"
flyfishing,3aw6jz,_iFish,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:25:10 2015 UTC,"The short answer is, ""Yes, attach the entire leader to the line.""  As mentioned, you may need to attach additional line to that leader, with that being called tippet.  There are many knots for doing that, and one I use frequently is the blood knot.    The second question...you simply remove just the fly, and replace it with whatever pattern you're going to try next.    Good luck with everything, and hopefully you can find someone in your area to help give you a few additional pointers."
flyfishing,3aw6jz,TimCammisa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:31:39 2015 UTC,thanks for the answer. I also read that tippet is attached after your leader has gotten a bit short and thick so you put the tippet on. Is this what it's for?
flyfishing,3aw6jz,everyyearis03,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"the leader is the gradation from line to fly. getting thinner and thinner. depending on water conditions, what you're fishing with and what you're fishing for, as well as where you are fishing, dictates your tippet and leader. you have to remember that you are fishing with a fly... not a lure and need the fish to ignore the fact that a huge shadow just snaked over the water pulling the fly around..."
flyfishing,3aw6jz,_iFish,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:41:46 2015 UTC,"Short answer - yes. Store bought leaders already have a tippet section, tippet is replacing that after you've changed flies so many times. When the leader is cut back that it starts getting thicker, start using tippet.   Long answer - see everyyearis03's answer"

flyfishing,3aw6jz,RoverLife,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:24:36 2015 UTC,It's not. Most peoples leaders are longer than the rod itself.
flyfishing,3aw6jz,_iFish,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:40:26 2015 UTC,Some people use up to 13 foot leaders when the fish are ultra skittish. 7 would only be considered too long for pike fishing or the like

The park is about an hour and a half from Puerto Natales, so you might want to rent a car while your there and explore the park freely. The are plenty of lakes and rivers in the area with great fishing overall. Professional guides are plentiful but they might be a bit expensive. The park has a number of guides that will help you at the parks tourist information centers. The trekking circuits are an unforgettable experience. Be prepared for cold and lots of wind. I'd go visit Punta Arenas and Tierra del Fuego (great fishing too) if I have the time. Good Luck and enjoy Chile :)"

Most of it follows the road and is public and fishable. A few flat, featureless stretches but mostly pretty good. There are also 12 camp sites from Warren Bridge that is just north of Daniel. Turn East off the highway and follow the gravel road to an open site or decent water. Both places are accessible and will fish great. Good luck, post pictures."

flyfishing,3aq8rk,steamdrunk8,8,Mon Jun 22 16:59:37 2015 UTC,Some details about the rod I posted earlier. I had Lost my 4 wt because the bottom of my rod tube I had strapped to my bag ripped during some heavy bush waking we had to do to get out of a pool we had hiked to. I didn't realize this till 5 the next morning when we planned to start fishing. I did go back and try to trace our steps but found nothing. Driving back to meet my friends trying to figure out what I was going to do for the next 2 days with no rod I spotted some bamboo poles that were strapped to a bridge for signage that had long been taken down. So I Thought why not try? I pulled over and grabbed one.took it back to the lake where I began trying to split it. I got two decent halves but the split had wandered leaving me with one side much thicker then the other so I used that. Taking the piece I split it one more time but only about halfway down the length because it began to wander again. I then luckily had the tip of the rod I had lost in my bag with a single eyelet on it which I stuck between the split on the end then wrapped it tight with some heavy leader I had. I continued this wrap the full length and then used it to lash my reel to the curved side. After that I used para cord to make a handle and secure the reel further and some band aids at the tip to keep the line from spooling off. Once assembled it worked surprisingly well. Due to only the top half of the rod being split a second time it had abit of a slingshot action on the back cast. Which actually worked to my advantage and I could cast it as far as my 4 wt. all in all it turned out being a wicked weekend with the boys. I guess the lesson here is to never let anything stand in your way when it comes to flyfishing! Cheers guys.

flyfishing,3arwfd,down_view,2,Tue Jun 23 00:39:06 2015 UTC,"I'm prepping for a week long trip down to the Davidson, so some terrestrials are on the menu. I decided to tie up some Ant Acids, a fly by Kelly Galloup.  I wanted some other than the standard foam ant and thought these looked good. Plus I could watch Kelly tie all day...just the amount of knowledge he drops in his videos.   After tying a decent looking one, I had the idea to see how the fly looks to the fish. My real curiosity was how visible the three, segmented bodies were. So I took my GoPro and put it in a clear dish filled with water and then took video of the fly on the water. I ran into the problem with the camera not wanting to focus on the fly (anyone know how to fix that?), but figured maybe this is how things look from below in a stream with any real gradient to it, so I wasn't super concerned.   I think the body is generally impressionistic of a large ant. The legs look okay, if a bit stiff and the deer hair is a necessary evil for floatation. Overall I think this pattern is going to meet the criteria for a lot of search images and catch some fish.   If anyone has done this before and has any tips on how to get the camera to get and stay focused, I'd appreciate it."

flyfishing,3as2x9,saladstudent,4,Tue Jun 23 01:37:19 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, there aren't too many opportunities this time off year for brookies around Acadia.  They stock all the lakes and ponds in the park, but the trout will be down deep and hard to target with a fly rod.  If you are willing to drive a few hours, then you'll be in business. Baxter State Park is not only one of the most beautiful places in the country, but also has legendary stillwater brookie fishing.  There is a lot of information out there for the region.  There are plenty of streams within an hour or two of Acadia that hold wild trout, but this is a case where you'll have to find them on your own.  We Mainers protect our honey holes, but I'm willing to bet you can find suitable habitat quite easily with Google Maps and a thermometer.  Taking Rt. 9 East out of Brewer would be a good move if you wanted to explore a little.  Native brookies aren't too picky; Any dry will do, and they don't necessarily have to be actively rising to take dries.  Stripping size 6 or 8 streamers can be deadly as well.  Since you'll be fishing in Maine, try one of Carrie Stevens' patterns.  Any baitfish imitator or even a stimulator pattern will work."

Definitely a great idea this time of year.  Make sure you fish the West Branch at least one full day. Landlocks of that quality, and the river itself, are something to behold."

flyfishing,3as2x9,rustyinco,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:16:16 2015 UTC,"Being a Maine native, I can say that we have some amazing, if not world-class fly fishing available. Unfortunately MDI isn't very close to any of them. As stated previously maybe the closest spot is maybe a couple of hours away in Baxter State Park. Check out the West Branch of the Penobscot river near baxter: http://www.maineriverguides.com/penobscot-river-fishing  Also in Eastern Maine is Grand Lake Stream: http://weatherbys.com/maine-fishing/fly-fishing-grand-lake ... My favorite spots are in my back yard on the other side of the state. The Rangeley Lakes region offers many different places for native/wild trophy sized brook trout and LL Salmon.   This is from last weekend on the Magalloway River: http://i.imgur.com/LyKJXZX.jpg  Good luck and tight lines."

flyfishing,3aqndv,EuroNymphGuy,6,Mon Jun 22 18:47:59 2015 UTC,"Feel very lucky. Water temp was good. Not much rain. Water was high, and so, the river wasn't that crowded.   Tightline nymphing was the way to go. Read prior posts from /u/dahuii22, /u/anacondatmz, /u/_ifish.   FWIW, some lessons learned here.  Edit: Fish was in the net in water most of the time and was never on the grass. Water was good depth right next to the bank. Raised the net slightly to take the photo."

flyfishing,3aqndv,VMProductionsGPK,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:26:44 2015 UTC,Have never fished that lake. I'd imagine you'd have to fish at dawn or dusk or fish very deep to get to cold water.
flyfishing,3aqndv,VMProductionsGPK,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"And, if you were referring to fishing the river itself, I've done it in August. Your tactic will depend on the water temp. (more here on why temperature really matters for trout) and levels then.   Benefit of the 1st CT dam is water comes from the bottom of the dam, so the water temp is usually still cold.  If shallow water, you'll have good luck with dry-droppers and dries. If high water, it will be about nymphing with tungsten. If water is warm, target the riffles, where water is highly oxygenated, or find a colder spot in the river where a tributary or underground water feeds into it. And, fish closer to the dam, where the water is cooler.  Honestly, I'd buy a cheap water thermometer and take readings along the river. You'll find cool spots and strike trout gold.  I've always had good luck there regardless of the river's conditions. I just try to be flexible on tactics. It's a truly special fishery.  Last, be sure to check the fishing reports at Tall Timber and Lopstick.   Hope that helps.  Edit: fixed grammar, added links."

flyfishing,3aromk,Juddernaut,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:31:56 2015 UTC,Yeah it's rare that I can offer such direct advice! But the drag is smoother and the overall build is a lot more solid. I dropped the wind river reel from like 2 feet onto my laminate floor and cracked a piece off the reel seat part. No way that would happen to the prestige.
flyfishing,3aromk,zrockstar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:34:39 2015 UTC,"The Wind River reel is horrible. It is so heavy and super wide. I got one for a 4 wt and went to find a reel bag since it didn't come with one and had to get one made for a saltwater reel just to get it inside the case. When I finally put it on my rod, it was so heavy it totally threw the balance of the setup and I felt like the whole bottom of the rod was swinging out from under me due to the weight. Needless to say I returned it. I paid under $20 for it and couldn't even justify keeping it at that price."
flyfishing,3aromk,CarbonWeAre,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:31:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry so much about your gear if I were you. If you are just learning, what equipment you have isn't going to make much difference; and as long as you aren't fishing for pike or saltwater fish, the reel is just a line storage device and the drag is irrelevant. Get whatever you can afford and learn on that. Worry about more expensive gear as you get deeper into the sport when the amount of time you spend doing it can justify spending more money."

flyfishing,3as65p,beer_engineer,2,Tue Jun 23 02:53:11 2015 UTC,"Not sure exactly what the reel is, but my guess is it will at least last you long enough to save up for something better.  I wouldn't bother with anything under the $100 range for a serious saltwater reel.  I'd look at $200 and over.  Wait until you can get to that point first, and just use what you have until then."
flyfishing,3as65p,BentRods,4,Tue Jun 23 03:33:36 2015 UTC,Look into lamson reels. They have a very well respected drag system that has kind of become the go to when looking for a more budget friendly reel yet not sacrificing quality or performance. I have a couple of Konic's and I love them. If I'm not mistaken you should be able to find them out there in the 150$ price range for 7-8wt.
flyfishing,3as65p,w12x40,2,Tue Jun 23 11:18:49 2015 UTC,"I'll second the Konic reels. I like them. They were on sale recently because they are discontinued. If you shop carefully, maybe you'll find them."

Check out orvis, Redington, eBay, and flyshopcloseouts.com. My advice would be get the best outfit you can get, if you go to cheap and like it you'll end up feeling like you wasted your money on a cheap setup. If you get the best for you cash and realize you hate it. You can still flip it and get some money out of it."

flyfishing,3an3v0,Nman77,2,Tue Jun 23 22:56:00 2015 UTC,Broke the tip of my Orvis Clearwater and took it to my local fly shop where I purchased it and they sent it in to Orvis where they fixed it for free. Just take it to Cabela's and they should take care of it.
flyfishing,3an3v0,boneybob,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:38:38 2015 UTC,Dont orvis have lifetime warranties on all their rods?
flyfishing,3an3v0,BillyMurderface,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:51:55 2015 UTC,They used to but now its a 25 year warranty. Still really good.
flyfishing,3an3v0,boneybob,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:41:35 2015 UTC,Hell yeah!
flyfishing,3an3v0,BillyMurderface,4,Tue Jun 23 00:54:24 2015 UTC,"Well I work at a Cabelas retail store as a customer service rep.  So if it is a cabelas rod, you're in luck.  They have a lifetime warranty on Cabelas rods.  So what you'll do is go in, be very polite, be very patient, tell them about how you love cabelas products and have always had good luck with them and that you don't know why it broke.    Then you're going to ask for an exchange on the same product or one of a similar price.  They'll most likely take it, if not ask to speak with the manager who will give you a hard time, but ultimately take care of you.    Good luck!"
flyfishing,3an3v0,ked_man,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:22:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies, everyone. I had phoned Cabellas and was told that beyond one year there was nothing that they could do. It does look like damage as opposed to an accidental break; do you think they would still honor a return?"
flyfishing,3an3v0,ked_man,2,Mon Jun 22 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"If only one the butt section is left there's only one shot.  It's the big fish story. I helped a guy return a rod to TFO several years ago that only had the cork and the reel seat.  He was a regular, so I had no reason to doubt him and TFO had a lifetime warranty.    So his story was, and I suggest you adapt this to your story as well, that he was in Bolivia fishing for golden dorado.  While he was waiting on his guide the first morning he was practice casting his 10wt from the dock.  About the third practice cast a fish hit.  It started heading down river in the current and was losing line very fast.  He said he put his hand on the spool of the reel to try and slow the fish down and boom, his rod broke right at the cork.  The fish, still hooked up and burning line mind you.  The rod tip slid down his line and the fish broke his line.  All he had was a piece of a cork grip and a reel seat left.    If one were so inclined, this could be believable enough to warrant a return.  But you could just pony up and buy a new rod and not leave them on top of your car the next time.  It's up to you."
flyfishing,3an3v0,alextron,0,Mon Jun 22 21:47:28 2015 UTC,"Hah! Awesome story, thanks for sharing. I don't know that I'd go that far with this. I currently have all four pieces but a couple of them are crushed, not snapped in half. I'm creative but still have trouble imagining how a fish could cause this kind of damage.   At this point, I have actually already ""ponied up"" and bought a new rod. Just kinda wanted to get on with the great fishing! I was actually kinda wondering if people had any ""other"" creative uses or suggestions on what to make. If I were a teacher, I'd definitely have myself a new pointer. Just wondering if there's anything else to do before putting it in the trash. However, based on some peoples' suggestions, I may bring it back to the store and be relatively honest with them. FWIW, it was strapped to my roof and I thought it had been done so securely. Oh well.   Thanks for sharing your story!"

flyfishing,3akzpq,trick420,2,Sun Jun 21 13:36:28 2015 UTC,"The Chattahoochee is the closest to you I believe...  Holds trout from the dam all the way down to I-75 or slightly below that I believe...  If you want smaller water, you're going to have to go further north.  From Columbus I think I would head up I-75 to I-575, and from there up into Ellijay.  That seems to be the fastest location to get to.  From there, Amicolola creek is stocked, Mountaintown Creek isn't far away...  Most of the streams up there probably hold trout (I don't know that as a fact though).  If you go further north to Blue Ridge, the Toccoa tailwater there in town below the dam fishes great when the generators are off.  Depending on traffic, Ellijay/Blue Ridge is a solid 3 hours from you though just to get there.  Once you're there though there's options all around.  Helen, Ga has the upper, freestone section of the Chattahoochee, but it's even longer to get there at 3:15 depending on traffic.  I have a GA map of all the trout water and according to it there are two stocked creeks off I-75 in Whitfield County - Johns Creek near Resaca and Stamp Creek near Cassville / White.  I have no idea if they fish well or not and have never heard anyone talk about them with regard to fly fishing.  But, they would be closer and more accessable from the interstate I think.  Hope this helps!"

It is between all major interstates in Wyoming, and you could stop in Casper at a local shop to get conditions and flies before heading out. Public access right below the dam is good.

flyfishing,3ajlvf,Montuckian,3,Sun Jun 21 03:24:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I don't. I haven't lived in MT for a few years. Ask one of the fly guys out there.  Not sure where you're coming in from, but Kingfisher in Missoula is pretty solid, and if you're in the area, stop at the Merc at Rock Creek in Clinton. Guy who runs it is a buddy of mine and knows his stuff, not to mention that Rock Creek is one of my favorite MT spots. He's a younger guy, but his family has owned the merc for years and he's one of the best fish guys out there in a town full of fish guys.  Generally speaking though, I'd pick up some golden stones for the AM. Adams patterns for later on - I'm partial to the purple haze in about a 16 for most of those creeks as it'll get picked up more than your standard adams. I'd also look at BWOs and PMDs, try to get emerger patterns on the latter. Generally you'll see a lot of caddis out, but the fish don't key on them too heavily, although a small elk hair caddis or three is a good thing to keep in your box as a last resort. They've had a warm spring there too, so you'll likely be getting into terrestrials as well so pick up some hoppers and ants.  Sub surface will probably be hair's ears, princes, and the like. There's a bunch of whitefish up there that will key into your subsurface beads if you use them.  Edit: You can't go wrong with a few san juans as well. Last I checked, MT law allows for 2 hooks on a line, so top and drop that stuff as much as you can."

Not a big deal but when I need to get a lot of line in quickly it's super handy. If you do happen to go with the speedster is recommend getting the Speedster HD. It's got a whole frame instead of the lighter but less stable partial frame reel. I have noticed that the litespeed free spools a bit better than the speedster also. There is something to be said about the speedster design though. Reminds me of an old vintage car or something, they are pretty. Put a hatch in your hand sometime. They are truly worth every penny."

flyfishing,3aeffg,dahuii22,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:45:31 2015 UTC,You've got it correct. 100 yards of 20 lb backing is what it will take.
flyfishing,3aeffg,MaverickFly,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:53:50 2015 UTC,Also - no shame in having a fly shop do it right. They have the right tools to get the backing and line lay flat and spool evenly so you don't risk a snag if someone is ripping a lot of line off quickly.   Plus I usually use it as an excuse to treat myself to some new flies as a thank you
flyfishing,3aeffg,ianbouchard,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:46:01 2015 UTC,"Formulas are a place to start, but just like construction, it's better to let your materials and tools tell you the proper measurements and amounts.   So, nail or double nail knot your backing to the fly line. Tie your FLY LINE to the reel and start winding. Be as particular winding as you're actually going to be on the water.  If you're the rententive type that always reels and winds the line in perfect, ensuring its nice an even, do that. If you wind and don't give a fuck how the line goes on the reel, do that. Regardless of which type you are, when the backing goes on, pay attention and wind it on nice and neat (filling any gaps if you're a careless winder). Once the backing fills the reel appropriately, leave a couple inches extra and cut your backing.   Now, pull the whole thing of the reel. Tie on the backing, wind it nice and neat and then do your fly line however you like. Now you have enough backing not just based on the spool capacity, but customized to your own winding proclivities."
flyfishing,3aeffg,down_view,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:36:15 2015 UTC,"These guys have it right. You should not typically need to even get into your backing, but 100 yards is more than enough. Use an arbor knot to tie to reel hub. Wind on your 100 yrd of backing, then use a nail knot to tie to fly line. Make sure you leave plenty of space for when the entire line is on. You do not want your line rubbing on the reel.  Remember,  when you are reeling in a big fish, you will not be winding it nicely onto the reel."

But we've got a few good warmwater streams, but any rain turns them pretty milky so they arent too reliable.   There are a few bayous within downtown houston that have pretty good sized grass and common carp. I have yet to try them out, but most people usually have success once they get the hang of it.   Trout fishing is poor in all of texas. There are a few rivers that during the colder months will be stocked with 8-12"" rainbows. But its not a scenic river by all means.   Ive been wanting to hit the hill part of the country. There are a few rivers that are really good for smallmouth.   I dont know much about saltwater, I think most people prefer using a kayak and hitting the marshes for redfish, flounder, and speckled trout.   There is plenty of good fishing, just got to look around. Almost every pond will have some decent bass and bluegill. But you may run into gar down here as well, havent hooked into one yet.

Do they migrate to other parts of the river to grow bigger? Are there streams with trout that don't really have any larger pools or eddys causing the trout to remain small?

flyfishing,3aajuu,YouMonkeysYou,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's more likely they just don't live that long. IIRC a trout's growth rate is relatively constant over the course of its life, so they die whenever they outgrow the food supply.  C&R is still a good idea though."

Maybe fish the spring 2-4 times a year mostly from November to December. Two years ago I was fishing at Dam 3 when this family of Russians I was told by a local show up. Long Story short there was 5 of them. The oldest boy maybe 16-18 years old takes a net you would use for big cat fish goes to one end of the water drainage tile and gets his much smaller little brother to go to the other end and run up it. Comes out with a 25 inch brown easy off a nest of eggs.

flyfishing,3aa4jw,salpara,4,Thu Jun 18 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the beautiful aesthetic, but to take on the stream as my go-to box I'd go with something different.   That box will definitely be heavy, it's big, not waterproof and looks like it won't hold all that many flies. Also, what happens when it gets wet? Will the wood warp?   I know that tenkara guys are into these wooden fly boxes, so maybe there's more to it than I think. Like this one: http://threeriverstenkara.com/?product=mountain-stream-wooden-fly-box.   But I don't want to put a fly in your ointment here. I'd be really proud of myself if I could make something like that. The downsides of a wooden box would surely diminish to the pleasure it'd give me from using it."
flyfishing,3aa4jw,salpara,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"It's honestly not that heavy! I'd compare it to the weight of an iPhone or a Samsung smartphone. I'm just starting out so I definitely don't carry the same amount of tackle as most people here, but in the future I'll probably have to design one to carry more flies.   There really isn't a problem with getting wood wet, it's that you need to allow it to dry. I'll be coating this in beeswax, so like a cutting board it will have much more water resistance then an unfinished piece of wood. I'll have to apply it every little while, but the tackle box I built is holding up really well with beeswax on it. Warping shouldn't be too big of an issue but it's something that I'll only find out by using it.  You definitely hit it spot on with your last point about the downsides not out weighing the plus. I love building stuff and this is a way for me to be creative and show it off within another one of my hobbies. Plus I get to have a sweet looking fly box hanging off of me!"

flyfishing,3aa6zn,MG92Silverado,2,Thu Jun 18 13:24:02 2015 UTC,"I can't help much with that specific setup, as I just got the Streamlight outfit. I can say that L.L. Bean doesn't mess around - the Streamlight is a fantastic rod, so I'm sure the same quality extends to their other models. I was actually looking into the Quest for my father, who has recently shown interest in the sport but is currently rocking an old walmart rod that has the flex of a pool cue. Reviews look great for the Quest, and the price point is pretty amazing. It might be worth going to an L.L. Bean store and checking it out, if there is one near you.  I'm also new to the sport and I settled on a 5wt 8'6"" which I would say is a little too much rod for small brooks and streams, but I could get by I needed to. The 8'6"" can really haul a line out across a larger river, though.   I would say a 7'6"" would work for small to moderate streams and rivers, and is probably going to be a lot easier when it comes to mending and maneuvering in smaller areas."
flyfishing,3aa6zn,flyfishinct,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"The price for the quest just seems perfect for me as a beginner. And as I've researched a good bit, the 5wt seems to be the most popular but I'm afraid its just too big. I would like a happy medium."
flyfishing,3aa6zn,flyfishinct,2,Thu Jun 18 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"4wt line will likely land dry flies a little softer than 5wt, if presentation is important to you. A shorter rod will help you cast in tight spaces with a lot of trees / etc.  If that's going to be the majority of your fishing (spooky brookies and small pocket water) I think the 7'6"" with 4wt might be a little better for stealthiness. If you're more into streamer fishing on larger bodies of water (lakes/large rivers), maybe go with a 5wt and a longer rod. I don't find my 5wt to be too bulky presentation-wise, the rod seems delicate enough to get soft placement if I put some effort into it."
flyfishing,3aa6zn,Sug4rFree,2,Thu Jun 18 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"I own the Quest 2 in a 9' 6 wt. I love it. I can't say i've fished many other 6 weights but for the price point I really like it. I've taken a couple of casts with a Scott 5wt that I really liked too but i'm not sure on the price difference.   I've caught smallmouth, pickerel and largemouth on the quest. Mine is quite a soft flex which i like. I would definitely buy one again. I might even get a 3wt."

What I like best about it is LL Bean customer service.  I've broken the rod (my mistake) and LL Bean was completely understanding, ultimately getting me a new rod for the price of shipping.  Highly recommend the purchase."
flyfishing,3aa6zn,Kiernanstrat,2,Thu Jun 18 16:29:15 2015 UTC,"My first rod was the 7'6"" Quest II and I love it. It isn't heavy duty enough to sling a wet woolly bugger very far but as a dry fly and light nymphing rod it is perfect for the price. I would have to say though that the Quest II reel is not the best simply because it is made of plastic. I had an issue with the line being able to work itself between the reel and spool since they didn't fit together well enough. However when I told LLBean about the issue they upgraded me to a streamlight for no additional cost which was unusual but very welcome. I also have the 6'6"" 3wt and it works just fine. You can't go wrong with LLBean due to the lifetime guarantee. Since this is your first rod I would go with the full Quest setup and if the reel gives you issues you can return it separately and upgrade to a streamlight reel."

Here is a recent review I read that was from last month:  The ★★★★ 2015 Subaru Outback 2.5i Premium flirts shamelessly with perfection, falling just short, but establishing itself as a vehicle to beat among small and midsize SUVs and station wagons.  The all-new 2015 Outback delivers value, comfort, practicality and features. Competitive five-passenger wagons and SUVs like the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, Jeep Cherokee, Kia Sportage, Mazda CX-5, Nissan Rogue, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Golf station wagon will have trouble matching the Outback.  Shoppers looking at the Outback also sometimes consider larger vehicles, like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the seven-seat Toyota Highlander, according to data from Autotrader.  The Outback's advanced features – included automatic braking to avoid front collisions and well-tuned adaptive cruise control – should also draw comparisons to small luxury SUVs from Audi, Lexus, Mercedes and Mini."
flyfishing,3a6mgi,cabose4prez,3,Wed Jun 17 18:10:06 2015 UTC,pretty affordable as far as new cars go too. But I don't like how the Outback has morphed into an SUV crossover. I like the wagons.

They won't compare to a Subaru/Toyota in terms of lack of maintenance, but they're also way more luxurious inside with a more refined/relaxing ride.  And they won't be as cheap as a Toyota or Ford to fix.  I drive a 1998 V70R, and I'm a sales rep, so I drive 40K+ miles a year, so I do regular maintenance all the time anyway.

flyfishing,3a5wc9,DusterNOBO15,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"If you're starting out on warm water ponds, which is a great way to go, I would go for the lighter weight rods, probably a 4 or 5.  Rationale being that most of what you'll catch in those ponds will be sunfish and small bass, which these rods are fine for--additionally, lower weight rods lead to less casting fatigue which is a big factor while starting out.  If you happen to hook a 10+ pound largemouth, it will probably just snap your tippet rather than causing structural damage to such a rod.  If storage is not a big issue, some people will favor a 2pc over a 4 pc rod for learning to cast, but I think this is a minor issue.  As your skills increase, you will likely want to add rods that are of higher quality, and/or different weights depending on what you're going after.  Congrats on taking up the sport, you will have a blast!"

flyfishing,3a5wc9,Trover,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:59:04 2015 UTC,I would say a 5wt would do just about everything you need in that part of the country.
flyfishing,3a5wc9,erdkunde,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:55:46 2015 UTC,"Make sure you check the sidebar with regards to starting out in our great hobby!   You did a really great job of telling everyone your target species and the overall locations and water types you'll be fishing.   Next big question/step: What's your budget? (and under that question-what other gear do you have? Waders and boots? A vest? etc etc). This will help everyone really target what you need, within your budget, and recommend accordingly.   Overall for your needs, 9'5wt for sure will cover everything you'll be coming across. Any less will be too stressful for both your learning curve and the fish you're trying to land, and any more can be overkill and limit some of your fishing (like throwing dry flies w a 6-7wt).  Hope this helps!"
flyfishing,3a5wc9,dahuii22,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:59:53 2015 UTC,"First off it sounds like you have learned a lot though your own research, which is great. I agree that an 8wt is probably overkill for your purposes. A 6wt for bass and other larger freshwater fish is pretty standard but is a little heavy for trout so if you want a single rod that will work for both I would go with a 5wt. That being said, flyfishing was invented with trout in mind and it seems like you are inclined to start targeting them. I would strongly recommend attempting to catch them with a spin rod first. Learning where to find trout in a stream is a lot easier with a spinner or even a worm. Use your fly rod on bass to practice casting, hooking and landing fish. Bass are far more forgiving than trout when it comes to presentation. Once you are comfortable with a fly rod in your hand you can head out to the streams. Even still learning to fish for trout in streams is a challenge.   As far as equipment goes there are plenty of resources out there to give you a hand. My personal favorite company is LLBean. It doesn't have the really high end stuff you will eventually want but their lower end rods and reels are great and not expensive. Best thing about LLBean is their life time guarantee on everything that has their name on it. There are of course many other companies out there that you can get cheap stuff at I just don't have personal experience with their equipment.  Buying a first fly rod is a tough decision. It really comes down to the fish you are targeting and their size. I am going to just go ahead and recommend 5wt since it is the standard all around rod weight. Something between 8 and 9 feet with moderate to fast action. If you have any specific questions I'd be happy to tell you what I know."
flyfishing,3a5wc9,Kiernanstrat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"I would go with a 6wt, all of orvis's complete set ups are a great buy, and pretty low cost. Whatever you get, make sure it has a good warranty. My first rod/reel combo was a reddington crosswater, it snapped and had a terrible warranty. I was out $150."

flyfishing,3a5wc9,weatherwar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:40:24 2015 UTC,I just started out and have landed some big fish on my 5wt. I'd recommend a 5wt haha
flyfishing,3a5wc9,jrmunro11,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"5wt.  I started int he same position as you. People will tell you everything for bass rods. I've fished them with a 3-8wt and 7wt switch. Bass are not hard fighting fish. I have run into <10 5lb+ LMB which would actually take my 5wt for a ride. In every other situation a 5wt is a great balance, and allows you to fish for trout effectively still.   A 6wt is entering trophy trout territory. It's my go-to for larger streamer fishing and some utility on the hopper action. Perfect for smallmouth on my local river.  Nothing carries a bass streamer better than a 7wt. It has the mass to carry those big balls of marabou and rabbit across the entire river. It's a specialized rod though, and I don't think I would want to use them unless I'm throwing those same streamers to big bull trout.  8wt is overgunning -- not only will the fish just be able to be hauled in on an 8wt, but the streamers you can throw with an 8wt are either for mongo-bass, or for smaller pike.  I find a 3 and 4 to be too small to really throw a bigger streamer a meaningful distance, but if it's on a small pond, it sure is fun to hook up with some big bass.  Luckily bass eat just about anything, and to get the utility you need for both trout and bass fishing I would highly recommend a 5wt. This also lets you get a feel in between ""big"" rod, which can get heavy, or small rod, which generally are not able to shoot the line as far. The 5wt will do everything you need it to do. Once you're fully addicted I could see you specializing in streamers in which case you'll get a mroe dedicated set-up, probably a 7wt. 5wt is the way to start though."

If you use super glue to keep them in place they lose flexibility too and the braid will fray at the end.

When I had to use one stream-side the other day I dribbled super glue onto my waders and stuck my fingers together :("

Also good for line repairs if you nick or cut the line. Use flexible water based glue and light mono nail knots to secure.  I'm sure your welded ones are good too. Cheers."

flyfishing,3a2xjs,CharlesMan,3,Tue Jun 16 20:29:13 2015 UTC,My small hook sharpener is oft-used while fishing. Has made a big difference.
flyfishing,3a2xjs,EuroNymphGuy,2,Tue Jun 16 22:12:12 2015 UTC,Make sure you're keeping enough tension on the line n you'll do just fine....also dont horse it in and make sure the hook set is right and try not to let the fish wrap up a fin in the line and and and and it takes practice.
flyfishing,3a2xjs,justworkthingshere89,2,Tue Jun 16 21:59:24 2015 UTC,"I learned to try and keep the fish's head above water as much as possible as you reel it in. It reduces the fight time and is healthier for the fish, IMO. Lactic acid build up is more dangerous than the slight asphyxiation it suffers. Are they spitting the hooks or is the line breaking off? Wet your knots. Keep the rod tip high."
flyfishing,3a2xjs,ScottyBondo,2,Wed Jun 17 00:26:51 2015 UTC,Rod tip up. Also i would say don't be afraid to set that hook. If your using a lower weight and fishing for trout make sure you set that hook good or he will shake it. If it's in the first 3 seconds tho i would definitely recomend making sure your rod tip is high and if your reeling in line that may be the cause as well. Try stripping instead of going to the reel. Obviously if you have a chance later get to the reel if possible. Basically make sure that fish is hooked good and keep that rod tip up is my suggestions.
flyfishing,3a2xjs,DankKabra,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:54:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on the type of fish.... it's pretty common to have those results with steelhead, but not so much other types of trout.  Are you keeping the line tight?"
flyfishing,3a2xjs,RoverLife,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:59:25 2015 UTC,Yea my like always has tension once a fish is on. Maybe I have too much or too little tension? They tend to get off my hook within the first 3 seconds
flyfishing,3a2xjs,O_oblivious,2,Tue Jun 16 22:22:38 2015 UTC,"If the line isn't snapping occasionally, it's not too much tension."
flyfishing,3a2xjs,tomchou,2,Wed Jun 17 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"Likely you are not setting hard enough and your timing might be slightly off.  If you're fishing dries, you might be setting too quickly, if you're fishing nymphs, especially small ones, you might be slightly too slow.  But since you're hooking the fish and the tippet isn't breaking, you're definitely not striking too hard.  I will absolutely lay into a fish on some hook sets, if it's timed right it almost can't be too hard (especially if you fish soft rods that protect tippets)  Once the fish is hooked, you should fight it very aggressively and don't bother getting it onto the reel unless it takes enough line to naturally get onto the reel itself.  IMO, most fish are lost by babying them when in reality you'll have the best chance to land fish by playing them to the limit of your tippet and making short work of the fight."

flyfishing,3a2xjs,gibsjame,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:13:14 2015 UTC,what are you fishing for?
flyfishing,3a2xjs,Lazerbunnyfuntime,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:23:35 2015 UTC,Are you putting the fish on the reel? I see that happen a lot where a guy will go straight to the reel to fight the fish and lose it.
flyfishing,3a2ul4,DatBlacksmith,5,Tue Jun 16 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"I just started fly fishing last year and I was in the same spot you are. I started with a Tenkara tod so I didn't have to worry about reels or lines. I just went to the fly shop, asked a few questions about what good default flies worked in my area. I bought about 40 different flies and just started hitting the rivers every chance I got. I would cycle through flies until I started getting bites or catching fish. It really isn't that hard once you get started, ignore the majority of info that is out there for now and just go enjoy yourself. I think people try and make it seem a lot harder than it is because they have the elitist douchebag mentality and giant egos."
flyfishing,3a2ul4,w12x40,2,Tue Jun 16 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"You'll enjoy yourself more if you catch a few fish, and getting a little extra information will help you do that."
flyfishing,3a2ul4,DatBlacksmith,3,Tue Jun 16 21:36:16 2015 UTC,that is why i asked questions at the fly shop. i'm just saying not to get too overwhelmed with the vast amount of stuff online. find out the basics that work in your area and get after it. i wasn't saying OP should go out with no knowledge at all.
flyfishing,3a2ul4,w12x40,5,Tue Jun 16 22:00:44 2015 UTC,"Go visit the local fly shop. They'll tell you what flies to use and, conveniently, will sell you a few of the flies they suggested. Remember that they want your repeat business, and a chewed-up fly is a great way to get you come back to buy waders, rods, line and such.  Failing that, look for stream reports on line for the stream you want. That should give you an idea of what's happening on the stream right then. Some give species, others give patterns.  Also, I've caught 90% of my trout on a Bead-head Prince nymph, Parachute Adams and black Wooly Bugger."
flyfishing,3a2ul4,EuroNymphGuy,4,Tue Jun 16 21:25:31 2015 UTC,"80%+ of a trout's diet comprises of sub-surface creatures. Little brown, black and grey bugs.  So, if you're going for trout, go for nymphs, IMO: hare's ear and pheasant tails are a good start."
flyfishing,3a2ul4,WheelsAndGears,2,Tue Jun 16 22:20:46 2015 UTC,"Only a small amount of experience here, but this is about what I did and it worked for me.   Buy a basic combo rod and reel then get line matched to that so you don't fight with the wrong line. Find a local group that you can learn to cast from. Get a few basic techniques going, then practice them.  Floating flies were easier for me to see and use. Ponds seem to be the easier place to learn and practice due to fewer trees and more open area. When you go to the stream, find a rapid or swift area, toss the fly to the top, let it float down. Repeat it a lot.  Then you can start branching out to other locations, techniques, and gear. For picking flies, try to pick ones that look like local bugs."
flyfishing,3a2ul4,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:29:35 2015 UTC,"I have a hand-me-down reel, but when I unspool it, it clicks after a 16th of a rotation, so when I'm really unspooling my line it is a very loud buzzing sound. I feel like this would scare away the fish, is that normal?"
flyfishing,3a2ul4,weatherwar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:55:28 2015 UTC,"It depends on the reel, as to if it is normal, and how loud it is will affect if it scares the fish. My reel is an automatic one and it makes a bit of a ratcheting/buzzing sound as line is stripped out. It is not real loud and I don't think it will affect the fish. The noise would have to be pretty loud for it to affect fish.  You are only going to be stripping the line out if you're getting ready to cast. Once you have the line out, there is very little that will be done with the reel generally, until you reel it in to move locations or catch a fish.   Maybe watch a few youtube videos of other fly fishers to see if their reels make a similar sound. I assume you have an automatic reel if it's making noise like that. There also may be a drag adjustment or release button that you mess with to change the amount of noise. Furthermore, your reel might need a little lubrication which could help with that a bit, but find out what you're doing with that before you go spraying motor oil in your reel. You might destroy the thing if you use the wrong stuff or take the wrong thing apart."
flyfishing,3a2ul4,jfred17,2,Wed Jun 17 23:38:41 2015 UTC,"Woah woah, this is still fishing right?!  We can get to all that nonsense once we learn to cast and start catching fish.  Just get a cheapo rod set-up, if you're actually considering getting into the sport I recommend spending $150-$200 on a complete set-up. This should get you the rod, reel, backing, fly line, leader and two or three spools of tippet.  Then all you need are some foam flies - anything really. Go to your local pond or lake, or any body of water in your area, and catch bluegill. I recommend reaching out to a local group, like a Trout Unlimited to find someone to come to a local pond with you and get you casting right, Otherwise, watch lots of youtube videos, and then go to the pond and test out what they teach you."

flyfishing,3a2wam,cabose4prez,2,Tue Jun 16 21:46:03 2015 UTC,"Ha, I was going to come here and say ""go Sling or go home.""  I have a fully waterproof sling -- it fits food, water, DSLR, three reels, four fly boxes ect... It fits whatever I need, and it's what I take out when I'll be out for a full day. I usually take it off to fish if I'm staying in the same spot.  If I'm only going out for a bit I'll take five flies and a rod/reel.  A vest is annoying and only gets in the way IMO."
flyfishing,3a2wam,weatherwar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:29:55 2015 UTC,Hi there - what sling?  I'm a vest guy but my interest in a sling has been piqued...  Also where do you attach your net?

flyfishing,3a2wam,Misanthraloper,3,Wed Jun 17 16:21:00 2015 UTC,"I started with a vest, moved to a sling pack, and now, fish a chest pack. The William Joseph Confluence is great if you're a fish-all-day person. Sling pack has been great for me for 1/2 days, but if I'm out all day, I put too much water in there, makes the pack tilt to one side, and that all tweaks my back."
flyfishing,3a2wam,EuroNymphGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:14:14 2015 UTC,"i have had the same problem with sling packs... I've heard that many people like the William Josph Confuence because it sit higher on your torso, and helps you to wade deeper without getting your gear wet."

flyfishing,3a2wam,rustyinco,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:22:17 2015 UTC,"After much trial and error I have become a waterproof waist pack and backpack guy. I find it to be out of the way when fighting bigger fish such as steelhead and salmon. But if you are set on a vest I would go with THIS or THIS it's a bit cheaper. The first one is cool because it is a backpack as well. Definitely a plus to have to carry stuff like TP and headlamps, extra fly boxes ect. If you go with the second one you can add a Patagonia backpack later to spread out the expense."
flyfishing,3a2wam,Blackout356,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"i have tried standard vests, hip packs, chest packs and am now using a hybrid pack vest by patagonia. I really like it. It'll carry everything i need, and when i need a little more room for, say extra gloves and a sweater it's got enough room. It was a little more expensive than it needed to be, but oh well.  It dries quickly, isn'y bulky is light and has enough storage for what i like to carry. For a full day I cary a rain jacket, water, some food, flashlight, mace (for dogs and drunks), pocketknife, sunglasses/RX glasses - and i try to go light on the fishing gear  2-3 tippet spools, one med-large fly box, tungsten putty, an altoids box with indicators, floatant, nippers hemostats, and that's about it. I generally have room left over. I agree with others that less is more, and it can be the case that having too many pockets in a vest can lead you to packing more than you really need. The only real complaint i have with it is that the rear elastic for attaching a jacket/sweater and rod tube can sometimes tangle with my line when i make a not-so great cast. I guess I can't really blame the vest for that tho.  So having used a few things, what I'd look out for is anything that uses a lot of mesh with exposed threads (fishpond uses a lot of this). Hooks, especially those with the barbs still on them get caught terribly in them, and it's almost impossible to get them out. Lots of nylon fabric that isn't tightly woven can suffer from this too. I'd also stay away from anything that is cotton or untreated canvas - it gets heavy as heck, and will sap the warmth off of you when it gets cold. Vests that have many many places to attach zingers and other things that hang off of you are not that great, for me at least. I find that when you have a lot of stuff hanging off and clattering around, it's just more to get tangled in the bushes and fly lines and make landing a fish harder. The Patagonia vest has just enough places to keep things close at hand, but still tucked far enough away to not be in the way.  If you do get a vest, be sure to get one that has a place to attach a net at the back collar - really is the most convenient place to keep a net while wading.   A Sling pack might be good, too as others mentioned - a word of caution, tho - i have back problems and having the weight on only one shoulder wound up causing me lots of problems. Otherwise I really did like the amount of storage and general convenience of it."
flyfishing,3a2wam,benalt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:29:04 2015 UTC,I have the same vest. I recently got a fishpond lumbar pack and thought I would be using that predominately. Not the case... I find myself preferring the hybrid pack most days on the water for many of the same reasons. Plus it's perfect for holding a Camelback!

flyfishing,3a2wam,benalt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:00:14 2015 UTC,"lol, yeah. I'm actually a little embarrassed of wearing the brand name stuff - i hate paying more than something is really worth. I really only got it because It really fit what i was looking for. I had my heart set on something with small backpack-sized capacity for the stuff i cary with the pockets of a vest. Fishpond makes one for a comparable price that i looked at, but was wary of anything with exposed mesh netting. I really wanted one of those nice Filson vests, but didn't have an additional $200 to plunk down.  I get what you're saying - buying fishing gear as a fashion statement is pretty silly, but what it comes down to is having something that i feel fits my needs and will be durable enough to last a few years - don't really care what brand it is as long as it fits...."
flyfishing,3a2wam,ryanando,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:02:16 2015 UTC,Not faulting you at all they make great gear. The owner of my local fly shop called it Patagucci one day I use the expression frequently. I just think it's funny

flyfishing,3a2wam,gibsjame,0,Wed Jun 17 21:45:58 2015 UTC,Honestly a vest is a vest. It has pockets and holds your shit.  Spend your money on other things and just grab the one that seems to fit right. Also you don't need to fill all the pockets just cause they're there.
flyfishing,3a2wam,w12x40,0,Wed Jun 17 00:40:20 2015 UTC,"Vests encourage you to put too much stuff in them and make your shoulders sore. I'd suggest a chest pack and a hydration pack. At the moment, I have an old Orvis chest pack attached to an old Camelbak with shock cord, parachute cord and zip ties.   Fishpond, Simms, Orvis, William Joseph and LL Bean all make good gear."
flyfishing,3a1tbq,Brancher,6,Tue Jun 16 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"Wading belt is a must.  Never go without it.  One of those CO2 PFD  vests if you're going in fast and deep water.  If you do go down and the water is pulling you, get your feet downstream.  Lay back and swim on your back to the best exit."
flyfishing,3a1tbq,Shpadoinkles,4,Tue Jun 16 16:52:49 2015 UTC,"I've swam in waders a few times. I wouldn't recommend it, but it's not as perilous as its reputation. I read Joe Brooks tried just about every variation of swimming in waders, including diving off a bridge with no problems.   On a related note, if you're fishing a tailwater fishery and they sound the siren, you should definitely get out of the water in a timely manner."
flyfishing,3a1tbq,Steely_Dan,2,Tue Jun 16 16:37:33 2015 UTC,"Wading belt, and a wading staff are the best thing you could get. Don't wade in murky wader or anything you think is to strong. Make sure when your foot is planted it is planted on a solid rock and not one that will move when you do.  Edit:this is more of a don't let your waders fill, if they did however un clip and lose them. Can try to get them back later."

I'm not sure if there is a term for it but I guess I'm looking on advice for how to ""wet exit"" waders.  I don't see how I could possibly get them off just by unclipping and loosening them because of the boots."
flyfishing,3a1tbq,cabose4prez,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:03:25 2015 UTC,"Would definitely depend on the type of waders, boot foot or stockingfoot"
flyfishing,3a1tbq,PoopingUnicorn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"If you're in a fast-moving current, trying to ""wet-exit"" the waders would likely get you in deeper trouble.  I've gone under in mine & been fine, easy enough to get my footing & make my way to shore.  If you're using fly-fishing specific waders, they're should be tighter to you and not have the huge openings the cheapo waders will have that allow water to pour in by the gallon.  If you're that paranoid about it, get your waders on, have a friend nearby and/or life vest on, and hop in the local lake.  I think you'll find it not too hard to maneuver yourself back to shore."
flyfishing,3a1tbq,raymondio,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you're better off just trying to make it to the bank. Don't worry about losing the waders until you find footing/land. People think you sink when waders fill but that's not true; you become buoyant. It's getting out of the water that is hard (waders filled with water is lots of extra weight.. 3 pounds per liter I believe).  People who die wet wading in waders do not drown from simply falling in; they get stuck in underwater trees or they panic and exhaust themselves."
flyfishing,3a1tbq,Kiernanstrat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"I have some neoprene waders with built in boots and I bring a knife clipped to the shoulder strap so in an emergency I can cut the straps and swim out, hopefully.

Its not the safest, but doing this rather than swimming can help you get into good fishing positions you couldn't get to by going directly across (and save your life)"

I took it out a couple miles into Saginaw Bay (further than I should have) and caught a 10lb cat, no problems. While I wouldn't go that far out again without a support craft, I don't hesitate to go anywhere on the inland lakes by myself. Handles 1-2 foot waves easily, larger waves are scary. Haven't taken it on any large rivers yet, just small ones like the rifle, it wasn't quite as maneuverable as I would have liked, but it wasn't bad. Only down side is that it's heavy at 62 lbs."

flyfishing,3a1j6h,ShittingVomit,2,Tue Jun 16 17:21:05 2015 UTC,"Have you checked out a Hobie with a Mirage Drive? They are pedal driven with a rudder and incredibly stable.  I had a Revolution and could kick my feet over the side into the water when landing fish without any problems.    They are a good deal more expensive than other Kayaks but having the pedals and rudder while fly fishing is priceless.  Imo they're worth saving up for, and there are always good second hand opportunities.  Just be sure to inspect the mirage drive, they're expensive and if not cared for they can go to shit.  This was more of a problem for me as I lived by the ocean, in your area they'll likely all of only been used in fresh water.   I kept a paddle strapped to the side in case I got the mirage drive stuck in mud or on a shoreline but I rarely used it.  I actually just recommended this to someone in another thread here, seems to be kayak day.    If you're rich you might as well spring for the Pro Angler model, it's an absolute beast of a Kayak for fishing and easily twice as stable as the Revolution."
flyfishing,3a1j6h,ShittingVomit,2,Tue Jun 16 15:55:37 2015 UTC,Not rich! I will check out the Hobie as well. Are you able to stand and cast on these kayaks with motors / pedals? I guess I'm also interested if fly fisherman have found that standing is necessary in general...
flyfishing,3a1j6h,WhiskeyRock,2,Tue Jun 16 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"Standing isn't so easy in the revolution, it's an ordinary kayak with the mirage drive and rudder so it isn't great for standing.    You can stand in the Pro Angler, they have a standing bar to support you for it too."

flyfishing,39z4y1,mon_name,2,Tue Jun 16 00:30:59 2015 UTC,Nice fish! Why are the colors so yellow/golden?
flyfishing,39z4y1,suthe1np,3,Tue Jun 16 01:23:35 2015 UTC,"The coloration is different from a resident brookie because it is fresh from the ocean. On the east coast of Canada (and the U.S. I think) some brook trout spend time in the ocean and migrate back up stream similar to steelhead on the west coast. Much like steelhead, brook trout also change color when they go to the ocean, taking on a more silver/gold coloration."

I was just wondering if you think that they are more effective than a floating rapala or something similar.
flyfishing,39zxpw,Kiernanstrat,3,Tue Jun 16 14:38:10 2015 UTC,"More effective? Kind of depends on your efficiency with a fly rod.  I think it is, but I'm more confident with a fly rod in my hand at this point."

Great reel for the price although it is a bit on the heavy side. My brother just bought the Streamlight reel and I was very impressed with it. Lighter and cheaper than my older Double L although the drag seemed just a little less smooth. Lifetime guarantee doesn't hurt either.

flyfishing,3a0b20,Kiernanstrat,2,Tue Jun 16 14:12:29 2015 UTC,So casting from a seated position out of this little kayak would be possible and enjoyable?
flyfishing,3a0b20,trick420,4,Tue Jun 16 14:42:08 2015 UTC,Many people fish from kayaks and honestly where there is a will there is a way. My one piece of advice is that some kayaks have foot pedals that you can pump and hold your position which makes fishing much easier since you aren't constantly drifting away.
flyfishing,3a0b20,ShittingVomit,3,Tue Jun 16 15:00:11 2015 UTC,Yep.  I do it all the time.  A long rod helps - 9' minimum.
flyfishing,3a0b20,mondof,2,Tue Jun 16 15:02:08 2015 UTC,"10 ft. rod helps but a 9 ft. is totally doable, it might take a bit of time to get used but soon you'll be swinging bugs like a pro from a seated position."
flyfishing,3a0b20,ShittingVomit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:58:35 2015 UTC,What's the advantage of a 10' rod on a kayak?  I fish (not flyfish though) the ocean in a Prowler 15 and find that my 8' rods are a pain when I have feed my line though the guides since my reel is practically in the water off of the stern. Seven foot rods are more manageable to me but any shorter and I would have a problem getting my line around the bow (it is a long boat). I plan to try flyfishing from my kayak soon but the only fly rod I have is nine feet.
flyfishing,3a0b20,ShittingVomit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"Nine foot fly rod will be totally fine, don't read too much into my comment on that.  You'll notice things are quite a bit different with a fly rod when you get out there.  The 10 foot rod is just easier to cast farther but it sounds like you're pretty far from having to worry about that."
flyfishing,3a0b20,erdkunde,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"I used to fish in the southern California harbors almost every day with a Hobie Mirage.  Tons of fun, the sand bass and spotties would hit streamers like a ton of bricks. You'll want something to manage the line in between your legs though.  The Hobie is nice because it's pedal driven with a rudder, they're a bit more than normal kayaks but they're worth every penny if you plan on primarily using the Kayak for fishing."

Regardless of what they say I would then ask the property owner of possible. In my state (Texas) the riverbed is state property and as long as I am properly licensed I can walk the riverbed and be fine.

I feel like I can typically tell if someone fishes, or if someone just went fishing and caught this baby bow, and is now hanging it by the hook or strangling it for a pic. It's almost becoming a trend and style where I live, more than an escape or an activity/hobby. All these fly fishing videos that have been coming out lately, are more about being seen fly fishing, than actually fly fishing it seems. This is a total separate rant about the ""artsy fly culture"" that's evolving now. Relevant maybe ?  Sorry if I offend anyone.

flyfishing,39ynx7,nephewjephew,6,Mon Jun 15 21:27:05 2015 UTC,I've got an orvis recon 9ft 5 wt. I use it on the Neuse river in Raleigh NC for bass and pan fish. A 6 or 7 wt would be a bit better for the bigger flies but I stayed at 5 for trout expeditions. Someday I'll buy another. It's hard to chuck a clauser's with it but it gets the job done.
flyfishing,39ynx7,YouMonkeysYou,5,Mon Jun 15 22:40:52 2015 UTC,Don't go short don't go short don't go short.   Get a 10ft 7wt and thank me later.
flyfishing,39ynx7,_iFish,3,Tue Jun 16 02:57:15 2015 UTC,"I live in the same area and love to fish for smallmouth in the rivers. For bass, I use an 8wt Cabela's rod but I throw a lot of big flies when bass fishing so I like the heavier weight.   I also don't have a rod in between my 4wt and 8wt but even if I did, I think I would still use the 8wt.  Another thing to keep in mind is that pretty much anywhere there are bass, there are also pike."
flyfishing,39ynx7,Schommer,2,Tue Jun 16 00:40:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely don't get the 7'11"" rod.  The only reason it's that length is to comply with tournament regulations (under 8').  That's the only reason it's called a ""bass"" rod."

flyfishing,39ynx7,Nugetz111,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:52:07 2015 UTC,"As you probably know, the size of the fly cast dictates the weight of the rod.  The good news is your 8wt is the most useful all-around rod (although it is a little undergunned for big pike flies and lacks the fighting backbone for 7kg+ salmon).  I own a 4wt (for trout dries), a 5wt (that is almost never touched), two 6wt (for trout streamers and nymphs, and smallies) and an 8wt (for bass, pike, steelhead, salmon, and bonefish).  For smallmouth, I have used a 6wt and an 8wt.  I prefer the 8wt for open water (where there is likely to be windier conditions, and the an advantage to make longer casts) and the 6wt for streams (it is easier to mend line and typically use smaller flies).  I will take the 8wt for rivers if it is windy.  Although, if I had to choose one rod for bass fishing, it would be an 8wt."
flyfishing,39ynx7,DrSkunkzor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:53:40 2015 UTC,"I know 7wts are sometimes considered to be a specialty rod, but I use my 9 foot in the Great Lakes region (northern Michigan specifically) not only for bass, but for steelhead in the fall."
flyfishing,39ynx7,bunnn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"My go-to bass rod is a TFO TiCr 6wt (no fighting butt).  Fly size is as important as the species of fish when you're choosing a rod, and I throw big, nasty flies when bass fishing.. Unless I'm smallie fishing, then it's boogle bugs all day long.  Either way, I decided years ago that I would either be an even or an odd...  I chose even, so my rods range from 2 to 8wt in even steps.  I no longer own a 5wt or a 7wt (but I used to).  I use my 8wt for saltwater (bays, flats) and for big freshwater (Stripers,Drum,Hybrids)  For large and smallmouth, a 6wt is the sweet spot for me.  Go 9' or longer though.  I fish lakes and big rivers for bass, so I want the extra length.  The only time a shorter rod helps is in tighter casting conditions."

Of course they are lakes you can get into and catch fish but there aren't a ton of places to step into and most of the lakes I've fished have a dense weed line 5-10 feet from shore. If you could get your hands on some kayaks or a canoe, then any lake would be great.  With that being said, I'm a fan of Cedar and Brownie for my shore fishing. Plenty of bluegills in the shallows (and bedding at the moment) with the chance to catch some bass. Brownie has a decent spot to wade in with room for casting by the boat racks."

I fish spate rivers which drain mountains and peat bogs. It's all a bit too acidic, unfortunately. The upside is that we get reasonable runs of sea trout and, later in the season, some salmon.

flyfishing,39wqd0,francisjoe,4,Mon Jun 15 12:46:05 2015 UTC,Check the sidebar. Most common suggestion from most guys will be a 9'5wt.
flyfishing,39wqd0,dahuii22,3,Mon Jun 15 13:02:53 2015 UTC,"Suggestion is always a 9'5wt but people seem to be ignoring what you'd like to do primarily.  Based on what you want I would get the 4wt for rivers, creeks, and streams fishing mostly dry.   4 wt will be big enough for you on these rivers, is still a good size to learn on, and will make presenting the dries you want a bit easier while keeping your leader shorter.  On small streams with a ton of brush like in NE this makes a big difference.   8.5' will still be long enough to nymph but will make casting on those streams a bit easier.   That reel is just fine."

flyfishing,39wqd0,bntrns,2,Mon Jun 15 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"You could probably go soft something a little on the short side. I know guys who use 10 ft 4 wt for dry flies as well as nymphs, but something in the 8-9 foot range is probably a safe bet. That being said, I have a st croix 9 ft 5 wt and almost exclusively nymph with it, but it can easily throw dries, big streamers and poppers, just as easily as heavy nymph rigs. An all around great all purpose rod. I also have the Redington surge reel and it has served me very well, tough and durable and not off the wall expensive. Not super fancy, but it gets the job done without any issues."
flyfishing,39wqd0,happy_sauerkraut,2,Tue Jun 16 02:32:17 2015 UTC,I have the 9' 5wt imperial.. great setup. I use it for trout.. bass and even steelhead
flyfishing,39wqd0,happy_sauerkraut,2,Mon Jun 15 16:53:20 2015 UTC,In my opinion I would go with the 5 weight. The St Croix Imperial is a great rod. I do have the 9' version and it works great for me.  The Battenkill reel is not bad for a beginner. If you haven't bought it yet check out Redington Surge.   Make sure to check out eBay to see if you can find them slightly used. You could save quite some money.  Hope this helps.
flyfishing,39wqd0,reconditelost,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:08:07 2015 UTC,is the redington surge better than the battenkill or is it just a less expensive option for a beginner?
flyfishing,39wqd0,_iFish,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:12:22 2015 UTC,I think the surge is a little better (I have both). But this is of course a personal preference. At the end the reel holds line while you fish. Good luck.

flyfishing,39uxgc,dahuii22,3,Mon Jun 15 01:15:58 2015 UTC,"Take a drive up and over to Reliance, TN and fish the Hiwassee River.  Use caddis, Isonychia, sulphur, griffiths gnat dry patterns.  Bead head pheasant tail, zebra midges and hares ear nymphs work great as do olive woolly buggers.   Wide open river which is easy casting for a beginner and stocked heavily with trout that are eager to bite.  Make sure to go in the morning before they turn on the generators; zero to one generator running and you can wade the river, with two generators on you will need a kayak, personal pontoon or a drift boat."

flyfishing,39uwmk,recursivefaults,2,Mon Jun 15 00:13:44 2015 UTC,"You need to work on your casting abilities in general. Wooly buggers are from from heavy flies for a 5 or 6wt rod. My guess is that your timing is a little off, plus the little bit of added weight is really messing it up."
flyfishing,39uwmk,cabose4prez,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:22:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback!
flyfishing,39uwmk,Luvz2Spooje,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:26:26 2015 UTC,"Try attaching a piece of 30 lbs test off your fly line, then either stepping down to a lower test (like 20 lbs), or attaching your fly line to that. I have a 9 wt rod I use for saltwater with really heavy flies, and that initial transition from the fly line to the heavy weight fishing line, lighter weight fishing line, then a tapered leader really helps turn over a heavy fly. You'll have to play with line weights/length combinations to see what works.  Edit: With a 6-5 wt setup you may want a lower test then I mentioned above."
flyfishing,39uwmk,blatherdrift,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:49:30 2015 UTC,Let's hear about your leader and tippet. What kind of casts are you making? How much line are you trying to shoot and what size woolie bugger are you using?  Size 2 might be too big weighted for your rod? weight doesn't matter as much as the action. What rod are you using exactly?
flyfishing,39uwmk,ked_man,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:11:31 2015 UTC,"With heavier flies, use heavier leaders.  Use the biggest tapered leader you can find, usually like a 0X.  Or tie your own.    Then cast with a larger arc.  It throws a bigger loop and gives you more room for error when the gravity pulls that heavier fly down into the rest of your line.  Then power up the cast.  The extra power translates to faster line speed and carries the fly better and doesn't give it as much time to fall.  Next learn to double haul which puts more bend in the rod and helps pay out line quicker.  And if your up for one more, cast about 3/4 side arm.  It puts the fly out to the side a bit and it's less likely to tangle.    I fish heavily weighted clousers and wooly buggers on a 3wt and do just fine, most of the time."
flyfishing,39u0g5,Dueker_Jones,4,Sun Jun 14 19:34:18 2015 UTC,Those casting distances are very exaggerated and you're using a very wrong line.   Switch and spey lines are rated very differently. A 6wt switch/spey line will be comparable to an 8 or 9wt single hand line typically. The Tapers are also vastly different.   If you line it up and learn the proper casts (very different from single hand fishing) you can expect good casts of 70' or so.
flyfishing,39u0g5,beer_engineer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:49:54 2015 UTC,"in addition, there are very few instances where you are going to be able to effectively fish a 100' cast"
flyfishing,39u0g5,alextron,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:52:21 2015 UTC,There is that too.  Nearly all my swung steelhead (and this number is in the 100+ fish range.  Have been on casts of about 50-60' and shorter.  Many in the 30' range.

flyfishing,39u0g5,alextron,2,Mon Jun 15 06:05:02 2015 UTC,"Yea, a fly rod is not a magical cure all that you can throw money at and expect to solve all your problems.   First things first you need to do more research on your lines. A fly line plays a bigger part to your casting and fishing than the rod does so going out and paying 20 bucks on a shit line that isn't suited for the rod at all was a huge mistake. Sorry for being blunt but thats the issue here.   If you want a good combo, get a line that was actually made for that rod. If you want long distance, get a short head scandi or skagit style line. You'll lose any ability to mend, but thats what you sacrifice for a longer cast."
flyfishing,39u0g5,_iFish,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:16:46 2015 UTC,"Well that's the thing, I haven't spent any money on line yet. But what I'm gathering is the line is the issue. I guess I was surprised at how poorly regular line that I already had worked, or didn't."
flyfishing,39u0g5,beer_engineer,3,Sun Jun 14 23:46:54 2015 UTC,"On that note, though, don't expect things to be instantly fixed when you do get the right line.  Two handed casting is something that takes a very long time to get good at.  It's absolutely nothing like the casting you've been doing to this point.  If anything, having previous casting experience may make it tougher because you'll have habits that will be detrimental to two handed casting success.  Lessons, online videos, and a lot of practice will get you there."

flyfishing,39u87a,arise_chckn,3,Sun Jun 14 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"Match your line to the rod, not the reel.  The reel might be a little heavy for the rod making it feel unbalanced, but going up a weight in line isn't going to fix that."

flyfishing,39u87a,CheebaHJones,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:37:07 2015 UTC,In my experience the reel weight rating is just going to change the balance of the rod.   I have a sage one 4wt and I prefer the feel of the 3/4 reel over the 5/6 but have both loaded with 5wt line.   I prefer an overlined rod but the line weight and the reel size are only an issue if your line is heavy enough that it over fills the spool.

If you are frustrated with your lack of catching fish, just look at it tactically. Change the river, time of day, be more stealthy, change the presentation of the fly. Don't do the same thing over and over. Cast to fish you know are there, or have a high likelihood of being there.  Heck, even get a guide for a day so you can explore something new and enjoy yourself.  Don't quit!"

Hiked for 2 hours, almost got killed, hurt my legs and didn't even see any fish or promising water when I got to the stream.  Been fly fishing for a year now, going out fairly diligently. I've caught a total of two fish, both of which were not where I am right now, both of which were tiny little baby bass.

You should try looking at it from the enjoyment you get from the process. If you base your enjoyment and success on what you catch, you will have far more bad days fishing than good ones. As they say, it's about the journey, not the destination.   But good luck also, it does feel great when you do get one on the line, but that's always been a bonus for me."

flyfishing,39s5i5,neekoriss,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:02:23 2015 UTC,"You may find that your hookup rate is a little better with barbless hooks, because they enter with less resistance. Keep your rod tip up, work them in on the reel, and let your rod do the work of absorbing shock during the fight. Barbless hooks can also drastically reduce your release time on a landed fish.   As always, respect your fishery and follow the rules/laws applied to it. Stocked fisheries are hard to maintain, and if the local DNR feels that it's best to use barbless hooks when fishing certain rivers, it's best to comply.   On a personal note, this is a skill that takes years to master. If you've only been at it for a year, try to keep your head up. If you've never gone out with a guide or taken a casting lesson, give it some thought. Sometimes getting a second opinion can really help to give you perspectives that you might not have considered."

flyfishing,39r76u,howtocookawolf,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:25:26 2015 UTC,"I cut my teeth on the Caney back in college.  Would fish it three to four days a week and it was fairly common to go out and catch twenty good fish in an hour.   Then it shut down.  Seems like two or three years straight it was hard to catch ten fish in a day.  Maybe it was just me.  I don't know, but it sure was tough out there.  I drove over the river yesterday and there were at least ten guys fishing the rest area just past exit 268.  I couldn't believe it.  Texted my old fishing buddy and told him and he couldn't believe it either.  I hope those people and your picture are signs that the Caney Fork is fishing more like the glory days again!   Good looking fish!  I fish the Clinch almost exclusively now, so I don't have any tips on what to use out there these days, but back when I was always out there, I wouldn't put my waders on without a box full of size 18-20 tungsten bead head zebra midges in every color I could find.  Most productive colors were always black, olive, or white, except for a two week stretch where I used powder blue midges and absolutely slayed the fish!   Then that ended and I've never had that kind of luck with them again.   Other flies I wouldn't leave home without we're head head pheasant tails, copper johns, and a couple of colors of wooly buggers.   Best quality rainbows were always found in the Lancaster area.   Best browns at happy hollow.  If I wanted to catch a lot of fish (i.e. If I had someone with me who had never fished the river or fished at all) I'd just walk down the path below the dam.    So many good days on the Caney Fork.  It's good to see a lot of people out there again!"
flyfishing,39r76u,Gravaman007,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"The good news is that the Caney Fork remains a popular and productive fishery. Many anglers still fish there regularly. Happy hollow and Lancaster still generally are better for Browns and bows respectively. However, many fishermen report the same thing you have. After talking with the TWRA and other fisherman it's no secret what caused a decline in the fishery over the past 5 years. Namely, the TVA has upped their generation times and volume. This keeps the smaller fish from effectively feeding and growing. Additionally, the constant temperature drop from generation, especially in the spring, impedes hatches and essentially arrests the changing of the seasons. This disrupts the river's food chain and makes feeding more difficult for the trout. Many would argue that prolonged generation also allows the striped bass to run from the Cumberland all the way to the dam and hold there, gorging on trout. Having observed several fishermen catch large striper at the dam, I can attest to their presence there. This increased generation is apparently driven by two factors: an increased energy demand from the surrounding area, and a multi million dollar dam repair project that was finished this year. According to a TWRA biologist, we should see less generation in the coming years now that the project is complete. The final schedule will always be dictated by the TVA who's priority  isnt (and shouldn't really be) fishing. The best I can tell, in the 90s and 2000's the Caney was a hidden jewel, dense with healthy trout. Starting around 2009, generation schedules, drouts, and dam repair changed the face of the river through 2013 and now the river seems to be in a state of rebound, much like the Cumberland river in KY. Time will tell if my hypothesis holds true. But the signs point to a healthy and growing trout population."

There are plenty of fast running streams in the valleys which'll hold streamer-eating browns; stuff like muddler minnows n' whatnot. Otherwise, the higher and/or mountainous country holds some killer brook, rainbow, and even grayling waters. This is divvied up between the lakes and steams, so there's obviously the changing strategy there. Lake fish'll often take drakes in late june through july.

flyfishing,39o0lq,cabose4prez,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:24:33 2015 UTC,"This is my experience as well. A small creek up the road from me fishes the best about three days after a good rain. I've been keeping an eye on the flows and they have been crazy here in CO but if there's just the flash flood and then nothing else until you fish it you'll be fine. And even if it is a bit swollen and off color, just find the spots where the water slows down a bit, like the inside seem around a bend, and you'll be good."
flyfishing,39o0lq,jfred17,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"This is what ive been thinking but i have not actually experienced these conditions before.  Its a smaller (20-30 ft wide at its widest under normal conditions) freestone stream.  My plan was to fish the pools to target larger fish even before the flooding incident.  Also,the regional geology makes the water more turbid than fisheries im used to so im hopeful that the possibility of increased suspended sediment wont affect the fish's feeding habits.  Thanks for the input!"

Walks to streams can be a little sketchy and its nice to have both hands free. Additionally, when I go out in the water I'll tie the dog up to something, and the wide loop of the leash which normal fits my waist can be cinched down to the size of a small tree trunk, which is helpful. I'll typically pack a small piece of fabric/blanket for her to chill on. She's older and just likes to relax and watch me, so being leashed isn't a big deal.

flyfishing,39l7ra,Pones,2,Sat Jun 13 23:37:53 2015 UTC,"I use zinc stearate obtained from a chemical supply house.  It's a food-grade mold release that I believe is the principle ingredient in powdered floatants.  You can mix it with silica gel dessicant (easily obtained from craft shops) to dry and waterproof your fly at the same time.  Put the mixture in a small plastic vial and, when your fly won't float any more, stick it in the vial and shake for a bit.  Remove your fly, blow off the excess power, and you're good to go."
flyfishing,39l7ra,tomchou,2,Fri Jun 12 15:43:29 2015 UTC,There's an archery dessicant you can buy in bulk called Cab-o-Sil. It's fumed silica and it does the drying job.
flyfishing,39l7ra,Pones,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"That's the same stuff that is sold as Frog's Fanny; over here frog's Fanny is £7 a bottle. It would be great if I could get this stuff in bulk and refill myself, since I'm always forgetting to screw the cap back on!"
flyfishing,39l7ra,tomchou,2,Fri Jun 12 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"I swear by Frog's Fanny.  I'll go through two bottles a day when I'm on the water.  Fumed silica is also used as a boat epoxy.  You might find a local boat maker who will sell you some.  Here in the states, I buy it in bulk... literally a huge bag, which lasts me a few years, for $25US.  Also, you can buy it on eBay as well... maybe check and see if they'll ship it to you overseas."
flyfishing,39l7ra,Pones,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up, is cabosil the hydrophobic fumed silica? I think you can get hydrophobic or hydrophilic types, I'd obviously want the former."
flyfishing,39l7ra,tomchou,2,Sun Jun 14 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I believe it is.  When you get it, you can put it into the Frog's Fanny containers with a small kitchen funnel.  Once you start using it liberally out on the water, you can't go back.  I'm not sure if they'll ship to the UK, but check out: http://www.amazon.com/Cabosil-Aerosil-colloidal-silica-gallon/dp/B0047R2CSA  Tight lines!"
flyfishing,39l7ra,Pones,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:50:54 2015 UTC,"I've looked into this further, there's a UK supplier here: http://www.inoxia.co.uk/products/chemicals/inorganic-compounds/cab-o-sil I've gone for the TS-720 variant:   CAB-O-SIL TS-720 is Cabot's most hydrophobic treated fumed silica making it an excellent choice for moisture sensitive systems. Further the surface chemistry of TS-720 makes it very effective, stabile rheology control additive for polar systems. The hydrophobic TS-720 grade can be used in fly fishing for keeping flies dry and nail artists can use this grade to suspend glitters in clear top coats."
flyfishing,39l7ra,phriday613,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:39:45 2015 UTC,"Nice.  How much does it cost there in the UK? As a tip, I put the fumed silica into an old Gatorade or water bottle with a funnel, and use duct tape to keep it closed.  I've literally traveled all over the world with that in my bag, but I carry a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) with me in case I'm ever stopped in an airport.  From there, it's easy to transfer it from the big bottle to the little one with the appropriate size funnel."
flyfishing,39l7ra,BKonthefly,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"I got 0.5kg for about £20, floatant for life!  Thanks for the handling tips, I'll be doing something similar."
flyfishing,39mg2w,LawyerDagget,3,Fri Jun 12 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"Fly fishing is about 4 things.    Where are the fish? When are they eating? What are they eating? How is what they are eating being presented to them?   As /u/TyroneFeldstein suggests, talk with a local shop about these 4 things.   Once you have some more knowledge, start applying what you've learned in these 4 areas. It takes time. And patience. Oh boy, does it ever take patience. It's ok to get skunked on multiple trips. It happens to everyone. I fish mostly rivers and streams because I feel like flowing water makes up for a lot of my errors in presentation. Open and still bodies of waters (Lakes/resevoirs) are, in my opinion, more difficult because often the fish are deeper. Do you have proper sinking line? Is your fly so heavy that its cannonballs into the water, scaring fish away before you can even attract them? Are you letting the line load behind you to provide a smoother cast and presentation on top of the water?"
flyfishing,39mg2w,WhoBeCreepin,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:22:41 2015 UTC,I use the Rio mainstream bass line...All the videos I can find online it seems like on lakes and reservoirs people are fishing from boats and then from shore for ponds and the like.  My casting isn't awesome right now but then again I am still getting used to the new rod. I haven't even gotten a nibble on anything. I have been targeting bass for a few hours then when after I have had enough of nothing happening I switch over to my 2wt and slay blue gills.
flyfishing,39mg2w,TyroneFeldstein,2,Fri Jun 12 20:48:18 2015 UTC,Could be a lot of things? I'd suggest talking to a local that fishes the same spots.
flyfishing,39mg2w,cabose4prez,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"No fly shops here (Bismarck,ND). If I track down a bait fisherman would the advice still be useful or is bait fishing for bass going to be totally different then using flies?"
flyfishing,39mg2w,TyroneFeldstein,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:42:37 2015 UTC,It will be different but that doesn't mean it won't be helpful.
flyfishing,39mg2w,getgnar,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:12:32 2015 UTC,I'd look for a local fishing forum as well - here in Ohio our DNR maintains one; very helpful for local info.
flyfishing,39mg2w,mattsfishingfortrout,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:06:57 2015 UTC,"Usually I expect to struggle when I go to a place the first few times. You just need to figure out where the fish are and what presentation they like. Sounds like you're using the right flies. Also having confidence is really important. If you fish like you won't catch a fish, you won't. Believe, or at least pretend to! But yeah, struggling at a new spot is typical. And if it's your first time bass fishing, that would further explain it."
flyfishing,39mg2w,djvanillaface,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:36:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks,confidence definitely drops after the first couple hours of nothing."
flyfishing,39mg2w,djvanillaface,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:49:23 2015 UTC,"Welcome to flyfishing. I too struggle with lakes. I have sinking lines, i throw wollies.. nada. Its called fishing, not catching so on the days you fish always take what you did wrong and work on it. And on the days your slaying it, you wont remeber the days fishing. Its a love hate relationship. I myself have been on a 5 day skunk fest myself. Got skunked fishing for pike on the rio grande,got skunked for trout in creede, got skunked on the taylor twice and got skunked at bluewater going for muskies. It happens, looking forward to the 40+ Days on my small streams here soon."
flyfishing,39mg2w,Lazerbunnyfuntime,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:06:46 2015 UTC,"I also have a difficult time with bass fishing and I tend to catch them when I least expect it (fishing for bluegills). Do you bass fish this area with conventional tackle? If so, what do you use? If they hit crank baits, try a deceiver or clouser or something else like this. Maybe try bigger flies with more movement (articulated or with fur)? It could also be something with your retrieve. Do you switch it up?"

flyfishing,39ksmy,HAWG,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:08:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for making this!
flyfishing,39ld0w,fishbummin27514,5,Fri Jun 12 15:19:56 2015 UTC,"Mine requires coals from a fire but other then that its pretty simple. I'll filet the fish but I will leave the skin on. I place each filet on a large piece of foil and season them with salt, pepper, a little bit cayenne pepper, and lemon juice. Depending how big the filets are I usually add 1-2 tbsp of butter and slices of lemon to the top of the filets. Then I wrap them in the foil and place them in some coals and making sure they are covered on all sides. I usually cook them for 10 minutes. Usually turns out pretty well."
flyfishing,39ld0w,kellenmo,2,Fri Jun 12 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty much exactly how I do it too."
flyfishing,39ld0w,Misanthraloper,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:52:10 2015 UTC,Same.
flyfishing,39ld0w,randomasfuuck27,2,Fri Jun 12 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"I know my favorite way to cook a fish at camp, but I want to hear yours.   Uhh... so what is it?"
flyfishing,39ld0w,trigon,2,Fri Jun 12 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"Get some lemon slices, cajun seasoning, butter, and some white onions. Gut out the fish, chop the head off, put cajun seasoning and lemon in the cavity, put a bunch of cajun seasoning on the skin, chop onions in larger peices and put on the skin, put butter on top of fish, wrap everything in tinfoil, put on the coals of your fire pit at camp for like 6-7 minutes each side (depending on the size of the fish) and boom you have one of the best meals of your life guaranteed, even if you don't love fish that much. I guess I should have put this up earlier hehe"
flyfishing,39ld0w,trigon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"Nice. I do something very similar.   I leave the head on (although in retrospect not sure why. Probably laziness) Gut it and rub salt and pepper. Generally the fish has enough oil/fat on it so I don't add butter, but I'm certainly not one to judge. Stuff it with lemon, garlic, and whatever herbs (usually flat leaf parsley). Wrap in parchment paper and leave near the fire.    This version is more of a ""roast"" while yours is more of a ""poach"". Obviously this is all tertiary to the company and beers."
flyfishing,39ld0w,necropaw,2,Fri Jun 12 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"Oh yea I forgot garlic too! Hehe and of course you have to have a beer, to me I almost look forward more to the hangin around the fire with the guys, throwin back a few than I do the fishing....almost"
flyfishing,39ld0w,BeastroMath,2,Fri Jun 12 20:03:28 2015 UTC,"I dont really do the camping thing for trout fishing (we have our camper parked on some land a couple miles from the river, but that doesnt count lol).  I pretty much cook my trout the same way every time though.  tiny bit of salt and pepper in the cavity (sometimes i skip that) and pan fry em on lower heat to prevent the skin from searing to the meat.  Thats the beauty of cooking trout.  They really dont need anything extra, theyre tasty enough to start with (at least wild ones)"
flyfishing,39ld0w,3rdIQ,2,Fri Jun 12 15:42:50 2015 UTC,"For the little guys I toss em in a mixture of cornflower and lemon pepper and fry til crispy in butter.  Stick a fork in the filet at the base of the tail and peel off the filet.  Repeat on otherside to have 2 perfect boneless filets.  Eat with ritz crackers. Seriously, you will be one happy camper."
flyfishing,39ktja,MG92Silverado,3,Fri Jun 12 12:45:35 2015 UTC,"You live in a good spot for fly fishing.  If you live in asheville check out Hunter Banks or Davidson river outfitters. Tell they what you want to start out catching, and they can point you in the direction of what flies to buy. If you live in the boone area, there is the Foscoe Fly shop, or Appalachian Angler or something like that."
flyfishing,39ktja,HAWG,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:18:27 2015 UTC,I actually live in the Asheville area. I don't really know what I want to focus on catching. I've fished some streams and rivers around here a little (more of a lake fisherman) and caught mainly small trout and small mouth bass.
flyfishing,39ktja,HAWG,2,Fri Jun 12 15:15:50 2015 UTC,There will be some overlap between small mouth and trout. So you wont have to have tons of different flies for each.
flyfishing,39ktja,cabose4prez,2,Fri Jun 12 15:32:01 2015 UTC,Need to know what you will be fishing for
flyfishing,39ktja,cabose4prez,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:01:58 2015 UTC,I've dished streams and rivers around here a little and caught smaller trout and small mouth bass. I've also caught some bream. I guess I'd focus on catching those species.
flyfishing,39ktja,ces614,2,Fri Jun 12 15:17:03 2015 UTC,"Buggers will get you both smallmouth and trout, large nymphs can do the same. As the nymphs get smaller the more trout specific they will become. Add some clouser minnows for smallies or big trout.  Midges are another necessary pattern for trout, they won't overlap to much at least from my experience."
flyfishing,39ktja,ces614,3,Fri Jun 12 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly don't even worry about flies that much. Most trout food is 3/4 of an inch long and either brown or grey (eh maybe also black). A few flies like that and a few attractors and you will be golden. The thing to focus on is getting a fly in front of a trout without scaring the living shit out of it. That entails a couple of things. First figuring out where that fishy might be ( pro tip: think cover, oxygen and food!), second approaching that area with the least disturbance possible. And finally putting the fly in front of it at the depth of the water column where the fish is most likely to be feeding at the moment. So back to your fly selection. The type is less important than how a particular fly, leader, and cast interact with the water depth and speed. You will probably want a few dry flies for when they are at or near the surface. Some nymphs that are weighted and some that are not and some streamer/attractor flies ( a wooly bugger is a must have in this category). You are going to have a blast learning about the fishes, the streams (lakes, whatever), the gear and how it all works together! Take it slow, enjoy the process and the outdoors and Good Luck!"
flyfishing,39ktja,FastEddieMcclintock,2,Fri Jun 12 16:46:28 2015 UTC,Wow. Thank you very much! A guy from work is actually gonna take me fly fishing Monday for my first time. I'm super excited.
flyfishing,39jjnk,pukesickle,11,Fri Jun 12 04:15:10 2015 UTC,"Don't leave trash and shit lying around. No matter where I'm fishing, every single time, literally, I've picked up a good chunk of fishing line from the bank. It's not hard to not litter."
flyfishing,39jjnk,Cradd710,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:45:46 2015 UTC,Agreed. I try to bring a bag with me for all of the shit I see in/around the crowded streams near NYC
flyfishing,39jjnk,BKonthefly,8,Sun Jun 14 02:26:57 2015 UTC,"Don't jump in front of or crowd other fishermen. Give people space. Here in the driftless, 1/2 mile is good. Be friendly. Talk and coordinate what would be an acceptable proximity.  Walking for 15 minutes won't kill you."
flyfishing,39jjnk,homebrewerdude,5,Fri Jun 12 13:23:50 2015 UTC,"I was steel heading a few days after opener and walked a good hour or two down stream to try and avoid the crowds, fishing a nice little swift that was stacked up with fish, then drifting down into a pool at the base. hooked up on a good fish almost snapped my 5wt :P. while I was attempting to land this beast of a fish, another angler that I had previously passed up stream strolls up and starts drifting less than 5 feet away from me exactly where I was previously casting, doesn't even say a word. needless to say I was not impressed. How someone can think that is acceptable is beyond me."
flyfishing,39jjnk,Motorhead8333,4,Fri Jun 12 16:12:52 2015 UTC,"That'll happen in just about any crowded area.  If someone sees you hook a fish, expect your spot to get poached while you land the fish."
flyfishing,39jjnk,beer_engineer,2,Fri Jun 12 16:37:50 2015 UTC,Steelheading; 10% of the Anglers catch 90% of the fish. Just cover more water than them and if you know what water to look for and how to effectively fish it you'll catch more fish. Might want to upsize that 5wt. though.
flyfishing,39jjnk,Elevationtest,3,Mon Jun 15 07:55:19 2015 UTC,"Talk and coordinate what would be an acceptable proximity.   This is great... communication can clear up a potential faux pas. GF and I popped out of the woods after a hike to what we thought would be our own stretch of river. But there was a fisherman walking down the other bank in the direction we were gonna go. We waded across some shallows to him and the three of us came up with a game plan... he even invited us to the pools he was headed to, but we told him to take them for himself and we'd hit them later in the day. Good vibes."
flyfishing,39jjnk,pantsthemusical,7,Fri Jun 12 18:01:18 2015 UTC,"Say hello to people who say hello to you. Not sure how it is in other parts of the country, but Northeast anglers can be some serious grumps. Maybe it's the Northeast city vibe where people don't interact on the street. But we're not in the city. Loosen up."
flyfishing,39jjnk,pantsthemusical,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:57:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Sometime's I'm a little grumpy after driving for three hours, only to find another car at my favourite spot, but my grouchiness is instantly defused with a little small talk. Also, some fisher people ascribe to the 'self-sufficient' solitary type, which can hamper the initial interaction a little.  On a somewhat related note, I was recently in a potentially dangerous situation when a sudden hail storm closed into a fairly inaccessible valley - knowing who and where the others were offered some assurance that everyone got out OK."
flyfishing,39jjnk,smersk,5,Fri Jun 12 22:55:52 2015 UTC,"This doesn't seem to be the case everywhere, but it definitely is on most rivers here in the NW (especially steelhead rivers).  If someone is in a run, don't step in below them.  Start upstream of them.  Most steelhead anglers (at least the ones who know what they're doing) are moving down a step or two each cast.  It's good form to fish behind them, not cork them off."
flyfishing,39jjnk,beer_engineer,2,Fri Jun 12 12:51:58 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming when you are fishing in the PNW, you are doing a lot of swinging, is this why?"
flyfishing,39jjnk,cabose4prez,2,Fri Jun 12 13:04:44 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if you're swinging, nymphing, spooning, drifting bait, etc. It's the accepted method unless it's a combat zone like a hatchery stretch."
flyfishing,39jjnk,beer_engineer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:22:20 2015 UTC,"So what do you do when you get to the end of the stretch, move to a new spot and assume nothing or repeat? Or  both"
flyfishing,39jjnk,cabose4prez,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:50:22 2015 UTC,"If I'm on foot, sometimes I'll change things up and go back to the top.  If I'm in a boat, I'll usually move on to the next run.  But that answer can change based on a number of factors."
flyfishing,39jjnk,beer_engineer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:36:27 2015 UTC,That sounds reasonable enough
flyfishing,39jjnk,cabose4prez,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"Don't Low hole me! Also, if you fence post I will fish right through you."
flyfishing,39jjnk,Elevationtest,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:57:27 2015 UTC,"In comparison if someone is working upstream do not jump in upstream of them. Give them a decent amount of space to work up, they were there first. This is my single biggest annoyance when fishing in comparatively busy stretches. I could be spending a decent amount of time slowly stalking up to a rising fish and some dickwad steps in the river immediately above me and fucks it all up."
flyfishing,39jjnk,DampRice,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:59:53 2015 UTC,"In steelhead fishing, if someone is working upstream, they typically don't know what they're doing. I usually chat with them and explain the situation.  Because working upstream on a steelhead run is not only bad technique, it's also bad etiquette to other anglers."
flyfishing,39jjnk,beer_engineer,5,Fri Jun 12 14:21:15 2015 UTC,"I leave the city to get away from the city - I don't need to be reminded of it when I'm not there: don't leave trash or butts and turn the fucking stereo off. If you have bag and size limits, don't keep fish live so that you can cherry-pick a trophy to take home at the end of the day. I know this is acceptable in many place, particularly outside of the fly fishing community, but in stressed catchments, I just find it selfish and kind of rude. Don't piss in the river - I know it's akin to a drop in the ocean, but I just don't need the thought of it being filtered through the gills of my dinner.  Don't spook fish by being careless or intrusive. Avoid clumsy casts near others and be aware of long shadows in the afternoon. If I've just come home from a long and fruitless day, don't ask me if I caught anything. Finally, do tell people where the fish aren't."
flyfishing,39jjnk,smersk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:24:13 2015 UTC,"Hahaha this is hilarious, but as any good fisherman knows you always ask your buddy what he caught, thats half the fun. Couldn't agree more with everything else, except for the pissing in the river, I try to avoid it but am guilty. Just think of all the deer, bear, beaver, bird, and fish that use that river.....mmmmmm flavoring!"

flyfishing,39is6n,Haroldie,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:29:26 2015 UTC,That will catch fish just fine. The only thing I might add is a bead or a darker head. Fish seem to key on a distinctive head. You might also try this exact pattern but with 2-3 strands of  krystal flash along the body. It seems to add motion as it moves through the water. Great effort!

flyfishing,39hewx,the_driftless,2,Thu Jun 11 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"Kind of a strange setup honestly, I don't own the full king arrangement.    I was fishing a 9' 10 wt TFO with an Echo Ion 10/12 wt reel.  Instead of using a normal 10 wt line, I was fishing  a 525 grain skagit head that I usually use on my 7 wt spey rod.  Attached to that was a 8' section of T-14 sink tip.  Instead of using the normal 10 wt line, I opted for the skagit head because I am pretty decent at single hand spey techniques.  I would fish the line about 2/3 of the way out of the rod and use the heavier skagit head to generate enough load to turnover my sink tip and very heavy fly.  It's kind of a non-standard way of fishing, but the water we were fishing is quite deep but only about 30 ft wide where the fish hold so a 14' two hander is both overkill for the area we were fishing and out of my price range for the moment, anyway.  Even if you don't know how to single hand spey, the skagit head greatly increases your ability to roll cast and turnover heavy sink tips and flies. My two cents."

Tyee is less common and more of regionally specific name (Washington and southwest British Columbia).  You also hear some more specific names like June hawgs and upriver brights in the Columbia drainage.  Chinook and Kings though, are pretty much universal across their range.  That said, biologists will always call them Chinook in a professional context.  Which is funny I say that because I call them Kings in the title, but have been working on a ""juvenile Chinook"" in interior Alaska project of late."

flyfishing,39gj6i,Bobbz,18,Thu Jun 11 15:54:46 2015 UTC,"Hooking the fish is one concern, but how you handle and release the fish has more potential in damaging or stressing the fish.   Too many times I see in this sub a trout laying in the dirt or on a rock next to the fly rod for scale.     Also, in videos seeing a fight going on way longer than necessary, over exhausting the fish and/or not releasing the fish by making sure you've help it recovery by getting water moving through its gills.     And finally, not wetting your hands before you handle the fish.     OK, I'm over it."
flyfishing,39gj6i,Bartman4444,3,Thu Jun 11 17:39:06 2015 UTC,This. There are way to many photos where aren't respecting the fish. I usually try and take one photo of the fish in my net then a quick one of me holding it then immediately put it back in the water.
flyfishing,39gj6i,kellenmo,4,Thu Jun 11 18:00:44 2015 UTC,"I have actually looked into studies of harming fish while catching them and handling them. What I have read in about 4 studies is that handling a fish out of water in a respectful way, holding them up take a picture, and return the fish in a reasonable time, less then two min is not linked to more casualties.  Laying them in the dirt or grass may remove more protective ""slime"" but that slime is replaceable.  What is harmful to the fish is hook set and placement. This is where fish casualties happen. If the fish is hooked in the mouth near the lips that's the best you can do, if it's a deeper hook set then the likelihood of the fish dying is greater.  In other words, treat fish with respect and do your best to set the hook quickly. As for handling don't worry too much about harming the fish, just treat with care."
flyfishing,39gj6i,Grooty15,3,Fri Jun 12 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"This is the reason why I don't have any pictures of a lot of trout I catch, the extra stress on the fish just isn't worth bragging rights."

flyfishing,39gj6i,HAWG,3,Thu Jun 11 18:22:34 2015 UTC,When i tie my flies I like to pinch down the barb by placing the hook side ways into the vise and giving a quick pinch. There are pliers out there that do the same thing. I find the smooth pliers easy to use when pinching the barbs down.
flyfishing,39gj6i,TheRGL,3,Thu Jun 11 18:46:59 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what the best way is but I just use a set of needle nose plyers and push it down that way so the barb is flush with the rest of the hook. I have only broken one hook doing this but to be fair I probably pushed the barb down too hard.
flyfishing,39gj6i,Pones,2,Thu Jun 11 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"Ideally, buy barbless hooks if tying your own, if not a file/hook sharpener will quickly remove a micro barb. Failing that crush it with some pliers/forceps."
flyfishing,39gj6i,ces614,2,Thu Jun 11 19:42:13 2015 UTC,"In addition to the great tips already posted, I also like to use a small hook hone and pass it over the area where I pinched the barb down. It smooths it out and sharpens the point at the same time. I find they rarely come unbuttoned and they actually hook up a bit easier with the sharpened point. Also if I want to unhook them without lifting them from the water I can usually just leave a little slack in the line and give it a shake, or grab the eye of the hook with my forceps and give it a twist. That way I don't even have to touch the fish..."

flyfishing,39gj6i,EuroNymphGuy,6,Thu Jun 11 23:58:11 2015 UTC,"My honest 2 cents: this is a predator sport. Here is what anglers do:   Dupe trout with feathers and steel Jam a hook in their mouths Traumatize them as as they bolt around in a complete frenzy Cause their heart rates to go through the roof, as lactic acid builds up and can, ultimately, kill the fish Foul-hook them by accident, at times And, for most people, we are doing this for fun, not to put food on the table   So, for me, I became 100% C&R for many reasons, one of which is, to be honest, guilt.   I am also aggressively playing fish, pushing my hardware to the max and not caring about losing fish, to shorten the stress on the trout.  Recently, have gone barbless.  Last, I gave up bait fishing many, many years ago. Hooking them very deep really bummed me out."
flyfishing,39gj6i,ces614,10,Thu Jun 11 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"You know after 50 years of fishing (mostly catch and release) I began having the same issue but when I had been fishing the same little creek about 15 years ago I noticed an interesting effect. The more I fished it the smarter the trout became and the bigger they got. So in effect I was educating the trout about the evils of the bugs that weren't really bugs. Anyhow I think that the benefit for the fish outweighed a bit of inconvenience for them :-) I also spend a great deal of time on the water and after reporting poachers over and over again, the word seems to have gotten out that the creek isn't their private meat locker.  So I guess that all in all my fishing does more good than harm and I think that that is good enough for me :-)"

flyfishing,39gj6i,ruskeeblue,4,Thu Jun 11 17:02:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know many bait fishermen that care, but most fly-fishermen definitely care about how much harm they are doing to a fish.  As far as types of fishing go, fly-fishing is one of, if not the least, harmful methods to catch a fish. Tiny hooks on most flies don't do much to hurt a fish's mouth, and you can make it even easier on the fish by crimping the barbs on your hooks.  However, once the fish is caught, you should try to handle it with as much care as possible. That can be the most damaging time for a fish. Only handle it with wet, bare hands, and try to keep it in the water as much as possible before releasing it."

flyfishing,39gj6i,wpauley608,4,Thu Jun 11 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"This is highly contested.  In a good portion of ecosystems, DNR/DWR is asking people to take home more fish, especially in stocked areas. In a lot of situations, if people are taking this C&R only mentality, some rivers can become overcrowded with fish that will not grow to reach their potential (Middle Provo is 2 fish under 15 inches, and some other Utah waters have a Brook Trout bonus bumping to 4 fish if 2 are brookies).    What's wrong with taking some to eat, because A. thats how fishing started, B. trout is good, and C. providing food that I foraged for myself is more rewarding and generally I can guarantee they will be better and more humanely treated than farm raised fish."
flyfishing,39gj6i,fishbummin27514,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:21:49 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right that taking fish to eat is beneficial to the population and the likelihood that the fish will grow to their full potential. But if you're going to eat fish, especially bass or a more popular sport-fish that isn't necessarily as good tasting as other fish, take the small to mid size fish as they are a) better and b) the amount of smaller fish far exceed that of bigger. Leave the bigger fish for other people to catch. Who knows, maybe that big one you let back will be caught by some kid on his first fishing trip and that could make the difference for said kid becoming and avid fisherman when he grows up."
flyfishing,39gj6i,so_there_i_was,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:57:01 2015 UTC,"Prime example. The Lower Provo in Utah which is a blue ribbon fishery has signs literally all over the place asking anglers to keep a few brown trout every trip. Reason being over population and lack of predation. Eventually you get to a tipping point where either fish begin to starve or disease begins due to over population (think whirling disease). I agree try to avoid taking big spwaning females and males during respective spawning seasons, but if you catch a fish of a lifetime I have no problem keeping it for a mount. But remember the bigger a trout gets the less firm the meat, really anything over 17 inches in my book just doesn't taste very good, and really 14 to 15 inches is prime time. Get some lemon slices, cajun seasoning, butter, and some white onions, gut out the fish, chop the head off, put cajun seasoning and lemon in the cavity, put a bunch of cajun seasoning on the skin, chop onions in larger peices and put on the skin, put butter on top of fish, wrap everything in tinfoil, put on the coals of your fire pit at camp for like 7 minutes each side (depending on the size of the fish) and boom you have one of the best meals of your life guaranteed, even if you don't love fish that much."

flyfishing,39gj6i,rockstang,2,Thu Jun 11 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"There is tons of information out there on properly handling fish. Fly fishing is one of the less invasive forms of fishing due to its smaller hooks, but one still needs to properly care and revive the fish once caught. Handling fish with bare, wet hands is important for the fish's health. If you have a net, once netted, allow the fish to revive a bit before removing from the water. There is a reason people say ""Keep em wet"", the less time a fish is out of the water, the better condition you will be releasing it in. Taking care of the fish and their environments is an important part of fishing."
flyfishing,39gj6i,fishbummin27514,2,Thu Jun 11 17:15:27 2015 UTC,i dont often keep fish anymore but i will keep one to eat every so often.  ive taken to piercing their organs with a knife right when i catch them for two reasons.  1 the meat is preserved a little bit better and 2 it is more ethical than running a string through. however it is really tough to do.  i think this is why i dont keep as many anymore.  actually killing it compared to watching it slowly die is a lot harder than you might think.
flyfishing,39gj6i,rockstang,3,Thu Jun 11 17:27:14 2015 UTC,"Dude piercing organs? Haha just cut through the top of the fish right behind the head, spinal cord severed no pain, instant death. By far the most humane way to kill a fish in my opinion. I am about 98% CR but have no problem taking a few brookies or rainbows to the camp while I am on a trip. Generally I don't eat Cutthroat or browns, and I wont eat a southern strain app brookie either. But you also have to remember fish don't feel pain the same way a human does. They have done tests on this where they introduced a chemical into a fishes nervous system that would have humans crunched over rocking back and forth screaming for someone to kill them, fish didn't flinch. The jumping and things you see are associated with a fight response similar to our gag reflex, well thats what they think anyways. I am sure that it doesn't feel good but remember fish don't feel the same way we do. Also what everyone else says on here. Handle properly, go barbless, don't fight too long. All good practices. Basically treat the fish with respect and I always like to think about it this way, I can hold my breath for like a minute before I start to panic, so think of a fish and say to yourself would I like to not breathe for that long? If the answer is no its time to put her back in the water."

Lactic acid accumulation prevents the fish from swimming normally, which makes it a target for predators.  •Help protect the trout’s slime coating by not handling the fish at all, if possible. If handling is necessary for whatever reason, it should only be done after completely wetting your hands. Handling should be kept to an absolute minimum. Please, don’t grasp the trout with a towel. And never drag a fish up on the shore. This is particularly important in alkaline lakes where a heavy coating of slime is necessary to protect the fish. •Keeping a trout out of the water is like keeping a human under water; breathing is impossible. The less time a trout stays out of the water, the better its chances for post-release survival. Lactic acid increases as a fish is deprived of oxygen when it is taken out of the water. Extreme levels of lactic acid will cause paralysis. So limit the time that a fish is out of water to a maximum of 20 seconds or so. •Once the hook is removed from the trout’s lip, gently cradle the trout underwater facing upstream. Allow the trout a few moments to collect its’ thoughts, lose some lactic acid, and regain equilibrium. Once the trout has recovered, it will swim away from you faster than a car thief running from the cops.  While those are the four most basic items to understand, there are other considerations and “helps” for a successful release. •If catch and release is the goal, pinching down the barbs on your hooks makes removal much easier. My personal experience is that if I keep a bend in the rod and tension on the fish, barbless hooks lose no more fish than barbed. •The slime coating is further protected by using the newer style, rubber nets now on the market. The older nylon nets are very hard on the fish. Next time you need to pick out a net, look for one that is made for C&R. •The use of forceps or hemostats is helpful in securing the hook and removing it without damaging the fish’s mouth. •If a fish is hooked deeply, the best idea is to simply snip the leader close to the mouth, rather than attempting to use a disgorger or pulling the hook free. •“Lipping” trout is very harmful, as the bones of their lips and mouth are fragile. They cannot be handled like a bass or with a Boga type tool. Holding a large trout vertically from the lower lip can damage the narrow isthmus area at the bottom of the gills. If you want to lift a fish for a picture, grasp the fish in front of the tail and under the belly to support the weight as evenly as possible. •The best way to weigh a fish is to lift it in a net. Weight the net with the fish and then subtract the weight of the net alone. •Avoid getting your fingers anywhere inside the gill plate. The least disturbance of the gills can kill a trout in a few hours, even though it looked fine swimming away from you. •Trout caught while fishing deep in lakes suffer from barotrauma (the bends) when brought to the surface. These fish must be released as soon as possible in order to improve survival. If the fish appears bloated and can’t swim back down by itself, it is best to use a descender weight with a clip or barbless hook to return the fish to depth quickly. Recent studies have found that deflating trout with a needle is a bad idea."
flyfishing,39gj6i,Jumping_Koalas,2,Thu Jun 11 21:15:24 2015 UTC,"I think they have proven that fish feel pain but not in the same way we as humans think about pain. Fish do have a nervous system thus they have capacity for pain, but because their brains are so simple it doesn't register in the same way like its just stored as an unpleasant experience not as a painful one. This is why big old fish are generally ""smarter"" because they have experienced negative interactions with either predators or hooks. Thus making them harder to catch. At least that's what I remember reading. But you are right about everything else. People think that jumping and fighting is associated with pain but it is actually an evolutionary fight response to having something stuck in their throats. Thats why you see fish randomly jump sometimes."
flyfishing,39gj6i,FarNorth22,2,Fri Jun 12 14:52:13 2015 UTC,"There have been studies on this, and they have found that the fish's metabolism returns to normal after 3 hours. They get stressed out during the fight, and contrary to what another poster said, fish do feel pain. That being said, there are ways to reduce stress, and increase the likelihood of survival.  The best thing to do is bring the fish in as quickly as possible, wet your hands before handling the fish, remove the hook as quickly as possible, and return the fish to the water as quickly as possible. Fish can breathe, albeit very shallow, when out of water, so it's not exactly like putting a human under water, but they can't live forever breathing atmospheric air, so get that fish back on the water. Fly fishing is a great technique for fish capture if you're worried about catch and release. When fly fishing, the fish rarely swallow the fly, it usually catches the fish in the corner of the mouth. Using bait like salmon eggs or power bait usually results in the fish swallowing the hook, resulting in high mortality rates. Hope this helps, enjoy fishing and know that practicing catch and release has great benefits to your sportfish populations."
flyfishing,39gj6i,ecski,2,Fri Jun 12 03:16:39 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna get down voted into oblivion for this, but as long as the fish stays off of the rocks/ground and the hook is removed quickly, the fish will be fine. In my experience, releasing the fish ASAP after a fight isn't always the best choice. These fish used up the entirety of their energy, hold them gently underwater and facing upstream and let them regain their bearings/energy. If there's no current, move the fish forward and backwards to get their gills engaged. Finally, when a fish is ready to be released, they will tell you."
flyfishing,39gj6i,RiverSnob,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:35:23 2015 UTC,I've been told to only move the fish forward through the water. Moving it backwards can be very damaging to the gills. I believe it is because water is not supposed to flow that direction.
flyfishing,39gj6i,lesjieblue,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:12:53 2015 UTC,"The biggest hurdle is realizing that fishing is inherently, historically, and still is a blood sport much akin to hunting.  Pressing barbs, responsible handling of fish, and accepting the fact that no matter what you do, how well you handle and treat the fish, some fish will die.  I had a few whitefish go belly up, but I revived them the other day.  Thinking back, I should have kept them and smoked them, but oh well."
flyfishing,39gj6i,wpauley608,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:16:59 2015 UTC,"Looking at the spiny and hard shelled pray most fish eat will tell you that a hook in the mouth most likely isn't felt. The mouths of most fish are boned and rough. I only C-P-R when it's a bigger sample of a species I caught. Meaning, I'm not taking a picture anymore of every fish I catch, only if it Topped my record. I keep a fishing log with sketches, that's where the memories are.

flyfishing,39ik6h,thefrankyg,3,Thu Jun 11 23:29:18 2015 UTC,"Best possible senario:  Go to youtube and learn to tie the following knots: surgeons knot (also called triple surgeons knot, triple water knot, triple overhand knot, Orvis knot, etc), and an improved clinch knot. These are the only two a beginner would need to know on the water. The rest can be done at home in front of a computer screen.   Youtube casting and practice practice practice. I hear from so many people that they watch all these videos and learn theory and go fish and can't cast for shit. Get to the park and forget fishing and just cast. 40 feet is a good bench mark. If you can consistently get a fly to 40 feet inside of a hula hoop, you're golden. I think people think they are silly waving it around in the park. I can cast pretty darn well if I can take that liberty and I'm in the park casting at least 5 or 6 times a year.   (if you plan on trout) Learn BASIC entomology. Just general lifecycles of the main food sources for trout. Orvis learning school (highly recommended) has a good video on this. Really, about 20 minutes is all you need.   After that, get a guide. At this point you'll have done most of what you can without someone else instructing you, and probably half of what the class would be. Hire a guide and specifically tell him/her that while fish would be cool, you want the one on one lessons. No classroom can teach you more than one on one on the water with a professional guide. If at all possible, have the guide take you to the water you plan on fishing the most.   IMHO that is the job of a good guide. Not paying someone to put you on fish and row you around all day, but someone who works hard to teach you how to do it yourself. Every guide realizes if someone wants to do it themselves, they can just fine. A good guide knows that rowing a boat and knowing where stupid fish live don't bring back good business. What they do know is that they have a vast knowledge of skills that they can teach you, and that you'll come back for lessons.   td;dr learn as much as you can at home, then hire a guide for on the water tutoring"
flyfishing,39ik6h,_iFish,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:11:08 2015 UTC,Would you recommend spending the 130+ on a decent fly rod during this practice time?
flyfishing,39ik6h,cabose4prez,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:41:56 2015 UTC,"What the other guys meant to say is its up to you. If 130 dollars is all you got go for it, if you need to go cheaper that's fine. My first setup was 100 and I still use it 5 years later as a primary setup.  If you practice with this rod I assume it will be your first one to fish with as well so buy accordingly to what you will be chasing.  As for the original question, YouTube is what I used to start out, you could also look at one of the free orvis classes, there may be room somewhere around you. On the orvis site their are some video instructions as well. Allenflyfishing has info under information resources on their site as well."
flyfishing,39ik6h,_iFish,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:17:46 2015 UTC,"Nope. Just about any fly rod (outside of maybe a fleugar or eagle claw) you can learn to cast on just fine. Most fish pretty darn well. The cheaper rods are usually better suited to learning on as well.   The problem is you're too green to know what will suit you best on the river. Maybe talk to the guide about where you'd like to fish and what you'd like to fish for. That, in combination with him being able to watch your casting habits, will allow him to make a good rod recommendation."
flyfishing,39ik6h,blatherdrift,-1,Fri Jun 12 22:59:08 2015 UTC,how do you know the rod is decent if you haven't fly fished before? The guided excursion might be good for you to get your hands on a properly set up rod.

Maybe reconsider in a year if by that time you aren't already ripping lips with friends or on your own. The best thing to do is teach yourself, use up all the wonderful and free resources. Buy a few books. Fly fishing can be a bit pricey to get into, but if you do it right, after you get a rod and reel its cheap.. I spend maybe $60 annually for local license and spools of tippet. Get minimal gear. No need for a vest and fancy shit, get a fanny pack, some toe nail clippers, hemostats, a knife, float goo, weights, spools of tippet, some spare leaders and an assortment of flies. Learn to tie flies, will save you hundreds of dollars. I recommend to research as much as you can and practice casting. Put in 50-100 hours of casting before you even tie a fly on. There are great how to videos for several variations of casts. Learn knots, I use pretty much three knots for everything, surgeon, blood, and modified clinch knot. Most of all have fun."

You could use a 6 or 7 wt probably for surf perch but if you tag into anything big you'll be praying for the bigger rod.

Stay in touch with the fly(no slack), and afterwards rinse all your gear thoroughly every time, if you want it to last."
flyfishing,39i93d,ob-com,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:53:57 2015 UTC,"Tides, tides, tides. 2 Hours before and after high tide are usually best but you can do well with lower tides as well. As long as water us moving you'll be good, slack tides are you're enemy. Youll want some orange, red or pink in your flys and always give your line time to sink. If you're not on the bottom when you're stripping back in you're not in the feeding zone.  Corbina are great for sight fishing but it requires some tact. I'd start by just looking for rip currents/structure and casting/stripping away.  Investigating the beach at low tide can give you some idea of the bottom structure during high tide but its constantly changing. Don't get discouraged early, bait fisherman will be hauling in catches around you.  Just keep at it and you'll learn how to read the water better, once that happens you'll be set. I used to catch surf perch, halibut, leopard sharks and guitar fish all on the fly from the surf.  Also, take that same rod out into the bays/harbors on a kayak with a olive/white clouser minnow.  Sand and Spotted bass hit those things like a ton of bricks and you'll have 20+ fish days easy if you're fishing the tides right.  Might even get a few Calico Bass which are always a nice treat. I used to just take my kayak to the top of the tidal rips and let the tide drift me down the harbor as I casted and stripped."

The bootie top that would normally fold down as a gravel gaiter can be flipped up to just below the knee which will get you deeper but still waterproof, and will keep you warmer.  Paired with convertible pants, I feel like I can hike for miles, bushwhack through nasty bankside stuff better than shorts, and still wade very comfortably.  It's early summer still, and I've only gone with this set-up twice, but I think it will solve all of the issues of stepping down from full waders/boots.  One you go over the sock, it's gonna be a bit squishy/squelchy, but still quite warm, and the Rip-rap shoe is a decent low-top hiker.  Edit: I have also used keens, and they will take  screw-in studs it you don't mind losing a few now and then. My problem with Keens is that they seem to let gravel in but then trap it underneath your foot.  Drives me nuts. The Rip-rap looks like it would take studs as well, but haven't tried it yet."

flyfishing,37rfkh,eppocalypse,4,Fri May 29 20:06:05 2015 UTC,"I too will be fishing in the B.C. interior this weekend.   Floating line is preferred in 20ft. or less of water, I usually run a 6-10ft. leader +anywhere from 4-10ft. of Fluro with a small ""bell"" swivel inbetween the leader and fluro to prevent tangles and knots. Don't use any split shot in 20ft. of water or less, your Chironies sink fine. Casting is a bit different if you're sitting in a boat or casting from a tube, more over the top I find but remember that there are really only 3 times to recast when indicator fishing stillwater; Checking your line/fly, Recast if line isn't mendable, After you've landed a fish. Keep your fly in the water, sit and wait until you catch your first fish, use red indicators as the green ones suck in overcast conditions. Chironomids hatch at many different depths (avg. 6-40ft.) depending on conditions, specifically the amount of light, water temp. and also depending on the ripple from the wind at times. By the time the Chironomids are dried on the surface and flying away, the hatch could be different. If your fly is productive this shouldn't really change your action much. Chironomids emerge from the mud on the bottom of the lake and swim to the surface to dry their wings and fly away. Fish will definitely notice your chironomid, however this is where a proper presentation loop can give you an advantage, especially if it's windy on the surface or if there is a lack of wind/ripple.   As a side note, if you notice ""bombers"" hatching (large chironomids), maybe try some larger fly sizes #12+ and be ready to have a good day of fishing.   That drop off off of the second island looks awesome to me, only problem you may have with this lake is that there doesn't seem to be too many places to get out of the wind so make sure your anchor(s) will hold you.   10-18ft. with a drop off is a good starting point for chironomidding.   Any marshes around the north end with a bit of inflow may be worth checking out. I would start around 10-12ft. depth near those drop offs and work your way from there. Fish jumping in from you a lot? try moving shallower. Keep catching dinker 16inchers? try moving a bit deeper where there are likely less active trout but potentially a lunker hanging around in the colder water.  Flies to start with; #12-20 sizing, come equipped with Green, Red, Brown, Black combinations. A good starting point for many lakes in the interior is small green as a ton of these lakes produce limies (super small green chronomids). Personal go to if you get it dialed in is Black with a red rib or red butt in sizes larger than 18, green/red butt to cover the bases.  Additional tips; Get a stomach pump and learn how to use it. The first few fish you catch (provided they're at least 14in. or so) pump their stomachs and whichever chironomids are still swimming/alive, match your fly to those as they are the most freshly hatched chironomids.  You can also Chironomid fish with a sinking line in 25-40ft. of water using no indicator, same principle with setting your fly in the lower water brackets. However, this method is typically less beginner friendly and you will likely land more fish with an indicator set up on a floating line.  Pinch your barbs, have some beers and your patience should pay off. Mayfly hatches are starting as well so be prepared for that, if Chironomid fishing isn't producing try trolling Darker coloured leeches in 15-40ft of water."

It was a successful weekend, landing several good ones in the 16 - 18"" range. I was the only one using chironomids on the lake by the looks of it. The first day is was a bit too windy, but Sunday morning was real nice. I did go to the north end and fished off the drop off with success. I only took a picture of the one fish I kept, I'll try to post it tomorrow!"
flyfishing,37rfkh,Elevationtest,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:43:45 2015 UTC,"Hey right on man, glad you had a good weekend and are so eager to learn. There are so so many successful, easily accessible lakes and many trophy lakes around Merritt, Kelowna, and Kamloops. I'm sure you already have a list going but I'm glad to help steer you in the direction of those smaller Trophy lakes with limited access (makes for some awesome photo opportunities) maybe just shoot me a PM.  Side note; Gwen lake was hot this weekend, and another lake near Roche lake provided some of the most consistent action that I've had all year so far.  Where are you based out of?"
flyfishing,37rfkh,lesjieblue,3,Mon Jun 1 07:28:58 2015 UTC,"dry fly line meaning ""floating line""?, If i go river nymphing i use airlock indicator with a tight line. If i go to lakes, I use dry fly + nymph (dry fly also serves as indicator, usually flies with parachute). Beaded goes down with out split shot. Tungsten bead goes down faster than brass. Maybe bring some sinking tips to go deeper. Dont use large indicators as they are heavy and make huge splashes harder to cast too if your on a lake.  if you need to make movements on your midges, move a very slow retrieve or let the wave move it for you and wait till your indicator sinks :) Fishes moves you got to find them. Bring micro leeches and zebra midges, killers in lakes as always.   My two cent, im no expert, that how i do it."
flyfishing,37rfkh,Aquapig,2,Fri May 29 21:06:35 2015 UTC,"In the UK a lot of fishing is done using patterns that imitate chronomids, which are normally called ""buzzers"" here. Indeed, looking at some resources from the UK on how to fish buzzers will probably answer most of your questions, although not all the techniques used here will be applicable to where you're fishing. However, I'll still try answer your questions as well as I can from my experience:   Chronomid patterns are normally very thin, and this profile allows them to sink very quickly, especially if they are coated with varnish (look up epoxy buzer patterns). I think weight is only needed if you're fishing very deep. I think it's normal to use very long leaders (up to 20 feet) with these patterns, often with three flies, which allows you to cover most of the water column using a floating line. You shouldn't need to use extra weight (see 1). If they are hatching, the larvae will be moving up the water column. You can imitate this using a slow figure of 8 retrieve interspersed with short periods of a quicker retrieve. If you can see fish moving on the surface, the better thing to do is put on a fly like a black cruncher which are jerked slowly just under the surface, and are very good when fish are feeding on emerging midges. As far as whether you've got them at the proper depth, from my limited (and possibly incorrect) knowledge of their life cycle, they will be on the bottom as bloodworms, and then move up the water column as buzzers. Probably best to use multiple patterns, with a bloodworm at the end and two buzzers on higher droppers. I dunno. The general advice is to fish over a drop off from the shallow water by the shore."
flyfishing,37rfkh,Aquapig,2,Sat May 30 19:53:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all the info! I wasn't able to land any fish on my 'black cruncher' when I gave it a go, though I did have a few strong hits that didn't stick. Still struggled with getting the depth right, but the buzzer definitely sank better than I thought it would. I used a swivel between the leader and the tippet. I was only fishing about 18 feet down at the most. I think a depth finder and a good anchor or two will be my next purchases."
flyfishing,37rfkh,cabose4prez,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:49:03 2015 UTC,"No problem! I'm glad it helped. Cruncher patterns always work ridiculously well for me.   To be honest, I would just use however long of tippet with no leader and put droppers onto that, although that can get expensive if you're going thorugh lots of tippet.   An anchor would be a good investment if you're going to continue with this kind of fishing, since the flies have to be pretty static. However, I would say, although I've never used a float tube, the benefit seems to be the ability to cover a lot of water compared to bank fishing, so you might want to consider types of fishing that suit that. Loch style wet-fly fishing fits well, and you can still use patterns that imitate emerging chronomids."

flyfishing,37czfc,fermenter85,2,Tue May 26 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"If you can get a flight to Bozeman, MT for under $1000, you should have no problem renting a car, finding affordable places to stay, and fishing plenty of public access water all over the most famous rivers in Montana. You could have similar experiences in Colorado, California, and Oregon (not an exclusive list, just the ones I'm most familiar with). You wouldn't need a guide for many rivers as long as you're a competent angler and relatively familiar with basic Western trout techniques (indicator nymphing, indicator less nymphing, hopper dropper). Fly selection and all that stuff can be found at local shops without too much trouble.   If you need guides (standard for trout guiding for most places is $400-475/day, American guides get tips in the range of $50-100 per day), your budget given the basic flight and rental car cost is probably pretty tight.  If you're thinking you want to do that, I personally would think about:   Southwestern Montana, maybe stay in a few towns but definitely spend time in/around Ennis. Northern California, base out of Burney Falls area, you might want a guide for a day or two here, or stay at an angler's lodge like Clearwater Lodge (you don't need to hire their guides to stay at the lodge, and your meals and accommodations would be awesome). Oregon, I would move around quite a bit but definitely work around the Deschutes Salmonfly hatch.    Honestly though, if you're a successful trout angler, you're probably not going to have drastically ""new"" experiences in most of these places. Part of the reason to go is to visit the classic waters that have become part of the sport's tradition. In general, if I were you I'd think about doing something like a more affordable saltwater trip to Caye Caulker in Belize or many of the places where you don't necessarily need to stay at an expensive angler's lodge and you might be able to get quite a bit of fishing with guides into your budget."

Anyone around you (friends/shops/etc) that can help out? You can literally be off by a size or two (using a #12 and they want a #16 (even in the same pattern!)) and not get a single take.

flyfishing,379m3f,dahuii22,3,Tue May 26 00:39:13 2015 UTC,"How is your presentstion?  Were you fishing lakes for the other species?  In rivers and streams, you really need to watch your drift.  The fly cannot drag slower than the current or move faster than the current.  Keep your tip higher with less line on the water.  Also try casting up stream behind a pool if possible.  In my opinion drift and drag are most important followed by fly size then color."

With the grass I am clueless and have been trying for a long time. I'm thinking the best way is to get the closest thing to algea or moss and patience but as of yet my pursuits have been fruitless. Good luck.

flyfishing,377mr4,rafthikefish,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:02:33 2015 UTC,"I cannot emphasize this enough -- please bring bear spray! My friend is a bear biologist in Yellowstone and the relatively mild winter in the Rocky Mountains is contributing to A LOT of bear activity in the Park early on. Every Grizzly I have ever seen in the park has been on the north side.  I think the northeast entrance will save you time. Probably not hours and hours, but it's smart to get their early to get a camping spot. The NE entrance should be open now, but it will definitely be open then. June is the start of peak tourist season -- they'll have their entrances open and most roads should be open too. I was there 3 weeks ago and the road that connects Old Faithful to the south entrance of the Park was closed, but I think I remember them saying it would be open by June 1st.  Oh man! You're gonna have a great trip! Fishing in the Park is my favorite."

flyfishing,377mr4,Jelly_Hammer,1 point,Tue May 26 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"The water is chilly, but that time of year, I think you'd be uncomfortable in neoprene. I'd recommend breathable waders if you want to use waders. My friends and I often go without waders. You can swim in just about every water source in the park at your own discretion. Waders are not necessary, but definitely useful, particularly on the Firehole. It's a wider river in some parts. The Gallatin is definitely fishable from the shore."
flyfishing,377irj,catchin_vibes,4,Mon May 25 14:53:46 2015 UTC,"Whats wrong with practicing? Get to a park and try different things until it works. I'd say casting a fly rod is a lot easier than hitting a golf ball. You need a little bit of help getting started, but you get so much feedback instantly its easy to fix problems. You just need to listen to what that feedback is telling you.   Line landing first - need more line speed and to not drop the rod tip on the forward cast. I see this a lot from people who tend to do excellent false casts then change it up the last minute on the final cast only to mess up what they already had just fine. Here its similar to golf. Swing through, don't hit.   The bunching is usually again not enough line speed and tailing loops. Make sure your plains are good and you don't creep on the back cast."
flyfishing,377irj,_iFish,1 point,Mon May 25 16:57:39 2015 UTC,Super helpful!  Thanks a million!
flyfishing,377irj,O_oblivious,3,Mon May 25 18:17:00 2015 UTC,"I would suggest a casting class with a CCI to work on your cast. A lot of local fly shops should offer these. This isn't just for beginners, but people of all skill levels can benefit from these classes when matched to their experience level.  From what I gather (could just be blowing smoke)- I would suggest stopping your forward cast sooner (higher tip) and then simply following the line down to the water (gravity) as the tippet unfurls, and maybe look into implementing a single haul cast?  Could also be rushing the forward cast, not letting the backcast unfurl and fully load the rod, causing you to lose power. Or trying to overpower the forward cast, which leads to rushing the cast, dropping the tip, and tailing loops. But I have no idea without actually seeing the cast. Everyone has camera phones now, so why not have your daughter video your cast, and then review it? Compare with online ""good"" casting videos, or maybe post for critique.  Good luck, and hope the timing clicks for you."
flyfishing,377irj,BenOlsensBeard,1 point,Mon May 25 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much.  It's not like it's frustrating, I'm still out fishing, so can't complain much about that.  I'm sure one of these times I'll do something that works and never look back!"
flyfishing,377irj,mattsfishingfortrout,3,Mon May 25 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"I think a casting class would do a lot of good, but before you do that you should have someone shoot a video (on a phone, for example) of you casting.  You might be surprised at how apparent problems in your mechanics are even without an expert diagnosis.  Clean the most obvious things up and then if you still want to improve (likely) go to a CCI to get some more fine-tuning done."

flyfishing,36zpp4,Flynnster14,5,Sat May 23 14:42:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely not a king, kings have black mouths.  I'm 99% sure it's a juvenile coho it's definitely a salmon, you can tell by the long anal fin.  Juvenile kings have the black mouth and would have more spots, pinks have spots on the tail and tend to go offshore immediately the scales are too small for it to be a sockeye or chum (are there even sockeye and chum in the Great Lakes?) plus they eat plankton.  Cohos are super aggressive and will feed in near shore areas, especially hatchery releases.  In fact there is a hatchery program in Washington where they release coho into ought sound well after they normally would, which makes the fish stick around and feed in the sound, these ""resident coho"" are very populate with beach fishermen."
flyfishing,36zpp4,akpowdermonkey,1 point,Sat May 23 17:33:13 2015 UTC,"First, juvenile trout are hard to identify and you generally use a couple of factors.     The anal fin is the best way to exclude types of trout.   You mistakenly think that this is what identifies it as a coho - quite the opposite.     In addition, coho often have a white outer edge of the anal fin (where only the back part is black; whereas chinook /king have a black out edge.     It is not a coho because    the anal fin is not like a sicle. The parr marks are fatter than the in-between part. outer edge is not white for the anal fin (it usually is in juveniles)   It is most likely a chinook /king because of the parr markings and anal fins.  I would lean toward the chinook/king.     EDIT: HERE IS A PHOTO OF A JUVENILE CHINOOK http://www.oceanlight.com/spotlight.php?img=13685"

The lakes I fish are at max 20ft deep so I didn't need to go crazy and I'm able to get down plenty deep.  The profile of the line is similar to that of the pike / muskie lines.  This line allows me to go after pike and bass where I fish.  Depending on what you need it could work.

flyfishing,36wwf8,Timeskillinus,2,Sat May 23 02:07:04 2015 UTC,I like the non slip mono loop all summer long when the bass are being aggressive and will chase. When they are very active they love the jig action. If they are less aggressive it's better to use a clinch knot it will keep the fly in their strike zone longer. I will typically get more strikes in the early season with the clinch knot. I have  only really tested this in still water so I don't k ow if it still applies to rivers. That's just my opinion. Also if you are newer to loop knots really get the knot down before you get out there. It's best to keep the knot shorter than your hook but also long enough so it still has action. That way the fly doesn't get caught up on the loop when you cast. That's my 2¢.
flyfishing,36wwf8,saladstudent,2,Sat May 23 05:44:09 2015 UTC,Also you sacrifice a little bit of knot strength with the fixed mono loop according to Rio.

I usually fish down by Sulak, because there's no pay-to-park, or near Bowman Bridge.  There's a parking lot, also free, just west of Bowman Bridge on 56th St. that will bring you down a dirt road about 1/2 mile or so.  You can park there and walk to the river.  There's rarely anyone there.  Where do you usually fish the PM from?"

The flies only section, up near Green Cottage, gets crowded on the weekends....esp. during a steelhead or salmon run....but it's productive water. Keep in mind that there's special regulations for parts of the river (catch-and-release, single flies, etc.).  The Pine River (near Luther, MI) is a nice river to fish too.  It's not too far from Baldwin (maybe 1/2 hour).  There's a campground there that you can park at and walk to the river.  I've had some luck with rainbows in the Pine."

flyfishing,36uf40,xxsoultonesxx,2,Fri May 22 15:51:54 2015 UTC,What kind of reel is that?
flyfishing,36vr5s,1StonedGoat,3,Fri May 22 14:38:54 2015 UTC,The general rule of thumb I use is: Your leader length (From indicator to weight) should be roughly 1.5 times the depth of water you are fishing. So if you are fishing 4 foot deep water run 6 foot. If you are fishing 2 foot water go with a 3 foot leader.  It just takes some trial and error to figure out what's working and where they fish are in the water column. Every day is different. I am constantly moving my indicator to changing my depth and figure out where the fish are.    Use weight to get your bugs down faster. I usually start with a B and either add or subtract weight depending on how fast I want to get my bugs down. Faster water needs more weight to get them down. Slower water and a longer drift you can use less weight since they have more time to sink.   I usually do about 12-18 inches from weight to my first fly. Depending on how close to the bottom I want it. Then 12-18 inches between other bugs.
flyfishing,36vr5s,M__C,1 point,Fri May 22 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely the correct answer.  There is almost no set it and forget it when it comes to adjusting your depth in a river since the depth in a river varies so much.  To nymph effectively, you will be adjusting your depth constantly throughout the day in accordance with where the fish are, and how deep the section of river you are fishing is."
flyfishing,36vr5s,daaaaaaave,2,Sun May 24 19:54:15 2015 UTC,"I dont see why you couldnt, in brazil we nymph with quite short leaders, it is much easier in tight spaces"
flyfishing,36vr5s,SuperiorChimpanze,2,Fri May 22 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"Nah, cut that leader down to about 3ft, tie your indicator on at that point, then go like 5x to the first fly (3 more ft down), then 6x to a bottom fly (16-24inches down), space between all the flies and indicator can be lengthened or shortened depending on depth of water. Weight added or removed depending on water speed."
flyfishing,36vr5s,P3zcore,2,Fri May 22 15:18:56 2015 UTC,"I suggest adding a few feet of tippet, that way you use less leader as you change, once you go to far up on the leader the thickness won't work for tying any more. Go with a 7 and a half foot leader and add some tippet to make it about 10 feet"
flyfishing,36vr5s,cabose4prez,1 point,Fri May 22 15:19:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions guys. Sounds like everyone has their own preferred techniques.
flyfishing,36vr5s,cabose4prez,1 point,Fri May 22 17:55:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I used to just not care but caring helps a lot. And them you just get comfortable how you do it and everyone else is stupid. So try a bunch of different ways until one clicks.
flyfishing,36vr5s,EuroNymphGuy,1 point,Fri May 22 23:46:01 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents.   If 15' of fast moving water is the depth, that is too deep for successful nymphing. The bobber will create a hinge and not pick up strikes. Ditto regarding really long leaders unless you tightline nymph.  A lot of drag will happen.   I'd consider moving to tightline nymphing and targeting shallow water. Most trout feed in waters 4' or shallower. Ideal current speed at surface is 1' per second. They can efficiently eye and pick off nymphs and dries. Landed a 21' holdover brown in about 2' of pocket water, for example.  So, if 15' refers to the width, tightline nymphing would also work. Would be ideal to fish all those pockets without a bobber.  Fish hunkered at bottom at 15' are in their resting lies. Not much food down there, too.  These Redditors are nymphing pros and look up their comments. /u/_ifish /u/dahuii22 /u/anacondatmz"
flyfishing,36vr5s,anacondatmz,1 point,Sat May 23 14:26:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words.  If he's using a 7'4"" rod, I'm pretty confident he's talking about 15' wide streams/small rivers."
flyfishing,36vr5s,anacondatmz,1 point,Sat May 23 20:17:50 2015 UTC,"I guess it really depends on what kind of action you're giving the flies. If you happen to be swinging them, a flourocarbon tapered leader with perhaps a foot or two of flouro tippet on the end should do just fine.  If you're tighline nymphing, I'd get with of the tapered leader altogether. With tightline nymphing you're trying to get the the flies down through the water column to that undercurrent as fast as possible. With a tapered leader, while it can be done... isn't ideal due to the taper. Different parts of the leader are going to sink at different rates. The flourocarbon tippet, because of it's uniform diameter is going to sink at a constant, even rate which will definitely increase your odds of hooking up. For someone getting started with this technique, I would go out and purchase a spool of 12-15lb Gold Stren, some tippet rings, and some 3-5lb flourocarbon tippet depending on the average size of fish in the area.   Then go with the following: Fly Line --> 12-15' of Gold Stren --> tippet ring --> 5-6' flouro tippet --> At this point you'll rig up 2 flies about 10-16"" apart.   Now you're going to have the gold stren run down the length of your rod, and in most you'll end up have it go around your spool a couple times. When you're fishing, you're going to want to have 1-2' of that gold stren out of your last guide at the tip of your rod, and you're going to focus on that as you're dead drifting your flies. The second you see that bright yellow line stop, or hesitate in an unatural fashion set that hook. You can take a little more gold stren out if you're trying to nymph a little further, but ideally you want to try and keep that fly under your rod tip as best as possible to help with the presentation of the nymph.  If you find yourself enjoying sticking to this method of fishing, I would suggest you look into picking yourself up a Rio Euro Nymph fly line. It'll make nymphing life even easier."

flyfishing,36sng1,sheepdogzero,2,Fri May 22 02:36:44 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. I was fishing in Northern Quebec last weekend for freshwater arctic char. The owner of the lodge we were visiting said that the only way to really distinguish between the char and the brookies was the black line on their pectoral fin separating the red / white. We didn't get any char, they were at the bottom of the 180' lake. We did manage get a handful of wild brookies on dry flies in over 100' of water which was pretty neat."

We updated our shocking sections to better include their preferred habitat and it definitely paid off!  Many of you know (Salmo) salar means leaper in latin.

Buddy (who hasn't fly fished before) and I drove 4 hours north of Montreal to a place called Pourvoirie Boismenu for a little brook trout, freshwater arctic char, and rainbow trout fishing. The goal of the trip was to catch some wild brook trout on some dry flies, something I don't get to do very often - if ever in my area. As well as get my buddy into some fish!  Trip turned out pretty good considering the weather (hot and sunny all day every day)... We ended up with about 35-40 brook trout over the 2.5 days of fishing. The majority of those were on the wild brook trout lakes (not the stocked lakes). Not too shabby considering he had never fly fished before and I had never fished for trout from a lake before.   Aside from landing a nice 15"" and 16"" brook trout, and watching my buddy land a bunch of fish. I'd have to say the coolest experience was to catch wild 12"" brookies on the surface with size 12 stimulators, where water depths were over 100' deep.   We got home a little early the Monday, so i grabbed my waders and headed off to my local river. Hooked into this beauty. All an all, great weekend!"

flyfishing,36ruhh,O_oblivious,1 point,Thu May 21 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"I think you're thinking of Skamania.  Salt Creek Public Fishing Area opens  New fishing access site ready for summer steelhead  The new Department of Natural Resources Salt Creek Public Fishing Area in Porter County is open and ready for the summer Skamania steelhead run.  The 75 acres of natural land northwest of Valparaiso provides anglers with nearly 6000 feet of access to a high-quality steelhead trout and salmon fishing stream and protects a section of Salt Creek's watershed.  Salt Creek PFA anglers, birdwatchers and nature enthusiast should park in the newly constructed parking lot off County Road 500 North on the north side of the property.  Salt Creek flows from south to north through upland and bottomland hardwood forest and fallow farm fields at Salt Creek PFA. The public property is similar to the DNR's nearby 76-acre Chustak Public Fishing Area along Salt Creek. Chustak PFA opened in 2001 and has a parking area off County Road 600 North.  Salt Creek PFA was bought in 2004 with funds provided from the sale of state fishing licenses. Salt Creek is a tributary to Lake Michigan, and generally offers excellent small-stream trout and salmon fishing as these fish swarm out of Lake Michigan on seasonal spawning runs.  During mid to late June, depending on water temperatures and water levels in the tributaries, summer-run adult Skamania steelhead trout return to Indiana tributaries where they were planted as fingerlings.  Most Skamania will ""stage"" near the mouths of Lake Michigan tributaries, with fish rushing upstream -- especially after a heavy rainfall -- to begin the run. By mid-August (depending on tributary temperatures and water levels), good numbers of Indiana Skamania have entered home tributary streams.  Skamania will continue to enter tributaries throughout the fall and winter months until March. Chinook and coho salmon return to Lake Michigan tributary streams to spawn from late August to early November. Winter-run steelhead should be in the stream from November to mid-April.  Salt Creek is small to medium-size stream flowing north through Porter County in northwest Indiana. Salt Creek joins the Little Calumet River near Portage, which flows into Lake Michigan near Burns Harbor."

I found that article last week, but was hoping for a little more fly-friendly info. Most of what I've found suggests spawn sacks or shrimp on tiny hooks and slip floats, and that's not quite my thing. I just don't know if I should fish for them like picky rainbows back in Missouri, or aggressive browns out for a meal, or something else entirely. Or even if I can use my 1/0 streamer hooks for them.  I fish rainbows and browns a lot, same for smallmouth, but I'm completely blind here."

If you can time it correctly getting into some summer run steelhead will be not problem on this tributary of Lake Michigan.  I usually float fish for them with a centerpin mostly because of the lack of casting room and structure of the river but if you don't mind roll casting a bunch and dead drifting a nymph then fly fishing wouldn't be a problem."

I might venture over to the Kankakee River to look for smallmouth this weekend, since I have an IL fishing license already.  What size hooks can you actually use for fish, though? I saw something about hook gap measurements, but no size equivalent. Also, St Joseph River is about 1:30 away from me, so Salt Creek or Trail Creek might be easier for me to get to when the time comes. Not opposed to driving, but I'm not sure how large St. Joseph is, or if I could handle it without my waders (left in MO)."
flyfishing,36ruhh,sciden,1 point,Fri May 22 00:37:52 2015 UTC,I am really new and don't know much about hook size but I ordered them offline and most of the hook sizes I have caught trout on are around 8-14. It is said that the skamania are much more aggressive so they might go for the bigger streamer flies. I am sorry that I cannot be more help because I am not as seasoned as you. The St Joe would be hard without waders but this river is one of the most stocked and when they run people take home the bag limit. My friend caught 20 6lbs+ a few weeks ago. I have no clue how fishing is on other rivers places hope you enjoy it though. I know that Indiana focuses a lot on stocking this river though.

flyfishing,36os4x,RoverLife,1 point,Thu May 21 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"that's been the best approach for me too - especially with any fly that has rubber legs that quiver in the water. Either it'll get hit hard the instant it hits the water or you need to just hold it still.    When the water is clear you can see them right up close eyeballing the fly, and it becomes a game of patience."

flyfishing,36n7o9,Benny_Liquid,2,Wed May 20 16:51:11 2015 UTC,"How long is it all put together? It looks fairly long if it is over 10' or so put together it may not be a ""fly"" Rod but an earlier adaptation where a long Rod was used to essentially drop a fly/bait where you wanted it and it wasn't really cast.    The bottom section appears to be wood, and the top to be made of bamboo.  It's so dark it's hard to tell what the top sections are made from.    I'm no expert but I've done some reading on fly fishing back in the old days like 1700s old days and it would make more sense that it a style of Rod like that.  But I couldn't tell you how old it is.  The modern style of fly rods we use that were made from Bamboo were brought about in the 1800s from the best of my memory."
flyfishing,36nxch,brook__trout,3,Wed May 20 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"The butterstick money rod is the 5wt. In the other weights the Echo glass casts nicer.  If you're going glass I'd suggest the Echo.  Look at both the Redington CT 8'6"" and the Echo Carbon 7' 3"" 3wt models as well. Both good rods.  Such a light rod the reel is not so important. Redington Drift will do you fine.  I like the Airflo Super Dry Elite in the DT for these rods.  You mention medium sized rivers. If you expect to be casting in some wind I'd look at the above rods in the 4wt models."
flyfishing,36nxch,FlyFishn,1 point,Wed May 20 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion. The reddington ct is on sale at cabelas right now for $89 and for that price you can't really go wrong so I figure I'll pick that up. What size of reddington drift reel should I be looking at to balance the 8'6"" 3wt?"
flyfishing,36nxch,FlyFishn,2,Wed May 20 22:22:13 2015 UTC,"I chose the 2/3 for my 8' 6"" CT but I have spare spools for my 2wt rods so that's why I went that way. It balances the rod great."
flyfishing,36nxch,FlyFishn,2,Wed May 20 22:54:45 2015 UTC,I chose the Super dry elite in the dbl taper because each taper on the line is different. The green end is a longer delicate taper and the orangeish end is a shorter stouter taper.  Two lines for the price of one ? Easy choice.  Line casts the CT3 great. I had the Rio trout lt on it and I didn't like it.
flyfishing,36nxch,FlyFishn,1 point,Wed May 20 23:02:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion! I'll probably end up with this exact set up.
flyfishing,36nxch,DankKabra,1 point,Wed May 20 23:10:49 2015 UTC,Nice. Its a good little set up that handles fish well with good feel. You'll enjoy it !
flyfishing,36nxch,FlyFishn,-1,Wed May 20 23:12:37 2015 UTC,What so you use a 3 weight for? I have a 4 wt and it took me like 5 mins to pull in a 15 inch rainbow last weekend it was brutal. I thought it would be a good challenge for trout in the river and i was correct. Is it for pan fish? I just find it odd that people need lighter rods then a 4 wt for any fish. I guess you can use lighter flies i just was curious what people use such rods as a 2 wt or even 3 wt for.
flyfishing,36nxch,DankKabra,2,Wed May 20 23:45:05 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of weekends ago I landed a 12 ish rainbow and a 14ish brown on the CT3. Both landed in just about a minute or just over. Light noodle rods protect tippet well.  I've caught many smaller smallmouth as well in around 10"" - 12"" and it performs just fine.  I recently caught shit here for suggesting an 11' 4wt Echo glass switch rod for bass/pike fishing. The switch equates to about a 6wt single hander. Perfect tool. Different strokes for different folks I guess.  We land Kings on 10' 5wts in AK. It tires those fish in that situation but they're eaten so no big deal.  Don't think that light rod means light fish. And a good noodle rod in a lighter weight protects those tippets giving you the ability to horse the fish more for a faster landing.  More feel and fight with the ability for a quicker release. Yes please."
flyfishing,36nxch,yellowbellyfrog,1 point,Wed May 20 23:59:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe the fish i caught was mad lol it was fine. I feel the same way i wanted more feel and more fight but if i keep having these drawn out fights im going to have to try a different rod. I dont want to return a fish to the water with any less of a chance of survival then before i caught it. The fish i caught also had two lines hanging out his mouth so maybe he knew what a net looked like. That was my problem i got him in like 4 times before i landed him he would get a foot from my scoop range and take off on a run. So that ct3 is that a noodle rod? What exactly is the difference? Obviously the length. My 4 wt is a regular graphite 8'6"" rls+ combo. I want to upgrade i was thinking about a 5 wt but i really like the feel of the 4 wt. My 5-6 weights always feel so bulky. Im sure they make all different types im just talking from my experience."
flyfishing,36nxch,yellowbellyfrog,1 point,Thu May 21 00:50:05 2015 UTC,I've landed a near 20 inch bow on my 3wt butterstick...
flyfishing,36nxch,DukeGordon,1 point,Thu May 21 18:05:13 2015 UTC,Just so you know I love my 3wt butter stick. I would just find a lightest reel you can find..one that is well under 4oz.

flyfishing,36k1fe,_iFish,1 point,Wed May 20 11:31:37 2015 UTC,"Who knows. Fishing has been really weird this season. Abnormal number of 16-20"" browns on the river.  EDIT: That came off sounding a little weird. Let me explain. The weather up here in Montreal area, the harsh winter, it's done some strange things to our river. Way more ice pack then I've ever seen on it this past winter. It led to lots of rocks being rearranged, some of the deeper holes were filled in... Really sucked to see it like that. We hardly received any big spring rains this season which kept the water super low. We're seeing huge amounts of algae on the rocks, stuff we didn't see at all last year. Fish weren't moving up the river the way they normally do, all just very weird. Buddies and I have spent a good 20-30 days out on the water so far, and while we normally catch a couple small guys and the odd 15+ inch brown trout... Thus far this season, we've landed a good 30-40 brown trout over 17"", maybe a dozen below that size. Furthermore, those fish we've been catching have been pretty chunky compared to the last couple springs, indicating to me that they haven't been too hard off. I dunno, just weird."

You can still dink around lakes and find fish on bigger water, but you can also do solo drifts, and hold in heavy current without someone panting on the oars. Sure it won't go as fast or cut waves, but you can fish everything pretty easily."

flyfishing,36ibhd,serpentjaguar,1 point,Wed May 20 04:26:41 2015 UTC,"Once, well over 20 years ago this was --I lived in Jackson at the time-- a friend and I did a six day trip from Green River Lakes to the Cirque of the Towers and back, in late November/early December, ostensibly with the idea of doing some rarely-climbed early-season ice-walls, as well as generally digging on the Wind River Range which, by any sane criteria, is one of the remotest and bad-assest ranges in the lower 48 by a large margin.    The whole thing was largely a disaster.  It ended up getting down to 40 below at night and we froze our young asses off.  Come daylight we could move during the morning hours when everything was still frozen, but by mid-day we'd be dead in the water since it didn't occur to us that we'd need snowshoes before we could even get to where our climbing gear could help us, we having erroneously assumed that so early in the season deep snow would not be a huge issue.    In any case, we never did make it to the Cirque, and instead doubled back around and spent the last two days in a wretched state, waiting for friends from Jackson to come pick us up.  It was a glorious debacle and I learned a great deal while suffering, through ignorance, far more than was necessary.    I was 19, my friend was 22, if that lends any perspective to the affair."

Orvis puts them on the Helios 2 (regular stripping guide), and G Loomis (Shimano, boo) puts them on the NRX.   I figured this weave out about a year ago, and I saved the left list from it. It's a pretty easy one to start with. I do not have the patience to do multilayer weaves. They are super tedious to make a left list, and they take many hours to complete.  I got halfway through a Grateful Dead steal your face weave when I realized it's not worth it. Most people think it's a sticker anyway!"

flyfishing,36l20i,daaaaaaave,2,Wed May 20 14:33:09 2015 UTC,"You can use it however you like, but there are definitely better tools for what you are doing.  Your rod would be better suited as a dedicated dry fly rod in my opinion.   It should have no trouble turning over small nymph rigs.  Larger flies/indicator/weight will be an issue though.   With a 7'6"", you will feel pretty limited if you are a tight line (Czech, Polish, whatever) nymph fisherman.  Fishing from a tube, boat or anything else that leaves you closer to the water is easier with a longer rod. I usually recommend a 9'6"" or 10'.   Shorter rod = accuracy  Longer rod = distance"

flyfishing,36j8im,zoum26,14,Tue May 19 20:05:04 2015 UTC,Your line will have more memory with that little backing. Fill it until the backing hits the bottom of the screw that holds the handle onto the spool.
flyfishing,36j8im,rafthikefish,2,Tue May 19 21:11:37 2015 UTC,"This should be upvoted further. Your line will develop memory and form into smaller coils which can be annoying when trying to manage line on water. Also, your retrieve rate (how much line your reel retrieves per revolution) will be lower with the line spooled the way it is now. That's not necessarily a big deal for small fish, but your hand/arm will tire more quickly. I say it's worth it to re-spool."

flyfishing,36j8im,DukeGordon,3,Tue May 19 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"Hint for the next reel you fill. Start backwards by winding the fly line on first, and then continue to add the backing until the reel is almost full. Cut your backing there and unwind, and then start the backing on to the reel where you cut it. No more guessing as to how much backing to add in order to fill your entire spool."

flyfishing,36j8im,daaaaaaave,1 point,Tue May 19 20:15:13 2015 UTC,"I like more backing on my reels because picking up line is faster and the memory is less of an issue.   Another reason is if I'm drift fishing and I get hung up there is less chance of spooling the reel if I can't turn around immediately. Has saved me on more than one occasion. You will never need 100 yards of backing on a 5 wt reel to fight a fish, but possibly Mother Nature."

Copper and brown polarized lenses give the most contrast, Amber is in the game too and it's better for cloudy days. A specific low light lens like zeal's dawn patrol and Smith's low light igniter are amazing at bringing out contrast in near zero light.  Avoid gray lenses, they are for driving."
flyfishing,36jqsi,rafthikefish,1 point,Tue May 19 23:38:44 2015 UTC,"Bam, hit the nail on the head. Also you already own some of the best polarized glasses made in probably the world. Smith makes some absolutely stellar products, especially the chromapop lenses. They're very fishing oriented."

As long as it's polarized, by a good maker and is Amber/Copper/Brown you're going to get a lot of contrast for in the water.  The fit of the sunglasses, on the other hand, can make a pretty big difference in how effective they are.  You don't want a lot of light creeping in from between the lens and your cheek, for example or from the outside of the glass. Bright days will make this apparent in a way that won't be indoors or with clouds around."

I would read some reviews online and see what line weights people are using for that rod.   I would go with a Weight Forward Floating line to start. You might want a sink tip later on if you need to get deep for Bass, but that probably isn't necessary. There's a million different fly lines - some people have strong preferences, but I would probably just go for whatever's most affordable when you're starting out. Any online fly shop should have a variety of lines.  I would get a 7.5 ft 3X tapered leader and some 3X tippet for warmwater. Tie the tippet on to the end of the leader so it doesn't get too short as you change flies. You might want some smaller tippet if you think you'll use some small flies or if you ever try for trout. Again, any online fly shop should have plenty of leaders.  Bass and panfish aren't too picky about flies, so you have a lot of options. Definitely get some Wooly Buggers - they come in a variety of sizes, colors, weights, etc., but they'll all catch fish. I would also get some terrestrial dry fly patterns - look for things meant to imitate ants, grasshoppers, or beetles. Size 12 is a good size for Panfish. Almost any size can work, but I try to avoid going too small because they sometimes inhale flies and they can be hard to get out.   Orvis has a good selection of flies and their site is well organized. You could buy them anywhere, but I think their site lets you get an idea of the variety of patterns available."

If you want big rainbows try out Bynum or eureka.  Honestly head south to the sun river if you are able. There are plenty of access points with lots of big Browns to be had. In those riffles right there at Simms bridge I saw a ten pound brown pulled out on a double bunny.   Upstream on the sun you can fish below the diversion dam for rainbows and brookies or upstream and fish the creeks and diversion lake for the same with an occasional cutthroat or grayling."
flyfishing,36hji2,IflyMT,1 point,Tue May 19 17:31:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I was looking around on Google Earth and the river over there looked pretty sparse. I will definitely check out Eureka and/Bynum.

flyfishing,36fjkj,EuroNymphGuy,9,Tue May 19 00:10:11 2015 UTC,"A lot of the time people ask questions in this subreddit that have really simple answers that help the person out quite a bit. This isn't really one of those questions.   Setting the hook with tiny flies on the swing is about as hard a thing to do in fly fishing as you'll find. You have to accept that your hook-up rates are probably going to be down from average. It sounds like you're already thinking about the set, so you're doing pretty much everything right at this point. Setting downstream doesn't really work that great when swinging flies (especially tiny ones!). Setting any directions can be difficult. With the fly on a tight line presentation, fish have a harder time inhaling the fly, or, like you found, your strike pulls it out of their mouth.   A lot of the time, I'll simply let the fish come tight and then pull opposite of which direction I think they took the fly. For example, if I'm swinging across the current and I think the flish are lying to the left of the current, I assume they're going to dive down and away from the current once they've taken the fly, so I'll try and tighten to the fish by pulling line and sweeping the rod tip towards the current. Again, more just pulling tight and not setting in a jerking motion.   Another option is the salmon/steelhead method of keeping a small ""shock loop"" of line pinched between the reel and your fingers. A couple of inches is sufficient. When you feel a strike, release the loop and allow it to come tight and then swing your rod opposite of which way you think the fish dove (or just towards your downstream, if you have no idea). It definitely takes some practice, but the theory is that small shock loop always the fish to turn with the fly and you set the hook when it's slipped towards the side of his mouth.   Hope some of that helps!"
flyfishing,36fjkj,down_view,2,Tue May 19 01:39:24 2015 UTC,"In addition to dropping a loop, you can also just hold the cork (no fingers on the line) and set the a light drag on your reel. Once you hear the clicker on the reel start going, set with the rod."

flyfishing,36fjkj,qGqGq,1 point,Tue May 19 09:33:58 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why is it so hard to set the hook with a small wet? I often swing small streamers and find that the fish usually hook themselves. What is it about small flies that keeps this from happening?"
flyfishing,36fjkj,qGqGq,2,Tue May 19 14:06:37 2015 UTC,This a good summary here.
flyfishing,36fjkj,down_view,1 point,Tue May 19 15:28:58 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. I didn't think about the way the fish takes the fly -it makes sense that a tight line wouldn't work well if the fish is using suction from its gill covers to take the fly. I'm guessing they don't do that with baitfish, so they strike my streamers much harder."
flyfishing,36gc5j,Methelsandriel,2,Tue May 19 04:15:51 2015 UTC,"If you wade in the river, look downstream. There will be fish stacked up picking off nymphs that you kick up. They will be almost impossible to catch.  I was there in July last year and had a lot of success when the fish were eating dries, but a lot of trouble with nymphing. For the dries it was all about light tippet and small flies that matched the hatch. The rise forms were often just tiny dimples, but I caught some pretty decent fish.  Most of my trouble with nymphing was that I found a pool where I could see the fish (and they could see me), and I kept trying to fish to them. I should have moved on to a spot where I could be a little more secretive. It's well worth it to stop into a local fly shop and have them help you set up the right nymph rigs. Getting the right distance between indicator, weight, and flies makes a huge difference."
flyfishing,36gc5j,WillyF,2,Tue May 19 04:46:45 2015 UTC,"Like the previous commenter pointed out, the fish will be stacked up in spots where you can see them and they can see you. The key definitely is finding the right depth with your nymphs/indicator. Depending on the day, you may practically have to floss the fish with your nymph to get a take. That said, there are a lot of nice fish in that section."

flyfishing,36ext9,the8igern,4,Mon May 18 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"Sure thing.  I've made a rant/post before on this topic - http://www.reddit.com/r/flyfishing/comments/1wdgb0/after_reading_this_subreddit_for_a_while_i_have/.    I think it's already been established on here how I feel about TFO in general.  In short, TFO is riding on a reputation built about a decade or more ago when they really were the best game in town as far as low cost rods.  Thing is, they never got any better.  So may other companies have not only surpassed them, but in my opinion, make them look laughable in comparison.  The BVK's number one issue is that it breaks.  A LOT.  I guide and see these pieces of crap come through my boat all the time.  I've never in my life seen a rod so willing to break.  Sure the warranty is great.  But I'd rather have a rod where I don't need to warranty it very time I want to use it.  TFO has even admitted this fault to me, but they still haven't fixed it.  Basically, at their price points, I think TFO is my last choice for every rod they make.  The BVK casts just fine, but I don't consider it a quality product.  Look at offerings from Echo, Redington, Allen, and really anyone else in those price points.  I can't stress enough how much better their products are."

flyfishing,36ext9,Dowhatnow30,2,Mon May 18 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"The BVK breaks when you handle it incorrectly. Never ever grab a fly rod above the cork handle. Even the best will break that way. The BVK is great bc it's light and stiff. As long as you understand that you'll be fine. If you bang it around and bounce heavy flies off the shaft it will break. If you treat it like a fly rod should be treated it'll last you forever.   You won't find a better light, fast rod for the money. If you're willing to pay 2-3 times what the BVK costs then you can buy a fast, light rod that you can abuse. I personally love my BVKs but I treat them right."
flyfishing,36ext9,impactfandan,1 point,Tue May 19 00:24:45 2015 UTC,"TFO is good bang for the buck.  For the big bass and pike flies, however, the line choice (taper and weight) is more important than the rod choice.  You want a short heavy belly to turn those big flies over.  I've been using a WF9F Rio Pike line for 5+ years now."
flyfishing,36ext9,fishbummin27514,1 point,Mon May 18 21:34:02 2015 UTC,"So my buddy has a BVK and he loves it, except for it has broken twice now. Best warranty in the game however who wants to send their rod back every season? I used to work in a fly shop back in 2011 when the Redington Predator first came out. This was right after Redington was bought by Sage or Sage was bought by Redington, whichever it was. I am kind of a Sage fanboy but for my money if you blind folded me and handed me a predator I would tell you it was a sage. I think they actually share blank materials now. Do youself a favor and go test drive one. For a rod in the 200 to 300 range you will not do better."
flyfishing,36ext9,reconditelost,1 point,Tue May 19 13:13:51 2015 UTC,"While I have a BVK and love it, I think they are a poor choice for a 7wt.    For Pike and Bass you are going to be using big flies and lifting some good sized fish.   The BVK is light and fast but lacks in lifting power (pulling bass out of weeds etc)  and is too delicate (breakable) -  sooner or later you'll zing the tip with a big heavy fly.  I'd suggest test driving Echo, Redington and Allen."

Other than that, I haven't seen much of a difference, they both are great cameras. I really don't know if the screen on the back of the 4 is worth it, I don't use the screen often enough to validate the extra battery drain so really it will just be up to your budget. Grab a few extra batteries and have fun!

I know a farmer that is trying to make one of his lakes a good fishing lake, in the last 5 years he has killed over 30.000 arctic char from that lake but it still doesn't make a difference and the lake is still crowded with small char(I'm not joking, 30.000).  C&R  is  not  always  needed  When I'm river fishing I release most of the fish I catch, but when I'm lake fishing there is absolutely no need to C&R at all.

flyfishing,3664a9,ianbouchard,7,Sat May 16 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"You can do a couple things. You can do a cross body cast, where you turn mostly facing up stream and bring your back cast up and over your non-dominate shoulder.  You can cast forwards downstream, look over your shoulder and lay your backcast down on the water (typically called a backhand cast). Or you can learn to cast with your opposite hand, which is actually pretty simple once you understand the mechanics of fly casting."
flyfishing,3664a9,down_view,3,Sat May 16 15:20:35 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks for the tips. I should have asked earlier - all I did this morning was make quartering downstream casts and swing wooly buggers

flyfishing,3664a9,el__duderino,3,Sun May 17 15:36:30 2015 UTC,"One of the most useful skills I've learned so far is the ability to be ambidextrous.  It might not look pretty but I can cast at almost any angle with either hand now and get the job done, it only comes with practice."
flyfishing,3664a9,enzomatic75,2,Sat May 16 15:10:10 2015 UTC,If you don't like using your alternate hand you can cast over your opposite shoulder with your dominant hand facing normally.  Also you can turnaround on the river and cast backwards in that you let your fly fall on your backside and you face the back-cast.  Takes some practice to get the hang of it on both alternates.
flyfishing,3664a9,HideousNomo,1 point,Sat May 16 15:15:40 2015 UTC,I cross my body mainly because I am not coordinated enough to manage line with the rod hand and manage rod with the line hand. There's no rules so long as the fly lands good and the drift is dead.
flyfishing,3664a9,pattyfatsax,1 point,Sat May 16 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"I will usually cast in the direction down river of my dominate hand and then lay the fly on the backcast. I will also ""sidearm cast, it works well for nymphs and streamers but wont work for delicatly laying dries down."
flyfishing,364b2i,alextron,4,Sat May 16 00:27:22 2015 UTC,Moen does an incredible job of capturing what Steelhead angling in the PNW is all about. This is the third in the series of movies he has made about steelheading (preceded by fall and winter run) and in my opinion it is his best

flyfishing,364b2i,POZZD,2,Sat May 16 02:50:49 2015 UTC,That was great! Was a lot of that stuff just for the film though? Like the casting style?
flyfishing,364b2i,beer_engineer,3,Sat May 16 14:27:30 2015 UTC,Not at all.  Two handed spey casting is how things are done in this part of the world.  It's really the only way to throw big heavy flies and heavy sink tips with no back cast room.
flyfishing,364b2i,xxsoultonesxx,1 point,Sat May 16 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"So those guys were using switch rods, right? Using spey technique? Forgive me as I'm new to those rods. I've got a 9-10wt Cortland single hander that I'd like to catch steel with, but I've heard it's not the ideal weapon for that type of fishing."
flyfishing,364b2i,beer_engineer,1 point,Sun May 17 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"Switch rods and spey rods are pretty much the same thing.  Some refer to shorter spey rods as ""switch"" rods, but there's no point in calling them a ""switch"" rod because nobody uses them for anything but spey casting.  From the video, I can't really tell what the length of rods are.  But either way, they're definitely two handers."

flyfishing,364jko,alfiegee,1 point,Sat May 16 13:52:56 2015 UTC,Personally I wouldn't go fast action. You're not throwing pike flies. The feel on a slower rod is awesome and you will be a better caster for it.   I'm only saying this because It's what I do. I love fiberglass...   Try and get a Scott G series.
flyfishing,364jko,S0urDiesel,1 point,Sat May 16 12:07:09 2015 UTC,"In general look for something between a stiff #6 and #8. In your case maybe more of a 6 or 7. The heft you are looking for in a streamer rig isn't necessarily for throwing the big flies or landing huge fish, though it helps, its for your streamer line. The line weight is overlooked by many people just getting into streamer fishing. You will want two lines, one heavily forward weighted floater and a full sink (or long 25-30' sinking head) or at the least a sinking versileader on the end of a weight forward floater. I fish Airflow Galloup series and they are a dream.   Rod brand is less important, just make sure you get the right rod offering by whoever you choose- that being a fast action. For around 200 look at the TFO BVK, Echo, Reddington, St Croix, and Cabelas have some good options. Its a meat chucker not a dry fly stick, no need to get too fancy just get the right line."
