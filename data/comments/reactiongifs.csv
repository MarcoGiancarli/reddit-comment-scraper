Ok, that's a bit mean, but seriously; it is MUCH better to be working in a place where if you need to take off early one day, you can totally do that and everyone is fine with you doing that. But that can't happen if co workers are resentful. Part of having that perk is supporting other people having it.  When you see someone leave work early, even though we're all working on the same thing, you think ""good for you!"" - the more people that do it and the more people that are happy to see it happen, the more acceptable it becomes, and the more you benefit from it being there when you need it.

But then if you deep dream after you CAS a picture you will have the circles/dog eyes that aren't CASed.   The solution, and I don't know how it would be done, the best result would be if it was possible to take the meta data from how the original picture was content aware scaled and then apply those distortions to a version of the original image that has been deepdreamed."

reactiongifs,3e0eoi,shadowenx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not really sure what that means, but I'll do my best to describe what it was like for me during my best experience. I felt like I was launched at full speed into the stratosphere, but at the same time traveling deeply inward. The ""travel"" was nearly instantaneous but my ""destination"" was like an endless room of impossible geometric shapes with a faceless goddess in the center. I definitely felt a female presence which is why I use that term. She indicated to me that I was witnessing that dimension way ahead of time but to enjoy it while I was there as not many people get to travel there and return to talk about it. I was then presented with a flash of my entire existence since birth, feeling like the universe was scrutinizing every decision I'd ever made in my life up to that point. I also heard the music that I was destined to create. As a musician it was mind boggling, as if I was being shown my true worth as an artist. And then I slowly faded back into reality. The next several minutes, surrounded by friends that had also just experienced similar things or were in the middle of it, were serene, peaceful. The visuals at this point more closely resembled OP's gif, but not very much. The room was changing colors rapidly and I could see the fibers in the carpet growing and shrinking. The girl I was with looked like shooting stars were firing out of her eyes. And then it was over. The whole thing was maybe 15 minutes long.   Since the stuff was around I figured I'd do it as often as possible as I didn't know when I'd ever have the chance again. I'm glad I took advantage of that year because I haven't come across it since. Never paid for it either, and I can safely say that it did no harm to my mental state. In fact I'd say that it made me a more patient and motivated person. Similar to my experiences with LSD, but in ways easier to digest.  Pretty sure it was DMT haha"

The 'explain that away with a line of dialogue' explanation for why they can't simply buy back Django's wife is forced, especially in light of the extremely complex and dangerous plot they end up adopting instead.   ""Damn it, Jon stole my bike and now he's selling it on Craigslist.""  ""Should we buy it?""  ""Hell no! If he finds out it was my bike in the first place, he might not sell it to me. I know. Let's concoct an elaborate scheme to pretend like we're car thieves so that, maybe, we can get the bike back as part of the deal.""  ""Great plan. I guess we'd better go steal some cars.""

reactiongifs,3dyhhg,uscmissinglink,81,Mon Jul 20 19:38:01 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that:    A. They wouldn't get an audience in order to only buy a lowly slave.    B. If Leo's character knew how much Django wanted her he would run the price up exponentially.
reactiongifs,3dyhhg,MichaelDelta,37,Mon Jul 20 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"You're correct. ALSO we can't rule out that 1) Schultz abhors slavery, and will be tempted toward any plan that involves him not participating in it (I.E. buying her). 2) Schultz despises slavers like Candie, and will be partial to any plan that involves fucking one over 3) Schultz is a VERY high risk man. This one is more implied, but being a bounty hunter in those days was not a long lived profession. 4) Schultz has worked with men like Candie before. He has good reason to suspect that Candie would never sell Broomhilda to Django/himself. 5) his very reverence for the German fairytale itself could also have played a part in this decision. It could very well seem that the dramatic, epic action was the only appropriate one for Broomhilda and her 'Siegfried.'"

reactiongifs,3dyhhg,SkateboardG,2,Mon Jul 20 20:44:11 2015 UTC,"Granted, it's been awhile since I saw the movie, but wasn't their plan, then, essentially to make Leo an offer so big he couldn't refuse on a slave he really didn't want to sell? In theory, this was to get his attention to gain an audience, and if that's the case, they went about doing it in the most complex manner possible.  Since they clearly have the money and the willingness to play at deception, points A and B could have been resolved without needing to resort to the elaborate scheme.  Of course, I'm not stupid; I know that complexity drove the plot and I'm willing to suspend disbelief. But the original question was about plot holes, so that's what I'm talking about."
reactiongifs,3dyhhg,uscmissinglink,13,Mon Jul 20 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"I don't believe they ever intended to actually buy a Mandingo (idk if that's the term). The point was by offering a massive sum of money for a fighter that Candie didn't want to sell they could play the old ""we will be back in a few days after you have had time to consider our offer"". Then they could say ""O and also could you sell us this slave because I like speaking German with her"". Candie would be so wrapped up in the pros and cons of the Mandingo offer that he would let Broomhilda go without second thought.  Edit: and then never return to buy the Mandingo."
reactiongifs,3dyhhg,MichaelDelta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly right.   People tearing the premise down have missed some component of this and need to rewatch it to fully understand what is going on, I guess."

When you hear the Italian one maybe all you think about is Italian food or something like that. Because you're not as used to the sound, it's easier to apply a different meaning/context to the Italian word.

It's not about pretending that it's your dad that's fucking you, or that you're fucking your daughter, or any of that shit. A lot of it comes down to domination and that a girl was controlled by her father, so she wants to be controlled by whoever is fucking her.   Sometimes it's creepy and they're using it for some type of weird daddy issues, other times it's just the woman wanting a bit of dad dick. The world is a large and mysterious place."

reactiongifs,3dxxzv,hiyosilver64,3,Mon Jul 20 19:03:24 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of driving drunk or tired, which are terrible terrible ideas... Driving (a little) baked, if you're driving for a living, is a pretty good idea for the boredom involved. Doesn't slow down your reactions (I swear), only slows that pesky higher thought which a delivery driver doesn't need. Doesn't make you less wary, makes you more so... of course when driving you should always keep your head on a swivel.  I wouldn't recommend getting high for most jobs--definitely not customer service, a high person will fuck that up. But IMO it's not accurate to think that driving high is driving impaired like with alcohol/sedatives. I may catch flak for actually saying this, but I believe it: The only added danger to driving high rather than driving straight is that if you are in an accident and the police find out you were high, you'll be liable for it even if you did 100% nothing wrong, and will probably go straight to jail.  But from a performance point of view I have never felt nor seen in others an impairment to their driving from smoking before work. Once you've been driving your routes for a while, and maybe you should do that straight at first until you're used to them, it becomes mostly reflexes. Delivery drivers smoke, and delivery drivers are safer drivers than Ethel who never goes above the speed limit and panics at every intersection.  Edit: The above applies to habitual smokers... an inexperienced smoker will be distracted by the same sensations that a habitual smoker finds comforting."
reactiongifs,3dxxzv,TKfromCLE,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:49 2015 UTC,"http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/does-marijuana-use-affect-driving  ""Although marijuana had a less dramatic effect than alcohol on drivers the study found it still impairs "" one measure of driving performance."" The drug reduced the drivers' peripheral vision giving them tunnel vision. People driving with blood concentrations of 13.1 µg/L THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, showed increased weaving within the lane, similar to those with 0.08 breath alcohol, the threshold for impaired driving in many states.  Drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana enhanced the effect, so that drivers using both substances weaved within lanes even if their blood THC and alcohol concentrations were below the impairment thresholds for each substance alone. Alcohol, but not marijuana, increased the number of times the car actually left the lane and the speed of weaving. ""  http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/24/politics/marijuana-study-drivers-impact/  ""A second survey, the largest of its kind ever conducted, assessed whether marijuana use by drivers is associated with greater risk of crashes. The survey found that marijuana users are more likely to be involved in accidents, but that the increased risk may be due in part because marijuana users are more likely to be in groups at higher risk of crashes. In particular, marijuana users are more likely to be young men – a group already at high risk.  This was the most precisely controlled study of its kind yet conducted, but it measured the risk associated with marijuana at the levels found among drivers in a large community. Other studies using driving simulators and test tracks have found that marijuana at sufficient dosage levels will affect driver risk.  “Drivers should never get behind the wheel impaired, and we know that marijuana impairs judgment, reaction times and awareness,” said Jeff Michael, NHTSA’s associate administrator for research and program development. “These findings highlight the importance of research to better understand how marijuana use affects drivers so states and communities can craft the best safety policies.”  http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/2015/nhtsa-releases-2-impaired-driving-studies-02-2015"

I wouldn't mind if our yards looked the same, but ours looks way more lush than hers. We can't cut it as low as she can because our grass grows way faster and way thicker, so hers is always shorter, even if we mow on the same day.  She has a fence in the back yard so she mows our side of it so we don't have to run the weed wacker on her fence (which is very nice), but then as soon as the fence ends it's like she gets lost without having that as a guide and starts coming toward our driveway until she's 2-3 mower-widths into our yard. Looking at our houses/yards from the street it's clear that she veers when she's mowing."

As long as your bill has not been posted and you are still in the same billing period they should be able to do it no problem. If they have a plan that covers Scandinavia you should be able to reduce the cost of your overage by a large margin.

reactiongifs,3dvv1w,MR_RC,-14,Mon Jul 20 13:06:27 2015 UTC,Yuck. Yall motherfuckers need girlfriends.
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,cmrncstn,7,Mon Jul 20 00:13:01 2015 UTC,I'd probably never buy a flashlight but why is it okay for women to have sex toys but gross for men to have one of equal function?
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,cosine83,10,Mon Jul 20 05:23:11 2015 UTC,"Because double standards! But seriously though, buy whatever sex toys you want, more guys should explore their own bodies."
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,Lynx436,3,Mon Jul 20 06:15:30 2015 UTC,I agree. I just have no conceivable use for one. My hand works fine and flashlights seem like more effort to use.
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,cosine83,4,Mon Jul 20 06:39:04 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing, until I bought one. It really is a whole 'nother level than doing it by hand, it's pretty incredible. But yeah, you do have to wash it out before and after so it isn't really suitable for everyday use. I pull mine out once every other week or so when I really wanna have a night of fun.  Honestly, I'd recommend you try it. They aren't that expensive and they really do feel good."
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,_Dester_,-3,Mon Jul 20 07:06:08 2015 UTC,"I wasn't inferring that it's ok, not ok, for men, for women, etc... Masturbation is normal and I can't lie and say I don't rub one out before bed often. My comment was more intended as an observation about how gross secondhand sex toys are and that the persons mentioned in the post could probably do well with some actual human sexual interactions, to which I will honestly say that I have no clue about their business, relationships or sexual status/orientation so ultimately it's not about gender for me it's about fucking a piece of plastic after knowing somebody before actually sold it to acquire some quick cash for God knows what. Hence my previous ""yuck"". This IS reddit as well so who knows this isn't a simple attempt to gain karma and stir up some trouble in the comments section while sitting back and laughing evilly while we all yell and disagree and downvote the shit out of each other. I hope you're satisfied with my point of view and will give me one imaginary Internet point if not know I will have a complete meltdown and troll every post, past present and future of yours because I'm a sad neckbeard who lives in my parents basement. Have a lovely day."
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,cmrncstn,5,Mon Jul 20 08:53:27 2015 UTC,"well with some actual human sexual interactions   One can possess a sex toy and have actual human sexual interactions, you know.   But besides, maybe the dude just doesn't want to deal with the complexities that are inherent with dealing with another human being, but still wants an approximation of the physical sensations. Nothing wrong with it when you look at it that way. Also, Fleshlights are made of a silicone type material, not plastic."
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,SgtMustang,0,Mon Jul 20 06:37:04 2015 UTC,I hear you Sargent. I am all for people doing what they please but my opinion that it's gross to use a secondhand sex toy is going to stand and not waver due to other people's opinions on the matter. Think what you like and I'll do the same. With all due respect of course.
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,cmrncstn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:59:37 2015 UTC,Well here's an interesting semi-rhetorical question for you to consider:  Would you experience such revulsion at the notion that a sexual partner of yours had sex with one or more person(s) in the past?
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,SgtMustang,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:32:53 2015 UTC,"There's quite a big difference between a person and a sex toy. For one, the human vagina is pretty much self-cleaning."
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,TheDivineSappho,0,Mon Jul 20 07:52:07 2015 UTC,"Actually I thought of this first and understand your point in asking. This is a complex conversation I originally was not interested in having in correlation to my simple original response to the original post. Yes a dirty preused piece of silicone (see I noted your earlier correction) and a woman are similar in the fact I don't know or have any control over who's dick has been there before. However the choice between a new unused sex toy and a used one is simple to me. If you feel I didn't intelligently understand all of this chat before I made my original comment then you have wasted your time in trying to bring some wisdom or light to me. I get it, all of it. How hard was it to get the joke I made to start about the grossness of a pawn shop bought sex toy and the reference to a well known meme? That's what I think needs to be understood here is that it's MY opinion and you don't have to agree but you also can't assume that I misunderstand the entire topic because you may not agree with my points."
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,cmrncstn,0,Mon Jul 20 09:50:18 2015 UTC,"How hard was it to get the joke I made to start   It's less about ""getting it"" and more about the condescension in ""Yall need girlfriends"". You just come across like a dick."
reactiongifs,3dvv1w,SgtMustang,0,Mon Jul 20 08:16:12 2015 UTC,"I am a dick. But I'm not stupid. And this is reddit. Derision, condescension, and differing opinions are some of the best things about this community imo. That's just me though. I hope you aren't frustrated or anything about the conversation because I'd really be torn up inside if you feel like your point wasn't understood or cared about. I see your points and I hope you were courteous enough to try and see my points. Ultimately it's just Internet time wasting bs that shouldn't be taken too seriously anyway. It was fun though buddy and now we can be friends."

The first bite was actually kindof odd and unpleasant. I've never had meat with such a tough consistency (steak and pork and etc. are squishy, and chicken and duck just fall apart in your mouth). Once I starting chewing it, the flavor exploded. It was like I was listening to James Blake's Retrograde ""SUDDENLY I'M HIT!"" There were so many flavors going in and out of intensity and I was a little bit awestruck at the party in my mouth. After I beat off from the experience, I ate every other bit. I also ate eggs with runny yolks mixed with the bacon...mind-blowing"

At what threshold do you admit that he might just be a cancer and not a part of the human biological system?  I mean, why do you think cancer becomes so malignant? It's because the body's defense mechanism can't tell whether the cancer cells are of any use to the body, despite taking up space, food and energy and not providing any functional ability.  I mean, sure, it sounds like we should be against murder, but if you view humanity as a single organism, you're really just saying 'oh, we should give this cancer a chance'"

He really screwed up there, because what he was trying to say, was said in a manner that was very easily taken in the wrong way. However, someone who had no reason to be upset, heard what he was actually trying to convey, and that was that the Mexican government is so corrupt/poor that they're incapable, unable, and often unwilling to deal with the killers, rapists, and etc. So they ultimately get sent to America illegally (indirectly), where they commit more crimes, get deported, and the cycle then repeats. He never said all illegal immigrants were bad, he just spoke of the really bad killers/rapists/etc that must be stopped, but people took it poorly, because if his tone and poor choice of words. Basically it was more wrong how he said it, then what he said."

I've always found that when I talk to cute girls, I always think they're into me, but when I'm having a decent conversation with a girl who I'm not attracted to, I would never guess in a million years she's into me.

reactiongifs,3drnob,zewm426,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:01:48 2015 UTC,I get uneasy about any extension that purports to hold all my password and allow for only 1 master password.  Couple this with autofill and I feel I am a few keystrokes away from getting my whole system compromised. Are these concerns valid?
reactiongifs,3drnob,zewm426,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:10:23 2015 UTC,"No they are not.  It's not only an extension that saves it locally. They are stored remotely with encryption. You have a password vault that you can access.  It automatically generates passwords with random letters, numbers and symbols. Up to 24 characters.  I've been using it for over a year now with no problems. I have my email accounts, bank accounts, gaming accounts, forums, etc. They all have secure randomly generated passwords and each website, account, and game have a unique password. So even if someone gets a hold of one of my passwords from let's say reddit, it's not the same password for anything else.  I used to use just one password for everything because it was easier to remember. Then someone hacked my netflix account and I had to call to get it back. The fucker even renamed my proile to his stupid name. This pissed me off to no end and that's when I found out about lastpass. My buddy gave me a free trial of the premium membership and I haven't looked back since.  It is a pain in the ass when you first set it up though because you have to go to each site you want generated passwords on. After you have the bulk of your sites saved it's pretty smooth sailing.  Lastly, Laspass isn't the only service of this type. I'm sure you can google around for similar companies. LP just happened to be the service my friend was using and he vouched for it. I've known him for 10 years and he's a computer security advocate. I trust his judgement."
reactiongifs,3drnob,zewm426,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:06:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for this explanation but what if I switch computers or use a public computer? I would still need remember all my passwords right?
reactiongifs,3drnob,zewm426,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:13:30 2015 UTC,You can download the extension to multiple computers and browsers. I have it on Chrome on my desktop and on Firefox on my laptop. The only thing you need is an internet connection. It stores everything on their servers.  For anything else I pay $12 per year for their mobile client (I use android but it works on apple's phones too). It lets me log in via mobile and manage my passwords from my phone. I can also choose to view the password. This is how I log in to Netflix on my roku for example. I just look it up on my phone and type it in on the screen. Once I'm done I just log out of last pass mobile.  I never have it auto login so that if my phone gets lost or stolen they still need the master password to even access my shit.  Same thing with websites. I now manually log out of everything and everytime I visit the website lastpass gives me the option to autofill. I can even store multiple accounts on the same website and just choose which one I want it to fill in.  I'm super lazy and so it works great for me. Secrure randomly generated passwords and auto fill.

In its 2006 response, the International Astronomical Union (IAU), recognised by astronomers as the world body responsible for resolving issues of nomenclature, released its decision on the matter. This definition, which applies only to the Solar System, states that a planet is a body that orbits the Sun, is massive enough for its own gravity to make it round, and has ""cleared its neighbourhood"" of smaller objects around its orbit. Under this new definition, Pluto and the other trans-Neptunian objects do not qualify as planets. The IAU's decision has not resolved all controversies, and while many scientists have accepted the definition, some in the astronomical community have rejected it outright"""

As someone who uses the Internet who reads Wikipedia, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls dwarf planets planets. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""planet family"" you're referring to the mass object grouping of astronomical bodies, which includes things from satellites to asteroids to stars. So your reasoning for calling a dwarf planet a planet is because random people ""call the Pluto one a planet?"" Let's get minor planets and nebulae in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A dwarf planet is a dwarf planet and a member of the planet family. But that's not what you said. You said a dwarf planet is a planet, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all astronomical objects planets, which means you'd call asteroids, stars, and brown dwarfs planets too.

With the fall of Germany, the SS man, Wernher Von Braun,  who had been behind the A-4 ballistic missile (it reached an altitude of 100 kilometres, becoming the first human object to reach space), had to stop working for his own country, which was now completely destroyed, occupied and to soon be divided among the US and USSR spheres of influence (together with much of Europe). If he hoped to avoid war crime charges, he now had to work for the USA.  Erich Warsitz however refused to work for the USSR and was sentenced (for war crimes) to forced-labour.  The US and USSR ('untermechen' nations for the Germans) were now 'space-faring' superpowers and Erich Warsitz ...  ... who?"

Though, honestly- coming from experience here... the difference between a top level grappler and a low level grappler is a very huge gap. Considering he's not MUCH heavier than her the skill gap is large enough to completely negate the strength.   Not to mention that while on the ground all the strength would work against him rather than for him, when you don't know the inner workings of grappling you dont understand how to apply the right leverage."

That is staggering... The only advantage he will have is striking and he'll get one punch to KO her, maybe a 1-2 but that's it. She will not struggle at all to get hiim to the ground and wouldn't struggle with anything, not even his strength advantage. The only, only chance he would have is a short 5 second window to KO her and I wouldn't bet on that.   This fight would never happen but the odds are in her favor."

Well that's at least what I thought at the time. Turns out the ""deals "" we're in the stupid scroll bar and it was all terrible and I wasn't missing something as I had thought previously ended up being on 4 hours of sleep because of a sale ""better than Black Friday"" that was about as good as Black Tuesday."

reactiongifs,3dfg4o,TheImmortalLS,-8,Thu Jul 16 06:04:46 2015 UTC,My favorite was the fast one Amazon pulled on me. The Kingsman on Bluray for $9.99? Excellent. Add to cart.    Browsed the other deals for about thirty minutes and decided The Kingsman is all I'd get. Go to check out and the price went to $22.99. No thanks.
reactiongifs,3dfg4o,UnstoppableAwesome,18,Thu Jul 16 03:11:12 2015 UTC,That's cuz it probably sold out and went to regular price goofball.
reactiongifs,3dfg4o,myserg07,-3,Thu Jul 16 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"Hence, ""the fast one"".    Edit: Price changed to $7.00 off, instead of $20 off, and was marked as ""In Stock"". The sale price said ""9 hours remaining"", so I wasn't in much of a hurry to check out."
reactiongifs,3dfg4o,UnstoppableAwesome,3,Thu Jul 16 04:42:03 2015 UTC,The sale times doesn't mean they still have some in stock for that price. Once it sold out you could go to the wait list or buy at regular price the item didn't just go away.
reactiongifs,3dfg4o,myserg07,9,Thu Jul 16 04:56:49 2015 UTC,"You're both wrong. Once a ""deal"" is in your cart, you have 15 minutes to check out before it goes back to regular price."
