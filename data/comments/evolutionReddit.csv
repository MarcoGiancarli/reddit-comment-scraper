I'm not suggesting anyone do that, I think it would ruin the cause, and turn it into some sort of self-fulfilling prophesy... but... it's kind of like if at every single store you entered and an employee pointed at you and shouted ""Thief!!! You are a thief!!!"" and you got arrested for it every time, wouldn't you eventually just... start stealing shit anyway?"
