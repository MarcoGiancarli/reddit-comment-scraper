As I have become a more confident INFP, I have noticed that I am getting better at focusing outwards and respecting other's behaviors and ideas as being foreign and not entirely or necessarily filterable through my own view of the world."
infp,3e5335,cojamalo,2,Wed Jul 22 01:20:29 2015 UTC,This is a great reminder. I've lived exclusively in my own head for so long that I can barely remember that last several years.

infp,3e3uhz,Astrididdle,4,Tue Jul 21 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"I know what your saying. People cant see the context of why your including I'm sorry in front of your emphatic statements.   I think most people see ""I'm sorry"" purely as admittance to wrong doing whether in something said or done.  Simply putting ""I'm sorry"" back in the drawer and putting something like ""I know"" changes it dramatically.  People never like it when another individual is always apologizing or saying sorry even if it is meant in the INFP context your using there. It makes it look like your doubting yourself too much.  Show empathy if you want but find a way to word smith without using the ""apologize"" or ""I'm sorry"". Reserve those words for when it is actually necessary.  No amount of explaining is going to make someone understand these aspects of a feeler. If someone isnt going to get it intuitively they arent going to get it with explanation."

In a way I do it to show that I understand what they are going through and I empathize for them. But for me it's better than not apologizing and acting like i'm okay with what is going on. Saying sorry on the off chance that even a little bit was my fault. Saying ""I am sorry this is happening to you"" is the only way to express that feeling. It's like being on their side and agreeing that it is a messed up situation. I don't know if that answered your question, sorry I couldn't be much help. <-Damnit now i'm doing it."
infp,3e3uhz,Chizbang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:03 2015 UTC,It's like being on their side and agreeing that it is a messed up situation.   Exactly. I'm happy I'm not the only one.

Perhaps you could meet people who have similar interests to you at social places where you do your hobbies?

Coincidentally, they are both left handed and are the creative types (one being a graphic designer, the other makes clothes).   With both friendships, we didn't hit it off right away, which I imagine to be a typical INFP characteristic ( being comfortable with the person before really showing their true colors). Once those obstacles are crossed however, both relationships became the most rewarding relationships that I've ever had.   If you understand your MBTI type and you have a grip on who you are, then you're already connected to this person on a very deep level. To me, these two INFP friends are like different versions of myself. So I feel like whatever emotion I try to convey, no matter how nonsensical it is, they understand because they are a in a way, my reflection.   ""Do you ever..."" Types of conversations for life! I recommend everyone have at least one INFP friend if you're an INFP. This sub reddit doesn't count!"

infp,3e3nwl,bezald,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:16:16 2015 UTC,"My INFP and I have been together for four years. Our relationship is amazing. We look at other couples, and mutually agree how lucky we are to have a SO who just gets it. We don't fight often, we hardly ever have disagreements, but when we do it's easier for us to heal the conflict because we both know intuitively how the other is feeling. We also both understand each others need for personal space, quite often we'll just sit in a room together doing our own thing, and that will be more than enough to satisfy our need for alone time. I feel so respected and understood in this relationship! Back in our earlier days we used to have disagreements about stupid things like politics or anything deep topical related to our values. Then we realised we were always arguing for the same side, but from a different perspective! Don't let silly fights like that where your values are involved tear you apart, recognise that that is your Fi doing its thing.   I also agree what others have said. Communication is key. We communicate better than any other couple we know. Be free, honest and open with your partner! They can be insecure too!! I'd say just go for it, follow your feelings and give it a try. Make sure you give your crush space and time, but make your intentions clear. I was totally dense and didn't realise my INFP and I were dating and not just hanging out as friends, so be sure that you're both on the same page :) good luck!"

infp,3e1z17,ChimeraCheree,5,Tue Jul 21 11:57:55 2015 UTC,"Science isn't the end-all-be-all of qualifications.  Saying that Mozart was a better composer than Salieri doesn't have a scientific basis, and nor does saying that Lincoln had a secret life as a vampire hunter, but that doesn't mean both statements have equal validity.  MBTI has at least (some) common sense basis.  You answer a bunch of questions about yourself, and then there's a description that attempts to summarize your answers, and tells you about other people who have answered similarly.  AFAICT, astrology lacks even that."

He usually dismisses supernatural claims as being silly, wishful thinking, unless they happen to be related to the very specific religion he feels inclined to believe in and which he may be inclined to make part of his leisure activities.   I'm honestly not sure which types would be into Astrology concepts though :S"

We INFPs tend to idealise social interaction and if we fail to fullfill it, we get disappointed. As 16personalities said: INFPs tend to like the idea of social interaction but not the reality of it (that sentence really got me when I read it as it perfectly described how I felt).   Though I'm not isolated, I go out there with my group of friends even tho I usually leave there ""by empty hands"" (most of the time). Strangely even if I feel lonely in a group, I never want to leave, becouse I still seek connections. But when I connect with someone (usually one of my two best friends) I can leave happily, fullfilled.  So I don't feel lonely when I'm alone (must be a long time isolated until I feel alone). But I sure do sometimes feel alone in a big group of friends (sometimes it ends up me sitting in the corner looking tv with my glassed eyes thinking I didn't want this while someone asking me if I'm tired, lol)."

My dad asked me if I wanted to go to the Firemans retirement party and I spent the majority of the time just staring off into space. I got asked by my dads friend if I was tired and I just went along with it, easier than saying ""I'm not enjoying myself."" This also led into many ""back in my day"" stories of how they were always out drinking and with their friends etc and all I could think was ""that's nice, can I go and play Skyrim now?"""

I've been getting mood swings, probably caused by the constant schedule shifting."
infp,3e0pgk,JohannSebastianBlock,3,Tue Jul 21 03:27:37 2015 UTC,"I pushed away the closest friends I ever had with my anger. I tried to reconnect but it reared it's ugly head again when they touched on something I was sensitive about. I did just leave instead of lashing out, so I guess that's an improvement, but I'm once again alone.   Why don't you contact your friend and try to repair things?"
infp,3e0pgk,KthuluKat,3,Tue Jul 21 03:28:17 2015 UTC,Sure I do at times. I wish I could be more emotionally together at times but my situation doesnt allow it and I know its only partly a INFP thing.  My best friends were the best and at the same time it was more turbulent. Its like TV show. The first 4-5 seasons were solid to quite solid but as it got to 10-12 things just got harder to maintain and history haunts the continuity of the whole thing.  You could always try to reconnect though with the one friend. Might not be the same but its worth something if you really do miss em.
infp,3e0pgk,ChimeraCheree,3,Tue Jul 21 05:02:35 2015 UTC,"I prefer to be alone, or with just one other person (I tend to 'cling' to one really familiar person whenever I'm being more social), the people I become familiar with stay in my head all the time, like I have a social circle in my head of all of my true friends that I think about day and night. When this runs dry, that's when I start feeling lonely and I need to go out and connect to people again, which is very easy for me, I have multiple social circles that I can join and fit in with interesting people.  I suspect you just need more circles, if you have the energy and time, you can take up something new, like a new job or hobby and when you talk to people who you feel you will get along with, assume you are already best friends with them when you meet them for best results."

Otherwise you need to think how you breath, walk and talk as perfect as possible. I think we can choose to be perfectionist.   As for Buddhism, I just started so I don't like to say that I am one yet. Then again I have always been a 'natural' Buddhist. Now that I have vacation I can look into it, so that is what I have been doing lately. Anyways, thank you for asking!"

Some people argue that humanism and religion are separate (this is debatable) but humanism puts an emphasis on the well-being and also the capabilities of humanity, sometimes rejecting the presence of a deity and focusing on philosophical, scientific, and literary pursuits. Most humanists as far as I'm aware tend to be God-less, I guess you could say. And that isn't necessarily true for /INFP's."

The only other thing I can suggest is to figure out what common interests you and she share. Things you can do together or talk about. If you guys both like to read, then read the same book and discuss it as a fun project. You both like to bowl, then invite her to go bowling one night. You both like video games, then find a multiplayer game you can play together. I'm sure you'll think of something."

Try to read in the genre you want to write in too.  Then when you have an idea, expand on it a bit more until you've fleshed out the characters, plot, etc...and you'll (hopefully) have a story. Then write. You can either plan your entire story out chapter by chapter or wing it, but either way you just have to write. Write everything out first and then edit.  If you need ideas for plots, try /r/WritingPrompts, I Need a Prompt, or This site  Those are good for flash fictions or short stories.

There is no such thing as a ""feeler,"" everyone has feelings. xNTJs are probably going to be more receptive to your Fi, since most people who use Fe (especially as a more dominant function) will probably exhaust and frustrate us. I figure it would be the same for INFPs.   I don't think there's a ""best"" type, but it is good to find someone who balances you, regardless of type. So if you can't make plans, find a good xxTJ partner to help you get your planner together. If your emotions are unstable, find a partner who can bring you back down to earth. If you're too rigid, find someone who can help you relax. Etc. That's probably why xNTJ/INFP relationships are so popular, we're so opposite but somehow it works."

Just springing on them that you like them and want to take them out after being professional the whole time isnt going to cut it.  Make your intentions known. Press lightly. If she responds well keep working your way up to the invitation and share plans where you have something in mind to do regardless of whether you have company out not.

infp,3dyvnb,LeDispute,3,Mon Jul 20 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"HELLZ no.   I'll preface this my saying, I love my mother.  My mom made it a point to remind me of all my shortcomings.   I think she did the best with the tools that were provided to her.    I know she meant well, in some weird way.   And she loved us.  BUT, she had a really, really hard time expressing it.  Again, that goes back to how she was raised.  I never once heard my mom tell me I was pretty or smart.  I know, boo-hoo, right.   I'm not saying I had a bad childhood, because I didn't.   Just looking back now, as an adult and as a mother myself - I can see how it formed many of my insecurities and confidence issues.  And even though I tell my kids I love them, and how smart, kind, pretty, etc. they are all the time.  I'm sure I'll fuck something up along the way.   And hopefully, they'll forgive me and know I did my best.    Any when they have children one day, they can do a little better than I did.  And so on and so on."

When i left primary school (age 12 here in aus) I had the best results of my entire grade and won lots of awards. I remember when I was younger and we'd have weekly spelling tests and if i didn't get 100% I would almost be in tears.   On top of all of this I did really well in both swimming and dancing and got a lot of trophies for both. During high school I did well until the age of maybe 14/15. Everything suddenly felt extremely difficult. I was diagnosed with depression and it's like I lost whatever it was that made life so easy to get through. Ever since then I found it extremely hard to accept not being the best at things even though sometimes it feels like i'm giving more of myself to something then there is to give. Now I'm in university and I've made my way to a good school after transferring and it's something I'm really proud of, which I probably need to remind myself more often."

When I think of values I think of the real core stuff like 10 commandments stuff and all the regular truth/integrity/kindness aspects.  Abortion is a really difficult thing and I can see the Christian reasoning to it even though I'm pro choice as well. Not because so the men can get out of perceived responsibility but because its hard enough raising a child when you want one. To give the burden of life to someone without the proper nurturing is simply a travesty.  I think for me as long as the most important values are being shared and we can agree to disagree on the rest I'm fine being friends with them.
infp,3dztla,ChimeraCheree,2,Mon Jul 20 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yes and No.  I find it difficult when I encounter people with different values from me, even more so when they are close friends and family (which is the case for most of them for at least one thing). However I try my best not to judge people unless they have wronged me in a serious way, everyone is entitled to their opinions even if I don't agree with them. I'd rather have a good friendship with some differences rather than a bad one with fewer differences."

It's rough in the sense that it's clearly a depressing song, but it is well done.  Sorry to hear you're feeling down, OP. I've been really good these past 6 months, but I just had my 25th birthday this past week and now I can't shake this feeling like it's now or never for a lot choices in my life.   In college I dated a fair amount, for me at least, but I always had ""dry spells"" where I wouldn't date or have any physical contact with a female for months at a time. Currently, I'm at 2 years without a real date, like 13 months sexless. I'd like to think I'm actually a good person with good moral values and (hopefully) an attractive person, so I always struggle to figure out why I can't seal the deal so often. I find that I'm way too introspective on this stuff and when I'm thinking about it, it causes downward spirals in my moods and perpetuates everything. That's where I'm at right now.  I've been travelling internationally once or twice a year for the past 4-5 years now and it's been awesome. I love seeing Earth's different faces and hiking about and eating the foods of other cultures. This year, it doesn't look like that's going to happen. My biggest trip is to Colorado which is awesome, but I feel culturally trapped. I can't stop feeling like I need something very different in my life or these thoughts won't go away. I'm not sure where I'm going with this or why it brings me down so often, but I feel like I should live in another country for awhile. I want to move to Germany and go to soccer games (massive Bayern fan for years, have a tat to prove it), drink beer, meet the other half of my family, see the wonders of Europe!... but it terrifies me. It literally terrifies me. I'm on a career path that I don't enjoy right now and losing a sense of financial stability is something I've never felt before. I was never poor, but always low to mid-middle class. I still qualify as that now. I feel like dropping everything would be bad for my career... or do I try to find a job in Germany? How do I even do that?  I have no clue who to talk to about this which is probably why I am randomly spouting this off, so thank you OP... for whatever reason your song made me open up a little bit. I am a blatantly honest person about most things but I keep a lot of things internal, too. I think you cracked my shell. It seems an inordinate percentage of us have a lot of repressed feelings and think too much. Maybe someone can help? Maybe I helped you? I don't know, but thank you."

I too feel trapped occasionally by school. I recently switched from the ""smart"" CIS major to history. And it was a brash decision, I was halfway in CIS, but I feel like it was still the right choice. If I was to have done it, I would have never been happy. Not to say I am now. Obviously, life is complicated and sometimes you have to do things you don't want to in order to survive. But ask yourself why you dislike your job and why you want to leave. Is it impulse or the consequence of something deeper that will make you miserable for the rest of your life."

I told my mom I was miserable, and she kept convincing me to stick it out. Now, here I am in an industry I don't want to be in doing a job I have no interest in all because I kept convincing myself that it is something I need to do, rather than want to do. I'm glad to hear you made a decision siding towards something you enjoy. I wish I had. Partially though, I know living elsewhere is easier with a tech degree than without so that's one positive beam in all of this.

I’m passive because a lot of the time, I just don’t give a fuck about something. If you ask me where I want to eat and I say I don’t care, it’s really because I don’t care, and I’d be happy to let someone pick.

People who pre-plan every part of their days and don't know how to roll with the flow or leave any free time to just let whatever happens happen.  People who insist on filling silence or stillness with music or tv shows or foot tapping or small talk or gum smacking or other bodily squirming or restlessness.  People who have large dogs and don't train them to be polite or put out any effort to apologize when their animal misbehaves.  (I'm not as put off by smaller dogs, I just think a big animal requires more discipline.)  People who only talk and do not listen.  Aka narcissists.  People who don't ever doubt themselves.  Obviously it's a spectrum... you can doubt yourself too much, but the right amount of self-doubt is indicative of a healthy mind at least to me.  People who have ""savage"" qualities when they are out in public.  They're wild, untamed, uncivilized.  If a rock star is on stage acting a fool that is one thing, but to go into a restaurant or to a store and just fill the place with your presence to the point of ruining the vibe - that's what kills me.

Or I don't know, when people are being genuinely polite and the other party isn't reciprocating, it drives me nuts. Doesn't necessarily have to directly involve me. Like if I'm at the grocery store and the kind teenager employee bagging someone's groceries extends a ""Have a good day!"" and say, that person doesn't address it or sends his thanks, in my head I'm judging them a bit and calling them animals. Haha. And not /INFP related but when I see the use of should ""of"" versus should ""have"", I wilt a bit on the inside. I'm probably an asshole. But honestly, the usual.

infp,3dw3hp,somethingboringggg,11,Mon Jul 20 00:44:42 2015 UTC,Maybe he likes that your different from him. Maybe you have a calming effect on him.   Sometimes the best couples are the ones that have enough differing traits to keep it interesting and promote personal growth but not enough to cause huge rifts in understanding.  Personable. Kind. Supportive. Immensely romantic at times. Immensely creative at times. Can appreciate novelty and the little things. We want harmony overall and think its worth fighting for. We can put ourselves in other peoples shoes.  What is boring? What is exciting? Its all in the perspective. I think most people arent all that exciting most of the time. It takes the pressure off. Its not a contest. You shouldnt feel the need to perform regardless of how great the other person or group is.
infp,3dw3hp,ChimeraCheree,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:19:59 2015 UTC,yah maybe - we are similar but different.  It's just that everyone loves him - he is charismatic and popular.  Doesn't he want to date his 'equal'?

infp,3dw3hp,jimjones1233,10,Tue Jul 21 05:03:22 2015 UTC,"I (f) made friends with this extroverted, hilarious, popular guy in college. I couldn't figure out why he'd always call my name and run over to me when we'd see each other outside, and walk with me to our class we had together, making jokes and being so friendly. I liked it, but honestly had no idea why he was always so cool to me, I felt plain and closed off a lot of the time.   But one day out of the blue he told me he thought I was cool to talk to because I was a good listener, made him feel like he could speak his mind and didn't think I would judge him.  What? I felt like all I did was smile and say hi, subtly encourage whatever he was excited about at the moment, and enjoy his energetic persona. I was just being myself so that made me feel really good."
infp,3dw3hp,jimjones1233,3,Mon Jul 20 03:03:43 2015 UTC,This sounds like a lot of people that I was friends with. They were fun and people gravitated towards them and yet they'd come talk to boring old me.

infp,3dw3hp,jimjones1233,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:12:59 2015 UTC,so they want a listener?
infp,3dw3hp,jimjones1233,2,Mon Jul 20 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"That's part of it. They want someone that will listen and allow them to direct the conversation. Personally, I think I'm very boring. I rarely come up with fun topics to discuss or express my unique thoughts out loud. However, I'm great at reassuring someone that their topic is fun and engaging. I can allow them to have a conversation out loud and add insight or tid-bits they might enjoy without changing the course of the conversation. Does that make any sense? Pretty much I am a boring person but some people entertain themselves enough that they want someone that is a bit 'boring'. Maybe it's just a different kind of person that might seem boring but with a bit of prompting can bring the best out of them. At least that's the way I have seen it with some of my friendships."

infp,3dw3hp,ericwilldiesoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:11:01 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, I don't know. But I don't think most people think about it like I do. I think he probably sees you as a great person that he enjoys being around. He probably doesn't see you as a secondary person. Different people desire all types of personalities. One person may see you as not equal but he definitely can. In the end, you need to just let it play out. If you stop liking it, end things. If he stops liking you, he will end things. In between that you just need to try and have fun, if not you will doom the relationship either way. My worst relationships have been with people I think are too good for me. I start to worry about everything I say or do. It makes something that could have been great fail miserably. Stop worrying about it and if you think you are boring try and work on your social skills in a way you think is productive. Maybe look for fun new activities you can take up together and learn together. That creates bonds that are stronger than anything and inside jokes that are unique to you two. Good luck."

We like it more when you help the relationship along.  Second, we like people and don't like them at the same time, it sounds weird, but it basically means that we love to have intimate relationships with people, but we need our space after a while, so dont become to upset when we're clingy or distant.  And finally, we are probably some of the best people to be partners with, sure others have their pros, but we are more connected and down to earth with our partners, and we can assure a lifetime of happiness and love if you mend our hearts right.

infp,3dvzoo,throwawayentjaccount,5,Mon Jul 20 00:09:57 2015 UTC,"She did what she felt she needed to before your relationship went to shit. When either of you break radio silence, prepare to offer your unconditional support in her becoming a more independent individual. It's likely become a matter of dignity to her.  As for her indelicately stating her thoughts out loud to you of leaving home and letting you sizzle overnight with it, obviously it was a mistake that hurt you. Let her know that you care deeply for your life together and that affected your behaviour."
infp,3dvzoo,Kopernic,4,Mon Jul 20 01:20:08 2015 UTC,"The short answer:  You can't win her back. If you get back together, it won't be because you won her back.  Believe her words: I need to go away from here. And when I say believe, I mean respect the need as legitimate and do not create the ""perfect circumstances"" to make her feel like she needs to be with you. If you do the conventional things to win back an ex, she will see that as a lack of respect. You probably don't want to lose her respect.  Possibly, see a therapist. Find out how you contributed to the stress in the relationship.  After several months, or even a year, contact her to ask how she is doing. Do not send an apology, a long letter, or provide a large gesture. Let her response guide you, rather than your own pre-determined plans.  Be okay if she takes awhile to respond. Be okay if she doesn't respond.  The more you do, the more likely you will fail. She will be suspicious of you. So spend some time alone, and let her do the same.  Good luck.

infp,3duw83,Pyrate_Endustrees,4,Sun Jul 19 18:34:47 2015 UTC,"I know that this seems like a big deal right now, but that has more to do with the still-lingering freshness and convincing nature of the dream, and less to do with your ex. As convincing as dreams are, they are essentially what your mind has consolidated during the day. You are probably so worried about your ex finding someone else that you are finding yourself dreaming about it becoming a reality. I've done this plenty of times before myself.  I had an ex who did similar things with me. Even after the break up, he would accuse me of seeing other people -- people who I hardly hung out with. Most of these accusations came from dreams he had where the person in question and I were dating. As you can imagine, this quickly became annoying, and eventually I had to cut him out of my life completely for the sake of us both. He took great offense to this, but I think that he will someday understand why I did it.  And so I would encourage you to think about the situation as if it were happening to somebody else. As real as a dream feels, in the end, it is just a dream. It is only a reflection of what you think about, nothing more than that. And if your ex is telling you that she's not seeing someone right now, I think it makes sense to believe her. After all, you're no longer together, so she has nothing to hide from you in the first place. And if she feels she has to lie to you in order to protect your happiness, that it saying something about how you two are interacting with each other, don't you think?  I'd also keep in mind that even though it feels horrible right now, you have to remember that your ex is her own person now, and she has the right to date whoever she wants. So even if she did end up dating this guy (which doesn't seem likely to be happening right now), it isn't your place to accuse her of anything.  I hope you understand where I am coming from. Once the emotions pass, I don't want you to end up regretting anything you may say or do. It is good to keep relationships with your ex on good terms.

But when he would text her continually before we broke up, call her continually, and when she spent less time at home and more time ""with a client,"" I knew something was up. It's a little bit of both, I feel. She did admit that they've gone on a date. I'm just trying to find answers. I need to stop thinking she's my best friend anymore and just move on. it's hard; i miss her. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to now, and we were each other's rock. we understood each other and how the other thought. that's all gone now. im just having a hard time. thanks for the support."
infp,3duw83,Schlitterschuh,2,Sun Jul 19 19:19:10 2015 UTC,"I understand. I think the best thing to do is to just let the chips fall where they may with her, and to be her friend again after some time has passed and the wound isn't as fresh. It won't be easy, especially when they were your best friend. My ex (not the one I mentioned in my previous post) is an ENTJ and he used to be my best friend. We don't talk much now that we are broken up, but I think that this is partially because I let him do his own thing and ended up having a lot of great experiences on my own, meeting wonderful new people along the way. I think that the tables turned once he saw me doing so well without him, and I think that there's a part of him that regrets ending the relationship, and so he sometimes puts himself in situations where he can visit or interact with me (instead of the other way around). When he does, we end up staying up all night talking just like old times. I don't know the circumstances in which you live or the behavioral tendencies of your ex aside from her being an INTJ, so I'm not saying that this will necessarily happen to you. But I do think that the best way to handle a break up is to put yourself in positions where you can feel supported and happy, and to live as if you were the one who is doing fine. Because after a bit of time (not immediately, unfortunately, but in time), it will become a reality. I wish you the best of luck!"

I had trouble sleeping for a while, and when I did finally return to a normal sleep pattern, I had a dream. In the dream, my SO and I were in a dark server room, and at the end of one of the shelves of servers was a file cabinet. We were both tearing through the paper files, searching for what went wrong. That's what I kept saying, ""what went wrong? What went wrong? It's not here! What could've happened?""  When I woke up, I felt absolutely miserable. However, after time I realized that while there was nothing in my mind-cabinet about why things turned sour, there's also nothing in there about why we should've stayed together. Eventually my dreams became more cathartic, when she did appear in them.   Things will get better, yo. It takes time. Dreams are a way for our mind to process traumatic things."

And when it arrives  not a soul will be outside  because there is danger  to be found in such a storm.  But a voice can be heard.  “I love you, don’t go.” it whispers.

Perhaps it makes us less fearful when we encounter something that is more dissimilar to us.  Look I'm a minority myself and I'll be honest even beyond being a INFP and thinking myself to be some sort of maverick/outcast I know being a minority is at the core of why I dont feel American at all. At the same time I dont feel any kinship to my ancestral country either. I'm basically a nationality orphan in my mind.  Other people hold strongly in where there family comes from and others hold strongly about being American as well.  Thing is things have changed in some respects. I've seen ads cater to Asians more in recent years. Nothing I would have ever fathomed. We see a Indian woman headlining a show. A Asian family sitcom and soon another comedy show centering around the Korean actor from Hangover.  I think it always becomes what you make of it. I've seen more well to do blacks that come from more Academic backgrounds and I never get the impression that they feel isolated or slighted by their surroundings. Thats my take anyway.  You guys have some of the greatest inventors of the past. Some of the greatest civil activists as well.  I'll admit though that in the media there is some idea of more acceptable black and less acceptable black. I only say this with the idea of people bleaching their skin or lightening it to be more ""sellable"" and seeing how some actresses and actors fit better into the realm of acting alongside white actors as opposed to being in blackcentric movies exclusively outside of lesser roles. The idea of this isnt cut and dry but you know what I mean.  The stereotype of blacks is always going to be perpetuated in some form. I think its hard for this country to practice tolerance as it is. Total acceptance is something dreams are made off and I wish I could have a slice of that in my life time for society as a whole."

Hell, people of my nationality are often (incorrectly) seen as prideful of their whiteness, so I've been often indirectly accused of that myself, despite the fact that it makes no sense when applied to me.

My whole life I've been upper middle class.  I am white. I am American.  But, by all means I fucking hate America. Seriously.  If there is a side of my being that I cling to, it's my Japanese roots. Or just the idea that I cling to nothing and would simply love to move out of the U.S. I'd go to Germany, mainly because it's a great place to live, but because I'm an 18th German.   The truth is, white culture is stupid. At least in America. So, American white culture is stupid.  Obviously Europe is a HUGE part of the world and the worlds history.  But technically, white people are not the dominant race. Asians make up most of the world. And there are a heck of a lot of black people too.  White people are just the richest and most powerful on average.  That doesn't mean shit, they got it handed down to them on a silver platter. And now, they hold the platter and they choose he next king, queen or CEO.   You obviously aren't arguing about skin color. Your mad about culture. Black culture vs white culture. That's a legit battle.  We have a back president. But... I mean. He acts super white. So what's the difference?   You need to understand things.  If you come to r/Intj and see white People, you can be mad about that. But understand why.  How many black teens living in a ghetto are gonna read Jung? Probably like one in a million, literally.  How many white suburban emo kids will read it? A lot more.  Reddit forms are white culture.  We can't see your skin on here. So anyone could be typing.

infp,3dubei,KennyLannister,12,Sun Jul 19 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"I'm an INFP who works as a programmer in my university's virtual reality lab. This means that I spend time working on 3D modeling and building virtual landscapes for the Oculus Rift. Since I do this for my university, I am creating worlds that can be used for social psychology experiments, rather than games, which is a perfect fit for me as an INFP.  I've taken a variety of computer science courses in college, and I can confidently say two things about them. One: I'm nowhere near as good at 'getting' programming as my fellow Te types are, but two: they have all been deeply fascinating classes that fed my Ne with seemingly endless possibilities.  I've found that graphics are (for me) the most boring part. I've much preferred the data mining / web app building stuff. But my favorite thing (strangely enough) has been looking at algorithms. It's so neat to know how many different ways there are to search and sort something, and the idea of 'recursion' and 'recursive backtracking' absolutely blows my mind. I love to use reversion wherever I can because it's often so elegant.  Ironically, my favorite class I've taken so far has been theoretical computer science. I was absolute shit at it for the most part, but I absolutely loved it. It's so cool to see how the world works, and how computers mimic the world (and the human brain, for that matter) in simple ways.  I love CS, and though I often want to give up on it out of sheer frustration, I always end up coming back to it and getting excited about it. You might think of programming as just sitting in a cubicle, but understand that what you should be doing as a programmer (and an INFP) is working on a project you love. For example, I'm interested in mental health and psychiatry, and so I am working on revising the mental health directory at my school. Right now it is messy and hard to navigate, but because I know SQL and how to navigate a database, I can make it a lot easier. And then it feels infinitely more rewarding.  I'd warn you against jumping into it right away, though. Take a few classes (if possible) before deciding that you want to go down that path. It's a lot of burn out if you spend all your time doing it, even for Te types. My ex is an ENTJ and even he got burnt out after working as a programmer for a summer -- they make you work super hard and for long hours at those big-name companies. I might minor in CS, but I don't think that I could major in it. Though I have been considering getting a master's degree in it, so who knows.  Either way, don't let the INFP stereotype dissuade you. If you're interested in it, you'll become very good at in time. The initial hump is kind of challenging, but once you learn the fundamentals, you've done pretty much 75% of the work. Best of luck, and let me know if you have more questions, or are curious about my experiences as a programmer and an INFP. My experience has also been a bit shaded by the fact that I'm a female programmer. I've encountered a lot of subtle and not-so-subtle dismissal in the programming world for my gender, which I wasn't expecting before I went into it. But I think that this has to do with the fact that, in the USA (where I'm from), people tend to associate talent with innate ability rather than hard work and motivation. And so since a stigma against females in STEM already exists, it is reinforced in certain ways. The only reason I bring this up is because I do think that it has (at times) lessened my confidence in my coding abilities, and in programming, a certain confidence (and even arrogance) can be extremely helpful in regards to how much you think you can learn."
infp,3dubei,Schlitterschuh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:57:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks this was extremely helpful :)  I know I have the opportunity to be creative in this field which is great. My only worry is I want to do something meaningful and have a positive impact on someone's life. It doesn't have to be directly helping them, it can even be improving their experience using something.   Anyway, I'm going to keep researching!"
infp,3dubei,Schlitterschuh,2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:03 2015 UTC,":) Glad to hear it. I'd like to point out that, insofar as helping people goes, CS has the largest implications over any field I've seen thus far. You wouldn't know it, though, because the people who are drawn to CS aren't usually drawn to it out of a desire to contribute to social good. But if the world saw a 25% increase in INFP programmers, there would be a staggering change in the quality of life around us. I can't emphasize this enough without writing a massive, essay-length post. As an example, I volunteer in a psychiatry building in my spare time, and one thing we have to do is punch in data so that the results of neurocognitive experiments can be analyzed. Once we analyze the results, we can begin to understand how children with developmental disorders differ from children who don't have these disorders. It takes a long time to punch in all the data, but with a Python script (that takes less than a day to write), you can get the computer to put it all in for you. Simple things like that are just minuscule examples of the power of CS, but hopefully they help you see the benefit of learning even a little bit of programming. Best of luck!"

infp,3dubei,redearth,4,Mon Jul 20 17:33:24 2015 UTC,"We are not very analytical   This isn't true. There are lots of INFPs with the right kind of analytical skills for computer programming, and contrary to what one might guess, these kinds of abilities are more strongly correlated with I and N types than it is with T types. But there's lots of variation amongst INFPs, so only you can figure out whether you as an individual have the right kinds of analytical skills, or whether you can acquire them if you don't.   I'm just worried when I start looking for jobs I'll be stuck in a cubicle doing mundane work.   This has less to do with the profession you choose and more to do with the particular job and/or company you work for. As an INFP, it will probably be very important to you do work that you find meaningful (whether it's the task itself or the greater goals of the project), and to have a good working environment. This means having good relationships with your coworkers, your boss, and anyone else you work with. Also, keep in mind that many programming jobs allow for non-traditional working environments (i.e. not cubicles), ranging from working at home to open concept offices. The better a programmer you are, the more in demand you will be, so the more power you will have to negotiate the terms of your work to your liking.  tl;dr: Many INFPs can program. Working conditions matter a lot; finding a good workplace will usually have more impact on your happiness than what work you do."
infp,3dubei,cruxclaire,2,Sun Jul 19 16:37:36 2015 UTC,"We are not very analytical   Eh, I'm not sure MBTI personality types are a good indicator of aptitude for programming or analysis in general. Don't let the INFP type description become a self-fulfilling prophecy for your weaknesses.   I'd say 2-3 hours is probably not enough time to determine whether or not steering your life in that direction is a good fit or not. It might be a good idea to look into a free intro course on something like EdX or read some introductory texts/books (there has to be some kind of Programming for Dummies book written in a straightforward way). After that, if it's something you can see yourself doing for 8 hours a day in the future, then I'd say go for it."

I never get tired of coding- it is amazing solving new challenges. Learning coding is like learning a language- except it's learning the language that computers use! You use a computer almost every day, and definitely every day if you love smartphones. Learning how they ""talk"" or run commands is fascinating to me, and I love being able to construct anything I'd want to do on a computer. The language isn't much different than ours, when you code with a programming language. You just have to learn things like ""cout"" or ""isValid"" or other small, shorthand words based off of English. I also love digital art and editing digital art, for good measure.  What I will forewarn you on is the sheer amount of math involved in this field. You will have to do Algebra I, II, Trigonometry, Calculus I, II, and then the kicker- Differential Equations. Differential Equations is what I'm taking now, and it's extremely hard. It is literally the entirety of Calculus II, plus Calc I and plenty of Algebra, wrapped into complex equations and matrices. Matrices are easy in the beginning, but they go down the rabbit hole fast. I'd strongly suggest that if you are like me, and struggle in math, to find a math tutor or get a friend who's good in math to help you early on. Other than the math- it is amazing. :)"

Hmph. Maybe you don't need a girl to 'drag you out' of anything or bring out the happier parts of you, and maybe thinking that you do need romance for that is what's hurting your chances. Maybe those are the parts of ourselves that we need to find on our own. And then romance comes next almost naturally.  But in another vein, I also definitely idealize people like crazy. It's like I create this story in my mind of who I think someone is and then instead of paying attention to who they really are, I just find myself concerned with how they're perceiving me. Sometimes being idealistic and imaginative is fun and exciting, but I'm trying to remember (sometimes) that real life isn't like the movies or a novel. And that's alright, too."
infp,3du1we,scarlet___begonias,6,Sun Jul 19 14:00:27 2015 UTC,You cant wait for a girl to drag it out of you. With that said I met one or two girls that could bring out the inner Casanova in me.  Problem is that its inconsistent and the way a girl generally makes a move is a stark contrast to how a boy does it. A girl makes herself more approachable. She may put herself in your sphere of presence. She may interject on a conversation your having with a group or one on one with someone else.  You need to learn to tap into your social grace/power. Most women are willing to only do so much and I feel that they perceive rejection in much subtler ways than men do because their approach whether more aggressive or more passive is still very subtle compared to men.  Us INFP men need to use better bait as fisherman. We cant use bait that we have to spend hours and hours waiting for one possible tussle. We have to put the work in.

infp,3du1we,techslaves,2,Mon Jul 20 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"Here's my story of how I was almost 20 with my first kiss and... not as old as some but it sure felt like a long time. You need some real ego strength for most women to be attracted to you.  When I was young I put all my energy into school and my social circle. It was exhausting and I quickly failed college.   That freed me to drive west when I was 18, a glorious age for a young man. Away from my family and almost all of the people I used to know, I naturally developed the attitude of ""I don't give a shit"" that Redditors aspire for. I learned my limitations, of which there were few, and I made hundreds of friends, including some very close whom I miss deeply since we lost touch.   I was 19, skinnier than ever (I'm big boned), with dirty blonde hair down to my waist, and renting a bed in a hostel in a new city. I was friendly with everybody when I met her. I was happy with myself. I was still weird but it was an international hostel, so maybe they all didn't know what a head case I am.  She was also from afar, N.Z.   I wasn't looking for romance, that is the key. I just liked her and she thought I was fun to be with. On the third day or so I initiated contact, a back massage when she was cooking on the stove. She looked around, we were alone, she turned around and kissed me. That was it. We lived together for several months after that. I always moved in together with my SOs.   My only advice is don't live together. It's too convenient and you compromise personal development. See each other, but keep a separate living space until you're self-sufficient. Not that I have regrets, but I'd do it that way.   Edited out some puritan stuff that seeped into my last paragraph."
infp,3du1we,thundermanbearpig,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much the same. I however idealise them in my head though, pretty much create an image (or images/ fake memory) of them in my head and fall in love with the idea of them, knowing that it's not gonna be true, its not going to be that perfect. I think it's a common trait between us INFP that we all, in one way or another, long for a companion.   I have however tried and ask out a couple of girls, however I only have one girlfriend thus far and that was because we were really young (15). The idealisation of girls destroyed many of my relationship as well as I can't stop thinking of them as a romantic target or whatever. This led to me avoiding them after I they reject my attempt of asking them out or when I see that whatever that was going on isn't going to be anything.   I am in no position to give any advice because I am as hopeless as you are but here's what I'm trying: not thinking about it. Right now I am trying to experience and try and see as many things as I possibly can, along the way I hope to meet new people. Basically close your eyes and move forward and be hopeful that you'll bump into someone worthwhile. Of course there's still going to be challenges along the way and there will probably moments when you contemplating about asking this girl out but you're scared but by then I hope somehow I know I have to do it and somehow the feelings, emotions and possibility outweigh the fear and just go for it."

But if you really think about it, when you have that kind of attitude...  Are you not willfully limiting yourself?? Are you not putting yourself inside a box?? Humans are malleable and we can strengthen our weak points while still playing to our strengths. If people similar to you are sharing things that have been beneficial to them, but you flat out reject it, where is that going to leave you??  I promise I'm not trying to be negative or abrupt, I'm doing my best to be gentle. I just feel so strongly about the fact that so many people blatantly refuse to step outside of what they think they are. And is that not the underlying message of your post? You don't like that people are a certain way and unwilling to even try to change?   I had my so called ""coming of age"" in the drug world. Things are terrible in the drug world. But I have an understanding of humanity that I wouldn't have otherwise had, had I not been through what I've been through. I came to understand that many people (not all, but many) are a product of their environment. If you had a family that was involved in organized crime, and your whole life ""putting in work"" was held in high esteem, when you're a child are you not going to be somewhat impressionable and begin to follow the same path? I have so many people I could use as an example, but I'll only talk about one of them for now. Let's call him ""Bob"" though that isn't his real name.  Bob was the product of people involved in a lot of illegal activities, and he himself also participated in such things. When he was 16 he got incarcerated and part of his punishment was being prohibited from being in the city we lived in til he was 18, because he bashed a guys skull in. The same guy sold all sorts of drugs, smoked a bunch of rocks and did a lot of bad things. Armed robberies, you name it, everything except murder pretty much. The same guy got really drunk and went up to 4 gang members at a bar and pulled a big knife on them and waved it in their faces, which didn't turn out very well for him.  However, after all this, this same person is one of the only people I've never had a problem with. He's looked out for me, he's been there for me, he's cared about me. The same person to tell me ""I love you bro"", (do you know how many thugs say things like that? Hardly any) The same person to give me a big hug any time he comes and visits me now. Why did he do all those bad things if he's really a nice guy deep down? Because at the time, that life was all he'd ever known.   And that's what it comes down to. This stupid, ridiculous, backwards way of living is all these people have ever known. Yes, some of them are smart enough to realize what's up and they don't do anything about it, I don't approve of that, but what you have to realize is the majority of people in our society are sheep. Impressionable. Manipulate-able. I won't even go into conspiracy stuff here but look into Horace Mann and the North American education system, it was built for the sole purpose of conditioning the masses, and controlling them, teaching blind subservience. Not everyone is like us. They're not able to see past the illusion their living in, and if we don't do anything to help them see it, are we not pretty much making sure that nothing improves?  Again I apologize if I come across as hostile, I promise I'm not, I just can't not say something at this point in my life and I also feel like a younger me would appreciate someone telling me like it is.

I personally prefer NTJ types because they have what I don't have (if that makes sense), but I think that NFP types 'get' me more. It all depends on what you're looking for. My ENFP ex was a LOT more emotional than I was, and a lot more spiritual, too. He was also a lot more adventurous and needed more attention. By contrast, my ENTJ ex hardly needed attention and wasn't very adventurous or emotional. He spent a lot of time working, and our conversations were usually intellectual in nature rather than emotional. My ENFP would take me to romantic cities, make me CDs, make me breakfast in bed, decorate the house in all my favorite things, always hold the door open for me, etc. He thrived off of seeing me happy. My ENTJ didn't do any of that, really, but instead he'd do practical things for me (like if I needed a mechanic for something, he'd do all of it for me). He also liked to tutor me in subjects that I struggled with, and basically have me material to learn how to be more practical and self-sufficient on my own. I think that most INFPs would prefer the former to the latter, but another thing to keep in mind is that the person who gives more is usually the person who needs more. My ENTJ could go weeks without sex or sexual reciprocation, but my ENFP was offended if I ever refused it out of tiredness, etc, and he needed it all the time. I think that a happy medium for an INFP is to find someone who loves them unconditionally, yet rationally. As it turns out, the fairytale kind of intensity in relationships comes with a host of other problems, and in the end an INFP can really benefit from a level-headed yet devoted kind of love."

infp,3drn8p,kk5,10,Sat Jul 18 20:10:54 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I can share some of my coping techniques, and maybe it will be of some help. Us INFPs feel so much, and I know it's hard sometimes.   When going through tough situations, I try to remember that there's no ""right"" way to react or to feel. Allow yourself to feel whatever it is you feel, and feel it completely, no matter how painful it is. Or, it might not be painful as you thought it would be, and you don't need to feel guilty about that. Meditation is helpful for me, as it helps me stay in my body, and find a sense of calm somewhere within me to keep me going. Try to be kind to your body and give it what it needs - rest, nutritional food - while your emotions are processing this. It takes a lot of energy.   Just keep moving forward. Sometimes it's helpful to reach out to others, but I know I need to process things internally first. I also have trouble with feeling pity from others. I'm picky about who I share with, but I think it's good to let it out at some point - don't want to get too stuck in your own head (and posting here was definitely a good way to get out of your head for a moment). I also journal a lot. Anything that will allow those emotions to fully run through me without resistance.   I'm hoping you can find some peace."

infp,3drn8p,dirtywood,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:15:48 2015 UTC,"I recently had a childhood hero of mine die. He was a mentor to me and to many other children in my area growing up. I wanted to pay tribute to him, and so I wrote out my thoughts on his passing -- and his legacy -- in a very verbose Facebook post, highlighting his influence on me and those around me. I typically write in a very self-aware manner, and I am fairly in-tune with my emotions when I write (in a way that doesn't glorify them or exaggerate them), and so when I ended up posting to Facebook, I had an overwhelming response to the post. I had people messaging me telling me that they, too, were struggling with their mentor's passing, and they hadn't known how to deal with their sadness. They said that my post gave them peace. I also had people who didn't know the person I had dedicated my post to, but had lost a similar father figure before and had felt similar emotions and loss, and reading my post had given them peace, as well.  I now know that this is one of the INFP's special gifts. I have always admired Shakespeare, because I think that he is very adept at describing human emotions in a way that any human can relate to. You will always find people who are prominent or successful in their fields, but I always say that the only person who could relate to the CEO of Yahoo is the CEO of Google. That is why successful folk often hang primarily around successful folk like them. But those who are willing to be vulnerable -- and those who have felt loss -- can relate to the broad range of humanity. This is because everyone understands vulnerability and loss. This is also why I believe that INFPs can befriend almost anyone, even the underdog.  I guess what I'm getting at is that the most helpful way to deal with a loss is to channel the emotions into building a tribute, or helping out others who have felt the same way as you. Because as real as your emotions are right now, you aren't the only one who has felt them -- not even close. People all over the world currently feel (or have felt) the loss of their best friends, and just like you, they don't know how to cope with it. They could really benefit from someone emotionally-aware to put things into perspective for them. And this is a lot more helpful than simply dwelling in the sadness, which is a common thing for younger INFPs to do before they've become more self-aware and self-actualized.  Best of luck to you, and I'm sorry for your loss."
infp,3drn8p,Schlitterschuh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. This was actually the second thing I did as soon as I could calm myself down enough after I originally wrote this post here. The outreach has been helpful for not only me, but for other people who loved him as well. Since I got it all written down though, I had felt an extreme numbness. I actually spent most of yesterday just laying on the floor and staring at the ceiling with a blank mind, because it hurt too much to think about Rory.    I keep going back to thinking about what his last days must have been like, or what he had to be feeling when he did it. I know I shouldn't, and it's detrimental to my well being, but I'm just trying to understand. So many things keep reminding me of him since I spent the last year of my life living with him, and it makes me happy, upset, and right now, I'm extremely angry.     I look back at our last messages to each other and there are NO signs of anything that would suggest how unhappy he was. I know many people hide it, I know I do, but right now it makes me really angry that he didn't even at least try to hint that he needed help. My last two messages to him were saying how I missed him and wanted to visit him soon or plan a visit to see me last week, and it's been gnawing at me that I should have tried harder. If he had come to see me when planned, he would have been here with me that night.    I also keep finding little reminders of how he must have planned to do this. We shared a Netflix account all year, and he randomly cancelled it on Thursday. He posted a really nice picture of himself on Facebook on Thursday that me, along with many other people, liked and commented on since he doesn't post often. He then deleted his account sometime between then and when he decided to do it.     I'm sorry this turned into a big rant, but I needed to get this off of my chest. I don't like for people I know to see me upset, and the people here in the town I live in now don't know him and I feel weird mentioning him because I don't want to break down in front of anymore people.     Thank you so much everybody for your support, you are my heroes."
infp,3drn8p,Schlitterschuh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"Rory's death sounds like something that he had been planning out for a long while. I am sure that he had been immersed in suicidal thoughts for longer than anyone had realized -- perhaps even years. I don't think that it could have been stopped had you 'tried harder' to reach him. I think he might have resigned himself to the fact that he was going to do it, and didn't think to reach out for help because he had made the decision long ago. As horrible and heartwrenching as it is, I hope you understand that there is nothing that you could have or should have done that you weren't already doing.  When someone makes an internal decision to end their life, it is hard to reverse that decision. The best thing you can do is inspire those around you, and to help them realize how joyful life can be on a day-to-day basis. That way, they never have those thoughts to begin with.  It may have been too late for Rory, but there are plenty of other people out there who are prone to depression and can benefit from your friendship and encouragement. I think that Rory would have loved to know that his legacy inspired you to approach the people in your life with an eye towards their well-being. This will also give you an experience that allows you to connect with those who have gone through similar losses. Sometimes, the unfortunate loss of one person creates a ripple effect that builds a whole world's worth of good, and if you choose to plan the trajectory of your future around that notion instead of the notion that you could have done something yourself, then I think you (and possibly many other people) will feel a lot better in the future."

Where to begin with The Cure...  Disintegration, for starters - it's considered to be their very best. Their early, moody post-punk efforts like Seventeen Seconds and Faith are really good, really dreary. Pornography is so dark, it is suffocating and relentless, and it has my highest recommendation. However, I do love The Head on the Door (I have a signed copy!) and Wish, which have their bleak moments, but are overall more cheerful efforts. You asked an INFP for recommendations of her favorite band, so I will tell you that everything is worth a listen, and picking a favorite is nigh impossible.  The Devil and God...is another album that has that bleakness I love so much. It just consumes you."

Maybe the start was underproduced, or is it intentional? Anyway it gets better and better as it goes on and, needless to say, I like it.  Will have to give a few more listens, of course.

Yeah, I've been called weird and was bullied quite a bit in my younger years for a lot of the same reasons you talked about. I always found solace within my small tight-knit group of friends (and of course my books).  Her quiet and kind demeanor certainly does make her a target, and will more than likely continue to be a target for most of her life (lets be honest about corporate America, they don't really dig us idealists and dreamers and it's way too easy for us to get bulldozed since we often lack externalized ambition).  I think it's those qualities that make her so special though. My only advice would be to continue to reassure your daughter that she is incredibly special (AKA constant flow of loving validation) and that it's okay for her to not fit in with most people.   I'm sure your daughter is a beautiful soul who is full of ideas, imagination, and love. The only advice I'd have towards her is that she needs to learn how to retreat behind her imagination-shield; that there is an entire universe insider her head of her own design (whether she really knows it or not) that can help protect her and strengthen her against all of the BS that people like to throw.   tl;dr: Give constant reassurance and validation; and encourage internal self-exploration so that she can find and utilize those special places in her psyche that will protect and provide for her.

I believe INFP s can be divided into these two types (I'm the Monk type). As for T, I believe it gets stronger with age in INFP's. Also, and I'm not judging, I smoked ""herb"" too, but I'm just concerned you're self medicating. You see all the confessions on here, being in touch with your humanity includes recognizing all your faults, but you said 0% pathology. That just hints at a little denial to me.

I don't believe I'm in denial more than the normal blindspots we all possess. I constantly examine my life and my perspective, and I'm open to insights including yours.   I appreciate your concern but I think you were taking my 0% rather literally.  I've got problems (who doesn't) but I'm not dangerous because I'm conservative in my actions, and a compassionate and furvent pacifist.   Yes I'm self-medicating, on this we can agree. What's particularly wrong with that? Herb (cannabis) is an easily available, relatively safe, inexpensive/free and now legal alternative to prescription meds which many people still abuse. It doesn't provide all the answers but neither do prescription meds (I've never had any). And makes me feel good throughout the day. I have a load of responsibilities and lead a good life. There are times when i don't smoke, but at this point I'm at peace with it."
infp,3dqdrv,googajub,12,Sun Jul 19 04:27:33 2015 UTC,"Ugh this resonates with me so much. In highschool I was considered super weird and everyone called me weird. One kid decided to do it in class to the point where I cried and left class. I had a few really close friends who got my weirdness and when they saw I was upset they went and found the kid who upset me and yelled at him and stuff. I never truly appreciated having friends until that moment.   I don't know what my advice would be. Teenagers are terrible. Just let her know that being weird isn't a bad thing and that highschool is just a horrible place, and that people with the attitudes that her bullies have don't get far in life. College/university is sooooo much better (if you go for what you really enjoy... because chances are you will meet people who enjoy the same thing and get you).   I'm so sorry that this happened to your daughter. Especially since I know exactly what it feels like. Those kids are pathetic and need to get a life. :("
infp,3dqdrv,mayplo,12,Sat Jul 18 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"I got called weird all the time, but it was never like a bullying thing. I think what it really comes down to, (and what it came down to for me) is if she takes the labels they give her and runs with it...runs with the weird and the strange, it takes away the power from them and puts it back it her hands. Make weird her thing, her word, and it's not a weapon anymore."
infp,3dqdrv,seaweedmustache,8,Sat Jul 18 15:31:21 2015 UTC,I dont think I've ever been directly called weird persay but honestly I was teased and bullied quite a bit in school. Not the worst but I had my share.  When I started playing tennis when I was little the racquet could really tear up my hand from trying to grip it a certain way to perform certain actions and what not.  Overtime I got very good callouses that helped me not get blisters and what not every time I played. I wouldnt know how to give my kid the mental callouses they needed but it seems like they need to make a shield of their own imagination.  I had a lot of teasing over having white hair (started at age 11-12). Mostly from girls at that. Being a boy I didnt really know how to deal with it.  INFP kids are easy targets. They sense the sensitivity in us and pick at it like a kid picks at a scab on their arm to see it bleed. They know right away that we dont fit into there very limited boxes. Some seem to get a power trip from being mean to us. Others are afraid of being the next in line for that bad treatment or fear the loss of popularity from dissociation from the bullying/ not joining in.  Only the real strong individualistic popular people may not engage in that behavior but mostly I only saw that sort of person in high school and not so much in elementary/middle school.  Mona from Pretty Little Liars definitely comes to mind when you mentioned what those girls said to your daughter. I wish I could say ignoring would do something but its hard to instill a blatant IDGAF mentality into a child yet in a healthy stand your ground against bullshit sort of way.
infp,3dqdrv,ChimeraCheree,6,Sat Jul 18 13:37:04 2015 UTC,"How old is your daughter? I definitely went through the same thing, and 12-14 was by far the worst stretch of it. That age is tough for just about everyone, though, and I think the uniqueness of INFPs doesn't make it any easier. Eventually, I learned to love the qualities that set myself apart from others, and once I stopped trying so hard to fit in - later I realized, trying so hard to become an ESFJ, essentially - I became so, so much happier. I'll always be weird. I follow some social norms as they suit me, but I've learned there's nothing to be gained by wishing I was 'normal.' Very hard to understand that when you're younger, but it's really great that she has a tight group of friends that accept her for who she is. That's a huge help, and I hope she can hold onto and appreciate that."

infp,3dqdrv,tigerscomeatnight,7,Sat Jul 18 19:22:12 2015 UTC,"At some point, they were stood behind her and they kept messing with her hair and going: ""Ewwwww."" :(   This defines how I was treated in about 90% of middle school, I only ever really had one friend in each school (I went to three different ones, due to moving). They all treated me the same way, regardless of school. It was a little better in the third one, since I was only there for 7th and 8th grade and people didn't know me that well, but the first two were relentless. Any chance there was to tease me, it was taken. I had to keep my distance from people, because if I didn't, they would pretend to touch me and say ""ewww"" as if I was diseased, or if I came up to a group of girls playing a group game, they would all stop, get up, and walk away. It was awful, and I can understand how she is feeling.  What I learned from this is that I never want anyone to feel the same way that I did, in any way, shape, or form. Tell her that they are showing her how not to be. Let her know that her compassion for others can shine brighter, because she knows what it's like to be hurt. The harder lesson is that they should be loved anyway, as they are young themselves, and they don't realize how much it really hurts, nor do they put themselves in the other's shoes to see how it would feel to them. So, tell her that she is beautiful, and that she can help others feel beautiful, too, by loving them and not doing what the other kids want to do.  TL;DR: She is beautiful, they can't comprehend what they are doing because they aren't putting themselves in her shoes. She knows the pain of what people can do- so now she also can know to never want that for anyone else."
infp,3dqdrv,SapphireRyu,5,Sat Jul 18 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, i was called weird and i was bullied and left out a lot. Granted i was a bit socially awkward too.. but anyway, when I started high school it got a lot better. There I found friends who were more like me and more accepting of me being a bit different. And also about the empathic part, maybe you should look up hsp aswell. I am hsp and i think that was a contributinh factor to why i didn't feel lile everyone else in school. But hsp is really a good thing i think. If you just come to terms with it it's pretty great!"
infp,3dqdrv,Unicornsparkledust,4,Sat Jul 18 14:18:31 2015 UTC,"It was like this for me throughout school (I'm male though), there was a specific group of kids in a higher grade that would single me out with insults and criticisms and make 'jokes' at my expense. Of course I absolutely hated it, but most of those kids did not mean any harm when they say these kind of things they just don't know better and are usually under peer pressure. It's often the case that they are trying to make you 'fit in' with them because they are very sensitive to how they appear as a social group, they don't want to associate with people that they feel reflect poorly on them.   It is very immature and kids grow out of it towards the end of highschool. I'm not sure what you can really do about it, I think it is just a part of growing up. My advice would be to not to get overly emotional or dramatic about the insults because that's like blood in the water to them."

I was always really good at sports, had good grades, am fairly good looking (I think), and still could associate with the gaming/nerdy crowd, too. I never really felt like I fit in, but I was never left feeling left out per se. I was never bullied in school. I just tended to keep to myself and avoided most social situations. I never went to a party in high school or even prom. I forced myself out of that in college and everything has improved socially since, but I'd imagine if I shared my thoughts people would think I'm weird."

infp,3dqdrv,Flower-Hour,3,Sat Jul 18 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"Kids are cruel. A lot of them haven't truly learned yet why being mean is wrong. Yeah, I was a ""weird"" kid too, and I got a lot off bullying and a lot of people isolating me throughout most of my childhood and teens. But I also made some really close and amazing friendships that I don't think would be as valuable and tightly knit otherwise.   The best thing I can suggest is just to support her and do your best to make sure she knows she's not anything that those kids say she is.   I had gum stuck in my hair, I had things thrown at me. I had kids come up and tease me like they'd been planning it all day. My birthday parties were small and disappointing no matter how many people I tried to invite. I even went threw a few different groups of ""friends"" who I thought were true but weren't. My best friends even started a little drama with me here and there as we got older and more hormone riddled, ha. I wasn't the weirdest kid at school, but I certainly wasn't high on the food chain. There were a couple times I'm not proud to say that I turned and teased people who were ""less cool"" than me to ensure that I at least stayed above them and didn't sink lower. I shouldn't have, and I regret it. Those kids never would have magically gotten ""cooler"" in the eyes of the normal kids, I was just insecure.   Everything started to change in I want to say junior high, though. The kids around me were finally learning and understanding why being hurtful is wrong. Not just ""it's bad don't do it"", but actually understanding. I feel like people take a lot longer to truly develop a sense of empathy than we think, in most cases, and it's types like us that develop it maybe even too soon, survival-wise. It sucks. But eventually the peers catch up and start realizing that we're all different and weird and we should all stop acting like that's the worst thing in the world to be. Because really, they were all just desperately trying to play the part of the least weird, the least different, at least in accordance to their clique standards."
infp,3dqdrv,lurrz,3,Sat Jul 18 17:28:46 2015 UTC,"At pick-up, I could tell she was kinda down and upset so I asked her about it and she said that two girls from her group were really mean to her. Things they said: ""What's up with your hair? Did you even take a shower this week?!"" (She has naturally curly hair.) ""You're really weird, like, mentally-ill psycho!"" ""The boys in our group think you're ugly."" At some point, they were stood behind her and they kept messing with her hair and going: ""Ewwwww."" :(   Oh man, this really hit home for me. I had the curliest of hair, and I was relentlessly teased for it. Kids are horrible to each other, and they don't really grow out of it for a while (and some don't grow out of that behavior at all). It's hard, really hard to not take that sort of thing to heart, especially as an INFP, and it takes years to reverse that kind of thinking. It can be really hard to learn to stand up for yourself, especially for things you cannot always help (curly hair is a stubborn mule).  Reading this is heavy on memories for me, since my mom ended up standing up for me a lot, because I got teased at the bus stop for various things, and she caught on that I was being bullied and ended telling them to knock it off. I think that made things better, but I ended up withdrawing further into my shell afterward anyway, because I didn't want to cause trouble.  The one thing I wish I got told as a kid was that I am normal. Normal for being kind, creative, selfless, idealistic, and optimistic. Our world is full of cynical assholes who love trodding down those among them who don't fit in. A mass of peacocks strutting around lose their luster if they're all the same, and the subtle peahen gets lost in the crowd.  Those who would try to keep her down are in the wrong, she should embrace that weirdness with open arms and embrace those who are equally weird, even if they're a little scared to admit it to others. Weirdness keeps the world interesting, even the horrible crapholes that are middle and high school. Thankfully, it does get better toward the end of high school and into college, because middle-school pettiness eventually gets less important.  Not sure how much this will help you and her, but you're a great mom for looking toward other INFPs to help yourself better understand her. Remember to encourage and challenge her, because encouragement without a challenge is hardly encouragement at all."
infp,3dqdrv,aminim00se,3,Sat Jul 18 18:52:57 2015 UTC,"Geniuses are often called weird. Maybe your daughter is a budding revolutionary.   She needs approval, trust and encouragement more than anything else. You may have to accept that you don't understand everything she does."
infp,3dqdrv,googajub,3,Sat Jul 18 19:13:14 2015 UTC,"I was always the weird one and awkward one in the group, but I always found a place. Even when I was depressed, I had a small circle of people.  Until recently I chose isolation, but I've come to learn that going out and having fun with friends is the best thing ever. So push her towards building bonds with her close friends. Encourage it and try to give her plenty of chances to be with those she treasures.  As for high school, I have black curly hair down to my shoulderblades and people knew me for my hair being so long. At first people were always telling me to straighten it and I felt like I should and had to, but by senior year I'd grown up a lot. By senior year I had a much more defined personality: people knew my name even when I didn't know them because I was the one who drove a SmartCar, became the editor of the school newspaper (just to later quit it and spout endlessly how I disagreed with how it ran/where its priorities lied), and had the curly dark hair.   Simply put, allow her to embrace her feelings. Not allowing an INFP to embrace their feelings is awful to them. I struggle daily to be completely genuine, but I will get there one day.  Edit: I forgot to mention that people did give me quite a hard time ocassionally about my looks, the way I acted, and how I wished to dress/present myself. Bullying-wise, it wasn't really physical, but I did feel unwelcome a lot of the time. That is, until I gave up my facades."
infp,3dqdrv,Lynac,3,Sat Jul 18 19:44:59 2015 UTC,"Huh I'm really not sure.  I wasn't really concerned with popularity or anything, and my group of friends adored me (and I was pretty decent at talking to new people and making friends).  I'm sure plenty of people disliked me, but I never experienced anything like that!  It really sounds like she's been picked as the easy target (infps are usually kind of idiosyncratic and susceptible to meanness). I really think you should treat it as a case of bullying, and maybe figure it out together."
infp,3dqdrv,aint_it_strange,3,Sat Jul 18 19:58:03 2015 UTC,Had the exact same thing all the way through school. So I had 2-3 Good friends (2 who are today my best friends)  and just got through it.  Around 5th or 6th grade or so I started to be a bit more accepted. Kinda got the role of the weird funny guy. Many girls stayed venomous towards me though.  I just ignored them. Just do your best to support her and assure her things get a lot better as she grows up.  Children can be brutal. Not much you can do about that.
infp,3dqdrv,Rich0664,3,Sat Jul 18 20:13:31 2015 UTC,I got teased a lot harder a lot earlier so by the middle of high school I had completely stopped paying attention to it at all.   The best thing to do is not just ignore them which is a good first step but to be a really happy person in general and become even happier when you get teased. Besides being happy (which is pretty much the best thing ever regardless) it throws a wrench in a teasing narrative that is in the teasers head and they will often (after a time of getting worse to see if you are serious) find someone more entertaining to pick on.
infp,3dqdrv,macjoven,3,Sat Jul 18 20:59:56 2015 UTC,"I'm a 17 year old INFP, and that second paragraph describes me exactly.  INFPs are often said to be misunderstood, and I think that's true. I often have issues trying to convey my ideas and viewpoints, and my sense of humor is hard for some people to get or makes people uncomfortable. I don't know how old your daughter is, but she's just gotta embrace her quirkiness. I struggle with it, mostly due to depression, but I feel like I've gotten used to being seen as ""out there.""

infp,3dqdrv,happilyemployed,3,Sat Jul 18 22:15:22 2015 UTC,"I was considered weird, yeah. It was a hard pill to swallow, but I still made lasting friends. The philosophy of ""fewer, better"" friends got me through grade and high school, but not unharmed. I developed with some psychological trauma brought about by rejection and watching some of my close friends tear their lives apart with drug abuse.  But as I grew older, being an INFP became drastically more useful. I began to develop a profound love of fantasy and science fiction themes and was able to make many great friends who shared these loves with me.  Now I consider myself to be living a blessed life beyond what many people can hope for because of the ease with which I am able to make friends and experience healthy inspired highs that don't rely on drug use.  I guess my main advice was that, your fledgling INFP child needs a foundation of love. Always be there, always do your very best to be understanding and caring. Never give your child even a moment's doubt about whether she is really loved by you or not, and then watch her blossom."

I wished I was ""normal"" when I was a kid, but I love and embrace who I am now.  Part of it for your daughter is that the ""mean girls"" have likely identified her as an easy target. I think kids are meaner now than when I was in school (I remember No Rain by Blind Melon, so I totally get the Bee People, and I love that analogy!)  I found my Bee People in high school (about grade 11ish), and as I got older things  got better. I think childhood can be hard on INFP kids, especially ones like your daughter. Unfortunately the only advice I have is ""it gets better"". But it truly does.   Edit: I always wanted curly hair since I was a kid, so I envy what she has :)"
infp,3dqdrv,toast79,3,Sat Jul 18 22:59:41 2015 UTC,"I'm old enough to remember the Blind Melon video, and I LOVE that song. What I was going to say in my comment pretty much reflects the imagery in the video too.      I can really relate to what your daughter is going through (female INFP here) and junior high (around ages 11 to 13) was by far the worst. I think that's a tough age for everyone, and worse when you're sensitive emotionally and don't feel like you ""fit in"" anywhere. I've always been a bit of a tomboy and never had trouble playing sports with the boys. But the girls were soooooooooo mean.      In high school, I found my niche in the music department and just kind of hid there until I graduated. That was my ""bee colony"" group, like in the Blind Melon video.     The only advice I can give is for her to practice acting like she doesn't care in front of the bullies. Sometimes bullies act that way because putting others down makes them feel better about themselves. Sometimes it's because they like to get a reaction. I used to just shrug and act like I didn't give a shit, which did get people to leave me alone sometimes.     Like in That 70's Show when Hyde teaches Jackie how to ""be cool"" by ignoring Laurie's insults.     Then at home, let her pour out her heart to you and be supportive (which it sounds like you already do). And encourage her to keep doing what she loves, whether it be music or something else. Honing those skills will give her more confidence in herself.      Good luck to you and your girl!"

I liked building with Lego's, reading books, playing video games, and tv.  My peers were always more interested in sports and getting in trouble (no, really).  I was bullied, and i cried a lot.  I had trouble talking with people in general, very shy.  Kids were mean, and it was a reality I just accepted.  So, I was ""weird"".  I had very supportive parents and older siblings and they allowed me to be who I was.  I also had a couple close friends that I am still friends with today more than 25 years later.  Things are much better for me now.  I am better adjusted emotionally, but I still get a little cantankerous when someone is mean for what I see as no reason.  I have a successful career as a software developer, I have many friends, and I have a girlfriend who is an ENTJ.  She loves and hates how I can pick out her current emotions by just looking at her.    You sound like a supportive parent.  Just keep being there for her and it should work out just fine =)"

It's been a complete 360 change of personality -- people are drawn toward me now, instead of away from me. And because of that, I've built up a lot of confidence in myself, which really reinforces people's interest in me. I've learned that the key is to be happy, confident in yourself, and interested in others. If you are those three things, you can be weird as hell and nobody cares -- people like it, in fact, because they like you. I know it is infinitely easier said than done, but I can't stress how true it is. I'd encourage you to put your daughter in situations where she is celebrated for herself rather than judged. As a kid, I found myself accepted at writing camps, art camps, etc. -- even programming camps, where all the nerds were. ;) And college especially is a wonderful place, because everyone is so intellectually minded and interested in novelty and depth. My friends joke that I could charm anyone I wanted with my natural personality, and I've had a few people try to mimic my quirks -- presumably because they see them as part of an identity they'd like to have. For this reason, I can safely say that your daughter's own idea of her value can very easily be influenced by the environment that she's in, and so I'd encourage you to look for ways that you can expose her to safe and equally 'weird' environments. Once there, she will be a shining star compared to all the other kids back home. I hope this helps you somewhat!"
infp,3dqdrv,Schlitterschuh,2,Sun Jul 19 16:35:05 2015 UTC,"One word answer - Yes.  Junior high and high school were something to get through to move on in life, and I was glad to leave it behind.  I have a pre-teen boy, and I'm starting to see some of the same things.  It doesn't help that he has Asperger's, so he's not even picking up on it.  I have to do a bit of the ""those kids you think are your friends are not really"".  It will help her a lot that she has a parent that understands and accepts her.  I just returned from a family vacation, where I played the game of ""how many days until I think ""maybe I was adopted, that would explain the differences"""", and it's really depressing."
infp,3dqdrv,GoingToPlanB,2,Sun Jul 19 19:48:04 2015 UTC,I was actually popular. I was kind and friendly and personable to everyone.

infp,3dqdrv,Shanman150,2,Mon Jul 20 22:55:06 2015 UTC,"I was certainly weird in grade school.  Thinking back, I had 2 close friends who were just as weird as I was, and for much of school we were partly outcasts in our class of 20.  It didn't matter too much to me, given that my ""best-friends-in-the-whole-wide-world"" were there by my side.  High school was a bit tricky, I was still a weird kid and this time I had to make new friends.  But by senior year, I had people who would stand up to the couple of odd folks who insisted on being rude to me, and that meant a thousand times more to me than the fact that some people in our school didn't get it.  In college I finally settled into being a little more normal.  I still consider myself ""whimsical"", and I love that word.  I do things normal college kids do, but then I also try to drag friends off on ""adventures"" at any opportunity, and still wander around with my head in the clouds.  It gets better, and it's definitely helpful to have friends there with you.  Weird kids can make friends - they just make weird friends!  And that's 100% fine.  So long as she has a sense of ""I'm my own person, and I'm valuable"", I think she'll get along well."

I couldn't fit in with them no matter how hard I tried. They seemed to be the ones that would end up throwing stuff at me or the nerdy kids in class and all that yuk yuk. I experienced a lot of anxiety in a lot of my classes but what got me through was having my own tight group just like the one your daughter has. They made me feel wanted and relevant and we did all kinds of things :)  It's awful that those kids are saying that to your daughter though. Some children can be sooo nasty. When I was in primary school I had a lot of people being pretty awful to me, however the effects of that wore off through highschool and now that I'm graduated well I couldn't care less.

When it comes to making decisions, I understand what's efficient and what my colleagues would do, but I weigh the decision on how it's going to affect others as well. For example: In a discussion of whether or not to leave trash in the woods, or to pack it out, some don't care, some people bring up the effect it could have on the ecology of the forest, whereas I immediately brought up how a landowner would feel if there were trash on his land.

infp,3dqxvt,Rad_q-a-v_,3,Sat Jul 18 17:24:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not big into logic, stats, or clear cut ""facts"". I simply find them boring and uninteresting. And just because I (or us, as INFP's) don't usually like dealing with concrete situations such as graphs or other mathematical tools doesn't mean we're stupid by any means. It just means we are really good at other things; namely abstract and introspective thinking.  We absolutely excel in fields like social sciences and humanities. Because of our deep introspection we often get hold of complex philosophy and critical theory way faster than the vast majority of people. And we often actually like these dense texts. A whole lot of the biggest names in philosophy are INFPs: Soren Kierkegaard, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Albert Camus, etc.. And all of the other big names seem to be ENFPs (such as Mark Twain and Jacques Derrida)  I can sit down with A Thousand Plateaus (one of the most intense theory/philosophy texts written) and my friend can sit beside me and do hardcore calculus like it's no problem; both of us are equally dumbfounded by what the other person is able to do. I extrapolate and make connections about the world with very complex thought experiments, while my friend can break things down into objective symbols and signs (math and science stuff).   Of the flipside of your TL;DR I get super annoyed by T's not being able to get into anything that is remotely abstract or philosophical while they are super annoyed by me blatantly not caring about stats and other concrete/external figures. It's all about who is good at what and how those things are different (but can still help each other).   Science and math needs philosophers to sort out all kinds of fascinating problems that scientists and mathematicians simply aren't able to do (well).      ""A man of Science is a poor philosopher"" - Albert Einstein    tl;dr It's not that INFPs are dumb, it's that we think in a much different (and wonderful) way."

We love musing on different ideas, but tend to accept the ones that seem the most promising and true.    Intjs, however, seem to be a type that people give weight to in logical discussions.  Intjs judge outwardly and base their perceptions off of their judgements.  When musing, they tend to accept the ideas that are most thrilling or exciting to them, not the ones that necessarily seem to be the most true.

infp,3dplzn,KthuluKat,2,Sat Jul 18 05:41:16 2015 UTC,"First off, let me say I could have written this myself... really similar ex experience.   I hope explaining my view a little bit is relatable for you.  It's really troublesome to hear you feel shame for how you feel. Two important things I keep in mind:   1.) You can't really control how you feel. (attaching shame to this is really negative since you can't do much but suffer for it)  2.) The one dishing out the shame is none other than yourself.   Feelings certainly tell a truth, but not the whole truth. You feel regret? Not good enough? Weak? Don't reject these, explore them. Why? How?   These feelings are like a raw input signal, but you as a person have the tools to redirect/reexamine/reinterpret that raw signal into something else.  A big discovery that helped me and my mental framework is that I'm at a loss when controlling how I feel, but with enough mental discipline I can usually control my actions so things end up in a good place.   A small example: Recently I wanted to hang out with a good friend of mine, but he didn't call me back. He'd never done that before. I got kind of upset, and then the ridiculous train of thought arrived. ""Well he's probably needs a break from me, I can be so overbearing. He just doesn't know how to tell me. If I didn't wear my heart on my sleeve so much, I wouldn't be so exhausting, and this wouldn't happen.""   So, yeah, I worry about coming off too strong, but that's who I am. I can't change that. My options here are to feel sorry for myself/punish myself and push myself away, or stop and examine why I feel that way, and what I really want. I brought it up with him a few days later, and in this case he was just honestly busy, so, any negativity there was all on me, you know?  I have some more to say on that but I just want to stop my rambling and make sure we're on the same page first, haha. If you agree/disagree I want to hear where you're at."
infp,3dplzn,TelevisionSky,2,Sat Jul 18 07:19:30 2015 UTC,I agree. The shame is really attached to the feeling that I can’t do anything positive about them. I get overwhelmed very easily and all I have the energy to do while riding it out is brood over it. I don’t think clearly in these moods and the thoughts I have are extremely negative towards myself and others. I’ve caught myself in this cycle of helplessness that I don’t know how to get out of without feeling dangerously vulnerable.
infp,3dplzn,TelevisionSky,2,Sat Jul 18 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"Hm, to further illustrate something, I'll bring you back to my example:   Well he's probably needs a break from me, I can be so overbearing. He just doesn't know how to tell me. If I didn't wear my heart on my sleeve so much, I wouldn't be so exhausting, and this wouldn't happen.""    I'm sure thoughts you have are along these lines, no? My example is a pretty tame one, I know, but it's similar?   It's astoundingly easy to get stuck in a kind of 'mental feedback loop' where you can't really see outside of a problem, and you keep returning to misleading conclusions that lead from it. ""I hate feeling like I'm so overbearing I pressure people close to me, but bringing it up would make that even worse, but I can't hold it in..."" this is a loop I find myself in kind of often, and in this example, there's no right answer. I have a negative feeling and a negative reaction, it's a kind of a closed loop. If I close myself off more, I feel bad. If I open up more, I'm afraid of taking the risk, and it would likely lead to myself feeling bad, and it will come up again... Etc.  So here I take a step back, deeply examine why I feel that way, why I feel that way in this moment, why I've been led to react this way from awful things in the past. This provides me with a context. Okay, so I have and understand the context, this lets me put it in a box, so it's slightly more managable. I don't feel this way because 'I'm weak', I feel this way because I feel slighted by my friend, and I have a long history of worrying about how I come off to others in the past. That being understood, what do I really want? How would I like to proceed from here, realistically? Even if it goes against my instincts, I follow that path, based on my framework.   Sometimes, I find out it's all in my head. Other times, I find out it's just a really messed up situation from all angles and the only thing I can really do is try my best to play damage control and minimize my worsening of the problem. This comes in two parts: Behavior towards myself, and towards others. This includes stuff like lashing out, being passive-aggressive, the cold shoulder, etc (others), and shelling up/guilt/shame (myself).  TL;DR Be as easy and accepting of you can with yourself. Your mind doesn't tell the whole truth, and no matter how insightful you are, you can only see one side of things, so, knowing that, do the best you can with that side you do see.  I really hope I've helped a little bit. A lot of this advice gets thrown out the window when it is a really rough or truly overwhelming situation, in which case I'm not a trained expert to help there, so, YMMV."

infp,3dplzn,elementary_vision,2,Sat Jul 18 23:56:35 2015 UTC,"I know that feeling of shame all too well. I will tell you this, no amount of analyzing or trying to understand the shame helped me. What did help was just sitting with those feelings and accepting them, without feeling the need to hide them or feel bad for them. Feeling ashamed of feelings is hell because as humans we are built to feel.   Here's something that really helps me. Instead of labeling the feeling like sad or angry or depressed or whatever, just tune in to the actual feeling in your body. Notice where it starts then expand your awareness and see if you can feel it in any other part of your body. Emotions are like an energy in the body, they just have to flow without the interference from the critical mind.   It's funny but for me despite the stereotype of INFPs being these irrational  emotionally driven volatile individuals, I've found that I'm the exact opposite. I'm very restrained emotionally, distrusting of my own feelings and intution, and completely stuck up in my head. Which means I have to practice the exact opposite which is less thinking, more feeling, and getting comfortable with having emotions.   I could theorize where all this came from till I'm blue in the face, but the fact is it doesn't matter. As long as I change the behavior or mindset I'm good. I'd read tons of books, looking for the answer or guidance. In the end it's already inside of you. No amount of reading or analyzing can teach you how to be at peace with your emotions because it's damn near impossible to describe how to do that. One of my biggest sticking points was the fact that I'd rely on books and other stuff to teach me to navigate my own emotional landscape, but they can only go so far. I was afraid to do it on my own because I held the belief I wasn't even capable.  I think INFPs can be very resilient and strong emotionally. But if you didn't have your emotional needs met at some point, emotions become an enemy because they are labeled as ""bad"" in your mind. So what causes the largest emotional distress is the internal battle going on to resist engaging in a very natural thing that all humans do. I think INFPs who experience this need to peel back the layers of social conditioning until they return to a point where they are allowed to feel their emotions fully and as a result gain more control over them. Despite Fi being our dominant function, I have a feeling that some INFPs that go through particularly invalidating experiences end up being emotionally constricted.  tl;dr Someone taught you your emotions don't matter. They do. Feel them fully and accept them as a part of the human experience. They don't make you weak or wrong. Emotions are like the very blood that pumps through your veins. They just are. When you can accept that, the resistance to them will fade and you will feel better."
infp,3dplzn,mimigrape,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:54:01 2015 UTC,Thank you for your advice! The part about not having emotional needs met rings true for me. What you describes sounds like meditation; that's  helped me in the past but I haven't tried doing it in the heat of emotion.
infp,3dplzn,thundermanbearpig,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:05:12 2015 UTC,No problem. In the heat of emotion is the most valuable time to do it in my opinion. I was never too good with meditation because I'd always fall asleep or wander with my mind. But taking a more active approach really helped me understand the subtleties of emotions within my body and learn not to feel shame for them.
infp,3dnval,dontmindmeohno,17,Fri Jul 17 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"Reddit has an odd mixture of people, the loudest groups being some of the most detrimental imho. Different women like different things, and a hefty portion of the advice about things concerning men comes from redpillers or MRAs and such. A lot of women on twox and askwomen aren't necessarily feminist, but are still women and therefor experience the same things as feminist women do. Basically, we all have different likes and dislikes. If you are yourself around people, you will attract people who like you for what you are. There's no need to fake anything, that's unsustainable anyway.   Men get just as many mixed signals from society as women do. You have to look a certain way, act a certain way etc, but not too much because then you look like a douche/slut. It's nonsense and a marketing ploy that unfortunately many of us have fallen into and let shape our lives. Don't exhaust yourself with this crap, it's not worth it and it never ends well.  You know what men are supposed to be? Decent human beings. Same goes for women. Anything other than that is all superficial and ever-changing.

I don't like that dynamic. Some people do though. And sure, you can get some advice from people about how to be more attractive to women or whatever, but at the end of the day, she has to truly like you for you. And some will.

Someone who is quality will be attracted to someone who is kind and gentle, caring, and loving.   C: Reread A and B.   Seriously. I had a lot of issues in my formative years with masculinity. Still do in a lot of ways. I was always lanky, gentle, frustrated by the ""Manly"" things that men around me wanted me to do. Sports? That sounds suspiciously lame. Fishing? Sounds like doing nothing. I'd much rather read a book and engage in games of my own choosing, than watch others do some activity. No, I didn't really want to talk about girls, not in the way other guys wanted. As a matter of fact, I always got along with women best, likely because they weren't part of ""Guy culture."" I could express my love of music and reading, and learning about lots of different things, without being put down. A lot of girls either assumed I was just a friend and not interested, or were not interested because I wasn't what they wanted. That's fine, everyone is entitled to have their own taste in partners.   I stumbled onto my wife through a friend of a friend, and it was great. She loves me because I care, because I'm gentile hearted and idealistic, and as she's an ISTJ, we really do have compatible types that supplement each other.   So... Don't be afraid of who you are. Be you. Do your thing. Quality people will be attracted to that. Do your best to surround yourself with quality people, and eventually their quality friends will interact with you, and so on. You'll find what you're looking for, and that tends to happen when you're not looking, and just being yourself. So don't worry."
infp,3dnval,Theopholus,3,Fri Jul 17 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"Okay first, I totally get where you're coming from; personally I have to stay away from most threads remotely related to gender on Reddit cause they squick me out so much.   The best thing you could do, I think, is to just keep on doing you. It's advice that gets shat on a lot, but if you can do it, and do it confidently, you're golden. Honestly, as a girl who is attracted to guys, there is nothing more attractive than someone who is gentle and kind, and doesn't try to hide it. Conversely, if I ever found out a guy thought that he should ""lead but not control"" me, I would both think he was an ass and want to run away as far as earthly possible.  On the other hand, like you said, there are women that are into that sort of thing, and there's nothing wrong with that. You seem to think that this is some vast majority of women. I disagree. Firstly, I think you need to separate it into women who are into being controlled in the bedroom and those who want to be ""lead"" in their daily lives. The latter are pretty rare, I think. As to the former, there are plenty of people, men and women, who are into being dominated sexually. I have a friend who worries that this makes her ""unfeminist"", but really, it's just a sexual preference, and you just aren't compatible with these people. There are also plenty of people out there who don't like it, so don't worry.  TLDR? You'll be fine. Don't try to force yourself to be something you're not."

But it is up to you to find it, to go out there and connect with other people. Just be you and don't worry to much about what others think. Everyone is merely the center of their own little worlds, so in the end they won't think much of you unless they find you interesting. From there it should go naturally, if you have to act or force to much (control or lead whatever) then I would say it isn't a happy relation. Love is in the little things that you do for someone else without a 'real' reason other than making someone else his/her live a little bit brighter.

You want to lead, but not control   That will get you absolutely nowhere with some women, so apparently they don't all fit that stereotype.  How about you lead if it's something you're passionate about, and I'll lead when it's something I'm passionate about (paraphrasing here).   Everytime I read one of those threads I think ""These are the very much feminist women of reddit. Just imagine the expectations normal women in real life will have   Yeah, I wouldn't put too much stock in the ""very much feminist"" part, just because you call yourself one doesn't make you one.  I'm sure some of them are, and some are sexist as hell, and some are this -ist, and some are that -ist. For the second part of the sentence above, I think most women are feminists, they just don't necessarily fly the flag (make a lot of noise about it).

When the romance is aimed at a guys, the girl takes the lead, the girl drops all of the hints, the girl asserts herself and gets jealous about other girls.  People are drawn to confidence. Being INFP does not bar you from being confident, in fact it can do the exact opposite if you really believe it. You are who you wish to be. If you truly want to appeal to women, you can learn to project yourself and become the 'manly' guy of their dreams, and that can be the real you, you just need to put in the energy.

Really, the only manly things about me aren't things that happen all that often or are things that happened before, but not now: played contact sports in high school, I enjoy shooting guns but don't have the money for bullets, enjoy paintball but don't have money for markers/paintballs and don't have enough friends to play with, I enjoy doing manual labor if I can overcome my laziness, I have a high pain tolerance, and I like taking things apart to see how they work.    Your biggest asset in finding a woman for yourself is one of the traits I mentioned that I DON'T have, and that's self-confidence.  If you're confident that you're worth dating and project that when asking a woman out, she'll pick up on that. If you're not confident about it, well... if you don't think you're worth it, why should she?  Also, sensitivity to the feminine side of people allows you to interact with a woman on an emotional level much easier than Buffy the Leg-day Slayer, which you can work to your advantage."

I think your comment about ""feminists wanting to be thrown around in bed... what are other women like..probably more so"" is a little bit in your head. Sure a girl likes to be dominated once in a while. That doesn't mean that all women want that all the time. I've been sleeping around a bit lately and tbh.... I just want butterflies and to explore someone and for them to explore me. And for a guy to not fuck off once he gets what he wants. Besides... you don't have to be super manly to attract women... but super manly guys attract a lot of women... and a lot of women who probably aren't the best for him. A lot of women who he's going to have to sort through to find who he really wants to be with. Don't be so down on yourself about this.   Manliness tends to be overrated. Just be yourself... and don't try to be someone else to attract a woman... because it will get you the wrong woman."

But then, I've got gender identity issues anyway so, in that way it makes sense and I'm okay with it. But yeah, for me, being a ""man"" sucks. I can't even use that word to describe myself, it describes something that isn't me.  In my last relationship, there was a running joke that our roles were reversed, that my gf was the man and I was the woman. She wore the pants a lot of the time, was generally more dominant and even wanted sex more often than me. That.. Turned out to be more than just a joke, in my case, but I digress.  I'm trying to do the whole ""man"" thing, or get as close to it as I can without feeling like I'm betraying myself, before I make any final decisions about transitioning or what have you, but it's just shitty. I feel like I'm not what 90 percent of women are looking for and never, ever will be.  The only comfort I can really gleen from it is that when I do find that person who wants me and loves me for what I am and not what I'll never be, that will be one hella awesome relationship where I can be myself without worrying about not fulfilling some bullshit stereotype. It's just.. Ugh, how long will it take to find that person? :-/"

Honestly I think it is a bigger deal for younger women but fuck it. I'm not going to change myself to fit in with some expected normative behavior. And sometimes you've got to mentally be prepared for the worse. I'll end up all alone because I don't want to play to people's expectations.

infp,3dnval,ChimeraCheree,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:47:37 2015 UTC,Look all I can say is that what a woman says can and will be at odds with how she behaves. You cant take everything they say at face value. Theres always subtext and social cues at work.  Just because a woman lays down very specific criteria does not mean that you cant change her mind into considering you potentially.  Anything that you can do to increase your self esteem should help you deal with those feelings of inadequacy. Real self love within yourself is the only way you'll like being yourself and find yourself attractive.
infp,3dnval,ChimeraCheree,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:03:14 2015 UTC,"I think there are woman on the other side of the fence that feel the same way or more importantly have the same dilemma.  I personally would say that women overall are attracted to stoicism. I think they respond positively if they feel like we can ""run"" things and maintain a positive stature and outlook (has to come from a good place and not just faked) when things go wrong. And things will go wrong even in the most ideal circumstances.   I remember on the Morning Show Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda were talking about men/women dynamic related stuff and basically Kathie's interpretation of the what the guest star said was that the ideal man was a Cave man that considered the woman's thoughts. Something to that effect.  I know what your saying about thinking that it would have been better to be born as a woman but look it like this though.  When your girlfriend/wife is being very feminine (in the way she acts) your doing a good job. A woman doesnt want to be burdened with being masculine around her man because it stifles her ability to be feminine around you. How she wants to be professionally is vastly different from what she wants to be like at home especially if shes a high powered career type.  You can be who you are. All men have some female traits. All women have some male traits. Its what makes us human. If a man can be a caretaker for a child and a woman can be a fire fighter it shows the amount of diversity we hold in our hands.  As long as you can foster a persona where you are self confident,  a decision maker, and emotionally healthy to a good extent I dont see why any woman wouldnt want you.  We all have this within us."

A woman doesnt want to be burdened with being masculine around her man because it stifles her ability to be feminine around you.   Ok. But I pretty much never act ""masculine"", so she'd have to be feminine while dealing with that.  I'm not a decision maker (at least not anymore than your average woman) and I definitely don't have it within me.  I mean, it's depressing but I wouldn't be willing to change just to become attractive. I'm how I am and I'll remain like this."
infp,3dnval,donnademuertos,-2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:22 2015 UTC,"I dont know how I can convey this to you properly. The most basic thing that a man gives to a woman is stability. This is what she wants instinctively. This does not come from wealth or being romantic or being caring (not to say that these things dont have their own value).  A woman wants to know that you can weather her storm. Give her stability. Make her feel safe. That is what I mean by being your masculine to her feminine.  That is what I'm trying to say. Women even the confident ones will always feel a certain level of uncertainty. For a woman to have enough certainty for both of you is unrealistic and if possible puts more strain on her.  Try going on vacation for a week with a woman and letting her lead. Always let her take the first step and figure out everything. Dont bother deciphering a planned route or the best way to get around. Let her decide everything. I dont think it will be a pretty thing.  I think when the word lead or leader is mentioned you feel like its an occupation and you dont have the skill for it. In a crisis not every group is going to have have a natural leader type there are going to be times when every person has to step up and be proactive. The walking dead shows that Glenn had to step up at times. Even a more solitary dude like Daryl had to step up too.  This isnt about going against your nature or trying to be something your not. Women taking on main leadership roles at a job or being the main bread winner for their family could be argued as not ""being who they are"". There condition was created by circumstance and they deal with it the best they can."

Dont bother deciphering a planned route or the best way to get around. Let her decide everything. I dont think it will be a pretty thing.   Nor would it be pretty if I were burdened with the responsibility to lead, something I'm just not wired for.  It would seem that you think women are pre-programmed to be lousy leaders, but I, being a male,  am somehow fit for the job, despite the fact that...well, that I'm not.  As for the rest, I can step up if there is no other option, but the situation you describe is an extreme. If I were burdened with the responsibility of protecting or making someone else feel safe the majority of the time, then that means that they are getting all the benefits out of the relationship, making it unfair. Being protected and made to feel safe is nice, but protecting and making someone feel safe is stressful. If I am in a relationship and all or most of what I feel is stress, then I'm going to end things sooner than later."

For example many people come in and everything hurts. When I first started I fixated on everything hurting to a degree where I was unable to help them because I did not want to bring more pain on them. At some point I got to see that I could help and that part of my job was being removed enough to let their pain be their pain. For you I think that you need to remember that their sadness is their sadness and it is not a bad thing. It is an emotion which they are going to have to go through and reassuring them that it's ok to be sad is perhaps more helpful than falling to pieces. You are doing a great service for people at a time in their lives when many others will not know what to do and I thank you for that.

We can learn from differences, so my advice to you would be to listen to him. If you do so, he will listen to you (but be patient!). INFPs are very sensitive souls, and all they really look for in relationships is acceptance. That they can freely share their thoughts and be weird as sh*t. That is what we do, we don't want to hate. All we want is love outside of us since it is such a war inside of us. If you can learn to accept and love him he will tone down, grow up normally and make rational decisions.   But it is up to you: choose to love (or try to) and be happy or choose dislike (and 'hate') and be unhappy. Whatever you choose or do, I support your decision.

Yes he still is an annoying 16 year old kid (I'm 21) but now we go to the cinema together, plady video games together, watch the same shows, go on bike rides etc but when it comes to beliefs on things we do differ so we don't talk about it and he's only 16 so he's still growing and some of those beliefs are changing. I feel like I've helped those beliefs change as well I feel.   Saying all that I still do don't get on with my older brother no matter how hard I try. He just ends up making feel like I'm small and pathetic. He tries to put me down at every corner to make him seem better than me. My mum told me she believes that he's jealous of me because I've always been able make friends easily and he doesn't so he takes it out on me to make him feel better about myself.

He also is incredibly submissive and accommodating when I'm trying to be competitive and difficult.  And finally he's always putting his guard down a being vulnerable when I'm trying to be mysterious and intellectual.  What is with this guy?  A few other difficulties I've noticed is that sometimes he just seems really unconfidant and nervous and really  struggling and even though I should probably be nice to him I can't control the fact that I just see a mortally wounded prey and really have to fight the urge to go in for the kill. It's like it's just the natural thing to do.  Also makes a lot of decisions based on his fee fees which is actually intriguing if it weren't for that there's practically no clear way to make him change his mind about anything since you don't know how heh go there and since he's also pretty resolute in his conclusions too it's hard not to write him off as lost and just resort to making fun of all his positions from then on instead since you realize you will literally never ""get to him"" save holding a gun to his head and tellin' him you're only going to say this once."

The idea that some words I type and put onto the internet can entertain and emotionally impact people was so bizarre and amazing to me.  Recently I've been leaning more towards music as a medium.

I practiced a song over and over, it was a folk song about a depressed man jumping off a bridge. I was two days until the open mic and I played it for a couple of guys after work and one of them listened with his head down pressed into his chest and then walked away quickly as soon as I finished. I made him cry. I caught up with him and we talked about a kid who had recently killed himself in our school. Then we hugged it out. Felt so validating and weird and empowering.

How do you produce so much?   I'm not sure... Usually I don't feel like I'm producing enough. A lot of it is about rabid commitment to finishing work even if it isn't the best thing I'll ever do.

If it's a lot of anger in a song it's usually sort of a energetic rock thing- although it's just me and an acoustic guitar. Anything else is sort of a jazzy folk if that makes sense.

I usually write one of two types: either trying to preserve an exact experience/moment in song, or trying to say something to someone that I can't say in real life. There are also story-songs, nonsense songs, ""idea"" songs (like that song your username references, for example. Sidebar: I'm a huge Radiohead fan), and probably lots more.  I'd say start with something that's really in your gut. Like the strongest feelings you have. Turn those feelings into images or ""dialogue"" and say them alongside a progression that makes you feel the same way. The melody will probably fall into place with the rhythm of the words."

It's sort of a way to express the feelings I am struggling with when I write it. I usually have a phrase or a symbol in my head for my emotions and I just flesh it out into an entire song length.

I'm a programmer so for me the creativity comes in how I write code and how I solve problems. But I don't consider myself very creative.
infp,3dnawo,JohannSebastianBlock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:09:38 2015 UTC,The end result of your programming can still be construed as being creative. Its just like in regular writing how the act of putting words onto a piece of paper isn't creative in itself but the story you get as an end product definitely is.

infp,3dn0qp,ChimeraCheree,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:04:41 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot of them, but my favorite is the Enneagram. I think MBTI takes second place, though.  You can also find out a bit more about your personality by reading both your Eastern and Western zodiac descriptions (not the horoscopes- only the description of the animal or constellation you are) and your blood type. You can also find your ""primal zodiac"" which is the personality of your east/west zodiacs combined, though your mileage may vary with that. A few other less accurate things are left/right handed personalities, left/right dominant brain personalities, the state or region you came from and common personalities, etc."

infp,3dkomo,elementary_vision,2,Fri Jul 17 18:16:40 2015 UTC,I've read up on it a bit. Lurked a few forums here and there. Noticed a lot of traits were similar between indigo and INFP. Definitely made me ponder things. I'm always open to stuff outside the realm of what's normal.
infp,3dkomo,rosa-_-sparks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:39:03 2015 UTC,"The allurement of the unknown might be an infp thing. I think we're existentialist in nature, we opt to seek our truth in an experimental fashion. Allowing our intuition to be the driving force in what we accept is what separates us from the rest. I don't think we typically function in the realm of what's normal. It's a beautiful yet isolating disposition. So similar to the indigo spirit, they're both like rebels with a bad case of the feels lol."

infp,3dkomo,rosa-_-sparks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:01:11 2015 UTC,"Trusting our instincts can be a highly spiritual task. We delve into our beings and utilize our souls as the ultimate compass. The reason why we feel so deeply is because we have this direct line to the divinity within.   We come into this world seeking truth, yet we find despair within a social construct that's not reflective of our spirit. That's when the acknowledgment of I'm different starts to hold grasp of our thought pattern. We ostracize ourselves before anyone else gets a chance to even form an opinion.   Over time self preservation starts to resemble self deprivation. We aren't fulfilled but we're ""safe"". We're aware of the depth of our own feelings, we know what our heart is capable of, but instead of allowing us to flourish we limit ourselves. How do we grow if we don't allow our emotions to blossom?   There is no comfort in conformity. Our essence and our motives are genuine. Leading a life of inauthenticity festers on our conscious and eats at our spirit. It's what makes us sick while attempting ""normalcy"".   I get it mister, same book, same page. (:"

I said that I thought the world could be extremely ugly for someone who had not learned to love himself, but that the world became beautiful to me as soon as I learned to love myself.       he said, ""The look in your eyes. That is power! The world is your oyster. Can you tell me why for someone like you, the world is your oyster, and yet for someone like me I am lost in a sea of madness?""       I thought about that for a bit, and I sighed and I said, ""I think I learned to love myself.

infp,3djs75,SnowAndInk,17,Thu Jul 16 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"I don't want children. I have big dreams, and the moment I have a child, I feel I'd have to concede those dreams to focus on the responsibility of raising it. To me, that would be like an early death; a total cessation of what I am and what I want to do, giving up and passing on all my hopes to someone else. Someone whose journey I'll only be a guest in.  I wouldn't know how to raise a child, either. For one thing, I'm too likely to fall to the temptation of being selfish, and neglecting it physically or emotionally. I have limited means, and I don't trust myself to put the right sacrifices into raising a child when I already voluntarily spend so much time away from my girlfriend.   Teaching the kid would be another thing I worry about. Even beyond the possibility of neglecting my son or daughter, I'm not one to be strict with people. My way of parenting would most likely leave my kid a spoiled, selfish brat. Like I'd be, if my father hadn't periodically screamed at me when I was young. And if I bite the bullet and lash out at my child in anger, I don't know if I could take the guilt of having carried that cycle on. For now, I hope that the worst of him can just die with me.  I don't want to have to make the choice between raising an unfettered rat or a timid mouse. I want to leave a mark on the world, as I feel most people do. But I'll try and do it through art."
infp,3djs75,ArabiaFats,2,Thu Jul 16 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"Man I didn't even think of the guilt of lashing out that makes it scarier. I got a corgi a few years back, as an INFP that is the worst dog choice ever, anyone else reading this stay the hell away it's literally like having a toddler. You have to teach it everything and when you finally get angry because it's not complying with it's teaching it remembers it forever! Then you feel like a fucking monster every time you look at it. I could only imagine how that would be if it was an actual child... shudders"
infp,3djs75,Eris_Grun,14,Fri Jul 17 22:49:29 2015 UTC,I do not want to ever have kids. If I were to ever be the guardian of a child then I would enjoy adopting one to call my own. Perhaps one who is already to an age where they would usually not be adopted (such as ages 5+).

infp,3djs75,Lum0s_Max1ma,8,Fri Jul 17 19:20:55 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I don't want children.  Part of it has to do with the current state of the world and my misanthropy. Yes things have gotten better in terms of sexism, racism, and homophobia, but they're still there. I'm reminded of it on reddit, the news, and it makes me sad.  I don't want to have to raise and teach a child that the world is an ugly and judgmental place.  Part of it is my depression and anxiety for 2 separate reasons. The first reason being I wouldn't want a genetic child to have the chance of getting it. My depression is my own personal Hell, and I would be afraid of passing it along. Even if I were to adopt, I would still be managing depression the rest of my life, and there would be days where I would be completely broken down, and I wouldn't want to expose a child to that. In the event I got really sick and committed or even attempted suicide, I feel it's not fair to the child.  Another reason is because if there IS the chance I get better, I want to live the life I wasn't able to live due to my depression. Go traveling, clubbing, party, and I can't do that with a kid.  Finally, I have a neuromusclar disorder, and while I am one of the lucky cases to be walking normally, there is a 50% chance I can pass it to my genetic child, and their case may be worse than mine.  I sometimes get selfish thinking, like, ""Who will take care of me when I get old? Well, I can hire help for that. It wouldn't be the same as family, but eh."
infp,3djs75,MoonCub,7,Thu Jul 16 22:17:16 2015 UTC,"really? i feel like INFPs might be more likely to NOT have kids. we're lovey dovey, but we're also really independent and self-focused. i imagine many INFP 4w5s in particular don't want them for this reason. haha i'm too self-absorbed  i'm only 25 but i feel pretty certain that i won't want them enough to justify having them. i'm also pretty sure i'm a lesbian and so it would be a ton of extra effort; i would need to be positive that i wanted this."
infp,3djs75,bezald,5,Thu Jul 16 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"I care about people who already exist too much to bring more people into the world.  If I ever have kids, I'd like to adopt.  My INTP partner shares that sentiment.  That might not ever happen, either.  I think when I am done with college and have more free time, I would like to be more civically involved and help more people than the ones in my house, so I'm not sure I would have time to raise children.  But oh man, it has always been a dream of mine to be an aunt."
infp,3djs75,annamalous,3,Thu Jul 16 23:58:42 2015 UTC,OMG RIGHT! So many kids are already suffering in this world living without parents and in and out of foster care being abused.

infp,3djs75,Eris_Grun,6,Fri Jul 17 22:53:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a 30-year-old INFP lady, and I also don't want kids and never have. My INFJ husband is in total agreement. I've never felt my ""biological clock"" ticking, and being around other people's children, even the ones I really enjoy spending time with, always makes me glad to get back to the peace and relaxing atmosphere of our home. We're both very passionate about our work, and in our downtime we love being able to spend time together being introverts and hanging out/having deep conversations/attempting to determine the meaning of existence/playing board games/traveling/sexytimes/etc. None of these activities are super kid-compatible. Freedom is a big part of it - we both want to be able to make whatever choices are going to enrich our lives. We love our niece and nephew and always enjoy spending time with them, but kids of our own are never going to happen.  I'm really sorry you've been dealing with the frustration of other people assuming they actually know what you really want, and that the most valuable thing a person (usually a woman, but I think men get some pressure too) can be is a parent. Lots of people contribute to the world in important ways that they wouldn't be able to if they had kids, and it sounds like you're one of them. I hope that that sort of judgment eases up once it's clear that your decision is final, and I hope those people come to understand that your existence is just as valid as theirs and your contribution to the world just as crucial. We've been lucky enough to avoid most of those comments, but a few hints have been dropped on my in-laws' side about hoping for grandkids (mostly from their friends, not my in-laws themselves). However, they don't actually know that we specifically intend NOT to have kids, and we're not quite sure what their reaction will be. We're figuring we'll tell them if and when they ask us directly."

I cannot even begin to explain how much it angers me when my parents condescendingly tell me ""You'll change your mind one day"", or that I have a ""biological clock and it'll kick in one day, you just don't know it yet"", as if they get to decide that they know my mind better than I do, and they act as if I'm abnormal for not wanting kids.

I'm very touch averse except for a really small subset of people who feel comforting. I'm being selfish but not really. Even normal things people take for granted are 20 times harder for me coming out of a mental fog and almost constant sadness these days. I once spent an entire day freaking out about a possible stove I'd left on before I left the house. I'm FUBAR and the thought of progeny makes me freak out like nothing else. How can I take care of someone so young when I can't even look after myself?

infp,3djs75,OhMyBees,2,Fri Jul 17 13:44:21 2015 UTC,I got a vasectomy when I was 27. Best decision I ever made.
infp,3djs75,chunes,2,Fri Jul 17 02:28:43 2015 UTC,"100% agree.  I am F(24). I really like kids. I loved doing babysitting and work experience in primary schools. However I've always known I absolutely did not want children of my own. As a young girl I thought my friends who wanted Baby Born dolls were crazy!   Some of my reasons are selfish and to do with the impact on my life:  Basically giving up your free time to devote all your energy to this being that you are totally responsible for, every minute of every day.  Having to work more in order to support your child, which consequentially means you end up spending less time with them, which is not an ideal way to raise a child. It hurts, makes you fat, ruins your sleep forever, can cause depression, relationship strain.  Other reasons are that the world is a horrible place, and I'd be so upset if I had a child and had to see it be upset/hurt/fucked over.  I don't think the world needs more children - and I don't feel a need to 'pass on my genes'.  Also as it is, I have a hard enough time navigating how to be a good person in the world, let alone being responsible for teaching that to another human. I see the way some parents let their children behave and think, you shouldn't be a parent. Finally (and I'm a bit ashamed of this one) I worry that if a child of mine had character traits that I disliked, I wouldn't feel the kind of love for it that I should.  Girls I was in school with are now having children and constantly posting ultrasound & baby photos on facebook. Growing up people told me 'you'll change your mind'. When they did, I always dreaded the day that I'd suddenly wake up to discover all the important reasons I have against having a child were somehow taken over by a biological maternal clock controller overlord! But it hasn't happened yet!! In fact the older I get and the more I see of people and the world, the more certain I believe that having a child would be wrong for me.  I've read articles by women who had felt like this all their lives, but were pressured into having kids because society demanded it, their friends all loved it, their partner wanted to, or they were assured they would feel differently once they held their newborn in their arms. One woman spoke of the crushing guilt and disappointment just after giving birth when she felt nothing but tiredness and regret. She raised her children and gave them a happy life, but always felt afterwards that it had held her back in life. Her language is a bit harsh, but still, this kind of pressure shouldn't exist for women. You have to trust that you alone know yourself best.  I totally agree with you about freedom in life. I think how we choose to use our limited time on earth is the most important choice we make as humans, and it's unfair to be considered selfish or have to justify why you don't want to follow the typical path."
infp,3djs75,l-_-1,2,Fri Jul 17 03:36:04 2015 UTC,"I don't want kids at all. For so many reasons. Neither does my SO, which makes things easier. I have nothing against kids, I've grown up around younger siblings and cousins and etc., I've done babysitting, and I'm sure I'd make a good aunt. I just don't want my own. Not now, not ever.  What I would like to do when I'm older and more secured is possibly do some fostering or take part in a Big Sister program. I really empathise with kids/teens from rockier backgrounds."

There are many kids who are not looked after properly, who are not taught morals, maybe even abused, so I would think that adding one (maybe two) well raised and looked after kids benefits society.   However, I also feel that we shouldn't overpopulate and squeeze the world's resources dry, but I don't think that one kid from two people would be a problem."

I day dream about getting married to prince charming and having 2.5 kids and the white picket fence really often, but when I see actual children in real life they make me feel really uncomfortable. I have way more social anxiety with children than I do with anyone else. Having the childhood I did I also am not sure I have the skills needed to raise a happy and healthy child."
infp,3djs75,knitterz,2,Sat Jul 18 03:37:01 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of babies. Kids are cute. I had never wanted kids when I was younger yet, as I get older, I fear loneliness as a 65-year-old. Family is a connection like no other, you can invest in them and they always have your back. I love my parents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, ect. Life isn't guaranteed; those you love will inevitably pass.   I am aware that not everyone shares this sentiment, but I would like to have people invested in me when I'm old. I also want to be invested in them, I want to grow my family and follow up on my children's futures and my grandchildren's hobbies. If anything, it'd be interesting to watch their lives unfold in front of you, them going through the motions that you had experienced not so long ago (childhood, adolescents, ect).  Having children is a sacrifice but also adds in lots of life experiences, especially into old age. You can have an ambitious lifestyle and children (if so you choose) but it takes planning and a supportive partner. I intend on pursuing an ambitious career and will have to put off having kids for quite a while (no rush)."
infp,3djs75,UnRaisinable,2,Fri Jul 17 03:10:42 2015 UTC,"We all live and die alone. Whether you feel it or not, we are all completely alone in this world, and will die the same way, regardless of the presence of loved ones and children. For myself, I hope assisted suicide is an option when I am old. I want to die a man and not wither away in a bed somewhere. I don't mean to be morbid, I love my life and the people in it, but I'll be damned before I suffer the fate of my grandfather, and his father, and his father before him. (Strokes are an extremely common way to die in my family, and I've seen proud, strong men reduced to hallucinating heaps of skin and bone in the course of a month. I won't suffer through that, for my sake and my family's.)  And sure, the lifetimes of others are all well and good, but I have no desire to sacrifice mine entirely for the sake of someone who may or may not be worth the effort. Even serial killers have parents, you know? 25 years commitment applies to both a murder sentence and having a child, and I can do a whole hell of a lot in 25 years.  Like I said, I like kids. Kids are great. But at the end of my life I'd rather have an plethora of accomplishments follow me to the grave than have a few more people standing around me as I return home.  One last thing: Yes, I can imagine being a lonely 65 year old. I've felt alone my whole life thus far. I've had lovers, great friends, and a loving family, but at the end of the day I'm still alone in my bed with my thoughts and the dark around me. Neither the passage of time nor the choice to have children will change that.   I support anyone who wants kids. But for me, I'd rather be lonely and accomplished with a lifetime of experiences and freedom."

Life itself is a risk, no matter where you decide to hitch your wagon to, no one is aware of what lies on the road ahead.   I can relate as I too often feel alone with my thoughts. I know there are friends, family, and many people out there who love me yet what fuels me in this world is supporting people who are in need. I see a child as someone of whom I could personally invest in and root for throughout their life. Seeing this little person develop into a full grown individual with their own hopes and dreams? This is a once in a lifetime experience and one I want front-row seats! It's something you can experience, as you had said you have the love of your nephews.  Children are both a commitment and a lot of responsibility. You don't know if they'll love you, that they'll be good people, that they'll even live to be adults. It's risky business. I'm sure it's all this idealism/dreaming with my head, yet I can't get over how proud I would be to see my child grow to become this individual with their own dreams and desires... their own quirks, flaws. It's a choice that I had never wanted, I never ever wanted children when I was younger. It's a decision everyone has to come into their own, one in which you can contently see as a large (very very very large) part of your future.  You keep your head on straight, you'll have lots of accomplishments in your future. We all have to enjoy our life while we're still here."

They'd have all of these expectations and obligations from their parents and the world heaped upon them and then they'd be expected to cope with that and the horror of the world, and for what? My personal satisfaction? Nope. The world is a shitty inheritance. I wouldn't be a good mother anyway. I have trouble coping with my own problems; I couldn't deal with a tiny screaming human.   Freedom is a huge motivator as well. A kid would be a  significant limitation to doing what I want in life. Plus, you'd have less sexy time with a kid. Who the hell wants that!?"

I am full of love, and I know I would do anything for my child, I would lay down my life. I often get teary eyed when I am around my much younger cousins (I'm 15+ years their elder - had teen parents) because they are so precious and if anyone hurt them I would fucking kill them, if they get hurt it breaks my heart. Then someone puts a baby in my arms and I instantly feel like its so wrong and horrible! I don't like babies anywhere near me, they freak me out and make me anxious. I could hurt it, they seem fragile and when they cry I have no instinct what so ever on what the hell I am supposed to do and I get upset and they cry harder and someone spots my panic and ends up taking them from me.  So in my mind (perfect dream world fantasy in my head) children are great but in practice they scare the living shit out of me!

I got the idea that if I went to Africa (after seeing a documentary) and taking some root and having a life changing epiphany that I would majestically be better. So many other people say it happens to them. They see ""God"" or their true inner selves and it inspires them to become that on the outside. I feel like that is something I desperately need.

Eventually I just got sick of being a sad bitch.  I analyzed what was most important to me in life and made it my goal to work towards fulfilling those needs and desires.  Mostly it just comes down to a change in mentality.  My thinking went from ""I wish I could escape this life so I can do what I really want to do"" to, ""This process is just a means to a greater end.""  I stopped letting my job define who I am, and defined myself.  Now I don't introduce myself as Eric the IT guy, I introduce myself as Eric the musician who happens to be good with computers."
infp,3djtal,etakcats,5,Thu Jul 16 21:08:54 2015 UTC,"I think I get what you're saying but to me its totally cool and not ""very fake"". Aren't we all different persons to different people? I'm not the same person to my grandma as I am to my best friend. Sure a lot of my core-values always stay the same, but my purpose with the interaction, my way of conversating, how I talk, what I talk, who I talk. All that changes as I float around. Isn't that what makes it interesting, too? Like how you can push discussions different ways, or how they listen depending on how you phrased it.    ""You just cull together all these things you hear other people say and put them together into something you think is a personality""   Interesting, so you take a little bit from this place and a little bit from that other place, and then in the end you have your own idea about it. Isn't that exactly how it is? Does that scare you?"
infp,3djtal,hungryhappysleepy,3,Thu Jul 16 22:08:34 2015 UTC,I suppose it is an amazing thing. Although surely it should be something that happens subconsciously. It scares me that I notice myself taking mannerisms from someone. I'll see a girl in a film have a certain 'edge' to her and I'll instinctively try to imitate that. I have no idea why I'm so aware of it now but it makes me feel weird. Like all I really am is a character.
infp,3djtal,hungryhappysleepy,3,Thu Jul 16 22:14:43 2015 UTC,"Oh yes.... totally. When I think about it... It's actually my ideal-self that I try to imitate.      That 'edge' that you saw in the girl. You add that to your ideal-self, the way you want to be, the way you could see yourself be in a few years time. And then you try to live up to that ideal. I know I've done that. Also, I've done that successfully.      Because the ideal-self is how I want to be, and how I want to be, is eventually how I will be more or less. This is sorta like fake it til' you make it, and I think that works in a way that it doesn't have to be that fake. Because you adapt the style -- or the edge -- but in the end... you do it in your own way."
infp,3djtal,KthuluKat,3,Thu Jul 16 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's fake. Some people just bring out certain aspects of yourself that others don't. Some are hard to talk to and some aren't. If you knew how to ""act natural"" and you did, why would that be any more authentic? You're just acting like yourself, and yourself doesn't act like you in a vacuum. You're going to react differently in different contexts and with different people. Your personality isn't one dimensional, it's dynamic.  It sounds like you have some anxiety, too. You may want to talk to a therapist about it. They can help you work on your self-esteem and assertiveness."
infp,3djtal,KthuluKat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:09:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. I suppose it is a thing that anything you're conscious of doing is in some way 'fake' because you're aware of it happening, in my mind anyway. I do over think a lot though."
infp,3djtal,strkst,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:26:02 2015 UTC,"You've given me something to ponder there. I think I hold myself to that standard to some extent: that anything genuine should be spontaneous and impulsive, not deliberate or thought-through. If I were to only act on impulse I'd be a terrible idiot, though. lol    I feel fake a lot, too. The person I want to be and the person I am are two very different people and it's hard to reconcile that. I end up feeling like something I'm not. But, in the end, you can only really act like yourself. Even if you were to lie and manipulate, it would still be a result of who you are and what values you hold. To me, whether you are being authentic is the wrong question; the question really should be: do you like who you are? Can you respect yourself? That's what's important."

The idea of being the same you around all people definitely is the ideal and most satisfying way of being.  People dont care all that much I find in terms of the representation of others. How they present themselves to all of you should be using a good amount of their energy as it is.  I used to want to be liked by everyone and obviously I still do in the most fundamental manner. The thing I had to make myself realize is that trying to manage every persons expectations is like trying to control the weather.  I like to ask myself this - If I dont like everyone why the hell do I need everyone to like me?

Recognize the people and habits in your life which don't serve your greater good, by making you feel bad about yourself or by making you act in ways that you think are not okay.  Cut them off or back away from them a little.  Recently, I moved out of my parents' house.  I love them, but our views on life and morality are very different.  Though I still spend time with them, I don't feel my well being is hinged on how well we get along anymore, and I can be myself in my own house.  Feeling like ""myself"" comes more naturally without the looming threat of being kicked out.  Make sure to take time out to have quality time with yourself.  Do things you know you enjoy.

I was friends with a group of girls and I wrote one of them a letter to express how much I appreciated her friendship, especially because I'd only had guy friends before that and I was bullied some the year before. I gave it to her while we were lining up to go somewhere. She opened it and started reading it in front of the group and they laughed at it. They'd have these secret meetings they'd exclude me from, too.   I've never been close to my friends, actually. I was always too quiet and when I did speak up they ignored me.

infp,3dkxko,SuitedPair,2,Fri Jul 17 02:55:39 2015 UTC,"The love of my life is an INFJ so I can say from experience it's probably not about in incompatibility. In fact, if you take the advice here and are patient, you might find yourself incredibly lucky  to have a mother who is so similar to you as you get older.   Yes, your functions are opposite of each other so communication is much more difficult than it would be otherwise. However, as two NF's you likely have similar goals, motivations, and values in life. That's incredibly beneficial in a familial relationship. On top of that, you're both introverts which is nice! It's just the way you both take in information and communicate is flipped. My girlfriend and I had to really work at communication and understanding how the other experienced the world. Talking about the MBTI functions helped more than anything for us, so I'd encourage you to try that.  As a side note, I have a very unhealthy ESFJ mother, and not only is communication very difficult, but we have very little in common and very different values. I'd have really benefited from a fellow NF parent growing up.  I hope things get better though, we're not good at maintaining unhealthy or difficult relationships, especially with someone we love. It tends to weigh heavy on the INFP soul, so be good to yourself! Know that as long as you're not an adult, it's more her responsibility to foster communication and more difficult for you to not fall into a child pattern. It will naturally get easier as you begin to see each other as (closer) to equals."
infp,3dkxko,DavisKennethM,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:53:59 2015 UTC,"I don't have any mystical words of wisdom to share with you, but I would like to say that you're definitely not alone in the situation you described, it's very valid and also a lot more common than you probably realize. Personally, my mom is a very unhealthy ISFJ, she's also a lot older than most people's parents because I was adopted, and she adopted me when she was 60, and fast forward 21 years and you have my 81 year old mother, always trying to assert her way of doing things onto me. Honestly, I love my mom, she's been there for me and done so much for me, but at the same time there can totally be personality conflicts, that's all it comes down to in the end, is the fact the people are different. Do you dislike your mom? It doesn't sound like it. I mean you even said that you love her and you always try to listen to her. In my own opinion, I feel like this is one of those inevitable things, chances are as you continue growing and trying new things, you'll encounter a lot of people who are similar to you mom, but now you have a thorough understanding on how to deal with people like that. Think about it. Jobs, school, university, who are often the people taking charge and put in positions of authority? Judgers. Sure, Perceivers are here and there in boss-type positions, and they can do a good job when they put their mind to it, but still overall from what I've observed, Judgers are overrepresented by a long shot. They thrive on that kinda stuff.   I actually just got a job at a pizza place, and my boss is a classic ENFJ. I know INFP's and ENFJ's are supposed to get along and all that, but I've always been the outlier, even with MBTI, so when I started working with my boss and analyzing her I started using my knowledge of how my mom is wired, and I've managed to make a really good impression. The second I knew she was a Judger I said to myself: ""I'm never gonna be late, ever"" and I haven't been, and she's even brought up how my punctuality is a ""strength"" that I have, when in reality I've been chronically late for like everything my whole life, from school to appointments, to every single class at school, to hanging out with friends, I am the king of being late. I just simply realized something and worked at it, and here I am, I actually got the job through a friend and my friend says my boss likes me which is surprising because most bosses/teachers/authority figures don't like me. So it's highly unlikely that you'll have the exact same kinds of situations I've been in, but all I can say I do your best to use your understanding of people different than you to your advantage. Like, seriously, with my job we make a lot of pizza and not all of it gets sold all the time, so on the weekends they have a charity that comes and picks up the pizza that doesn't get sold, but during the week people either have to eat it or it gets thrown out, right? So the owner has no problem with us eating some food here and there, as long as the job is getting done. So, I went to work one day and busted my ass, and halfway through my shift my boss asks me if I've eaten at all today, and I hadn't so I told her that, she said ""you have to eat something, make whatever you want"" so I made a Canadian and it was glorious, but if you've ever made pizza you'll know it takes a while for the cheese to settle and the crusts to harden and what not, so I'm standing there folding my pizza boxes (which is part of my job) and my boss walks by and says ""Are you eating? Where's your food? You have to eat"" (Like I said, classic ENFJ) and I'm all like ""It's right here, I'm just letting it cool down a bit"" haha  And seriously I don't think I would've had the social knowledge or wisdom to be on such good terms with my boss without having a Judger for a parent. And maybe you won't ever work at a pizza place with an ENFJ for a boss, but chances are there will be someone at some point who has some kind of power over you, and that person will be a Judger.   Best wishes :) even if this isn't the answer you're looking for I hope it works out as good as it possibly can for you :)"

It seems that everyone that replied has been in put in a similar situation much like mine, It truly is interesting to hear about how other people deal with this.

It's weird, everyone talking about break-ups like its just a normal thing that gets over. I think that shit is scary, so many things are happening. There is for sure something being broken in there. I felt my whole magic being lost to the outside world. And that was something new to me. The trees wasn't that majestic anymore. I suddenly couldn't walk around with random thoughts popping up in my head. I would do good as an animal because then I could express my feelings without having to say anything No. Nothing fun and easy like that anymore. Everything seemed flat. And overly-serious. Interactions were dull. Food tasted paper. Water was just water and not this preciously refreshing drink coming out of my tap.     But for sure mate, that's just a period of time. And you know that. This time is no different. These things, as confidence too, come and go. It's totally cool having a little dip in your otherwise amazingly rising life-appreciation-curve. We have to see it as just an interesting thing, this little dip. Because you know you can be That guy. Maybe just not right now. But look at this time as an opportunity. Once again. An opportunity to re-evaluate yourself. You have the chance to better the things you wanted to before! It's a slow process, but hell, you have time. Better doing it for real.    My greatest wish is to have a loving wife some day and I feel like I'm wasting my time with all this anxiety not going away, because certainly there is no way I'll ever attract the right woman in the state I am now.   Sorry man, but seriously.... fuck that. At least for now. Alright? You will have that within time. But that's definitely not what you should be thinking about right now. Do you really wanna be half a man looking for the other half? Be happy being an awesome You, first and foremost. Do whatever you can to be a better version of yourself, and don't expect it to happen over night. You'll come back a champion soon enough. Exercise, preferably something exhilarating. Spend tremendous time doing that thing you like doing. You know what you have to do so just do it.  Life's weird mate. So let's just laugh and not be too serious about it. Socializing and interactions, definitely, are fucken weird. Motivation, coming and going? Weird. Passion and enthusiasm suddenly lost? So weird. Let's just smile at it. What else can we do?"
infp,3djmoj,hungryhappysleepy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"You mentioned at one point that you are worried that you're   wasting my time with all this anxiety not going away   You need to put this worry behind you. Don't focus your thoughts so much on women just yet. You were in a long, damaging relationship. Usually it takes about half as long as the relationship was to fully recover but with a traumatic breakup of course it could shake your security a bit.  I think right now you should only be focusing on friends, don't pressure yourself with this concern about finding a woman ""before it's too late."" It's never too late, but by worrying that it might be, you make yourself much less attractive even as you said in your post.  So for now, just go for the little victories: be shy, if shy is how you're feeling. Stop doing the walk and talk on your phone. Sorry but you're beyond that now. Be willing to have passing little greetings with strangers, I know you feel anxious but you can do the little stuff. Don't put any pressure on yourself to perform socially at a certain level, just aim for a tiny little bit of progress to begin with.  Talk with people who you wouldn't date. Try to come across as friendly and nonoffensive. Accept that you are shy. You don't have to make friends with everyone, but just try to come across as friendly and nonoffensive in passing and you will get positive responses from people.  Start it out small, friend :) you'll get right back there and you will feel silly for having worried so much."
infp,3djmoj,thundermanbearpig,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:05:24 2015 UTC,"Mine actually came from a combination of being raped repeatedly by my ex, and just in generally having shitty friends, and my parents being complete shit heads my whole life ( I got a lot of I wish you were never born's growing up ). All of this caught up with me all of a sudden when I was around 22 years old and it halted my life completely. I can't walk out of my house, without anxiety. I can't eat out without feeling like people are looking at me. I hate school (I love learning so this is the worst) because I feel like my classmates are always talking about me.  I've tried multiple times to kill myself. I went from being able to conquer the world all by myself to needing someone there to hold my hand everyday almost over night. What made it worse was when my scoliosis started making my hip, knee, and ankle hurt on my right side and I couldn't run anymore. I loved running so much and it broke me.  I've been struggling for three years now. Just when I feel like I am making progress something is pulling me back down, and I go back to self harm, and being a shit head to my self. I'm so damn determined though and its the only thing that's saved my life. I need things done just right which included how I kill myself.  At least I can confidently drive my car around... to bad my ex and my ex friends drove anyone that would have been a good friend away cause I'm at 2 for my friend/support group and its my current fiance of 8.75 years and my sister... I don't have anyone else so I don't have anywhere to go when I get in my car and want to go out. Can't visit friends cause I don't have any, can't spend money because my anxiety is so bad I can't hold down a job...  I'm too introverted then combined with the SA and I don't have a chance in hell.  The only things that have helped me is going to therapy, and making myself stay close to my fiance, who is luckily or unluckily also an introvert. Lucky cause I'm not forced to interact but unlucky because I probably should be forced to interact. I find CBT to work pretty well, because it gets you into the water without getting you soaked, you work your way back into society but I don't care to do it half the time.  I keep getting told by my therapists that I sell myself short and they think if I can manage to start looking at all the good stuff I do and accepting I am good it might help me get over my anxiety.  So at the very least, you're not in this alone.  Which is why I even bothered to post without having an exact way to help. I'm with you, and it sucks but and a therapist is probably your best bet because they already have all the know how to get you back on your feet. BUT You HAVE to cooperate. I'm excellent at the NOPE I'm fine routine, so much so that I almost got discharged even though I was doing horrible."

When I'm talking to anyone, I'm simultaneously over-imagining all the directions in which our (non)existent relationship can go whether it's familial, platonic, romantic, etc and all these random fantasies just play out in my head completely out of control."
infp,3dh2h1,wispytea,4,Thu Jul 16 05:51:52 2015 UTC,That's a good way to put it!   But will it contribute to real affectionate feelings?  I feel like I'll never really be able to know if it's love or not.  I'm just very confused right now.  :/
infp,3dh2h1,heezeydeezay,3,Thu Jul 16 06:02:37 2015 UTC,"let me put to rest your fear of whether you will find love or not... one day you will get tired of 'over-estimating' everyone when it comes to the relationship thing and you will start to say. 'I know what someone I am attracted to ""looks like"" '. What I mean by this is that you dont know what their face looks like or their figure. But what you do know is what they ""look"" like in character and personality. Know and accept this and you will not see every person as a potential mate."
infp,3dh2h1,Tytillean,13,Thu Jul 16 16:57:42 2015 UTC,"This is something that has confused me for years, in a different way.  Understanding that I'm an INFP has helped me clarify things.    I have been in long term relationships.  My first boyfriend was someone I was with for 7 years.  Things didn't work out.  Now I'm happily married and we've been together for 10.    What confused me is that I've heard other people talk about how a relationship where you're ""in love"" is completely different from one where I'm friends with someone.  I have never found it so.  I feared that my emotions were dulled, but I think now that it's the opposite.  I am vastly more comfortable with my husband and more committed, more involved than I am with a friend.  It doesn't feel different.  It's still love.  It's different in degrees and what we do together.    To a far lesser degree, it's the same with people I just meet on the street. I am concerned for their welfare, even if I don't know them.    The only time this changes is if someone has really pissed me off. I can disconnect the empathy if I'm angry.  So maybe you're like me and the feeling of attachment to people isn't unusual.  If so, the important thing becomes getting to know the person.  Maybe you'll work out and maybe you won't.  You just need to make sure you're a good match, if you can so easily love others.  It's easy to get attached to someone who isn't good for you and put up with it for too long.    A little bit of perspective can help you temper your reactions."

infp,3dh2h1,obliviousDynosoar,5,Thu Jul 16 17:44:59 2015 UTC,I think when we talk to a girl and we see that there is some connection we amp it up 50 times inside our brains. Its like making a dollar off of some silly thing we did and imagining making 100's 1000's more off it.  We are visionaries in a sense. I think its important to take ourselves out of our own box and try to ground ourselves in what we're actually perceiving.

I feel almost the same and was talking about this with a friend yesterday. Except that when I'm interested in someone it is like no one else exists. Have been talking to this girl for more than a month now, went out just twice. I have o idea where it is going, but I pretty much act like there is no other girl in the world. I like her a lot, I feel that every flaw she has is something unimportant that idc and I think we would work well together and that we should marry and be happy ever after. I tend to feel that very easily though."

infp,3dh2h1,tigerscomeatnight,2,Thu Jul 16 06:12:36 2015 UTC,"I tend to do the same exact thing, and it's really difficult.    Yeah, the bad part for me is that more often then not it doesn't work (cause, you know, two people that like each other enough to be in a relationship is something hard to happen lol) then it is like I spent too much time interested in someone for it to get nowhere, then after that I take a break like ""yeah, whatever"", stay ok for a while, meet someone in a really unexpected way, repeat cycle.  And it always feels like it will go forever this way even though I know that cycle has stopped many times for me lol.   how will I know if I actually love someone?    I don't know, but why would you try to define what love is anyway? Everyone feels something different. As a matter of fact you are probably gonna feel something different towards each person you love, it's all love anyway.  Sounds dorky, but what I'm trying to say is: stop carying about if it is ""really"" love and just feel it.  Also, I'm somewhat old I guess (24) and have been in a few long term relationships and (at least for me) I think you stop easily falling in love at some point. As in you approach that in a more down to earth way and gradually fall into that if it is good."
infp,3dh2h1,sum1rand0m,2,Thu Jul 16 06:42:43 2015 UTC,"Well put, thanks for the advice you definitely have a point with the whole love thing. Love is something impossible to define with words.  I guess all this confusion made me forget that."
infp,3dh2h1,sum1rand0m,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:55:05 2015 UTC,"Here's my view: Love is not just an emotion or a connection, but a commitment. To be in love is to be committed no matter what. This means YOU decide when you're in love. If you really care about someone and they make you feel amazing, then making a commitment to them in your heart is what takes things from liking them to loving them, and the level of commitment is the difference between loving them and being IN love with them. That's just my view, but I think it helps to have a sense of control over these feelings, to say ""I really like her, and we've gotten along so well lately. I'm ready for whatever comes next, and I know we can make it work together."""

I started to hang out with a group of guys that LOVED to talk shit to one another and being new to the group (and a little different) meant of course I got the most shit. I found that if you don't react to the shit then it becomes less fun for the people talking it. Also playing stuff off and being sarcastic let's them know that calling someone ""gay"" for the 1000th time is soooo funny I forgot to laugh.   I'm still good friends with these guys 10 years later and while there is still a good bit of shit talking it's in a much less hurtful way than calling people names."
infp,3di127,turdninja,2,Thu Jul 16 14:08:41 2015 UTC,"I used to be like this. I had all kinds of great theories about why it happens and coping mechanism so I don't feel too down and miserable. I used to try and toughen up and grin and bear it. Then I woke up. I saw how childish and silly that game was.   It started when I lived in South Korea and people would insult me in Korean but since I spoke very little Korean I had no idea what they were actually saying and I had no idea what to be insulted or feel bad about. So I didn't I would just smile and nod and go on my way. When people tried to translate for me, it didn't help because insults actually don't translate very well. It was all ""mu mu mu"" to me (as they say in Korea).   When I came back to the states I started doing a lot of meditation which helped mature me in many ways and see through this kind of manipulation. Now, years later insults don't even really registrar as insults that I should be insulted by. They are all just ""blah blah blah"" unless there is some truth in them which is great because I learned something about myself that I didn't know before. It will help me improve my life and the lives of the people around me."

I don't personally trash talk anyone I don't know or am not familiar with though, it's not comforting to me in the least.  Rather I prefer to joke around with people I know and say things that are very clearly not meant than saying anything potentially hurtful. I make sure my friends know I care about them in other ways, so it's kind of endearing to say otherwise and laugh about it.  Edit: Originally I was mostly a non participant, and there are plenty of people I don't like who will sling mud at me... but if it makes them happy then it's whatever to me.

Unfortunately I missed the deadline for the universities I want to apply to so have to take another year off.   The reason I feel like I'm waiting is because all my friends from my graduating class have left the island we reside on and they've all finished their first years.

There's been several instances where one of my dogs will get into the garbage or something, and I'll absentmindedly start petting them while making them stop the bad behavior. My husband always has to remind me not to do that because it could make them think I'm rewarding them for being naughty. Logically I KNOW that.

infp,3dgwke,WiseEpicurus,2,Thu Jul 16 04:27:36 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite. I let people know when they've angered me when they know that they've done something wrong. In some cases, people have thought that I've gone OTT at times however, I do it anyway. Better out than in.   I think that some INFP's tend to bottle anger up because of the fear of conflict and hurting other people which ends up with them neglecting how they feel and putting others first. Also, we tend to feel our emotions more than others so, this is probably why they may not have realised you are very angry at them.  And my last point based on what you've said, you need to choose your battles. Somethings are worth expressing your anger about and others are not. If it's something serious then you need to let them know and try and make them understand why you're angry. Sometimes expressing your anger can do good than harm. Holding it in will make you resent that person eventually."

infp,3df4ej,-mickomoo-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:57:07 2015 UTC,"TLDR at the bottom sums it up just fine.   I worked as a busboy for a period of time. It actually helped me be more social, even though among the staff I was still usually just quiet. They didn't seem to mind me just standing around them as  they became distracted conversing with each other. But occasionally, while you're clearing/cleaning tables, a customer may ask where the bathroom is, or request some ketchup or something. If your presence isn't automatically removed from theirs after you help them with whatever, rather than bowing out awkwardly, you can just offer something like ""is there anything else I can help you with?"" [No, thanks] ""Excellent, enjoy your meal/evening."" And don't worry about saying the exact same things, they're all different people and no one will know. So, you usually don't have to think too hard about how to appear socially competent. It helps to have that verbal exercise.  Plus, I think everyone should try working in a restaurant at some point in their life. You can meet some truly interesting people and (in my experience) people are just people - generally, they want to be polite to each other and everyone's on the same team in a restaurant. It goes like clockwork, sometimes. If a server looks busy and they're taking plates off of a customer's table, offer to take the plates from the server so they can go take care of other customers. You're low on the chain, but you secretly run the restaurant.   Kind of labor-intensive depending on the popularity of the restaurant, you're always on your feet. It can be frustrating at times, especially when the rhythm of the staff isn't harmonious.  TLDR I didn't hate my right-out-of-high-school job as a busboy, was quite a learning experience for me, and met some really good people. 7/10 would recommend as a good way to buy time to enter into the career world when you're ready and develop social skills along the way."

My dad wanted to throw a huge, lavish Italian style wedding where he would invite everyone he ever met or talked to in his entire life. I hate being the center of attention and the idea of hundreds of people focusing on me stressed me out, so I talked him into bringing it down about 100 notches. There are so many details to planning a wedding and choices to make that in the end no one even remembers, so my husband and I decided to pretty much keep it as simple as possible. I wouldn't have had it any other way. We went to Niagara Falls for our honeymoon."

I originally thought I wanted a wedding, but even starting the planning process really nauseates me. The whole wedding complex, the awkwardness of bringing everyone together, all the attention and the silly rituals, pressure from family, blah. We keep putting it off, but I think we'll eventually elope in Vegas, maybe with a few close friends."

I was still able to ""block out the attention"" and focus on the important people like my groom. We got married in a small chapel near a waterfall, took pictures there and reception in my home town at a small hall. The stuffy people went home then it was real smallish like party with lots of dancing, hugging and fun. Didn't drink a lot but felt like I was drugged with all the love."

We're not far from our 10th anniversary, so we're thinking of having the wedding we skipped as a vow renewal thing.  It will be a masquerade since I talked him into marrying me on Halloween.  :)"
infp,3ddv08,sherbets,3,Thu Jul 16 03:02:31 2015 UTC,"My husband and I did a super laidback outdoor ceremony in the mountains and only invited our closest family and friends.  There were no groomsmen or bridesmaids.  We each wrote our own vows and had a very personalized playlist for the ceremony and for reception, which was held a nearby pub.  All in all it was pretty ideal."
infp,3ddv08,llzzies,3,Thu Jul 16 03:44:19 2015 UTC,"I was so excited when he asked me to marry him.  He did it in a nerdy, cute way and I cried, because I was so delighted.  The next day I realized I had to plan a wedding.  People at work were SO EXCITED that I got to plan a wedding and I just wanted to smack them.    It did get planned. I also did become acquainted with the gastroenterologist, to deal with my newly found gastritis and IBS.  I think i had an anxiety attack the entire time I was planning it.  Part of the problem was that the recession hit right after we had booked the reception hall and then only half the expected number of people were able to show up.  Things were more expensive than we would have liked.  We currently live in Las Vegas and I dearly wanted to get married anywhere else.  We chose McMenamins - Edgefield as our location.  It was the county poor farm just outside of Portland, OR years ago and has since been taken over by hippies.  They now have a winery, distillery, brewery, numerous restaurants, concerts, glass blowing, a pool hall, golf course, food gardens, beautiful salt water soaking pool (with a bar) and random weird art all over.  We wanted a nice place to relax and enjoy it.    I was very nervous that his divorced parents wouldn't behave or that some random thing would go wrong.  Everything went well however and it was a nice time. We'll have to go back sometime to actually enjoy the being there part, without the wedding anxiety.  The only thing that i'm a little sad about was that the pictures were somewhat disappointing.  The photographer didn't take that many and I guess wasn't clear on some of the things I wanted.  Our friend did a better job, but she was in the wedding party.  Here's a small album to give you the idea though.    We're excited to be moving to the area next month, so maybe we'll get to visit Edgefield again soon.  It's so pretty up there."

infp,3ddv08,AuroraEndante,2,Wed Jul 15 16:51:26 2015 UTC,"I had a ceremony but we kept it small. Both ceremony and reception were held at a local hotel that overlooked the ocean. The hotel had a good banquet staff, so we just picked the menu and let them deal with that.      I don't have a particularly good relationship with my parents, so I pretty much planned the whole thing on my own. Though I have some amazing friends that helped when they could. One friend officiated the ceremony, which was short and to the point. My brother-in-law's band did the music for the reception.      I bought most stuff on a budget. Nothing too fancy. I made the centerpieces myself (paper lanterns surrounded by fresh flowers). The cake was a special order from the Vons bakery and it was delicious.      Oh, and we had our rehearsal dinner at a nice pizza restaurant. We just got a bunch of different pizzas and beer and let everyone help themselves.      I was still really anxious on the day of the wedding. That was unavoidable. But I was less anxious than I would have been if we hadn't kept it simple. And several people told us it was the funnest wedding they'd been to in a long time."
infp,3ddv08,tinybadger,2,Thu Jul 16 01:09:58 2015 UTC,"We went to the courthouse with just our immediate families, my grandparents, and my best friend. It was nice, but if I could rewind and do it again I think I'd choose a small ceremony in a public park instead - I feel like my nerves were worse because I had no control over how everything went, and weird things happened like a ten minute period (waiting for the judge to show up) where everyone sat in the jury box watching my soon-to-be-husband and I hang out where the lawyers usually sit... awkward. It would have been nice to completely avoid that sort of of thing. We would've loved to elope, but just picturing my mom trying to keep it together when I told her and then secretly crying about it later broke my heart too bad. We all went out for a nice dinner afterward, which was mostly awesome and I'm really glad we did it. I feel like the small ceremony was a good compromise and most of my memories of the day are good.  Two days later we had a reception for all the extended family and friends, which was surprisingly fun. We just did dessert and told people to dress casual (no dancing because I don't like dancing in public thankyou!), and it turned out incredibly chill and everyone had a lot of fun. I feel like it was completely the right choice to have a big reception that was completely separate from the ceremony - it was nice to see everyone and celebrate, and people were happy they got to be included, but I didn't have to deal with SO many people at my most vulnerable.  I really, really would recommend the tiny ceremony/bigger and more casual reception deal if it's important to you to include family but having a full blown wedding is a huge undertaking that makes your stomach turn a little. :)"
infp,3ddv08,dirtywood,2,Thu Jul 16 06:17:47 2015 UTC,"You sound similar to me - I just got married in May, but the planning was absolute hell. We would've contently ran off to the Caribbean and done a private elopement... I'm shy and neither of like being the spotlight of attention, so a ceremony wasn't very appealing. My mom had to go and remind me about how I would be jipping my father the opportunity of walking me down the aisle and giving me away. That was a big thing for me, and we didn't want to look selfish, so...  We decided to have our wedding in New York, as both my husband and I's extended family lives up there. It made more sense for us to go up than trying to help arrange and expect all of them to travel to us. It was hard to find a venue out of state, but we ended up having the wedding at Niagara Falls and a reception at a theater down the street, which I knew was ""the one"" the minute I found it. We were super lucky that they were willing to negotiate within our budget (and it is helpful to mention what your budget is so that vendors can say immediately if they can work within it or not).   I walk a bit of an alternative path... but our wedding was featured on Offbeat Bride here.  Ultimately, we both had a ton of fun, enjoyed spending time with family and eating delicious food and bottomless drinks. I actually told my husband I'm going to find an excuse to wear that damn dress again at least once a year! I'm glad we went the route we did."

When I finish I'll try to start reading (best thing you can do to learn a language IMO, that is if you can't resort to immersion) and as soon as can I'll start searching whatever info I need in German, and I'll try to entertain myself with German speaking media.  That's how I learnt English, at least. As for the oral part, I don't have anyone to practice with, so I'll have to try and read aloud, among other things.  The most important thing about learning a language is being able to think in that language instead of just translating in your head before speaking or writing. That is the hardest part and, I think, the part where I and many other INFPs have an advantage."
infp,3dgcgh,dontmindmeohno,2,Thu Jul 16 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"One of my areas of study is linguistics and foreign language! :P I've self-studied all sorts of languages from a really young age. There are lots of resources on Reddit and the Internet for language-learning and various methods/theories to aid you (I'm trying to avoid going full on language geek right now) - if you have a specific language in mind, feel free to PM me and I can lead you to sources specific to what you want to learn.  My advice is to choose a language from a culture that truly interests you and you're extremely passionate about. You want to learn their language because you want to be part of its culture and you want to watch its films, read its books, appreciate its art etc. Passion can greatly motivate you to focus. Of course, if you're like me, you're passionate about way too many cultures so you end up dabbling a bit in every language and it's a hot mess XD"
infp,3dgcgh,wispytea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:17:50 2015 UTC,"YUP that is my problem! I am interested in way too many things to focus enough on one language... I want to learn French, Spanish and Italian, but never get very far!"
infp,3dgcgh,wispytea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"Imo, one of the easiest ways to learn a language is to watch a TV series or lots of movies with subtitles (at first). Also, listen to podcasts & music without translations. Out of French, Spanish and Italian, which country produces the most TV/film + music + books that you enjoy? Imagine the language is a world where you have to familiarise yourself with. I personally don't believe that memorizing vocab lists and focusing on grammar is a good technique for language learning because it's so.... technical, lol. In the beginning when you don't know any vocab, listening to foreign podcasts/news seems stupid, but actually it's not. You're familiarising your mind with the sounds & intonations of the language - if you pair this technique with something like watching TV shows with subtitles, over time you'll begin to pick out words and recognise sentence formations from dialogues. What used to be just noise will slowly begin to make sense to you.   Think of how you learned your native tongue :) You have to absorb the language so that it becomes a part of you. Try reading baby books in the language you wanna learn! They are usually extremely easy with lovely pictures. Use context clues to figure out what each word is. Slowly build your vocab up like this, and then read more and more. Memorize & study sentences as opposed to how to form a sentence from separate parts. EG: if you study many sentences from books/other sources containing the word ""jumped"" in various contexts, you'll automatically grasp the meaning of this word and how to use it. You'll also instinctively know (like a native Eng speaker) that the past tense of jump is ""jumped"", and when you wanna use ""jump"" in past tense in a sentence of your own, you won't even have to think, X tense in X context = ""ed"" suffix so past tense of ""jump"" is ""jumped."" Doesn't that sound insanely complicated? xD The more you expose yourself to a language even if it's uncomfortable not understanding things in the beginning, the quicker you'll grasp concepts in the language by just ""knowing"" them."

I've tried duolingo and I prefer Memrise's teaching style tenfold. There are French to English and English to Ancient Greek online dictionaries floating around - I can only assume there are ones for most languages. For BSL, I used predominantly youtube. I'm in school right now, so money and time are not on my side, so using these websites have been a massive help.   If you can get a tutor or someone to speak the language with, do it.

I've overcome some major issues in my life but it's still hasn't come full circle, but I'm feeling good most of the time. There are times when I feel down and I get to be much more empathetic with people dealing with stuff.  Not as a way of ""see? there are people hurting more than you!"" type of comfort, but more of a ""we all have our own struggles but we find ways to figure them out or at least seek comfort with our peers"". Even when we are on our boiling point and just break down in front of a keyboard we give that to ourselves because we know someone knows, understand, and even the smallest thing can brighten someone's day if it's said with the purest of intentions.  I realized we are very empathetic people (at least generally and with people we like) and we all struggle with very similar things, like social anxiety, loneliness and sometimes even depression. But we also like to talk about our favorite things, things that take up our free time, quotes, videos. It's a pretty mentally healthy place to freshen out after the rough day we had in the outside world.  tl;dr empathy."

For INFPs the sadness and happiness are two halves of the same whole. We wouldn't be able to have such high highs of emotion if we didn't have such low lows. It's because we see the world and humanity as beautiful. It can be quite melancholic at times, while at other times it produces overwhelming joy.

infp,3dc7nq,macjoven,12,Wed Jul 15 21:56:23 2015 UTC,"I think there are two kinds of INFPs - healthy INFPs and unhealthy INFPs.   Healthy INFPs, while still introverted, tend to focus on things external to themselves like helping others, ideas, creating things or just generally absorbing the world around them.   Unhealthy INFPs (and I have known myself to do this too) get into a depression spiral where they go over the thing(s) that are bringing them down over and over and try to identify what they are doing wrong which turns into an orgy of self-criticism and fruitless introspection (especially when the thing that is bringing them down is out of their control).   So in answer to your question, I think that the happy INFPs are out there busy doing things that make them feel worthwhile and as though they are achieving something while the unhappy INFPs indulge in expressing their sadness and self-criticism in the mistaken belief that it will make them feel better (take it from me, it won't)."

infp,3dc7nq,ChimeraCheree,2,Wed Jul 15 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"I feel that unlike most people with depression that can have it come from mental or biological disorders(chemical imbalances or what have you) as well as emotional or physical trauma. For a number of INFP the sadness comes from feeling like the world is not the dream land we wish it were. It's not like we're oblivious and can't function we're adults after all. However all day long we see the face everyone puts on and the masks are so constricting we can't help but start to end up with a hopeless feeling that we might never fit in because all we want is the masks to go away while everyone else starts to become them.  Thus when we are alone at them end of our daily trudges through an insincere world we visit here around like minded people and can let out the sadness that we're feeling about the world around us.   Ideally this doesn't lead to actual depression and we'll all be okay but, after all that's my continued wishful thinking."

infp,3ddfwa,PsilentSycho,3,Wed Jul 15 12:10:27 2015 UTC,"The video is very symbolic, seems more Ni to me. Her lyrics seem Fe to me, she doesn't really create a dreamy fantasy world. hmmmm, I think she is actually ISFJ, I could be wrong though of course. Many people seem to type her ESFJ, but she even says herself that she's an introvert, it is easy to mistype people as extroverts when their jobs involve being extroverted.   Typing this is made more difficult because the person making the video might be one type, the person that wrote the lyrics might be another, and Taylor might be a different one altogether."
infp,3ddfwa,Poropopper,2,Wed Jul 15 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I know about the cognitive functions, but apart from Fi and Fe, I don't really know how they work. If would be really helpful if you could tell me a little bit about each function (more than that would confuse me)...  Wouldn't it be more accurate to type someone based on their cognitive functions instead of using the four letter dichotomy? It seems like the proper way, but I guess it's much harder...  I checked, and the song was a song was a collaboration between 4 writers including Taylor, the video was done by another person.  Thanks for your reply!"
infp,3ddfwa,Poropopper,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:25:29 2015 UTC,"Ni tends to view the world through a lens in order to gain a new perspective, they tend to be symbolic and seek patterns in ideas.   Ne will connect ideas together like a web, they consider possibilities and relationships between them.  Si is about contrast between experiences and have a strong attention to detail.  Fe is about external ethics, and expressing feelings that relate to a social group or setting, their morals derive from outside of themselves.  Fi is the opposite, their morals come from within. They take an idea and assess whether it is true internally.   I find using cognitive functions to be more accurate and helps me to really think about how the person I'm typing thinks, you only need two functions and you will have a general idea of their type so it's pretty easy.  4 writers o.o, I thought she would be the kind to write all of her own lyrics, I bet they wouldn't let her do it, lol.  I was actually looking for a good example of a Fe vocalist to compare Fi vocalists too (my Fi example is Florence and the Machine), so this really helps my understanding a lot too."

I don't know about you but whenever someone visited my grandma I used to go back to my bedroom and not leave until the guests were away.  Also I prefer to have everything ready if someone goes to my house: Clean bathroom, clean living room, some snacks, etc.  Maybe I'm just too squared but in my case I have little money left after I pay my bills so when people visit me or invite me for an improvised hang out time I feel insulted even if that is not their intention.   Whether they come to my place or we go out I spend money so for me it's a great gesture if they at least ask me if they can come or if we could go somewhere else with one week in advance."
infp,3daxz5,Spaggerin,2,Tue Jul 14 21:40:44 2015 UTC,"Glad i'm not the only one. A week or even a few days in advance gets me mentality prepared, and change my schedule around so everything fits in. And I also feel insulted because it's like they don't care I have plans already and things to do. And it makes me look bad when I continue to do my own thing. And not entertain or talk to my unexpected guests. Sorry I have things I planned to do, and your unexpected visit is not one of them, besides i'd rather be alone."

infp,3daxz5,europeandaughter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:21:02 2015 UTC,"Oh hell yes. I mean, I still live with my parents (high school) but I hate it, especially when someone comes into my room with questions/demands.    I think it's because as introverts we need time to decompress, and we do a lot of that in our bedrooms or houses. We like to be alone during this time, so when someone interrupts us, especially without warning it can be incredibly jarring.    Combined with my tendency to cut myself off from social contact for days at a time, I can come off as an antisocial jerk, but I'm working on it at least."

infp,3d9vn8,vdublove37,8,Tue Jul 14 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"I've felt extra lonely today. I think, in my idealized world, I had all that. That you seem to be craving. That I once was craving. Just that, she left me. And I'm back in the city where we once met. Everything reminds me of her. I really don't know how to handle this loneliness, as there is nothing and no one to fill this empty hole. I feel bad because I once had that fulfilment you are talking about. So it's possible. Definitely. It's out there somewhere. I'm afraid though. Having been taking away from all that. It's dark. Empty. Hopeless. I almost wish I never was that happy. Because everything else now. Is flat.      Reality strikes hard sometimes. Suddenly. I have nothing. Nothing nothing.      It's only memories. And experiences. But what do I do with them.      I guess. If you have something to put a smile on your face. Appreciate it. A friend that actually listens to you. Some activity to make you feel okay for a moment. I wish I had.      The nature is suddenly boring. The sun isn't that warming. My mums pancakes aren't that good. My old friends don't really listen. I feel bad for my family. They look at me and they see how broken I am. I wish I could be somewhere else. Just be lonely and useless. Without having try to be strong in front of my little brother. I wanted to come back and give love and smiles to everyone here. But I can't. I just wanna go back. To where I was perfectly alone. To where I could walk around without talking. Being useless. And unimportant to the world. Sorry I... your words woke up some true emotions inside of me. Thank you for them. ❤"
infp,3d9vn8,hungryhappysleepy,9,Tue Jul 14 19:30:40 2015 UTC,"Hello me. Have some music. And maybe some reading.  You did your part. She needed you, and you needed her.  You spent a lot of time together, you lived your lives. You learned.  But there comes a time when they just have to go. Things stop working, nothing is really wrong, but it's definitely not the same anymore. Everything has been said, there's nothing to talk about.   The end. It's not a happy ending, but it doesn't have to be sad either.  * * *  You were lonely. You needed something to do, something to care about. You tried what seemed like everything.  So you spent days, months, years... And ended up building a beautiful, colorful kite. You never saw it coming, and might have never realized it, but somehow, that ended up being everything you cared about. It could be like this one. Yes, you thought of everything. You wanted this to be the best kite ever. Lots of beautiful colors, and those little strings that flap around happily when you give them wind.  Wind. The air. Freedom.  There comes a time when it's all ready, all done. And there's only one thing you can do.  You have to let it fly.  So you climb a hill together. You carry it up there. The weather is perfect, and it's just as windy as it should be. You give your kite a last look. You know you will never see it this close again.   And you start running. As fast as you can, you give it momentum. You hold on tight on the string.  You reach out, and you can feel the wind pulling it upwards. You still hold on tight. But your arms start to really hurt. You are running what feels like the fastest you ever got in your life. So you start tripping. You're out of your breath. Your kite is trying to pull you up with it, but you know it's all in vain.  The time comes, and you let go. Exhausted, in tears, you fall to the ground, and roll on your back. You can see it clearly. Up in the sky, flying, beautiful. But distant. And with every second, it keeps going up, and away.  As it becomes just a dot in the sky, you finally break your gaze and get up.  In front of you is a breathtaking landscape. Your kite is still there, above all. But it's so tiny, in the sky.  You sigh, and start heading home.  For days, months, years… You think about it a lot. You think maybe you weren't meant to fly.  * * *  Eventually you start realizing things. You did everything you were meant to do. You remember the beautiful moments you spent together. You remember how you felt. You remember how mutual it was. Even if at the time, you might have not felt that way. It takes us time.  But she's gone. She is not coming back. She is somewhere else. That's all you know.  It's the end of this story. But you're still here. It's time for you to make a new one.   Take your time. Don't forget about your past. Don't force anything. Let things happen.  You are still here.  You will fly.    Yeah I'm not the first one who came up with the kite analogy. Props to whoever did it first. Thank you for reading. Now fly.  EDIT: I just went on your profile and saw that you're kind of into serious writing and things. I'm a procrastinating web developer. I'm in deep shit.

What I notice with myself is that when I'm in that self-focused mode of ""I need X, Y, Z and I'm not getting it,"" I'm incapable of actually getting it because I can't stop focusing on how I don't have it. The glass jar is in our minds and self-perpetuating. But I'm starting to notice that I have to give first in order to get -- the most trivial little thing that I can do for someone else, just for its own sake, is often enough to bounce me out of the rut. It gets my mind off myself and my pain, and it gets me a little moment of genuine appreciation and positive feeling between two people. It's a weird little inversion to me -- like whatever you have to give, however little, is what it takes to start the reciprocal exchange of energy that eventually forms the connections you crave, and so on and on. I'm not entirely sure how it works or if that's a coherent expression of the idea, but it's what I'm working with currently. So maybe, for instance, start asking people the questions you want them to ask you? At the very least it'll weed out the folks who aren't on your level."

Loneliness is indeed being one hell of a problem for me this year, romantically speaking. I see my friends every once in a while, but when they're gone...well, here we go again.   But once again, thank you."
infp,3d9vn8,SlowMatt,3,Wed Jul 15 02:19:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's pretty much the same. Sometimes I love that loneliness, but there are moments when I despise it. Thanks God I have Him and His word to keep me motivated, and even when I feel lonely in a bad way, I know He's with me. And that makes me feel better in a thousand ways.  As I once read ""The people were relating the story of the pain they had suffered, of their disappointed hopes, of painful days and sleepless nights. When the last spark of hope seemed to be dead, Christ had healed them. The burden was so heavy, one said; but I have found a helper. He is the Christ of God, and I will devote my life to His service. Parents said to their children, He has saved your life; lift up your voice and praise Him."" This helps me when I feel like the loneliness turns against me and I feel like is choking me.

The worst is when we don't listen to others and their way of living, closing out possibilities for a better, healthier, more in-sync living. Not only that, but there aren't enough people who think about Earth as if they were looking at it from space. It's a weird world, this Earth."
infp,3dc6di,thatguyhere92,8,Wed Jul 15 03:11:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't downplay the significance of someone else's problems and emotions like that. It would be much better to just say nothing at all."
infp,3dc6di,P51741,7,Wed Jul 15 08:37:45 2015 UTC,Sometimes (often) F types don't want advice.  Sometimes they just want someone to listen and be empathetic and be a friend.
infp,3dc6di,westofthe5th,3,Wed Jul 15 22:09:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you, but I have been through some sad and tough times. And it is easier to get people out when you have been there before and know what people need to hear. What you said is the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. But no I wouldn't consider you a dick for telling him what he needed to hear."
infp,3dc6di,sum1rand0m,2,Wed Jul 15 04:28:33 2015 UTC,"I suppose it depends on the person. Some people appreciate that kind of approach, others don't. Part of giving good advice is understanding that people are all individual with different needs and learning to deliver what each person wants.  Personally, your advice sounds dismissive. Like you're summing up his problems and trying to get them out of the way because you don't want to waste time on them. It doesn't matter if his situation is unique or not - it's real and it's happening and it obviously upsets him, so it deserves consideration."
infp,3dc6di,WibbleyWoo,2,Wed Jul 15 09:23:20 2015 UTC,"Well, it is better to ask them about how you come across however, I'm happy to give an opinion.   "" Yea man that's life sometimes, you spent most of your life on this earth without her, you went through the toughest times in your life without so its not a big deal.   As much as this is truthful, it seems like you're not taking in the fact that this was important to him rather than this being just a general situation.    Yea your sad, but that's life, your emotions and your situation isn't unique, people break up everyday, that's just how humans are, you'll get over it"".    To him, it is unique. You need to remember that for some people, it's hard to move on after a breakup. Everyone has a different coping strategy.  If I can't give advice to people, I usually just tell them that I'm in no position to give advice however, I can give an opinion. The majority of the time, I always try to be diplomatic. Not in the sense of sugar coating but rather put the advice in a way that they'll completely understand whilst trying to minimise the bluntness as the truth does hurt. For example, rewording what you've said:  ''I understand that you're feeling depressed however, I don't think you should worry about it as breakups are common. As much as you loved her, you can carry on without her and do great things with your life. Just think of all the thing you can accomplish! You just need to stay strong and eventually, you won't even have her on your mind.''  And lastly, you need to be a little more positive as much as your views maybe realistic to pessimistic. For some people, they need a kick in the back side as for others, they just need a bit of hope."

It sounds like you meant to give advice, so you were trying to help. However, it probably didn't because we just want to our emotions to be affirmed and aren't as concerned with actually fixing the problem (not always, but sometimes.)"

Between an idealist and a purifist, I would call myself an idealist; even though I LOVE the idea of starting a world with the best of our kind, even the best has their downfall, over a couple of generations we would be back to the starting point, because, even though many times we think society as an outside factor is the one to blame for the bad things in the world, I blame us as an inside factor (I'm generalizing but you get the point). We are imperfect people inside and out, every one of us, and obliterating our own species would not help in the long run. It would be an immediate solution that it would take its toll later on.  Whether an individualist, I imagine them as people who silently and willingly make a devastated world a better place, a light of hope. And even though our problems would never end, is that light in this world that would make us go forward and face the dangers we would lie ahead.  Even though both have their disadvantage, if I had to witness a post-apocalyptic world, I would like to be the one who holds people that just had enough, and tell them we still got a chance."

infp,3dbg6v,sum1rand0m,2,Wed Jul 15 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"I would pick the first option, the side that wants to save the world. Because even the the side the starts over, there is no guarantee the world won't get corrupted again. There is a chance for history to repeat itself. But on the side that wants to save the world by rejuvenating it, you are forced to find a way to fix it and give it new life. That society would have learned and not make the same mistakes again if it ever came to that. Making that society a lot stronger then one that reset itself but not having the prior knowledge of how to fix those problems. That reset in society would just be the easy way out that could lead to the exact same problem."

You can't unburn a cigarette, you can't separate a plate of mashed potatoes mixed with ketchup. Things are going to happen no matter what.  To me, life is like a river and we all travel through life flowing into and away from other rivers, creeks, streams, and deltas. There's a beginning and end for every individual, likewise a beginning and end for life as a whole. Families and communities will fall apart, and yes, they are bigger issues, but surrounding ourselves with the people we want around us is the best we can do. Not everything is perfect and we may never know the reason why this person or that person drifted away. The only thing we can really do is stay true to ourselves and gravitate toward or let in the ones we want to be a part of our life, even if we don't understand or will never know why things happen.

Plus, there's actually really cool fellas out there, in the world.   I don't know, it feels like you've tried everything. But maybe missed one of the key things? How good is it really, working writing for someone? You've been at the same job for 11 years??? Or was that the time together with your SO maybe. Anyways. I might be extreme. But I NEED changes. More often than I think. Sure I like comfort too. But changes... new possibilities... new ideas. I don't know. I wish I could come with something better. But I know the emptiness too. Like I used to have these endless nights when I never wanted to go to bed. So... keen on life. I still think I have that fire in there.. but honestly, I haven't seen it for a while.

infp,3d9z40,hungryhappysleepy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"Haha I feel you on needing change often, for sure. It's driving me nuts lately. It's definitely possible to live a life of change as long as you go into certain professions and can take the bad with the good. It sounds like you're doing well with nature hikes and getting out there to connect with others and are aware. I think people who get really in a rut aren't aware until long after they've arrived.   I hope my post didn't scare or depress you. Thinking about it later, things aren't so bad. My job is kind of fun, in that I develop stories on my own and write for a national newspaper and no one bothers me much. Yeah it's be more fun to write for myself too some day. Perhaps that's possible if I keep working at it. Change is such a difficult thing to pursue, after you get into your comfort zone for too long. Coming out of it can feel almost like a rude awakening. Continue to push yourself as it sounds like you are. Sometimes I try to balance my idealism with the reality of life not always being exciting or perfect (my poor SO, most likely an ISTP, is painfully aware of this). When we can do that, it seems we feel more content rather than always searching for something more. I dunno, just a thought."
infp,3d9z40,serylikos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've lost your joie de vivre: and that's okay. Lots of people do. I know you feel like you're alone right now, but it's not true - what you're going through is quite common and it can get better for you.   I think that you perhaps need to think long and hard about why you get up every morning - I don't mean this in a rude way. Sometimes when I'm feeling lost I take a bath and I plunge my head under the water and stay there until I'm gasping for air. At this precipice of this panic, when I know I'm about to start fighting for oxygen, I ask myself - Why am I fighting? What do I want to live for? And something pops into my head - a reason to keep fighting. And then I grab onto it and come to the surface.   Other than this, perhaps you need to go out of your way to pursue new things. You've mentioned that you are lonely and that you had a group of friends that you enjoyed spending time with. I think new hobbies, new interests - they're only going to help. Because you'll make friends doing new activities. In any case, they'll keep you busy at a time of overthinking.  I do truly hope that you manage to get past this. This type of crisis happens to a lot of people but I know that you'll be able to pull through. Talk to your SO about how you feel. It's great that you're seeing a therapist but maybe getting it off your chest to someone you know inside the situation can give you a new perspective and positivity. Best of luck x"

infp,3d9z40,knitterz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"So many ways you could tackle this. So. Many. You could take it from the action side of things: pick a goal and go after it with everything. Something interesting and challenging. Like living off 50%-25% of your income. Like tidying up your place permanently. (Those are my two current ones.) Like traveling around the world. Like hiking the Appalachian (or Continental Divide or Pacific Crest) Trail. Like going to grad-school. Like getting a promotion or higher paying job. And so on. For example.   Another way to tackle it is supplementing the therapy with meditation, The Work or reading people who can help you come to a deeper and more helpful perspective. There are many such people, Eckhart Tolle, Alan Watts, Thich Nhat Hanh, the Dali Lama, Sylvia Boorstien, Pema Chodron, to name some more popular ones, but my current favorite is Anthony De Mello.   If you are not so much into the spiritualish self help there is always plain-old-fashioned self help books around by the truck load. I found How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie and The Magic of Thinking Big to be great books even though they are decades old. There are tons of newer books along the same lines. I like the Four-Hour series by Timothy Ferris and The Art of Non-Conformity by Chris Guillebeau.  There are other things to do and try. Any positive change will bring more positive change on it's heels."

Meditation and self help has been a part of my life for several years now, and interestingly I just listened to Anthony de Mello for the first time today. The teachings of Eckhart Tolle and Pema Chodron are close to my heart. I was going to mention this earlier as well, but decided I didn't want to muddle the post further. Sometimes it feels as though my earlier ambitions and outlook on life in general did not mesh with these teachings, and so for several years things started to change, in my mind and emotions. I became more peaceful, monetary value and gaining the respect and jealousy of peers began to fade, but I also felt removed from others though understanding of them. But by not continuing to practice out of laziness and fear, I've become stuck. I can't go back now, because I see the fallacy inherent in the old way of living seeking large amounts of money, fame, beauty, ego, collective ego, etc. Its not that money is inherently bad, only that I want it to travel for experience, for example, not buy the latest car or most expensive purse.

I work from home currently as well and I get how lonely and depressing it can get never leaving the house. One small thing I try and do when I start to feel depressed or down is to take my laptop to a coffee shop or somewhere with people and wifi. Even if I only talk to the employees long enough to order and don't have personal interaction the rest of the time I am there, just being around other people energizes me. Sometimes when I don't need internet for a particular project I go to the park and do the same thing. Sometimes I will chat with those around me, others I will just work quietly.

I'm doing it a lot since 2 or 3 years, before that I used to let myself guided by my feelings.  It brung me nothing but trouble, in the external world but also in my internal world. My life hasn't utterly changed since I process like this with my feelings but my self-consciousness and self-understanding have improved and I introspect better. I might also say that I'm better at taking decisions, at least I don't regret them as soon as I make them."

If you're battling depression and severe anxiety, dating won't be any fun or give you what you're looking for. Get professional help first, love your life, and you'll find someone.   And as a 32 yo male, you're still pretty young. Maybe even in your prime, honestly. You can date both younger and older women. Get the help you need and remove the idea from your head that finding someone will fix you. Most people will also notice you are very depressed and anxious and it isn't exactly a good foot to start on if it's as crippling as you describe it.   Anyway. what you aren't too old for is meeting someone to be in a serious relationship with, as you hope for.

Being passionate about a hobby or two is very attractive but something that you can physically show off whether in a technical sense or physical sense (working out at the gym).  Advice or not I never want anyone to feel like this is hopeless situation. Having a significant other is one of the most wonderful things in life but it wont make you happy and at some point he/she will be another layer of insulation that combined together with other layers gives you that enduring contentment.  Cultivate yourself. We are not a piece of stone. We are a piece of broken glass by the ocean. Over time the roughness and jagged edges give way to beautiful contours that are smooth to the touch.

infp,3d86j6,underwaterdaughter,6,Tue Jul 14 07:02:49 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right that horoscopic descriptions are generalizing, stereotypical, and can't accurately describe every individual for each type. Studying the 8 cognitive functions extensively truly helps people type themselves. Online tests are just a starting point. But MBTI in itself is just an umbrella. Everyone possesses and uses all 8 functions. MBTI type only represents each type's stacking of these functions. Also, Enneagram type contributes to the variety in personalities.   That said, I believe that the users in this sub create posts not for the SAKE of fulfilling the ""horoscopic"" descriptions of INFPs, but because it is truly how they think. When they're talking about a work of art, writing something personal, etc... I don't think they're thinking, ""I'm gonna post this because I HAVE to think like this according to INFP descriptions,"" but because they do. And they're looking for other people with whom to share this with. Because we possess the same dominant functions, we likely receive and perceive information, such as a work of art, the same way. It makes this sub a great place for INFPs to come together and share experiences, offer support/advice, and so on.   But MBTI doesn't dictate behavior, and that's evidenced by lots of posts here. For example, there was that topic asking what/how people eat. Not everyone has similar eating habits. Sometimes people ask about introversion/extraversion - there are lots of varying answers from people who all type as INFP. Plus you can tell just from reading the way people type just in this sub that we all behave uniquely and are not carbon copies of each other.  I agree that there are many people out there (especially those who aren't obsessed enough with personality psychology to read a million articles on type & functions) who take the results of one test for granted and might not truly understand MBTI or might mistype themselves. But if they ended up in this sub, they definitely felt alienated enough in some aspect of their life or curious enough about themselves that they would find a community of people who are ""generally"" & ""supposedly"" (according to them), just like them. If this is where they feel comfortable and believe people understand the way they perceive the world, then my personal opinion is that it doesn't matter if they take it too seriously. They might not even be INFP, but if they post an experience they had or an insight they had and I can understand it on a deep level and share it with them, I don't care what their MBTI type is and whether or not it's a mistype.   But yes, if you seriously want to find your type and think ""wow I must not be INFP because they're dreamy af and I'm not"", take heed of OP's words. :)   Sorry for my wall of text too... Ne all over. LOL."
infp,3d86j6,wispytea,3,Tue Jul 14 11:58:30 2015 UTC,"I realized when I re-read the entire book that I missed out a lot the first time I read Please Understand Me II by David Kiersey which is the origin of the ""horoscopic"" MBTI descriptions. Back when I first read it 15ish years ago, I really only concentrated on the Idealist and INFP subtype. This gave me a hugely skewed understanding of what personality typing is getting at.   When I re-read it I realized that he was saying that all the types are intertwined. All the characteristics of all the types are in each of us. It is just that some are louder, more developed and more dominate, and they go together, and how developed or dominate they are is on a sliding scale that is predictable. Thus in Idealist such as INFPs, Idealist traits are most dominate followed closely by Rational traits and Guardian traits and finally Artisan traits farther off. For the other types the order is different, but again all of them are there.  So yeah. Type is not as hard and fast as people want to be in either MBTI's function model or Kiersey's Temperament model."
infp,3d86j6,macjoven,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:39:51 2015 UTC,Let me play Devil's Advocate.  Always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events. Once a person has struck a certain level of disharmony with me there is only containment and avoidance that follows.  Searching for ways to make things better? As long as my bubble is holding up I dont feel the need to put myself there to spin stuff in my image.  Communicate deeply with others? I can do small talk and I can do the vapid superficial type conversation that most people find much more entertaining.  Metaphors though? Till the end of time. Problem is I find myself using ones that I have made up and viability is a reoccurring issue at times.  I see what your saying though. I find that the easiest way to maybe decide how much of this or that I am is by ruling out what I exhibit to what is generally stated about us.  I'm starting to realize that there is something at the very core of us in terms of personal fluctuation or being a juggler of sorts that I think makes us INFP more than any single list of traits or tendencies. Thats my thought process.

I wouldn't go so far as to accuse others in this sub of taking their personality so seriously to the point that it is the only thing they focus on and profess. I mean, sure they might, but being vocal about it... that's not what I'm here for. Everyone is here for different reasons- some want to hear from others like themselves, others want to see if they really are who they think they are.

I've talked to a decent number of people, and yes while college is definitely a highlight of many peoples lives, it does not have to end there, unless you let it. In fact you can keeps making things better as you age!   People go into college like they have to spend every breathing moment releasing their imagination/ child like ways, because the adult world will not let you. And then after college they turn into slightly depressed/ nostalgic people who have a decent chance of trying to ""live through their children"" because they think they cannot use that imagination they locked up after they walked across that stage.

The idea of being completely selfless in the sense of not deriving any sort of satisfaction/pleasure/sustenance seems unreal.  At the same time I'd like to think of INFPs being the healer to others as a good mix of complete selflessness and re-energizing who we are.

Not so much an expectation but more of a good will begets good will.

I do this because I'm kind of sensitive and then I get resentful when people don't have the same consideration I do. I know it's really shortsighted and selfish (I'm sure there are times others are giving me a lot of time and attention and I don't notice.)   As much I love helping people am I helping this particular person because I sincerely care about them or is there a bit of a Jack from Lost esque ""I need to rescue someone"" aspect?   lol perfect example because I identified with that aspect of him."
infp,3d6ghe,StolenJewelry,3,Tue Jul 14 02:14:48 2015 UTC,"For me I usually have 3 reactions when I'm deciding on what to do or when someone asks me to do something.  ""Yes,"" ""Well... okay,"" and ""No.""  For all the ""Yes"" answers, those are the things that I agree with to my core. It's imperative that the above answers are instant gut reactions. Those are the things I truly want to do and would enjoy myself doing them. There's usually little to no hitch to doing these things.  For all the ""Well... okay"" answers I'd rather not do them but there's probably a responsibility. I tend to stack up a lot of these in school and work. The problem being that I tend to make other peoples problems my own problems that a lot of these ""Well... okay"" answers are things that I'm just doing for friends. They can add up and really wear down on my endurance when I see little return or appreciation for my efforts.  The ""No"" answers are things that I absolutely don't want to do while also either having the freedom of saying no or accepting the consequences of saying no.   And every once in a while I will take some time for myself to trim off any excessive ""Well... okay"" answers. I mean go through with them but try to end my commitment or just turn them into straight up ""No"" answers."

Unfortunately I didn't really stop being in the funk and also didn't stop distancing myself from people in this way. Most of my relationships now seem to have been polarised in such a way that the more self-centered people think I'm great to talk at because the subject matter is always them, and the more empathetic people have noticed that I choose not to share any meaningful aspects of myself and have reciprocated that with me.

Basically, I eat organic when possible, but if not possible, then I eat all natural. I avoid things like HFCS and Red #40 like the plague, but I'll eat things like MSG or artificial flavor if I'm in the situation to, which is rare. I'll only buy things that I can understand the ingredient list of, and preferably those things are organic. I always get my dairy, meat, cheese, and eggs (or any other animal product) organic, while things like rice or oatmeal or grains or fruit I will get conventional. I like buying my pasta organic though, einkorn wheat is amazing. But on occasion, I'll buy regular pasta too. Pasta sauce is pretty much always organic. Cereal is always organic. Chocolate is 99% organic, except that one time recently I impulse bought Dove chocolate because it had Rainforest Alliance cocoa. Really, just bought it once to support that. I usually buy organic and conventional cookies at the same time (Annie's bunnies, Anna's ginger thins, used to do Biscoff but they're expensive and Anna's are cheaper).  I am also a sucker to office food. Unless it's something nasty like conventional red velvet cake, I'll probably eat it, even if it has HFCS or colors or whatever. It's such a rare occasion, it's only happened a handful of times.  Unfortunately, due to preferring things organic, I often don't buy enough food for me to fix and eat. So I end up just drinking water throughout the day (Ozarka if you're curious- I tried ZeroWater but those filters claim your firstborn children) and only eat two meals a day, breakfast and dinner. As a result I am almost always underweight... it is hard to keep on weight.  Edit: as for emotional eating, not really. I can generally eat less if I'm sad or super into a game I'm playing or art I'm drawing, but it's not really a chronic thing.  ...I apologize if I scared anyone away at this point, haha."

infp,3d5hp2,umistbb,7,Mon Jul 13 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"Tests are a good starting point, but they aren't 100% accurate. I've read here that things can affect your results, such as depression, being unhappy at work or at home, anything that might make you think and feel in a way that is not really you. I, for instance, used to always test as ISTJ when I was in a job that required me to be much more distant and assertive than I truly am.   The best way to identify your type is to read about them and their functions. Do you feel like an INFP, or an ESTP? Or something else altogether?"
infp,3d5hp2,thats_ridiculous,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:14:45 2015 UTC,"When I tested as INFP I definitely identified with the description of INFPs, and now I also identify with the ESTP description... It's all really odd. I never read about any other type besides INFP/J in the past so it's not like I was intentionally working towards another type? Although it could be me unknowingly changing myself after a traumatic incident. I'm not sure. I really do honestly identify with what I'm reading as an ESTP now though! Odd."
infp,3d5hp2,KoenigAllant,5,Fri Jul 17 06:23:07 2015 UTC,"You do not change your type, I don't know why people keep thinking this. The problem with the test is that it is incredibly inaccurate and it is bound to the tester's honesty/self-awareness.  You really fucked up taking the test if you scored both INFP and ESTP because those are basically polar opposites."
infp,3d5hp2,snowflake030,2,Mon Jul 13 19:02:09 2015 UTC,Don't you think a lot of people just don't want to be themselves?
infp,3d5hp2,KoenigAllant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"You would have to take a conscious effort to score ESTP as an INFP, like really really try hard, this doesn't happen by accident because you subconsciously wish to be someone else. Especially not twice."
infp,3d5hp2,pandaonbeach,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:22:47 2015 UTC,"Before this I had never done any reading at all into any of the other types, so it's not like I had a model or type to work towards to. Believe me, I was astounded when I tested as an ESTP and thought it was a phase. Which is why I kept on taking it to see when I'd finally test as INFP again, and... I never did? I really feel like a whole new different person though, after a traumatic incident."
infp,3d5hp2,CritSrc,3,Fri Jul 17 06:25:39 2015 UTC,"That's impossible. We're way too different. I have completely different motivations, actions, drives, and beliefs than the ESTPs I know. We also interact with the world in completely different ways. I agree with /u/thats_ridiculous that it may be your job or current status in life that may change your results. Look at the Jungian Functions to see which one(s) defines you. Then find out which one of these matches you the most. Most people that tell me they are borderline between a P and J, which is laughable, as the P and J of the same types have completely different Jungian functions. INFJs use Introverted Intuition and Extroverted Feeling (Harmony driver), while INFPs use Introverted Feeling and Extroverted Intuition (Authenticity driver) - INFP vs INFJ."
infp,3d5hp2,onion926,3,Mon Jul 13 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"Look, if you were an a depressed ""INFJ"" suddenly turning ESTP I'd believe it, but INFP->ESTP?! That is just ridiculous, both types couldn't be anymore different, they work in such different, opposing ways that they usually clash vehemently when both are together.  But yeah, read up on the functions, throw away the stereotypes and see what fits with this loose theory. Tests look shitty when you get more into it."
infp,3d5hp2,CritSrc,2,Mon Jul 13 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"Your test results depend on how honest you are with yourself.  When I was in my teens, I tested INTJ, but that was because I was answering the questions according to how I wished I was as opposed to how I actually am.  Don't let the letters of the types mislead you, either.  For example, even though INFP and INFJ share three of four letters, that doesn't mean their functions are the same.  Like everyone else has said, I recommend you read more about the functions themselves and figure out which ones resonate with you most.  I also think poking around other MBTI type subreddits will help you figure out where you actually belong.  I had doubts whether I was actually INFP for a while, but after lurking on other forums for a few days, I noticed the way people communicated there didn't sit with me quite right."
infp,3d5hp2,zacfawstea,2,Tue Jul 14 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"I noticed the way people communicated there didn't sit with me quite right.   Bah, I'd say the same for /r/INTP, but I don't doubt that I am one."
infp,3d5hp2,redearth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:41:48 2015 UTC,"I would say that whenever you first took the test completely blind and unaware of of the types, is when it was accurate. It becomes bias past that point."
infp,3d5hp2,zacfawstea,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Many people, including myself, had less accurate results with their first test and more accurate (and consistent) results later on.   It's true, though, that with a little knowledge of MBTI, you can game the system to get whatever test results you want."
infp,3d5hp2,RosieODonnell,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:30:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, I still am blind and unaware of every other type because I'd never done any reading or research into MBTI types. Even now, I still have very shallow knowledge of INFP/ESTPs hahaha"

infp,3d40ou,macjoven,3,Mon Jul 13 14:53:22 2015 UTC,"I'm Muslim and I wouldn't consider myself a very religious one, but there's a story that really touched me that I think fits into this topic.    Muhammad and a bunch of followers were sitting down when he mentioned that the next person to walk in was the best among them and would reach paradise.  One of the followers asked to stay at his house and observe what he was doing that was so special.  He stayed with him for three days and didn't see him performing anything out of the ordinary.  The other followers seemed more pious than this man.  Fed up, he finally asked his host what he was doing that made him a man of paradise.  The host couldn't think of anything, but after a bit he said ""Every night, before I go to sleep, I forgive whoever has wronged me. I remove any bad feelings towards anyone from my heart.""  Looking at your issue from this perspective, what you have is not a problem.  You have one of the most extraordinary qualities that a person can have.  Keep doing what you're doing and don't let anyone tell you that it's a weakness."

infp,3d3dr8,hungryhappysleepy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:41:12 2015 UTC,"Which is why there is probably a larger population of introverts in online communities as opposed to extraverts. Online communication is selective socializing which is essentially what introverts do in real life too. We're more selective about the people with whom we interact with and feel better when we have control over social situations.  I like thinking of it as ""I prefer being alone but I don't like feeling lonely."" And being alone doesn't necessarily mean feeling lonely... it's a bit more complex."

These days i think it's pretty much been proven not so tho BC I became severely ill to the point where I've been mostly housebound over the past 5yrs (+ most of my now closest friends moved cities so I see them even less..) so the ""hermit-ness"" has no longer been by choice but still I could only count on one hand the amount of times I've ever felt lonely over these years (& that was whilst being ridiculously ill & unable to leave my bed..) Only missed being able to explore nature sites on my own.. If anything the extra time to myself has been a blessing & a relief to get away from other peoples drama which after the toxic group of ""friends"" had done my head in..+ being on my own so much I've explored my hobbies more & am now starting to earn from them, which is brilliant bc I'd always lacked direction in life before now..  Having said all this, I've always been the freak who has an affinity with nature & animals, prefer their company over most people & have a close bond with my pets who amuse me to no end with their totally different personalities & they don't bring in the human bs that irks me.

infp,3d2x15,kakemot,10,Mon Jul 13 02:30:08 2015 UTC,"Somebody once asked, ""What is enlightenment like? What is awakening like?"" It's like the tramp in London who was settling in for the night. He'd hardly been able to get a crust of bread to eat. Then he reaches this embankment on the river Thames. There was a slight drizzle, so he huddled in his old tattered cloak. He was about to go to sleep when suddenly a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce pulls up. Out of the car steps a beautiful young lady who says to him, ""My poor man, are you planning on spending the night here on this embankment?"" And the tramp says, ""Yes."" She says, ""I won't have it. You're coming to my house and you're going to spend a comfortable night and you're going to get a good dinner."" She insists on his getting into the car. Well, they ride out of London and get to a place where she has a sprawling mansion with large grounds. They are ushered in by the butler, to whom she says, ""James, please make sure he's put in the servants' quarters and treated well."" Which is what James does. The young lady had undressed and was about to go to bed when she suddenly remembers her guest for the night. So she slips something on and pads along the corridor to the servants' quarters. She sees a little chink of light from the room where the tramp was put up. She taps lightly at the door, opens it, and finds the man awake. She says, ""What's the trouble, my good man, didn't you get a good meal?"" He said, ""Never had a better meal in my life, lady."" ""Are you warm enough?"" He says, ""Yes, lovely warm bed."" Then she says, ""Maybe you need a little company. Why don't you move over a bit."" And she comes closer to him and he moves over and falls right into the Thames.   Ha! You didn't expect that one! Enlightenment! Enlightenment! Wake up. When you're ready to exchange your illusions for reality, when you're ready to exchange your dreams for facts, that's the way you find it all.

My idea of ideal isn't imaginative and based in fairytale, but rather in basic human decency, evolved communication, and general expansion.  These things are not impossible or even hard to reach if parameters would be set, but for now my way to implement these sentiments is to enact their nature first handedly.  I don't believe an escape is the answer to what's going on, especially when we are not necessarily anywhere special or specific, being that space (and life) is much larger than how we perceive it  Hang in there, live your life as you find meaning in it, and stick around a few lifetimes to live in revelation~"

You know, one of the biggest hurdles for INFPs is to just find what we want to do. Our idealism does trip us up a bit, but also leads us to be really good listeners and storytellers, which is why a lot go into counseling, writing, music, and art. My suggestion is to just think about what captivates you. What motivates you? What makes you want to dive in? What compels you? Write about it, and sort out your feelings. Writing in a journal is a great way to work through your feelings without having to feel like someone is looking down on you, judging you for being Insert all our fears here. Don't deny who you are. It's you, and you're wonderful. You are smart, and you are sensible, and you have standards that you expect to be met. Don't settle for less. And don't let anyone's half thought through words or weird tone of voice disrupt you from doing what you really want to do. And if you have to work a crappy job to make it happen, or if you have to move, or drop someone out of your life, just go for it.   Something a lot of people who adore MBTI often need to be reminded of, is that it's a measure of traits. It's not an ideal. It's not ""Who you should be."" Don't look at it and say ""I need to develop my Te."" MBTI isn't about changing who you are. It's just about putting a finger on who you are, and it's honestly considered pretty dodgy, scientifically speaking. A big percentage of the time it totally doesn't work. I'm not saying it's not useful, I'm just saying don't worry too much about developing certain parts. Just be happy with who you are, and find what you love. It's not any more complicated than that."

You have to learn to live a practical life within an idealistic worldview.  For me (in the sense of education and career, which is the main topic of your post), this meant finding a career I am truly passionate about that also pays the bills.  I had to figure out what end-goal I was truly passionate about (and be able to articulate precisely why) in order to have the discipline and commitment to get there.  Because getting there is shitty sometimes.  Sometimes the crap you have to learn is boring as hell and your professors are dick-heads.  But then you can remind yourself of why you are doing this and push through it.    And once you get into said career, you may have to work shit hours, your boss could be a dickhead, your colleagues could be game-playing idiots, and your clients scum of the earth trash.  But if you are truly passionate about what you do, if you can go home most days feeling like you made a small difference in the world, if you can pay your bills and support a modest lifestyle, you will be mostly content.    Feeling like you're making a (small) difference in the world I think is an important thing for many INFPs.  That's why careers in teaching, healthcare/medicine, counselling, etc, are popular among INFPs.    Just a few thoughts."

infp,3d385a,smajda85,9,Mon Jul 13 04:08:01 2015 UTC,"INFPs like people! INFPs definitely like hanging out with their friends, we just get drained easily. ENFPs are likely to be the last ones at the party whereas INFPs need to check out earlier. ENFPs tend to not judge situations enough (get into bad situations/hang with bad people more often because of low Si) whereas INFPs tend to be more choosy about people and situations. ENFPs are generally higher energy and more easily distracted--they can often bounce around between interests and friend groups whereas INFPs tend to focus their energy more singularly. ENFPs tend to have wide groups of friends whereas INFPs are more likely to have a few close ones.  perhaps these threads on the matter will be helpful: https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/2zevws/infp_or_enfp/  https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/21hv2s/enfp_vs_infp_the_on_going_battle/  https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/2v4yc0/is_being_mistyped_as_infp_common/"

Especially with close friends, we love digging deep with them, getting under the surface and finding answers. I think this varies a lot between INFPs, but I also like meeting new people, however, I quickly judge how much of my energy I will expend on them depending on how I see their view of the world or if they have something interesting to come up with."

infp,3d385a,westofthe5th,3,Tue Jul 14 01:51:47 2015 UTC,"OMG, yes.  Wow.  So common: ""I like being around people, but they're not interested in what I'm interested in"".  That sums up the INFP experience pretty well.  Regarding I vs. E: don't forget that these personality characteristics are not mutually exclusive binaries.  They are on a continuum.  Like:  E----------------------------------------------------------------I  Or  J-----------------------------------------------------------------P  And you are somewhere in between those two points.  Neither fully I or fully E (or fully J or fully P), but closer to one or the other, or possibly right smack in the middle of the continuum.  You sound like such an amazing and creative person!  It's possible your friends might be a little intimidated by that.  Remember that you're going to connect with different people in different ways.  You'll have some friends you eat out and small talk with.  Eventually you will find other friends that you can be creative with.  Whatever you do, don't start closing down your social circle and isolating yourself (that's a mistake I made).  You need to keep the network going, even if your people are interested in different things than you.  The social network will help you to eventually connect with people you have more in common with and can be creative with.  In the mean time, try to marginally push your social group's horizons in a direction you can be happy with.  Nothing too big like an art exhibit (doubt they'll go for that), but try a different place to eat (you pick something-- maybe something ethnic and different!) or get them to go to a movie or concert so that they're engaging with the arts in a way that's not too ""out there""."
infp,3d385a,westofthe5th,2,Mon Jul 13 18:55:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the very positive response. There's some stuff in there I needed to hear. Specifically on not closing down my social circle because that's what I want to do instinctively.  I should clarify, my friends really appreciate me and I've had my closest friends for almost over a decade. I think it stinks because as we grow older, they're married and some with children. Their time is more limited and I see myself starving for hanging out as we used to. (most of my friends hung out with me one on one over the years, but now I see some of them mostly in get-together kind of settings where I am practically useless in interacting/enjoying myself.)  It stinks because I am a very ""cheap date"" lol. I like sitting around, talking about abstract things, and I am a super picky eater. I'd rather go to pizza hut than a hibachi. I'd rather watch a concert on youtube than go out to see one. It stinks because the things I enjoy socializing with (video games, walking the woods, sharing and discussing creative things) aren't enjoyed in big groups, so when I do actually see my friends it's in settings where that kind of stuff can't be enjoyed. Just it's more like (let's BBQ outdoors and put on a baseball game and eat greasy food and talk about our kids and jobs). Not that I am not concerned with their well being, it's just that it never moves on to other things.  So the dilemma is that time is more limited for a lot of my older friends, so there's less priority for ""I'm just gonna hang out with this friend"" versus ""oh I'd rather go to a BBQ.""  Ultimate good thing though - I've been with my INFJ girlfriend for over 1.5 years and she is super considerate of doing things I like (and she enjoys them too) and I make sure to do things for her too. (we like going to quiet parks, movies alone, reading together, going to pizza hut here and there lol). I just have a hard time because she is able to handle ""generic social hang outs"" more than I do so I feel really restless when her circle of friends wants to do stuff that could include me. She is very considerate when I say ""I kind of wanna stay in"" and gives me my personal space instead of going to certain things. And she appreciates my artistic drive too.   So I honestly shouldn't complain too much, but I do miss a lot of how much I got to see my old friends.  btw, I think I'm more of an ENFP that needs to temper my self confidence/introverted feeling concerning myself. I have tons of people that love me and appreciate me in my life, just my inner-world is always mean towards itself. I am better at letting my needs known than I used to be/giving myself respect, but I think I need to be better about letting others know what I need without being a temperamental princess about it lol.  Thanks for listening!"

And that's perfectly okay. I don't want to play therapist and say things like 'life is all happy little trees' or anything, because I don't know your life's circumstances. That's your universe, your life, have at it as you will.  There are no 'losers' in this situation, no 'failures', no 'incorrect lifestyles' as you write about. They merely are or are not, and that should be appreciated; watching TV, drawing, office jobs, anything- it all deserves to be respected. And no, just because they are not respecting your lifestyle does not give you the right to disrespect theirs. They are their own universe, and you are your own.  INFPs, I think, should stand in defense of that, if anything at all. I hope your summer gets better."

infp,3d3fnh,westofthe5th,2,Mon Jul 13 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"You are not a loser.  You have some amazing goals!  I think that practicing some self-care will help you to feel better about yourself, to set some micro-goals for the summer that help you to work toward your big goals, and to eventually reach those end goals.    I think INFPs are particularly sensitive to having their circadian rhythms thrown off kilter, which happens naturally as the seasons fluctuate, and unnaturally when our routines change (such as being out of school for the summer).  So this means that we have to be particularly disciplined in maintaining our body's schedule in the face of these outer fluctuations.  That means eating and sleeping on a regular schedule.  It's amazing how much better I feel about myself and my life when I am careful to maintain a schedule.    So little-by-little.  Set some alarms for yourself: bedtime alarm, wake-up alarm, meal alarms.  And stick to them.  I guarantee that after a week, you'll feel physically better and be able to think more clearly about the higher goals that you have.  Boredom is the enemy.  I find I think more clearly and focus better about the things that are important to me when my mind is occupied by mundane things for a portion of every day.  This might mean getting some pissy little part time job for the next few months.  That would serve several purposes in your life: shut your parents up because you are looking productive, keep you on a schedule which will help you feel better, encourage you to place higher value your time off so that you focus on the truly important things during this time, make a little money (remember you are going to have to have some way to support yourself until your actual career takes off.  Sucky but true.)  I'm sorry that most of the world views us as weirdos because we haven't drunk the kool-aide of mediocre office jobs and 2.4 kids with a house in the 'burbs.  But we have a different passion within ourselves than most of the world, and we also have to find the determination within ourselves to disregard all the nay-sayers.  The determination part is practical habits that help us to achieve our goals, and the discipline to stick to those habits.    Take care."

Sometimes I get so caught up in the idea of someone and can be stupidly in love with them in a short time even if they're a horrible person and I just have to go back and listen to it and just remind myself 'You set on me, but you are not the sun'.

Be more present, like, does it feel good hanging out with him right now? Then do it. Do you enjoy having a conversation with him right now? Then keep having it. You can't really hang out with him because you have this vision about you and him in the distant future or because you think it will work out well over time etc etc. The only thing you can rely on is how it feels right now.      Edit: for me it has worked that way because it pushes all the expectations aside.

Honestly, it just sounds like he's telling you that you can if you want to but he doesn't want you to feel obligated. So yes you're overthinking it and I can completely understand how easy it is to do that. I try to just remember people don't have a script to follow and not to read into it too much. Imagine how boring things would be if someone always said something you wanted them to/expected them to. Just fake it till you make it and try not to read into minor things like that. Maybe be senses you are and it annoys him and you're hypersensitive enough to realize. But I would bet money he actually IS tired and you make it about you versus him being tired and then convince yourself he's annoyed with you. I've been there.

infp,3d1sp3,stevenmiller706,3,Sun Jul 12 20:48:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you want advice or are just venting, but just in case:  I think our fear of hurting others is stronger than the hurt they actually do feel when we have let them down.  We try to be compassionate by finding ways to put things gently, but end up dragging things out and making things worse for everyone involved.  I've come to find that bluntness can also be a form of compassion.  A guy rejected me a few months ago with a simple, ""That's very sweet, but no.""  He didn't offer me any explanation, and he didn't coddle me with platitudes.  He was just honest.  It hurt like a motherfucker there for about a week, but I never once thought he was a jerk for handling it that way.  More importantly, though, he never treated me any differently afterward.  I have a massive amount of respect for him for that.    Like you, I hate rejection.  I think everyone does.  But I think the rejection we fear isn't simply rejection of our feelings, but a fundamental rejection of us entirely.  Anytime I've confessed to someone, what I've been afraid of isn't that I won't be their girlfriend, but that they'll just throw me away altogether.  That said, whether or not you're acting like a jerk doesn't have so much to do with what you say to reject her, so much as how you interact with her afterwards.  Sounds like yall were just acquaintances, so just keep treating her that way.    tl;dr next time you have to reject someone, just be blunt, but treat them like nothing ever happened."

Sometimes my brain has blanked out and couldn't remember my number and then felt stupid so just said whatever and went on with my day. However, I think that's unlikely in this situation.

I bet if she is INFP and not interested she would be feeling very guilty, especially after giving a fake number. When you said you like her dress, she probably ran away from the negative feelings she got (guilt) and the pressure, INFPs tend to run away from bad feelings.  If she did like you, she wouldn't put up a wall like that fake number. When they like you, girls will make it easy. I'm trying to see it from the perspective that she likes you and I'm pulling blanks, there is a chance that she accidentally input a wrong number and that she is very shy, so it couldn't hurt to ask if that's the case right?"

infp,3d0gkw,captain_cookiepants,5,Sun Jul 12 13:38:16 2015 UTC,Its true. It seems like friendships are always based on what we can offer to the other person. Its easy to be friendly and be the listener for someone else. Its probably the easiest and most natural state we can offer someone else.  I think baby steps are in order as far as sharing more thoughtful parts of ourselves that arent so manufactured or cultivated. You dont have to share everything or even the most deep stuff. Be more forthcoming with stuff you may be going through or stress that cant be dealt with so easily on your own.  I know we're men and we are supposed to be stoic and suffer in silence and only show our strong side but I think thats the benefit of same gender relationships. There the ones we should be able to confide in more often and be vulnerable without turning into mush completely or becoming whiney as such.  When we're with a SO or gf we are expected to hold frame much more as no matter what sort of equality we want from a relationship theres always a power dynamic in play.  Take your time and give the person a little more social credit and see if he puts in as much as get takes out.

I have been put on the spot by friends in the way you describe too.  You don't ever need to feel obligated to share anything you don't want with anybody.  You decide that for yourself.  You decide what you want to share and with who.  You decide who is worthy of hearing what.  Completly up to you.  What I do is this: if I decide not to open up to someone who wants to be opened up to, I will sometimes share details with them that irrelevant, but I frame it and disguise it in a way that makes it sound relevant.  Takes a littl thought on your part but that usually shuts them up.  They feel they have been confided in, and you continue to keep important thoughts to yourself.  If they continue to press me.  I tell them straight out that I don't want to talk about it.  If I continue to be pressured, I figure that person is being disrespectful of my privacy, so I pull back from them for awhile."

What do they bring me ? Oh... Nothing... Right ok, time to move on.  It might just be me, but this type of ""poetry"" and random quotes don't really open my eyes to anything. I know it already. I know the world is full of monsters just as it's full of angels. I just choose to see the good in everyone, even the monsters.  ""To the small""... I am not and do not feel small. By the first sentence, I do not relate to this book.  Most anyone ""counts stars"" and ""is inspired"". So, this book would be nothing special or personal to me, as everyone does it too. The author may say that he wrote this for me and only me. But he also says ""Everyone else who reads it, doesn't get it. They may think they get it, but they don't."" Well, what if I'm part of that ""Everyone else"" ? Then this book is definitely not meant for me.  I'm sorry if I've tainted the book for you, OP. That is not my intention.  Simply, I would like you to elaborate more on why you relate to an ""Authorless"" book."

I also think our trusted is earned, and if you've lost it, it might certainly be pretty hard to get it back, whether he forgives you or not, he might never treat you the same.  Thats just my interpretation"

At this point it might be up to him, but I would keep trying. Even if he needs time alone,  I'd really try to keep seeing him alone. Let him know you are really sorry and don't wish to lose him.

We were failing to find anything and he was being really difficult and uncompromising. I also had these issues with him, and my friends thought it would also be better for me not to live with him (to be honest, I do agree now haha). So we unfairly decided to drop him at the last minute. I told him what had been decided, but made a really poor job of it because I was scared and upset. About 2 days later, some people in the group backtracked and blamed it all on me, and fucked him around for a couple days making plans before deciding that we would all stick to the original plan. So it was all a massive mess. Good news is that we all have places to live now, so at least that's sorted!  We're both in different countries at the moment, so he'll have 2-3 months to cool down. I'll see if I can do that when he gets back, thanks a lot!"

The trust would be broken. Trust tends to be a big part, at least for me, in whether I am the cold, apathetic, detached INFP or the bleeding heart, do anything for you, idealistic INFP. The sharp edge he is throwing around mood-wise may subside a bit, but I wouldn't expect to be in his ""inner circle"" so-to-speak anymore."

He wanted a lot of things and wasn't compromising, so it got to the point where we were all stuck. He was the one causing the issues, and he also happened to be the only one in the group who had another option). I feel like he's not admitting he was wrong in any way in all of this when, well, he was (I've taken entire responsibility for this whole situation, and feel extremely guilty. The two of us discussed the housing situation and our friendship, which was constructive, but then the rest of this fuss happened and since, he's been under the impression that i've set him up and am happy about the situation, so is refusing to talk to me.   I do realise a lot of this is about trust, and this is why it's all falling on me, since I was the one closest to him, and the one he trusted most. I'm hoping that when things are a little more civil (and he stops wishing suffering upon me), we can maybe talk it over and get to a stage where things are sort of okay!"

Honestly it sounds like you all need to grow up because if you are old enough to live away from your parents with friends, you should be old enough to have open and civil discussions about that living situation...because this is likely only the start of the issues overall if there isn't going to be honest and open communication.   Nevertheless, if he was being difficult through the entire process and then was wishy washy all while openly not wanting to live with some of the group and is this mad that others (who are affected by those opinions he has) discussed him living with them....and he will hold it against you indefinitely while taking no blame........then he doesn't sound like he is actually being a friend at all?

infp,3cz7nh,AlexMeanberg,3,Sun Jul 12 08:48:21 2015 UTC,Two nights ago I dreamed I woke up in my old house and it was on fire.  I ran outside and everything around me was on fire.  All the places from my childhood were burnt to the ground.  It took a while to recover from that one...  I can't help but think there was some meaning behind it.
infp,3cz7nh,dizzyspells,2,Sun Jul 12 03:41:46 2015 UTC,"I dream vividly every night. Last night, I dreamt that I was held hostage in the central business district of my city and transported to a deserted warehouse full of dead bodies. I was so terrified that this would be the end of my life, that my impact on this earth would be no more.  I also had another dream last night where I had dreamt (dream-ception?) that I witnessed my imaginary SO being hit by a bus because of me as we were crossing the road.   My dreams have been so vivid and strong lately. I wake up feeling like I ran a marathon and physically tired.. Even more tired than when I went to sleep."
infp,3cz7nh,heyvness,2,Sun Jul 12 11:07:44 2015 UTC,"As a child, my dreams were always incredibly detailed, enough to make it into my permanent memory. I actually believed these dreams after waking up, and it was so usual I would have nightmares every other day..  So, I taught myself to wake up from dreams. I can't quite explain how I do it, but in my dreams I simply 'feel' my eyelids and close them together, which has saved me from werewolves countless of times.  Right now I still get these powerful dreams, and they still never fail to make me fully believe in their universe. It helps a lot while I write."
infp,3cz7nh,robfrid,2,Sun Jul 12 23:00:05 2015 UTC,"I rarely dream/remember them (pot use, probably) and if I do they're usually very scattershot, like free association. Every once in a while though something will hit me hard, and it tends to be things that are very sensory and emotional.  After quitting smoking I dreamt someone offered and I took a drag despite knowing I didn't want it, like I was afraid to say no. I could taste it in my mouth and in my lungs even after I woke up in a panic. Took me a bit to realize I was in bed sleeping and there was no way it actually happened.  But the worst is when I dream about lost loves, where I swear we were just looking into each other's eyes again like some kind of miracle, smiling like old times, I smell her smell again and feel overwhelming joy, and all the thoughts and feelings I ever had come flooding back, and then the illusion vanishes and I wake up alone."

As i walked down my hall to my bedroom in my home office just a few feet from my bedroom was a man saying ""oh look a stranger in your house!"" Im honestly having waves of goosebumps as I'm writing this it was very intense. This man with a red shirt, a pony tail, and wide eyes quickly stands up and pull out a knife. I quickly run to my room and as i turn around he lunges his knife at me and i wake up. When i woke up i couldn't help but think about how quickly the dream had played out. I know i had dreamed other things before that incident but i couldn't stop thinking about it. I couldn't stop thinking about it and was scared to go back to sleep with that man still on my mind."

One was about me adopting a giant horned beetle, as big as my forearm ; he was my pet and followed me around. I remember he was quite smart and clearly had emotions ; I miss him every now and then, no matter how silly that sounds.  Just this night, I dreamed I met a new guy. He had a Sharpei, my favorite dog. Everything about this guy was oddly appealing, I was totally falling madly in love with him, and so was he with me! I remember thinking ""Well, that's too bad for my current boyfriend, I don't see the point of carrying on my relationship with him now"", only to wake up moments later to realize it was just a dream... The said boyfriend was sleeping at my place, so I proceed to spoon him with very mixed emotions. Still feeling bad I even dreamed of that in the first place, it was ridiculously vivid."

Last night I had one so bad I thought my heart was going to beat its way out of my chest when I woke up. I feel pain in my dreams, too; I don't know if that's normal. They usually occur when I've been in a bad place for a while. I don't get a lot when things have been well. They're always weird, though. I've only had a couple ever that I could count as good.  I also have difficulty differentiated between dreams and memories at times. It’s probably due to a lack of mindfulness"

A lot of people mistype between INFJ and INFP because the types appear so similar on the surface.  We might be similar to ISFP too... the ""sensitive artist"" types haha. They are also Fi-dom, though they use Ni instead of Ne. And although not similar, I personally love and get along with ISFJs really well (supposedly INFPs are ISFJ benefactors)."

infp,3d05x9,thats_ridiculous,10,Sun Jul 12 16:29:12 2015 UTC,"mmm it's the content of what's said as well as the grammar and syntax.  INTPs are domTi-Ne so they're incredibly focused on precision in everything: thought, speech, writing, etc. their sentences tend to be complex, precise little systems.  i hope no one takes offense, but INFP writing tends to be grammatically sloppier because it's more about the intention behind it.  content-wise, you'll see a lot of the people whine about being sad and just generally more emo-ish things that true INTPs (even if they're depressed) don't really phrase that way.   and you'll see people say 'i have very strong Fi for an INTP!' well... that probably means you're INFP because INTPs have Fi 8th in their stack... stuff like that."

Maybe you can nudge her toward regular counseling, beyond the grief counseling.  It's a sticky situation, but somehow get across to her that you care, but can't handle all of her ""issues"" (insert better word here), that it's not healthy for you right now, and that she should see a professional.

However, I got a job as a greenskeeper on a golf course about 6 months ago, and now have to be at work at 4:30am.  This means I get to watch the sunrise every morning, among beautiful oak trees, lakes, perfectly manicured fairways, grassy hills, and all with no light pollution ruining anything at all. Ah:D The feeling watching that sunrise is more stimulating than my morning cup of coffee for sure!  The second best time of the day is the sunset, because I'm usually outside playing with my dogs, the air is cooling down, my family is winding down, and all the work for the day has already been completed so there's only good things to look forward to.

Friend: I'd invite them along to something personally; I enjoy hanging out with them on a casual basis.  Good friend: These are the people I've grown to trust enough that I'd lend them $20 fairly confident I'd get it back when they next got paid.

infp,3cx3o3,chubbyurma,2,Sat Jul 11 19:06:29 2015 UTC,I know what you mean. Friend is someone that I can see in multiple facets and I share at least some personal stuff with and some commonality.   Theres a lot of people whom I only see through playing sports or going to school. I can have a nice time or chat with them but that doesnt really make us friends and more like good acquaintances.  Level of perceived closeness usually signifies if I talk about them as a friend. Yes I think there is the basic friend that you might go and see every now and then. Theres the good friends that you go and see quite often and are usually part of your social circle more. Then there are 2-3 people many would call there best friends at least in wider circles that have my highest level of trust and I would call them when I'm in a jam.
infp,3cx3o3,ChimeraCheree,2,Sat Jul 11 16:19:05 2015 UTC,I am annoyed with some peoples thoughts of  friends or having hundreds or thousands of Facebook Friends. I don't think you can actively maintain a real friendship with more than a handful of people at a time.  Acquaintances/Work Acquaintances -  People you are social with and occasionally go out with socially. If someone quits/leaves job and you generally no longer have contact.  Friends - People you hang out with at their house or yours and socially. People you will help you move or you help them move and maintain an active connection with.  The Best Friend analogy typically involves helping or being helped with a dead body situation.  Which is both ridiculous and valid in the point that someone would go to such great lengths for someone else. This is a person who knows your deepest secrets or knows you so well they will know how you will react to something as if it was happening to themselves.
infp,3cx3o3,tinybadger,2,Sat Jul 11 17:35:59 2015 UTC,"I wish it were something more precise but looking back on my history, I usually reach a point that I look at the person I've taken the initiative to interact with the most, realise that I sort of 'love' them, if you will, and mentally go over all the things they've done for me when they didn't have to. Sappy, I know, and neither sequentially logic or arguably sound judgement of reality, but I suppose so is every foundation of INFP loyalty. Nevertheless, it's always a highly-selective process, probably because I err on cynicism at the start of most relationships more often than not.  Anybody with whom I haven't connected with for more than five minutes is effectively an acquaintance, some more than others, usually depending of how interesting, useful or attractive they are. Yes, I realise that sounds awfully superficial and I'm fine with that. I hold to no more illusions of being fucking Mother Theresa."

Friendly interactions are interactions that result in a net positive emotional feeling after the interaction has ended.  I do have different levels of friendship but I don't have a word for them. I have intimate friends with whom I have a fundamental understanding of emotional state, and with whom I'm emotionally compatible. These are my warmest friendships.  I have less intimate friends with whom I can usually become disillusioned when they act in certain ways, or express certain emotions like anger."

The feelings and sensations run deep and have such great variance it's astounding. One moment I am filled with the euphoria and glory of a king, crushing his enemies under foot and the next I'm being crushed by waves of helpless despair, reasoning abandoning everything I know to go live in the woods or something on account of something silly as a heated conversation I had. I feel as though this sensitivity is where the stereotype of INFPs being emotional little crybabies came from, but, I chose to embrace that, as a little cry baby. These powerful emotions are the fuel to my fire in life."
infp,3cvwd4,Traiectensium,5,Sat Jul 11 07:34:17 2015 UTC,"Cool.  Yep.  Me too.  My non-scientific and not-research based hypothesis is that a majority of INFPs are also HSP.    If you are familiar with Aron's research, she also has done a fair bit of work on high sensation-seekers, which are not actually opposite or exclusive of highly sensitives.  It is possible to be both highly sensitive and high sensation-seeking.  Do you have a good sense of where you fit on the sensation-seeker scale?"

infp,3cvojx,dependenceday,13,Sat Jul 11 04:05:34 2015 UTC,"Hahaha.... Yeah, no you really just don't ""get it."" But he doesn't really ""get"" you either. There aren't any objective facts to back up his beliefs; he IS basing them on what he's seen and observed, but it's hard to articulate any of it. It's kinda like how your gut feelings about certain patterns are rarely wrong - a person you meet will rub you the wrong way, you won't know WHY, but then they'll get arrested for breaking & entering weeks later. That kind of thing. Humans have a TON of observational abilities and the ability to evaluate situations with multiple variables to an absolutely stunning degree, but we can't really pinpoint what all those variables are or what they mean individually.  As INFPs, our view of the world is based more on those subtextual observations plus our dreams of how great things COULD be.  Now, his apparent inability to realize that some people see things differently, that's probably a stubbornness unique to him - that's not a specifically INFP thing. In fact many of us here are quite empathetic, or try really hard to be. I'm fascinated by the idea of people seeing things differently - it does cause problems, but I'm more interested in learning why they assumed or believed what they did, and less in being ""right.""  One of my best friends is an INTJ - and he's who got me into the jungian types - and he and I get along really well, but I could never imagine dating him because he just... well he just sees things differently! I'll tell him I feel a certain way, and he'll assume I feel that way for one reason, when I really feel that way for an entirely different reason. Same starting point, same destination, TOTALLY different path.  To summarize, really... INFP's base their thoughts and actions on their gut feelings, subtext, intuition, and pattern recognition on a very subconscious level; INTJ's, by contrast, base their thoughts and actions on hard, observable data on a more macro level - stuff you can perceive with the naked eye, measurements that can be taken, reality as it truly is now as opposed to where it might go someday.  Neither of you is wrong, but you're seeing different parts of reality. Like you're seeing the round shape of the ball of yarn, and he's feeling the squshiness of it. You see it as a tool for creating clothing that will keep people warm; he sees it as something a cat can play with while his grandma tries to knit a cozy, pretty security blanket. You see it as ""red,"" he'll see it as ""beautiful."" All truths, all very very different.  EDIT: This right here, this sums it up great. Typing that last paragraph reminded me of this song from Sesame Street that my daughter liked when she was little. You're Bert, he's Ernie. :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4fq3l5-TsA"
infp,3cvojx,zer0buscus,6,Sat Jul 11 04:38:32 2015 UTC,"After pondering this post, I came to a conclusion.  It's not that he can't explain himself that bothers me, it's that he sometimes won't even try. It's like he's offended that I would even ask him to back up his statements. How dare I! Haha that sort of thing. Then I wondered why that is. And I remembered that a lot of people have told me my voice is naturally challenging. I'll ask ""Can you pass the milk?"" and the other person will hear ""I dare you to pass that milk.""   INFPs are sensitive about their ideals, right? Maybe he feels like I don't believe him or I'm challenging him, when really I just think he's very intelligent and want to see him develop his Te. There's a lot of potential there.  Perhaps it's just a fundamental difference in why we have discussions. He discusses to share his thoughts/feelings and isn't looking to be swayed, I discuss to help myself learn and take the feelings out of the equation.   I think I may have answered my own question, but your post helped me get there, so thanks.  Haha and I relate to that video, I think I'll show it to him."
infp,3cvojx,Jeniluna,6,Sat Jul 11 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"I am an INFP and I have trouble with the exact same thing as you do. I also like to exchange different viewpoints with others, but people often get upset with me or shut down because my voice gets too harsh (I have heard it called debatey). I have been trying to consciously speak in a soft tone and it has definitely reduced conflict between me and my INTP SO.    He discusses to share his thoughts/feelings and isn't looking to be swayed, I discuss to help myself learn and take the feelings out of the equation.   While I often am looking to change my opinion and learn from others in discussion (and this involves being less emotional for me as well), there are definitely times when I need a break from that, whereas my INTP SO kinda never turns that off. I have to tell him explicitly when I am trying to emotionally vent or decompress in conversation, so he knows not to respond with a litany of suggestions for improvement, which can make my feelings seem invalid and stupid when I am stressed. Perhaps you can suggest to your SO that he tell you explicitly when he needs a sympathetic ear?"
infp,3cvojx,zer0buscus,2,Sat Jul 11 08:00:38 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible that he misconstrues your tone as being more challenging than it is. INTJs can often come across as cold or emotionless to us, and it's COMPLETELY unintentional.  That other thing you mentioned about the purpose behind conversations is veeeerrrryy likely. Generally this is a divide you can observe between women & men, but obviously that's personality-dependent (women are more likely to be INFx, men are more likely to be IxTJ)... generally one personality talks just to share feelings; the other talks in order to probe for help or advice in order to fix problems. This is right in line with those respective personalities' reasons for doing ANYTHING, so it makes sense for talking to just be another one of those things.  Another possibility is that he's tried to explain how his mind works to so many people so many times to no avail, and he's just sick of trying. I can definitely relate to that, too."
infp,3cvojx,westofthe5th,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:05:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.    Not knowing your SO and only based on your comments, OP, I am guessing that he, like all INFPs, is relying on his intuition a lot more than you do.  Intuition is pretty hard to describe to another, but it's not total BS.  Not always.    ""To summarize, really... INFP's base their thoughts and actions on their gut feelings, subtext, intuition, and pattern recognition on a very subconscious level; INTJ's, by contrast, base their thoughts and actions on hard, observable data on a more macro level - stuff you can perceive with the naked eye, measurements that can be taken, reality as it truly is now as opposed to where it might go someday.""

infp,3cvojx,ericwilldiesoon,2,Sat Jul 11 05:14:20 2015 UTC,"I'm very future-oriented, like most INTJs, and view hard facts as more of a backup for my thoughts. They're like tools and reassurance, but they're not the basis of for my thoughts and actions. My vision of the future is my basis for that.  I really do know what it's like to not be able to describe something. A lot of INTJs struggle with Ni saying ""I just know this will happen"" and then Te saying ""No, that's not enough, you need facts."" So I can relate to that bit. However, I think being able to articulate your thoughts is a useful skill. Which is why I like having discussions with him like this, it helps me learn to do that.  I'm getting off on a tangent here, but perhaps if I gained a better understanding of Ne I'll be able to see his side of the coin.   More than anything, I find that way of thinking interesting because it's so totally foreign to me."

I feel as though it's a tragedy that some INFPs are doomed to. We get so caught up in ourselves that nobody else could ever hope to understand. I find the most random things interesting or from time to time I'll feel the need to give a viewpoint on a very deep subject to my closest friends and I'll rarely get a meaningful reply in the sense of what I was expecting, and I can't help but feel I'm just an annoyance at this point, but I promise you, Your boyfriend doesn't do what he does with malicious intent.

But I came to r/INFP for help because I know it's easier to articulate one's explanation on the internet. And I wasn't disappointed, most of this stuff is being bookmarked because it's very helpful.   PS your second paragraph stood out to me, I definitely don't want him to feel like he's an annoyance. Maybe I should stay quiet and just let him vent sometimes."
infp,3cvojx,tigerscomeatnight,2,Sat Jul 11 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"Personally, I know I can't really vent on my own. It has to be coaxed, I have to be asked the right questions, etc. and even then it's really taxing to vocalize what's going on with me and I end up getting frustrated With myself.    can I ask you something?

I will never understand the feelings of most other people, that's fine, but I can accept them. Logic doesn't go with emotion, I get that. I would never criticize him for feeling a certain way.  What I want is for him to explain why he thinks a means b, when from my observations, a means c.   After reading these posts though, I understand that it's like we're looking at two completely different sides of the world. Which is probably why he thinks I won't understand."
infp,3cvojx,stevenmiller706,2,Sat Jul 11 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"I think your missing that feelings aren't meant to be ""understood"" in the cold hard light of logic.

If you totally lack empathy then work on cognitive empathy, voice tone ( soothing,  nurturing [you mentioned this was a problem]), eye contact,  body language (soft, reassuring gentle touches).

And he's actually the one person who has really made me feel anything. Sometimes I hate that, haha.  A big problem seems to be that he will insert emotion into a conversation where, from my perspective, it doesn't really have any place. It seems as if he could say ""2 + 2 = 4"" and if I ask him to explain why he thinks that, he'll just tell me I don't understand. That's an exaggeration of course but I'm left thinking.... how did we even get here? Why are you even upset?  That kind of thing."

I often think it would be so much easier to skip ahead and ""know"" what future me wants to do with her life and how it will all pan out. Or have someone tell me: ""hey knitterz, xyz career/lifestyle is exactly what you will love and need, this is your future!""  In reality though, I think I will have more stories to tell later on in my life if I make beauty out of the daily struggle to figure things out. Try different things, go different places, wander around aimlessly in life and you will end up with some pretty cool memories. Yes, it sucks on a level because everyone else around us just jumps into school, career, family etc and we feel like we can't get our shit together long enough to get through the week sometimes.   I have been working really hard lately to embrace my quirks and realize that I don't have to know everything yet. I still get discouraged at times, but then I come on here and see that I am not alone and that my inability to tie myself to one singular future right now is not me being lazy or failing at anything, it's just my way of discovering my path."

infp,3cuqtf,Motivation_Man,6,Fri Jul 10 22:59:17 2015 UTC,i hate to say it but ive done this in the past. i dont want to alarm you but you describing this in such a way seems like a splitting of sorts. Basically taking what you know of a person and twisting it negatively while amplifying it.  I think we all say hurtful things when feel weve been usurped emotionally speaking and basically let our social filters shut down.
infp,3cuqtf,ChimeraCheree,6,Sat Jul 11 00:25:10 2015 UTC,"Um, yes, I do this to the people I am closest to.  All. The. Time.  But then, the people closest to you are the ones who get under your skin the most, aren't they?  Forgive me for drawing a conclusion (or making an assumption, or trying to read between the lines or whatever), but it sounds like the problem isn't that he burned down your houses.  The problem has been building over the past few months that he has been spending more time with his gf and you are feeling your friendship has been a little neglected.  You feel some resentment from that whole situation.  The burnt houses and cockiness are just the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.  No, this does not make you a horrible person.  Sometimes you need to clear the air in order to move forward.  Hopefully you and your friend can do that.  (After I have an outburst that hurts someone, I always find it helpful to go back to that person when I'm calmer and explain how I'm feeling and why calmly, rationally and respectfully.  An apology doesn't hurt either.  A mature person will be understanding enough to work the situation out with you once they realize you lashed out to hurt them only because you are feeling hurt yourself.  But it's up to you if you think the friendship is worth that or not, or if you think your friend will be responsive to that tactic.)  Incidentally, feeling replaced by someone's new SO is also something that sets me off.  So I'd say that's pretty normal.  (I vastly apologize if I have made a totally wrong assumption about your situation or have overstepped)"
infp,3cuqtf,westofthe5th,2,Sat Jul 11 05:47:23 2015 UTC,"Nope. I'm really a genuinely good guy I'd say, when it comes to hurting other people. I only raise my voice sometimes when arguing and that is all. I'd never say things like that just to hurt.   Moreover, I'm actually the target of negative thoughts. Things like ""your family is fucking messy"" didnt hurt me the last time I heard it. I live with my mom now that my parents divorced and yes we are a bit dysfunctional. A few days ago someone over the Internet told me to kill myself.  Surprisingly for an online game, it was the first time I heard that... Online.   Remember to be nice. If he's an asshole just kick him out of the game and go on. Unless saying bad things comfort you and I doubt it, there's no reason to do it and it helps nobody."
infp,3cuqtf,Ryzetafari,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:11:13 2015 UTC,It wasn't simply the minecraft. I have the types of blowups you describe. What were you thinking about when your houses started burning?  When was the last time somebody yelled at you and what were they trying to say? I'm sure your outburst didn't just come from nowhere.    It's also worth noting that I never have success in harboring negative ideas about a friend.  My best advice is to be aware of your harsh feelings and share them in a setting that you have some control over.  Ideallt you should have confronted your best friend earlier about the conflicts you're having.
infp,3cuqtf,googajub,2,Sat Jul 11 00:56:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely wasn't just the Minecraft. The guy's been getting on my nerves for ages, and when the houses burned down, as petty as it is, I was pissed off that I'd given him a chance to let people get to know him instead of them thinking he's a dick, when in the end he just threw it back in my face. I really should have confronted him earlier, but it didn't even seem like a big deal to me. I didn't think he was so annoying that something had to be done about it. It was bearable, but for some reason I just snapped at him. I don't even know where it came from at all, it was awful."

I'm happy to say that I'm learning to snap out of it through the use of mindfulness meditation. Once you learn that all you have is the present moment and that you have spent all your time letting your mind race about the future and the past, you can see for reality as it is, learn to accept it, and have happiness in this moment. It doesn't even require these golden moments with others! Best of luck to you in your journey."
infp,3cs7cy,quentin_tortellini,3,Fri Jul 10 10:09:58 2015 UTC,A lot of MBTI is based on what you decide and not tests. The best advice I had beyond taking multiple tests was to read the most detailed descriptions of every type and choose the one I related to the most. One test claimed I was literally every single letter differently than I ultimately was.
infp,3cs7cy,Ray_adverb12,2,Fri Jul 10 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"This is what I got on a recent functions test I took. It said that I'm most likely in ENFP based off my results. This was kind of a relief to me, because the ENFP's preoccupation with creativity and change really resonates with the core of my personality, whereas the descriptions of INFP's being preoccupied with morality as well as ""right and wrong"" never crosses my mind. I know that I might be misunderstanding both types, but my point is that I haven't really identified with the essence of an INFP the way I identify with the ENFP's.   So based off this test (I know it's just one test and I should take it with a grain of salt), I tend to use these cognitive functions the most. And the listed descriptions really ring a bell with me because they seem to describe my thought process on a daily basis. But I know that the ENFP function stack doesn't look like this. They have Te, when I know that I'm VERY weak in that area. I just started looking into the cognitive functions a few days ago, so I'm not completely sure what to think. Is it possible to be made up of functions that don't completely adhere to any personality type? But that's assuming that this test guessed my type based off of 48 vague questions. I'm not about to rely on the results of an online test, but I can't rely on my knowledge when it comes to this, because I don't know all there is to know about cognitive functions. I really have no clue, I'm beginning to think that I'm just a really reserved ENFP.  All I know for certain is that I was extremely happy to get that Ne as my primary function. That's the function that makes me proud of being myself, and it's the function that I think makes life fun and exciting. I'm glad I got it on my arsenal, and I can't wait to build it up even more.   On the other hand- I know that Fi is the INFP's primary function, but even though I think it's a beautiful way of perceiving life, I can't really think of any concrete examples of using it lately. I say this because I relate to so many aspects of being an INFP, but why not its primary cognitive function? I'm so confused about this. But there's a reason I'm posting this in /r/INFP, because part of me still isn't convinced that I'm one of those ENFP energy balls. I seem to be an ENFP on the inside, but behaviorally, I tend to lean on INFP mode. I really don't know. It's 3:37, so please excuse the messy rambling. Thanks, all."
infp,3cs7cy,Poropopper,5,Fri Jul 10 10:38:55 2015 UTC,"enfp vs infp - read through this carefully and think about how you have acted in the past in response to very specific situations naturally. The thing that makes NFs hard to type is their idealism, an INFP might believe that it is 'right' to act extraverted and become more extraverted in an attempt to better themselves and reach their ideal. You are doing this now by idealizing yourself as an Ne, and now you change yourself to reflect what you believe. You will find what type you truly are during a calmer period between the times that you are changing yourself and trying to live up to your ideals."

And if you have a bit of time, you might be interested in reading these also: ENFP and  INFP  So what give you are some posts about tertiary and inferior functions (Si and Te), they explain how differently they work for INFP and ENFP. I hope this will help you to get a deeper insight about functions, and that will help you determine your type."

Find someone who you can talk to, who can be there and listen until you can sort out those messy emotional threads into something easier to manage. And keep talking about it. Be open and vulnerable if you have someone trustworthy.  Also, get out and do something, see something new.

infp,3cs3cr,ghostopolis,2,Fri Jul 10 14:17:29 2015 UTC,"I use a meditation from Thich Nhat Hanh. He has a whole book on dealing with anger and extreme emotions entitled Taming the Tiger Within: Meditations on Transforming Difficult Emotions. The basic idea when dealing with anger is to first notice the anger. Then stop what you are doing immediately, and calm your body through deep breathing. Take a walk if you can to help release the energy. When you are physically calm you mind starts to calm down as well. Only when you are completely calm and present do you want to even begin to deal with whatever the trigger was. It doesn't have to be a big production, and could take anywhere from seconds to days depending on how much emotion is going on. It is best to try it with small things first, but if big things come up do what you can. It is a learned skill and a practice. It does work. I highly recommend the book."

The key here is to remain optimistic and cheerful in the company of others. Not being fake by any means, just focusing on how good I feel when I'm being good or in the presence of humans that I find eternally magical and funny and interesting. And then when I'm by myself, fall apart quietly. Cry a lot. On rare occasions, maybe allow myself to fall apart in front of my husband who is the only person who will see me that way because I hate feeling like I'm being a nuisance/burden to the people who matter to me. And then the feelings pass, it's back to normal. Well, as close to normal as INFP's get. Haha."

Producing something of beauty can ease pain, particularly existential pain. Even if you think whatever you create is horrible at the time, save it--I often find something that I remember as horrible in a depressive mood to be very beautiful to me later, something I try to remember in my next dark mood. As is the case with many writers, I find that the acuteness of my emotions when in pain makes my command of artistry more striking and vivid in its rawness."
infp,3cs3cr,Jeniluna,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:27:14 2015 UTC,"Some methods I've used in the past: - Find music that helps and never turn it off - Write songs about how I feel - Write autobiographically - Cry to myself late at night - Sit in cafe's by myself writing letters to people telling them how I feel, and then keep them for myself. - Take a sleepless night (or sleep only like, two hours), it's weird but really helps. - Drop out of University wait what…  I usually won't discuss how I've been feeling to others until I've managed to move on enough to not feel so vulnerable about it. Then again I am a guy and don't really want to break down into tears in front of people. For female INFPs I would imagine that it would be easier to show that vulnerability around (really) close friends, and therefore bypass the immediate need for most of the methods stated above. I could well be wrong though… it may just mean that when you do open up in time, you reveal a little bit more."

The honest solution for myself, medical conditions aside, was to wake up early and go to bed early at the same time every night and spend as much time outside as you possibly can.  Much easier said than done when you're in a rut, I know.  Make a reason to get up early, followed by relatively filled days, so that you're too tired to stay awake at night.  Have a very specific morning ritual so that you habitually snap into action the moment you wake up. Then learn to like it as your body can start functioning properly again :)  Useful tip — the melatonin in our bodies interacts with the presence or absence of sunlight to the point where humans are biologically inclined to sleep in the dark and be awake in the light. Sleeping through the day while you're awake at night is a bit of a vicious cycle in which the sleep that you do get leaves you tired and groggy, which makes you sleep through more of the day.  Anyway, I hope something of that was helpful to you."

infp,3crs7t,TrantaLocked,2,Fri Jul 10 06:36:20 2015 UTC,"What vocalists do you have in mind, I think I need some examples? First one that springs to my mind is Florence and the machine, very likely Fi, listening to her music sometimes I feel like I am dragged into a sad, dark and beautiful world, others it's more like a grand and bittersweet anthem. I think her music has a very large range of emotion, it's like a landscape and an expression of her inner-self.  Fi is about expressing intrinsic feeling. I believe Fe is about expressing the feeling of everyone, they are more likely to write a song that resonates with the feelings of the social circle they belong to.   Fi users might consider Fe to be shallow. I can't think of a good representative of Fe that people might know right now, perhaps Natasha Bedingfield is a good representative. When I think Fe music, I tend to think more contemporary music. Fe users might be more expressive about feelings in person, but I think when it comes to music Fi is more able to express their inner-self than when in person, much like in writing."

I feel like they have equal emotional range, but very different approaches to music and lyrics."
infp,3crs7t,Thobalt,2,Fri Jul 10 10:49:12 2015 UTC,Fi and fe are our sources of values and aren't strictly tied to emotional experience or expression.
infp,3crs7t,thats_ridiculous,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:36:20 2015 UTC,"So how do your values draw on your Fe? At this point I seem to have a good understanding of what Fi means for me, but I really want to get a better grasp of other functions and how they feel for other types."
infp,3crs7t,Thobalt,2,Fri Jul 10 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile now, so it's short, but fe demands that I understand what's socially and culturally expected of me. My validation comes from other people because my inner structure is amorphous at best. I have my own issues, but handling others' issues is many times easier on me than my own. My personal values have to be expresses, I cannot simply have them.  You may dream your dreams and values, but I must live mine and still heed how and if it is socially acceptable and what that dissonance means for me. I don't just have pierced ears because I want them, for example, it's also a stab at gender norms, my sense of gender and identity, and an expression of self that doesn't sit right with people and displeases my parents. Much of this is parsed through ni and ti first, clearly, but the outside expectations are a huge factor here.  Does that make sense?"
infp,3crs7t,thats_ridiculous,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:11:35 2015 UTC,It does make sense and I appreciate your insight. Would you say it drives you to behave a certain way to get a positive/negative reaction out of people? Or does it just make you externalize things more?
infp,3crs7t,Thobalt,2,Fri Jul 10 18:53:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain how to respond about getting a reaction from people- I'm rather terrified at the idea of getting people to act a certain way. I suppose I do adjust my behavior to be amicable or helpful to different people, but different people call for different social behaviors, y'know? Talking with friends, elders, brothers, strangers, most everyone behaves differently to each group. As far as reactions go- they're given, not gleaned, I suppose. If we dissolve social interactions into action and reaction, I want the reaction to be freely given."
infp,3crs7t,Kafke,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:38:56 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, you've figured out the basic idea of mirror types. I/E for the functions dictate whether or not you extrovert them (meaning show them). Fe are pointed outward, and should seem as such, while Fi is inward.  Same goes for the rest of the functions."

infp,3cq419,zombmu,4,Fri Jul 10 01:21:56 2015 UTC,"I have a facebook that I rarely use, maybe a new profile picture once every year or two? Occasionally I post in some groups I am a part of with close friends or with mutual interests. I started doing this more when work gets slow.  I have a twitter that I use much more often because rather than being full of ""people I've met"" it's full of ""people with mutual interests"" - I don't really make a ton of posts here either, but I participate in conversation on both of them(facebook messenger or just directly tagging someone on twitter)  Edit: originally when graduating high school I had thought social media to be awkward and weird but I've grown to get a fair bit of enjoyment from it. Just be a bit careful, because sites like Facebook especially you're looking at the top 10% of everyone's lives and might find yourself comparing it to your bottom 10%."
infp,3cq419,TheLazyBassist,6,Thu Jul 9 22:15:36 2015 UTC,"Is there really a concept that you need to be on social media in order to do well in relationships? This is the first time I've heard of that. Evaluating your partner based on their online presence is kind of not my thing, so here's at least one vote that says the way you are online is not relevant to dating.  Actually there was one thing that really shocked me about facebook with my ex. I don't use facebook but I have an account without any pictures just to do mandatory facebook stuff with groups of people. My ex wanted to mark us to be in a relationship (just the idea of publishing your private business like that on an online platform is repulsive to me but it doesn't matter too much since I don't use facebook). Anyway, after a while we got into an argument due to something that I was a part of in facebook. I played in a heavy metal band where I composed the songs and it was a nice hobby for us. She on the other hand studies music theory so I thought it was a funny combination, maybe I could ask for some tips every now and then. All of a sudden there's an argument where she says that she has to reconsider being publicly with me because the heavy metal band sounds musically so unprofessional and not up to her standards. She felt like as a professional in music, she shouldn't be associated with people who are so unprofessional in music. My mere hobbies seemed to soil the image of her as a professional (or an upcoming professional at that point). That was really interesting and strange :D. We're no longer together so now she can focus all her energy on being as professional as she likes and I can focus on being happy with what I naturally do which is making music. It was a win-win ending of a relationship :D  EDIT: By the way, here's one of our band's songs in case someone is interested to hear the music that caused all the stir: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHclpYG7S2M  This is the stuff I make these days: https://soundcloud.com/ode-imaginations/no-less-brilliant"

Glad you aren't with her anymore.  Though I can kind of see the part about adding your relationship on Facebook. It has been proven several times that those who don't list their relationship status on Facebook (of those who have a profile) are much more likely to cheat because there will be more opportunities to cheat. Not that you automatically would cheat if you didn't list it, but speaking as a girl that kind of makes sense in my weird brain."

infp,3cq419,TepidTurtle,3,Fri Jul 10 21:31:40 2015 UTC,"Heh, I just created a Facebook account yesterday. I haven't felt the 'need' to have one because it feels so shallow to me. The 'friends' on there are more just people I know. Not that it is a bad thing but it feels weird to me. And the funny thing is that I was terrified of even making an account and adding others, I was afraid that people would find it weird, find me weird and disliked me. Sometimes I don't even know why the hell I do that to myself. The responses have only been positive, inside and outside of Facebook. And the ones outside of Facebook I value so much more. Social media should be used as a tool, (eventhough it is an out-of-shape tool), and should not be used as a 'real life event'. So just post whatever you feel like, and maybe I am an exception but I don't care what someones profile looks like, what photos they have on there (unless the photos are really weird and inappropiate). It is about the person, in real life, not the profile where you could be anyone.  The saying:  ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" holds up quite well here ;p"

infp,3cq7gi,CitiesCorner,5,Thu Jul 9 22:06:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely. And it's also definitely a self-esteem issue, but one that I think INFPs are likely more prone to experience."
infp,3cq7gi,scarlet___begonias,4,Thu Jul 9 22:36:16 2015 UTC,"It's a self-esteem issue. I don't think it's an intrinsic trait of any particular cognitive type, just a symptom of your mental health. I do the same thing, though. I make excuses for other people's bad behavior and ideas even though I would tear myself to pieces for making the same mistakes, simply because I feel that other people must be more competent than me. I never have those ""deep"" conversations people talk about having for fear that I may say something disagreeable or wrong because whatever comes out of my mouth must be disagreeable or wrong."
infp,3cq7gi,KthuluKat,2,Thu Jul 9 22:45:35 2015 UTC,"I actually think it is a typical INFP problem, though not limited to the type. On the brightside, you're not an egocentric jackhole. On the other brightside, it is easy to fix, it just takes experience and practice to develop faith in yourself and to really understand how your own thoughts stack up against others and strive for real balance.  There is a reason why so many people say 'people are stupid', and it's because it helps them to believe in their own superiority, boosting their self esteem and ability to be themselves and drive forward."

infp,3cotnx,Wibei,3,Thu Jul 9 18:35:06 2015 UTC,Its always easier to look inside someone else's window than it is to look out from your own.  I think thats why being a parent in the end is so painful because you want to be in the driver's seat as a result of wanting what's best for them.  Good on you for trying. In the end its hard to go about it this way but I think its better to offer advice or help only when its sought after by the other person.

It came up a lot in conversations between myself and a counselor at college, because she would constantly remind me ""X is free to make their own decisions"" and ""Is Ys happiness YOUR responsibility?""  I had the problem of personally investing my happiness in the happiness of other people.  (To some extent I still do.)  As my one friend told me at some point as we talked about the dangers of a possible relationship, ""So yeah, I know it's a bad idea, and I don't want to end up in a bad position, but if push comes to shove... let me make my own mistakes.""  It's hard, it really really is, but I've noticed that sometimes you can't head off a disaster because even if you recognize it, the person could very well not listen.

For instance being encouraging to others is great and doesn't cost any energy at all as long as you are not invested in the results of the encouragement. It is also a lot of fun.

infp,3cotnx,macjoven,2,Thu Jul 9 22:35:13 2015 UTC,"This isn’t really specific to you, but to this attitude of “saving” people in general.  People don’t need to be rescued; they need to take control of their own lives. If someone is a train wreck, taking on responsibility for them isn’t helping; it’s enabling and reinforcing bad behavior (and setting your rescue effort up for failure). Helping people requires boundaries. It requires that you let them take responsibility for their mistakes instead of handing them a reason to take advantage of you. If you see that someone is taking advantage of you and you don’t pull away and establish some boundaries, you have yourself to blame for the personal fallout you experience. You also can’t account for all the factors that contribute to someone’s behavior. A lot of people have underlying problems that influence their behavior that are way above your head.   You aren’t a hero, you can’t save people. Don’t try. I speak from experience."

Years later, once he had a steady job, I asked him to start paying rent and he flipped out on me. He threatened me physically, and went all ""sour grapes"" saying he shouldn't have to pay to live in such a ""shithole"" that was perfectly fine when it was free.

You can really think long and hard about the pros and cons of your social and family conditioning. There are patterns in your thinking, reactions to people or situations that shape your perception of reality. If you want to change your perception of reality, you have to identify these ""automatic thoughts."" You have to become hypervigilant with those thought patterns. There is nothing wrong with your upbringing in such a way that if you are able to transcend some of the value systems that you were raised in, you will be a richer person for it, and by richer I mean you will be able to look back on your upbringing with passive acceptance, if not love.   edit: misspelling"

For example, how does employing the term ""blue collar... typical consumer"" identify you? And if it doesn't , why do you think you felt the need to identify it here? Also, how does this identity fit with being a ""soul brother""?   I find, as a deeply inquisitive and sensitive type, really taking time to do this sort of internal work is extremely helpful, and makes you feel less like a part of a type of life, and more like an authentic self."

He felt neglected because he would ask how my day is and all I could say is ""good, you?"" I'm not the type to randomly talk about what I had for lunch today or what I worked on at the gym. But that's the way he creates conversation.  I would ask him about some current event and he would simply reply, ""I don't know enough about it."" Wasn't curious enough to look into it, so that was that.  Our conversations turned into a routine ""good morning"" text, mid day, ""how's work"" text, evening ""whatcha doin"" text, and then finally a ""goodnight, I love you"" text.  It got so lonely.

I think the Fi cry-trigger is connected to meaning.  We don't cry right away at sudden losses the way you think we might if you saw us gushing randomly at the end of Moneyball (just me?  Oh.)  And meaning will come.  For me it is either a book/song/movie induced-revelation or the result of alcohol opening me up so that I begin to explore aloud my meandering search for meaning.  Then, 100% of the time, I cry 100% of the time.  Maybe it's that you can't process the meaning of your grandpa's life all at once.  Either way, emotions are out of our control, so there's no use getting bothered about them.  I'd be willing to bet everything, though, that the tears will come accompanied by catharsis and deep gratitude for your grandpa's life and the love you got to share."

I worried about much of the same stuff you're worried about. But see, she had Alzheimer's for several years by then, and it had put a huge strain on my grandpa, who never once complained about taking care of her, but was so delicate and wonderful to her until the very end. But it was time, and on some level I understood that. I did cry for a couple minutes when I hugged my mom, and it was nice to get it out of the system, but it wasn't bottled up or anything. I don't think there's anything wrong with you. Your brain, your feelings, your soul is probably just working through its understanding of the situation as best as possible."

I would also add for where I'm at right now - have a few friends, good coworkers, it's easier to let loose a little more, whereas right after I had moved and just gotten a new job, I was much more withdrawn."
infp,3cmg6h,madcowbomber,4,Thu Jul 9 07:43:43 2015 UTC,"Less introverted and less shy. When I first took the test as a teenager, I had zero points in extroversion and zero in J. Now I'm a lot more ambidextrous, which has been a good goal. I spent my 20s gently pushing my limits and acquiring mastery experiences (going to protests, getting involved in bicycle culture, dating and trying to date, becoming a leader in AmeriCorps).  With neutral people, I can fake it for as long as it takes. With the right people, compatible people who I share values with, I am very extroverted and energized. With the wrong people, faking it is harder but I can pull it off for a little while if I'm not having an otherwise crappy day.  It's important to not pigeonhole yourself because of a silly test. It's important to carve out a safe harbor in your life where you can live in your strengths and refresh your stores, but it's also important to try yourself in unfamiliar seas. This year I'm 35 and it has been another year of living outside my strengths, not unlike my mid-20s. It's been hard, tiring and I need respite, but at the same time, I feel proud, discovered new resilience and realized that I'm ready to push for the next stage in my life, whatever that may be."

I'll often say off the wall stuff, which makes my wife laugh, and often makes our server at a restaurant, or person behind the counter, or whoever we're interacting with laugh as well. I still hate parties and large groups of people who's only reason for existing is to be in the group. I don't know... I probably would mortify my high school self."
infp,3cmg6h,Theopholus,4,Thu Jul 9 14:43:31 2015 UTC,"If you asked me this a few years ago, I would have said that I'm more sociable than I used to be. But I've realised that was because I chose a career path which surrounded me with like minded people (creative industry). I also lived in a share house, so although I did need my alone time, there were constantly people around and stuff happening, so I did hang out with people a lot.    Fast forward to today, and I've realised that no, I'm just as shy as I was in high school. I'm not working in my old career anymore, and I'm in a workplace with a mixed group of people, all with different interests (although most are very outgoing and sociable). So to get to the point, since I'm around a lot of 'normal' people, I've just sort of reverted back to being really withdrawn. I can easily go a whole work day without saying a word to anyone. Sometimes I'm irritated with just how silent I can be, but 95% of what people talk about is just TV-static to my ears, so I just cant muster the energy to join in. On the odd occasion when I do actually want to join in, since I've been silent for so long, it just seems like it would be weird to suddenly be all chatty out of nowhere, so that sort of stops me. I also live in a place with just me and my girlfriend, so I don't interact with other people at home besides her, so maybe that has something to do with it too.  It's weird, thinking I've become more social, but then realising that its just an illusion based around the fact that I surrounded myself with more like minded people.  That's just work though. I have a group of friends who I'm comfortable with, with whom I feel free to be my silly self. Get a few drinks in me and onto a topic I'm passionate about, and you'd have no idea that I'm shy at all.  (I've basically equated shyness & introversion, I know there's a difference, but as I'm both I've used them interchangeably)"

At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning.

My other closest friend moved away recently so I was left alone with him and he filled the void. We spent many nights playing games on his basement or going out with other friends... Then I heard from a third friend who we also used to meet with a lot something about my friend... Suddenly it hit me. I didnt feel ""close"" to him. He had secrets. Its not that the secrets bothered me at all, its just a let down from knowing that you love and need someone so very much, and it turns out you arent even half important to him as he is to you. This other guy was much more important.  Among other things, I also felt very different in habits. Im an introverted indoors guy, they all love parties and doing drugs and going to clubs.

infp,3clwi7,le-chacal,5,Wed Jul 8 23:34:25 2015 UTC,"I don't really know my parents or my sister at their core. I understand their general beliefs and morals and that they love me, but I don't know about their innermost desires and dreams. I would love to discuss my dreams with them but its like if I did they would start pushing me to suddenly change. I don't like feeling pushed. I like feeling like I'm pulling myself into change for my own improvement. My family has the power to make me bend a little but they don't motivate me to change into what I would ideally become: which is eventually to have a family of my own and have a career I actually enjoy or a career that can pay for a quality of life that could support my lines of interest and probable family haha. Anyway, my family doesn't seem comfortable opening our box of feelings. It's not that it would be taken negatively, it's just that we don't. I went on a bike ride through our neighborhood with them and I told them some snippets of memories I had about about some spots. Like where I threw a board at some girl during a dirt clod war at a construction site 15 years ago as a child. It's like they couldn't believe a nice person could be a little shit as kid, especially their kid. But that is an example of story I don't even feel too bad about talking about and they reacted negatively. How would they react to a me revealing a truth about myself that I view negatively?"
infp,3clwi7,Highbelter,2,Thu Jul 9 04:04:40 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand where you are coming from. I was in pretty much the same situation two years ago, when I came home after my freshman year of college. I felt like my family didn't understand anything about me and I felt pretty alone (except my boyfriend at the time.) My advice to you would be to open up to your family. It doesn't have to be one powerpoint presentation of how you want to live your life, but maybe you feeling more comfortable with yourself where you can feel you can speak the truth wherever you are. And in my case, my family loved me more, and I felt more loved in return, because I opened more of myself to them. And maybe you can find out more about them, and see that they aren't so different from you."

But I didn't talk to my family as much during it, and even though I've overcome it, I still don't know if I'll ever be able to become closer to them.  Maybe I'm still a little depressed.  I don't know.  Hopefully I can mend the bond at some point, though."
infp,3clwi7,elementary_vision,2,Thu Jul 9 05:30:38 2015 UTC,"Yup. But I don't think it's an INFP thing, more like it's common in people with anxiety or depression. I find that it's important to open up to them and be there in the moment with them when I feel like that. I see the dissociation as a sort of a perceptual distortion that isn't true. If I feed those thoughts about them being really foreign, it magnifies it."

At university, I swung between knowing every single person in the class and being friends with multiple groups of people, to hiding in the library alone.   As for places, church groups.

I believe they are rooted in insecurity, and that the actual disrespect could very well be far less than what you think :) In my case I have a lot of distortions about how kindness works. It's not weak, unless you are overly self sacrificing. There is a balance, though. Just make sure you are doing what's best for you first and foremost. Any nice behaviors that come out should be genuine and not rooted in insecurity (ie, only being nice to earn approval from others). It's a short life and it is much better to stay authentic to your genuine self even when others do not like it. It's actually much harder to not be the pretend asshole and deal with perceived lack of respect and other issues head on, rather than copping out by pretending. Buddhists, some of the strongest and wisest people on the planet, probably deal with this often (if they actually interact in public). They might be perceived as passive, too empathetic or too idealistic, which can be looked down upon, especially in Western society. There are naysayers and power-driven egotists out there, but who wants to hang with those types anyway?  I heard these lyrics yesterday, and it reminded me how I often think people do not respect me and I've overcompensated in the past. A lot of that was not true and made up from how my mom treated me.  ""Hey Don't write yourself off yet It's only in your head you feel left out, or looked down on Just try your best Try everything you can And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away."""

Well, unfortunately, in our shite society, infps-stereotypical ones anyway-don't exactly fit the model for what counts as 'masculinity' around these parts. It sucks, but hey, no one's making you fit that model. You need to find your own peeps, and get yourself a good support system to make you feel like less of a freak and help you deal with the sucky people bringing you down. There's tons of infp forums out there, and our types can probably be found in coffee shops/libraries :D It's really awesome that you're happy with yourself, and im sorry you have to deal with these toxic individuals. I'd tell you to try being more assertive-like some of these other commenters have said, don't be afraid to say ""no"" every once in a while. Just show that, even though you're pretty sensitive, it makes you neither a doormat nor a pushover. Believe me dude, i know it's hard. But if you just can't deal, i'd suggest cutting those people out of your life. Some people are just tumours, and you'd be better off rid of them than letting yourself suffer from being attached to them. Cut them loose if you have to, but don't be too mean about it, you'll just feel crappy about it afterwards. Also, some books you may want to check out: Cuckoo in the nest, by Michelle Magorian, and Catcher in the Rye. Pretty sure both the protagonists are male INFPs. Good luck, man. All the best. Mx"
infp,3ck053,gdkmangosalsa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:31:54 2015 UTC,"You don't need to be an asshole to be ""alpha"" or strong. If you are generous, this is done out of strength: ""you can take from me, since I have plenty."" If you are loving, this, too, can be done out of strength: ""I can very easily allow myself to get closer to you, as I am positive nothing you could do could hurt me.""  If, as a typical INFP might have, there are strong convictions in you with regards to good and evil, etc you may find that you can see there is a ""way"" that the world works. Probably you already saw part of it, since you put on a persona to deal with it. Understanding the ways of the world (nature) and not struggling against this way, may lead to a kind of happiness. This does not mean that you give up your principles or ideals. I recommend reading Marcus Aurelius, and other ancient philosophy. Marcus Aurelius was a huge public figure, the freaking Emperor of Rome, but a lot of his stuff probably rings true even for those of us who are more reserved.  ""You have power over your mind--not outside events. Realize this and you will find strength.""  ""The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury."" (It is better to suffer injustice than to be unjust yourself)  For something more contemporary, try Albert Camus, who wrote extensively on the absurd. (The incongruity between man's yearning for reason, order, and meaning and the ""unthinking, meaningless"" external world he lives in--and the importance of not submitting to the terms of the absurd.)"

I had to know every step of how a chapter went before I wrote it, and because I would never know how a certain part went, I spent more time thinking than writing.  In my recent story, I decided to just write first and edit later. That means you have to sit down and write everything that comes to your head, even if it's not the best. It's so much easier to get in the mood to write when you're not hogging yourself down with ""no, I think this should be at the end instead"" or ""this sounds stupid, I'm going to delete it.""  It's difficult at first because you just want to edit and organize everything, but eventually it gets easier."

Let all your ideas stream out and don't worry about organization or grammar or whatever.  Give it a day, go back and read it. What's worth pulling out and working on? If you still have a lot in your head about X topic, do another stream of consciousness on that topic specifically and use that to pull key ideas out of.

As romantics, form is not usually the forte of INFPs.  But we need to learn.  At the same time, form doesn't have to come right away.  Anne Lamott talks about the importance of ""shitty first drafts.""  Let yourself get it all out in the beginning.  If you can do this, amazing!  Since drafting is so difficult for so many people.

I also like to listen to good music, while talking a walk, or sitting at a lake or river and drinking some tea, while the sunset, the calming water and the warmth of the tea do their job.

Please tell me if my assessment is compatible.  I'm great at using Se, so am very perceptive while in the moment. I like noticing things and sensations etc. The more I pay attention and catalogue, the more I am able to remember little details many years into the future. I am very accurate when retelling events. I can review everything, but when I do, it's similar to a memory of a dream. I rewatch the story happen in my head as an observer. However when it comes to feelings, it's transient. My emotional memory of past events is shocking.  I don't know if other people are able to do this or not, but I am unable to relive feelings/emotions. When they're gone, they're gone and I need a new source. I can remember that I felt happy, excited, sad, angry, etc - but it's just a word. Even the feeling of love... I think that's why I constantly look for reassurance to remind me - because I actually don't remember. If I go on a date, and have a wonderful time, I'll spend the next couple of days in the afterglow, almost frantically reliving everything I remember happening to try and commit to my long term memory. I try to remember every sensory detail. But by the end of the week, the feelings have gone. The rush of adrenaline, the pumping of my heart, the butterflies in my stomach, the glow in my cheeks... they're merely words in my head. I am good at retelling the story to myself, and to an extent, my Fe is able to relive the experience through that, but it's not the same. I think it's a reason that in relationships, I can come across as needy and clingy.  My Si is also selective. In my last toxic relationship, we fought all the time, and it would make me so depressed. But wait a week or two, and I was back to being bouncy and optimistic because all the negative feelings were forgotten. It is so easy to live through Se... but having stronger Si would have saved me years of wrong choices.  I'd love others to tell me if they experience something similar, or if I just have a bad memory lol."""

I don't really like to mess around with it because it seems more meaningful if I take it seriously. I've done a few really in-depth readings for strangers and many tears were shed. I don't really like to think of it as ~magic oooh~ but more as a way to help people accept their mistakes in the past and see a way to move forward. People draw their own conclusions and make connections to their own lives from what I say, so it's really just helping people realize things they already knew deep down but maybe needed to hear from someone else's mouth.

Do you belong to a group or practice solo?   I just seriously love how much neopagans focus their attention on loving and taking care of the earth and the animals that inhabit it.

I spit on Astrology, abhor most organised religions and am completely content with lamenting the inevitability of no part of me being left behind, save for a rotting corpse and a potentially salvageable mindstate in the neuron configuration of my brain (until that all dies off too, after a few hours).

If I were angry at someone for something they did, I would meditate and reflect on it. Putting myself in their shoes, specifically. Then afterward I would write a poem about it. Expressing how I felt, what I saw within them, and how they ignored an aspect of our relationship. I've also spent a couple years in astrology and found it was useful as an introspective method to understanding myself to a point. But for understanding others it can be quite difficult.

I don't think they are as strict as other orthodox groups of Islam like Sunnism and Shi'ism.  There are a number of prominent Sufi figures, such as Rumi notable for his Sufi poetry and Al-Ghazali was known for his metaphysical works. And there were Sufi mystics like Rabia Basri and Ibn Arabi as well. The main essence of Sufism is building a solid relationship with the divine being."

I've read a bunch of stuff from mysticism to stoicism, existentialism, etc. I go to church usually 2-4 times per month. And, yes, I do enjoy long walks to myself. I should pray/meditate more than I do.  I think religion is great as long as you avoid the highly popularized ideas and forms of it. There are people who would have you believe that god is a dude, on a throne somewhere up in the sky, looking down and judging you. lol. There's so much to be gained if you explore it more philosophically, I find. The idea of god is so much richer than that. Eventually you reach the point where you see how useless your intellect might be in the pursuit of the spiritual, but at least for me, I had to use a lot of intellect to reach that point.  I do think all religions point towards or are interested in the same truth. Their differences mainly arise thanks to the fact that this truth and knowledge of it arose in a lot of different cultures independently. Truth is independent of culture (and thus of man) but each (man-made) culture might find a different way of expressing or relating to it. This is one reason why I don't see any need to leave the church I was born into, for instance."
infp,3chjy0,lancerusso,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:52:21 2015 UTC,"Peripatetic school:       The Peripatetic school was a school of philosophy in Ancient Greece.  Its teachings derived from its founder, the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, and peripatetic is an adjective ascribed to his followers. The school originally derived its name Peripatos (Greek: Περίπατος) from the peripatoi (περίπατοι, ""colonnades"") of the Lyceum in Athens where the members met. A similar Greek word peripatetikos (περιπατητικός) refers to the act of walking, and as an adjective, ""peripatetic"" is often used to mean itinerant, wandering, meandering, or walking about. After Aristotle's death, a legend arose that he was a ""peripatetic"" lecturer – that he walked about as he taught – and the designation Peripatetikos came to replace the original Peripatos. [citation needed]  The school dates from around 335 BCE when Aristotle began teaching in the Lyceum. It was an informal institution whose members conducted philosophical and scientific inquiries. Aristotle's successors Theophrastus and Strato continued the tradition of exploring philosophical and scientific theories, but after the middle of the 3rd century BCE, the school fell into a decline, and it was not until the Roman era that there was a revival. Later members of the school concentrated on preserving and commenting on Aristotle's works rather than extending them, and the school eventually died out in the 3rd century CE.  Although the school died out, the study of Aristotle's works continued by scholars who were called Peripatetics through Later Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the works of the Peripatetic school were lost to the west, but in the east they were incorporated into early Islamic philosophy, which would play a large part in the revival of Aristotle's doctrines in Europe in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

I get along very well with ISTJs, obviously my long term boyfriend is one, as is one of my best friends, and I recently met a man on a plane who was ISTJ - we talked for 8 hours straight.

They often have a dramatic flair and tend to be emotionally expressive. Fours with a Five wing are more withdrawn and, while still predominantly emotional, more likely to be intellectuals who infuse their feelings with ideas.

It's just that goddamn beginning (and sometimes the ending, depending on how I'm feeling when I watch it). Life is Beautiful. Italian film that takes place during WWII (you can see that I'm a huge sucker for war films…), but if this doesn't make you cry, I don't know what will (maybe the other ones I listed, haha). Amour. French film about an elderly couple, with the wife slipping into dementia and the husband trying to make the most of it. Lilo & Stitch. It's really that moment where Stitch leaves Lilo and then runs into that family of ducks that kills me. Also screw Frozen, Lilo & Stitch had the best Disney sister relationship. Her. It didn't make me cry, but it left me feeling very empty inside.   And now for tearjerker books:   Khaled Hosseini's books. Literally every single one of them made me cry at some point.

It is self defeating bullshit. We fit in the working world (and school for that matter) in a particular way. Go read Please Understand Me II by David Kiersey if you haven't already, and read it again if you have. Read it all the way through. Type is not about finding out your limits much less placing limits on yourself. It is about recognizing how people think and move through the world. What motivates them and how they relate and communicate to other so that we are not plastering other peoples minds over with ours.   There is space for INFPs in any industry, any business, any field. We will just bring our own INFP flair to the proceedings. What understanding personality types does is let us not beat ourselves up for not doing the same thing as everyone else in the same way.    Obviously business school is a little bit soul-sucking, but I'm getting through it.   So put some soul into it. You have plenty to spare. We INFPs are always throwing our souls around anyways to anyone who asks for it. There is always more where it came from.    What I want to know from you guys that are doing what you love, how did you decide on it, how did you get yourself there, what is your work style like, and how do you measure your own success?    I am a children's librarian. It is a long somewhat boring story of how I got there, that can pretty much be summed up with: I am a librarian and the children's assistant left and I took over because I really enjoy reading and being goofy with kids.   So technically if you were just going by type a ESFJ would be an ideal children's librarian. But so what? I bring my own thing to the job and am fairly successful at it. Could I improve? Certainly! But I am not going to let a silly thing like type keep me from doing what I want to do.   So you are in an awesome place right now. The skill set of basic business acumen and heart is tremendously powerful and valuable. I am reading The Magic of Thinking Big by David J. Schwartz and it is like if the practicality of a ESTJ and the heart of an INFP got together and co-wrote a self-help book in the 50s. It is fantastic!   So all in all: don't sell yourself short."
infp,3cfwn7,macjoven,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for such a thorough comment. I'll try to find the book at my local library. I appreciate the recommendation since there are so many books out there on MBTI, and I can never tell which ones would be the most worthwhile to read.  I don't think I'm bad at school or work. On the contrary, I get great marks and have had employee of the month, and things like that. But I feel less and less motivated to accomplish what other people want me to do. I go through the motions in a very committed way, but once I'm by myself I don't feel fulfilled.   That's sort of what I was getting at with this question, just to get others' perspectives on what they do, why they do it, and why it makes them happy. I know there's a good role out there for me, whether it's as an entrepreneur, illustrator, or whatever. I'm not trying to find a job to fit my type per se. I'm really looking for insight into how other INFPs have used their personality to their advantage in whatever they've set out to do. I guess that would be the reverse approach?  Your example is great though. I actually taught my nephew how to read when he was in kindergarten so I kind of understand where you're coming from. Reading with kids is such a pleasure because they're so open about their thoughts and feelings. I love seeing how surprised they are by something they're able to read all of a sudden."

infp,3cfwn7,k8sowelly,2,Tue Jul 7 21:40:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a teacher. I spent three years teaching kids with special needs, now I have my own classroom and I teach 4th grade. It is really hard work and it's exhausting, but I absolutely love it. And--especially because of my creativity--I'm pretty fucking awesome at it. I integrate a lot of the arts into my teaching; for example my students take social studies ""notes"" by basically creating their own comic books about history...we don't use a textbook. I am so genuinely excited and happy in my classroom. I gush over children's work and usually cry (happy tears) on a weekly basis because kiddos are so amazing. I am VERY happy in my work and I can't picture myself doing anything else.  Edit: I also want to say, I could have done something artistic/creative such as graphic design and I bet I'd be happy. But there's something about guiding a group of children, seeing them grow from the first day of school to the last, it just really... satisfies something deep in me that there is this cycle of meaningful growth that I get to be a part of. That's why I steered away from other jobs, I don't think I'd like working in an office where things are pretty much the same day after day."
infp,3cfwn7,kidfay,2,Wed Jul 8 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a mechanical engineer with a grad degree. I've always felt like I liked or could make myself like most things but got through college without figuring out what I love doing. I did refrigeration research for a couple of years. It was ok, I was good at it and so on, but wasn't my passion. After a while it becomes doing similar tests on similar systems and the results just become data for charts for powerpoints. What was good about it was that I was relatively free, all I had to do was just keep forward motion. What was bad was that there wasn't any context--don't know what anything means or how it plugs into stuff or what is really wanted.  Over a year ago I was looking at a job website for my city and there was a position at the power company for a natural gas engineer. I'd never considered utilities especially being a mechanical but as a kid I liked simulation computer games like Sim City. I applied, all I heard about it sounded better and better, and got it.  Things have been amazing! Engineering natural gas totally lights my fire. I've totally un-depressed--I had a sort of general grinding malaise since childhood. My job is keeping the systems running well, checking jobs that the field engineers put in and jobs going out to operations, coming up with system improvements, supporting operations, running projects, and being the local contact for interfacing with the other groups in the company like transmission and metering. What really motivates me is that I'm responsible for keeping fellow coworkers and the public safe. It's so motivating to be able to use my engineering skills to serve the people and towns. And also I'm management in a mostly union workplace so I like the special responsibility to do well that goes along with that. We all count on each other and a lot of bucks stop at my desk.  Probably a quarter of my work is keeping things covered. The rest is spread over running projects, looking for and planning system improvements, and fixing/improving things--correcting mapping and stuff. So far everyone above me seems happy. There's no one breathing down my neck and I can go out in the field or visit the other locations and no one's watching my location or time. The higher ups encourage us getting out in the field with the crews. I can mess around in software to see what happens with the systems if this or that was changed and stare at maps and learn street names and estimate time and money. It's not hard to come up with ways to improve things. What's hard is to come up with improvements that will get approved and built.   The field engineers get customer visits scheduled to their calendars from one of the call centers when someone calls the company about adding loads or construction and that sort of a thing would make me really uncomfortable. I'm open-minded but I appreciate routine. I really don't like being told what to do. I'd get very bored if I were a union person who shows up, works, and then goes home. I need brain work and tinkering and stuff I can ruminate on. I avoid confrontation which I'm working on because I need to get more forceful about reminding people to work on the projects I need them too.  I also really like working at a big company. There are lots of future directions I could go within the company. It's also nice to have a definite hierarchy and clearly defined roles. The previous job was at a small, young company run by academic engineers. That was a clusterfuck. There wasn't any money, the people running it weren't business people or minded, and there was no career progression or development encouraged. There was no where to be promoted--one manager officially above me who ran the business day to day with the owner above him.  I'm not sure how I measure ""success"". I've got plenty of time and the company hires from within. I doubt I'd make it to VP (or want to do it since it's highly political from what I've heard) but that'd only be four job changes up. There's probably a dozen years or more of growth and promotions in my current position. I'm going through training for the positions I work over and then I'll do the PE next year. Right now I feel like I could do my job for the rest of my career--the geographically next closest person in my position who recently retired did his job for 35 years, but he had let bridges burn and closed his doors. Right now there's still so much learning it's awesome. There's always stuff to learn and things to spot.  So in conclusion: I love my job. What I like about it is serving people as an engineer, it's self-directed with responsibility, and that there's a long-term future.  Also don't forget, these personality codes are just group labels. Don't take it too seriously. Be yourself first, like what you want and do what you want, regardless of what the label says the people in the group 'should' be like."

infp,3cfwn7,halfskye,2,Wed Jul 8 04:36:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a software engineer.  Up until March of this year, I worked within the video games industry.  After 7-8 years in, I finally decided to take the break I'd been hoping to take pretty much since I started.  Back in high school I was a great deal more involved in Art and enjoyed it immensely but kind of just dropped it all due to the pressure of picking something more ""practical"" for my life.  While I greatly appreciate the opportunities that software has afforded, I've never quite felt like it was my truest calling.  I'm still making software but am working for a more general business and marketing place now, which has allowed me to stick to no more than a 40-hour work week, which has in turn allowed me to explore myself and my hobbies a bit more.  I recently took up creating nature aquariums with live plants and shrimp, and am also now taking an oil painting class to get my feet wet again for the Art world.  I'm hoping to use this more general opportunity to figure out my next big leap.  Something where I could help others seems very appealing, or maybe something more out in nature.  It just feels like it'd be a shame to throw away the expertise that I have now.  My girlfriend who just became a 2nd grade teacher says she thinks I'd be a good teacher so maybe I'll pursue an educational track with software somehow.  I think I'll always be both satisfied in a general sense with whatever's going on, but always restless about finding my real place in the world."
infp,3cfwn7,MosaicLifestyle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"I can't say that I'm HAPPY HAPPY, but right now just learning to be satisfied with what I have. I studied engineering, which I decided against pursuing strictly based off of the fact that I felt out of touch with all my classmates, then jumped into business/finance.  The corporate world was way too stifling for me, although I found that I work quite well in a very structured environment, perhaps a learned trait from schooling. Now I work for a big data startup, where I get to use my business knowledge and experience to work with corporate clients, but the nature of the job lends itself to the bigger picture, and weaving creative, convincing stories. Perhaps one day I'll grow the balls to jump into something truly creative, but for the time being this is not a bad compromise (and the pay doesn't hurt either).  So I guess my lesson has been, within the business world there are niches where you might fit in better than others. Small businesses are probably a better bet than big, hierarchical behemoths (their pitches on work environment are just for marketing purposes, from what I've seen). That being said, I haven't found a way to deal with annoying things like email, scheduling, and overly-strategic/inauthentic business communication styles, but I just hope that the quality of my work and ideas can compensate for that effectively.

Working in an office isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I really feel like I hit the jackpot with this gig.   I think ""fitting in"" is a state of mind.

Anyway, it is good to hear there are still things you enjoy (it could be worse no?). It is also good to hear there are things you don't enjoy! And let me tell you why:  It's because of contrast. You can't feel happy all the time, if you would then feeling happy would be normal and you wouldn't feel anything at all. Sure being happy is nicer than being sad, scared, angry or ashamed. But without those other feelings to give contrast we wouldn't feel different layers of happiness. It is a fact of life we have to accept: There are good times and bad times. For every black color you have a white color, for every light you have a shadow. Stars burn brighter when the nights are darker. So don't worry too much about feeling happy all the time.  As for doing things and motivate yourself, you could do the following:    Divide big tasks into smaller tasks (a book needs a theme, genre, introduction, plot and whatnot). Start with the smaller tasks first to get into the right 'working flow'. Reward yourself for doing a task or step.  And sometimes you just have to do things. Especially if you don't like them, that way you enjoy what you do like even more!   And never feel bad for venting or ranting here. I atleast can always appreciate a good rant or ask for help! I'm sure there are plenty of others too. So please share whatever you feel like sharing, we will try and be there for you (and others) as best as we can!"

What I've found at least according to the internet if you've never dated and in your mid 20s there is a ton more work you need to do, your so far behind. This year I've spent about 6 months reading books on how to act around women, what to say around women 1000 ways to be alpha.    First off what happened to all these friends who are girls/ women? Why do you think it was so easy to make so many female friends? What about your personality do you think made them want to spend time with you? How many of them do you think might have been interested in being more than friends? How many of them did you approach boldly about this kind of thing?  If you're creating a wholly fabricated persona to be more attractive to women it won't take very long for them to catch on that the you that you're presenting isn't at all genuine especially since it likely comes across more than you realize that this person comes across as scripted and shallow.   If you're interested in having positive dating experiences stop taking it so seriously. Stop attempting to ""be this whole other person"" simply on the chance it will get you more dates. If you want to ""improve"" yourself, by all means do so but do it for you.  Embrace ""romantic rejection"" and don't let it cloud your perception of self worth. If you're being a person you'd like to spend time with and get to know better chances are other people will feel similarly, not everyone mind you... but the ones who do will really like you for you even if this doesn't ever involve sexual encounters.   /r/OkCupid and OKCupid in general are bullshit unless you're an attractive woman of average weight or smaller chances are it is NOT going to work out well for you no matter how ""smartly"" you sculpt your profile.   When you meet a woman you find attractive and fun, tell her ""I think you're attractive and fun, would you like to go do (have a specific event/ outing in mind on a slightly less specific timescale if possible, like ""next weekend"") with me?""  This is literally all you need to do, then get to know one another. Make it clear to her you find her attractive, this is important because otherwise she might not understand you're asking her out on a date especially if you never use that word when you ask her.   There's a better than good chance in any of these encounters or dates she's not going to be on the same page as you; this is good especially if she lets you know right away in direct terms. Did you enjoy spending time with her? Yes, good! Now you have a new friend who also has other friends, especially other women you can meet and pursue should you find them attractive and fun. This is how you make a social circle. If you're under the impression that you shouldn't be friends with women who ""just aren't that into you"" and your ONLY goal is to spend time with women who want on your genitals... you're doing it wrong. You're going to be disappointed forever. If you maintain good relationships with others for a long enough period of time you'll find many of them come around later on, especially if various factors made romance at the first contact encounter an impossibility. Bad timing is no reason to dismiss a future with someone you find attractive and seemingly 'rejects' your advances in the then and there.   If you want to be successful at dating make and maintain relationships with people you enjoy spending time with; don't pine over ""what could have been"" just enjoy them for the rad people they are and they will definitely take notice of your worth, even if that notice involves nothing more than introducing you to all of their female friends who might be a better fit with you than they are romantically."
infp,3cf7ef,SensoryOverlord,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:58:32 2015 UTC,They were just friends we just happen to live close by I grew up with a lot of them. But as I went through school they kind of vanished. Being a total novice at dating I treated them exactly as friends. Didn't approach any of them.
infp,3cf7ef,wildweeds,14,Wed Jul 8 03:10:30 2015 UTC,"i say fuck the alpha shit, fuck trying to be someone else. Its tiring. It's exhausting. To be trying to be someone you are not. To try to do things so that you can gain the approval of others. That may get you relationships, that may get you some friends, that may get you nights of sex.  But in the end it's your false persona, someone you are not whose getting those things. Not you.   Don't worry about others being masters, don't worry about how far behind you are (you think you are). Those are all superficial matters. You can fix them, but a hole WILL reappear at another place. You fix the next hole and another WILL reappear. It's endless. You can't.  What you should be striving for is just to be YOURSELF and be LOVE! Love yourself, love who you are, and love others for who they are. Be YOURSELF, be GENUINE! It's GREAT to read books on how to act around women. It's PSYCHOLOGY. But don't do things that aren't YOU.   Because that shit's dumb."

infp,3cf7ef,somewheretrumpets,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:20:33 2015 UTC,"What does that sentence even mean? And wildweeds is absolutely correct in everything she's said.  I'd like to add a few more things though. Such as, why do you want to be in a relationship? And more importantly, what would the purpose of being in a relationship be?   To me, it doesn't matter at all if you never dated while in school, it probably would've been an immature relationship anyway. I really don't think the INFP mindset fits with hookup culture anyway, seeing as generally we're striving for deeper more authentic bonds.  I never really looked for a relationship personally, but I'm also in one currently with a very close friend, so...food for thought.  I think the best thing you can do is take some time to reflect on your motivations and really just make some female friends, cause there is a window between meeting someone and being classified as only a friend."
infp,3cf7ef,macjoven,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:26:51 2015 UTC,To me it sounds like regardless of if you that girl or not you just want someone to want you. I don't know.  I don't have a good answer for even wanting to be in a relationship. You see other people with their SO and I get the feeling why don't I have that.  You would think after my parents divorced and tons of people at work are telling me to stay single forever. Why would should I even bother if it's going to end in disaster and end up being more bitter than I am now.  Maybe that's the problem motivations I have none. I have hobbies and things I like to do in my free time but nothing I want to do all the time. The things like to do outside of my house I don't interact with many women let alone any I could become friends with. I understand that it's a process that I've been blind to for the better part of 20 years and I have some catching up to do.

infp,3cf7ef,paulexander,2,Wed Jul 8 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say wanting or having a relationship should be about wanting someone to want you, so much as a mutual bond where you both grow and help each other grow.   I'm sure you've heard the saying ""you first must love yourself before you can love another."" and I feel like it's rather applicable here, cause if you think that there's no point to dating cause ""it'll end in disaster"" it'll probably do just that. But even more important than that is to get into a relationship with the right person at the right time for you, cause what is the point otherwise?   When you say ""for the better part of 20 years"", what age are you counting from, cause I would think (and hope) that most people look for a potential marriage partner around the time they're at uni. Cause really, a relationship's either gonna end with a break up, or a marriage. (I guess it could be dragged out...but I dunno why someone would do that. Extreme fear of commitment? Idk.)"

infp,3cehy5,rate_reducer,2,Tue Jul 14 01:05:41 2015 UTC,"You're lucky, you're actually able to pick a favorite band (or anything else for that matter). I do well to make a top five list, which abandons spaces two and one--leaving hope alive that someday, some greater artist shall come along and fill the void(s).   I spent a little time with Sonic Youth, back when I was into My Bloody Valentine, Curve, and other swirly, wall-of-noise bands. ""Dirty"" is an amazing album. If it were released tomorrow (albeit, with EQ adjustments, allowing it to nestle comfortably into the contemporary soundscape), it would do just as well now as it did then (possibly better). However, I found ""Dirty"" possessed some sort of magic other Sonic Youth albums just couldn't match, at least for me, any way. Doesn't stop me from admiring the talent, just doesn't fully fuel the fire.  Do you find yourself skipping over the factory churned blasé, and opting for music which communicates with you more? There has to be emotion. Without emotion, there is no communication. I've been in bands with some of the most technically gifted players I have ever heard, and while they might be able to beautifully string together a jillion note per second, they can't tell you how they feel via a guitar. While they'd show boat with their notes, I'd pick four chords as a response to them and play them as an emotional rainbow--one second sad and lethargic, the next with punk angst, then Beatles happy, so on and so forth. Thus, I look for the same from the bands I follow. If your first to albums are insanely emotionally charged , then your third drops to cookie cutter crap.... Well...it was nice having you as a favorite band for a short while."

He may not need to vent (unless it's about you) but surely there are things that he may be wanting to talk about. The reason this helps me is because when I'm presented with someone else's situation, I immediately start thinking from their context and become curious about their circumstance. It takes my mind off my own problems and puts them into perspective later. Sort of like a ""well I guess everyone has problems"" thing. It also forces you to be more emotionally available, which will in turn motivate him to be more emotionally available back to you later.  Also, if you feel yourself overwhelming someone, maybe just write about it privately in stream of conscious mode. Leave it alone for a couple days and then come and read it with fresh eyes. I've done this several times and it always makes me feel better.  Good luck to you."

When you trust them and when you cannot keep for yourself your troubles.   Since my last break-up, I keep to myself a lot. I don't want to brother anyone with my life and my inner world. It's a fear, actually. I'm very anxious about it. Being a burden is something I really really fear. I'm so afraid about it that I might be too private actually, I don't let people get to really know me.   Anyway, you may have relied too much on your friend. That wasn't very healthy. But can't it be fixed ? Perhaps you should let some time to your friend to get over it, and to let some time to yourself to be alone a bit and to think alone. What do you need ? Someone to listen to you? A friend ? Or something else, other than people ? I don't know your life, neither do I know your problems, but you might need to think about it. You may try to write, that helps. And about your relationship with your friend, how was it? Was it only rant from you? You may try to truly share with him and to ask him about him, his life etc, not only ranting.   And please, don't be sorry for ranting here. Nobody will get mad at you or will reproach you to rant. Do it if you need to and don't regret it. If you need to talk, I'm here.   Oh and btw you said :    my insecurity over the things he's good at always gets me spiraling down, and I end up ranting all over again.   I feel exactly the same with my bf. I'm so ashamed and mad at myself for this, excepted that I don't rant to him. But i'm very insecure, and moreover besides him, because he's so talented and confident.

It looked like it may have fallen off the roof of a car by the way everything was strewn about, so I picked it up, gathered all its contents and brought it into work. I gave it to the one sales manager I can trust and he called the lady and left a message. She came in the next day, before I came into work, absolutely relieved to have recovered it along with all its contents. She ended up leaving me $100 which my sales manager passed on to me when I arrived.  My coworkers were all telling me that they don't think they could have done what I did. They said they probably would have taken all the money and used cards, while others said they would have just left it.   For me, it's easy: The wallet was not mine to take anything from, the lady is most likely freaking out, frantically searching for it, and I just can't help but do the right thing.

infp,3cdn9q,starseedlove,2,Tue Jul 7 02:28:38 2015 UTC,"Oh yes I definitely can relate. I'm a 31/f in a long term committed relationship but there are parallels based on your description :)  A few years ago I decided to incorporate Buddhism into my life and religiously read texts like those by nun Pema Chodron. It boosted my confidence and sense of calm because they were concepts easy to understand, and I could face the world in a more head on way with fearlessness, forgiveness and compassion, rather than power or insecurity.  This is all that matters, in the long run. For awhile now I've also dabbled in learning assertiveness skills and boosting my self esteem, reading books like Anxious to Please, which defines over-niceness as an epidemic that is based on anxious attachment styles we inherent from having parents who were distant or neglectful, unloving or even abusive. That really hit the nail on the head so I began questioning why I was being so nice, and a least part of it wasn't for the right reason- it was because I selfishly felt insecure and wanted people to like me, not because I cared about them. So, I try to think of my niceness is genuine or just ingratiating these days. Assertiveness comes easier, and I even decided to start therapy to improve my self esteem.  At the end, though, I was never as happy and well balanced, confident and calm as when I took a warrior approach to life, with empathy and compassion, as it sounds like you've described. It is approaching heaven on earth, because I retrained my mind to be forgiving and less harsh, which were the root causes of the depression. It is the only way. The other stuff is not working. And I'm starting to think being nice is not so bad. It's actually preferable, and I don't give a crap if people don't treat with respect or think I'm ingratiating anymore. That's all ego anyway.   This was an unnecessarily long story, but if it has a point at all, it might be that you're fine as you are, and the power to break up, assert boundaries, and do/ask for what you want while remaining truly nice (or whatever words you'd like to use) is already within you. You can trust yourself that when the times comes you'll be ready and even if it's hard, you'll be successful. Just keep thinking about the warrior way of living, and maybe even avoid all the stuff I did (unless you already have) reading about nice girl/guy syndrome. It was in my nature to be caring, and I'm much harder on myself and possibly more depressed now. Being nice is criticized by some, but some people just are more nice naturally and it's a beautiful trait. It should not be squashed with harsh reprimands and shame based literature that focuses on the largely power-driven, but far less grounded, society in America (although I do agree with the books that say it can be unhealthy if done for the wrong reasons- and if you feel you can't do or ask for things you personally need in this short life, it's not good). We need more genuinely nice people to tip the scales and help people find compassion and meaning in their lives again. This got off subject as its a topic I'm very passionate about :) hope you find the right answers for you"

Good time to reassess your needs and wants in relationship. Stop listening to your friend, he's just doing his job in being supportive, and begin a journey of emotional honesty for the sake of your future relationships. Ask yourself why you stuck around with an overly dependent and manipulative spouse for twelve years.  Twelve years. 'Niceness' doesn't cut it as an answer."

infp,3cddk7,dry_russell,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:53:17 2015 UTC,exactly. INFPs are generally more forgiving.
infp,3cddk7,bezald,3,Fri Jul 10 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"INFPs are better at being INFPs. I don't know, I don't really care what I (as a type) am 'better' at. I much rather learn on what I (as individual) can improve on. One thing I don't like doing at all is talking negative of others. And that isn't type related, so I much rather talk negative of myself since I can change myself.   I like who I am, I like the type I am. No one can change that by talking (and comparing themselves negatively) about me. From now on, if people not respect me for who I am, I don't want to be around them. Sure everyone gets a second chance, but not alot more than that. You don't need people in your life who can only talk negatively and express other toxic behavior towards you. You are worth so much more than that. Be kind, open and gentle. But be strong and confident in your own values."
infp,3cddk7,Meenjedit,3,Tue Jul 7 10:18:10 2015 UTC,"I'd say INFP's are more aware that their thoughts are out of touch with the real world. INFP's are also more in-tune with their inner world. I once saw the example (sorry can't remember where or I would cite it) that an INFJ can observe a droplet of water and analyze it as a metaphor for a bunch of things going on in the world. For example, they might conclude that droplet of water = true nature of the universe. INFJ's are unaware that their opinions are totally subjective. An INFP in the same situation would be completely aware that any conclusions are only based off their own personal experience, thoughts, and opinions. INFP knows it's subjective. For an INFP that's the point of pondering almost anything.   In keeping with this thought INFP's can be a bit more flexible. INFJ's expect the world to be a certain way because that's how they see it. Also INFJ's are out to fix things and people because they want to improve the world to fit their vision. INFP's are aware that the world isn't so cut and dry. That's why INFP's spend more time in their inner world working on themselves. The two types are actually very different."
infp,3cddk7,KassyKay,2,Tue Jul 7 19:42:13 2015 UTC,"I literally have no clue nor have I seen this comparison. But from my own experience of speaking to an INFJ, I personally don't see that much of the difference other than how we approach situations. I really wouldn't worry about it tbh. It's a bit of nonsense to compare and we know where that one goes."

What I'd usually do is try and take into account certain reasons why that person doesn't share in or believe in that certain idea/etc. What about their background strongly influences them? Is it possible they may be misinformed about some things hence leading to (possibly) wrong beliefs?  (I'm kinda sleepy as of this writing so I'll fix it in the morning when I wake up.

infp,3cbvuu,zekecahill,3,Mon Jul 6 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"On board with what zeke said!!  Initially, I try hard to think outside my own beliefs and put myself in their shoes, (not necessarily by compromising my own beliefs but  to understand where they're coming from)   If their philosophy/ ideas are really negative/ harmful/ backwards thinking, my next step is to reason in my head how external influences may affect the person to think that way or maybe they just haven't been exposed to healthier/ worldly ideas. It's the negative beliefs I don't like, not the person. I try to separate the two. People's beliefs can change, it may take time.  Lastly, when I'm sharing my thoughts, I find that it helps to do it in a very neutral manner.. so that it comes off as me sharing a idea rather than forcing my opinion on someone and generally people receive things I have to say better as well. No matter how true our beliefs are to us, in the end it's all subjective. Delivery is important, if people feel like you're attacking their ideals, they'll defend and cling to them even more."

It might mean a little more understanding amongst my friends and coworkers, and maybe even convincing people to change things about them.

infp,3caryb,BensonHedges1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:40:14 2015 UTC,"You are certainly not alone, it happens to almost everyone sometimes (or multiple) times in our lifes. There are plenty of books, paintings and movies (all the midlife crisis kind) made about self-identity. It is easier to be aware of what you are not than to recognize what you are. We start to look for what we want to be, and strive to be a 'perfect' person. What we often forget is that: What we want to be makes us what and who we are in the moment.   Even when we behave what others expect from us we are still us. The only thing that is different is that our image of our ""ideal self"" doesn't match the moment. Our expectations of how we should (and want to) behave feels as if it is wrong.  I read something a while back of Carl Rogers on self-identity and identification. There are three things we look for when we see ourselves.   Self image: how we see ourselves at the moment. Self esteem/worth: how much we love ourselves. Ideal self: What do we want to be?   We often mismatch our ideal self with our self image what makes our self esteem go down. We love ourselves less because we can't life up to our ideal self. We can raise our self esteem or we can bring our ideal self more in line with our self image. It takes a realisation (not only knowledge) to do this. At the moment I don't really know how to lower your ideal self other than knowing that the only person that can be your ideal self is you, and if it is only you then it already is you.   Also do some excercises to raise your self-esteem and confidence!  And if you don't know what your ideal self is or how you should behave: just look for role models and copy them (or make somethings you like about them yours in your own way). We copied behavior when we were kids, why shouldn't we now? The only thing that changed is that we are more aware that we do it and what we copy. Which is good otherwise we could have unwanted 'bad and toxic' behavior.  Heh, sorry for the long reply :p (also not really in context).The good life is a process, not a state of being. It is a direction, not a destination.  Lots of love, because you are beautiful for who you are! <3"
infp,3caryb,Meenjedit,2,Mon Jul 6 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"You certainly added a smile to my day!! Very wise words, that I will do my best to take to the heart. Sometimes it's just so easy to get lost in the shuffle of everything. ""Knowing the only person that can be your ideal self is you"" is just what I needed to hear."
infp,3caryb,BensonHedges1,3,Tue Jul 7 11:18:19 2015 UTC,"I am what I want to be, I guess that is me. As a child I didn't had this knowledge, this understanding of self-identity. I felt as if I was just me. But me is just a name tied to an appearance tied to a personality. Growing up you become aware of this self-identity, you start to question: ""Did I make me or did others define it for me?"".  It took me a while (and is still ongoing), to find the answer to this question. The answer I am at now is: yes and yes.  Yes, you shape yourself for a part. And yes others shape you for the other part. A balance between these is important to feel good about yourself. Humans (like apes) are social animals. We need to be social and have social interaction to survive. Without any love (healthy acceptance of others) we go crazy. And without any love for ourselves we can go just as crazy. So we need some time for ourselves to have a moment to love ourselves.   I think you can divide who you are in to two parts: the I and the Me. The Me is your social-self, how you are in society. You adapt yourself to the rules of a group. The I responses to the Me (the social view a person has) and the I questions the Me (personal response). How strong the I is depends on your self-esteem. The I can then shape the Me, so you feel confident in a social setting. You feel more I in Me, you feel more you.   So basically you are a mix of a group, stereotype or role model you identified with and you who questions these things. We categorize ourself in a group (or in more extreme and sad cases, others do this for us). We then identify ourselves as part of that group and behave and act the same way. After that we compare ourselves to that group to raise ourself-esteem. And after a while maybe categorize and identify with an other group. This feeling you are part of something creates a feeling you are you. Categorizing, identifying and comparing all raises ourself esteem. That is one of the beautiful things that this subreddit does. We identify ourselves with others like us and feel better about ourselves, more confident because we are not the only ones that behave and act a certain way. So we dare to act more this way.   Defining who you are is hard and complicated. I still don't know who I am but I feel a lot more confident lately because I can see that I am accepted by others. You don't have to do much, just have good intentions and feel confident. The last thing is hard when being depressed. I know from personal experience. I separated myself because I didn't feel like I was accepted. Funny thing is that this isn't the case at all. You can't always do things alone, you need others to help you out sometimes. And you don't have to feel guilty about it, especially when you help out others when they need it.   Anyway, this is all I know. I still don't really know what I am. So for the time being I am just who I want to be. Who I would like to be. This is one of many reasons why it is useful to dream. What helped me feel better are the following things (mostly things that basically ups your self-esteem):   Do things you like doing. Don't only sit inside, go outside from time to time. Also open curtains and windows, the more natural light the better Try and eat healthy (more vitamins, so lots of green and fish) Exercise Do at least one goofy thing every day that makes you giggle or laugh (like dancing or pulling a weird face in front of the mirror) If you wake up or go to bed, make yourself as big as possible (this boosts your confidence, might feel weird but it helps)  And most importantly socialize with the group you feel comfortable with.  And if it gets to much, listen to your body. Take rest if it says so.    Like I probably said a few times before: I still don't really know who I am but it doesn't bother me in feeling happy. So I just am who I want to be. If you have any questions or want to tell something more, please feel free to do so!   You are great for who you are, you are beautiful for who you are. I believe you are, even if you don't know who you are. <3"

infp,3caryb,jajajajaja12345,2,Mon Jul 6 14:39:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm going through something similar. I've recently realized how extremely stifled I've been in the past, not really being myself or feeling like I could be myself around most of the people in my life. But after some serious life changes (including death of a mother, disastrous falling out with my sister, getting married to someone I could be myself with), I started realizing just how not true to myself I had been. I went through a period of struggling in life afterward because of discontent with people and location and financial struggle. We moved locations and have been working out job situations throughout the past year. And now FINALLY I have a good job and we're no longer struggling. And now that I'm not focused on all that crap, I'm realizing I've got through a process of discovering what I'm not. But really, I have no idea who I actually am at this point. I'm feeling a little lost. This weekend I'm going to hang out with some old high school friends (2 of the few people I've ever felt free to be myself around in life) and hoping that will have a sort of ""grounding"" effect.   Also, I've learned I really love my Ne side, which involves exploring possibilities and always seeking new experiences. So I'm working on developing that more by throwing myself into new things, keeping myself open to all kinds of experiences. I'm hoping this will help me grow into myself more."
infp,3caryb,journeyofsam,2,Mon Jul 6 15:26:32 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way as you describe OP - in fact I was just thinking about this last night. I started experiencing depression when I was 18 and had just started college, a time when I think for many depression starts to show its face. However, I often compare myself to how I was before the depression, when I was just a carefree kid, not yet an adult. I didn't question myself as much, went with the natural flow of things. And now that I've finally acknowledged the depression, sought treatment, and am fighting my way out of it, I don't know at what point things will feel fully right again - perhaps it is not something worth striving for, as I have changed so much from this experience.   Even just a year or two ago, when I was 23-24, I felt like my level of vitality and energy was much higher. Granted, I was also reckless, and drinking too much, etc. But in my new, healthier life, things just feel more...boring. I probably need to just grow into this new life, find new activities and friends away from that old life.  Perhaps it is time to let go of the past, or at least acknowledge that it has passed, and seek to make the best person I can out of who I am now. I just love nostalgia so much, and I've always been melancholy, so it represents one of the deepest wells of feeling that I have access to these days. But I really do wish I could be as fiercely passionate as I once was, feel love as deeply as I once could...depression is a terrible thing, and I wouldn't wish it upon anybody. It's sad that so many suffer from it."

That true self got hurt very badly and hid itself under the mask of depression.. I could deal with the depression part alone, just me being depressed. But what I am right now is not me, it's just some ghost or some shadow. I'm very glad that there's people out there who can relate..

It's hard for me to be attracted to the super deep types because I'm wary of the emotional baggage that comes along with it.

infp,3c8phb,Medaled,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"I just haven't heard of many great philosophers, I mean yeah we have Kierkegaard but I wouldn't say he's actually a groundbreaking philosopher. I mean he does actually defend taking the leap of faith, not exactly strong with the logic here. Out of the big philosophers perhaps Schopenhauer was an INFP too, but I feel like that's it, not really an INFP thing I think even though we can be interested in the subject."
infp,3c8phb,KoenigAllant,2,Mon Jul 6 04:08:20 2015 UTC,"I see philosophy as something you don't look to strive for recognition in - a true philosopher seeks knowledge, no matter who/where it comes from, so long as you get the chance to discuss and think and broaden your perspectives on whatever topic.  Maybe the greatest philosophers ARE INFPs,for all we know - they only do it rather for the love of knowledge, than the love of fame and being noticed."
infp,3c8phb,Medaled,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think the great minds of philosophy were just trying to get recognized, if you have notable ideas you will get noticed. And INFPs don't seem to have grand ideas in philosophy a lot. Also yeah I agree, INFPs have a strong sense for aesthetic and that is a branch of philosophy, my only statement was that INFPs don't make the best philosophers. I reckon NT's do (Plato, Socrates, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Descartes, Heidegger, Hegel, etc.)"
infp,3c8phb,KoenigAllant,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:10:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like we do have grand ideas - a lot of us just don't like to speak out, so we bring ourselves to think that nobody would care about what we'd have to say to begin with.  Until we finally see what we're been thinking for years appearing in headlines.  But overall, I'd definitely agree with you - we most likely don't make the best philosophers."
infp,3c8phb,Medaled,2,Tue Jul 7 02:44:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe not classic, logic-based philosophy. But philosophy is found in poetry and prose just as it is in philosophy textbooks. Philosophy can be abstract and idiosyncratic. It is just our way of seeing the world in different ways, and I think INFPs open mind and unique perspective definitely makes us philosophers."
infp,3c8phb,eyeenneffpee,2,Mon Jul 6 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"What makes a philosopher?  I'd argue that INFPs have shown they're at least as good at philosophy as any other type.  They just find different ways to present it.  Orwell wrote some remarkable essays, for example, but found much more success with his less direct works like allegories.  Across all the INFPs I know (and know of), that seems to be a common pattern.  If we want to say something, more often than not, instead of standing up and shouting it to the world, we'll sit back and put it in a novel, or a joke, or the lyrics to a song.  Why can't a philosopher use comedy as their medium, or music?  I don't accept that Louis CK or George Orwell or Bob Dylan are lesser philosophers than people whose biography calls them merely ""philosopher"".  Is Dylan the most musical philosopher, or the most philosophical musician?  Po-tay-to, Po-tah-to."
infp,3c8phb,KoenigAllant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:30:47 2015 UTC,"Well with all due respect, I don't know how much you know about philosophy. Conveying emotion and art is not what philosophy is about, just comparing Louis CK, Bob Dylan or even George Orwell (whose prose I really admire, but I don't think had a lot to do with the kind of philosophy we're discussing) is just wrong.  I strongly urge you to dip into some of the ''remarkable'' manifestations of philosophy, read Plato's The Republic, read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, read Wittgenstein's Tractatus.  Naturally the people you mentioned exercised philosophy, I think everyone is capable of doing it, even children. But I don't think any of them had any groundbreaking ideas, like the big names of philosophy have. Once you immerse yourself into the canon of philosophy, you understand what some people actually achieved in here, and it's mindblowing. Nothing that Louis CK or Bob Dylan could do on the same plane, naturally they respectively did mindblowing things with comedy and music."
infp,3c8phb,eyeenneffpee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:36:26 2015 UTC,"My copy of The Republic is on the shelf about 3 feet behind me.  :-)  Perhaps because I was born in the 20th century, I don't find it at all ""mindblowing"", though I admit that 2000 years ago it must have been.  It's not clear to me, but it almost sounds like you assume I think art is about conveying emotion.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The medium is not the message, and I don't buy into the notion that philosophy is only things that dead people wrote in Greek or German.  Just because the medium is a science fiction novel or a racy anecdote or the lyrics to a song doesn't change the message.  In fact, the most mindblowing messages I've heard tend to need to be hidden in such places, for they can't be spoken directly.  There's a lot in common between your old philosophers and my new ones.  They both invent allegorical stories to hide their ideas in, and have other people speak them.  I wonder if Plato's critics, back in the day, ever said:   This Plato is a decent storyteller but he's not a serious philosopher like Socrates was.  Everything he writes starts with ""So I went to this party with my pals...""!  That's not real philosophy."

There is very little mental regulation in our brains, and so it makes everything more open and observable. Picture an empty clearing and picture an crowded room. The clearing is an INFP's mental space, and the crowded room would be the confining space of socially normalizing factors. Concepts need to be explored, and I think INFP's enjoy doing that kind of work because its intellectually rewarding. As for artistic expression, it seems to go hand in hand with the capacities INFP's have for"

infp,3c9hpd,Empiricalbaker,2,Mon Jul 6 11:58:16 2015 UTC,"I do. Although I think it's possibly less of an INFP thing and more of a ""just some people"" thing. I can usually get a good read on people - I saw someone and basically fell for her before I ever talked to her. Three years later, we started talking more, and although I knew she was attractive from the moment I saw her, and knew she was fun from random events I saw she was at, I didn't realise until much later that she was someone I actually matched with.   I assumed it was just all physical, but I apparently saw something in that first meeting that made me think we'd actually work.  This could be confirmation bias, I suppose, but I like the idea of it, if nothing else."
infp,3c9hpd,travistravis,2,Mon Jul 6 13:04:21 2015 UTC,"i used to believe at love at first sight.  but the truth is, the emotions u are feeling right now is called attraction.  they are two different things. to sum it up :   attraction could happen as a one-way emotion. and usually because of the physical traits. thats why we could fall for someone at first sight without knowing the person first. not trying to say that ure only liked him/her because of the appearance, but physical traits led our minds to create a fantasy of him/her becoming our ideal partner. (it happened to me too lol ). attraction also could happen as a mutual emotion, but it is a different thing from a love. love only happen as a mutual emotion. you cant love someone without knowing them. thats a fact. love is all about accepting a single person, with his/her whole soul. you will learn about his/her dark side, yet you still accept them, because its also a part of him/her.   but to be honest, attraction could led to a love, if the chemistry is splendid :)  if u dont believe me, you can look the thorough definition elsewhere. google it up :)  for references, that is why Japanese people only says ""i like you"" to their GF/BF, no matter how close or perfect they are as a couple. after theyre married, then they will be able to say ""i love you"" :)"

I have only ever known one person who claimed they felt this way and had a long lasting relationship. For me, love at first sight is impossible because I have a very deep need to know a person well. I want to be as close as possible to someone before I can say that I love them. For this reason, I have never experienced love at first sight. However, I think this may be contributed in part to the pedestal INFP's tend to put under people in order to create a larger and much more grand version of that person. Idealizing someone is very easy to do."

infp,3c80qd,Ashlyme,2,Sun Jul 5 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"Why should going abroad and taking a break from all you've been through only be possible in your 20s?  Actually I think doing exactly this would be a great idea! It could distract you from weary thoughts, create room for yourself and all the things there are to explore (cultures, lifestyles, food! :], music, nature, your personality), it'll also help to forget about those daily responsibilities you had to deal with all these years. Why not take some time for yourself, charge some energy and get back energised and inspired on what you would like to achieve in your life. Maybe you'll find some ideas on future plans on your journey!  You talk about ""make things right again"". Now is your chance, not to change the past, but to shape your bright future, make things better - whichever attempt you make. :)"
infp,3c80qd,shelovestea,2,Sun Jul 5 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"I'm so annoyed with all the typos in my OP.  Thanks for your thoughts. But, I dunno... a couple of things: I work in international education, and one thing we tell students is that you shouldn't think that going abroad is going to be an escape from your problems. That doesn't work. But then, who said it doesn't? Maybe it does. As long as you treat those experiences (at least the service oriented ones) with respect, and not excuses to improve your own life and make your own narrative more ""interesting."" There's already a problem with young, hipster types thinking they have to go to rural China to ""make a difference"", but can't be bothered to go to rural Mississippi because it's not ""interesting enough."" I don't want to contribute to that. But then, I have other reasons for going abroad as well. I've done it before, I enjoyed it, I was a pretty OK teacher (I think.)   Or there's a language program...I always regretted that my language learning was cut short. I was well on my way to some pretty impressive language school credentials, but simply allowed myself to get side tracked. Next thing I know, I'm committed to a career and a marriage and all that previous ambition was no longer attainable. Until now. Potentially.   But the real doubt I have is this: I know why I'm doing it. On some primal level, I'm somehow convinced that I'm actually going to be able to go back in time and recreate my past, but fix all the mistakes. I even half expect to meet the original version of my wife out there...back before things went toxic for us. I know this sounds absurd...I logically understand that you can't do that...but that doesn't stop me from going through the motions.   But there's this, too: When I made my first attempt to do all this stuff, all this life planning in my 20s, I had reasons for those plans. I had concrete ideas. They didn't pan out. I either acted with too much hesitation, or acted too rashly (depending on the situation), and next thing I know, over a decade has passed...and it's over. To try again would seem to be nothing but a poor imitation of the original attempt, nothing but a reckless indulging of nostalgia gone wildly out of control."
infp,3c80qd,anima173,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:49:52 2015 UTC,"Well if you go back to teaching abroad in order to recreate the past, you could make a really indie movie about it. But one thing that's been helping me get over the past (thought I was going to get married like 3 different times but then got left, and then my mom died) but still appreciate it is to travel my unconscious instead of the external world. After all, it's your unconscious that hasn't let go of all that potential that didn't pan out. You could do it many ways. I do some lucid dreaming, which is very tough but one of the most amazing experiences you can have. Another is self-hypnosis,  which is much more accessible but also effective for talking to your subconscious. You can even just do visualization which doesn't require a trance. Anyhow, as an INFP I assume you are very aware of your feelings and you day dream a lot. This is good. You can harness that. So what you do with any of these tools is live out that past into as many different scenarios as you feel like living out. It's not enough to just think about the possibilities logically. You want to experience them vividly in the present so you feel all the feels. Follow it as far as it goes each time. Some times you'll feel a sense of closure but sometimes you'll be weirded out and disappointed by how boring it was. Either way, you'll help your emotional self come to a realistic acceptance of the situation.   Nothing in my life has turned out how I expected it to, but I'm happy. I think I'm happy because I'm no longer comparing my life to expectations. I'm just grateful for all the weirdness that has serendipitously happened. I'm not sure what it means, but I've grown to love the mystery. I hope you find yourself again.   Another exercise to try, imagine you are in the house that you grew up in, every little detail of it. You are walking through the yard, then the front door, then you make your way to your old bedroom. You find your self there as a little kid just playing. You sit down with your little kid self and have a talk. Your little self wants to know all kinds of things. Somethings are very fun to explain, somethings very hard. This one makes me cry sometimes but I always feel like I came full circle in my life story and that it was all very meaningful."
infp,3c80qd,anima173,2,Mon Jul 6 02:50:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I appreciate your advice. I may look into this as well. I'm sorry you've experienced the challenges you describe.

You know now what to do, how to do it better. Take small steps, set yourself little goals first. :)  I know what you mean by ""recreating your past"",  but it's good you know that it's not possible. Nonetheless you still have an influence on your future's past, if that makes sense... I mean, by tommorrow today will be yesterday and you create your past in this minute already!

I hate it so much, but it seems to be on repeat for me and I want it to stop. I'm going to try to give you the advice I would give myself.  I think the times when everything looks like its falling apart around us is where we can make the biggest changes. Change is one of life's  only certainties, and it doesn't have to be a bad thing. It's scary, but it's different. Life doesn't have to end after you turn 30, if you divorce, or after you drop a career path. You don't have to be a slave to your loans, to your past marriage, or anything in the past. Yo.ur thoughts are your thoughts alone. You can control them. Those thoughts can become your actions and you decide which ones you want to act on  It's easy to think we're the only one in the world who has this  problem we're going through, but the truth is... many people are going through the same situations. And people have made something of themselves in the past, and there will surely be more people in the future who will go through these things and turn out fine.  You decide who you want to be. It just takes that first step into the unknown. And then another and another. If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change where you stand. Life doesn't have to be filled with regret, just lessons to learn from.  I hope that helped a bit.."

I was playing a lot of MMO back in the day but my parents were worried about me getting addicted to video games, so they cut the internet at home. Without the mmo, i went to a computer store and picked up a cracked copy of Visual Basic 6, and started my coding journey.  Although long work hours often makes me rethink about my job a lot, but being able to show my work in front of thousands of customers is worth all the hard work. I gotta say i definitely don't code for fun as much as i'd love to anymore. But i will try to at least slowly finish my mobile game ideas over the next few months and years. I don't really have a deadline for those projects haha."
infp,3c6gwb,discova,3,Sun Jul 5 17:35:50 2015 UTC,I took an I T course at college on the recommendation of a friend. The course ended with a project that involved making a game in visual basic. I loved it. I went on to take computer science at Uni and graduated two years ago. I've been working in the industry a while now and enjoy the front end aspect of development alot. I find satisfaction in producing well designed modules I guess.
infp,3c6gwb,Happy-Moth,3,Sun Jul 5 08:40:22 2015 UTC,"As a graphic designer, I had a blast learning HTML5 / CSS3 / Some jQuery. Coding is like learning a new language, it is pretty interesting! :) However, I would rather focus on my graphic design work / illustration rather than jumping all-in into programmation. It is kinda hard to keep up with everything if you're not a full-time programmer.   It is great to know I can work more easily with programmers since I understand their reality, though. It is way easier for me to design clever websites with that background."
infp,3c6gwb,llzzies,2,Sun Jul 5 16:52:54 2015 UTC,"Very similar situation for me - I've been working as an in-house designer for a company for seven years. I was originally hired as a graphic designer with intermediate HTML/CSS knowledge. Turned out I was naturally inclined toward the web world and ended up vastly expanding that knowledge and collaborating with our IT team. Over the years, I've learned more JS and PHP and now work as Graphic & Web Developer, bridging the marketing and IT departments of the company - sort of the person who lets other designers know what our backend limitations are before the design gets to the programmer (or oftentimes me). I still prefer Photoshop and Illustrator though! Haha."

The sites that list ideal jobs by MBTI type are outdated/wrong IMO, as they don't seem to make the same link between programming and art that they make between writing and art.  At first it was web development, which I would definitely recommend for any INFP looking to get into programming. The mix of being able to apply artistic vision with basic programming concepts is perfect.  Then later on I discovered a love for 3d graphics, and landed a programming job at an AAA games studio. Safe to say that I wouldn't be where I am now without INFP traits, so it's definitely not always a bad thing as some would suggest."

Worst things: um... sometimes I can stare at a computer all day and not say a word to anyone if I so choose. That's on the developer though.  As for math,  I know a lot of programmers who say you only need algebra, but the fact is most non trivial programs will be with linear algebra (graphics and otherwise). Which requires at least calculus fundementals .  Bare minimum math skills would be calculus 2 with linear and discrete math, but you can substitute linear at and algebra with differential equations if you'd like."
infp,3c6gwb,Chizbang,3,Mon Jul 6 00:27:09 2015 UTC,"I absolutely adore programming. The feeling of being able to make whatever you want and literally being able to potentially change the world at the same time is an incredible feeling for me.   I started programming for the very first time at the age of 8 in Visual Basic using Visual Studio 2005... Good fun! I loved being able to make whatever I wanted and played around with lots of different concepts.  A year went by and I had my first breakdown at age 9 which exhausted me so much that I couldnt manage much at all anymore... Then around a year later i got a bit better and got back into VB again but alas, one year later I started the worst breakdown I've ever had. School was causing these breakdowns due to school just not being a suitable environment for me and along with the fact the school simply refused to understand my needs.  So thats when my Mom made the best decision of my life, to home educate me... Little did she know, this would entirely change the course of my future for the better. After leaving school, I started gaining more energy and began getting back into VB and then just one year later I discovered the wonderful world (Thanks to the help of my first mentor, I have everything to thank him for) of mobile app development with Objective C by which point I was 13.  The excitement was overwhelming, infact, the excitement was so extreme that I literally couldnt wait for learning. All these ideas were entering my head, ideas, concepts and lots of designs for apps I wanted to develop!!! I didnt want to wait for learning!  So while I continued to code with Objective C, I also started learning PHP and Lua around the same time. So, one year on from this, late 2011, by now I had developed a very crappy half functioning app for iOS 4 and had developed an extremely basic social network in PHP which basically didnt function.  I was so damn excited by the power and possibilities behind programming I couldnt stick with one project for more than 5 minutes and I was constantly worrying about why I was so bad at programming... By now it was 2012, I had made my first forum theme for MyBB along with a few basic plugins. This got me interested in developing my own forums from scratch as a little project which I ended up doing a half complete job of.  By now, I had imposters syndrome and felt pretty down about how slow I was progressing. I wanted to make slick, maintainable projects NOW! Not soon, not a little later, NOW! So, I was pretty worried besides the fact that all the amazing people around me telling me I would do fine and that I was doing great.   2013 comes and goes and I begin to see where I'm going wrong... Messy code, sloppy formatting, unreadable variable names and absolutely no planing behind my projects what so ever. I picked up a book on neat programming (Agile software development) and began reading, this was quite a fleet for me as I could see everything I was doing wrong and I started correcting it all.  So by now we are in early 2014, Im still writing bad code but the difference is that I am now organising things a little better which is making my projects more finish-able. A few more months go by and I discover the incredible world of AngularJS which accelerates my skills 10 fold. My first project I assign my self, from start to finish, is a CMS written from scratch with a backend of my own written in PHP along with the front end obviously being developed with Angular. I did it! I succeeded! A fully working blog written from scratch, I felt so empowered...  At this point, I thought it would be a good idea to put it on Github, so I did and began working on my very own portfolio with a similar system to the CMS I wrote. I then made a little text mini game with Angular and then progressed to writing my very first game in Lua.  That, again went great! I even had my first fork, man was I excited about that.  At this pont, we are at late 2014 in the thick of winter... I came up with this idea for a web app which started with a member based system. I begin work on a little login screen, nothing complex. A login screen turned into what is now the biggest project I have ever worked on. Its a dashboard style web app for managing information which weighs in currently at around 5000 lines of code and has the following features:  Modern UI design, membership system, permissions system, admin  dashboard, database management system allowing for backups and restores on demand, searchable databases, social media integration, tabbed menus, inline moderation for subjects, printable info about specific subjects and more! These are all things I couldnt have dreamt of doing a while ago... Now look where i am! But thats not all... I have far more planned than this, so itl only continue to grow.  To any of you guys thats finding it a bit difficult and love it, keep going... Keep doing it even if you have absolutely no idea what anything means, keep plowing through it and trying to grow your knowledge whenever you get the chance. You will get there eventually. :D"

infp,3c5q01,bedejeegee,14,Sun Jul 5 01:45:15 2015 UTC,"I totally get that.  Instead of perceiving myself as ""BlocMan"" I sometimes perceive myself as ""BlocMan as BlocMan,"" perhaps because its sometimes easier that way. I defer complete control and instead add a level of distance by asking, ""what you BlocMan do in this scenario?"" and then acting, instead of just acting.  I'll also add that in my darker times I found myself quite detached from reality; like I wasn't fully living because (cliche) life sucked and it hurt to face things head on. I find myself acting less now, but I can still relate.   Also, while writing this I had an interesting idea, I think. Althusser's theory of interpellation: that individuals are morphed into subjects i.e. I am not BlocMan, I am BlocMan the Writer, BlocMan the INFP, BlocMan the athlete, BlocMan the redditor and so on. Once interpellation occurs, an exchange of sorts happens between two people. We ask, ""what do you do for a living?"" to see how we can interpellate them, and then, after we have, we treat them a certain way. Ie. around a blue-collar we might be more comfortable swearing, talking about 'manly' stuff, talking sports etc. Whereas, with a white-collar worker we're more likely to talk about our education, authors, writing and so on. In short, this interpellation informs how we interact with this person and how we expect them to act with us.    Now, my question is: by acting out a character of ourselves are we interpellating ourselves as ourselves? The individual (ourselves) in this scenario would be morphed into a subject of ourselves. Like we're trying to copy ourselves and put ourselves into a category because we don't how to act as authentically ourselves. It's all so odd because we are ourselves, but yet we seem to sometimes ask, ""what would I do in this scenario?"" which is a silly question, because we could just act and find out.   Hopefully this is helpful. If not…it was fun for me to think out loud."

infp,3c5q01,ZeroZeroQuatre,11,Mon Jul 6 17:25:03 2015 UTC,"That's an absolutely normal feeling, especially for INFPs, cause we're damn good in doing it. Jung called it the ""persona"", it's a mask we wear in social situations. The persona can have several purposes, and people can have plenty too. They can have one at work, where they'll keep a low profile (in order to improve the chance for promotion or avoid conflict, for example); they can have another one around family, like a gay teenager behaving straight (cause he doesn't want to upset his relatives); they can have one around friends too, where they'll be outgoing (imagine an INFP pretending to be an extrovert); and they can have in relationships. One of the main purposes of the persona is also to protect the ego, your true identity (in the case of an abused child for example, that may need a persona as a shelter, or to cope with traumatic experiences). And as you figured it out, if the persona is worn too often or too long, it creates a feeling of rupture with who or what you truly are or want to be, even more if you convince yourself that this fake personality is your true self, thus rejecting your ego. Such self deception is unhealthy, and at worst dangerous.   So no worries, we all do it, all the time. And it's normal and required in society. But we should be aware of it. And nobody should be forced to do it all the time."

Generally, the fact that these people are willing to make the most out of each and every day, and also try to entertain other people in doing so is something I respect. I just have to tell you a little story about some old friends.  You've probably never heard of BYBH (Back Yard Bone Heads) but those were my friends, and they were indeed striving to be a ""stunt crew"", just like Jackass and Nitro Circus. Here is a video of one of my closest friends I've ever had, his name is Mike, and he made it on Top 20 Most Shocking Dumb Dudes 6, as number 8 out of 20. Watch the video to see why, but that's NOTHING compared to the other stuff these guys have done, the kind of things that get taken off YouTube the same day it gets uploaded and accounts banned every time. So let me tell you about Mike. In the video, he says ""Why am I so stupid, people, why?"" and I want to punch him in the face for that because he's one of the most caring and intellectually gifted people I've ever known. So why is he doing this then, you ask. My friend Mike is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, who either has to be completely doped up and zombified, or do a bunch of drugs and end up like he is in the video. On top of that, this same person had to watch the cops kill his dad in front of him when he was a little kid, because his dad was beating up his mom so bad. My friend is extremely troubled and he lives every day like it's his last, because sometimes it's not only a possibility, it's a probability.   I guess the main point of what I'm trying to say here, is that self-destruction is self-destruction. Yeah, maybe these Jackass and Nitro Circus guys are having a fun time and they're paying the bills, people get their kicks out of watching it but from what I've observed, people often resort to such extreme measures because of a lack of meaning and purpose in their lives, or they're just extremely troubled. Not all of them are like this, they could just be some ESTP that feels like they need that kinda excitement and it's what they thrive on.   These people risk their lives and well-being for the entertainment of their fans. I respect that. What I don't respect is self-destruction, you can live happy and make the most out of every day without doing things that can either kill you or severely injure you. Let's say your friends were involved in things like that. How happy would the fans be if they died doing a stunt? How would their family members or loved ones feel? Would it make them happy and inspire them to live for the moment?  Feel free to disagree. I'm in a rush though so this didn't come out the way I wanted it to, I didn't proofread or edit so it might not be very coherent and for that I apologize.

Find some time in the day to be with yourself and do something that makes you happy. Take charge of your day and shape it into something that makes you feel happy. I promise it works :)"

Other people are just as complex as you, and usually have reasons for not saying yes besides ""you are literally the worst person ever, no!"" I'm sure you've said no to people.

infp,3c4314,sheranandran,2,Sat Jul 4 16:06:05 2015 UTC,"I find that a lot of Te comes in whenever I truly try to apply my strengths. It is the grounding factor to my INFP imagination and intellect. As INFPs, we take a lot of pleasure in formulating ideas and thus conversations that are both very intellectually engaging AND emotionally compelling. However, when others disagree with my ideas, or when it comes time to execute the ideas we have discussed, I have to rely heavily on Te to keep all the different parts of my group working well together, especially myself--negotiating in a calm, reasoned manner, staying focused on delivering results rather than getting lost in endless R&D. Essentially, I view Te as how an extreme Idealist can self-actualize by bringing their ideas to life and to others.   I feel that I especially need to rely on Te as a 1w2 in the Enneagram--known for being extremely impassioned in their convictions. At the worst of 1w2, I become aggressively moralizing and excessively outraged at the perceived misconduct of others. Te is the way I can maintain a respectful disagreement with someone rather than escalating emotionally as an INFP."
infp,3c4314,Jeniluna,2,Sat Jul 4 19:46:06 2015 UTC,"More ISTJish than INTJish for sure. Ni is kind of its own thing. Though to say I have ""sufficiently developed [my] Te"" would be a stretch. There's always much more to growing to do.  I grew up in a very Te-centric family, so I've always had access to the problem solving and optimization aspects of it. But I'm a lot more organized now than I was before. In many ways, I'm more organized than my ISTJ dad, though that's partly because he's retired and has fewer external pressures to deal with.  I'm still not that comfortable with giving people orders, mainly because the Fi side of me wants to give people the freedom to follow their own path. So I have a lot of conflict around that and it slows me down."
infp,3c4314,redearth,2,Sat Jul 4 23:36:13 2015 UTC,"Confidence: yes and it feels very good. People notice it!  Both.   ISTJ - I stay on top of getting bills paid, keeping my apartment pleasant and clean, and make spreadsheets for large decisions. The ESTJ-style Te shines through when I can talk informally or give a presentation about something I care a lot about -- what I said has been simmering in my mind, worked and re-worked through in my head and in writing for more than a decade, so being able to talk about it intelligently, rationally, and compassionately makes me feel good.  INTJ - When people offer up ideas or I read a research-heavy book, my INTJ-style Te kicks into gear. I begin evaluating the arguments separately and how/whether they fit together and figure out where the missing gaps are. Like above, this Te can 'look' and 'sound' more ENTJ when I can talk or present my evaluations and again, it has to be something I care about and have been thinking about for years.  My Te is highly developed because most of my family are NTs. It was painful to have my values (and search for values) ignored as I was growing up. Now, my strong Te helps me in almost all aspects of my life, including evaluating and processing my feelings, as well as helping other people with their feelings without the sense of co-dependency or being overwhelmed."
infp,3c4314,dry_russell,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:20:14 2015 UTC,"I was friend with an ISTJ throughout highschool and we would study together, he would always show me to order my tasks very logically, generally I had trouble deciding the order in which I will get things done, I would always do the most 'fun' or interesting stuff first regardless of their importance and end up fluttering between multiple tasks.  People with developed Te tend to take information and categorize it objectively and make precise decisions based on this. An INFP who is 'developed' in this will be more logical in their organization when they know it is important to be. For example, choosing to pay a bill or applying for something a month in advance when you have the money to avoid the possibility of forgetting."

For me, I think my insecure attachment comes from those habits of thinking and not from actual experiences with my parents.

As a previously very mentally unstable  INFP that is now in a stable, happy telationship, the key for me has been in finding an MBTI type that suits me (INFP with strong Ti), and developing communication skills with compromise on both ends.  I am happy now because someone else had both the capacity and patience to work together with me on developing a happy relationship based on unconditional love.  It would have helped me feel happier about myself if I had had a secure relationship with one of my parents, but despite it all, it really came down to finding the right person and hard work."

I was pretty depressed at the time, learning deeply about my own role in sabotaging all my relationships.  I am both anxiously and avoidantly attached.  I'm also an INFP.

After I got past wanting to look like a particular type of musician all the time, later on in high school I preferred to be a walking, talking reminder that holding on to our childlike side is a viable choice-- lots of colors, odd shapes and patterns.  It was a lot of fun finally letting go of caring what anyone thought of me (including friends or romantic interests), and just wanting people to be amused or curious when they saw me.  These days I tend to stick with the slacker look, in the most non-threatening way possible.

Khánh Ly - Nối vòng tay lớn   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqQPcaLR-ik  Khanh Ly left Vietnam in 1975. She's been making music in the US ever since, most of it is overproduced drek. Only her early stuff in collaboration with Trinh Cong Son recorded prior to 1975 is worth listening to. She has also made every effort to sweep Youtube of her early recordings in Vietnam (which I assume were not copyrighted, therefor provide no royalties for her bank account) and re-released the material in updated studio format. It sucks.  Interestingly, Trinh Cong Son refused to flee Vietnam after the war. He lived there the rest of his life.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinh_Cong_Son"

I look for the cover art to identify the early stuff. I remember what the cassette cases looked like.  You're more than welcome. I'm so glad when western ears are able to appreciate something so different from what they're used to.  BTW Khanh Ly's diction is amazing, superlative. These were very well educated people. Vietnamese is a difficult language. Her phrasing and pronunciation are perfection.  I would say the same for Алла Сумарокова. Her command of the subtleties of diction  and delivery are a wonder.  I'm looking for more original recording Khanh Ly/Trinh Cong Son for you on youtube. Most of it is re-issued re-mastered crap. The original stuff is becoming very hard to come by.   This re-compilation sounds to be largely original recordings which have been repackaged with a different cover art:  Khánh Ly - Hát Cho Quê Hương Việt Nam 6 - Thu Âm Trước 1975   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ3DZoEShww"

I did that with one of my best friends after hanging out far too much. When I did that with my best friend, I decided that it was probably the one time I listened to others for advice, heeding it as well, and finding out it was for the better. She wasn't happy about it, but we're still friends and recognize our differences now. Being friends with her is weird now, though, so expect that. I don't know how to help past that point."
infp,3c2zvz,olypenrain,3,Sat Jul 4 08:21:05 2015 UTC,"Alright, yeah that feels like it's the best option. But I don't want to cause troubles - conflict wouldn't help me much. I travelled a bit last year, and during that time he barely kept in contact. He said part of him hates me, but I'm not sure why and neither is he. I guess all I can do is quietly sink into my own world until I have enough money to move out and start my own life, as scary as that is. Thanks for the advice <3 life is tough :/"
infp,3c2zvz,Meenjedit,3,Sat Jul 4 08:29:51 2015 UTC,"Those kind of people, who hate without justification are the worst. That is toxic behavior and can help you to places you don't want to go, don't deserve to go. They can make you hate yourself for no good reason (and the worst part they don't give a reason).   I have a similiar 'friend' (who is also toxic in league and towards me as support alot.  I don't enjoy playing anymore), he sort of made me hate myself and I hate him for it but then again don't hate or blame him. I still can't, I blame myself for letting him in and stay so long. I can't blame him because he is so insecure, has such an anxiety for people leaving him that I almost suspect he is a narcicist. I can't change him, he won't let me. But I let him change me. Now I know I can say: ""No, I won't let you. I have my views and you have yours, let's agree to disagree and go our own ways.""   It has been a year where I have a lot less contact (we were in the same class, he had to do another year over again while I didn't). And it has been a good year, so much more free and without all the hate. It gave me time to work the self-hate out of me, to build myself up without a 'friend' who did it for me. The contact I have with him has also improved, I now know what I will let in and what I won't. So I can tolerate him more because I can tolerate myself more. It has been a learning process that I am sort of happy I already went through.   Sorry for the rant, my advice is that you minimise the contact with your 'friend' and hang out more with other friends. It is more than allright to shut those toxic people out. You are worth so much better relationships. Don't hate yourself for the damage of another, it is their own fault they lost a potential true friend. Man, I am still PJSalt about this.   Stay strong my friend!  I like this quote by Daniell Koepke about toxic people alot:  You dont ever have to feel guilty about removing toxic people from your life. Its one thing if a person owns up to their behavior and makes an effort to change. But if a person disregards your feelings, ignores your boundaries, and continues to treat you in a harmful way, they need to go."
infp,3c2zvz,shelovestea,4,Sat Jul 4 09:07:22 2015 UTC,"I read this  slowly, which is odd because I usually rush everything I read and I want to say thank you. Thank you for telling me your own story, I can relate to it a lot. As far as league I often wonder why I even play it anymore, it used to be fun and we were a good duo, now it's just a mess and I hate it. I understand what you said about blame, I often want to blame him for being the way he is but I guess I agree with what you figured out - it's bad that I've let him in so long and let him hurt me so much. It's hard to agree to disagree when he just wants to argue and be right, and I just don't have the energy anymore. I guess this is all stuff I need to learn too, I have poor boundaries I guess.. I want to make the people around me happy even if it costs me my own happiness, I've let this go on for years now and it's worn me out so much. Is it rude to set boundaries and limits? I know that's an odd question, but I worry that by locking people out or creating walls it will ruin some relationships or make people suddenly feel hated - especially if they've been shitting all over me for a while.. It's an interesting point you made, about having a friend who sort of encouraged( not sure if the right word) the self hate. I guess I have carried self hate a little for a while and it's never really made sense to me, perhaps this is where it's coming from? I feel suffocated in this friendship, as if I should just be some small weak unsuccessful piece of shit person that he can just abuse for the fun of it until he feels better about himself. It hurts. I'm ranting heh. Thank you for the advice, I'll try to accept that it's okay to limit the amount of toxic people in my life.  Thanks, I'll try. You be strong too okay? -hugs-  I'd not heard that quote before, I like it."
infp,3c2zvz,shelovestea,5,Sat Jul 4 09:18:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for you, that your relationship isn't the same as it was in the beginning - easy going and fun. Usually I say ""people change and sometimes you need to let go "",  but just because your friend doesn't know the reasons for his feelings and behaviour, doesn't mean there is no reason at all. Maybe the reasons could help you to move on and not see the fault in you.   I wonder, if your housemate is dealing with something inside he didn't tell you about... seems like he's quite discontent and overacts it with his ""huge ego"", seeks for mistakes others make, while he's actually, maybe not knowingly, upset about mistakes he makes, or did in the past and by putting others down, he doesn't feel as imperfect himself.  Please don't let others influence your mood in a negative way... if it's a good day, don't let anyone else ruin it. Just because those people are having a bad day, or can't even be happy, doesn't mean you have to suffer their behaviour. And if they are that toxic, don't be afraid to distance yourself from them emotionally and ""physically"", because they are not even trying to contribute to your happiness. So why should you let them have an influence on your life at all.  Have a great weekend, with lots of love and sunshine! :)"

However, do not venture into the land of masters degrees or doctoral degrees, for those people call our magic fraud and try to scientifically deduce something undeducable like the brilliant human mind.  /s  I kinda swim against the current regarding tests. I think they're a great first step to finding out more about yourself. This one is just a good one to take once to help narrow down your GENERAL area for judging functions, I think. An INFP on there could easily be an ISFP too, or even an INFJ. However, tests like that I think help narrow down third letter of any person's function (an xxFx or xxTx is probably gonna stay consistent, but only in the regard of T or F). Beyond that, especially for E/I, S/N, or P/J, you'll need to get into the beautiful world of functions.  Before you do anything else, go ahead and take that 16personalities test if you haven't yet. If you want, then I can try and help you find out your type (whether on public here or you can PM me), or whatever. Just reply/pm me with a list of all your credentials to your bank account, the name of your first pet, and your mother's maiden name.  Seriously though, if you'd like me to help, I'd be more than happy to! I'm no ""expert"" on any of the nitty gritty stuff (if such a thing actually exists for MBTI), but I'm good at narrowing stuff down, function wise. I'm much better at finding other people's types than my own though, which probably took me so long to realize that I'm an ENFJ and feel comfortable and at home in that (at the same time, it's just four letters that really don't mean anything, so)."

If I do mention something to him about feeling sad or whatever, I don't expect much sympathy, but he cares a surprising amount. I've definitely had times where I mention to him how sad I am and while he isn't the type to pat me on the back as I cry, he actually helps a surprising amount. And he helps in a different way than anyone else. He really brings out a rational response to the emotions I experience. If I'm heartbroken, for example, he really helps me to move on because that's the rational thing to do.  Sometimes we give each other really heartfelt gifts and that's really nice. Just having him ask to hang out is enough for me to know that he cares and appreciates our friendship. I have more fun with him than anyone else.  Seeing your comment makes me so scared to lose him.

infp,3c2kte,bezald,5,Sat Jul 4 08:25:00 2015 UTC,"Hardest part is that he gets annoyed by my emotional outbursts sometimes and struggles to understand it. He doesnt understand his own feelings all that much either so sometimes we have arguments because of that. But for the most part we're perfect. Been together years now and don't see it ending anytime soon. The best part / what keeps us together is how easy it is to talk to eachother. We're very honest people. We're also very calm. So even when I'm drained or he is, we can still talk to eachother and know that we're safe being vulnerable with eachother."
infp,3c2kte,LittleFeetsies,2,Sat Jul 4 08:31:31 2015 UTC,Seems like communication is a very big part of keeping the relationship going. My INTP also struggles with my emotional approaches sometimes and I get upset when they only try to deal with it in a logical way and not try to see it my way. So glad to hear you two are still together and strong.
infp,3c2kte,LittleFeetsies,2,Sat Jul 4 08:09:10 2015 UTC,"ugh yeah the logical approach of an INTP to emotions can be infuriating sometimes, they are such stubborn people too -.- Great people dont get me wrong, but stubborn and difficult at times xD communication is very important, if you have a silent INFP or INTP you have a problem ;)  I'm lucky that we are, there were quite a few arguments in the beginning, we had to negotiate a lot just to reach a decent level of understanding :P"
infp,3c2kte,bezald,2,Sat Jul 4 16:56:38 2015 UTC,"well, INFPs very often mistype as INTPs so keep that in mind when considering responses or googling this pairing.  TRUE longterm INFP-INTP relationships are pretty rare. it seems to help most in relationships when we share thinking and feeling functions and with INTPs we don't share either. we kind of live in parallel worlds inside our respective heads."
infp,3c2kte,CritSrc,0,Sun Jul 5 00:04:31 2015 UTC,"well, INFPs very often mistype as INTPs   That is if their values are drawn to things IXTPs are drawn to by by curiosity."
infp,3c2kte,bezald,3,Sat Jul 4 05:40:34 2015 UTC,it's because people think Ti= all-purpose logic and Fi=incapable of logic
infp,3c2kte,CritSrc,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:54:02 2015 UTC,Which is weird because it is essential to NTJs.
infp,3c2kte,bezald,2,Sat Jul 4 08:01:55 2015 UTC,"well, dom-Fi is demonized mainly"
infp,3c2kte,CritSrc,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:05:26 2015 UTC,"So is Fe, it's like having values is a bad thing. But I might have to point to tumblr as a reason Fi is demonized on the net."
infp,3c2kte,bezald,3,Sat Jul 4 08:12:00 2015 UTC,"And I might have to point out that reddit's obsession with tumblr is outsized and somewhat hypocritical as reddit itself is incredibly emphatic, hostile and even deeply aggressive when it comes to concerns that affect them directly.  At least a lot of tumblr has a sense of humor about itself, i can't really say the same for most of reddit.  And no way is Fe demonized like Fi is... I've seen polls on other MBTI sites about what function they hate the most and it's always Fi. Fi only makes sense to the person who has it, so of course people generally don't like it."
infp,3c2kte,CritSrc,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:18:55 2015 UTC,Unfortunately this is just as true.
infp,3c2kte,bezald,2,Sat Jul 4 08:22:41 2015 UTC,"yeah, the nature of Fi is that it's really only fully understood by that particular user... Fe is more directly useful to everyone, you know?"
infp,3c2kte,CritSrc,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's very much based on the individual."
infp,3c2kte,ediblespry,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:34:05 2015 UTC,"Same, INFP (f) with INTP (m). The biggest thing I struggle with is not taking his mega quiet thinking moods personally. He can be super affectionate, fun and engaging one minute (Ne function), and then minutes later become completely engulfed in his own thoughts (Ti). This sends my delicate Fi into overdrive, wondering what I did wrong, whether or not he's doubting our relationship, etc. Honestly, it's profoundly emotionally draining. I'm at a point where I need to explain to him - with as much logical clarity as possible :P - that if something IS wrong, I need to trust that he'll tell me exactly what it is at the soonest opportunity. Otherwise I don't know how to read his silence, and my sensitivity to his noticeable shifts in mood will invariably make me worry that something is ""wrong""; because, in my own world, going from hot to cold always means that I'm upset about something."
infp,3bzafx,EpicChiguire,3,Fri Jul 3 10:40:32 2015 UTC,Good luck :) j'espère que ça va aller
infp,3bzafx,nothingneverever,2,Fri Jul 3 17:19:15 2015 UTC,Good luck! You can do it. (:
infp,3bzafx,woodennature,2,Fri Jul 3 11:00:51 2015 UTC,Thanks! Already out. I hope I answered everything correctly.
infp,3bzafx,woodennature,2,Fri Jul 3 13:30:10 2015 UTC,Don't worry about it. I'm sure you did your best.
infp,3bzafx,catxing,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:33:14 2015 UTC,"I read that if you write a positive message down to yourself before you begin, like ""You can do it!"" your overall score will go up. It helps reinforce a positive mindset going in, and you are less likely to suffer from negative test taking anxiety. Who knows - in the future this could pull a B+ test to an A."
