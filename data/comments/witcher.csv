witcher,3dxwcu,AlphaEnder,17,Mon Jul 20 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"At least Dawnbreaker had a unique effect on undead creatures that, as far as I know, no other weapon or spell will have. The Daedric weapons were pretty good about being legitimately unique. Off the top of my head, there was the mace that both drained stamina and cast soul trap, and the magic deflecting shield. I had a Mage character and used the Sanguine Rose and Jabberwock pretty extensively. On the other hand, when the Jarl of Whiterun gives you that weapon ""from his personal armory"" like its some kind of unique, powerful thing, it's pretty disappointing to find its on par or worse compared to something you could craft for cheap."

witcher,3dxwcu,TheImmortalLS,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:23 2015 UTC,"Most of the Daedra weapons were pretty good in design, and fit the lore well, too. Molag Bal is all about domination, and his mace weakens the foe with each hit and eventually dominates their soul. Dawnbreaker reflects Meridia's hate for the undead. Wabbajack reflects Sheogorath's wild and unpredictable personality. Mephala's blade has an interesting upgrade mechanic that suits her affinity for murder. But then you have Peryite's shield which blocks spells. Awesome upgrade, but why's it connected to Peryite? And Mehrunes' Razor's unique enchantment is just lazy."

And the differences between the weapons and armour (in stats) was something you really noticed. 30% protection against swords instead of 20%? That's a chance to survive one more hit! 25 damage instead of 15? Wow, now I can kill a Goblin in two hits, or even one if I land a critical..."
witcher,3dxwcu,Mandarion,16,Mon Jul 20 14:39:15 2015 UTC,"Why not make all the ""legendary"" weapons relevant to endgame by attaching a perk system like Destiny's guns have but tied to character level instead of usage?   So you find the Mythic Axe of Smiting or some such and it's listed as a max level weapon but you are still able to wield it and as your level increases the axe becomes better (unique effects, increased stats, etc) because your character is becoming more skilled."

witcher,3dxwcu,478431188447,10,Mon Jul 20 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"BS. Oblivion was filled with diverse and strong Weapons as Quest Rewards. The problem there was that they were levelled according to the level you had when finishing the quests, which meant you had to wait until you were medium-high level yourself or you'd get a crappy version of them. Except for the ones that were actually in any way ""hyped"" - those were mostly daedric artifacts and they all lived up to the hype.   Skyrim has the problem that Crafting is so overpowered that if you invest some points in it you'll never find anything better than the stuff you make yourself. It still doesnt suffer from the problem you described though."

witcher,3dxwcu,Macismyname,14,Mon Jul 20 15:34:47 2015 UTC,"That's why I don't understand the reward leveling system in Elder Scrolls. As you level up your long blade, for instance, you will do more and more damage with your long blades. You'll always do more damage with a rusty iron short sword at level 100 than a daedric longsword at level 10, or whatever the base is, even though the base stats for the daedric item are much better. At the very least, why not have a similar effect happen to a weapon's magic properties as you level up your magic skills? The current system they have just ensures your God Killing Sword of Ultimate Destruction won't give a bandit a paper cut in five levels."

witcher,3dxwcu,BonTonVon,6,Mon Jul 20 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"Should make a mod that all the unique swords scale with your level - 5 or something. That way you could ALWAYS use them but if you find a normal non-unique sword that's better, you could use that for around 2-3 levels and then return to the unique one.  Also the combat redesign mod in witcher 2 did solve this problem as well in a way. Instead of having sword damage increase and things, almost every sword had the same stats. That way you could use whatever you want.  I'm interested what the community would make once the modding tools are released."
witcher,3dxwcu,zelin11,11,Mon Jul 20 15:41:09 2015 UTC,"It could be easily fixed. Most RPG just use a system where weapons and armors have level tied to them as well as different stats that are increased depending on how good you want them to be:  I.e lvl1 weapon does 20 dmg while lvl 15 weapon does 150 dmg.  It could be super easily fixed by NOT HAVING LEVELS AND FIXED STATS TIED TO A WEAPON.   Solution? MAYBE MAKE DAMAGE DEPENDENT ON YOUR CHARACTERS LEVEL AND ATTRIBUTES. Seriously, why is this not a thing? All you need on weapons and armors are different multipliers.  I.e You begin with a small sword that gives you increased attackspeed and critical percentage but only provides 75% damage.  Later on you get an ancient cool sword from a King that is quite big (the sword, not the king) , so it lowers attackspeed with 15% but it deals 10% more damage than normal (damage is set according to player level and attributes remember), it gives 15% extra cold damage and can also do some other cool shit. It's also way more durable due to that it's made out of some cool material iunno.  This way a weapon is never out of date, you could switch back to your first weapon if you want a bit more attackspeed or something and it won't totally suck shit, and ""legendary"" weapons WILL ACTUALLY BE LEGENDARY AND NOT DISCARDED 3 MINUTES AFTER YOU GOT IT BECAUSE IT'S 2 LEVELS BELOW THE SWORD YOU CURRENTLY GOT EQUIPPED.  /end of rant.  Sorry, I just hate level system on equipment when they're not needed. It totally makes sense in WoW imo but for a game like witcher or skyrim (ooh an ancient badass sword that's been buried for 200 years in a crypt, better sell it for 20 gold) just annoys the shit out of me.  //EDIT I also hate it due to you check a store at lvl1 that has a lvl1 shit weapons it (in witcher for example). Lets say they got a ""Iron longsword"" it does 0.00001 damage and totally sucks. 25 levels later you go back to the same vendor and check his goods, now he got lvl25 Iron longswords that does 280 damage for some fucking reason, it's supposed to be the same kind of sword isn't it! WHY DIDN'T YOU HAVE THEM EARLIER, and don't try to evade it by saying that levels is just an arbitrary thing, it represents how you get stronger, I still got that lvl1 sword that does basically NO damage, explain that! Crap vendors selling me shit gear."

Then the storm stops, and they are now trapped in the new ship.  These monster, magic, and humanity itself, all come from other worlds and just got thrown into this one by accident."

witcher,3dxwcu,ozman51,3,Mon Jul 20 15:08:58 2015 UTC,That sword I kept for a good while it was a pretty good upgrade for me.  Once I could craft my enhanced ursine steel sword then it went bye bye.
witcher,3dxwcu,Dredly,2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:28 2015 UTC,This sword was actually good and useful to me.

I sold the armor back to the chick that made it, sold the God Killing sword back to the guy that made it and this sword to the first blacksmith I found... meanwhile I'm using an axe that I found off a bandit that does 20 more damage and a silver sword that I found some random vendor had that is randomly generated... the loot really needs to be scaled WAY differently."

witcher,3dxwcu,Chiefhammerprime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:18 2015 UTC,"And that's why I think witcher 3 would be better without levels.  Of course they would've had to replace it with something to simulate progress, but levels, in the classical sense are outdated."
witcher,3dxwcu,MarshmellowPoot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, say what you want about the first witcher, at least they did this mostly right.  Aerondight was far better than the rune swords you could craft before getting it."
witcher,3dxwcu,NotPaulieWalnuts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. However there's a long time (act 2-4) where you run around wearing the same armor, using the same swords and once you've reached the end of act 4 and the beginning of act 5 you get drowned in new weapons. I could've replaced Aerondight within 2 hours after receiving it. And I was forced to replace the Mahakam Rune Sihil within an hour after receiving it. I feel like you should've gotten both in act 3 instead."
witcher,3dxwcu,Endyo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:49 2015 UTC,"That's true, although I'd have moved something else up before Aerondight rather than making it non-endgame gear.  Given the circumstances in which it was acquired, it feels more special than any of Geralt's other weapons, which makes it sad that the other end-game silver sword had better stats in Witcher 2."
witcher,3dxwcu,savantfool,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:18 2015 UTC,Agreed. I refused to use the Moonblade/Dyable in Witcher 2 and kept the Mahakam Rune Sihil and Aerondight for as long as feasible because they just looked better.

witcher,3dxwcu,nstablen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"I held onto it for awhile because I thought at some point in the story, Crach would ask me about it and not having the sword would result in some sort of story twist.   Then I got sick of looking at it and dismantled it for parts."

witcher,3e2qbx,autritortue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:22 2015 UTC,Just one button to turn it on or off will be enough. CDPR are the same guys who redid the voice acting (or atleast added more content) for the first Witcher game. I am sure a button for HUD toggle will be a small thing which will be easy to provide. An UBISOFT game (Far Cry 4) has this.

This is nice to have in any game, but it's a must have for a game like Witcher 3. I'm just playing through Guild Wars 2 for the first time (and loving it) and have mapped the HUD Toggle to X because I use it that often."

witcher,3e0bx5,07jonesj,8,Tue Jul 21 11:39:15 2015 UTC,"While there is nothing wrong with it, I think it's pretty damn impressive that the game (and the novels) can inspire paternal/maternal (paternal in Geralt's case, but I'm talking about the player) feelings in you towards Ciri. It certainly has in me, and while I recognise she's attractive, I wouldn't be able to fap to her."

Eventho you know and accept the fact that Ciri is a nonexistant fictional character you can still bear feelings towards her that prevent you from being attracted to her, despite it being completely natural. The fact that Sapkowski and CDPR managed to make and sustain this feeling towards a fictional character is extremely impressive."

If I am in rural area I can switch on quite few effects and still run quite smoothly  Also if I died and load save, load times (from HDD) increased immensely."

That said, I've found that it's completely changed my play style for the better - I've spent all evening taking things more slowly, consulting the map only when I need to (as a witcher would I guess) and actually looking in front of me for the place I need to go. The only thing I've left on are mine and the enemy's health bars and the underwater breath gauge.  I've also turned down the soundtrack so that it's almost inaudible which, combined with the removal of the HUD has completely changed the experience for me.  Probably an obvious thing for most, but removing all this excess and stripping the game back to its purest form means I can actually 'see' the world. I hadn't noticed things like shooting stars, raindrops on the camera or even the fact that distant objects are really there, and can be reached. Until now.

witcher,3e0bu0,wolscott,9,Tue Jul 21 00:10:29 2015 UTC,"I have been playing completely hudless for at least a dozen hours now.  The only things I've left on are location names and update text, so that if I stumble into a new mission, i know what to look for in the quests page. Combat is quite exciting when you aren't watching health bars and calculating your moves based on them. I don't even know what level my enemies are, which makes me fight super smart, using the best tools of the Witcher trade to may advantage.   Not having the minimap is really the biggest thing though. It makes searching areas with Witcher Senser much more engaging and less of a methodical ""search the circle on the minimap"" deal.   Also, the controller vibrates any time the medalion vibrates, which means, with no hud or minimap, a vibrating controller often signals that you should look around with your witcher senses.   Your medallion will also let you know when you stamina is refilled, which means, even without a visible stamina bar, you can know when you sign is up during a fight."
witcher,3e0bu0,Erratus,4,Tue Jul 21 02:17:38 2015 UTC,That's how I'm going to play on my 2nd playthrough. My eyes were stuck on that circle on the minimap man.
witcher,3e0bu0,Flare_TM,4,Tue Jul 21 10:16:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds really immersive from what you've said, like you're really out in the wilderness, might have to give it a try!"
witcher,3e0bu0,droonick,4,Tue Jul 21 00:18:10 2015 UTC,"I just tried it a while ago myself. it really changes the way you navigate areas. Like I look at the big-map for a long while studying my route, and then apply it to a hudless screen. I'm actually LOOKING at things now, like roads, that castle far away, etc.   I'm liking it so far.   Also, fighting without HP bars on everything is also a gamechanger, especially knowing I'm on deathmarch. I'm more careful when I fight. It feels like I'm playing on a completely different difficulty."
witcher,3e0bu0,Hombremaniac,4,Tue Jul 21 13:44:25 2015 UTC,"Well written. I just don't know if I would touch the music volume...it's so damn good!  Btw as /u/Anacra mentioned below, try this camera mod https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLjyYE44A7Y.  It really looks more immersive when your camera is closer to your witcher.  Btw we really need no hud option in game menu and maybe even option to zoom camera closer to Geralt."
witcher,3e0bu0,Flying_Scorpion,2,Tue Jul 21 07:27:07 2015 UTC,How do you turn off the HUD but still have your health bar displayed?
witcher,3e0bu0,Flying_Scorpion,4,Tue Jul 21 08:04:42 2015 UTC,"It allows that in the HUD options (possibly only since the 1.07 update?) and by default, this part usually fades in and out depending on whether you're fighting or not. So allowing it still means you spend the most part of the game without it."
witcher,3e0bu0,HarleyQuinn_RS,2,Tue Jul 21 09:21:24 2015 UTC,Thanks!
witcher,3e0bu0,Tyranos_II,3,Tue Jul 21 10:57:05 2015 UTC,Turn off all the HUD aspects in the Options but leave the Witcher Medallion and Health Bar on.
witcher,3e0bu0,starcruizah,4,Tue Jul 21 10:21:21 2015 UTC,I hope someone creates a mod like there was for Skyrim. So the combat-related HUD elements only show in combat and compass is only displayed when you're sprinting.

Yes, you can switch it off in the menu, but I often need it on, if only for a second (spot something on the minimap, check your quest marker, etc.) and going back into the menu every time is far too clunky.  So PLEASE, make it happen. Make it a bindable key. To be honest, I'm surprised that I haven't been able to find a mod for this yet."

witcher,3e0bu0,Der_Jaegar,3,Tue Jul 21 12:31:17 2015 UTC,"Would it be hard to mod this in? Just add a trail thing (I'm thinking similar to following scents) in game where the suggested path to objective is. Or maybe just an arrow pointing in the same direction the minimap would have to represent Geralts natural sense of direction. I don't mod nor do I know much about mods, but I hope something like this is feasible."

I played without the mini map and it was the best decision I made, the game, the sceneries just feel so much more gorgeous and alive. But it's really hard to navigate around after I took a few days off for real life obligations because I have no idea where and what I was doing."
witcher,3e0bu0,kapxis,3,Tue Jul 21 08:34:55 2015 UTC,"They should had a transparency option for the minimap so at 100% transparent it would just have the markers without any of the background color.  Also, add the option to change the size of the minimap.    They have a lot of HUD customization features in Battlefield 4 which are really nice.  You can basically alter every single marker/hud elements size, color, and transparency."
witcher,3e0bu0,Bmmaximus,4,Tue Jul 21 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"yeah we neeeed a freaking hud toggle.  I love having it off, but I can't stand pausing every 10 seconds to figure out where I'm going in cities and the like."

witcher,3e0bu0,greekgooner,2,Tue Jul 21 04:04:14 2015 UTC,"Hey there. On a phone so this won't be as exhaustive as I'd like but my setup is i7 + GTX780.  I have most options on high with certain elements ultra (terrain and texture detail for example).  Hairworks is always off for me and whilst I don't get anywhere near a constant 60fps, I get a 'smooth' experience. And on a game like this, that's more than enough for me.  All that aside, my secret is this SweetFX preset:  https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/3741/  Once I added this, I took one particular setting - sharpness or similar - down to zero because this not only bleaches out that over saturated look the default game has, but also ups the contrast in the process so added sharpness isn't needed.  Can't believe it's not more popular than it is because when I toggle between the vanilla and this, the default game looks like Disney's Tangled by comparison.  Hope this helps and write back if I missed anything.  TL:DR: INSTALL THIS SWEETFX PRESET FOR GREAT GFX  EDIT: i7-4930K"
witcher,3e0bu0,greekgooner,2,Tue Jul 21 07:39:23 2015 UTC,Are you sure your monitor is calibrated properly?   Try and do the windows calibration thing and see if that makes a difference.  I have the sharpness completely off in Witcher 3.
witcher,3e0bu0,c0smic_sans,3,Tue Jul 21 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"HUD - Off (completely) Music - Off Fast Travel - Minimal (or none)   I somehow feel this is the right way to play. You do have to manage a few more aspects of the game manually, but the trade off is immersion. You find ways to consult the map + look at your surroundings that get you to where you need to go...and combat becomes way more strategic as you don't know what lvl enemy you're fighting. Granted, it backfired a few times (What?! that thing was lvl 17...ooops, gotta wait about 10 lvls before I come back) but I'm loving every second of it."

In these counties the sun rises between 4-5AM and sets 8-9PM in general at summer. In W3 the sun is already up and shining at 3AM and winter is approaching so the time is set round fall, also the day/night shifting is in no harmony with the previous 2 games, it makes no sense, what the heck??? It bugs the hell out of me too."
witcher,3e0tit,Tomix1990,3,Tue Jul 21 08:51:05 2015 UTC,"Budapest is at a latitude of 47 degrees. Northern Poland is at 55 degrees. The climate and vegetation of the Northern Kingdoms looks like it's somewhere in that region on Earth, but this setting is explicitly not Earth.  The axial tilt could be sligthly different, and climate is affected even more by ocean currents than just latitude. If the Continent is on a planet exactly the size of Earth, and the tilt is the same, then Velen/Novigrad are somewhere around the 63rd parallel, which in Europe corresponds to the middle of Finland.   and winter is approaching so the time is set round fall,   No, actually the game starts in May and I'm pretty sure Forefather's Eve takes place on the summer solstice.  In one of the endings, the epilogue takes place 6 months after the events of the game, and it's the middle of winter."

witcher,3dzsgj,OriginalTodd,7,Mon Jul 20 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"Grats friend! I'm very intrigued by those who managed to fall on the Destiny treadmill for more than a few days. Did you play World of Warcraft or other MMOs during their golden era?  Maybe because as I got older, grinding has held less and less appeal as real life eats up more time. I played Everquest back in the day, then WoW and a bunch of other MMOs.  When I got around to Destiny, the grind was so visible it hit me in the head with a hammer so hard I exclaimed to my friend playing with me ""IS THIS ALL THERE IS?!"".  The bounties were just re-skinned Baal runs, aka rep grinds, aka  honor farming aka daily quests without a flying mount. Bungie made no attempts to hide the grind behind a nice story or refine the loop that I threw my NOPE stick at that shit so hard and uninstalled. The game in September felt like a throwback to the medieval MMO shit that even WoW had abandoned. Run these dungeons for tokens and maybe a chance at a usable piece of gear? But you'd usually get shit you didn't want or your friend needed but couldn't trade. Yeah, fuck no. What kept ya going?  Even when I had a few buddies playing I still had zero interest. And yet there are still those of our brothers and sisters still on that treadmill. I can't parse it."
witcher,3dzsgj,whiteravenxi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:59 2015 UTC,"I still play Destiny from time-to-time. For me, it's the JRPG-like grind. Trying to level or find a specific type of gear in Destiny is like grinding to draw rare magics in Final Fantasy VIII or trying to level your characters in Xenoblade Chronicles. To me, the game is basically a digital mandala...a point of focus that lets you tune out and focus on a rote activity. Not for everyone!"
witcher,3dzsgj,tonberryjr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:43:17 2015 UTC,"Former treadmiller here, figured i'd drop my two cents in on your question.  I picked up Destiny at Christmas time when I got an Xbone, a friend of mine had the game since September but had put it down after a month, he picked it back up to play with me and the social aspect of the game definitely helped soften the grinding. Also the game helped both of us reconnect with a friend we had lost touch with (which we know got to play and chat with every time we played Destiny). I was just running out of content as the second expansion was being released so the bridge into the new content wasn't as long a wait as some other folk so I wasn't growing as tired of it because I was still finding things to do (leveling a character of each class, running the raids on all of them, etc).  Now that we're knee deep into expansion two and I've pretty much done everything in the game I just don't find the grind appealing anymore. PVP was my only solace really but the whole meta is tits-up until September when they release the patch (which might I add is fucking ridiculous we have to wait months for a patch like that when the community has been chomping at the bit for it).  I have never played MMOs like WOW or Everquest so perhaps not seeing the grind so blatantly at the start heped ween me into the game. I can deifnitly see how people from MMO backgrounds won't touch the game."
witcher,3dzsgj,mimicus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:50 2015 UTC,"Never played WoW; I always liked my games to have more ""control"" over my character, as opposed to clicking a spot to move to and abilities mapped to a button like it, ya know?

Then when all the fiasco with TTK pricing kicked in and they expect me to pay £40 for something that is propbably a small fraction more than a DLC thn I sobered up quickly, i took the destiny disk out the tray and loaded up TW3 which i'd bought a few weeks before at a great price of £40.50.

The two DLC's killed the game for me. Crota was a poor raid and frustrating as hell, then PoE which you can't even play as a six.   PoE/ToO also demanded skilful players which would inevitably cause problem in mixed-skill fireteams.  There is a lot of content in Destiny to enjoy but the biggest problem with the game is there is no ending - so you just end up going around and around the grind-a-thon hoping for the next digital item to drop. When you start to feel that way it's time to put it down and play something else.

witcher,3dzsgj,Paul_cz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:24:40 2015 UTC,I stopped playing Destiny after getting the gjallahorn. Made the game a bit too easy.
witcher,3dzsgj,Paul_cz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:54:14 2015 UTC,"Every time me and my mates pondered why we still play destiny (as we're playing it), I would say ""for lack of a better game."" Destiny fills the void that has existed lately with not so many thrilling games. The only reason why it fills that void is because its easy to just jump in and play with friends. But gaming in general felt meh during this void period... until the Witcher 3 came out. However 200 hours later, finishing the game, im left to play destiny some more.... for lack of a better and unconquered game. At least until the Witcher 3 expansion and the many awesome games coming out in the holiday season."
witcher,3e3c56,DannyFilming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:16 2015 UTC,From the Oxenfurt jailbreak. I was happy I could release the prisoners in the prison in this game since I was unable to in the second one. But there's no way out through the sewers. I tried to tell them but they refuse to follow me!

witcher,3e3af1,cruelkillzone,2,Tue Jul 21 17:02:40 2015 UTC,"There are, although I can't tell how many. The one I remember is Leshen. The difference is the contracts ones may look different."

I got that same ending to that story as you did, but there are many points where you can decide a different outcome for a particular story and sometimes the consequences of your actions don't reveal themselves until much later.  That's what I like about this game.  It forces me to think about the choices I make and whether I would be OK if things went to shit because of it.  That's the way I play at least.

witcher,3e38k5,BearDidIt,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:19 2015 UTC,It's from all the crap she went through during the books. It's started to go white by the end of the last book....she had a really hard life.

witcher,3e38k5,Sathel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:50 2015 UTC,"Geralt took well to standard mutations that witchers go through, so he was selected for additional experimental mutations and they removed pigmentation from him. Thats why is near albino and has white hair."
witcher,3e38k5,zeypherIN,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:53 2015 UTC,One of my (minor) frustrations with W3 is that he's not pale enough any more. He rides past people who call him a mutant and a freak but the only thing that really marks him out physically is his eyes - most of the people slinging abuse aren't close enough to pick that out.

witcher,3e38k5,SenatorIncitatus,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:08 2015 UTC,"It basically further enhanced the things witchers normally gain from the mutations. E.g speed, strength, enhanced senses."
witcher,3e38k5,KA1N3R,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:58 2015 UTC,Geralt only has white hair because he underwent some special mutations. Vesemir is simply old as hell. Lambert and Eskel have normal hair because they only received the normal witcher mutations.

witcher,3dy4ti,AstroDude84,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:11 2015 UTC,"It is kinda stupid, but you can treat it as a challenge. I would not mind it to be honest.  Sometimes unexpected difficulties can be refreshing and forces you to adjust and use stuff you would otherwise treat as inferior.  Personally I think that in Witcher 3, you get good equipment very fast....too fast. I would not mind using weaker equipment for a longer time and maybe get witcher armor schematics only after hard quest or something."

Even before, the mastercrafted Witcher gear's level requirements were the same level requirements as the final stages of the story.  I'm keeping optimistic on this one. It's easier to say when you've just restarted a new game and aren't stripped of your current armor, though."
witcher,3dy4ti,DiluvialAscension,2,Mon Jul 20 19:30:11 2015 UTC,if your adding additional DLC (or expansions as I suspect it will be) wouldnt you have new tiers of witcher gear in them for 10 or 20 hours of content?
witcher,3dy4ti,HarleyQuinn_RS,0,Mon Jul 20 20:15:45 2015 UTC,"In a dream world, absolutely, add even more content. Or perhaps add missions/story and shift up armor for a middle-of-the-road approach. Again, it's just an optimistic outlook. Crossing my fingers.  I just don't think CDPR would increase level requirements thinking they were already too low, but who knows."
witcher,3dy4ti,Analtoast,3,Mon Jul 20 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"I personally think it was a mistake, or else I would expect it to be in the patch notes... but it hasnt been corrected, so it doesnt matter."
witcher,3dy4ti,A_CHEERFUL_GUY,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:19 2015 UTC,the other difficulty here is that the levels have been published in a lot of online sources and now those are all going to be wrong.  Have a pay close attention in the future at the armorer's so that you don't upgrade anything before it's usable.
witcher,3dy4ti,gumbo_chops,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't even understand why they did it.   I do. Witcher gear is a very large reason as to why the game is as easy as it is. Increasing the requirements makes sense. They still have a ways to go though in balancing properly.

witcher,3dy4ti,Platanium,2,Mon Jul 20 21:19:41 2015 UTC,I was upset for a moment.  I downloaded the patch and had a cutscene where I had to take off my swords and after that I realized what had happened. It was unfortunate as I had enhanced griffen swords. I had to recraft the basic griffen swords obly4 to level up one time to equipped the enhanced versions. A little tedious in my opinion.
witcher,3dy4ti,kenken2k2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:12 2015 UTC,"Yup, the exact same thing happened to me but with feline swords. It was a really poor way of trying to re-balance the gear for anyone caught mid-game imo. They should have lowered stats if that was their goal."

In TW2 he gets dragged into a political conspiracy and needs to go on this huge quest to clear his name and regain his memory. So things are more urgent."

That said, surely I can't be the only one who didn't find TW1 all that great? And not just the combat and dated gameplay.

witcher,3dwnds,haste75,3,Mon Jul 20 17:13:38 2015 UTC,"This just reminds me of a constant thought I've had while playing Witcher.  To me it looks like Ciris sword is too long compared to her arm for her to pull it out of the scabbard. If you think about it, wouldnt she only get it two thirds of the way of the scabbard before she couldnt raise her arm any higher?"
witcher,3dwnds,turroflux,2,Mon Jul 20 07:46:48 2015 UTC,"Aren't all the back scabbards only loosely tied to the straps, so they can move up or sideways to allow the blade to slide out?  So the scabbard would be pulled more horizontal as the blade was drawn, and sideways."
witcher,3dwnds,Thundersnowflake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:47:51 2015 UTC,Then why doesn't it hang horizontally when the sword is in it?
witcher,3dwnds,turroflux,2,Mon Jul 20 09:58:25 2015 UTC,"I mean horizontal and parallel with the ground, so the sword is drawn from over the shoulder at an diagonal angle, with the scabbard almost at a 90 degree angle to the back at the end of the draw."
witcher,3dwnds,haste75,3,Mon Jul 20 10:09:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Still though, if the sword was longer than her arm, would it not have the same issues regardless of how the scabbard moves?"
witcher,3dwnds,turroflux,0,Mon Jul 20 11:18:07 2015 UTC,"The only way that would be a problem is if the blade was so long that it needed to be pulled at an angle that exceeds 90 degrees from the shoulder.   If it makes more sense, get a long stick like a broom, put it against your back, then without breaking contact with your back, pull it up and over your shoulder, you should be able to manage it, and it'll be way longer than ciri's sword."
witcher,3dwnds,BlackViperMWG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:21 2015 UTC,"You possibly can't, if the sword is longer than your arm. Only way is to pull up the sheath down with your other hand, so you don't need to pull the sword from whole length of the sheath over your shoulder."
witcher,3dwnds,Thundersnowflake,4,Mon Jul 20 15:20:05 2015 UTC,"Yes I know what you mean, but if a back scabbard is loose enough to allow that, the scabbard wouldn't it be horizontal all the time from the sword pushing it down?"
witcher,3dwnds,billlybob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:22:48 2015 UTC,"If you look at some of the animations in the game, you can tell the scabbards they use are made from leather and another garment I'm unsure of.   The ""hilt"" and tip of the scabbard are usually made of steel/bronze, and there's light steel/bronze on the back of the scabbard, for attaching to your clothing, usually at the hip.  This keeps the scabbard rigid, but also malleable enough for you to bend it when you're unsheathing a sword, as long as the ""hilt"" opening is wide enough to allow it. The scabbard is also usually attached to your clothing or armor close to the ""hilt"", so it can bend along with your motion, like a hinge.  Katana and ceremonial blades often have a completely rigid scabbard made of wood or steel/bronze, and unsheathing the sword is a very delicate process, and cannot realistically be done from the back, over the shoulder."

When running the update in this manner, the installer will become non-responsive at around 95% and if you terminate the process, the game will run but you won't be able to install DLCs because somewhere in the system is hasn't updated the version properly.  So, you have 2 options.   Run GOG Galaxy and let it download and install the update AGAIN Re-install your game and run the 1.07 update again from the EXE you downloaded, but DO NOT terminate the process. Just wait for it and it will eventually complete.   Hope that helps."

It just won't be out for several years as they are still working on content for this game and CyberPunk 2077.

For some reason the option was grayed out ingame so i thought that was the normal ""Loosely Gathered, Tied Behind the Head"" option. Just saw a vid of a person clicking the option with the DLC though so i went and looked a bit further.  Also quick question, read that the hair stops growing with the DLC, is that true?"
witcher,3e28d0,Dubya75,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:41 2015 UTC,"I am not aware of any hair growth, only beard growth. This still happens depending on the beard style you choose. If you go with clean shave or the full trimmed, then it will grow. If you choose one of the other beard styles, then it will not grow. The logic behind that is that CDPR assumes that if you choose an alternative style of facial hair, you'd want to keep it like that."

witcher,3e26qf,gatsuB,3,Tue Jul 21 11:32:17 2015 UTC,"Crafting is definitely better. The crafted armor sets and swords are miles better than stuff you find. Loot tends to be slightly lower level that the quest/monster, which means you rarely find loot worth equipping, the best items are crafted.  Crafting, however, feels really satisfying. Getting a top level armor set feels amazing and requires many hours of searching for recipes and ingredients.  Getting the top level alchemy stuff is also quite rewarding, however quite overpowered, especially if your focus is on alchemy skills"
witcher,3e26qf,slavabez,2,Tue Jul 21 11:47:53 2015 UTC,and takes even more time than crafting arms and armor.
witcher,3e26qf,ozman51,2,Tue Jul 21 12:37:03 2015 UTC,The loot is actually pretty disappointing once you reach mid-game as crafted gear is superior in almost every way. Crafting is fairly straight-forward too and doesn't require a huge amount of rare ingredients except for the previous tier.  Overall I feel the overpowered nature of the Witcher sets really diminishes the satisfaction you get from looting and quest rewards.  I wish they hadn't added them or at least made them no more powerful than standard relics.
witcher,3e26qf,DeeJayDelicious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:02 2015 UTC,"Loot/Gear is a little different than the traditional RPG mechanics and even a little more deep than Skyrim.  You are Geralt, and Geralt is not an artisan, he is a professional monster hunter.  There is looted gear and some of it is decent but depending on how you manage you level with respect to the quests you undertake you will likely find the loot on enemies to be below what is craft-able.    Enter schematic and crafting of Witcher gear.  Normal -> Enhanced -> Superior - > Master which all have level dependencies.    I found crafting my existing gear into even better gear to be more rewarding than RNG drops.  You do need to enlist the aid of the actual master craftsmen to build the best gear in the game."

witcher,3e1j6a,ian356094,17,Tue Jul 21 06:18:07 2015 UTC,"Coping what I have once written in another forum:  Anyway, one of the flaws in Sapkowski's writing is the fact that his books (novels to be precise) don't feel like they have a beginning, a middle and the end. There's really no better way to read them than to view them as one whole. I'd say only The Swallow's Tower has a clear, distinctive structure, but even then it wouldn't fit nicely into a season of a TV show. There would have to be changes.  The best way to approach this is divide the plot into 5 seasons, 13-16 episodes each. This would be enough, as the books aren't that long.  Season 1: all the short stories. It would have a kinda-sorta procedural feel to it, as each episode would deal with one monster of the week. They should go with the chronological order, even squeezing Season of Storms in there somewhere. It would end with dramatic Nilfgaard invasion, Slaughter of Cintra, Battle of Sodden Hill and Geralt finding Ciri in the end. Plenty of drama just in time for season finale.  Season 2: Blood of Elves and half of Time of Contempt. Start pretty much like the first novel, season finale would be The Thanedd Coup, with fate of all main characters hanging in the balance. Geralt almost killed, Yennefer missing and Ciri stuck in the middle of the desert. CLIFFHANGER.  Season 3: Finishing Time of Contempt, all of Baptism of Fire and ending with “Sir Geralt of Rivia”, Yennefer escaping the Lodge and Leo Bonhart capturing Ciri. I am of the opinion that all the Rats stuff would fit better into one season, as Ciri doesn't have much to do in Baptism of Fire and telling this tale for one season would be much more effective.  Season 4: Tower of Swallow. I'm not sure if telling it all in flashbacks would be a good idea, maybe the chronological order would work better. But it definitely ends how the book ended.  Season 5: Lady of the Lake, pretty much as is. Emperor's reveal should be in the penultimate episode and the finale wrapping it all up."

witcher,3e1j6a,EirikBjorn,5,Tue Jul 21 09:02:11 2015 UTC,"I also have a few casting ideas! Not too many, but I would trust casting directors to pick some lesser known actors to fill other parts. And it would be a TV show, so TV actors are definitely sufficient for it. There are some popular choices there and some of my own.  Geralt of Rivia - Mads Mikkelsen. He has perfect age, looks, phisique and presence for it. Not to mention acting ability. His stoicism would be great for Geralt and a rare showcase of emotion could land a desired punch when needed. And he used to be a dancer, too! I can not imagine anyone better for the role.  Yennefer - I'm torn between Eva Green and Lara Pulver (Irene Adler from Sherlock).   Dandelion - Jamie Camil. He's hilarious and whoever saw him on Jane the Virgin will probably agree. If you didn't there's a small sample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZKID-qLrPo or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjSegUV-81A Basically: Dandelion.

witcher,3e1j6a,mason2401,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:19:45 2015 UTC,"For all its warts, I think the original TV series/movie had the right idea with compiling the script by picking bits and pieces from all the books. The execution killed it, but the concept was sound.  I'd also make it an international co-production to fish for acting talent (not sure if Poland has enough of it to cast all the roles adequately). Plus I'm a fan of old European swashbuckling flicks usually shot in wide co-operation between various countries. I think that approach could really work wonders with a cinematic adaptation of The Witcher.  When it comes to the role of a director, I think Bagiński, having quite an experience with the franchise, is a good bet. He mostly dabbles in CGI, though, and I can't say I was smitten by his only (?) live action short for European Space Agency he did last year. But I think film's main problem was the script, not the direction."
witcher,3e1j6a,gbursztynek,0,Tue Jul 21 06:41:48 2015 UTC,"Center it around Geralt & Yen, with Vilgefortz as the main Villain.  Cast Kate Beckinsley as Yen maybe?  As for Geralt, some polish lesser-known actor with a lot of charisma and inexpressive faces xD  Also Milva and Regis NEED to be in it ! Regis is the most interesting character for me after Yen & Ciri.  Have Geralt renounce being a Witcher at the end of the movie, like in the books   omg I just thought about Michael Fassbender as Vilgefortz , wouldn't he be great ?   +Gory battle of Brenna tidbits :D"

And anyways, there's no particular reason to believe the talisman would have protected her from the Crones. The Pellar has some magical ability but what he does is a cheap parlor trick compared to them."
witcher,3e2jpd,BorisJonson1593,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the journal says that the talisman slowed the curse the crones put on her when she asked to not bear the baron's child but I seriously doubt it would've stopped the fiend that abducted her or if the crones intervened directly. and AFAIK there is no way to interact with Tamara after the quest is finished anyways"
witcher,3e2jpd,faseras,0,Tue Jul 21 14:27:34 2015 UTC,"Really... it seems like that peller could have somehting that protects her... he seems fairly capable... and the crones do just suddenly get Anna when she runs off with her daughter. It seems like the talisman works till she loses it. And who says it was actually lost. Baron implies that it could have. And Tamara goes all eternal fire, who would be pretty against wacky magic. Maybe I just didn't catch the part where some says it was dropped..."

The NPCs would go the players max speed and wait for him if he didn't follow quick enough. Very simple. Witcher 3 does it even better because if the player walks, they also walk. But other games choose to have NPCs walk in a speed between running and walking, infuriating."

witcher,3dymid,BorisJonson1593,7,Mon Jul 20 22:06:58 2015 UTC,Jenny o the woods sucked so hard.  I'd be flawless all fight then screw up once and get two shot in half a second.
witcher,3dymid,sagpony,9,Mon Jul 20 20:09:48 2015 UTC,Imlerith on death march is the only fight that felt like something out of Dark Souls because I actually had to learn his attack patterns and dodge around a lot. I still have to fight Caranthir and Eredin though and I remember Caranthir being pretty tough even on blood and broken bones. I just hate how the game takes away control right before you beat a boss. It really takes away from the sense of accomplishment for me.
witcher,3dymid,BorisJonson1593,10,Mon Jul 20 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"I always thought Caranthir was a cake walk, when he summons the ice giant you can make him kill it for you by aligning his move (with the several dots) so that they hit the giant in the back, killing it instantly."
witcher,3dymid,hunteram,3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"I've heard he's harder for pure melee builds and that's what my blood and broken bones play through was so maybe that was it. This time I'm doing mostly signs with a bit of alchemy so we'll see how that goes. Using that homing spell attack to kill the adds is a good idea, though. I'll keep that in mind."
witcher,3dymid,Jared28469,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:36 2015 UTC,"Nah my playthrough with pure sign build was a pain in the ass, too. At least you can heal a lot with sustained Quen and the skill that converts damage into health."

witcher,3dymid,BodzioBlue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:10 2015 UTC,The Eredin fight takes forever. I had to quit after I died vs him the second time from exhaustion and frustration. I must have been fighting for 20 minutes straight at that point.
witcher,3dymid,Lineste,6,Mon Jul 20 22:43:43 2015 UTC,"To be honest, that fight is badly designed. The camera moves too slowly which makes his second form artificially difficult.

Repeated this 4-5 times, every time I couldn't dodge and never hit him and kept dying so freaking quickly T.T (also, I don't know if that was the case for you, but every time I fought Imlerith, it took me 7-8 min to get him to drop his shield, I don't know if I hit like crpa at that level or if he just had a ton of life, lol)."

You can build a decently more powerful computer for like... $800 though.  And the system your friends use generally heavily influences your platform decision. As someone who only owns a PC (and a Wii & 3DS), I see the merit of consoles even if they're not for me. Some people just don't mind low framerate."

I'm at 101hours, lvl 14, but im pretty slow and like to take my time, so i would say it has about 60 hours of actual content up to that point, and zero time fillers, every quest i did feels like its part of the story and world. immersive as fuck."

witcher,3dwxls,MyDearMrsTumnus,4,Mon Jul 20 15:04:00 2015 UTC,TW3 is indeed a fantastic game but keep in mind that CDPR ran out of budget for TW2 and had to cut their planned content. It was still an enjoyable game and sometimes I think about what could have been. It was also never meant to be an open world game though at times I think I like the approach better. The distinct areas seem much more polished since they didn't have to worry about an open world.

witcher,3dwxls,MyDearMrsTumnus,3,Mon Jul 20 21:04:32 2015 UTC,"The reason TW1 was so long is due to CDPR being an inexperienced game developer at the time.

witcher,3dwxls,Alelnh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:19:34 2015 UTC,I started in Blood and Broken Bones and roughly at the end of Novigrad I decided to crank the difficult up to Death March because Blood and Broken Bones had become too trivial at one point. But then I did catch up eventually to the dificulty.

So far, I've only put points into the first two fast attack skills, arrow block, quen shield, igni 1 and 2, axii, and the medium armor perk. That leaves me with 8 points currently unassigned at lvl 18.  I feel like a heavy sign build would keep me from getting OP and would just require me to be really active in combat.  (avoiding percentage damage increases, damage reduction, etc.)"

From the graphics, to all the dialogue, to the incredibly fun non-turn-based combat I loved it all. Even things like enemy's crawling down trees to try to engage you, and you having the ability to either fight them, prepare done potions/oils, or just run away was cool.

I thought the Witcher series was quite different in the way of how it went about getting the players into fights and how the fights played out.   I was playing the King's Bounty reboot series, for a while. Fun turn based combat, with modern(ish) graphics. Shit story telling compared to anything CDPR has done, but as a relaxing slow paced RPG they're great."

witcher,3dwxls,Droslen,5,Mon Jul 20 07:00:50 2015 UTC,How do you do 330 hours and only get to level 18? Do you just not do quests or kill anything?

witcher,3dwxls,Droslen,3,Mon Jul 20 08:25:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I mean... it feels like you'd have to actively ignore picking up quests or killing monsters. Sometimes I pick up a quest but then park it if it takes me out of my way, but a lot of the time quests are one step jobs... which give experience.  I get that the game is pretty and it's actually a lot of fun to literally spend time exploring, but it feels like that must be far and away how you spend the majority of your time."
witcher,3dwxls,shivering,-5,Mon Jul 20 08:33:05 2015 UTC,I don't have to explain or defend how I play a game to you or anyone else.  You play your way and I will play mine.
witcher,3dwxls,saltlets,6,Mon Jul 20 08:36:28 2015 UTC,''defend'' implies that anyone attacked you. I too am struggling to see how you put that much time into Velen.
witcher,3dwxls,Otadiz,-4,Mon Jul 20 09:03:45 2015 UTC,"I am being questioned or interrogated about how I play.  I already said how I play.  I love to explore the living hell out of shit, that's what takes so long and doing it on foot takes longer.  I'm sorry I don't play as fast as you people, doesn't give you the right to question my play style or downvote me.  Sorry I don't blow my load all over the game and blow through it within a month or two weeks.  I take my time.  Also, some of us have actual lives and can't devote every minute to gaming.  I may get in 3-4 hours tops a day, sometimes not at all but the game is just running minimized in the background."
witcher,3dwxls,saltlets,5,Mon Jul 20 09:12:32 2015 UTC,"Whatever, if that's how you feel every time someone asks you something out of curiosity, then it must be really hard interacting with other people. It seems to me you just realised you played way less than even a 100 hours, so maybe you've now realized how  extreme 300+ hours seems for Velen alone, and how someone might feel like asking for an explanation without actually ""accusing you of a crime""."
witcher,3dwxls,BiggDope,-6,Mon Jul 20 09:25:59 2015 UTC,"That's the problem though.  You aren't asking me something out of curiosity.  You're asking me in order to judge me.  I won't be judged for my playstyle or how long I take to play a game, etc.  I can not stand backseat gaming.  All that matters is that I enjoy my time, which I am.  I don't need your judgement or anyone else's.  Yah, I get it, I'm SLOW, but I don't care.  I'm having fun exploring the world and breathing it all in.  Plus, I play A LOT of Gwent...(don't judge)"
witcher,3dwxls,Moominpappa,5,Mon Jul 20 09:33:41 2015 UTC,"Haha, dude you just judged me. Please don't pretend to know why I do whatever I do, because you clearly don't. And by the way; I didn't ask you anything."
witcher,3dwxls,Otadiz,2,Mon Jul 20 09:37:43 2015 UTC,"Man it's gaming, don't be so sensitive."
witcher,3dwxls,Otadiz,4,Mon Jul 20 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"I may get in 3-4 hours tops a day   It's been 61 days since W3 launched, at ""4 hours a day tops"" it's not possible to get to 330 hours.   the game is just running minimized in the background.   So your rather precise number is actually meaningless, and now you know why people are downvoting you. It's not because us poopsocking nolifers don't approve of how fast you play, it's because you're exaggerating.  A hundred hours to get to level 18? Totally believable. Maybe even 200 if you're picking every herb and making a hand-drawn topographical map of Novigrad by RP walking through it. 330 is just absurd."
witcher,3dwxls,DerFelix,0,Mon Jul 20 11:29:31 2015 UTC,"I am not exaggerating.  LOOK: http://i.imgur.com/erwWPjp.jpg  GoG Galaxy says 341 hours.  Edit: So I might not be getting 4 hours EVERY day, sue me.  I'm not keeping track of the shit, that's what the counters are for.  I just live my life and play my game."
witcher,3dwxls,Otadiz,2,Mon Jul 20 11:58:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you yourself admitted that you leave the game running in the background. So you know it's not 330 hours played, just 330 hours of witcher3.exe running.   Edit: So I might not be getting 4 hours EVERY day, sue me. I'm not keeping track of the shit, that's what the counters are for. I just live my life and play my game.   I know you're not. I said that even if you were playing 4 hours every day, 61 days equal 244 hours, so 330 is patently impossible by the schedule you yourself described.  Look, most of the downvotes at this point are because you're being overly defensive and whining about downvotes. Here's what happened:   You looked at GoG Galaxy and gave that number, even though you know you often let the game idle. People saw the number you claimed as played time, which was completely out of the realm of the possible, and raised questions/downvoted. Instead of saying ""well, it's probably about half that, since I often leave the game on"", you started whining about downvotes and explaining that you like to take your time.   You started defending a lie you never intended to tell. It's much easier to just correct your initial statement with a small postcript saying ""I sometimes let the game idle"", and no one would be arguing with you."

There was A few nights I forgot to close the game and it idled in the background.  According to GoG right now it's 341h 34m and 31% done.  Lmao, at this rate, I'll be done when Arkham Knight re-releases."
witcher,3dwxls,Otadiz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:15:42 2015 UTC,Can you check for the counter ingame (press I then C) just to compare?
witcher,3dwxls,ZombieGoombaZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:08:35 2015 UTC,There's an in-game counter?
witcher,3dwxls,Otadiz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:10:18 2015 UTC,"Yup, if you go e.g. in the inventory it says in the bottom of the screen to press C to get to player stats or something like that. In there it will tell you the play time. I am just interested in what it tells you there, because I think the ingame counter is broken, but I want to see HOW broken :D It will probably show too much."
witcher,3dwxls,ZombieGoombaZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:15:03 2015 UTC,"Yah, I can certainly do that for you.  One, second please and thank you for not harassing me because ""Oh no I've been playing 330 hours on GoG Galaxy and I'm only level 18.""  Man, fuck that.  I will take 100 years if I so please.  Anyways, I'll get this counter.  OK so it says..wow this IS broken..  Total Play Time: 2 Days, 5 Hours, 52 Minutes, and 48 Seconds.  That is CERTAINLY NOT 330 hours or as my GoG client now says 341 hours.  But then again I'm guessing GoG is only keeping track of the game running, not actually being played, whereas the timer on the game only keeps track of it when it's actively running.  If it's sitting in the pause menu, which is where I place it predominantly most of the time, rather than the Inventory screen, perhaps it doesn't record as playtime."
witcher,3dwxls,Otadiz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:20:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting. For me it's bugged the other way around. 70 hours in Steam, 13 days(!) ingame."
witcher,3dwxls,TatManTat,2,Mon Jul 20 09:27:15 2015 UTC,"You are right about the in-game counter being bugged.  Earlier when I gave it to you, it said 2 days.  Now it says 1 day.  Now, that's not right unless I've gone back in time, which I did not."

Kaer Morhen, witchers' last bastion and Geralt's home, is attacked by people who want to steal the secret to produce more witchers. Tons of weird and epic shit happen. Geralt finds out and kills everyone responsible. He also bangs Triss Merigold and a dozen other hot females in the process. - Witcher 2: Geralt still has amnesia but regains his memories gradually during the game. King Foltest of Temeria is assassinated by a witcher named Letho and Geralt is framed for it. Roche, Foltest's trusted commander, releases Geralt and works with him to catch Letho. In this game, Geralt also develops feelings for Triss. Tons of weird and epic shit happen, but in the end, they find out that Letho was hired by the emperor of Nilfgaard, the powerful, expansionist kingdom in the south to murder all the kings in the north so that he can easily invade them. The plan succeeded, and the huge army of Nilfgaard march on to invade the north. Game ends here. - Witcher 3: (no spoilers) All northern kings are dead except for the young and genius Radovid, king of Redania, who now stands in Emyr's way (Nilfgaard's emperor). Geralt also has completely recovered his memories  and is now looking for Yennefer and Ciri, his daughter (not biologically). Edit: fixed a typo"

witcher,3dwho8,wolfenburg,31,Mon Jul 20 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"I loved pretty much everything about the Battle of Kaer Morhen.  The Witchers all got to be supper badass. Yen and Triss were also badass, even saved the Witchers at one point. Ciri got her moment to shine. Most importantly, though, the Wild Hunt felt like a real threat. Despite all the awesomeness, the heroes were almost always one the retreat, so it really felt like a losing battle. Even at the end with Ciri's scream, just seeing Eredin trying to grab her despite the terrible pain he was feeling was awesome. It really is too bad they didn't fulfill the initial promise of the Wild Hunt because during this battle they were great."
witcher,3dwho8,AManWithAKilt,6,Mon Jul 20 05:55:42 2015 UTC,"Ciri's scream at the end of the battle made me excited to have her on my side, yet terrified of what she could accidentally do. Great way to end that overwhelming battle.   It really is too bad they didn't fulfill the initial promise of the Wild Hunt because during this battle they were great   Not sure what the promise was- care to elaborate?"
witcher,3dwho8,sevendots,12,Mon Jul 20 13:12:58 2015 UTC,"They didn't really expand on Eredin or Caranthir as characters. We find out that Eredin's world is dying and Caranthir was a protege of Avallac'h but that's about it. In the end Eredin only has about ten lines in the game, Caranthir has even less. It just felt to me like we would get more about the Wild Hunt after Kaer Morhen ended and the game continued."
witcher,3dwho8,AManWithAKilt,7,Mon Jul 20 15:18:37 2015 UTC,"cdpr was probably afraid of showing the wild hunt too much and spoiling them. you show them too often with random appearances and invasions and suddenly they're about as terrifying as the dragons from skyrim or the oblivion gates. unfortunately, cdpr went a little bit too much in the opposite direction.  i liked the way bioshock infinite had comstock and the songbird appear throughout the game."

witcher,3dwho8,AManWithAKilt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:18 2015 UTC,I think this is like the horror movie thing where people say if you show the monsters the movie gets lot less scary.

witcher,3dwho8,badgarok725,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:21:51 2015 UTC,Even with his two lines Caranthir struck me as the most badass of the group. Probably because we actually see him fight and how he goes out like a hardo.

Other characters, aside from Ves and Roche, really don't acknowledge him and the cutscene with Geralt and Lambert is literally exactly the same except with Letho in the background. I found that cutscene to be really weird with him in it."
witcher,3dwho8,mypenisthepipe,10,Mon Jul 20 03:39:23 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the fact that he looks so weird. Like they took his body and downscaled it. He's supposed to be a mountain of meat, but he has basically the same proportions as everyone else in the game. It's a massive downgrade from Witcher 2.   Similarly, I think Triss looks better in the Witcher 2 as well. I think it's the hair, it looked more realistic in the previous game (color is obviously not natural but still)."
witcher,3dwho8,FruitlessVenture,4,Mon Jul 20 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"The award for the best NPC model still goes to King Foltest in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, Witcher 3 had absolutely amazingly detailed models, but King Foltest just was the best CDPR has ever done."
witcher,3dwho8,Mandarion,5,Mon Jul 20 05:51:57 2015 UTC,Need to point out that Foltest's model had a big jump in quality between the original Witcher 2 and the Enhanced Edition. The latter making him on par with the best character models in W3. I loved his costume too.
witcher,3dwho8,Play_by_Play,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:33 2015 UTC,his costume design really is top-notch. was happy to see him on the gwent cards.
witcher,3dwho8,onceyougoblak,2,Mon Jul 20 15:30:29 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I pre-ordered Witcher 2, but couldn't play it when it came out. A year later or so I finally got a computer that could handle the game, and by then I enjoyed it in all its Enhanced glory..."
witcher,3dwho8,Mandarion,3,Mon Jul 20 15:32:22 2015 UTC,"First of all Geralt and Letho are the same height in W2. The ending scene shows a full body face to face shot of the two of them. Letho just has ridiculous hulk-like proportions that make him the bigger man. Second of all Letho's model on W3 is the exact same model from W2. It's a direct port. They didn't change a thing. He's the only character from the W2 reappearing in W3 where they did that, making your ""downgrade"" comment all the more silly."
witcher,3dwho8,Play_by_Play,0,Mon Jul 20 16:42:39 2015 UTC,"My god, people get so agitated whenever the word ""downgrade"" is used. PTSD? Anyway.  I think he looks worse in W3 compared to W2. Maybe it isn't the height then, but he doesn't look as big as he used to, and maybe the lighting in W3 makes his texturing look weird or something, I don't know. All I know is that I think he looks better in W2 to me."
witcher,3dwho8,FruitlessVenture,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"It's the same exact model. They literally took the model they built for Witcher 2 and just plugged it into Witcher 3 without changing a single thing. Which is probably part of the problem. His ambient occlusion seems to be be turned off or set too low.   The lighting in W2 is completely different. It had a high contrast and color saturation look to it, so it always looked dark no matter what time of the day it was. Letho has lots of big muscles and bumps and would cast a lot of shadows on himself. W3 has a more muted look where daytime seems more realistic but night and dark scenes aren't as dark. That's what you're seeing. I agree they could have done a better job on Letho's lighting, or maybe just built a new model for the game, but using terms like ""massive downgrade"" is a bit over the top, since (1) His size didn't change, and (2) It's the same exact model you saw it the previous game."
witcher,3dwho8,Play_by_Play,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"Didn't even come across Letho until last night, my second play through. I thought he looked familiar, then realized damn- he's in the trailer for the previous game! I wish I could have experienced his story instead of read about it, he seems to have a very interesting background."
witcher,3dwho8,sevendots,3,Mon Jul 20 19:16:54 2015 UTC,Letho's best scene in W2 is actually the intro movie to the enhanced edition of the game. You can do a search and watch it online. It's like a super cool short cgi action film.

witcher,3dwho8,Dattura,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:03 2015 UTC,have you seen the sword fights in game of thrones? They're serviceable but it's pretty impossible to get a spectacular fight like this when you gotta film the next episode in 2 weeks.

witcher,3e15t9,pinkprofit,21,Tue Jul 21 03:59:34 2015 UTC,"I don't understand oils.    Use oils on your swords to get a boost of damage against a specific enemy. Use the bestiary to look up the enemy type, match the enemy type to the oil type.    I don't understand alchemy or crafting.    Pick up recipes for potions/oils/bombs/decoctions. You now know this recipe. Pick up the various ingredients while playing. Personally I loot everything I see, and I buy whatever else I'm missing.   Open the alchemy tab, if any of the recipes are green then craft that potion. If anything is red, use the new pin feature, speak to a herbalist and buy what you're missing, or go kill a monster to get that missing monster ingredient.   For crafting, do the same thing except you need to have an armorer/blacksmith craft the weapons/armor. You can craft bombs yourself though.    I don't understand the health system or how I'm supposed to heal.    If you're on the 2 lowest difficulties you can meditate to heal fully, or eat food, or drink a swallow potion. If you're on the 2 hardest difficulties you'll have to eat or drink a potion, you can't meditate to heal.   Additionally there is a neutral skill point you can take that will give you regen during the day.    If I play on blood and bruises I get annihilated due to not understanding how to utilize the many many different ways to approach a fight.   Once again look up the bestiary for the monster you're fighting. It will tell you what the monster is weak again.  Use those weaknesses against the monster.   Until you start getting better at fighting Quen is your friend. Use it soak up some damage, retreat, reapply it, attack again.   Learn to parry/counterattack. Parry, just hold parry button, mouse right click on PC. While parrying you can counterattack when the enemy tries to hit you.   Learn the difference between dodging and rolling, many times a simple dodge is all that's needed to not get hit.   Finally, if you're not sure about anything use the in game tutorial to get a quick summary of a specific function.   Hopefully this helped you, good luck."
witcher,3e15t9,CiscoLearn,3,Tue Jul 21 04:19:22 2015 UTC,Yes it did thank you. This is exactly why I asked on here.   When collecting items. Is there a way to find out the location of ingredients without memorizing the map? Is it worthwhile to use the crafting system or should you purchase your weapons through the stores?  What's the best way to get vitalilty on the harder difficulties?
witcher,3e15t9,UK_Turp,3,Tue Jul 21 04:30:04 2015 UTC,"Best way to gain vitality - for me, I keep food stuff (water, bread, wolf liver, etc) in one slot, and the potion ""Swallow"" in the other (up and down on the D-pad). Each adds to vitality through regeneration for 5-10 seconds. I've found that this helps keep my health stable during combat if and when I take damage. Always make sure to keep alcohol in your inventory, that way, when you meditate, it will refill your used potions."
witcher,3e15t9,CiscoLearn,4,Tue Jul 21 04:37:57 2015 UTC,"Literally loot every enemy you kill and every chest/bag/whatever you come across. You will get to a point where you don't have to loot everything because you'll have so much already, and will have most of the potions etc created. Additionally you'll get enough money that it will become easy enough to buy the 1 or 2 ingredients you're missing from a herbalist.    What is harder to come across are some specific monster ingredients, though you should naturally find most everything you need just by playing through the story and side quests. If you need further help finding something I would suggest googling for that specific ingredient you're missing.    Use the crafting system. I personally only craft the various Witcher gear that you find through the treasure quests, but I'm sure others enjoy crafting the various equipment you'll come to learn about. There's 0 point to purchase any equipment through the shops. You'll be picking up loads of weapons from enemies and if you're looting everything you'll find good equipment as well.    Remember to keep your eyes peeled, you never know when you'll come across some chest in a dungeon/cave. Perhaps spend some time exploring the different points of interest around Velen/Novigrad/Oxenfurt, you'll come across guarded treasure and bandit camps and this will help get you some decent enough starting gear.    I'm not sure if you mean increasing your max vitality or just healing in general. I think for max vitality there is a skill or two that increases it, and some potions temporarily increase it as well.    If you mean by healing, I think the swallow potion is your best bet to start with, and it gets stronger as you increase it's level. There's another potion that does an instant health gain vs Swallows regen, but I can't remember the name. There's also 2 decoctions that will heal you. 1 heals you when you do damage, and I believe 1 heals you when you use stamina, so when using signs essentially, or certain sword attacks. I can't remember the names right now though, I'm sure someone else can chime in and fill in the blanks.   Edit: Those should be labelled 1/2/3 but I guess they can't be separated by other text."
witcher,3e15t9,imakeelyu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:51:27 2015 UTC,Thank You for the time you put into that response
witcher,3e15t9,Xacius,2,Tue Jul 21 12:33:33 2015 UTC,"not really, you could try googling it maybe someone has made a map or something.  Just take everything you can.  The latest patch changed it so that all crafting items are weightless. Crafting almost always gives you good gear, buying almost never does.  You can find some neat stuff too.  Honestly I just stuck to Witcher gear, it's definitely good enough and when you buy the maps you'll know exactly where to find them.  The Swallow potion gives you good health regen, White Raffard's decoction gives you instant health gain.  Food gives you health regen as well, but not as much and it gets interrupted by taking damage.  Don't forget to upgrade your potions.    If you want, you could go for an alchemy build.  This is the one I ended up using to beat the main story on Blood and Broken Bones: http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/skill-calculator/?combat=115_125_225&alchemy=115_125_143_215_255_323_335_345_425&general=251  This build focuses on being tanky and dealing damage with heavy strikes while chugging potions for extra buffs.  Bear School techniques + full Ursine set gives you a decent chunk of extra health and damage.  With all the alchemy skills, you can slot three Greater Green Mutagens for even more health.  On top of that, Refreshment heals you 25% of your health just for drinking any potion.  On top of that you'll have a ton of potion duration increase which means one swig of swallow can give you at least half your health if not more.  Also extra bombs because bombs are surprisingly useful.  Dimeritium or moon dust can turn some monsters into chumps.  Grapheshot actually hurts Griffins.  You should always check your bestiary to see what monsters are weak to.   The guy above talked about learning to dodge and roll.  This is very important.  Most monster attacks are better avoided with the quick dodge, but some require the roll.  Between those two and default quen, you should be able to avoid taking most damage.  This is important because Witcher 3 combat basically boils down to dodging attacks and following up with a couple hits of your own.  If you can learn to do this, pretty much any skill build will work for you.  You could just put everything into the first two columns of the sword tree, put on feline armor and ursine swords and just carve everything to pieces.  But first you have to not get killed."

witcher,3e15t9,Cloymax,6,Tue Jul 21 12:37:44 2015 UTC,"Slow down, take a breather, and approach fights slowly.  Start on the normal difficulty (one step below Blood and Broken Bones).  Do you understand the Sign system?  Geralt has access to five magic Signs, described as follows:  Yrden - a magical trap that slows enemies in the circle.    Igni - a quick burst of fire that damages opponents and can cause them to catch on fire.    Quen - a magical shield that blocks a single hit of damage (or multiple weak hits).    Aard - Think force push from Star Wars.    Axii - A temporary stun/mind control.  To use a Sign, you must have full Stamina (or adrenaline if you have the perk).  Select the Sign and press the button that you've bound to use magic.  The default for PC players is Q.    Fighting humans can be tough at first, but their attack patterns basically boil down to the weapon they're using.  Enemies that attack with a one-handed weapon can be blocked by holding your block button.  Enemies that utilize a two-handed weapon cannot be blocked, so your best bet here is to dodge.  You have two dodges available to you.  One is a quick step in the direction that you're moving and the other is a long roll.  Try to use the roll to escape if you're surrounded.  Otherwise, time your dodges properly to evade enemy strikes.    You have two sword styles available at any time.  There's fast attacks and strong attacks.  On harder difficulties (not sure about lower difficulties, as I've only played on the hardest), if you try to attack blocking humans with too many fast attacks, they'll shove you back and you'll have to dodge to evade their next strike.  I prefer to mix fast attacks and signs to keep dealing damage, but you can use a mixture of strong attacks/fast attacks/signs.  To give you an idea of what an experienced player looks like, check out this link really quick.  See if you can take from some of that gameplay.  In essence, you should always stay moving.  I like to strike once or twice, dodge, and then use signs or continue striking.  If you do one thing for too long, the AI will adapt and overpower you.  Keep switching things up and always stay moving."
witcher,3e15t9,Cloymax,3,Tue Jul 21 04:20:25 2015 UTC,"Damn so it does adapt. Seems like because of my strategy handicap I'm always button mashing trying to out-sign, slash, and dive.   I do okay but I'll get hit by an arrow and half my health is gone. Then someone clips me as I roll by. But I have no potions to heal as well."
witcher,3e15t9,ManCubb,5,Tue Jul 21 04:32:39 2015 UTC,You start with a recipe for Swallow.  Find the ingredients and restock it whenever you run out (meditating restocks potions if you have some form of pure Alcohol available - collect Alcohest).

witcher,3e15t9,xtotheh,7,Tue Jul 21 04:34:18 2015 UTC,Ignore ranged weapons apart from when fighting underwater or if youre fighting flying enemies. It does pitiful damage. Underwater it gets a riddicolous boost to damage. Flying enemies hit by bolts fall to the ground.
witcher,3e15t9,xtotheh,4,Tue Jul 21 05:16:25 2015 UTC,"I'm brand new to the Witcher series, and I totally understand where you're coming from. My first few hours of gameplay were fraught with frustration as I just could not handle combat and was continuously dying. So, I watched online combat tutorials, and read through some very detailed ""tips and tricks"" guides on this subreddit.   It took a bit to become more comfortable with my fighting ability, and I'm still learning how to better handle crowds of enemy, but my game experience has really blossomed with the more I use the tools available to Geralt. Oils and potions are very helpful in fights, as are the different bombs you can create. But perhaps nothing has proven more instrumental to me in my becoming a better fighter than my use of the magic signs, specifically Quen.   I fear i am still too new a Witcher to offer you my own advice as to how best to fight, as I myself am still learning. But, I would tell you this: do not give up on the game. It's like a light switch flipping on, when you become efficient at combat, getting better as you play, ranking up in levels and unlocking and building stronger powers. You become death incarnate in battle. As this has been happening for me I went from barely enjoying the game to having one of the best experiences with a video game that I have ever had.

Add that to I was preparing for the battle and then meditating, not realising that wiped out all the preparations, and I got slaughtered about 20 times. Read a how to kill her, found out I was doing everything wrong and nailed her next time out. Which was hugely satisfying."

witcher,3e15t9,Duarian,2,Tue Jul 21 06:01:14 2015 UTC,How does Quen work? Its like a one-hit shield? I'll try it later. I remember using it in the tutorial but I switched to Igni because it lights groups on fire and let's me focus on one target.
witcher,3e15t9,bipbophil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:03 2015 UTC,Yea it's base function is a shield that protects from a couple small hits or one big hit but once you upgrade you can get an active force field shield that absorbs damage and replenishes your vitality and damages the enemy it's amazing
witcher,3e15t9,heudss,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly the combat system just takes some getting used to. Like, you can't just spam ""x""/fast attack through groups of enemies, you have to be a little more strategic (I'm sure you've noticed this). Personally I'm on my second play through on death march and I never use oils (I always forget), but by know I just know how to approach different fights.

Didn't use oils once, and rarely used a potion that wasn't Swallow (healing)  If you don't understand crafting, don't use it. It's not necessary at all until later. You're only ever gonna use crafting to craft ""witcher gear"" anyways. You don't need to craft or buy anything that isn't witcher gear, just pick it up off of dead guys.  As for alchemy, gather the ingredients for the ""Swallow"" potion. That's the healing one. You can refill it by meditating while having alcohest or dwarven spirit in your inventory.  I know my advice basically boils down to ""ignore it until later"" but the first step is to have fun. Understanding more complex mechanics comes later.  And for combat: Roll and dodge a lot, try to take enemies one on one, and use the Quen sign as often as you can."

Cross reference the monster in the bestiary to determine the oil it is weak to.    I don't understand alchemy or crafting   Well, there are all sorts of craft-able items.  Oils, Bombs, Potions, Decoctions, Weapons, Armor You can equip two bombs.  These are generally throw-able grenades. Potions provide effects like healing, night visions, the ability to hold your breath longer, and many many others. Decoctions are essentially potions that enhance abilities, just a different kind of potion derived from monster mutagens generally. Armor and weapons should be self explanatory.  In general you need just the components to craft alchemy items. For Weapons and armor you also need to work with an artisan of the appropriate skill level.  You can acquire advanced schematics for most Alchemy items to make improved version of the base types (not decoctions tho) and for Witcher Weapons and Armor  The Crafting interface as of version 1.07 has the ability to pin a schematic so when you go to a shop you can have the needed ingredients highlighted.    I don't even understand the health system or how I'm supposed to fucking heal.   Two potions are dedicated to healing.  Raffards (something) and Swallow.

witcher,3dxyc1,take5b,12,Mon Jul 20 13:20:14 2015 UTC,"Hardest part for me on my death March run was this part. Bloody wraiths ganging up on you. Try to conserve health regen potions, eat food between first and second wave. Use yrden. Try and isolate wraiths and fight them one at a time. Very hard, I know. Honestly I only got through it by persisting through multiple deaths. Roll around a lot so u don't get swarmed, but don't go too far from the Baron or the quest fails. I wish there was a checkpoint between the first and second wave of wraiths. Anyway, good luck with it.  Oh and switching to gear that gives you more vitality helps. Theres a pair of trousers that gives 150-200 hp that you can find. Use spectre oil too and thunderbolt so you can kill in few hits as possible."
witcher,3dxyc1,timehoodie89,2,Mon Jul 20 13:40:20 2015 UTC,I've had the most success isolating Wraiths by finding the one closest to me and maintaining max leash distance so only he continues to chase. If you keep him in that dead zone between you two it should follow long enough to give you some distance from the group
witcher,3dxyc1,Platanium,7,Mon Jul 20 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"I somehow managed to complete this part (lubberkin option) on Death March on the first try. Here are my suggestions:   Spectre Oil. Every bit of damage helps. You'll have an opportunity to apply it before both waves of wraiths. Forget about Yrden and just focus on keeping Quen up, you can do sufficient damage to normal wraiths without Yrden. As soon as your Quen is broken, roll away and pop it again. Drinking Tawny Owl will allow you to pop Quen more often. Wraiths can be stunlocked pretty well by fast attacks. Focus on one wraith at a time and just spam fast attack until it dies or teleports away."
witcher,3dxyc1,inspektor71,4,Mon Jul 20 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is the best advice, dont use your stamina on yrden. If you really want the yrden effect, use bombs"
witcher,3dxyc1,Sleith,3,Mon Jul 20 14:25:08 2015 UTC,"I think I tried throwing a bomb a couple times and was immediately spammed by three wraiths from behind to death. But if I try again- it's Moon Dust I would need? (I'll double-check the bestiary).  I'm pretty sure I have spectre oil, certainly if I don't I'll get it, but I spent so much time yesterday on this my brain became a blur and I honestly don't remember if I used it. I know I tried cursed oil on the botchling itself, so it's possible I foolishly used cursed oil on wraiths (which begs the question- what happens when you use the WRONG oil? I'm guessing nothing).  How do you focus on one at a time when they're all teleporting all the time? Just ignore anyone with a full health bar?"
witcher,3dxyc1,inspektor71,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:25 2015 UTC,"Moon Dust would be the correct bomb but I'd avoid using bombs for the reason you mentioned (leaves you open to attacks). Using the wrong oil has no effect, I believe. As far as focusing on each wraith one at a time, it's tricky with all the teleporting they do but yeah, your goal is to reduce their numbers as quickly as possible by finishing off weakened ones first, as the fight will get easier and easier the less wraiths there are."

witcher,3dxyc1,Scylithe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:31 2015 UTC,"Forget about health regen (swallow). If you get hit with their lantern you're dead anyway.    So, your friends for this fight are: Spectre oil, Tawny Owl (nobody ever uses it but it's great!), Thunderbolt, Quen, Yrden.    Take some time on the first round of wraiths learning what it looks like when they do their lantern spinny-sword combo. You can never be hit by this, so recognize it and roll far away from it.    Now, onto the actual fight: Try to guess where one of the first wraiths will spawn, drop Yrden on it, pop your Thunderbolt, and kill it as fast as you can. If at any point you see more than two wraiths near you, roll away and drop another Yrden. If you manage to kill a couple of wraiths fairly quickly with your Thunderbolts, you should be able to dodge the rest fairly comfortably. Obviously keep Quen up all the time and prioritize it above all else. If at any point you find yourself unable to IMMEDIATELY re-quen or re-yrden, it's time to use a Tawny Owl. Don't forget your Tawny Owl.    Source: Hated this quest for a long time."
witcher,3dxyc1,Slumlord722,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"I also had a tough time with this.  I run a fast attack/potion build, but what got me through this rough patch was a lot of dodging. In fact any time I get a large pack of mobs, I dodge a lot. Wraiths are troublesome since they teleport, but it is doable. Basically I will hit them 2 or 3 times with fast attack, or a sign should work as well, and then dodge back or to the side, or both. I never stand still at all.  Basically, attack, attack, dodge, dodge, and cast Quen if I get hit.  Tawny owl helps a ton with stamina regen to keep quen up. Keep in mind dodge is better than rolling since it does not use Stamina, and 2 dodges will get you to the same point. If you dodge right or left instead of back, you will often be in a position to hit their flank as they lunge toward the spot you were.  Hope it helps a little bit."
witcher,3dxyc1,malacor17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:00 2015 UTC,"Ok lots of great advice here, and sifting through it and stacking it up against what I already tried, I think my strategy will be:   Level up as much as possible. I still don't know how exactly- there's a only a couple of side missions left in my quest log that are at my level, but I'll see how far I can get. Maybe even try to get Griffen witcher great, which I want anyway eventually because I'm focusing on signs. Tawny owl, thunderbolt and spectre oil, which I've used before but probably didn't focus on enough. As always, Quen all the time forever, drop a Yrden when I can. Dodging when near one or two wraiths, to save stamina, rolling when near more to avoid being ganged up on.   At this rate it'll be a long while until I beat it but if this is the hardest part of the game, will be worth it."
witcher,3dxyc1,CienkiHipek,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:33 2015 UTC,"I'm curious... You are using alternate Ydren, right? The shots basically stun lock a Wraith for you so that you can roll behind it, hit it a few times and dodge again. You do not need normal Ydren up to reveal spectres, alternate also reveals them. I didn't find this part hard at all and I also went a signs build.  I'm confused about people telling you Ydren is useless. It is by far the best single target sign in the game. Keep it down, put up a normal Quen shield, hit, hit, hit, repeat."

witcher,3dxyc1,plspirit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:07 2015 UTC,"For my 2nd playthrough I was rushing through the game on the DM difficulty. I got to the botchling part at level... 4. Signs build as well, most points put into Igni (which is useless against wraiths). It was pretty tough but this is how I managed to do it (accidentally killed the botchling because I wandered too far off). 1. Yrden is not essential. 2. Dispatch the botchling first. I was lucky that Igni is really good for it. 3. My priority was to avoid the 2-hit combo from the wraiths. It's a lot of damage. If you miss your dodge or roll and then get combo'ed by 2 wraiths, you're dead. 4. Try to separate the wraiths. Fighting in corners worked for me, I'd get 1-2 wraiths most of the time. When I had more than 2 wraiths on me, I just rolled away. 5. Try to keep Quen active or just dodge like a pro. 6. I used Aard occassionally to stagger the wraiths. 7. Use quick attacks to prevent the wraith from attacking you. 8. I used the only decoction I had (Griffin). Not sure it's useful but I thought that every little bit might help. Also used food and Swallow.  Most importantly, keep cool, focus and try to not get annoyed. Not getting annoyed was hard for me. Weather effects + playing on PS4 + clunky-ish combat = me pissed off. ;D    One more note, since you also went for a signs build. Igni will make the game pretty easy until you reach Imlerith. Respec beforehand (i.e. before going to the Isle of the Mists) or get ready for a tough fight. Wish I had known that. :)"
witcher,3dxyc1,sevendots,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"When you say ""dispatch the botchling first,"" do you mean at the beginning to choose the option ""attack the botchling"" instead of ""turni the botchling into the lumpkin?"" Because then you end with 3 wraiths AND botchling which is impossible.  I could handle the botchling by itself (which is how that option starts). I could handle 3 wraiths, maybe 4. It's that the mission gives you either 3-4 wraiths AND a botchlings or 4 wraiths THEN ANOTHER 4 wraiths in a tight area that is killing me.  The corner idea is interesting... does that make it impossible for wraiths to appear behind you because there is no behind you?"
witcher,3dxyc1,MaxSalvatore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:22:41 2015 UTC,"I picked the escort option, but at the 2nd set of wraiths I wandered too far off (while rolling/dodging to stay alive). It turns out that if you go to far away from the Baron, the botchling breaks free and transforms anyway. So essentially I had like 4 wraiths and the botchling which then summoned more wraiths for it's phase two.    Fighting in the corners may be tricky, remember to save some room for a roll."

This is how I beat it.   Abuse quen and cast arden. Use all your food if u have to. I went through like 10 raw meats and all my swallow potions. Use tawny oil so you can cast more quen and arden. Only attack the wraithes when they are inside the yrden circle. Eventually you will beat it it's hard but not impossible. I was level 6 when I beat it.

Just be thankful you didn't go the Kill The Botchling route, because it gets much more difficult after that part. Partial Spoilers below, but I'll keep it vague  First time on Broken Bones I had a very tough time finishing the quest while walking with the Baron. I ended up having to complete it at a higher level (probably 7 or 8). Well, now I'm on Death March and I wanted to try the other ending, so I'm trying to kill the botchling. Doesn't happen- I rage quit about 3 times, then decided to play other missions and level up. Now I'm level 9, and I can get the botchling/wraiths pretty easily, but wait, there's more! After that is over, there are many, many more wraiths to deal with. Here I am at Level 9, second time through, and I can't complete the second half to this Level 6 mission after Spectre oil / Quen spamming.   Rage quit again. The kicker is that if you read a guide on how to beat the mission, the easiest way is to essentially avoid fighting and to run away. What a joke!  For all the praise Witcher 3 gets, I can't get over how fucking terrible the difficulty curve is. It's either seemingly impossible like this mission, or ridiculously fucking easy. Only a handful of missions hit that sweet spot.  /rant"

witcher,3e0y7b,royallyfaithfulspoon,2,Tue Jul 21 05:10:18 2015 UTC,"The Witcher 1 has a lot of problems. The voice acting is inconsistent, sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Gameplay has a lot of ""old"" to it:   Kinda limited inventory space.   LOTS LOTS LOTS of backtracking with respawning monsters in your way. You can ignore them but Geralt doesn't run fast. He is very fast in TW3.  Many quests are not explained that well, some are bugged. It's likely that you will hit guides more than once.  The combat is pretty terrible. The skill tree isn't good either.  Some mechanics are bittersweet like drinking. You can get drunk with characters and get cool rewards like information, items and funny dialog. The problem is, you will to stumble (at a very slow speed) towards a meditation point while drunk. Sometimes you won't be close to any meditation point.  You can't meditate anywhere. At the beginning you will struggle looking for places to meditate.  That's all the bad things I can think off. I played up until the 2nd act and left it there to read the books instead.  The Witcher 2 is incredible and a great game that unfortunately was overshadowed by Skyrim. It's very similar to TW3 in many aspects, great graphics, story, voice acting and fast combat. The combat can be a bit frustrating in higher difficulties in some fights because of the difficulty.  It still has its share of problems but nothing like TW1.   Inventory isn't that good. Now that I think about it, the inventory has problems in all the games.  The books are VERY easy to get into. I'm mid way through the 2nd book of short stories and I love it. When you start reading, you will imagine Geralt from the games doing all the stuff. It's like in game cutscenes in text mode.  I won't spoiler anything but you will see a new side of Geralt that isn't really that present in the game.  I know I talked a lot of shit about the first game but I'm just being honest. I recommend you to play on the easiest difficulty to enjoy the story and get over with it quickly to start enjoying TW2.

Relax a bit, get a warm bath or a massage and the pain should go away pretty fast."

witcher,3e0sct,wittyshins,11,Tue Jul 21 02:03:30 2015 UTC,I thought they were tedious because they are so easy by just using counterattack spam that you will never take damage from any opponent. Maybe you're just mad cus bad?
witcher,3e0sct,DemusGW2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:22 2015 UTC,"OP is probably trying to make it more realistic with more dodging and different techniques than necessary, rather than just spamming block/counter.  It's a big let down once you figure out how easy it is to block, counter attack once or twice, dodge backwards, repeat."
witcher,3e0sct,sevendots,2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:26 2015 UTC,"They are ridiculous. Ridiculously easy. All I do is block until I can get some distance away and release block so you can counter the next hit. Counter, strong attack, light x2, dodge back. Repeat till dead.

Overall the ending is very happy. Couldn't be more happy, except for the fact that the baron died. ;_; Maybe if Ciri stayed with Geralt and became a Witcher, but things just didn't turn out like that...

It was so horribly sad.  Edit:   The wording of my post was a little off. Felt like i was too pissed and angry about being at Kaer Morhen while that isn't really the point.  I felt sad because of the ending cutscenes, everything ended there. No more having fun with Ciri, no more seeing the characters you love. The endings were all sad and beautiful in their own ways, and when you think about what it took you to get there, it really feels like a real adventure that greets you with a peaceful moment at the end. No rushing to do things.  Empty Kaer Morhen was peaceful. Problem is, i was crying like a little kid, quicksaved and left the game for a good little while because the endings hit me right in the feels. Then i came back and Yen, Triss, Dandelion, Zoltan and other friends were nowhere to be found.

My only real complaint about ME so far (I'm at the second) is that if you get paragon points then any blue or top right dialogue option pretty much becomes a win button if you just want to grind the ""proper"" options.  Good thing that I'm playing as a paragon with a dash of renegade then! If anyone else is planning on playing ME, then I have two things to say to you:     Don't try to min/max your stats and get as many paragon points as possible (or renegade if your taking that route), but just roleplay and be an ass towards the people you feel like being an ass to. Try not to skip ME1. The story is great and there's some nice music. It holds up pretty damn well still and rag dolling people with the Mako is my favorite thing ever in an RPG vehicle section.     Try this mod for ME1: http://www.moddb.com/mods/mass-effect-1-new-texture-updatesimprovements-mod  And this mod for ME2, if you miss the thermal cooldown: http://www.moddb.com/mods/eudaimonium  This mod is a pretty good alternative to the one above (only install one!): http://www.moddb.com/mods/better-me2  (Edit: added links)"

witcher,3duwq9,Glaedr304,29,Mon Jul 20 14:44:56 2015 UTC,"Spoilers  I had the opposite experience.  The ending was bittersweet but after it was over, I was at an empty Kaer Morhen at about 10 in the morning. Geralt was in Master wolf trousers and boots and a plain white shirt. No weapons or equipment or gloves. I just proceeded to walk through Kaer Morhen and take in the sights.  Instead of feeling sad, it was very peaceful and kind of ethereal in way.  I thought it was a brilliant ending.  Here was his home which had been crumbling all along and now he had moved on. Coming back to it felt nostalgic. I walked down to the main gate, that the battle had ripped holes into and watched the dust fall in the sunlight that streaked through. I walked out slowly and down the path south to the river and followed its edge to the waterfall admiring the mountains and the mist.  I thought it was a great way to uncompress everything that happened so quickly. Vesemir, Keira, Triss, Yen, Dandelion, Ciri, the en Craetes, Vizima, the Baron. Everything in the game always felt wounded and frantic and panicked, rushing from here to there. Always something to do. Here was a moment where there was no quests or alerts. Just mountains and rivers and trees and wind and a beautifully melancholy/cheerful song.  I made it right to edge of the map (walking the whole way) until it told me I'd gone too far. The map came up and I turned off the game.  It was a very fitting ending to an epic, entertaining, tragic, violent and thrilling adventure. Kind of felt like breathing out after holding your breath for so long.  I didn't feel sad at all. I felt...I dunno, at peace. It's one of my favorite video game endings ever. Battling the Hunt, running to the collapsing tower, Ciri in the void, chatting in a snowy village, the day with Ciri and the sad parting and then the walk through Kaer Morhen. It was brilliant. I think so anyway"

witcher,3duwq9,VictorsMod,2,Mon Jul 20 09:13:02 2015 UTC,yeah that all would be cool but listen it would require a lot - a lot - of work from developers on something that happens after the end of the actual game. i think we're just spoiled brats that will never be satisfied. it wouldn't be very reasonable. the game has ended.

I think I'll have to youtube the rest of the endings, but I think I got the 'happy ciri' one.   All smiles and a round of applause when the game cut to credits. That was without a doubt the best RPG I have ever played. I was a little disappointed that I fucked up the Yennifer and Triss romances, but it was my own doing.   Now to finally have a little break before the expansions come out. =)"

witcher,3duwq9,Zuqoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:58:37 2015 UTC,"The first play-trough is what really happened IMHO, any replaying after that will never give you the same experience.  E.g. I had three people die in the final mission of mass effect 2 and that emotional sucker-punch will stay with me forever. And I'm fine with that, it made the whole experience so much more memorable.  Same with the witcher 3, the ending I got was the result of me making decisions without knowing their consequences. I was very careful in making these decisions (especially after the me2 experience :) and I'm totally satisfied with the ending I got."

I can't catch up with my cohorts and see them in their new lives, which, I feel would have made the game just that much more rewarding.

witcher,3duwq9,dbdanny,7,Sun Jul 19 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah it's an excellent game, not as good as 3 in most respects (but then again, what is?). It will take u a while to get used to it as it's a bit different than 3, but all in all it's well worth the money (also it's shorter than 3 so it's no nearly as much of a time-sink). For lore's sake you might want to start from the first game, which is a lot more of an action game than an rpg in most respects, and it's a bit dated by today's standards, but all in all it's a good game as well."
witcher,3duwq9,MeshesAreConfusing,3,Sun Jul 19 19:07:38 2015 UTC,"I'll buy both, thanks!"
witcher,3duwq9,lazybones27,4,Sun Jul 19 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"If my opinion is worth anything, TW1 is not necessary to the story at all. If you can't get past the dated gameplay it's ok to skip it."
witcher,3duwq9,almox21,2,Sun Jul 19 23:31:56 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I just finished it recently myself. You could get away with skipping it. Just read a summary or something and maybe watch the final cutscene which is what sets up the second game. Of course events during the story will be referenced but you don't need to play it. I enjoyed the first game more than I thought I would but still struggled at times. It looks and feels different from 2 and 3 which are kinda similar. At some points it didn't even feel like a Witcher game.
witcher,3duwq9,Mekeji,9,Mon Jul 20 03:29:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Witcher 3 is like going to another country, meeting all kinds of amazing people, doing amazing things with these amazing people, and then they leave. Much crying because I wanted to spend a little more time with these people."

Now I feel empty. :( I wish there was atleast a longer epilogue, where Geralt goes around talking to important characters, just so there would be more closure...

witcher,3duwq9,BearDidIt,2,Mon Jul 20 15:34:47 2015 UTC,Definitely agree. That ending in ME was so bitter sweet and I loved it. There was a couple of times I thought they were doing it in this game like in my ending Dandelion and Zoltan were are a tavern with Triss but you couldn't say much and Triss didn't speak at all. The Khaer Mohen scene felt like this too (the drinking scene haha).
witcher,3duwq9,Parsley_Sage,7,Tue Jul 21 02:33:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah the empty Kaer Morhen was beyond depressing. It would've been nice if they plopped you down somewhere else among friends or something. Like maybe depending on your ending, say you end up with Triss in Kovir, have their house be like the palace in Vizima where the door out is a fast travel point. Same thing with Yen. The empty Kaer Morhen spawn shouldve only happened for people who fucked up and ended up alone.  Then whichever lady you end up with, as you go to use the fast travel point out of your house, she can stop you and ask ""Where are you going?"" and then the only dialogue option will be ""To play Gwent!""."

There have been rumors of a Witcher 4 that would not have Geralt as the protagonist (presumably like Bioware is doing with Mass Effect: Andromeda). Also the load screen I got when I loaded an old save in the epilogue said something about Ciri's story being far from over. Maybe next Witcher game has her as the protagonist?  If they do make Witcher 4 though it will likely not come out for quite some time as they have TW3 expansions to work on, plus CyberPunk 2077."

I want to spend as much time in that universe as I can. We have CyberPunk 2077 to look forward to though, if its even half as good as the Witcher games we will be in for a good time.

I would really enjoy not having to continually open world map just to check I'm walking in the right direction!
witcher,3dvf65,boldemort,6,Sun Jul 19 22:36:02 2015 UTC,Yeah its really frustrating because on GTA a simple tap and you can see much further to get a better understanding which path to take. I'd appreciate this on Witcher especially when the game route cocks up.

witcher,3e0j09,Magold86,2,Tue Jul 21 00:47:46 2015 UTC,"Consider playing on one of the two higher difficulties. The game becomes a little too easy later. I'm relatively new to gaming and I played on Blood and Broken Bones with no significant difficulty. I wish I'd done Death March.  If you're ever having difficulty, abuse the Quen sign. It's very good.  You might want to plan out your build a little bit ahead of time. There are four sets of Witcher armor, each are suited to a different play style. Feline armor for fast attack build, Griffin armor for sign build, wolven armor for sign/sword hybrid build, ursine armor for heavy attack build.  Side quests involving major characters can impact the main story and the ending of the game. Don't neglect them. Plus they're really fun.  People on this subreddit LOVE Gwent (the card game). I have never been able to get into it myself, but I would definitely recommend you try it out to see if it's your thing.  Be smart with your saves. Save often, but keep a few older saves in case of glitches or poor decisions.  Decisions that you make in this game matter, so don't make decisions lightly. Especially near the end, there are some minor decisions that can majorly impact your game.  Explore a bit, but don't feel like you have to hit every question mark on the map if that's not your thing. If it is your thing, you're in luck! There is a lot to explore."

But ill keep it in mind as to which route i want to go. I typically like quick attack/up close type combat and spells/magic stuff, so wolven may be a good choice.   Thanks for the tips."
witcher,3e0j09,GuessWhatIGot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:24 2015 UTC,"Gwent is awesome. If you want to collect the achievement, I suggest you start at the beginning.  Go wild with side quests. Comeplete as many as you can. A lot of them are incredibly in depth and it almost feels like a separate story line sometimes. I recommend them.  Don't focus too much on crafting weapons at the beginning. It never takes too long to come across a weapon better than what you've got.  The most important thing I'll say is, don't bother listening to any of this. The game is meant to be a sort of aimless adventure, and it does a fantastic job at that. Just play your own way with your own choices and enjoy the consequences. That is what is so amazing about the game. It's tailored to everyone and the type of choices they'll make."

I am definitely an achievement hunter, so ill be brushing up on those skills as time goes on. And thanks for the aimless wandering tip. Its pretty overwhelming all the stuff available to me at the start, so sometimes wandering is the best option."
witcher,3e0j09,Sayne86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"Enemies with a Red Skull or ??? by their name are significantly higher level than you.    What that means is that in Witcher 3 they get an artificial health boost (something like 300% or more for ??? enemies) and receive a similar damage bonus against you.  Conversely, you receive a damage penalty against them.  Be wary and be careful.    Large monsters significantly above your level can one-shot you and you do next to no damage against them."

Also, why would I downvote you just because I don't like the submission? That's not what it's used for. All I'm saying is that this subreddit constantly posts submissions involving Geralt sliding down a mountain or some shit.

I read his new novel when it came out in april - and to be honest, it was a fun read but also felt a little like he threw together some manuscripts from his desk drawers just for the sake of releasing a new book.

witcher,3duc7w,vipr9,175,Sun Jul 19 15:38:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of people actually don't like it because it makes Geralt less pretty for dialogue, but personally I think it's cool.   It shows that these potions are the real fucking deal and that they'd fuck up a normal dude."
witcher,3duc7w,Slumlord722,55,Sun Jul 19 15:51:42 2015 UTC,"If they think that, all they have to do is meditate 1 hr and it's gone. I think it's cool since usually it means you just finished some ass whoopin and everyone will know it."
witcher,3duc7w,SzyjeCzapki,39,Sun Jul 19 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"I remember before the game released, I made a thread about how it would be cool if Geralt's face in W3 changed based on his toxicity level. It was already done in the W2 engine as seen in the ""52 and a half"" video.  One week later an article gets uploaded, showcasing the changes on Geralt's face when he gets poisoned.  I was a happy man."
witcher,3duc7w,ginja_ninja,10,Sun Jul 19 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"Of course then you're wasting an alcohest to replenish like one use of a potion and one decoction instead of waiting until you've used more up. Not really a problem as you can amass a huge supply of alcohol pretty quickly, but I do wish they'd have a yes/no ""do you want to refill your stuff"" when you meditate to have more control over it."
witcher,3duc7w,lebouffon88,12,Sun Jul 19 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"I agree completely with this! Or, maybe let us choose which alcohol we want to use.. ==. I'm running out of alcohest but having more than 200 Dwarven spirits!"
witcher,3duc7w,IratusTaurus,2,Sun Jul 19 21:47:13 2015 UTC,Does it make a difference if they're being replenished by Alcohest rather than dwarvern spirit?
witcher,3duc7w,lebouffon88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:37:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I think so. But I don't want that, when I need to brew a new potion, that I realized that I don't have any alcohest anymore. It's better to have 50 alcohest and 50 dwarven spirit rather than having 200 dwarven spirit and 0 alcohest."
witcher,3duc7w,BSRussell,0,Mon Jul 20 11:51:48 2015 UTC,"No it's not, they are exactly the same."
witcher,3duc7w,lebouffon88,0,Mon Jul 20 14:36:52 2015 UTC,"No it's not. When you need to make or brew a certain (new) potions, you would need alcohest. If you haven't alcohest, you would have to look around and buy it. Not that it's troublesome to find, but it would be easier if you have both of them on you."
witcher,3duc7w,BSRussell,4,Mon Jul 20 14:50:16 2015 UTC,"Okay fair enough, but given how extremely rarely you make new potions versus how often you rebrew, plus the fact that Alcohest is readily available for free/cheap all the time, you'd really rather have 50 of each than 200 dwarven spirit?  You'll rebrew like 50 times for every one time you make a new potion."
witcher,3duc7w,carrot0101,5,Mon Jul 20 14:54:34 2015 UTC,Or get some of that white honey.
witcher,3duc7w,dodgysmalls,9,Sun Jul 19 21:24:33 2015 UTC,"There are several story sequences where this is impossible as combat ending immediately triggers dialogue. Some of these scenes are flagged to automatically return geralt's face to normal, but then subsequently triggered conversations are not.  I think, at least in an older patch, the scene with spoiler Geralt's face would still be deranged, which was pretty inappropriate."
witcher,3duc7w,Lurtz_Of_Orthanc,7,Sun Jul 19 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's times like that where I love having the toxicity face the most. My favorite thing about Mass Effect 2 was if you played a pure renegade, you'd end up with terminator eyes and fiery facial scarring. Super eerie and super fun to play as. The more scarred and terrifying Geralt/the player character looks, the happier I am as a player."
witcher,3duc7w,deeplywombat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:21:55 2015 UTC,Did they patch that out? I remember being annoyed with it in that specific scene.

It's too much."
witcher,3duc7w,gtabro,14,Sun Jul 19 22:54:13 2015 UTC,"Little grim details like these is what makes TW3 more mature than Dragon Age, and I can't love it anymore."
witcher,3duc7w,FruitlessVenture,14,Sun Jul 19 16:16:48 2015 UTC,"What makes TW games more mature than Bioware games is that they can tackle adult themes in an adult game like rape, social injustice, wife beating etc, and not tip-toe around it, belittle it, or colour it in any way. CDPR respects their customers enough to treat them like adults, and that makes me happy."
witcher,3duc7w,el_padlina,2,Sun Jul 19 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"And that's why I can't wait for Cyberpunk 2077 to come out. From the little information there is about it, it will be that kind of adult game.  And that just reminded me of the Blade Runner game."
witcher,3duc7w,Impul5,2,Mon Jul 20 12:26:02 2015 UTC,"It's a really cool touch, but it's a bit awkward on a 1st-time playthrough when Yen shows up out of nowhere for a romance chapter and suddenly every cutscene makes you look like an enemy straight out of DooM."

For me the ideal would be if his face looked like this immediately after his toxicity spiked, but then the effect would fade back to normal in a few seconds - just like in the opening cinematic of Witcher 1, and in Witcher 3's night to remember trailer.  As is I'm bothered by the persistence of the effect, and the randomness by which its applied, as it seems to appear/disappear randomly from loads and dialogues initiated when tox is up.  So I'm glad you made the mod djkovrik, to just get rid of it altogether."

witcher,3dw84h,BarelyLegalAlien,5,Mon Jul 20 01:47:32 2015 UTC,The fucking quest log
witcher,3dyazh,Merchyy,7,Mon Jul 20 15:03:36 2015 UTC,In all seriousness be happy you got that ending.  I got the super shitty one and had to load in.   I then spent a month fixing my mistakes to get to where you are.
witcher,3dyazh,ozman51,7,Mon Jul 20 15:06:21 2015 UTC,"I got the shitty ending where Geralt dies alone as a witcher, lonely and without anyone after Ciri leaves.  Putting me back in an empty Kaer Morhen when I knew that was Geralt's fate made me immediately close the game and never touch those saves."
witcher,3dyazh,BuggyVirus,2,Mon Jul 20 15:53:53 2015 UTC,Same here. I still feel empty inside.
witcher,3dyazh,yourbff,12,Mon Jul 20 18:46:46 2015 UTC,Still better then Mass Effect 3's ending though.
witcher,3dyazh,HafroThunder,4,Mon Jul 20 15:19:30 2015 UTC,"I think (and I made another thread about it) the main problem I have with this ending is that they really forced the whole white frost affair into it.  If Witcher 3 would just be about the Wild Hunt it would have been an epic ending, but all this white frost shit seemed unexplained and didn't make any sense (also a lot of open endings that seemed pointless like the crystal about trying to revive the lodge, philippa telling you what she will do when ciri gets the throne and stuff like that)"
witcher,3dyazh,Swarlsonegger,3,Mon Jul 20 16:21:35 2015 UTC,"I got the worst ending exept for Skellige Spoiler. The empty world is indeed depressing, you might want to take a break and go in it again or wait until the expansions come out."
witcher,3dyazh,Dwarvenmasterrace,3,Mon Jul 20 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"The ending felt pretty flat and empty to me. Eredin was way too easy to beat, even on death march. And the story all ends with the white frost. But the white frost was barely talked about during the whole game. If you never played a witcher game or read the books than you have almost no clue about it."
witcher,3dyazh,Dindzr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:31 2015 UTC,was anyone else annoyed how the game went back to how it was before the last chapter?  i know everyone had different endings but it would of been nice to see the changes or at least get some dialouge from npcs at what not
witcher,3dyazh,baddazoner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:19:08 2015 UTC,Like not being able to give the rose of remembrance to Triss after it bloomed   People keep saying this but I swear it looks the exact same the entire time. I would shut up if someone could show me a picture.

Yeah, being able to give it back to her would have been the deadly combo of being: (a) easy to do, and (b) meaningful. This is why (mostly for reason a - don't understimate how much this matters to devs, haha) I am thinking it might be a thing included in a future version of the game.   Edit: Nope, doesn't change."
witcher,3dyazh,SergeantSenpai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:28 2015 UTC,I personally didn't mind the endings. I do agree though.

C'mon, I'm probably the biggest Triss fan you'll ever meet and if that makes or breaks the ending for you that's just wrong."

witcher,3dz4xa,Rhua,0,Mon Jul 20 18:55:52 2015 UTC,Yes. $60 is too much to pay for a card game. Especially one that I can't even physically see before purchasing. The sets are tarot sized and can't be printed on a standard size printer.

witcher,3dy0ke,c0smic_sans,8,Mon Jul 20 13:40:40 2015 UTC,"Money early game is all about honeycombs. When you see one, use igni and loot them when they fall. The lady herbalist, Tomira, will pay a lot for them, and you can buy from her the stuff you need for alchemy in that area. Just loot everything and sell stuff to the ""appropriate"" guys: weapons to blacksmiths (the dwarf, Willis), armor-related stuff to armorers (the guy at the nilfgaardian camp), food to the herbalist Tomira.  The point is: don't rush. Take your time, try to understand. Try stuff, try everything. It can be confusing at the beginning (it has been for me too), but you will gain confidence eventually."
witcher,3dy0ke,The_LucKy_StriKe,4,Mon Jul 20 13:56:05 2015 UTC,Not sure why you were downvoted for this.  The honeycomb thing is told to you in game on the flier in White Orchard.  Like CDPR was actually nudging you to do this if you want crowns.    I ran around for 15-20 minutes in the area around the first herbalist in White Orchard collecting honeycombs and then used Honeycomb money to buy any mats from her I needed for potions I had to craft at the time.  She has a really solid inventory.
witcher,3dy0ke,DoctorP0nd,2,Mon Jul 20 17:04:33 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, random downvotes are just classic reddit stuff :)  Glad I could help, ask if you need something else :)"
witcher,3dy0ke,The_LucKy_StriKe,4,Mon Jul 20 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"Don't skip those weapons when you loot. Most vendors will buy them, but armorers and weaponsmiths will pay a little bit more. Since there's a lot of them available through drops, it can start to add up.   Overall, loot everything you find, sell the stuff you don't need."
witcher,3dy0ke,Mark_McQ,4,Mon Jul 20 13:46:35 2015 UTC,Is there an inventory cap? Or can you become overencumbered?
witcher,3dy0ke,vipr9,2,Mon Jul 20 13:47:26 2015 UTC,"yes you should see it on the top on your menu screen, you can increase it by buying saddlebags. In the beginning you won't even have to worry about it"
witcher,3dy0ke,slavabez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:38 2015 UTC,"You become over-encumbered.  Look for alchemists to buy potion/oil ingredients, some of them sell for peanuts. Some rarer crafting materials can be obtained by breaking down monster drops.  When fighting, master dodging. Against smaller monsters and humans Alt + direction will step sideways, which dodges the hit and allows for a quick counter-attack. Just got to time it right.  Against larger monsters and bosses that take long swings it's best to jump sideways (space + direction), although it takes that extra second to recover and stand up."
witcher,3dy0ke,Sabbathius,7,Mon Jul 20 13:59:51 2015 UTC,"Money is actually fairly irrelevant, you don't really need it for anything. And the higher level you get, the richer you get. By lvl 15 I had something like 15k and nothing to use it on.  Having said that, the key is to sell the right thing to the right vendor. Weapons/armors should be sold to weapon/armorsmiths, they pay more. Tomira (White Orchard Herbalist) and several others buy things are much higher prices than most other vendors. For example, Tomira buys honeycombs for 18 (16?) gold each. Other vendors buy it for around 8 each. By lvl 2, just running around White Orchard, I had around 40 honeycombs to sell, which is 720 gold just from that.  Some potions do require reagents you won't find early in the game. However, there's recipe reagents that cannot be harvested. They can only be bought, or found as loot. For example, Bison Grass. It won't appear in vendors' inventory until a certain level (10-12 I think?), and it can't be harvested. But it CAN be found as loot at various locations throughout Velen.  There's a few good vendors selling a lot of recipes in Velen. Both are hobbits. One lives in a Herbalist's Hut North-East of Oxenfurt. The other lives in Novigrad, South of Hierarch's Square, across the canal. The Oxenfurt hobbit sells all the basic bomb recipes. The Novigrad one has a lot of Enhanced recipes. And, their selection improves as you level up, though not every level.  About constantly resting, it's not a problem unless you use potions/decoctions/bombs between these rest periods. Otherwise, the used up potions/decoctions/bombs will get replenished with alcohol (alcohest/dwarven spirit/etc.) This means you'll be burning through the alcohol in your inventory really, really fast.   Depending on your level and spec, you don't really need to rest much. If you get improved Quen sign, it'll regenerate your health as the shield absorbs damage. If you get a second-tier talent in Alchemy, drinking any potion restores 25% of your health (so you can drink something like White Honey, and still get 25% heal). There's also many decoctions that restore health (Troll, Ekhidna, etc.), though those ones are typically later in the game."
witcher,3dy0ke,-squishi-,2,Mon Jul 20 13:57:46 2015 UTC,"Being poor is a design decision. Witchers are vilified in the game universe - you'll notice NPCs sometimes spit at you or send their children away so you won't steal them - so getting fair pay for your work is meant to be hard.   If you're really struggling with cash, always negotiate contract payouts when the dialog is available. The amount you can negotiate depends on the person you're talking to - peasants won't be able to budge much over the default, soldiers can sometimes afford a bit more and rich folk can afford the most.  Also be smart about who you sell loot too - a herbalist or alchemist will pay more for ingredients, an armourer more for armour etc. Also don't be too pushed about buying weapons and armour; you'll soon find yourself with more crafting diagrams than you know what to do with, and it's always much, much cheaper to craft than to buy.  Your best loot will rarely come from story missions - its the side quests that give the interesting stuff (often with a bit of back story!). Take your time and explore dungeons and mission areas- use your Witcher sense to highlight lootable objects."
witcher,3dy0ke,jengelke,2,Mon Jul 20 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"Loot everything and sell Armor to Armorsmiths, weapons to Blacksmiths and everything else to normal merchants. Early on, use Igni on beehives and sell them to the White Orchard herbalist. She will buy at a higher value. Leather skins also sell well and are heavy and usually not worth breaking down into crafting materials early on. Herbalists are usually the best location for specific ingredients. If you loot everything (crates, boxes, barrels, random herb spots) you will usually have a decent stock of stuff and only be missing a few items you could get at the Herbalist. There is at least one per area.   Bonus: Swallow (potion) and food are the best way to regen health. There is also a talent called Sun and Stars that will slowly regen health during the day. There are also decoctions that will aid in this and some higher level talents (Quen has a modification to heal), but they won't be as easily available at early levels."
witcher,3dy0ke,vipr9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:50 2015 UTC,"Both problems can be solved by doing the undiscovered locations (?). You'll find many crafting materials and gear to sell. AFAIK you can go through the whole game without picking any plants, herbalists sell everything. Downside to meditating constantly is it will always use an alcohol to replenish your potions, even just 1."
witcher,3dy0ke,zmey_gorinich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:50:39 2015 UTC,"Use the new feature of 1.07 which allows you to ""tag"" a recipe (while in the alchemy interface). Once a recipe is tagged, all of its ingredients get highlighted in the shop interface. So, when you talk to an herbalist, you can easily see what you need and what she has of that.  As for money: good tips submitted by others below. My personal: try to make it to Novigrad and Oxenburg while you are level 4. Smiths in those towns pay 2x more for weapons and armor than smiths in velen/white orchard. So, once you have a fast travel marker in the 2 cities you can quickly teleport there to offload your loot for much more cash than what you'd get in the badlands.  Also, keep an eye out for harpy diagram. It tends to come in as a random chest loot early (around level 4-6). Harpy is a level 37 silver sword. You can make it from regular loot and sell it to the city smiths for 1280 or so. That's a good amount for a low level character.  p.s. An easy way to get into the cities is to buy the pass from the black-market near the Novigrad bridge; if your axii is high enough you can get a good discount for the pass too. Alternatively: you can swim across. That can be a dangerous adventure at level 4 though."

witcher,3dy0ke,BiigDaddyDellta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:12 2015 UTC,"Looting and selling is how you'll earn the bulk of your gold. I actually get annoyed early in the game when I sell a pair of boots for 30 and get paid 20 for a contract. Yes you should try to sell weapons to blacksmiths and armor/clothes to armorists but I personally don't make it an iron rule because I'd have to fast travel back and forth finding them all the time.   I just sell whatever I don't need all the time.  This helps keep a steady cash-flow and my weight restriction down. Yes 1.07 introduced a storage chest but I don't plan on using it- I remember I tried that with Skyrim and never went back to it, I don't have patience or interest in detail inventory management.  For alchemy and crafting components, I generally just pick up whatever is convenient and if I'm in new or weird area I try to loot some herbs or whatever. Most stuff you can buy from herbalists and the like. Also some things need to be dismantled- like to get a ""monster eye"" you need to dismantle a ""nekkar eye"" or some crap like that. Really annoying.  If there's a specific ingredient you need and still can't find a google for it will probably help (that's how I found out about the monster eye nonsense).  Finally remember you're not supposed to be able to craft and brew everything at once. Sometimes you'll find diagrams for things that require ingredients you just will not have come across, and sometimes you can even craft things you're too low-level to use. The same way that you can come across some monster in the swamp with a read health bar meaning it will destroy your ass until you level up a bunch. That's just how this game is built, on purpose."

witcher,3dyuqh,cincytechguy,2,Mon Jul 20 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"Start a new game! Disable the minimap, turn off the music, and (maybe, if that's something you can get in to,) enjoy a whole different game. I never realized how much I relied on the minimap, and how much it made me miss the beautiful scenery. It's also pretty neat when you start to learn the roads by heart and can navigate around the world without a map."
witcher,3dyuqh,TheDerperer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:23 2015 UTC,I turned the music off long ago. Not because I hated it but I don't think there was enough of it. Too many repeats. I at a lot of MKX and Injistice still. South more brutal without music

witcher,3dwetx,Krantos,2,Mon Jul 20 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Fem Hawke, naturally some of the dialogue was forced and a bit cringe worthy but that's usually the case with Bioware games. And if you didn't stick with one of the three personality choices for the majority of the game, Hawke ended up sounding kind of bipolar...   That being said, Jo Wyatt was fantastic as Ciri."
witcher,3dwetx,capbrune,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"I guess part of my problem was I spent most of the game (DA2) comparing her to Jeni Hale, who voiced FemShep in Mass Effect, and that may be unfair to Jo Wyatt.   Likely it was as much the writing in DA2 as anything.   And yeah, I liked her a lot as Ciri."

It was not helping at all that a lot of things was spread across a lot of maps POI/Playable areas.  But again it's a matter of personal taste."
witcher,3dwetx,thecrius,8,Mon Jul 20 10:46:23 2015 UTC,"what i think really hurt the game was going ""open world"". DAI felt like a single player mmo gameplay wise, and the world felt very empty and lifeless sadly. the cutscenes, characters and story i loved however. i just really like seeing the relationships with your friends develop as the game goes on and what i always looked forward to the most was the companion quests and just speaking with all your crew after a main story mission to see how they react to it."

witcher,3dwetx,misswynter,-6,Mon Jul 20 14:36:25 2015 UTC,"I don't see the resemblance.   Besides, if Ciri was in Dragon Age, they would try to make her less attractive, because according to Bioware having attractive women in games is sexist."
witcher,3dwetx,_brave_sir_robin_,5,Mon Jul 20 02:41:09 2015 UTC,"Um... what? When has that ever been Bioware's policy? Bioware has a huge amount of attractive characters in their games, and just because some characters aren't doesn't somehow mean that they're standing for some sort of anti-sexist ideology."

Like I took the week off just for the witcher, but I kinda wish I would of played it over the course of a month, instead of a week.   With that said, I had a blast playing it a week straight though. It made me laugh and cry, literally. I made me think, gave me real life insights, and the combat system was fun!  Like... I don't feel that guilty... just that the experience was longer lasted. I work full time AND have college classes though. So I was lucky to play it!"

You do start out the initial dialogue with ""You look great."" And she says something along the lines of ""Its nice to see you."" Then you get to make a dialogue choice a few moments later one of which is ""You smell wonderful."" Which leads to the above.   I 100% agree though, totally my favorite quote from the game.
