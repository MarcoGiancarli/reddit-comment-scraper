jellybeantoes,3dw205,guspolly,3,Mon Jul 20 00:31:15 2015 UTC,"Imgur mirror: http://i.imgur.com/zccVsxM.jpg  More information: https://www.tinykittens.com  Original caption:  ¬´ Junebug and Cricket were born to a feral mama who was in foster care with us for 37 days. We learned so much observing Sloaney and her babies, and are documenting our adventures in fostering pregnant feral cats at http://tinykittens.com/ferals/fostering  We trapped mama Sloane right before she gave birth so she could have her babies in a safe environment, and so we could guarantee mom and babies would all be spayed and neutered.   A staggering 75% of kittens born outside don't survive longer than six months because of disease, predators and cruelty. We wanted to give Sloaney's babies the best possible chance at survival, and are thrilled to report that all four are thriving, super snugglers, and preparing to go to their forever homes this Friday.  Our new feral mama-to-be is Sisko, likely due in a week or two (it's pretty difficult to tell for sure). You can watch her LIVE 24/7 at https://livestream.com/tinykittens/sisko.   I'm sharing her experience hoping we can all gain a greater understanding of how to care more compassionately for pregnant feral cats.   If you decide to watch, please keep in mind that Sisko is feral -- essentially a wild animal -- and therefore the experience watching her will be much different than watching one of our tame mama cats. ¬ª"
