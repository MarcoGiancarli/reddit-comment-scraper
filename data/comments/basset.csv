basset,3e5pmu,dictate_this,3,Wed Jul 22 03:56:39 2015 UTC,First stop bathing him so often you are wrecking havoc on his natural oils and skin. Every 2-4 months at MAXIMUM  Next take him to the vet to have his anal glands checked to see if they need to be expressed. as well as his ears checks for yeast infections.  Has he been on the same diet this whole time where he smells? If the vet doesn't find a yeast infection or skin condition then you should move on to food intolerance or allergies from the dog food you feed him.
basset,3e5pmu,Watcher_woman,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:20:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I will certainly stop bathing him so often; I know I cannot be healthy for the little guy. I will check with the vent about the anal glands, however he has been recently and there was no mention of concern about those nor his ears. Because of my experience with the other hound, I'm pretty adamant about checking on those ears.  He has been on the same brand of food for approximately four months. Maybe this could be part of the culprit. Have you had any luck with certain brands of food, or those that don't contain specific ingredients that can cause odor (off the top of my head, corn related)?   I really appreciate you taking the time to write a response. All of these are great suggestions."
basset,3e5pmu,Watcher_woman,2,Wed Jul 22 04:42:19 2015 UTC,"We used to be on science diet. I know it's not the best brand in the world but it has consistent ingredients bag after bag and they tolerated it really well. Since moving to a small town it became harder to find so we switched to Pure Balance as it is available at the local walmart (yup, that rural and small of a town where walmart is all there is).  One main issue could be the meat protein you hound is eating. I know one ours can't handle pork in the slightest so we try and get only the chicken and rice formula.  You may want to look into Science diet small bites as that is easier for them to gobble up with less wolfing down larger chunks.   If you are hesitant to go with science diet because of the fillers, Nutro Max is highly recommended for sensitive stomachs and is relatively easy to get.  Either way try and get lamb or chicken if you can as those are generally well tolerated. Lamb may cause gas more than chicken but is often better received by picky eaters than chicken.  I would steer clear of Blue Buffalo as that is almost criminal in how expensive it is for what you get.  Hope that helps. Oh one more thing... if there is cat food anywhere nearby, make sure it is never in reach of your dog. Two of ours had terrible gastro distress when we had a cat."

basset,3e06vp,_jeth,2,Tue Jul 21 02:28:05 2015 UTC,"The crate training idea might help.  Would a calming collar be an option?  I got mine when she was 8 and she would sneak to the basement to go potty, and then in a split level duplex she would sneak downstairs to go potty.  Lower floors were a draw for some reason.  I never figured it out.    I don't really know how to solve it.  We were always hypervigilant but she would have accidents now and then.  I got really handy with the steam cleaner."

basset,3e06vp,mephistophelesdiabol,2,Tue Jul 21 04:33:22 2015 UTC,"We've had 3 bassets and 2 basset  mixed breeds over the past 15 years.  Dogs are definate creatures of habit, and respect & protect their territory / homes.  When you move, his territory is gone, he won't immediately accept the new house as his.  If I understand correctly, you used to take him out at your old house, now that territory, including his familar outside has changed, you're going to have to work with him to establish the new place is his place, and that the new outside area is his potty area and play area. Right now he maybe getting confused in thinking the outside is his home territory and inside is just an area.  You might try moving any #2's he does outside and show those to him outside to reinforce that outside is where that belongs.  Try taking him outside use any words or phrases you used to use when taking him out to go potty.  Praise him happy / excited when goes potty outside.  Be patient and try to not scold him unless you catch him in mid pee or poop, then tell him no and then take him outside.  If you scold him after the fact he won't be sure what he is getting scolded for."
basset,3e06vp,NurseAngela,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:59 2015 UTC,Have you tried going out with him? Maybe he's so used to being taken out that he's waiting go you to go with him and is having accidents when he can't hold it anymore.

He isn't anxious at all either; he sleeps on his back most of the time, almost always touching us, lets us rub his belly and play with his loose skin as much as we want and he cut down the whimpering by at least 90% - it's just so I get the door or if he can't find me, and he keeps it short at that.

I guess I lucked out. I picked my 7ish year old basset up from the pound last year, and she has been by far the easiest dog I've ever had. Everyone always assumes I've had her since she was a puppy. I have the feeling that she'll be the dog I'll be telling my grandkids about, you know, the dog you just never forget."
basset,3btina,Ninjacherry,2,Thu Jul 2 15:39:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't raise my basset as a puppy, but to be quite honest he is super good about not peeing or pooping in the apartment (unless he gets sick), better than any other dog I've ever had. He doesn't fit the lazy basset profile and is very, very active (he's 2 and a half) and needs lots of long walks... But he does whine. He's gotten better, but he knows that his sad face can get him things and he uses that to his advantage... Oh, and he is drooly. I guess that these guys do have overall common traits, but your basset could be very different :)"
basset,3btina,Icepop131,3,Thu Jul 2 05:22:45 2015 UTC,Wow them paws are wonderful and the positioning of the head-tilt is bordering on 'professional'!!  You obviously have a very intelligent hound there - he's gorgeous!

basset,3btina,PolishTea,5,Thu Jul 2 03:36:29 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that six weeks is young (he'll be 7 in 2 days), but that's when the lady was letting them go. :/  At least, he was already used to kibble and pretty independent from his mum when we went to make our pick (compared to his siblings). While he did have some anxiety and was trying to suckle a bit the first day or so at home, it seems to be gone by now - that's what I was most worried about and I'm now confident he'll be ok."

basset,3btoni,fc3sbob,3,Thu Jul 2 01:43:28 2015 UTC,"Basset hounds are very vocal dogs. I had two and both loved to announce everything. Usually loud sounds (i.e. babies crying, sibling fights, sirens, doorbells etc) will set them off. The best course I found is to respond to them. Tell them its ok in a calm voice, agree with them that its a loud sound, just straight up starting a conversation with them usually stopped them or calmed them down and they would forget about what had set them off."
basset,3btoni,TheElectricFishOrgy,2,Thu Jul 2 03:59:43 2015 UTC,Mine stopped from 9 months until he was 8 years old.  Now he likes to sing with me.  He had parvovirus at 9 months and just stopped.  I missed it. My poor old boy is 14 now and has an inoperable tumor in his cheek. 😔
basset,3btoni,chollon,2,Thu Jul 2 04:00:51 2015 UTC,Awww sounds like he's been through the 'wars' over the years.  But the fact that he has reached the grand age of 14 says an awful lot of the great owner he has.  Any pics of your buddy?

basset,3bd4n9,sara-ndipity,7,Sun Jun 28 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"When you lift her leathers, is the inner ear or surrounding tissues swollen or red? Does she yelp or pull away when you touch them?   I would talk to the shelter and explain to them your concerns and take her back to the vet. I feel like they need to clean her ears of all the buildup and cleanse them, and then do another treatment.   Also talk to them about wrapping her ears with a soft cotton cloth or kerchief to let her ears air/dry out. Maybe a half hour 3x a day. If you're comfortable reading a book or magazine you can hold them up for her while she naps beside you. (I've never met a basset who said no to cuddles).   Bassets have some gnarly smelling earwax and because of the nature of their leathers they do get stinky very quickly. We clean Lilly's out every 5-8 days.   She gets a bath using oatmeal shampoo once a week and that helps her coat and the tops of her leathers stay shiny and clean.   We also got her a smaller diameter bowl so her ears don't get sloppy or food stuck to them."
basset,3bd4n9,TheEthalea,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:46:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking- I was suprised that they didn't do that to begin with D: I told the shelter about my concerns and they basically said everything was fine and that the treatment would help; but i still feel like more is needed. There isn't any redness or pain, just earwax and smell. The wrapping use sounds good, I'll definitely try that! Thanks for the ideas and thoughts :)"
basset,3bd4n9,laurshel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:46:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, brownish wax usually indicates a fungal infection.  From MedicineNet: Brown to dark brown discharge with a distinct, pungent, ""fermenting"" odor usually means that your dog has a fungal ear infection. These infections, which are caused by yeast organisms, usually arise after exposure to moisture while swimming or being bathed. They can usually be corrected using the treatment outlined above, but substituting an antifungal lotion or ointment for the ear mite medication. This could include any of the human vaginal yeast infection medications, such as Monistat. Like a bacterial infection, the treatment should only be necessary for about ten to twelve days."
basset,3bd4n9,laurshel,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:15:58 2015 UTC,"That sounds like what it is! Hopefully Monistat helps, thank you!"

basset,3bd4n9,Piratedan200,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:37:28 2015 UTC,If the ear is red and sore it's for sure an infection.   Bassets always have really strong smelling ears.  I recommend a commercial ear wash and try and get out all of the gunk that's built up.  Then if it's still bad or you see anything icky over the counter polysporin ear drops for humans.   2-3 times a day for a week should help clear them up. Once the Bnt is done (2 weeks)
basset,3bd4n9,chkadii,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:16:59 2015 UTC,"No redness or soreness, weirdly enough, just smell and wax. Will definitely try that. Thanks so much for the advice!"
basset,3bd4n9,Dudleysdad,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:49:49 2015 UTC,"When we first got our basset, we cleaned her ears out a lot, and she ended up getting an infection.  What we found out is that you need to use a non-water based ear cleaner with bassets, because if you use the water ones, it causes fungal infections.  Talk to your vet and get a prescription strength one to get the infection cleared out, then find a good non-water based ear cleaner for regular use afterwards."
basset,3bd4n9,Katzeye,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"Ooh! That makes sense, I didn't even think of that. We'll defininity switch to something non-water-based. Thank you!!"
basset,3bd4n9,Lustkillsall,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:50:38 2015 UTC,"Other comments already mentioned some direct treatment options, and I definitely think she should go to the vet.  In addition to that, something that worked for one of my dogs was giving him plain yogurt occasionally.  Dogs seem to love it, and it can be semi-frozen in a kong.  Just not too much, because it can give them an upset stomach."
basset,3bd4n9,cricketmcfly,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"My basset always had this problem. Every couple days I would take a 50/50 mix of water and white vinegar, pour in his ears, let him shake out, then wipe off whatever came out. Repeat until the gunk quits coming out. The vinegar neutralizes the ph in their ears and helps clean up infections very well."

My Winston has to lay like this every time on the sofa but if I am sitting there he will press his face against my thigh or prop his chin on my knee and snore his head off.

basset,39mnfb,Ellen_Pao_is_a_cunt,4,Fri Jun 12 20:36:10 2015 UTC,"Bassets are super territorial, they view their family as their ""pack""  and If you threaten their ""pack""  watch out.    When I was a little girl (8 or 9,so 20+ years ago)  I was walking our first basset, he was older  slower, kinda fat.  And that day a bunch of older bullies (12 or 13) decided to pick on me.  Several of these people had been to my house and knew the dog was kinda slow and dumb.    Anyway they went to start pushing me around shove me down and my hound went from slow and droopy to vicious attack dog he bit two of the bullies and scared them off then took me home to my mom. He then napped for the rest of the day."
basset,39mnfb,NurseAngela,4,Sat Jun 13 18:10:36 2015 UTC,"Bassets are good watch dogs (""Hey!  Someone's walking past the house you should come check this out!""), they just aren't good guard dogs (""Seriously they're coming up to the door now, you got this?  Because I'm not sure if I should hide or them kisses."")  Gotta say though, if I were looking to break into a house and heard my basset puppy bark, I'd expect a 150lb beast on the other side of the door.  He's a little goofy string bean but he sounds like a Tibetan Mastiff."

basset,39gcsl,medic318,2,Fri Jun 12 01:56:09 2015 UTC,All to true. I have a 14 year old and I know these rules well. Wouldn't change him for anything.
basset,39gcsl,Desembler,6,Fri Jun 12 03:18:26 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind where you place items on a counter.  They are short dogs, but long enough to reach counter tops and tables.  Placing a plate of food near the edge of a counter can easily turn into an unexpected meal for them.    Lazy and dumb is a misconception that most people have.  I find that when Banjo is staring blankly at something, he's really working through a problem in his head.  They will ""alter"" the rules to skew them in their favor.  They can be very lazy, but don't think that they always are.  There are days that Banjo will sleep for most of the day and all night. Other days he is hyperactive and constantly moving.  It's already been said, but it can never be mentioned enough; prepare for drool.  Lots of drool.    Be careful when letting them outside.  The nose rules all.  I can have him obeying me to a T, but as soon as that nose catches a scent, I don't exist anymore.  They will lock onto a scent and completely block out the world.  It's not uncommon for them to get out and track a smell for miles, then wind up lost.  If you let them out, keep in mind where they are going.  Lastly, prepare yourself for endless entertainment.  Random laps around the house (Basset 500) Bouts of barking at the wall or howling.  Odd sleeping positions, and my personal favorite, when they sit on their butt and their back legs prop up in the air."

She was pretty wild she only was able to play with the big dogs in puppy class. Of course her very first friend was an American bulldog that was full-sized ""Buddy"" who would let her do anything.   Also don't feed people food. Stella never ate anything but dog food and dog treats and now we can leave plates of food around her and she has no interest in it. Otis on the other hand would drive you crazy anytime you had food, and would take things off counters, tables...  Play with his feet and get him used to getting his nails cut.   Take him to pet store/park and let other people feed treats for recognizing his name or sitting and being calm.   Bassets rule."

When he had two herniated discs in his back, insurance refused to pay as it was classified as a ""genetic issue"".  After shelling out $5000 for the surgery to fix his back we cancelled our insurance and opted to put the money we used to spend on it in a savings account because we could guarantee there would be some money there when we needed it.  I'd advise to either put some money aside each month in savings or make sure you get a really good plan that covers everything."

basset,38h2ne,corpunk,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:32:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you would be interested in this, but I got my basset through the Dumb Friends League. I asked to be put on the purebred list for a basset and maybe a couple of weeks later I got my sweet 6-month old boy.  He was fixed as a condition of taking him home, which may not work for you if you are someday looking to breed yours.  It was much, much less expensive than going through a breeder.  He's not papered, but he's definitely not a mix.  I can't imagine who would give up my pup because he is so smart and sweet tempered (and was potty trained to boot!), but their loss.  High Country Basset Rescue is another good resource if you are looking to adopt.

basset,38e6y5,WyattShale,2,Wed Jun 3 17:04:27 2015 UTC,"This one might be up for some debate, but bassets are probably one of the better breeds to be left alone. They sleep a LOT, and seem to enjoy quiet time on their own. I did not have good luck with crate training, though. He hated it from day one and never got used to it. So that could be a problem in your plan. Obviously this varies from dog to dog. Every cared-for basset that I've met has loved all people and dogs, so be sure to take him out for walks and to dog parks or to meet friends' dogs. Yes they're stubborn. My first two refused to do any sort of obedience. My most recent hound actually took to it very well, and would do sit, down, stay, roll over, shake and occasionally come. Performance was improved on all of these with treats involved. Not sure how the heat and humidity of Louisiana would be, but I'm in Southern California, and my hounds have always sought out the sunniest spots and basked in them all day long. They howl a lot, especially when you leave the house. Some of it improves with age, but the howling and whining is one thing we never had a lot of success with curbing. We just tried to be considerate and bring them inside as soon as the howling started. The whining in the car drove us nuts. A lot of variables here. I think the ""old dog/new tricks"" thing has been largely disproven though. Maybe someone else can chime in here. I've had two die pretty young from cancer. Not sure if there is a way to screen this. For the most part you can't find a sweeter, more mild-mannered dog. We got our most recent basset as a puppy and he was six years old the first time kids started coming around, and he was incredibly gentle with them. A rescue dog is a bit of a gamble in this department. We recently visited the Basset Rescue Network in California and a large number of their dogs are marked as not kid-friendly."
basset,38e6y5,YouOverRotated,5,Wed Jun 3 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"I have a basset and it's just me and him. Sometimes me comes to work with me. When he doesn't,  he seems content to be home alone.  He loves when I come home and loves people but he's pretty content to be alone. One thing I would say is make sure any food/garbage/good smelling stuff is well out of reach and locked up.  They're inventive when they want to get at something. I can out run my dog and I'm not a runner. So an apartment is enough room for them.  Treat training worked for me. He also feels really bad when he's done something wrong.  But treats seem to be the only thing he will respond to.  They can be stubborn and I find I have to almost yell at him to get his attention at times.  We've been working in clap training right now.  They seem to be ok,  but I wouldn't take them for long walks in the middle of summer.  Mine never and still doesn't howl, unless I get him going.  I think like training any dog to not bark would work.  Mine was crated a lot when he was young.  He only barks/howls when someone is at the door.  They can be a bit difficult to train when they're older,  however,  I find older bassets are a lot more slow and lazy.  I know bowed backs are a big issues as are ear and eye issues. I can't answer this one."
basset,38e6y5,Deetoria,3,Wed Jun 3 21:58:25 2015 UTC,"Our Bassets were not / are not good candidates for being left alone for an extended amount of time.  They are bred to be stubborn rabbit chasers, and left to their own devices will make their own entertainment, which would probably entail the destruction of your apartment.  Our current dogs were crate trained from the beginning and it has made our lives and theirs much better.  They love (crave) routine and are really put off if they don't get their noon nap.  If you take them out on regular walks (again, routine) several (at least 4, morning, noon, eve, and before bed) times a day a small apartment is fine.  Socializing needs to start as soon as you get your dog, as it has to know it is part of a larger pack.  Frequent visits to other people, other dogs, is very important. Yes, they are stubborn.  Potty training was always difficult with our Bassets, but we've learned the best way is to determine their eat-to-poop time and plan your walks accordingly.  When in doubt, take them out.  Reward them (with either a treat or a ""good boy/girl"" praise) each time they do it right.  When they get it wrong, don't punish (they have no clue why you're upset), just take them out immediately. Bassets suffer more in heat with their excess skin and folds.  Avoid long term exposure to heat.  Regular (monthly or every other month) visits to a good groomer helps keep the fur in their folds clean, otherwise they develop waxy deposits that smell. They love to howl.  They will howl when they're happy, they will howl when they're lonely.  Sometimes they will bark continuously until they go hoarse.  Some have successfully used bark collars that beep loudly when they bark, but others just got ""bark-beep, bark-beep, bark-beep"". Rescue is a great way to go.  You can work with the shelter to take the dog on a ""probationary"" time to see if you fit into its lifestyle.  Yes I said that right. Best to do searches for Basset breeders in your area, look at their web sites, and call or email them to plan visits to talk with them about the breed.  Don’t be in a rush to bring one home, check them out first.  Often they will be planning a litter or know of another breeder who is, and if you like the traits of the parents and you're patient, you might find the exact traits you're looking for.  A good breeder will be interviewing you, not the other way around.  We waited over 9 months after finding a breeder and a pair we liked for our Bassets and it was well worth it.  They are subject to back problems and bloat, a proper diet (no people food!) and exercise is important to keep their weight down to avoid back issues and digestive problems. As with any dog, if you socialize them well, be the kind but firm pack leader, they'll accept additions to the pack.  But never trust any dog around kids unattended."
basset,38e6y5,corpunk,3,Wed Jun 3 17:48:49 2015 UTC,"some of my comments may be redundant as well. ONE: I got a basset 10 years ago and it was just me and him. Best decision ever. I have a schedule that changes as I am a grad student but have had a few jobs and more difficult semesters where I am gone longer. I found a great doggy-daycare in my area where he goes twice a week. He knows what those days are for some reason. They post pictures on Facebook of him sleeping on his back in the sun however he comes home exhausted and is less needy the next day. I divide up the week that way when I need to spend long days working out of the house. I have found that the day after daycare, he is recovering from having to hold his large head up (or something to that effect) and is more content hanging out at home. I will stop by if it is going to be a long day however splitting up the week with daycare makes me feel ok leaving him alone 8 hours for a few days a week. I will usually take him to the park on Sundays. I also take him on short walks in the evening when it is cooler.    This for me was a great way to socialize him. I think by nature, bassets socialize well. I have seen a few that don't however for the most part, I think you will be ok. I don't think you have to take extra steps to socialize one. Trips to the dog park, regular walks, etc. I didn't send my dog to daycare until he was close to 9months.   But, if you think about taking a basset puppy or any basset out in public, they get SO MUCH attention. Take it to get your mail, to go get coffee, etc. Socialization takes movement on your part but with a basset, it kind of flocks to you. They also know that they get attention and will totally work it.   As far as an apartment, I think they are excellent apartment dogs. I live in a condo. He has an area outside that he can be tied out. He likes to sit out and watch the world go by and howl at people. Everyone in the neighborhood knows them and he really only howls when they start walking away. Usually every night he will have a burst of playtime that lasts 5-10 minutes. He will flop around and tap dance and run in circles and play with toys. That seems to wipe him  out for the evening.  He is also 10, almost 11, so he doesn't have as much energy as he used to.    I was at home a lot when I first got him because he was a TOTAL RASCAL. He hated the kennel and I think it was the kennel that taught him not to cave in to food treats if he doesn't want to do something. That is when his stubborn streak started to show. I could throw a piece of meat or a french fry in there, let alone a dog biscuit and no matter how tempting it was, if he didn't want to do something, he would pretend the food wasn't there.  Perfect lead in for #2  TWO: I think he stubborn part is hilarious and defines his character a bit. He barely made it out of obedience class.  However, he is not a high energy dog and doesn't really misbehave in horrible ways. His stubbornness is pretending he is deaf when you want him to do something (usually come when called) and he doesn't want to. This is usually because he is laying down comfortable somewhere. He will also pretend he is sleeping when I'm in a rush and trying to take him outside. I think he knows when I'm serious because when I did have to harass him about jumping up on people and he is usually doesn't. If he starts, and I say something, he will listen.  He weirdly responds to me saying, ""don't even think about it.""    I swear that they will do the opposite in most times of what you want them to do. I am convinced he knows what he is doing and does this on purpose. None of the stubborn traits are antisocial. They are just him sort of being indifferent to what your agenda is.   So, stubborn yes, I would also like to add sneaky and manipulative. They will figure out how to get into things. There is a classic sound of my basset's huge feet on the counter as soon as I walk out of the kitchen because he knows he isn't supposed to do it. I've caught him standing still in the kitchen before, like a statue, only to find a pork chop bone in his mouth. He is stubborn and a little stinker but I have never met dogs like basset hounds. The stubbornness is part of what makes them hilarious. They really have a sense of humor.  I tried to crate train him but that only worked for about 2 months. I did the bell on the door thing and I just was home a lot and took him out all the time. I rewarded him for going. What he would then try to do would be to ring the bell to go out, go out of the door, turn right around and come back inside and stand by the cookie jar. (There's that sneaky manipulative piece.) I didn't find him hard to potty train despite him abandoning the kennel and juking the reward system.    THREE: My dog loves laying out in the sun, and then moving to the shade.. and back and forth. I don't take him out for walks, on asphalt and pavement on hot days in the middle of the day. I had a few bad experiences where I could see him struggling during a walk and once I even carried him home. I think warm/hot weather is ok, but hot weather plus blazing sun creates a molten lava zone that close to the ground. During hot times, I take him out at dusk and in the evening (like to take the trash out which is about 100 yards away but he finds it exhilarating.)  FOUR: He is a situational howler. He howls when he gets excited, when he gets home from daycare and greets a roommate or someone that is over. Or, when people walk by outside and stop and say hi to him and then start walking away. He will sometimes howl if people come over that don't come over often. He will sometimes howl when he sees stuff at the window. And, will sometimes do it at the cat. I do remember when I first got him that he would howl when I would leave. He does whine. He whines when he wants something. He can be pretty consistent. It's a very quiet yet irritating sound. He will just stare at me and do it.   I will say that they are great communicators. He knows how to tell me what he wants. He has different barks for different things.   FIVE: I don't know about this. I feel like if my dog learns anything new at this point in his life, it will be something he teaches himself. With that said, and maybe others might chime in about this, I don't feel like his stubbornness is bad behavior or harmful. I guess I have friends with labs that will do anything you want at the snap of a finger. I guess that would be obedience. My dog will just pretend he is sleeping. Or sit and look at me when I'm asking him to go outside and flop over on his side and sigh.   SIX: my dog turned out just like his dad which was awesome. his dad was spunky but really laid back. I would look for disposition from them. Bassets for the most part are laid back. If they seem anxious and uppity, that might be a warning sign. There are some back and hip issues. My breeder had X-rays of the parents with a doctor certifying the parents didn't have things like hip dysplasia. I lucked out with my breeder. They were a family that did it on the side every few years. They had three bassets.   I had a friend with a basset who had problems with his front legs. this was pretty apparent as they just never looked quite right, even as a puppy. As bassets have some pretty exaggerated features, I do feel like these can be spotted if you get familiar with bassets. However, I might just feel like that because I watch basset videos and look at basset pictures all the time.  SEVEN: My dog is so cool with you doing anything to him. He is great with kids. He will interact with them and if they get annoying, he will just lay there and fall asleep to make it go away. He has nibbled food out of baby's hands however he is extremely gentle when he does it :). I feel like bassets are very in tune with their human owners. I would like to have kids in the next few years and my dear first child (that would be my dog) I could imagine being a bit jealous because he has been #1 for so long however I feel like he would fit in rather well. He would just insert himself into the picture without being aggressive. Make more room for me on the couch! Also, he would be much too lazy to make a huge deal out of this. As long as he is in the vicinity he is good most of the time. When he is feeling needy, he just likes to have part of his body touching a part of a human body."
basset,38e6y5,chiaratara,2,Thu Jun 4 02:56:07 2015 UTC,"On your part about stubbornness and mischief, mine is like that two. Mine is a year and a half old but he is just like my 3 year old son. Most of the time they both work together."
basset,38e6y5,tommynohawk,2,Thu Jun 4 04:10:46 2015 UTC,"We got our basset as a pup and crate trained her from the beginning. My wife went home most days for lunch and was able to let her out. Our pup is now almost 2, and doesn't get let out too often during lunch, but she does just fine. She willingly goes to her kennel every morning when we are going to work, and every night when its bed time.  As a puppy they will be outside A LOT for potty training purposes. Ours loves to just hang out outside and lay in the grass. We take her for a walk most evenings, but if we don't get a walk she is content to nap on the couch or play a few rounds of fetch in the house.  Our basset wasn't super socialize...she knew our neighbors and my family plus a couple of my sisters dogs, but she loves everyone and everything. I think bassets are generally SUPER friendly. Treat training worked great for us. Thats how she learning potty-training, to go to her kennel, sit/lay (she doesn't know the difference), and stay. Just be consistent...they don't respond well to punishment, but love rewards. I live in the middle of Iowa, which gets hot and humid in the summer...not sure how it compares to Louisiana. Ours handles it fine. She gets tired quickly when active in the heat, but she likes to just lay in the sun. I think howling varies dog to dog. Ours doesn't howl a whole lot. She whines and grumbles at us, but only howls occasionally. Can't help much with this Most websites will tell you what issues bassets are prone to. We got ours from a breeder and ended up with a pup that has pollen allergies. Other than that shes great. The main thing is to go to a reputable breeder. My wife and I will be starting a family soon, so our choice of a basset took this into account. They are known for being super laid back and tolerant dogs. They love everyone! The older they get, the more chill they get, so you shouldn't have any issues in that respect.   Hope this helps!"
basset,38e6y5,PoopySnuggles,2,Wed Jun 3 19:37:34 2015 UTC,"Responding with my personal experience as a basset owner. Some if this may be a repeat from other replies.   So I raised my basset pup in an apartment. I, however, will admit I made the major mistake of not socializing her enough outside myself, my partner and some close friends when she was young. She's 5 now, and is pretty neurotic when outside of our apartment. When I take her on walks she is terrified of loud noises, and hides behind me when most strangers walk up to her. I still say bassets are great apartment dogs since they are low-energy, BUT you should go out of your way to take her/him on walks everyday, and to ask others to pet and hold her/him while young. Also, if you're gone from 8-5, you should consider going home to let the pup out at lunch breaks, or hiring someone to do so. That's a long time for pups to hold their bladder. In my experience, treat-training works for bassets almost as well as any other breed. However, outside of an obvious reward system, they have a habit of ignoring you when you give them a command. I mostly have issues getting her to come to me in the park when there are so many smells much more interesting than I am :P I live in Alabama, so similar heat troubles here :) So, bassets are close to the ground obviously, and are absorbing a lot more heat than you are when outside. I wouldn't recommend taking them on longer than half-hour walks during the summer, and avoid paved areas when doing so as well. If I want to be out longer, I usually take her to my local hiking trail, where there is a ton of shade and creeks for her to wade in. So, my answer here is going to be a bit different from others. Because I raised my basset in an apartment, I discouraged her from howling outside of play time. It's really not an issue; she doesn't even bark when someone comes to the door. I think the only real issue with getting an older dog is that if you live in a place where howling is an issue, you may not be able to train a dog that loves howling to be quiet. I imagine that the rescue will have information on the dog's behavior, so you can ask them about that.  Can't speak much here, but I do know that bassets are prone to back/hip problems. Might be something to watch out for. Bassets really are great dogs for kids. They're very gentle and non-aggressive (although possibly prone to knocking a young child over, as they underestimate their own size :P). Even my pup, who is pretty suspicious of strangers, would never bite a child. I don't have children, but we did get a rescue kitten about a year ago, and she did really well with the transition. As someone has mentioned here, though, it's something to watch out for if you plan on rescuing."
basset,38e6y5,itsanerika,2,Wed Jun 3 21:03:34 2015 UTC,1) they like to sleep and can be left alone. Ours was cage trained and would go right in whenever we left. Even when you get home they'll probably still sleep alot.   2) bassets are very stubborn but not totally untrainable.  Put a little bell on the door you let the dog out to go to the bathroom.  Ring the bell every time you let the dog out. Within a couple weeks your dog will be ringing the bell to let you know it wants out. This has worked with every dog I've ever had.  3) heat shouldnt be too bad. They'll just need plenty of water and some shade to lounge in.  4) I've had two bassets over the years and neither one was a howler or much of a barker for that matter. 5) no experience in this had both hounds since they were pups 6) look for reputation in the breeder and maybe the lineage of the dogs 7) not sure how they would react to children. My first  basset could've cared less when we had kids.  The second one put up with less shit the older he got. He would growl at the kids but never bite if they got too in his face when he didn't want them near  All in all they're stubborn but very laid back. They will catch a scent and follow it so make sure you have a fenced yard or a way to keep them contained. Also they may not look it but they are very capable of reaching up to your counter and snagging food when you're not looking
basset,38e6y5,badge13,2,Thu Jun 4 00:14:06 2015 UTC,"We did the bell training with our basset and soon realized that the dog was ringing the bell every time she wanted to smell or investigate something outside.  It didn't just mean ""potty,"" it was a means to get outside.  Clever little thing.  Who said bassets weren't smart?  We thought it was hilarious."
basset,38e6y5,laurshel,2,Thu Jun 4 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I live with a basset in an apartment. We adopted him from a family that didn't have time for him, so I can't help much with training tips (we didn't raise him) other than to say that my dog is food motivated - almost exclusively so. He is very high energy, we call him a defective basset... Do not count on your basset being lazy, not absolutely all of them are.  He hates being alone at home as he is very social - but he got used to it and he never destroyed much. He's usually never alone more than five hours, me and the husband work different schedules. He can stay alone for a little longer if needed.  When we moved to our new condo he didn't take it well and started howling in our absence (he was very confused); because the neighbors were complaining and we were at risk of having him expelled from the building (since this isn't a rental we can't just move somewhere else), we bought him a citronella spray collar. It took him literally three bark attempts to never howl indoors again - he's very sensitive to smells. We encourage him to bark and howl when we play outside, which he does daily. Some might not agree with that kind of method, but we weren't risking losing the dog - he's already been through enough and we want him to have a forever home with us. The complaining neighbor now actually likes him.  We give him at least two hours worth of walks a day and that is not enough for this fellow. He's 2 and a half years old now, we're hoping that he will slow down with time. Lots of energy, and he wants nearly constant attention - he has some anxiety issues, but that seems to be fairly common with rescue dogs, I don't know if it's a basset thing.  Kids wise, in his previous home he had two toddlers running around him all day long, he loved it. They also had a cat, and he seems to like them... Tried to lick one at a vet visit, but the cat wasn't impressed. He will not defend himself from anything, kids can poke him, little dogs try to bite him... He does nothing, just keeps on trying to smell more things. I've never heard my dog growl, I've had him for a year now... Not even when we play fight.  In summary, in my experience: these are very loving dogs who will crave your attention, so make sure that you have time to spend with the dog. My dog is very sweet and very demanding at the same time, in a ""he drives me crazy but I love him"" kind of way :)"

basset,38e6y5,onesonesones,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:35:42 2015 UTC,"1 - When Hubs and I got our first dog, we worked 10 hour shifts 4 days a week.  We were fortunate enough to have a family member come walk him at lunches.  He lived with us in a 1 bedroom apartment for 2.5 years.  We would spend a total (Broken up over the day) of an hour to an hour and a half walking him.  We encouraged him to play with other dogs/people while we were on these walks (large parks with lots of people are best) 2 - Crate training is what we used to get Tiberius housebroken.  As for general obedience he went to a treat-training method ""puppy class"" which was great for socialization, but I have had more success with a more dominant style of training, using martingale dog collars. 3 - In my part of Canada we see 100'f + temps in the worst of summer and sub 0'f temps in the winter.  We shorten the dogs walks accordingly.  Read up on heat stress for Dogs but he should be fine (Definitely don't get a Husky or other arctic dog). 4 - We were lucky with Tiberius that he wasn't too bad for howling, but it was something we trained with him on.  So it can be worked on, but will take training. 5 - I'm still training Tiberius today (At Age 9) it takes longer, but they can still be trained. 6 - Basset's tend to be a hardy breed but apparently Tiberius is not so much so.  He had 2 herniated discs in his back at age 5 which required $5000 surgery (At the Vet College, I've heard it costing up to twice that much) and Glaucoma (Now he is a one-eyed pirate dog!  But he's just like himself even with only one eye).  These are the issues we have run into.  Our second basset is only 2.5 years old now, and hasn't shown any signs of issue yet.  Do your reading on the breed and ask about any conditions the breeder knows other puppies from the same parents have had. 7 - We had Twin boys last year.  Even 9 year old, one-eyed Tiberius likes to play with and ""Kiss"" the boys, even though he doesn't play with them very often.  It is important to never leave babies/kids unsupervised with an animal.  But both dogs adjusted to the twins just fine.  If you want to see for yourself, here is a clip of our youngest dog playing with the boys at 7 months https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ6kL37XtEs&feature=gp-n-y&google_comment_id=z13ue1lrunikfbsja04cgdwxnpizgdubjsw0k  Hope this helps!  They are a wonderful breed, but like all dogs require lots of walks, training and love so think hard before you get one, but I couldn't imagine my life without my dogs!"

basset,38bamn,approx_volume,3,Wed Jun 3 13:01:18 2015 UTC,I see your beautiful dogs on this sub every day and they are just the sweetest pair. Puts a smile on my face every time I see them  ^_^  Thanks for the pic's! Keep em commin' :D
basset,38bamn,fdisk2053,2,Wed Jun 3 15:34:22 2015 UTC,Looks to me that Fred and Wilma want to talk to you about your browsing habits.
basset,38bamn,mtbrgeek,2,Wed Jun 3 10:58:14 2015 UTC,lol how many beds do they have?
basset,38bamn,clonetek,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"Many.  There's the one on the floor, the two Bassa-hammock's outside, the trampoline, and of course every couch and comfy chair in the house!"

basset,38afts,PotatoCamera,2,Tue Jun 2 22:58:42 2015 UTC,He like's lettuce? That's adorable!
basset,385hs7,goddamnMuslimAtheist,3,Tue Jun 2 00:13:39 2015 UTC,All bassets are lap hounds!
basset,385hs7,Desembler,2,Tue Jun 2 05:18:43 2015 UTC,Mine isn't. :(
basset,385hs7,mtbrgeek,2,Tue Jun 2 10:56:17 2015 UTC,Awww but Daisey is just well behaved on that front.  My Winston will push his way onto your lap without being invited and is such a lump that he refuses to move!  I'm such a poor trainer that I've allowed the habit to become ingrained!
basset,385hs7,Icepop131,2,Tue Jun 2 11:51:01 2015 UTC,I see both sides.. but Daisey isnt a cuddler...

basset,385hs7,bored_sith,2,Tue Jun 2 00:38:55 2015 UTC,That is unbearably cute.
basset,385hs7,Igarcia6286,2,Tue Jun 2 04:40:22 2015 UTC,having 2 bassets... they will push each other off the couch trying to be THE lap dog (especially if there is a blanket involved)... luckily the wife and i can usually have 1 each (if there is room on the couch for us)
basset,37mx1z,one8sevenn,3,Thu May 28 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I've never heard of bassets going on extended runs. I believe that when originally used for hunting, part of the allure was that humans could follow on foot at a (potentially brisk) walking pace. A two mile run at 10-15 mph might be too much.   On the other hand, my guess is that she would let you know if she was getting over worked.    Hopefully someone more knowledgeable can chime in...  In any case, cute pooch! I like the nerdy name :-)"

basset,37mx1z,NurseAngela,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:25:10 2015 UTC,Keeping the weight down is key! Bassets are full of energy they love long runs and walks!  She's Still a puppy at long as she gets a solid nap after a long walk she'll be fine!    She's might eventually slow down (at around 9 or so)  but generally speaking that much walking is great for her!
basset,37mx1z,itsanerika,2,Wed Jun 3 11:28:23 2015 UTC,Full of energy is right.   Sometimes I think she has more energy than my wirehair pointer who is more of a couch potato outside of these off leash adventures.  Thanks for the comment
basset,37mx1z,Ninjacherry,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:22:00 2015 UTC,I think the hiking would only be great for her but the running at higher speeds seems a bit much to me... they just aren't built to be runners. Seems a little too high-impact for their back/hips. But I'm no vet - should probably ask a vet about this issue next time you see one.
basset,37mx1z,jessicatron,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:32:39 2015 UTC,Will do.   Thanks
