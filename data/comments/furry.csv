furry,3e319i,stonerhippiemutt,4,Tue Jul 21 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"You're not obligated to reveal any personal information about yourself. The Internet used to be a lot more anonymous before the advent of Facebook and other social media. I kinda wish we had those days back tbh, I like the idea of everybody being equals, and not having to attach a face to an idea to make it somehow more valid. That said, it is a little bit disingenuous to lie about your age and say you're older than you actually are, so in the future just tell people who ask you that you're not comfortable saying! If theyou pester you about it anyways then you'll know they're probably not somebody worth talking to :3"

I doubt many - if any - of us are bothered, we only would be if you acted obnoxiously; if you're mature enough then your age doesn't matter. Chin up, chum!"
furry,3e319i,Grifsnacks,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"Age has nothing to do with anything, people just assume that immature accounts are owned by children or young teens because most people experience that that age group is the most immature.

Why do we need to share personal details with strangers on the internet. And by the power of greyskull I'm getting tired of seeing these kinds of posts on reddit, it isn't meaningful content, most of the subreddit probably doesn't give a crap about whatever personal thing someone is posting, it isn't a question or asking for help and its meaningless to apologise for something when people don't even know who is doing the damn apology."

Total of 5 years, the fastest you can graduate that program without extensive summer school/overloaded semesters  -college is really great, it changes your mentality on people. As a general group, college students are more mature and more accepting, plus you run into a lot of people who have just escaped high school peer pressure and are free to do what they want  -I didn't like my community college. I was just there for school so I didn't really meet people, nor did I care to. Moving to university, I was out of my home town, but also in a major with like minded people, something I really didn't appreciate until I left. There's something great about finding a group of friends in college, it's far better than high school ever was for me.  -I was an animation major (regretting that because I really should have done illustration). It was great, lot of all nighters though. After a while, college students try one upping each other with how long they've been awake studying, never underestimate how long art students will go without sleep."
furry,3e351k,Sareii,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:31 2015 UTC,Oh wow I went there as well. My fiance was an art major for a while before she changed majors. I still remember visiting her in the 3D design class. Damn that class was a struggle and I didn't even take that course.

But damn my fiance took it there at Fullerton. The class was full of students in the beginning with like 35-ish students. Only 10 or so still remained at the end of the semester. She told me one dude fainted at one point and had to call the emergency peeps since he didn't come-to soon enough.

The professors do research with undergrads. The 3D printers, CNC machines, robots, et cetera are all for undergrads. I've done research with three different professors so far, starting the summer after freshman year.  4.) Computer Science major, Religious Studies minor.

Love is a strong word; I just went to the place that has the best criminal justice program.   Criminal Justice, Generalist, with a forensic science minor."
furry,3e351k,FloppyToast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:22 2015 UTC,"Cal State Fullerton for 3 years. Then transferred to Riverside City College because I changed majors. Most people were impressed about me attending CSUF. I liked CSUF more than RCC because I had more of a chance to get into classes there than here at my not so great community college. The commute over there was interesting because for two years, I took the train. Then I decided to drive my last year. The campus had a better feel to it over there. Not to mention I could skate to class a lot easier than my community college so I had more fun that way. I also worked at the Carl's Jr. on campus and that was kind of like working in hell upon classes ending. Plus my fiance graduated this year from CSUF as well so that made it more special for me.  Well first it was Computer Science. I love computers, but not that much so I decided to change majors after not doing so well in programming and calculus. Now I'm at community college for Automotive Technology and am having a lot more fun for that but there's barely room for students."
furry,3e351k,Starcofski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"Cal poly pomona, but I won't be there much longer (finally). You ask like I try to call attention to it.  Pretty much nobody knows, only a handful of my closest friends even figured it out.  But it's more of a non-topic than anything.  Anything I say that could be tied to being a fur is meet with giggles and rolled eyes. I don't, but I didn't have a choice on where to go.  The college itself is a mixed bag, with some good and some bad professors, heavily commuter so weekends are pretty dead. Mechanical engineering with a computer science minor.   Good luck on your search!"

furry,3e351k,Fenrir74,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"Another alumni post, I always found it fun to help out prospective college students :)   Went to UC Davis for 4 years Honestly, college is what you make of it. One big thing is self control though, as there is seriously no one to guide you or force you to do anything. No one really cares if you go to class, do the labs, assignment, etc. Honestly for me it's was a really good learning experience of scheduling and juggling social life with academics on your own. Also, remember all those High School statuses, dramas, or cliques? Yeah, in my experience, that's all gone; you're on your own and one of the biggest revelations I got from college was to just be yourself. Who's to judge you for your sense of style or quirks? Just take it easy and come to terms that no one gives a shit about you (it sounds horrible, but it's liberating in a way). It's easy to make friends, escpecially if you live in the dorms, but true friends that most likely will stay with you are the ones in your same major as you'll see them for the whole 4 years.  Also, GO TO CLASS. You have to remember although you don't have to go, you've already paid for it so it's your loss if you don't go and learn. If you're talking about people knowing I'm a furry, only my close friends do. They don't give a shit and they just put up with my shenanigans. It's Davis. Cow country. I never liked urban areas, and coming from a suburban hometown, it's a nice refreshing change of lifestyle to be out in a rural college town. Went in as Nutrition Major since I wanted to do something ""medical"" related, but quickly realized the major was full of hipsters and vegans who judge intensly whenever you eat meat or anything they deem ""unhealthy."" I then realized I was more interested in the food aspect rather than the bio-med side and so I switched to Food Science!"

Or if you can find someone who can do it for you, consider having it done in an ambiguous, minimal style.   You might get asked about it, which is when you tell them it's a design you liked, and ask why they're curious - if you can read cues about people, you will know who's a furry, who's not a furry, and who hates furries. You then have a way to say that yeah and this is your fursona, or still have a way to back out and deny that if you feel like it."

furry,3dziv2,NefasDesidia,2,Tue Jul 21 12:14:58 2015 UTC,"I used to work at a theme park. Being in a hot,  tropical country,  being in a fursuit (or any fully covered costume for that matter) is really a death trap. Heat exhaustion can come in very,  very quickly (got it once,  not fun at all). The people in the suits are at the most in them for 20 minutes."

furry,3dziv2,DarthSlatis,2,Tue Jul 21 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"There should be a rule in the fandom that you don't get to wear the suit until you have spend a certain number of years as a ""squire.""  I have no idea why, I just love the image and the ridiculous idea that the fursuit is a great achievement of nobility and honor."
furry,3dziv2,epochwolf,5,Tue Jul 21 00:34:10 2015 UTC,"I would think suiting would be the training period, and being a handler would be the honer. You don't really know what your charge is feeling and needs until you've been there."
furry,3dziv2,icepaws,2,Tue Jul 21 01:01:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that would help. You really do need to practice being in a fursuit. When you get overheated, your brain partially shuts down. If you haven't been in that situation before, you can end up doing some really freaking dumb stuff.  After one fursuiting session, I jumped in the deep end of a very cold pool at night while in the middle of heat exhaustion. I immediately started going into shock while in 8 feet of water. No one knew I was in the pool. The lights were off, so no one could see me. I managed to get to the ladder before I completely lost control of my arms and legs. I nearly died that night.  Since then, I've been prepared for overheating. If I get overheated, I take off my head, unzip the bodysuit and drink water slowly until my brain works again.   The problem is no amount of advice can really help with this. Until you're overheated you can't know what you are going to do. All plans go out the window and you're confused. Unless you can recognize what's wrong and do what needs to be done, you're in trouble."

furry,3e0oz8,epochwolf,3,Tue Jul 21 01:41:49 2015 UTC,I got the rhino suit a little over a year and soon figured out that there was a mammoth suit that was made around the same time. The owner of the mammoth posted him for sale about a month and a half ago and had to reunite the characters.  They were made about 7 years ago and were reunited again about a month ago. Now they will be derping around together again.

furry,3e1wzz,SittingInYourBushes,7,Tue Jul 21 09:19:53 2015 UTC,"This may not answer your question, but I thinks it's when the defining traits don't have a direct similarity to what they were inspired by. Sergals are good example of this. Sergal heads may have been inspired by sharks or raptors, but they aren't quite the same. When I look at a (good) sergal, I don't see a shark head on a furry body. It looks like a completely original concept to me. I honestly think a shark looks more like a sergal than a sergal looks like a shark, if that makes any sense.  There's also the addition of defining traits that aren't apparently inherited by other species. Like the shoulder wings on a Renamon. No other species has something directly comparable to those shoulder wings, they are original. Most people wouldn't even consider them to be actual wings. Renamon's head is also another good example, in that it is more cone-shaped rather than having a distinct snout.  Basically, I think the key is making the additions or combinations look natural without being overly unique. You can of course take inspiration from one or more existing species, but to me the key is to not make it obvious where it came from and have the final product be distinct on its own."
furry,3e1wzz,GoldenDiamonds56,3,Tue Jul 21 09:32:32 2015 UTC,You said exactly what I wanted to say in a much clearer way than I could have.
furry,3e1wzz,leap89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:52:15 2015 UTC,"It depends on how far you mix things up. You can have ""its a bird with a cat head and scales"" or ""it has a slightly feline head shape, but with a longer snout and small beady eyes like a weasel. It has a lizard like tail, but covered in fur, but has the spines on its tail and back. It has wings, they're the shape of bats wings, but still has feathers on them."" Do you see the difference? It's just how much you mix the various species. You can't have a realistic species that can't be related by current animals."
furry,3e1wzz,QWyke,2,Tue Jul 21 09:37:16 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but everything you just described makes me immediately think of a hybrid rather than a new and original something."

furry,3e1wzz,QWyke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:54:00 2015 UTC,"I think it partially depends on how many species you are using features from. If 2-3, call it a hybrid. If more than that, it may be better to call it a new species."
