One of the good things 5e did was tone down dice pool bonuses so that it's no longer trivial to get dicepools of 30+.   The matrix has been cleaned up a bit so that you no longer make tons of extended tests, instead you make tons of opposed tests, so its marginally faster."

I did not even start reading those rules because with the time I have to make a character, I knew making a Decker or Rigger would have been terrible :)"
Shadowrun,3e4h9q,felicidefangfan,4,Tue Jul 21 22:28:22 2015 UTC,"For the most part limits don't interfere with play, what they do is stop you from dumping lots of attributes under the assumption you'll never need them (so its more of a buff to attributes). They were mainly introduced because they increased the rating you can get skills at (its now 1-12 instead of 1-6 like in 4e, consequently you can now get as many skills up to rating 6 at chargen as you like). The other area limits affect is equipment. A lot of equipment no longer provides a boost to your dicepool, it instead forms a limit (or alters it). Take the weapons for example, now there's another balancing effect in play in that some guns will be more accurate than others. Or that purpose built clubs will be more accurate (get more successes) than an improvised chair leg.  I would argue that the cyberware increasing costs reflects that you get more money at chargen in 5e than 4e (in 4e you could get up to 250k nuyen, whereas B priority in 5e gives 275k). You could also argue cyberware has been buffed, as it now enchances limits :P  Your example is interesting, wired reflexes is still significantly cheaper than than the synaptic booster, and the ganger you mentioned would still need twice as long to get the boosters. And thats assuming he doesn't get the wired reflexes at a used value   Used is a quality of cyberware (like standard, alphaware etc) - a 5e addition where the essence cost is increased by +1.25%, availability is decreased by -4, and the nuyen cost is decreased by * 0.75 (so the ware is cheaper but has higher essence cost like you wanted).   The recent 5e book chrome flesh (augmentation from 4e) added omega ware, the ware is cheaper and more available but doesn't cost more essence (essentially used ware without the essence cost increase), instead the ware has some kind of problem that the player and gm decide on   For example those wired reflexes might occasionally short out under heavy use (every 2nd turn after turning them on roll a d6, on a 1 the ware turns itself off), or perhaps they're stuck on leading to problems with twitchiness, or perhaps they only provide +1 to reaction, they don't add the extra d6 to initiative etc etc   The priority system lets you create a more specialized character, with a focus on getting important skills and attributes high at the cost of others. Karma gen exists because sometimes you want a very specific character (perhaps more rounded than the specialist) and it lets you create exactly the character you want, at the cost of not being able to easily get as many attributes/skills to as high a rating. Sum to 10 is arguably the best option, as you can lose an area of weakness in exchange for another area of strength (and vice versa), which is why its my favourite - get the specialist you want without them being really weak in other areas. I'm not sure what you meant by ""buying option X with priorities"" as all char gen processes are limited to availability 12, and all qualities still use karma regardless of your build system  The matrix is arguably the strongest part of 5e, now much more streamlined so that having the decker play takes place alongside everyone else instead of taking up all the time. Its wireless nature means they can do a lot more whilst the decker is also able to be present on the run. Cyberdecks are a thing again (which is good) and utilize those equipment limits mentioned earlier in the post"
Shadowrun,3e4h9q,Bamce,6,Tue Jul 21 23:13:53 2015 UTC,"Limits are basically useless. The only time I have seen it come into play is via sneaking and low physical limit.   Many people now call this ""magic run"" because of how non magic things have taken a hit. However You can still build effective cyber characters, It just takes some clever thinking.  The editing in 5th edition is horrible.   Run faster had details for the karmagen system. I rather like the priority based system. I keeps you from just making a team of ""generalists"" which is a complaint I have heard about from 4th edition."

Shadowrun,3e4h9q,LonePaladin,2,Tue Jul 21 22:22:46 2015 UTC,Only part I've seen win out via karma system is in skills. Mostly because of the group points. For example the stealth group for some characters the disguise aspect of it isn't nearly as important as the other ones. And being forced to level it via the stealth group. A few other things.
Shadowrun,3e4h9q,LC_HoTS,3,Tue Jul 21 22:32:59 2015 UTC,"so please try to sell me the game.   Eh. Either you like it or don't. Your call. It's just a game.   Either you roll below them and they do not matter at all, or you have to use edge to make a good roll a good roll.   Everything has a cost. It's a mechanic to link attributes to maximum skill ability. I kind of like it because it gives Edge an additional use - ""blowing out the Limit"".   Wired reflexes are the most glaring example of this. These used to be the cheap option that eats lots of essence, something a ganger might save up for a year to buy because it is somewhat affordable. Now they cost an arm and a leg, but eat the same essence as before. Anyone not stupid will just pay a bit extra now to have a synaptic accelerator and save between 1.5 and 3.5 essence.   5th Edition:  Wired Reflexes 3 cost: 5 Essence and 217,000¥, Avail 20R Synaptic Booster 3 cost: 1.5 Essence and 285,000¥, Avail 18R  4th Edition, Anniversary:  Wired Reflexes 3 cost: 5 Essence, 100,000¥, Avail 20R Synaptic Booster 3 cost: 1.5 Essence, 240,000¥, Avail 18R  So, Synaptic Booster 3 is still more expensive by 68,000¥ (opposed to 140,000¥ in SR4A). Additionally, Wired Reflexes can stack with a Reaction Enhancer for a total of +6 Reaction.  A hit of Kamikaze + Jazz will cost you 175¥ at 4R/2R (respectively) and a massive headache.  The increased cost for wired puts it more in-line with a professional's hardware. Gangers would likely have used cyberware anyway, so wired 1 or 2 at a discount. Seems alright to me.   Copy/paste rules:    Each edition is an iteration on the previous. A lot of the rules in 5th are like 4th, some are like 3rd, a few are like 2nd, and a small number are like 1st.   Creature stats also seem copy/pasted mostly, leading to the weird situation where they are balanced vs starting characters but entirely trivial to experienced ones with better stats.   Paranimals are meant usually in swarms or in addition to metahumans, not as solo-boss battles. This has always been true. A pack of 30+ Devil Rats swarming over a runner can lead to some serious weirdness - ""Okay, what page are the melee teamwork rules on? Oh, god, this is going to be a lot of rolling...""   This is also true of spirits,   Spirits have been getting toned down over the years, sadly.   Character creation: Why is there a priority system and why is it the default system to create characters?   Welcome back to the old world! 1st through 3rd were priority as the default, 4th went to build points, 5th is back to priority. The outlier is 4th. So the real question is why the default for 4th wasn't priority.   The priority system ignores exploding costs for high attributes and skills and leads to weird characters, where it is mathematically better to have high highs and low lows.   This is, to my understanding, somewhat by design. At least it has always appeared to be so. Shadowrunners are flawed in some way or for some reason. It's meant to make characters complimentary with some overlap rather than encouraging generalists who can do everything."
Shadowrun,3e4h9q,Bamce,3,Wed Jul 22 01:57:19 2015 UTC,"One of the benefits to the limit system is that some items now better reflect their actual effects.  Take, for instance, a laser sight. In 4E, it simply gave you an extra die, the same as every other beneficial item or effect. In 5E, it instead increases the gun's Accuracy by 1. It doesn't make you more skillful, but instead lets you take advantage of more of your existing skill."
Shadowrun,3e4h9q,floyd_underpants,2,Wed Jul 22 03:17:48 2015 UTC,"In regard to limits: Push the Limit on page 56 of the core rules outlines that by spending one point of edge you get to add your edge rating to the test, have exploding dice (on a six), and most importantly Ignore Limits. Edge does this (and many other things) so that you have a reason to take a higher priority of metatype at chargen even if you are playing a human, because when you don't have the physical abilities for the shadows you need luck on your side.   In regard to character creation: You need to remember that the point buy system wasn't created until months after the core rules, which seemed to be design more around missions play. Things get exponentially more expensive because ""the system is meant to represent the time it would take to develop a real skill"" and more likely to keep characters from getting super overpowered. What it seems like Catalyst had in mind was for runners to have broad and diverse skill sets, that the average character would be a jack of all trades, and that min-maxing would be the exception for people who were huge losers who didn't like fun were more fond of previous systems. As that clearly didn't work they tried to fix it in Run Faster by adding Point Buy (which was asked for because we all like the idea of creating more diverse characters, just not in the way they seem to want us to) in a really gimped way and the Life Modules to create more ""realistic"" scenarios. For the record I too find Point Buy disappointing and Life Modules awful, this is not a defense of their inclusion, but it does reflect how Catalyst tried to make Chargen about a team of Swiss army knives and maybe one combat monster or a mage for those icky combat bits.   As for the rest I don't have enough experience with any of the previous additions to comment."
Shadowrun,3e4h9q,felicidefangfan,3,Wed Jul 22 00:27:34 2015 UTC,"just a quick thing to add,   You can use this after you roll. You only get to explode the edge dice(which you add after the fact) but you keep all the hits total."

Shadowrun,3e4h9q,karmadestroying,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:48:40 2015 UTC,"As a guy who still needs a little selling on it myself, I am slowly making some peace with it.  It happened when I tried to re-write it.  As I was copying and pasting the text over to a word doc, and making some changes, I began to realize how it all worked together, and how it would be problematic to tinker with past a point.  In seeing this, though, I also saw the logic of most of it.  I ended up having to stop my process.  While at first I thought, ""screw limits"" I sort of get it now.  I've used them for Magic in 4e without a problem.  Matrix limits make sense in the same vein, however, since you can just use a free action to switch them every turn, they are meaningless in all practical senses.  You can fix that by making it a simple action at least to make the change.  Then players have to sacrifice something meaningful and make a tougher choice.  Edge being a way to extend limits is a no sale to me, since as I recall, you have to choose that idea before the roll, which defeats the spontaneous fun factor of ""wow what a roll"", which I always found players enjoy a lot.  Plus you have a limited number of uses of that.  This feels like hard coding the opportunities for fun, which I tend to dislike, even though I do like all the various uses for Edge. I think Physical Limits can be dispensed with most easily, but after that, the balance gets more easily disrupted, the game may play a way you didn't want it to.  Best to try it a few times and see what actually doesn't play the way you want it to, then adjust it with just a nudge, rather than a hammer.  I agree it's more clunk that SR needs, but it's what 5E needs to keep itself whole.  Where limits matter most is in combat.  The damage mechanics are very all or nothing, and since you can dodge bullets now, every extra success matters a lot.  Not my taste, but the goal appears to have been to punish combat monkeys who liked to wade through everything.  It's semi-preposterous to propose that any given weapon limits your ability be successful with it, but the system needs it to somehow mitigate the self-inflicted issue of the higher damage values.  The exercise of scaling back damages would be global to the game, and seems like it would be a lot of trial and error, so that's a big drawback to trying to play Mr Fix It.  Not something I have time for really.  The cyberware pricing doesn't bother me, really, same ideas and bonuses they have had for twenty years in most cases.  The prices have changed in every edition.  Keeping 4e price charts wouldn't be a problem, if you wanted to, as I see it.  That sort of thing is pretty trivial to adjust. If you need an excuse, just change the location and say ""that's what it costs in this area"".  Done.    The absurd wireless bonus concepts do bother me though, and the extent of the wireless world idea does too.  We live in a world now where just today, hackers took over a new jeep lock, stock and barrel.  You mean to tell me in 50 years time, we'll be so dumb we put objects in our bodies that can also be hacked?  Nonsense.  No minor bonus would get that past the giggle test.  I could buy that you would need to periodically update, but you have no way to measure wind shift effect on bullets if there's no device present that can do it.  Arguing that getting online can get you this data and that you can leverage it with software is just goofy to me.  I would have to rewrite a lot of those ideas too.  It also seems absurdly easy to at least brick if not hack any gear that's online.  I would make that harder too, I think.    Overall, the bad editing and unfortunate writing style makes it the hardest to access, and the poor presentation of the glut of rules (many of which are ancillary to the core system function) really are what I struggled with.  As I was trying to cull them out, I realized a couple things:   1) This is also the ""everything has a rule"" edition. If they mention a game world effect, they provide a rule for it.  While this could be seen as a benefit, I've spent a lot of time improvising SR at the table, so it just gets in my way mainly.  Sure, it may shut down/assist certain players that like to lobby for a bonus based on some passage in a book, but you don't need many of the rules to play.  Better distinction between these two classes of rules would have helped a lot.  Do that, and you'll have the rules you need.  2) The Quick Start rules are written much better than the core book.  I would start any group with the Quick Start rules, and only seek a specific ruling if something comes up that you need.  Designate a rules lawyer for your table, and let the interested player look it up while you keep the story moving.    Overall, there's still not enough appeal for me to buy any more books, but then again, I haven't played it yet either.  Things like full autofire are still broken, and now, area spells bounce, and the GM can nuke you and your deck from orbit if you irk them with online antics (which probably bothers me the most of all because it's encouraging a lazy/punitive GMing style, which I try to avoid).  But they did make some long overdue fixes to things like mana bolts, and gave a variety of ways to evade that high incoming damage.  Overall, it looks like an edition that would be very easy to find itself mired in very slow combat turns, if the GM was not experienced enough to hand wave some of the fiddliness.  I myself wanted the opposite: slick, fast rules that enable quick play.  Big metarules with specific ones that let you bypass or hack the main ones.  Get on with the story and stop dragging players through the quagmire of Rules City.  SR is too complicated for many players as is.  I suppose I partly feel that way because I also end up becoming the rule book in my groups, and players almost never buy the books.  I also know the concepts very well, and no player has so much power they can't be checked if that's my need.  Things don't need prices, they just need counters, and everything has had one for 5 editions now.  Steamroll all the biker gangs you like.  One was working for a megacorp and you are now a target for people with unlimited budgets.    Mostly, I wish the book had been oriented to allow us to play the game our way, and didn't enforce a specific playstyle and world feel on you as a GM or player through mechanics.  Let us decide how to play our game.  D&D 5E took that approach and they are making a hit with a diverse fanbase.  SR 5E is creating strife between the player base, and over some of the most fiddly nonsense trivia.  I've seen tons of arguments and math fights instead of substantive discussions about how to make things fun.  That's where I feel this edition missed the boat hardest.    If you don't like the vision and feel of the world they describe, the system isn't for you either, as it all ties together.  If you like the way they describe the world, try out the system too.      At least that's where I am at with it right now.  I'm sorta over most of my gripes.  Just had to say I think you should give it a try, it's got more to like than the first pass offers.  Who knows, I may be talking more with my arse.  I hope I am.  I love SR.  If I ever run across a game of it, I would play it to try it out."
Shadowrun,3e41o1,shomaxt,8,Tue Jul 21 20:07:12 2015 UTC,"Alright chummer listen up.  The question isn't ""what my character should be"" as ""who my character is"". Shadowrun is  marvelously flexible character generation system. It allows you the freedom to make just about anything.  So first, some homework  the Arcology podcast is a fantastic place to start. It gives you a nice walk through starting from episode 1 about what shadowrun is.  Then, if your crazy about podcasts like I am. Opti over at the Neo-anarchist podcast can give you a huge amount of lore/history information.  If you like you can send me a Pm with your skype info. I would be happy to help however I can with any shadowrun, or hub related questions."
Shadowrun,3e41o1,Bamce,4,Tue Jul 21 20:46:46 2015 UTC,"Playing a mage, shaman, decker, hacker or rigger may require knowing the rules a bit more than with other ""classic"" archetypes. If you are willing to dive into them, go for it. Otherwise, you may want to go for something a tad simpler, like an adept or a street samurai.  If you are a beginner et tabletop RPG and/or a bit shy, playing a face  might represent a small challenge in itself, since it generally involves a lot of talking. I am ot trying to discourage you, but it is worth keeping in mind.  Other than that, you could choose anything you are comfortable with, from the classics like medic, cat burglar, driver, sniper, ... to any exotic mix of your choosing. Do not feel limited to the base archetypes and do not hesitate to create a versatile character that will not be restricted to a single ""role"" in the team."
Shadowrun,3e41o1,MixedLoomDodger,2,Tue Jul 21 20:26:20 2015 UTC,"For my players who have experience with games that have power lists such as video games, I usually start them in Shadowrun as a sorcerer adept. The actual rules for cyberware, shooting bursts, recoil, armor penetration, accuracy, and the encyclopedic knowledge of the gear ends up making cyborgs quite esoteric for new players.   Whereas most of the time a new sorcerer essentially just selects a spell they think will be useful and select it's strength. They make a roll and they follow the process for drain. After trying it a few times the player starts to realize that there's a little bit of finesse to choosing the right force or selecting just the right spell. But it's not nearly as complicated as trying to understand when one wants to split their dice pool to attack multiple guys with their Ares Alpha whether they should do the BF-short, BF-long, FA-short, or FA-long."
Shadowrun,3e41o1,garner_adam,4,Wed Jul 22 02:08:37 2015 UTC,"Personally the thing I have found easiest is someone who is just about fighting. Pick one style of fighting, come up with a good background story, throw in all the cliche you can think of. And you will get a chummer that is great and easy to roleplay while you only need to learn a few basic rules.  Later you can transform you character, as you get more adept to the game so can he and learn new things and get new traits."
Shadowrun,3e41o1,HoverBaum,3,Tue Jul 21 21:15:13 2015 UTC,I'd recommending poking around on the r/hubchargen page to look at some builds. As a first time player id recommend street Sam or face. Matrix and magic are confusing for first time players. If you got anymore specific questions don't hesitate to ask!
Shadowrun,3e41o1,Paddywagon123,3,Tue Jul 21 20:28:01 2015 UTC,"If you decide to play a mage, adept or mystic adept you don't have to pick priority A for magic to get 6 magic.  A lot of new players don't realize your Metatype priority points can go to Edge or Magic.  For example, if you are making a human mage you can pick priority C Magic and priority D metatype, and use the 3 metatype points towards magic so you would start with Magic 6.  It gives you the option of using priority A & B on skills or attributes (which would generally be worth a lot more karma)."
Shadowrun,3e41o1,Mittensworth,2,Tue Jul 21 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"If you're playing a mage or a mystic adept however, you'll likely want that priority A for the number of spells you'll get (plus the headstart on the magical skills)."

Which you will probably be better off with attributes A, as the 4 extra attributes can make you way less squishy. And raising those attributes would cost you more than 15 karma.   You can get very far on 7 spells, you just need to chose spells wisely"
Shadowrun,3e41o1,Bamce,2,Tue Jul 21 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"Spells are only 5 karma each, but a single attribute point raising a stat from 4 to 5 is worth 25 karma.  I've always found its a lot easier to buy them with karma either at creation or after my first run or two.  The minimum priority C gives you five spells, which is usually enough to get started."
Shadowrun,3e41o1,Mittensworth,2,Wed Jul 22 00:20:44 2015 UTC,"I've always gone with skills being the priority displaced by magic, as attributes are too useful and the magical priority gives you most of the skill points you need to actually function as a mage (core ones being 6 in spellcasting, summoning and assessing, binding as high as you can get it but less important than the other 3)"

It's a pretty cool way of quickly generating a character and ending up with some skills you might not have bothered getting otherwise. I'd also recommend staying away from the Mystic Adept for your first character, just because the magic system can be a little overwhelming.

Figure out a character that you can connect with and start building, because the best way to learn is practice."
Shadowrun,3e41o1,LC_HoTS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:55:49 2015 UTC,What I suggest is that you make a Street Samurai. They are a very easy to play archetype and a lot of fun. Very nice for both new and old players and it makes the learning curve a lot smoother. What I also suggest is that you use the priority system to make your character. A good spread would be like this.  A: Resources B: Attributes C: Skills D: Race E: Magic  The only downside to this is your race options would be restricted. You could always tweak if needed.
Shadowrun,3e4mc9,felicidefangfan,4,Tue Jul 21 22:34:25 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much in agreement. I'm going to write up an HTR team after the rigger book comes out later this year.  I plan on two flavors of HTR team. A legal HTR team, representing the police force. And a Corporate HTR team, which can have all the forbidden gear they want.  The Corporate HTR team can only operate on extraterritorial property, since forbidden gear will be legal there.  The police have to make do with restricted gear."
Shadowrun,3e4mc9,dethstrobe,4,Wed Jul 22 00:45:13 2015 UTC,"Isn't forbidden gear just forbidden to civilians, any security/military gear being fully usable by security teams?"

Shadowrun,3e4mc9,dethstrobe,2,Wed Jul 22 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"I could see that argument. But I think it makes more sense that forbidden gear is just straight up forbidden. No one is allowed to have it.   Also, I like the idea of being able to flavor up Knight Errants HTR team and a Mega Corp HTR team to not be the exact same. It also means that if you are able to get off extraterritorial grounds, you won't be as screwed as when KE send their guys.  And to be fair, there is a lot of really good restricted gear. Not everything needs to be forbidden."
Shadowrun,3e4mc9,Tyrhaynes,3,Wed Jul 22 01:25:09 2015 UTC,That seems to me to be more along the lines of special forces like Army Rangers or Navy Seals or a generalist squad for the Red Samurai or other corporate team.  In my games elite deckers and mages aren't risked on the front lines unless it is a big deal.   Your mages and deckers are gonna be floaters usually providing long distance overwatch and joining teams as needed. If the first HTR team goes down and recon has the enemy's measure than with total overkill and measures to protect the key assets they will go out.
Shadowrun,3e4mc9,Tyrhaynes,3,Wed Jul 22 00:21:18 2015 UTC,"I always assumed HTR was on the level of red samurai and the like, whilst special forces were even tougher (all combat related attributes at augmented maximums, combat related skills at 10-12 for example)  I like the idea of a weaker first response team, with long range magical and matrix backup. Something like a squad car with just some above average cops? Ford americar/Hyundai Shin-Hyung for the car stats (first as a general squad car, second as a much faster car if high speed is needed), fullbody armor/light security armor with helmet and integrated gasmask (instead of chemical seal), smgs instead of assault rifles, a couple of flashbang/smoke grenades.  Do you give the first response team the times from the corebook? or is that the time for if that first team goes down?"
Shadowrun,3e4mc9,Zemalac,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:49:08 2015 UTC,Yeah the first high threat response team goes out which is your basic SWAT team. Depending on what happens with them other equivalent teams might be prepped or an elite team with or without mage/decker support. If I would think based on recon that specials might go along then I roll a die to represent the mage and the decker and an elite leader. If I get an hit they go. Kind of a short cut as if even they want them to go they might be busy with another issue and can't leave then.  Different corps I might handle differently. Novatech has more deckers so they wouldn't be as precious whole Wuxing would have more mages.
Shadowrun,3e4mc9,Thorbinator,3,Wed Jul 22 04:23:33 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much what I do, except that I have the P-Tac being run by the decker instead of the squad leader, and I usually include two or three guys as a designated breaching team. They're armed with shotguns and explosive rounds, and possibly a riot shield, and their job is to drop the door and get through it in about half a second, taking any return fire on the shield and throwing flashbangs. If the shield can be one of those flash-pack or stun shields, all the better."

Shadowrun,3e4mc9,CitizenJoseph,2,Tue Jul 21 23:06:56 2015 UTC,"I always assumed HTR would be a small set of highly specialised people, who don't get used very often. Most of the time that mage isn't putting their ass on the line - they're just sitting ready in whatever deployment station HTR use. And when they do go out they're relatively safe thanks to their excellent skills, equipment and training (and chances are HQ wants them behind the less valuable samurai, they only need line of sight to be effective after all).  I agree that you'd mainly want the mage to counter another mage, but wouldn't it give you a severe upper hand against a team of mundane criminals?  Edit: considering how a mage is an uncommon asset (just by being a mage) thats even rarer (strong magic/skill with spellcasting/summoning) I suspect there'd be a significant ""suggestion"" from their corp about how useful they'd be to an HTR team"
Shadowrun,3e5nkl,LonePaladin,2,Wed Jul 22 03:37:50 2015 UTC,"When you get cybernetic implants, they do wire them directly into your nervous system. That's how you think of moving your cyber arm, and it moves. But those connections don't have enough bandwidth to support the more complex data functions, like coordinating operation between Wired Reflexes and Reaction Enhancers. Once upon a time, people had to run wires all over their bodies in order to let devices talk to each other. But that becomes a hassle if you get sliced with a sword, or if someone knocks the gun from your hand and snaps the wire in the process. Which is why most people rely on WiFi these days.  If your GM is willing to stretch their imagination, some wireless bonuses can be permitted even if the run takes place inside a shielded complex. Ejecting the magazine on your gun doesn't require an internet connection, it just requires being able to send a signal to the device remotely. So that should work regardless. However, the bonus dice you receive from a Smartgun and Smartlink involve up-to-date weather data so the weapon can compensate for wind velocity and all that. For those things, you need access to Weather.com or whatever. But to do either remotely, your gun needs to have the basic wireless functions enabled.  If someone has Skinlink or a Data Cable running to their gun, then they would be able to eject the magazine and all that, no problem. It even says so in the book. But the rules are written from a somewhat generalized point of reference. What if the gun is lying on a table across the room? You disabled the wireless entirely, which means you can't communicate with the gun remotely. Never mind whether you needed weather or just basic control, it can't ""hear"" you."
Shadowrun,3e5nkl,marcus_gideon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:47:36 2015 UTC,"Generally I say smartguns still work even without their wireless connection.

If wind factor is a part of the calculations, then you're going to have a system that has a built in sensor for that, that will give you the right readings right then in real time rather then wait to download them when they are already a few milliseconds old(and not as reliable).  I'll also never be able to buy that good old fashion fiber optic cables inside of you are somehow slower and can carry less data then WiFi."

When you opened skills, the left side red/blue/green bars got out of wack and stopped working. Also tons of lost real estate.  Use cards for skills instead.

For 1, your in a  ""unnatural body""  For 2, the person you are possessing is actively, if futility resisting  for 3, the spirit is dual natured, and would be literally surrounding the negative emotions a live person would be giving off for the horrible experience they are going through. Which is some cases, could potentially trigger a background count spike."

That still seems like a massive disadvantage compared to other traditions as you need make possession rolls whenever you need a service and you arnt always going to have a prepared vessel which makes the roll somewhat difficult"

Care to extrapolate how possession is OP?"
Shadowrun,3e1yzj,marwynn,4,Tue Jul 21 21:51:01 2015 UTC,"Check out channeling on pg 148 of street grimoire   CHANNELING When a magician summons a spirit, she may choose to allow the spirit to possess her instead of allowing the spirit to exist in the astral plane to either manifest (p. 314, SR5) or materialize (p. 398, SR5). This must be decided at the time of summoning. Treat channeling the same as if the spirit has the Possession power (p. 197), with a few exceptions:    The magician can use her own skills and has motor control over her body. She may relinquish control of her body to the spirit, but at the cost of a service. The magician can use the powers of the spirit, but at the cost of a service. Because two minds inhabit this same body, Mana spells or powers are resisted by the lowest Mental attribute of the two. Damage from Mana spells or powers is applied to both (no free rides). The spirit cannot leave the magician’s body until either the services are up, the magician dismisses it, or time expires as per the rules of summoned spirits.   Then combine it with the rules from page 197  When the mage is channeling he gets the   living vessels * Reducing the wound modifiers by 1 die per point of force(basically ignoring wound modifiers for any spirit of note).  * Any physical attributes where force is higher than the vessel are increased by half the spirits force (a F6 spirit gives +3 to all physical attributes if your attributes are lower than 5) * use the spirits initiative dice"
Shadowrun,3e1yzj,Bamce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"from what i understand any mage can take that though it says to treat the spirit as if it has possession, not that the spirit needs possession, so all of those bonuses are not exclusive to possession traditions. All this really did was make me think even less of possession traditions as channeling allows other traditions to do one the things that makes possession strong, the living vessel ability.  ps: living vessel is allready kinda weak considering as other people said in this thread its weaker then a spirits normal resistances to damage, meaning spirits while possessing some one are actually weaker then if they had just manifested, so  the living vessel bonus is only really good when you possess yourself but then you are down an ally in combat"

Sustaining spells on myself.  You can order a bound spirit to sustain a spell you cast for a service per day of Sustaining.  It is kind of demeaning to a spirit to ask it to do just this though. Adding dice to my pool.  In a worst case scenario you can add dice to your pool by consuming the force of a bound spirit.  The spirit really doesn't like being used in this way, but sometimes it's the difference between a run staying smooth or going sour.    Edit: Also something I've found most DMs appreciate is the phrase ""I order my spirit to go deal with X spirit."" Most DMs will throw a couple rolls, compare forces and just decide who wins that round.  Thus effectively removing two units from a combat.  Always make your DMs life easier, he's more likely to not kill you."
Shadowrun,3e1yzj,CheetahSnake,2,Tue Jul 21 12:15:13 2015 UTC,"In 5e Bound spirits can't sustain spells for a day, let alone an hour, more like a few Combat Turns.    p302: ""It can’t do this forever—only for its Force in Combat Turns for each service you spend on spell sustaining""  Arguably you could get a Spirit of Man to sustain his Innate spell, but that'd be a GM call and SUCH a big power increase over what's currently allowed that I'd say it'd be a pretty generous house rule..."

""Spell binding: This is like spell Sustaining, but for a lot longer, at the cost of the spirits own force.  The spell you hand off is sustained indefinitely, but the spirit's force is irrevocably reduced by 1 each day (or part thereof) of spell binding.  If the spirit's force is reduced to 0 this way it dissipates forever.  This is very painful for spirits and generally considered to be abusive - if you use this don't forget that word gets around in the spirit world.""  So you CAN, I did forget to mention how bad of an idea it is.  The preferred plan is to use services to sustain it for a number of combat turns.  Usually anything above a force 3 spirit means you get it for a full combat.  Unless you seriously screwed up.  Beyond that, there's no reason a spirit of man couldn't sustain the spell on you as long as its a spell he can target you with.  He follows normal casting rules for any innate spell you choose to summon him with.  Just be aware that when the services are up, that spell is gone."

Shadowrun,3e1yzj,Bamce,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:11 2015 UTC,"My main runner character is a magician with a custom tradition that uses possession and a bunch of ""OP"" spirit types. He's also got the shaman code of honor specifically to help the gm come to grips with how much potential that part of my character has on its own. At our table, when one of my spirits is summoned, it starts on the astral plane (where it acts like any other spirit). It can possess myself on command without any kind of roll, or an object (against an object resistance roll), or another person living or dead (with a normal force*2 vs intuition + willpower roll).  One of my favorite moments was during an extraction run, where we were supposed to pull a genetically modified test subject (on the run from horizon) out of a compound full of gangers. I could tell the GM wanted this to be difficult because the target was not at all willing to talk with us or come along willingly (despite attempts to 'face' him from the only person with good dice for that). The look on my GM's face when I said I wanted my guardian spirit to possess the target and bring him to the extraction point with us safely.. I cherish it.  Target ended up beating the spirit's rolls (I suspect GM dice fudging as 7 hits was not enough) and we had to find another way to get him out. Regardless, it's an example of how to use spirits effectively. Be creative with them, try to use them to solve problems in ways you normally would not be able to.  I'm not sure if there's a canon interpretation, but it's possible that when a spirit possesses a person or object, it will still look as it did before to anyone who can't perceive astrally (not the case at my table). If your gm lets this fly, you could have your spirit possess an innocuous object and get up to all kinds of covert hijinks.   There are all sorts of things that vodou spirits could do for you however. Find an awesome weapon nobody knows how to use? Summon a guardian spirit with relevant weapon skill to use it. Need to fix up your car in a hurry? Summon a task spirit with the relevant technical skill to help out. Is everybody else busy with Legwork and you find yourself with nothing to contribute? Summon a guidance spirit and see what kind of intel you can get out of its divining ability. A spirit of water can give you favorable (or unfavorable) weather conditions. Your spirit of man can turn a vagrant dog into an allied spellcaster. Many spirits offer concealment which is always handy. The Accident ability is exceptional during car chases. Influence, Confusion, Guard, Fear, Movement, etc.  My key piece of advice here is to know what your spirits are capable of and always be thinking of ways to use their powers to creatively solve your problems. My second piece of advice is to not treat your spirits like servants who just do your bidding. A Vodou practitioner especially regards the spirits he works with with reverence, and will not be having them perform menial tasks or anything that a spirit generally finds unpleasant without -great- circumstances."

It was more an example of effectively using them.  As I said, the second bit doesn't work at my table, as normal spirits don't get realistic form, they (and whatever they possess) look clearly supernatural to anyone, even a toaster would thrum with magical power to the normal observer. If his GM thinks otherwise, then a toaster possessed by a spirit will be able to go unnoticed unless astrally observed in some fashion, because it has no behavior to mess up. Obviously a person possessed will act oddly to anyone familiar with them either way."

Basically a mechanical version of the Voice Control Adept power. The Spatial Recognizer is an audio enhancement that helps you pinpoint the source of a sound, by adding +2 to a Perception check.   So I would think that if you had a reason to know Ventriloquism, you could roll with the bonus from the Voice Mod, against the guard's Perception with the bonus if he has a Spatial Recog, to see if he believes your voice came from somewhere else.

Shadowrun,3dztoi,p3ndr4g0n,3,Mon Jul 20 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"Cool Theory! Makes a great deal of sense. (And ties in w/ BSG to boot!) To add to it, from what I'd decided years ago in my head, the only way to fight the Virus was with speed of thought computing capability. The only way to get that was with ASSIST technology. The only way to have full-sensory, speed-of-though (SoT) computing was with fiber optics.  Parallels to this problem exist today. Sight & sound is all you can do via today's best copper cable (& wireless too). That's two (2) senses, and it certainly ain't SoT. SO, when you need 6, 7, or 8 senses to get the hacker over the uncanny valley of the new matrix, and have them not throw up in their sensory deprivation tanks, you'd need (if things were linear) at least 24 copper wires, prob'ly more (we have 4 wire per sense now), and more insulation to cut down on noise. No freakin' way can wireless handle the matrix. Your Aztech PocketSecretary™ can get most info available on the martix, up to MAYBE 3 senses at a time w/o the OS crashing (3 due to evolution of wireless computing and the fact that most users'd only need 3 at a time). But you can only experience the full matrix, and thus only be a good hacker (vs. SoT ICe designed to take out the Crash Virus, iirc), via full immersion, which requires a hard line.  Why do we have wireless now (2070s)? 'Cuz wireless FINALLY caught up and can finally handle all available senses. It's nowhere near necessary that the way wireless has been working up 'til now should dictate the evolution of wireless in SR, but it's been the model for decades, and the Crash put R&D/tech/everyone back a bit."

Round sun glasses to top off the runner chic with trendy look and handy accessories to protect one's eyes from a flare (either from the sun or flashbangs). Auctioneer's Suit with concealed holster on the jacket for trade negotiations gone awry. Standard stuff. Full body armor combined with a ballistic mask for all running needs. Non-flammable, cozy when hiking the Himalaya's and more recently very good for getting zapped with electric security measures. Ruthenium polymer coating added to guard from curious eyes, armor coming out of the wazoo.

Shadowrun,3dzljs,Zemalac,3,Mon Jul 20 21:33:22 2015 UTC,"I'm playing a disguise adept in my current game, so I'm pretty deep into this sort of thing. Some tips from that experience:   Get more than one type of suit, if you can. Synergist or Auctioneer is for your average joe sarariman type. Executive Suite is for when you're playing a bit higher up. Mortimer of London is for when you want to let people know on the down low that you're a shadowrunner. Sleeping Tiger is for when you want to blend in with the mob with some Yakuza-chic. Speaking of Sleeping Tiger, wearing a Synergist longcoat over it is the highest custom fit armor stacking that you can get, with the close second being Mortimer's Berwick-Argentum. Mortimer lets you hide weapons easier, Vashon Island gives you more armor and ruthynium polymer. Your call on which is more important for you. An armor vest and electrochromatic clothing is equivalent to carrying a dozen different outfits with you. Or electrochromatic armor clothing. Same thing either way. Actually, get everything you can electrochromatic. Easiest way to lose a tail, or just disguise stains. Remember the accessories. If you're dressed in a custom tailored Zoe suit, don't take calls on a metalink. You'll look like an idiot. If you get ruthynium polymer on a poncho, you can wear it over anything. Get a bunch of different bags, backpacks and briefcases, to match your outfit. Big Game Hunter is fantastic armor for when you want to go heavy, and doesn't look too out of place if you're driving a pickup truck."
Shadowrun,3dzljs,PinkTrench,3,Tue Jul 21 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"Industrious, Berwick, and Armored Coat cover the basics looks of  Blue Collar, Exec, and Shadows. Those will serve a face great, since at most meets one of those will be appropriate. Seperate accessories are also good at completing a persona. It's just as unlikely that Joe Wageslave could afford rating 4 glasses and ear buds as it is that Mark Executive would be using a rating 2 commlink.  Once you've got your basics down, I'd cover a few more looks. If you're going for the ""Face who can become anyone"" schtick, a set of skillwires can majorly deepen your cover, or just a skill jack so you sound like you know what you're talking about.  Outdoorsman: Whether your target is a corp kid who thinks a guided tour up Mount Ranier makes him legit, or an old war vet who's camped in Sidhe territory so long he calls your com link a pocket sec, sometimes you need to look like a hunter of game instead of a hunter of men. The Ares Big Game hunter (hardcore look though, not very subtle), Globetrotter, or Wild Hunt are pretty good places to start, with a Long arm(stowed like a responsible gun owner unless you're actively hunting), sensory enhancement, traping/fishing equipmentand hunting lisence for props.  Mailman: Throw on an Ares Rapid Transit or an Urban Explorer Jumpsuit, hold a Motorcycle helmet in one hand with a clipboard in the other Edit: Forgot what year it was. with a box under your arm, and there's a lot of recon you can do. Complain loudly about the downturn in work because of all the rotodrone competition, and ask any drivers on the sly about how they feel about their Control Rig implantation.  Homeless guy: The armored coat is a bit too expensive to really sell this. Grab some subtly armored clothes( very grubby), don't bathe, throw on done prosthetic facial hair,set any exprensive devices to Silent slaved to the Decker, and sit on the street corner watching the world (and the marks) go by.

Shadowrun,3dzb0b,Bamce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:34:55 2015 UTC,I mostly improve just about everything on the run. here is a link of information and advice I give out on this kind of subject
Shadowrun,3dzb0b,Feynt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:36 2015 UTC,"Moment to moment, it could be 10% BS or it could be 70% BS.  Sometimes there just aren't any rules for what the players want to do, so you have to go with something similar.  That's just the nature of GMing.  When it comes to enemies the players face off against, I find making them 2-5 dice below the competent runners' stats is adequate.  It makes the players feel like they're ahead of the game, but also poses a significant challenge.  For particularly savvy opponents, like the ones where you're trying to go up against a corp CEO with negotiation, you end up getting a ridiculously above average die pool though (after all, they didn't make it there without some serious wheeling and dealing)."
Shadowrun,3dzb0b,Zemalac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:22 2015 UTC,"I usually plan out the starting conditions of the run pretty thoroughly. Who Mr. Johnson is, who other interested parties are, how they present themselves to the runners if confronted, what their secret agendas are, what levels of force they have, etc.  Then, during the actual game, I wing everything. Goons have dice pools of 6-9. Professionals have 12. Seriously dangerous enemies have 18.  For story improv, I usually default to Chandler's Law--""When in doubt, a man walks through the door with a gun in his hand."" Originally meant for writing pulp detective stories, it works just as well in tabletop. Things are slowing down? Let's all give a warm welcome to that random cop patrol, or to the Halloweeners, or Knight Errant Maximum Force Response."
Shadowrun,3dzb0b,PinkTrench,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:45:54 2015 UTC,"It all depends on gm styles.  I like to prepare and stat out the building, the sec team, and the HTRT, along with some personalities around the building and 2-4 ways I think the run could be done, but there's always the chance that the Runners do something crazy, like the Decker hacking the Faces resume to the top of the application file after they frame a mid level manager to get him fired. Then you just have to hold on and react appropriately."
Shadowrun,3dzb0b,Reoh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:52:05 2015 UTC,"I prefer a blend of prep and winging it.  You start off compiling a folder of goons and NPCs that might come in handy at some point in your world. Then as needed you can wing it by reaching into the file and grabbing what you need.  You can also do this with scene ideas you have that don't have a campaign, or scenes from old campaigns that the players took a detour and skipped. That way you can recycle the good stuff.  May not fit perfectly, so you just twist a few things to fit the situation. Details like the way things look and what not can change to suit the run while one corps guards are more or less akin to another's."
Shadowrun,3dzb0b,veggiesama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:00 2015 UTC,"Something like ""he's a ganger, he gets a 6 dice pool for melee, a 4 for his gun, 6 armor, 8 physical and stun condition boxes, done"" would really speed things up.   Seems reasonable to me. My hope was that Shadowrun 5th Edition would formalize these types of shortcuts into real rules, but unfortunately we'll all be waiting for 6th Edition.  Don't forget to adjust for environmental bonuses (cover) and penalties (vision, etc.). I would also include simple bonuses like smartguns and laser sights (shift attack pools up by +1 or +2), since combat typically relies on a lot more dice being thrown around than other activities. Announcing those things out loud also helps tricking the players into thinking you've actually statted everything out. =P  Also grunts have only 1 condition monitor instead of separate phys/stun boxes.  If you care about tracking ammo, I would probably simplify it to ""They can fire 3 times before reloading"" rather than ""Each full auto shot consumes 10 bullets out of a 32 bullet clip."" It's the players' jobs to track minutia like that, not yours!  Last note: different activities have different expectations for dice pool pools. For example, by using first aid, you're expected to have an additional 1-6 dice to account for the medkit's rating on top of the usual Logic + First Aid. With an R6 medkit, that's like a free 2 hits. Of course, that's why the heal check requires you to get a minimum of 2, and each additional hit beyond the first 2 actually heals boxes. Shadowrun has a lot of weird little minigames like that (see: driving tests), which makes eyeballing thresholds difficult and unintuitive."
Shadowrun,3dzb0b,marwynn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:57 2015 UTC,"To speed things up I've altered what ""Professional Rating"" means. It's the number of hits/net hits a specific group of enemies get. Keeping in mind that my group is not optimized at all. I don't know how it'd work with a group of modestly optimized characters. Our weapon specialist throws 12 dice in shooting SMGs, for example. 14 if he's using his Smartgun.   I would suggest this approach, however. It really speeds things up and it does make things feel a bit more lethal. Do you want to deal with NPCs that are assured 3-5 hits? I still roll for the important NPCs, and my players of course still do.  It helps to have pre-built stuff too. Not just numbers, but situations. You'll need to be able to alter things just to keep it from being a simple ""office"" crawl.   My crew learned the value of Astral Recon (or sensor usage) when the cute receptionist turned out to be chromed like mad. Corporate restructuring meant she was also partly a security guard and shot the group's mage into physical bleedout. They panicked and riddled said receptionist with bullets... gel rounds. Which she ignored after a bit and went back to shooting them. The dice spared them further pain (I was rolling for her) and they finally put her down. Messy.   I had a background written up for that NPC, she was one of my skillwire characters, but that's because I keep making too many characters."

Shadowrun,3dyowx,AtomicSamuraiCyborg,2,Mon Jul 20 16:55:01 2015 UTC,"The problem with buying a new focus is that I've already got 5 force worth of foci already. I can only afford 1 more before I might suffer from addiction. Additionally, our campaign has us in the Philippines now, basically hunting pirates.

Shadowrun,3dyowx,gimlettio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:27 2015 UTC,"You can simply not use the power focus and use a/some sustaining focus/foci instead.  Keeping a simple armour spell or barrier going without penalty has its advantages.  You're also a mystic adept, which begs the question, do you have combat powers?  If so, a power focus could be swapped for a weapon focus to beat people up with when your spells aren't good enough.  Sometimes, beating up a fellow mage instead of casting tons of spells at them is the best option."
Shadowrun,3dyowx,AtomicSamuraiCyborg,6,Tue Jul 21 03:50:37 2015 UTC,"Reagents for your Bound Spirit Army? Foci to make that even easier.  Also, Drones. Having a mundane way to look around places, warn you, etc., is really handy."

Tricked out heavy armor with ruthenium coating, 'cause mages still bleed :D Couple of rating 7 commlinks + mods + Agent 6 so you can protect yourself when your decker isn't around, and do some matrix searches on your own. Tricked out van - ideally a Roadmaster, with changeable Ruthenium coating, spoof chip/morphing license plates,  a few mounted weapons for defense, and your warded Lodge set up inside.  Less vital if you have a rigger with a tricked out one, but it's still nice to have a backup of your own juuuust in case that one gets geeked... Bolthole/bug-out-bag - good SINs + lifestyle held in reserve to use as ultimate fallback when stuff goes really really wrong.  Spare weapons and armor, medkit, vehicle, credsticks, food and water for at least a month, you know the drill.

Shadowrun,3dyowx,Elaphoil,3,Mon Jul 20 19:31:27 2015 UTC,"The game Watchdogs isn't very good but it gave me great inspiration for the ultimate bolthole; cargo shipping containers.  Buy one, insulate it, fit it out like an RV, with bed, water purification system, stove, power hook ups, clothes, medical gear, spare guns and ID's and commlinks, and leave them all over the city. Have them shielded so they don't broadcast anything, sliding doors to open. Have drone trucks drop them off in various isolated spots and have them moved every few weeks. Then you're never far from a bolthole and emergency supplies."

Shadowrun,3dyowx,Bamce,3,Tue Jul 21 04:31:27 2015 UTC,"Increased lifestyle and having well stocked safehouses is useful. You can also pay NPC's for favors, such as introducing you to a high end Fixer or even a high ranking mafia boss. If you have the creds you can make a lot of things happen.  Vehicles are a big expenditure too and you can definitely use more than one, same deal with drones. You can buy gifts for your spirits as well, if they're into that. You can hire trainers to speed up learning times if you use them.   You can gain access to elite places such as the lower floors of Dante's Inferno. Above alll, a wide array of Foci is quite useful to have for various situations that might come up. You can also pay NPC's to keep an eye on your place, do legwork, sense a 'message' and so on.  Mages definitely don't need money as much as other samurai but as your magic increases you need more cash for all your foci, that can really add up, especially if you go deep into campaigns. There is also an optional rule that allows players to convert 2000 nuyen into 1 karma or vice versa, which means you can accelerate you advancement in your specialty. A lot of groups play with that rule."
Shadowrun,3dyowx,Bamce,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:52 2015 UTC,Definitely looking into that  nuyen for karma rule. Would help me and the adept stay caught up! Thanks.
Shadowrun,3dyowx,AtomicSamuraiCyborg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:29:30 2015 UTC,"Generally GMs only agree to that optional rule if it's a good guy thing.  You're offered a few thousand for doing a job, you do the job, but at the end you shrug off the Johnson and say, ""Nah man, I did it to help <insert person/people in need>.  Keep it.""  Nobody else gets your money, you don't get your money, but as a result of doing a good deed you get literal karma.  This of course assumes that you actually did help someone in need during the run, and that it was obvious that it was a thing (running against Humanis for instance to save some ork neighbourhood you heard they were going to hit)."

Shadowrun,3dyowx,ChromeEagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"Well basically, we're being contracted by Renraku to hunt pirates around the Philippines. The freighter was actually theirs originally and we reclaimed it and they bought it back as part of the contract."
Shadowrun,3dyowx,Bamce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:53 2015 UTC,"gonna have to go into a bit more detail. As part if this sounds like adept stole a unreasonably priced item. The other half is ""we were doing a job at an unreasonable payday"""
Shadowrun,3dyowx,ChromeEagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:38:06 2015 UTC,"Well basically in our game, Seattle has become it's own city state. We did a bunch of runs there and so the leadership is paying us to uproot the Japanese occupation in the Philippines. Renraku handles their security and have been having serious piracy issues lately and have put standing bounties out on recovered vessels and pirates. So they're offering half book price for any of their own vessels that are retrieved and 20 percent book price on any pirate vessels we retrieve. We're using the piracy contract as our cover for being in the Philippines.   Our gm wasn't expecting the adept to wingsuit out of our helo and one man the entire vessel, which was on an interception course for our decoy ship that was meant to lure the pirates in. So we commandeered the corvette and sent it back to Renraku for half the book value."
Shadowrun,3dyowx,Bamce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"So basically Renraku is paying you salvage rights for recovering the ship. Half is probably too much, though. And if they're going to pay you legally then there should be taxes and fees and the like, you need to form a corporation or LLC to take the transfer of funds, etc. Or they would offer you a fraction of the listed value in clean credsticks."
Shadowrun,3dyowx,ChromeEagle,3,Mon Jul 20 21:11:32 2015 UTC,Well the way it's being described is that they're basically exasperated with their failures and are hiring mercenaries (I. E. Shadowrunners) in a sort of no questions asked sort of way.  But yes I see where you're coming from. I think the gm was just so surprised that he didn't really think too much about his options.

It is perfectly acceptable to cast spells with a spellcasting focus and then turn it off and turn your sustaining foci on.

A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special Attributes (Initiative, Edge, Essence, Magic, or Resonance). The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the (augmented) value of the Attribute being affected. The Attribute is increased by an amount equal to the hits scored, up to the target’s augmented maximum (any hits that would increase the Attribute beyond its augmented maximum are ignored). Each Attribute can only be affected by a single Increase Attribute spell at a time. Note that increasing an Attribute may affect other derived statistics (Increase Reaction also affects Initiative, for example, while Increase Body adds extra boxes to the character’s Physical Condition Monitor for as long as the spell lasts).   The force of the spell must equal of exceed the (augmented) value of the attribute being affected.  Thus what your doing, unintentionally, is breaking the rules."

Lifestyles, Licenses/Fake SINs, membership dues in your Magical Group, contact upkeep, gear repair, research.  There are a LOT of things to spend nuyen on!"
Shadowrun,3dyowx,Tyrhaynes,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:10 2015 UTC,"Reagents are good to grab, as mages can burn through those fast on binding.  Different armor sets as well as firearms are a good pick too. While guns are not your focus the right outfit is critical, sometimes you want to be loud and proud with FBA and a rifle and sometimes it is the berwick combo with a pistol and electricity resistance because you know tasers and S&S are in play.  However once you got a full kit and a pile of reagents then you go to SR's default cash sinks, mainly sensors, jammers, and drones.  Sensors, especially sensor tags, are as hideously useful as they are expensive, and also tend to get left behind, so spending cash there is helpful.  Jammers, likewise, often are best left somewhere ahead of time making their recovery uncertain.  Drones, ironically enough, are amazing for the same reasons riggers are terrible, there is so much power inside the drone that you don't really need too many skills to make them useful. Just mindlessly setting a rotodrone to attack someone, even without an RCC and with just autosofts, can severely injure them when fired on full auto, and at least reduces their dodge dice. Small drones can carry sensors and scout, and you can use them as suicide bombers too."

It isn't necessarily that they'll get the penalties for showing up to a scummy bar somewhere, but if they have to stay there for a couple of hours (on a stakeout for instance), they'll gradually get more and more irritated by the environs.  I tend to impose this penalty when runs end up going long, and the crew needs to hold up in a safe house somewhere (that isn't the right lifestyle).  The lifestyler will be irritable and start bitching about the situation they're in, and how they don't even have a mocha latte with a triple espresso shot to comfort them (you know, the 20¥ drinks that rich people buy a dozen of per day)."
Shadowrun,3dyzfi,Feynt,3,Mon Jul 20 18:30:41 2015 UTC,"Unless he's in the Seedy bar for more than 24 hours, it wouldn't apply."
Shadowrun,3dyzfi,PinkTrench,2,Mon Jul 20 22:31:18 2015 UTC,"The creature of comfort quality basically says they don't like being in a lower quality area for a long time.  But I take it to mean spending extended periods (like a stakeout in a seedy bar for 3 or 4 hours, or crashing at someone's low lifestyle apartment overnight to dodge cops) is also disconcerting.  Basically any time they are ""resting"" for a prolonged period of time, a situation where they might recover stun damage a few times for example, they'll encounter this negative quality until they can spend time in their comfort zone.  Whether it's a club, a slum library, someone's crappy apartment, or a precinct in the Redmond barrens (if such a thing exists), staying for a long time will see them practically itching to get back to the level of comfort they're accustomed to."
Shadowrun,3dyzfi,Feynt,7,Mon Jul 20 23:33:41 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, and that could be a quality, but it just isn't what the book says.  The last paragraph of page 153 of Run Faster begins""For every day that the character must spend 'slumming it'..."". A character with Creature of Comfort (High) probably won't feel at ease in a seedy Redmond Bar. He'll feel like sitting on the stools is ruining his 5 grand real wool slacks, and probably won't even let their mugs touch his lips. But he won't start taking cumulative -3 penalties to Socials and Healing as long as he can go home and bask in his 20 nozzle steam shower while his house drone ""hand"" cleans and presses his suit."

Whether or not it applies to a meet in a seedy bar, walking in an alleyway or having to get stitched up at a street doc's squat in Renton are matters for the GM to decide upon.

Shadowrun,3dyulq,majinspy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:17 2015 UTC,"That's a tall order. The matrix is the second toughest part of any edition of shadowrun, with the toughest part being the rules for rigging. How deep in are you that you're having trouble? Do you have the basic idea down that you roll attribute+skill in the real world but matrix attribute + program rating in the matrix? Also what method of character creation is your table using?"
Shadowrun,3dyulq,MrPierson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:37:37 2015 UTC,I'm still building it.. and I'm very confused on what to pick..
Shadowrun,3dyulq,MrPierson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:03 2015 UTC,Right but do you understand the actual game mechanics? It is very difficult to make a character not matter what role you want to fill if you don't understand the actual game mechanics. Also what method of character creation are you using? Is it build points or is it karma creation?
Shadowrun,3dyulq,MrPierson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:14 2015 UTC,build points.. I'm reading through the core book right now but it seems complex.
Shadowrun,3dyulq,Tondirr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"Good. Now we're getting somewhere. All of shadowrun's mechanics are some variation of Roll (skill + attribute)d6 and count up the 5's and 6's you get. The more 5's and 6's, the better you did. Now in the real world your attributes are just your physical and mental scores like Strength, Logic, Agility, etc, but in the matrix your attribute is the rating of the program you are running. For example if you were trying to shoot a guy you would roll (Agility + Pistols)d6, while if you were trying to edit a file you would roll (Edit Program + Computer skill)d6. You can find some summaries on how these rolls are made here"

Also, if you're GM hasn't played with technomancers before your GM might not like dealing with them because now they have to know a very different set of technomancer rules."
Shadowrun,3dxiy6,Milestoned,13,Mon Jul 20 10:27:43 2015 UTC,"Hacking is the most complex aspect of the game and while it can be incredibly fun it has a reputation spanning across decades of being the best way to bog down a game and make people bored. A large reason for this is very few people know how it actually works.  What I would suggest is for you to download 'cheat sheets'. Here is a link to a decent set although there are better out there but I forget where specifically. http://www.extell.us/sr/Shadowrun_5th_Edition_Cheat_Sheet.pdf  The second option is to opt out of the hacker role. It is HARD and bordering on impossible for a new player that isn't familiar with the game on a decent level. This game is VERY fun but starting off like this could ruin the game for you and it would be a terrible waste.  If you do decide to stick it out you should read the entire matrix chapter(except the technomancer portion) 2-3 times. Try to remember how the matrix looks and whats in it. Understand hosts, icons, devices, personas, etc. After that you need to have a rough idea of what matrix actions to use. There is often multiple ways to get things done in the matrix but essentially you need to use attack actions/programs or sleaze actions/programs.  Figure out what you want to do, decide on attack or sleaze, pick your matrix action and get marks if needed, then pick which program to run. Try to keep it as simple as possible and get your GM to take it very easy on you.  You could have a lot of fun but it won't be a walk in the park. If you're not ready to do some studying I would suggest that you play a more combat oriented character that has a decent skillset for one other aspect of the game. A good example would be a street samurai who is good at First Aid, good with Intimidation or Breaking and Entering.  It's easiest to learn the game by playing the more simple characters (non hackers, non riggers, non magicians). I'd say street samurai is your best bet if you want to learn the game at a reasonable pace and have a good time."
Shadowrun,3dxiy6,ChromeEagle,5,Mon Jul 20 10:43:37 2015 UTC,"I guess I should bog down and (re)read the Matrix section of the core book again.  Luckily the Shadowrun Cyberdeck Aid helped me a lot already. It gave me the dice pools I needed, so at least I didn't have to keep track of the number of dice myself.  I have yet to read Data Trails, is that the big corebook expansion for Deckers/Technomancers?"
Shadowrun,3dxiy6,ChromeEagle,4,Mon Jul 20 10:55:07 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. It is really hard for any player to memorize all the rules, there are just so many! The more you read that chapter, the better you'll absorb it. I will say though, I think it's really important to know the structure of the matrix moreso than the rules. If you understand how the general matrix works you will intuitively have a better feel for what you want to do as a hacker.  Data Trails is in the mail and heading to my house as we speak and yes it is the big matrix book. I hear it's much more focused on Deckers. You don't need it to handle the matrix and I'd recommend not using it at all until you have some experience in the matrix just using the core rules. Keep it as simple as possible for now :)  Cudos to you for tackling the beast that is the matrix!"

A large reason for this is very few people know how it actually works.   Best way to do it is to break it off into chunks. If the party isn't that matrix heavy, simply ignore Grid rules. Assume that everything is on the local citywide/country grid and makes it easier on everyone.   Second is fudge the rules until you and the players have a better understanding of what's going on. Allow them easy wins (IC fucks up more often than it should, Overwatch isn't increased by failed attack or sleaze rolls, etc) and then start introducing the rule more and more.   Third, remind the players right off the bat that it's easier to attack a host via one of it's slaved devices than simply bashing it wirelessly. Devices are always weaker than the Host and getting a mark on a device allows both mark on it and more importantly, the host. This is a feature, not a bug."

Don't forget that drugs are your friend, popping some jazz just as a fight begins is a great way to boost your initiative to give you the time to get into cover, and if you're not directly in the firing line then VR gives you another 3-4d6 worth of initiative and passes for hacking actions.  A decker is one of the 2 most flexible classes (the other being mage) and as such the sky is the limit for what you want to do. Almost everything is wireless and if its wireless you can hack it! Id recommend the signal scrub program or mods to reduce noise if you're finding that its a problem.  Do you have cerebral boosters at rating 2? taking your logic from 6 to 8 is a massive boon to offensive hacking actions.  In terms of changing ownership - I'm sorry but your gm is wrong there.

Shadowrun,3dxiy6,-Pin_Cushion-,2,Mon Jul 20 11:09:22 2015 UTC,"What does your character sheet look like?   You can find my char sheet here.  This is actually the second revision, the GM allowed me to edit it because the way I was introduced into the campaign essentially threw all my prior preparations/plans of how my character came to be into the wind. So with this one I already have a few more points in reaction to help my Initiative.   Int is important for various matrix tests and shouldn't be that low, was the fight over because everyone else was cybered up street sams?   Well, I joined the party after it apparently existed for quite a while, and they already gathered up nearly 100 karma. Currently they're playing a campaign called ""the three books"" or something like that and we were attacked by some super high-class goon troop.  But the fight was over because we bailed - one of the players laid down suppressive fire, and once I reached safety (2-3 passes later I think) the rest decided to better run off too. Still, I wish I could've done at least something other than running for dear life.   In terms of changing ownership - I'm sorry but your gm is wrong there. Ownership of a matrix device is tied to a persona and can only be changed through a very tough extended hardware test where you have access to the phsyical device and can replace parts of the circuits (hidden RFID tags and the like broadcasting the owner need to be changed if the owner isn't actually giving you the device).   I see, I figured it can't be that easy. Though I had physical access to the device (I was in the plane and had several hours to kill), I did do an extended test. I forgot the target rating, but it took me about 3 hours (at 30 minute intervals). In hindsight it also probably wasn't the smartest idea to do that in flight, don't want to brick the plane you're flying in, right? But we were worried the original owner would find out somehow that his plane is not stored away safely in a hangar but is actually above the English Channel right about now.   However changing the flight plan is a great idea and exactly the kind of creative thinking you need to be a shadowrun decker! If you were failing the rolls then check your gm wasn't being too harsh about the rating of the protective host (a government host should only be around rating 7 - and most airports are still government owned as far as I know) Don't forget to spend edge for really important rolls or to reroll if things go wrong.   It almost went too well after that. Basically we strolled into the airstrip (It basically had a tiny little building, a hangar and one strip), some airport personell noticed us and asked us what we wanted.  I explained that we're here for flight 1183 that was scheduled for take-off at 8 AM sharp. He checked my fake SIN (the one I edited the flight plan to expect) and we were good to go, the machine was already ready for take-off - per my orders, as I (tried to) made it seem like the owner wanted her fuelled up and ready to go.  The engineer who prepped the plane (a VTOL turboprop) jumped out and wished us a nice flight and.. we were off!  I couldn't believe we managed to just take off like that (luckily our rigger knows how to pilot a plane), and I spent the time during the take-off sequence plundering the bar (it was a private plane after all) and fist-pumping in front of the mirror in the restroom.  So I guess that was kinda awesome!"
Shadowrun,3dxiy6,ozurr,3,Mon Jul 20 11:42:05 2015 UTC,"It almost went too well after that.    Your team came up with a fairly creative solution that required a lot of teamwork and improvisation, was cool, and didn't involve blowing giant holes in everything for no damned reason.  And, at the end of the day, this was all to get you to the actual story.  If I were the GM I'd have tossed you a gimme as well.  Just don't get too comfy with the plane.  I wouldn't plan on the actual owner just writing off the loss that quick.  When he finds out his plane's gone he's gonna be pissed!"
Shadowrun,3dxiy6,ozurr,3,Mon Jul 20 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"It seems it's not just you having an issue with the Matrix rules.  You said:   The noise (3) and my deck running silent already removed 5 dice from my dice pool   Which is true, but the Wireless bonus on your Datajack removes 1 noise and the Signal Scrub program removes another 2 noise.  That means you're still throwing 16 dice at hacking the host with a Sleaze action (possibly 17 with Exploit, away from book so I don't recall the bonus on that program).    Okay, so that was a lot of jargon.  Boiling it down, that 5 dice penalty should've only been 2 because of your cyberware and your programs, and your Qualities and programs would've added additional dice to compensate.  Now, regarding combat:  You're a squishy computer wizard, you don't want to be in a straight-up fight.  That's what your samurai are for - meatspace security solutions.  Don't feel bad that you didn't have the initiative to run with them, you did everything right by getting the hell away.  If they had chosen to make a stand, you could then go into Matrixspace, your initiative spikes to run with them, and you can start hacking cars to throw at the bad guys, jamming wireless signals so they can't call for backup, etcetera.  My advice is to keep with it.  You've got a solid character, I'd recommend applying Karma to your Edge stat as soon as you can to bring your reroll capability up, and rely on your team to handle the meatspace while you work on the Matrix.  Yes, there will be times they seem bored, but don't be afraid to ask the other players for advice on how they want the Matrix game to conclude in their favor.  Now, as a decker, your strengths are going to be in Matrix searches, Matrix Perception, and of course Hacking.  You have the power to find the security team based on the wireless signal of their commlinks and smartlinks, jam their phone calls, hack the fire door so they can't get through, or even steal or disable their car in pursuit.  In the interconnected world of 2075-76 you don't need eyes to see - you have the Matrix telling you so much more information than they think they're giving out.    Through matrix searches, you can find all the public background info on what you're up against.  Social media feeds, floor plans, expected security plans, schedules - you can find all of these things while the team is negotiating their payout (and help your negotiator with information saying 'hey, he says <X> but the matrix says <Y>.  That's worth another couple bucks, yeah?'  The plane job was super wiz, and you should be proud of that.  That's the kind of thing you can do.  Why hail a cab when you can sleaze a low-rating host and schedule a limo to pick you up to arrive in style?  Why go out to the Stuffer Shack when you can intercept a delivery drone in flight to deliver snackies to the dead drop near your safehouse?  The world is your oyster, limited only by your imagination.  :P"

Shadowrun,3dxiy6,Feynt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:12:20 2015 UTC,"The noise reduction is explicitly the wireless bonus.  It's...nngh...internet magic.  I have no real explanation other than that's the rules as written. Take a look in the core book for the wireless bonuses for the datajack, and see if there is a bonus for having an implanted cyberdeck as well.  Every little bit helps.  It's great to hear you're excited!  Keep in mind that you can rearrange your deck stats to darn near your heart's content (only requires a...Simple action?) and the programs you have can increase the limits on your deck for the programs you use most so you can utilize all those successes you get.    Changing the registry of a plane so you can use it is only the tip of the iceberg. :D  Changing ownership of items entirely, though, is a rabbit hole you may not want to go down unless you talk it over with your GM first.  If the GM says it's all right, start boosting your Hardware and your Edge scores and keep in mind that it will take hours, if not days, to change the ownership of items."
Shadowrun,3dxiy6,Feynt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:01 2015 UTC,"I actually managed to re-write the ownership of the plane - in flight - to myself. Threw some lucky dice, and after 3 hours in the air I did it. In hindsight it probably wasn't the smartest idea, I was one critical glitch away from crashing the plane into the English Channel. :I  Though I think the GM mostly winged it, what are the official rules (if they exist) for rewriting the ownership of an object? Is it an opposed test against the rating of the object itself, or is it still somehow slaved to the owner (even a plane?)."
Shadowrun,3dxiy6,autourbanbot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:50 2015 UTC,"Going off of memory, but I think the threshold is the device rating in an extended test, interval 1 hour, Hardware test.

Shadowrun,3dxiy6,EinsamWulf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, so actually not that impossible. Huh.  ... I think my decker might get a slight kleptomaniac streak in him."
Shadowrun,3dxiy6,Einbrecher,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:10 2015 UTC,"So changing ownership of a device requires an extended hardware test.  You succeeded in an extended test, presumably that one, so of course everything goes well.  You own the plane now.  Nobody can take it from you (though they can hack in and wrest control of the auto pilot from you, unless you stop them) unless they too have several minutes/hours to spend rejiggering the plane's ownership routine.  All in all it was a good plan, setting up the false flight plan, and you did it right.  Doing the ownership change while flying...  Critical glitches mean crashes, or would in my campaign.  So, not the best of ideas, but you got the job done, and critical glitches with 10+ dice are rare.  As for meat world initiative, don't worry about it.  Your job isn't to go pew pew with the others.  Your job is to find a safe corner, drop into VR where your initiative is on par with those cybered up goons, and hack all the things.  Brick their guns!  Eject their clips!  Hack their wireless grenades and set them off!  If you want to be on par with the other runners, look into getting some wired reflexes.  But remember that aside from hacking in AR (the matrix equivalent of astral perception) you're not going to benefit from them when it comes time to do your job.  Remember:  Run for cover, drop into VR.  Next turn you roll lots more dice for initiative and can start hacking with the others.    As for hacking being boring for the others...  Yes.  It will be.  Often times if there's a chance of pre-planning for a run, a GM will pull the decker aside and give them the opportunity to do a matrix run without the others.  This means you and the GM, one on one, doing the matrix thing from the relative safety of your house (or a coffee shop, library, whatever) while you hack the Gibson.  If you have to hack on the fly during a session with the others, it's best to know what you need to roll ahead of time.  That's where the cheat sheet comes in, but having the cyberdeck aid from the Google play store helps immensely as well.  Reading over the matrix rules multiple times so you understand what can be done with marks and what bricking a device will entail will also help.  The GM has to remember everything, you just need to remember combat and matrix rules.  Hacking by initiative order is also a way to slow down the game.  Sometimes you're just searching for stuff or doing innocuous hacking (sleazing your way into a place silently).  During these low risk times initiative is, in my opinion, unnecessary.  It's only when things start to take notice of you that initiative is important, and even then I reserve it for ""You botched the sleaze attempt, their commlink buzzes at them a notification about your hacking.  Roll initiative.""  I'm a nice guy in those cases.  If you score 21+ on your initiative, you have an opportunity to edit the notification to be something bullshit like ""You may have already won!"", since you've got 1-2 seconds (3 seconds per combat round, 21+ will give you 3 actions) to work with before someone can take out their commlink, turn it on, and mentally process the message they've received.  Fail to do it in time, and people get twitchy, possibly on the level of ""Sound the alarms, there's a decker around!""  This is all assuming of course you aren't doing anything during a fire fight for the others, then of course initiative is important for keeping track of what you can do while they do their thing (like keeping your meat safe, while plugging the guards you're trying to hack).  And as others mentioned, always include the others in your decision making processes.  You're blazing through the matrix at the speed of thought, their image links are your bitches to communicate with them.  Let them know what you can do, or ask them what they need, and act on those needs.  Not having agency is what bores people.  If they're there making decisions with you, they have agency in the whole matrix operation.  Otherwise, they can be doing meat world stuff to prepare while you hack.  Taking aim, setting door busting explosives, casting sustainable spells, etc."
Shadowrun,3dxiy6,gimlettio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:04:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Yeah, I forgot I was able to communicate with my team-mates directly while diving in full VR. I'll try to work more with them next time.  I have/had the cheatsheet ready, but when push comes to shove I'm still a little overwhelmed at the options, and what is the right ""action"" to do.  For example I wasn't sure - if I search a file on a host, is that a Matrix Perception or a Matrix Search test?  I believe the book says it's Matrix Search even if I'm on a host, but I'm not entirely sure."
Shadowrun,3dxiy6,gimlettio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:16:15 2015 UTC,"Matrix perception is for finding hidden icons, like deckers running silent.  It's analogous to the Perception skill versus someone's Stealth skill.  To ""search"" for a file, you use Matrix Search.  The file isn't hidden (sometimes), it's just stacked on a shelf somewhere in a library that is (effectively) infinitely huge.  Most of the operations make a certain kind of sense if you think about them and what they are called.  They either relate to a meat world skill or action, or they tell you what they do right in the name (Grid Hop or Crash Program for instance)."

Shadowrun,3dxiy6,gimlettio,2,Tue Jul 21 11:23:17 2015 UTC,"You've touched on the fun, and frustrating, part of being a hacker. There are tons of options out there.  Your best bet is to read over the rules. Then read them again. And again. The fewer times you have to look at the rulebook, the better off you'll be. Moving quickly with matrix stuff also uses less time at the table, so other players may be more engaged as well.  Regarding how to handle scenarios, keep in mind that the sorts of things you're doing are quick and dirty. You might change ownership of that plane over, but someone, at some point, is going to notice it's missing. When they come back for it, they'll have the full, legal force of a hacking team behind them, unless you find some way to mitigate that as well.  You need to be creative and abstract, because the ""typical"" modes of doing things are probably already secured against. Case and point, during one of my first hacking experiences (and first time playing Shadowrun, or any tabletop RPG for that matter) we infiltrated a yacht to recover a hard drive from the safe on board. At that time, there was a big party going on - so lots of people, and lots of security. I was able to add our guys to the guest list, but couldn't do much else otherwise I'd attract the spider's attention. Everyone but me (I stayed in the small boat we had) went on in, and they physically took care of said spider. After that, I dove in and pretty much owned the system.  ""Is there a security system on board with drones and/or guns?"" ""Yeah."" ""How does it know who to shoot or who not to shoot?"" ""Well, you know about the guest list, and you've also found a list of approved personnel."" ""Alright.

Another present-day example: http://www.sandisk.com/about-sandisk/press-room/press-releases/2008/2008-07-15-sandisk-introduces-write-once-memory-cards-for-applications-where-recorded-data-must-be-unalterable/  Not that this is 100% ""gotcha"" security - for starters so much of this usually-boring stuff is written that except for top-top-top-top security installations nobody is going to be checking it day to day let alone realtime, so if the run is pulled off without anyone noticing, maybe some anomaly will be noticed a few weeks later in a random audit.   Even in a noticed run where it'd be among the evidence reviewed there's probably not going to be any traceable information, but it would give some pointers to at least the beginning of what was done.  In a case like this though, where the personnel list was modified with presumably identifying information - SIN?  photo?  That could be a bit sticky for the runners.  Or was it just a fake corporate ID that would lead to nothing usable?"

Based on what you've actually written, you're dissatisfied by the way you rolled that evening and you're frustrated by your lack of rules knowledge.  As the hacker of the group (be it as an AI, Decker or Technomancer) it's your job to be a master of the hacking rules. Shadowrun is a complex game system and it's a bit unfair to make the GM do all the work. If you're okay with that, then do some research and check out the sidebar.

Don't worry about covering a needed archetype. A shadowrunner team without a decker will not get hired to do jobs that require a decker. It's your GM's job to work with what he's got as far as players. That said, if you happen to run into a situation and think ""I wish we had a decker"" it's not really your GM's fault that the team doesn't have one, unless decking/hacking is the only possible solution to the problem."

Needs a bit more dystopia for me to say it's in the Shadowrun-style, we do have corporate influence and the like throughout the movie though.   More direct spoilers here:  His team however was a pure street runner team. You have a hacker, a rigger, a ""Face"" of sorts, and of course the B&E expert/adept. They even have a van and most importantly were a lot of fun to watch.   A part of me wants to twist this into an Insect Spirit Hive story of some kind."

Shadowrun,3dwse4,xyrafhoan,3,Mon Jul 20 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"Completely agree here. I felt like the Ant Man suit was a good stand-in for the magical elements of Shadowrun to pull off a heist against what is basically analogous to an AA corp. Pym is a bit more open to his expendable asset than most Johnsons would be but otherwise his method of testing Scott Lang felt spot on. And then Scott's crew has the face, the decker and overwatch present, though they are more street level crew working their way up to something better. Honestly there was a lot of inspiration to take from here, as with any heist movie, but this was a little more magical feeling than most."

Shadowrun,3dwse4,makoberonn,7,Mon Jul 20 12:26:17 2015 UTC,"It's not that certain questions are frowned upon, it's that (as /u/LemurianLemurLad said), the way you were asking them looked like a set-up for some snarky, eye-rolling comment.  ""Did it have these iconic Shadowrun elements?  No?  Then surely it had these elements?  No?  Then yes, I can definitely see how you thought it was like Shadowrun.""  But the thing is, you can have a Shadowrun game with almost none of those elements.  For example, you could have a game set in mainland Europe with a group of mystic adepts and mages who are contracted to investigate paranormal killings, ritual magic, and to track down and eliminate blood mages/toxic shamans/bug spirits while exploring European myth and legend as seen through the lens of Shadowrun.  No drones.  No chrome.  No salarymen.  Still Shadowrun.  Don't get me wrong, it's true that the first thing everyone tends to think of with Shadowrun is chromed troll street sammies squaring off against Red Samurai in some madcap heist gone wrong, but it's doing a disservice to the setting to imply that that's all there is to it."

Shadowrun,3dwse4,garner_adam,11,Mon Jul 20 07:47:28 2015 UTC,"No but then again it is very possible to play a Shadowrun game without all of those elements.  Neo-Anarchists are much weaker and less of a staple than back in first. A game in Berlin or most of the NAN or either of the Tirs is going to have little Japanese influence.   It had ant drones controlled via the mind like a rigger which is way cooler. Bio drones rock.  Dystopia. Threat of a world in chaos. Corporations, corruption, and secret societies bent on world domination.  It had a heist for a prototype technology. It had a hacker, an infiltrator, a getaway driver, a face etc.  It had someone taking down a megacorp prior and during the movie because it was the right thing to do.   It had heavily armed security forces.  Good enough for me to feel comfortable making the comparison."

Shadowrun,3dwlz9,FloobyBadoop,11,Mon Jul 20 03:31:59 2015 UTC,"For me at least it falls under two categories: Professionalism and Connection.   The first one should be obvious to anyone who took the time to read the fluff in any of the Shadowrun core books, professionalism means that you (the runner) gets in and out with as little damage as possible. You don't kill, even if you are met with lethal force, unless you have to. You don't destroy property just for the hell of it. You don't do any number of this that could be seen as downright stupid (five 'yen says some runner thought it was funny to take a dump in a execs car at least once). The corps. know that hunting you down would ultimately cost far more than taking a loss, but that stops when things get personal or public. If a runner team paints the walls red of their fancy new facility the will hunt them down with extreme prejudice if only so that the people within their own organization won't rebel against them for injustice (those wageslaves will only put up with so much, and their masters know it).  The second thing is connection. A corp. can find out who you are through DNA or astral or the 'trix, but do they want to touch you? This is the unwritten rule of having a good fixer and a good face, if people want your services and the corp. takes them away knowingly or otherwise they are going to feel slighted. I wouldn't be surprised at all if more than one ""meeting"" was had because Mitsuhama either tried or succeeded to kill a runner for doing Yak business.   If tracking you down costs money with no chance of returning what was lost AND you are going to piss off your friends in the process, well that's two damn good reasons to not bother chummer. Far better instead to consolidate your evidence and offer it to those runners as ""incentive"" to return the favor to whomever was behind the first run at a slightly reduced pay."

You're taking away a useful tool from your rivals. Which conveniently leads to...  2) Get them and find out what rival hired them, what your opponents know, blackmail them so they don't have to pay them, etc."
Shadowrun,3dwlz9,Listener-of-Sithis,5,Mon Jul 20 04:37:32 2015 UTC,"You're taking away a useful tool from your rivals.    Which is one of the main reasons most corps don't do this!  Shadowunners exist because the corps want them to.  If one corp starts messing with that and making a habit of removing active runners from the community, this harms all the other corps that use those resources.    The tragedy of the commons...   Get them and find out what rival hired them, what your opponents know, blackmail them so they don't have to pay them, etc.   And this is the reason that Shadowrunners always get hired by ""Mr Johnson"" and told some bullshit about who they're working for and why they're doing what they're doing..."
Shadowrun,3dwlz9,cyronius,2,Mon Jul 20 04:41:34 2015 UTC,"The 'tragedy of the commons' is called 'tragedy' because without enforced rules, the common resource will get depleted because there is no incentive for the individual to watch out for the resource.  Take a corporation that has the reputation to be revengeful. If you do a run against them you will regret it. Runners won't like these contracts and won't take the run or will demand high payment. This proactively reduces the chance that a run started against them in the first place. This is good for the corporation. Will this reduce the chance that runners will work for them? Well, only if the runners mind that their ""friends"" got killed by the corporation after their run. But this is honor stuff and that's unprofessional. Plus, if you don't do it, others will. It's a free market! Plus, they knew the risk. That's why they were handsomely paid.  So why aren't runners always hunted by the corporations? Because it's not always cost-efficient.   A reputation only works if people know that the runners were killed because of a specific run. If other people don't know this (because they were killed silently or because no one knows the reason) there is no point. That's why you don't brag about your run. Finding runners and killing them costs money and if you fail it costs even more (except when they use other runners...) your reputation will be damaged. The corporation can't not only defend it's property, it can't even get proper revenge!  The corporation has to be somewhat open about wanting to kill you. There might be legal troubles involved. Runners have fake SINs. However, these SINs claim that the runner is a member of a certain community or even a corportation! This community can now claim compensation for the illegal death of one of their members. Will they do this? Well, it depends because how discreet the killing was. But discretion isn't the point in revenge (see above). Therefore it might be better to just imprison them. But that might proof even more difficult than killing them. Again the cost rises.    Eventually, it boils down to the followung: The corporation might want revenge. They might stop wanting to do that if you show them that it's not cost-efficient (by escaping, killing the assassins, etc.). But the best thing is prevention by anonymity and professionalism. Don't give them hints and reasons to seek you out."

Those who can't really chose can still demand higher payment because of this policy.  Both a win for Mitsuhama. Fewer attacks on them and attacks that are relatively more expensive.  So why doesn't everyone has this policy? Because if extreme measures will immediately be used then the runners themselves will quickly resort to extreme measures. Things escalate quickly, much damage is done. ""We are dead anyway so why should I look out for civilians such as those highly-trained scientists?"" Some corporations want to avoid that."

Yeah that's what I was getting at. There are (self imposed) rules and expectations in place on how the corps deal with Shadowrunners exactly because they're a common resource.   Take a corporation that has the reputation to be revengeful. If you do a run against them you will regret it.    The other corps tend to take a dim view of such behaviour by a corp though, because it impacts their ability to perform day to day business, and that power censure is the driver behind ensuring that corps don't get to trigger happy with revenge runs.   So why aren't runners always hunted by the corporations? Because it's not always cost-efficient.   I went in to detail on that elsewhere in this discussion. We're in agreement here..."

Even when Johnsons are relatively open about who they work for (Which is not uncommon) the point of runners is that they are deniable assets, not assets who don't tip their corps hands. The nature of most jobs makes it already self evident who hired the team, because the person hiring the runners is going to be getting a stock bump next week.  It is why revenge plots basically don't happen in shadowrun canon between the runners and their target as long as the runners were not butchers (And no, shooting APDS at HTR doesn't make you a butcher, slitting Bob the security guard's throat does). There is no point. Most revenge occurs for much pettier reasons. Corporations are many things, but they are not petty enough to waste the black bag budget on some runners."

Shadowrun,3dwlz9,McBoobenstein,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"So other people have covered when it becomes cost-effective/reasonable for a corp to spend resource tracking down a team (dropping bodies - especially civilians - taking a few tasty-looking goods on the side, or excessive property destruction), but if, like in your scenario, they already know who it is, then they won't try to kill the runner(s), unless of course it's for revenge or to save face after a particularly bloody or destructive encounter, but they will blackmail the runners into becoming their pawns.  Not corporate employees or anything (unless they're really good), but making sure the runner's tell the corp details on all their jobs, and that they work at a discount for that corp, if the corp wants them to.  Of course, there are plenty of reasons they might do any of a million different things if they had found the identity of a runner as easily as a quick DNA cross-reference. They could hand the information over to local law enforcement, or just send their own team after them, if they wanted to silence them (if valuable paydata was stolen) or intimidate others (if it was a particularly publicised or high value run)."

The military wants a certain track record before it buys a few million of a particular item.  Runners, however, will buy an untested product (because it's ""Bleeding Edge""), field test the hell out of it, and often find solutions to any bugs/flaws in the product before it ever hits general use.  In addition, a product that's ""The Favorite of Shadowrunners"" is likely to get featured in some of the trid-shows trying to be more authentic.  That's going to increase exposure and sales to the general public.  Runners are part of the product cycle, even beyond their direct uses.

Which means hitting a team of Shadowrunners out of simple revenge (and letting the streets know who hit them) is admitting to the other corps that you're pissing in the pool you all share.     Thus my question to you all, is where should one draw the line? When is the damage too great, the hit to one's reputation too blatant, to let slide?   The corps that will do this are the corps that don't care if they piss off the rest in whatever region the runners are operating in.  So Aztechnology might take revenge in its own territory to make runners think twice about hitting them, because the other corps have smaller presences in the area.    The other corps that will do it are the ones that are willing to wear the notoriety for the reprieve it might bring them.

A runner teams absolutely trashes your R&D facility, lets say, and now everyone knows you're weak. People are going to take this opportunity to kick you while you're down if you don't fight back.   So, you look up the team that hit you, and find they're just another dime-a-dozen band of buffoons. You could go after the corp that just hit you, but that's far more costly than just geeking the team that hit you. And if you did that, you'd achieve the same results for much less.  As well, I don't believe for a moment that corps wouldn't go after runner teams for hitting them just to dissuade runners from working against them.   If you found out any time you made a run against X corp, whether you succeeded or not, a hit squad would come after you, would you want to take jobs against them? I wouldn't.   Would you take jobs for them? I bet there are plenty of amoral runners out there that wouldn't mind making nuyen hitting targets that won't fight back."

For the megas you're trying to dissuade teams from running against you - but you know they'll always be people will to run the risk of doing a run, no matter how dangerous. Thus no matter how many teams you kill, shadowrunners will still work for you because the nuyen is so sweet (plus other goods you can provide as payment). This is also completely ignoring that most runners (especially newer ones) will have no idea who they are working for.  The main flaw in your argument would be comparing it to the security teams on site. By your logic, no corp can defend their facilities, because it would lead to shadowrunner deaths, which in turn would (apparently) piss every megacorp off because you killed a worthless expandable asset (of which there are hundreds more).  Now a lot of the time its not cost effective to do this, but if a team causes enough trouble (lots of deaths, repeated break ins etc) then absolutely do you go after them, but doing so doesn't make you notorious."

Once tracked astrally expect riggers to be involved to cover both bases. Then you have the drones ping their sins. Now you have their fake sins for deckers to use. Find their homes and raid them for material and sympathetic links. Now they meet their mr johnson two hours later and the meet can be intereupted.  Or their fixer gets a counter offer for the x that was stolen if info gathering leads to contacts and to the fixer. Lots of stuff can go down.  More loss of life and more property damage the more likely the smackdown will come.  A pro run is unlikely to lead to this as they are obviously pros so that means more resources spent with less likelihood of success. A great run is when they don't even immediately know they were hit. So who are they going to retaliate?  Different corps have different reps and some don't forget.

Probably not.  But if every corp started doing it, or if one corp started doing it to everyone that hit them, it starts to become a problem.  Despite how it seems, Shadowrunners are not gutter punks.  They have a serious investment in skills and resources.  You can't just replace them by finding some gangers and throwing cash at them.

For the megas you're trying to dissuade teams from running against you - but you know they'll always be people will to run the risk of doing a run, no matter how dangerous.   No there won't...  The only reason the shadowrunning community even exists is because it benefits the corps.  They could crush it pretty easily simply by refusing to hire them and wearing the extra costs of doing everything in house.  They don't do that because it's expensive and risky.    Start wiping out shadowrunners and suddenly the only players are expensive, and one of the main reasons for using them is gone.

I'm talking about retaliatory strikes against teams that have got in and got out again.  You don't do that unless there is a good reason.  However, if they're right there destroying your assets, then of course you're going to take them out.  The good runners don't get in to all out gun fights, and good or bad, stopping them from stealing or destroying your assets takes immediate priority over any other situation.  It doesn't matter who sent them or why, you need to stop them.  However once they get out again, and no longer have your assets, the damage is already done.  That's when it becomes a waste of resources.  At that point, stopping or getting retaliations on the person who sent them is the strategic move."

It's hard to comment on this point without actual numbers, but I'll say that high turnover is still relative.

My suggestion:   HTR hits them in the night while they sleep, full gas grenade barrage, followed by a coordinated stick and shock strike for anyone with anything in place to defend against the gas.  Now your team has been arrested and gets moved to the local police precinct for processing, but they will get broken out. Either something hits them mid transit (unlikely really) or someone breaks them out of processing or jail itself.  This Johnson has heard about their rampaging problems and knows they're looking at life in prison or a death sentence. He knows this team is desperate and thus they're gonna work for free (or at least for him for free). If they let him get them out, then he starts them on a new campaign arc (can be a short one) but he wants them to follow certain rules to avoid getting put back in jail.   Now the team can refuse the job, in which case they need to reroll characters (and you can explain that to avoid the same fate they should restrict these bad actions), or they take it, in which case their new fake SINs (combined with facial surgery perhaps?) gives them a fresh start where they can avoid getting new attention on them by following the code of conduct"
Shadowrun,3dwlp1,felicidefangfan,3,Mon Jul 20 04:56:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I think that this might be a good way of doing it. Follow up question: what makes up a typical HTR team? Would it be like a mage, a couple of soldier-types (PR3-4?) and a decker/rigger. Or would it be worse?  And yeah, definitely will burn their sins if i can."
Shadowrun,3dwlp1,LC_HoTS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"For me the average HTR team consists of a squad of 8, as this way even with a couple of people slumped out in VR, you get 2-3 fireteams for flanking maneuvers and other small squad tactics.  The squad will always include the following roles: A mage, a decker, a leader [with the small unit tactics knowledge skill], a rigger and a dedicated marksman (who is also a sniper if required). The other team members will have good combat stats, the equivalent of street sams or combat adepts (likely they'll be a mix of those roles).    The mage will have a decent magic and spellcasting/summoning rating (magic 5-7, spellcasting/summoning 6-9 plus specializations). He'll likely also have a power focus (or multiple foci for the spell categories required) at force 2-4.  While on route he may astrally project to check out the site ahead of time, possibly even calling in bound spirits or summoning a fresh spirit to back up the on site security. As an experienced mage, he'll likely have a few more spells under his belt than the shadowrunner (15-20 perhaps) but don't define them in advance - instead draw from a set of useful ones (any combat spells [including direct, aoe and elemental], illusory spells, physical barrier, shape [material], detection spells, literally any spell that exists can be used as the situation demands). He may use spirits to take on a tank role and protect his team, or form an extra fireteam for flanking the shadowrunners. The decker will use one of the better decks (shiawase Cyber-5 or the Ares echo unlimited would be my choices, save either model of the fairlight deck for something even better than HTR, like a firewatch team). The Array (if you haven't chosen the ares echo unlimited with its set array) will be focused on attack and firewall (no need to be stealthy after all). The decker is either a demiGOD or acting with their approval so any actions against the shadowrunners will accumulate no OS. Page 76 and 77 of data trails have decent stats for the npc (use lesser demigod for HTR), but in case you don't own it - logic should be 5/6, with cerebral boosters augmenting that to (7)/(8), willpower should be 5, intuition 5, reaction 4/5. All decker related skills should be 6-9 (computer, cybercombat, hacking etc) and should have specializations. They will be running several programs to help with matrix combat (including an agent or 2 if they expect a lot of matrix resistance from the shadowrunners) and should have one of the modules from data trails (hardening or multidimensional coprocessor would be most useful). Like the mage, the decker will be getting into combat from a distance as they head to the site. If anyone is inside a host, expect the HTR decker to backup any security spiders, including using IC. If not (or perhaps if the spider has things under control) then the decker will instead focus on messing with the other runners equipment (ejecting clips, messing with cyberware, relocking doors behind the team, anything a normal decker would do). The rigger will likely be piloting the vehicle HTR are using, almost certainly an area roadmaster if driving (or rarely a rover model 2072 if speed is more important than armor), or an Ares dragon/Nissan Hound if taking a chopper. His attributes will be similar to the deckers, but with 5-7 in reaction thanks to augmentation (and a tad less in logic, but not much). Skills will be pilot (groundcraft/aircraft) 6-9 and gunnery 6-9, specializations in both. For equipment he'll have a control rig (rating 2 or 3) and any of the device rating 6 RCCs (mostly to maximise the number of slaved devices) he'll run matrix programs (just like the decker). In addition to the vehicle used to transport the team (and its guns) he'll be using an army of drones, several roto drones being the best choice (for the weapon versatility), but the C-D dalmatian is a good flying drone for combat, and the steel lynx is excellent for ground combat. He'll send flying drones ahead of the vehicle (likely the C-D dalmation as its faster than the choppers, but rotodrones can be sent ahead if using an ares roadmaster) to form a first wave of attack alongside any spirits and decker attacks. He'll directly control drones to boost their dice pool (they'll only have 9 dice [3 pilot and 6 program] without him) but will send group commands using the RCC. The drones will likely have multiple types of weapon (mostly assault rifles, but one or 2 might have a sniper rifle and 1 or 2 might have an assault cannon/grenade launcher) The leader will be the most experienced team member (use maximum stats for him to represent mook Lt. status). She'll likely have a decent leadership, in addition to the small unit tactics knowledge skill and will use both. Making the decker/rigger/high-initiative-score-member the leader will help her have more passes to use the small unit tactics in addition to her other skills. She may also have a Personal integrated tactical network (PI-Tac) of level 2/3. The dedicated marksman/sniper will either join the squad on going inside, in which case he'll be using a DMR/EBR (like the Cavalier Arms Crockett EBR, or the Onotari JP-K50) that lets him take long range high damage shots, whilst also allowing for burst fire against groups/opponents at closer range. Or he will set up in a nest in an overwatch role, perhaps overlooking the building's main exit or the freeway they're expected to escape down - in these cases he'll likely take a much much damaging rifle that lacks the clip size and burst fire of an EBR (with greater distance and time to aim, the extra damage and armor penetration is more useful) such as the Ranger Arms SM-5 or the Barret model 122. The other squad members will consist of various street samurai (and the occasional combat adept). The sams are more common because there's a lot more mundanes for the corps to upgrade with ware than there are adepts. Commonly they'll have high body, agility, reaction (and sometimes strength, more so if melee focused) thanks to augmentations and lots of training. Skills are likely firearms (including heavy weapons) in the 6-9 ratings (with specialisations), athletics group rating 6, perception of 6-9, sneaking of 5-8 (if involved in stealthy operations like night raids) and throwing 6-9. They'll use any decent assault rifle, shotgun, assault cannon, grenade launcher, or machine gun, as well as hand thrown grenades (both deadly and non-lethal like flashbangs and gas). Commonly they'll be wearing full body armor with a helmet and a full chemical seal (and any other upgrades you want), but tougher units might have security armor (light is essentially full body armor, so use medium and heavy) and the toughest units will have hardened mil-spec battle armor.    Any metatype can be HTR. The most common is human (we are the most common metatype after all), but you'll also get many orks (generally in the street sam role but don't stereotype!) thanks to their natural toughness. Elves and dwarves are less common (as they're not quite as numerous as the humans or orks) but still very useful (dwarves may not be as tough as an ork and comparatively have reduced reaction, but they can make up for it with increased willpower and natural thermographic vision, plus a better logic than an ork. Elves have no downsides and get bonuses to agility, making them more likely to take a marksman role than the other metatypes). Finally trolls are rare, but when they do show up they will be the biggest, and the scariest looking part of the HTR team (many a runner has dreked their pants at the sight of a heavily armored troll all chromed up and carrying a big ass machine gun calmly steps into the same room as them)."

Shadowrun,3dwlp1,Tyrhaynes,2,Mon Jul 20 07:41:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, depending on how mature the group is and what they can handle it would be a wakeup call.

Shadowrun,3dwlp1,insert_topical_pun,7,Mon Jul 20 18:31:18 2015 UTC,If any are mages and didn't wipe their astral signatures than someone knows it and probably have astral photography of it which can then be used for ritual sorcery. If they cost someone enough money or loss of face the mage could get an astral message warning them if another mage saw their astral form. This spell lets them send a short warning message and the spell can be used to track the mage via an astral link.  If they left blood or any hair or tissue anywhere it is now in x's hands and preserved for ritual use.  So someone is going to wake up to a prodigal area effect spell grounded into their aura.  Or you make a preparation that is targeted just for them on a door handle or the package they need to pickup.  All their contacts are going to be watched or suborned. Word on the street will be that they're scorched.  Their SINS will be known. Their matrix habits watched.   Anonymity is key to survival.
Shadowrun,3dwlp1,insert_topical_pun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:47:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. We don't have any mages unfortunately, I am working on getting more players but we only have three so far, a street sam, a decker, and a sniper/stealth covert ops type player.   I like the suggestion for the contacts and the matrix stuff."
Shadowrun,3dwlp1,Celondon,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"That makes them scarily vulnerable with no astral watch. Spirits may even now be tracking there every move. Maybe they have behaving so badly because of liberal use of manipulation and influence spells and powers. Maybe a free shadow spirit has been using them to achieve its goals and may be visiting to thank the pc's for their participation so it can watch them squirm. After all it could've been feeding on the violence, despair, and misery in their wake. Make sure for it to cast an illusion spell with a little girl crying about where her mommy is and why the boogeyman won't leave her alone...the husband is drinking in the background despairing about how they will pay the bills without that second income.  After all it wants to gloat and it wants the players to freak out. It knows all their hideouts and friends. It has already visited them and had good long talks with any family it could find. It feeds on their terror. Maybe after they can no longer provide entertainment the sister of the runner can be a diverting time."

Send them to gain access. When they pull it up, it's their own files listing various amounts of surveillance in place and plans to execute takedowns some night this week. Any SINs used previous to now are 2 or 3 ratings lower (behind the scenes) for being on watch lists and trigger a response team when detected. If they beat feet and lay low, their mugs end up all over the news vids and contacts with loyalty 3 or lower will probably turn them in if contacted as well.   If you want to go hardcore Shadowrun: as posted above, midnight HRT visit and let the dice fall where they may.

They'll definitely face full security checks (SIN's, licenses, biometrics matched v. database, etc.) and questioning at the local police station, if not outright arrest and/or a SWAT team.

Shadowrun,3dwlp1,marwynn,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"Your players want pink mohawk style high-action.  Why don't you just give them runs full of action?  Give them the bad-ass, public rep they really want by having Johnsons only contact them when they want something done very loud.  SR is full of these kinds of runs.  There's no reason to punish them for what they like.  Lockdown is a one-way ticket to non-stop, ""28 Days Later,"" zombie-murder action that you literally can't get away from.  That's just an example, but there are many others.  But, make sure the combats are hard.  I mean, those who live by the sword die by the sword.  Right?"
Shadowrun,3dwlp1,Zemalac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"The thing is they say they want a combination of pink mohawk and black trenchcoat. My problem isn't with them doing pink mohawk, but it is the fact that they don't even try to protect their identities/ play slightly smartly. They've lucked out on a few combats that they really shouldn't have survived, and that has made them even more careless. Pink mohawk is fine and fun, but I want to put a little fear back into them."

Shadowrun,3dwvnn,RossTheRed,7,Mon Jul 20 05:08:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly it sounds like your GM just needs more experience. The first thing you should do is sit down with him and tell him what you enjoy and why you want to play. Do you want more focus on combat? Tell him. Want less time spent doing legwork and speaking to contacts? Tell him. Figure out exactly what is bothering you and iron out the details. A mature conversation should resolve these problems.  I think your character looks pretty good. Keep focusing on covert ops style stuff and ask your GM to set up some security measures for you to attempt to bypass. Even if there is someone with similar skills you can do teamwork tests for a lot of stuff.  If the GM is upset with your contacts he should give you more, that's his job and it seems like you have enough already anyway. I think the best way to design a session is to organize it by making a list of scenes and figuring out what important things need to happen in them. Then try to only spend so much time on each scene and tailor the length based on how engaged the players are. Tell that to your GM. It sounds like he's dragging it out way too much.  It's better to have a solid 4 hour session than a boring 10 hour one. I'd say after 2 to 3 hours at most the group should be on a run in most sessions. Either that or doing something legitimately interesting for the whole group.   Fixer calls Meet Mr. Johnson for a job Legwork + buy anything needed Go on the run Get paid   Mix in social scenes as needed. I think for you to be satisfied your GM needs to do 1 to 2 runs per session and more emphasis needs to be put on B&E and combat. You could also work on your Intimidation skill and do the dirty work the Elf might not want to do. You would get some social modifiers too because you are fearsome.  Bottom line: Talk to your GM, tell him what you want and how you will have the most fun, get your GM to pace his action a lot better and keep it fast and exciting. He has to cut scenes short if the game is getting slow and move on to something exciting. He needs more experience but it's your job to help him learn.   Hope that helps a bit."
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,ChromeEagle,5,Mon Jul 20 09:07:56 2015 UTC,One more tip. Try to encourage your group to minimize the amount of time spent goofing around and making jokes. It can be fun but it kills immersion and eats up a LOT of times. Hours can pass quickly doing that and it can really drown a session.
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,ChromeEagle,3,Mon Jul 20 09:10:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, time spent goofing is arguably my biggest grievance here. I love dicking around but at the same time I know that we almost always run late, and try to keep it going whenever I get into things but I feel so bossy doing that."
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,ChromeEagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:56:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a very fine line. On one hand you want to have fun with your friends and screw around but on the other hand you get to do that every other time you hang out and the general goal is supposed to be role playing. Role playing eats up a shitload of time so you do need to be fairly focused.  I think that's why the idea of promoting immersion is a good idea. Really being able to envision what's going on in the game world and making it feel real is an important skill. If everyone is screwing around you won't reach that level or immersion. But if people take it seriously and refrain from saying anything out of character you can not only enjoy the game on a deeper level but have way more fun.  That's the true way to get the most out of the hobby imo. Again, everyone wants to screw around but imo the cost isn't worth it."
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,ChromeEagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:09:37 2015 UTC,"I don't want him to like tailor make the adventure for us/me, just intersperce the spotlight I guess. It feels weird complaining when I get so much but again it's like waiting forever to get to it, even if I have it for a while, kinda sours the whole bit.  I guess maybe I just need to talk with him to let him know that 'Hey man, I could use some help reigning the rest of the players in.' when the goofing around gets to be too much."
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,CitizenJoseph,3,Mon Jul 20 15:04:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is good idea. My group had huge problems with this. We're all around 30 now so we've matured a lot but back when we were 15 it would sometimes take over 3 hours before people would stop screwing around on an extreme level. Even while we were around 25 the joking was a distraction but not TOO bad. Now I try to focus on not joking at all and try to go full immersion. It can get pretty intense sometimes when EVERYONE is 100% into character, raising their voice, expressing sadness or anger, brutality, etc. In a recent campaign in a different game I played a large barbarian type character who had brain damage from an injury and he was fairly child-like because of it and spoke very poorly with limited vocabulary and an odd tone of voice. I stayed in character the entire campaign and it took a lot of focus to do that for me but it was very memorable.   If you could somehow get your group to go more down the path of immersion you would have a better time I think. You gotta put your foot down a bit when the game involves too much screwing around."
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,Tyrhaynes,5,Mon Jul 20 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"Yea.... I feel you man. Pacing is hard in shadowrun, it takes forever and a half. And, for the record, that vampire thing is shitty DMing, that should have worked flawlessly BECAUSE of the scenario and your badge (granted I probably would have made you roll if one of them was lying but only if one was actually bitten).  As for making things better.... we tried to come up with plans that used people simultaneously. Had to break into a place so we broke into the building a few blocks away. Yhe sam cleared the building and swept floor by floor and yhen did physical surveillance with the decker his eyes and ears. The mage went to work laying out a silence spell on every wall and such. The demolitions guy (a different sam) went about setting up shaped charges to blow a hole through the floor into the basement of the building we really needed into. everyone was engaged and everyone was useful.  Further, a low charisma means you aren't charming and that you cant falsely manipulate people - that big fucking orc in your face with a gun is independently scary from how well he can string together a scary one-liner."
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,ozurr,2,Mon Jul 20 06:36:31 2015 UTC,"We hold off on doing that because most of the time there's just no back up for people. Most of the runs we go on have strict timers (48 hours, 24 to get your bonus. 24 hours. 1 hour), and the one that was very free form was just really Matrix heavy, and spent most of it focusing one guy. Also they're the kind of jobs were if you send one guy in and they get caught they die. It's been very hard, but we try to make sure that everyone is as together/safe as possible. This usually results in the Rigger waiting around in the van (in fact tonight was his first adventure in meatspace, he was scared shitless by a Vampire Troll in leather)."
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,CitizenJoseph,4,Mon Jul 20 07:03:26 2015 UTC,"This is why I've suggested skipping the Johnson meeting.  It is a spotlight stealer and if someone gets bored they just chuck a grenade.  The single point of failure is the GM.  Nobody is playing with each other, they are all just playing with the GM.  You need to figure out a way to play the game without GM input/adjudication.  That will go on while the special snowflakes are doing their own stuff with the GM."
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:38:35 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I mean I thought if anything I was the special snowflake. I just want the damn team working together.

Shadowrun,3dwvnn,felicidefangfan,3,Mon Jul 20 14:52:03 2015 UTC,Sounds like your GM is not handling time management well. Everyone needs time to shine. Does the GM ask you what your character is doing while x and y are off doing their thing?
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,LC_HoTS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:32:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, he does a lot of the time, although I don't blame our GM for much of anything. I know it's a tough spot to be in. When I DM'd I always made it a point to remind people 'This game is as fun as you make it for each other.' I think our GM takes a similar approach. It's just that sometimes, I don't know, it feels a bit too hands free. I'll go with tonight since that's what's freshest. We get a call saying we have to be in the Barrens in an hour and that shit's super important. So we get patched into a group call with the other runners (Rigger and I are roommates, other two were new PC's for regular players). We go through our knowledge checks, get some good stuff, general info, and then we start going through contacts, and somehow, in that span of 20 in game minutes getting ready, like, 3 damn hours went by. I mean we got there at 1pm, the last guy showed up at 2ish and joined right at the end of the Fixer call, so between 2 and 5 how the hell did we spend that much time. Rigger and I didn't have any extremely relevant contacts. The contacts we did try didn't pick up. GM was taking turns (So A is calling X contact, B is calling Y, C is calling Z, etc). So it goes I call, no answer, move to next guy, call, Roleplay and regular information, next guy, calls and lots of information, my turn, call, no answer, leave message. Rinse repeat.   And we're in a rush so it's not like we even have time to do the normal scouting aside from what we can Matrix search on the way there. Finally we get there, explore a bit, and action starts. But again, and I can't even say I was fully aware of this poor Rigger hasn't got jack squat to do as we head into the sewers ( Doberman drones can barely fit down there, 13 something k nuyen Rotodrone destroyed in the first combat roll on the session).  I don't know if maybe it's just a bad luck string that the missions that I end up feeling salty about are also the ones lll-suited for our characters and also the ones were everyone else is there. I mean when I was a Face and useless (didn't quite realize how useful Leadership was at the time), I didn't feel too shitty about not helping out in the combat department, but now that I can't seem to help in the roleplay, intelligence gathering I just feel deflated I guess.   I swear, I don't ever bitch this much about Tabletops. Maybe at most when someone is trying to justify that Fighter/Wizard/Druid/Cleric are a equal and well-balanced class but that's about it."
Shadowrun,3dwvnn,D_Keller,3,Mon Jul 20 06:07:21 2015 UTC,"The contacts we did try didn't pick up.    Hmm.  This right here I don't like.   So it goes I call, no answer, move to next guy, call, Roleplay and regular information, next guy, calls and lots of information, my turn, call, no answer, leave message. Rinse repeat.    This right here I really don't like.    You don't have a problem with the game.  You have a problem with the GM.  You're getting straight blocked from contributing to the team, and it seems like when you can contribute the GM is coming down hard.  I'd ask the GM what their problem is with you and see if you can get an answer.  Some generalist information stuff to justify my response of ""ask the GM why he's being such a jerkass"" -   In a home-game setting it isn't as much the team's job to bring something to the table as it is the GM to craft a job where everyone is going to be useful.  As someone who is going to be useful if/when the shooting starts, your legwork should be providing meatspace security solutions for your squishier teammates.    Now, having looked at your sheet I'm somewhat baffled that you've got two fixers with enough Connection to get any information you need yet you're being lambasted because your contacts are 'never there'.  A fixer is an information broker as well as a job broker, and the connection ratings you've got mean there's one who would at least call you right back, if not pick up the first time.  That the GM's consistently gone ""nope nobody's calling you back but Frank the Elfmage rolled his connection 2 street dealer and uncovered a massive security plan to get you in without a shot fired"" is suspect. Basically -   the missions that I end up feeling salty about are also the ones lll-suited for our characters   should not be happening in a home game.  Full stop.  Either the GM can't handle the players he's got and you keep getting the short straw, or the GM has an issue with you and the Rigger and is being passive-aggressive.    In the end, judging by the rant and the additional rants you've posted as responses - maybe it is time to look somewhere else, or at least confront the GM so you can clear the air.  If you're not having fun with this game, find another SR game lest you give up on SR entirely.  That would suck."

In your downtime get more contacts,  start doing favours for people (full runs or mini runs) and gain them as contacts. During the legwork do some physical recon,  your ok sneaking combined with the rigger (why does he have no fly spies?) should be getting into places and checking them out/staking them out   Absolutely do they question you,  you're in full blown panic mode and someone you've never seen before suddenly stays giving orders? Now granted you should have huge dice pool modifiers in your favour,  but you still need that etiquette check to know what you're meant to be doing in that scenario (for example are you demanding info that only the manager will have? That might look suspicious to the wage slave)  Your gm might need to remove this time limit,  if you're falling run after run because he's encouraging you to rush,.

Shadowrun,3dv2su,maullido,5,Mon Jul 20 00:04:49 2015 UTC,"Just comparing the base games (SR:R and Genesis) the Genesis version wins every time.  When you stop and think about the technical limitations of fitting the game onto the Genesis cartridge it's not even a contest any more.    One was written in assembly by ninjas.  The other was written in C#(unity) by competent programmers.  EDIT: Matrix combat has still never been better than the Genesis game.  EDIT2: I mean no disrespect to C# coders, I was one for ~8 years; but the fact of the matter is that it's a whole different level of complexity."

No other game has gotten the feel of the matrix right.

Still, anyone scanning this that has only played the SNES version... Get a copy of the Sega one for comparison.

Shadowrun,3dv2su,zourn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:30:58 2015 UTC,"Different games made by different companies under the same title was quite common in that era of video games. You wanted a game to be on multiple platforms, but the devs you wanted to use only knew one platform, so you contracted other companies to create the games on other consoles. With little to no communication between companies, you ended up with very different games that still followed to the brief given by the owner of the IP.  It still happens to a degree in the modern day, albeit for different reasons. Many cross-platform games have recreated levels that might differ from other consoles quite a lot (as was the case quite often during the transitional period for the PS2 after the PS3 came out), or games that still differ completely due to different input methods (DS and Wii games see this quite often, due to their different input controls)."
Shadowrun,3dv2su,maullido,2,Mon Jul 20 03:37:49 2015 UTC,"I don't have a definite answer either...but...doing some reading between the lines about both games and their history, some conjecture could probably based upon how widespread both games were when they were first released. As whether or not that would be a good factor into how well it sunk into everybody's brain as ""canon"", or not?  Shadowrun for Genesis apparently was a North American only release, and I know whenever I look on eBay, it's often listed as 'Rare' and commands a fair price for a Genesis cart (25-50 cart only, 50-100+ in varying conditions w/ box+manual).   Shadowrun for SNES got releases in North America, Japan, and Europe. More people would probably remember this game better, and there seem to be more hard copies floating around, prices tend to be lower and more copies are CIB.  See also, the classic 1990's argument: ""If there's a SNES or Genesis version, which one would a gamer choose- the technically 'inferior' Genesis version, or the 'superior' SNES version?"" (I owned a Genesis growing up, so, I just ignored this argument, ha ha...)

It was the first exposure to the world of SR.   The look, feel, and details of the Genesis version really drew me into the world of SR. It has been one of the most immersive games I have played for a console/PC. And oddly enough, I wasn't even that worried about the story until the very end. I was much more interested in learning more about the world - stealing data from corps to sell, buying cool gear, sneaking through corp buildings to open all those safes, hoping those contacts were telling the truth about the effectiveness of corp badges and maglock keys. Those were some of the best moments in the game and to me really outshined the main story."

It seems very plausible (especially considering my other lost love, Firefly...) that if one company owns just enough of a jointly-owned product, then the other company has to leave it behind if they stop working together.

Shadowrun,3dv2su,EricKei,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that the Genesis version is perceived as a lower quality game overall compared to the SNES version from a game play point of view, even though it has the better relation to the actual game mechanics at the time.  Otherwise, things are subjectively better in one than the other.  Hear me out on this:   The SNES graphics read better than the Genesis version.  You saw your character more clearly (isometric versus top down), your ability to shoot and cast spells was more clearly defined (put the cursor thingy over the bad guy), there was a better contrast to the world in general that drew you in but separated everything well from each other (Genesis was mostly the same pallet in each area, sometimes clashing with your character). Sound design was better in the SNES version.  The music feels stronger and thematic, no tinny sounds when shooting, casting spells, or decking. The story is cleaner in the SNES version.  There's a mysterious ""You awake in a morgue with amnesia"" hook and almost immediately you're set upon by hit men and gangers and go through a somewhat branching story that leads you to a pretty epic fight at the end.  The Genesis version has a somewhat disjointed story by comparison.  Sure you're here to find out what happened to your brother, but the story progress is often few and far between, and sometimes is entirely randomly you'll stumble upon the next segment.  Like, literally, a run will show up that is the next part of the story seemingly at random.  But besides side missions (which you almost need to do to survive) there's no branches in the story at all.  It's go here, do this thing, pick up on what you're supposed to do next from what you just did. Mechanically, the SNES version is nothing like the base game.  The only semblance is karma, and the names of things in game (assault cannons, manaballs, etc.).  This extended to every aspect, including the lackluster matrix stuff.  The Genesis version however is a real-time adapted version of the base rules, even down to the L/M/S/D damage codes (well, mostly).  Ammo was even finite, and spells did drain to you if you over cast.  In my mind, this makes the Genesis version superior by a large margin, but many people didn't like it for that. Lastly it's the whole console war thing.  The SNES was just a stronger contender in the end.  The SNES sold 20 million more units world wide.  The games were (mostly) better (see Square's offerings as a primary example).  There was more innovation in the cartridges after the console's release as well which Sega never responded to (mode 7 graphics which provided, at the time, ground breaking 3D).   Don't get me wrong, both games are good.  I just more vividly remember the SNES Shadowrun and its story compared to the Genesis version.  I've finished both twice, and while the Genesis version has the mechanics I loved and felt better to me as a result in the moment to moment, the game itself devolves into a grind of ""go to place, extract person, report successful run"" or ""hack matrix system, download all the pay data, complete objective, report successful run and sell pay data"" until you can survive the next story mission, or until you stumble into the next step of the story randomly.  The SNES version more or less didn't have that grind.  You could grind, but you didn't need to."
Shadowrun,3dwh9h,codaa27,9,Mon Jul 20 02:48:38 2015 UTC,"Firstly I would say that the main appeal of a shadowrunner is that they are both deniable and expendable. If they get caught they probably don't even know who hired them, and thus no evidence links back to you (the hiring megacorp). Additionally they take almost no resources to use - instead of spending 10s of millions of nuyen (across training, equipment, salaries, and danger pay) that a a black ops team costs, you instead spend a few 10s of thousands to hire a team that can't then be linked back to you. You'd have to go through thousands of shadowrunner teams to make up the equivalent cost of a spec ops team. The corporate court has heavy fines for both corporate espionage and corporate warfare. The standard is that any infarction must be punished severely, thus the cost of fines severely outweighs the cost of a homegrown spec ops team (for illegal operations only of course). There is a massive underground economy, remember that this is a dystopian future where the corps literally care for nothing but more profit and power (often through profit). The SINless represent a very minor area to make money (as they have no nuyen to spend) but there is still profit to make and that matters. So the corps set up a scenario where they occasionally ""lose"" a shipment of something outdated (last years cyberware models or firearms) to a syndicate or some other organised crime group in exchange for off the books nuyen. Equally they provide some big credsticks worth of ""business expenses"" to syndicates in exchange for carrying out some of the off the books work they need doing. The syndicates (mafia, yakuza, triads, vory etc) are the big fish in the underworld. You do get grooming of teams! Many a time has a Johnson hired a group for a series of runs designed to test their skills and knowledge, in order to prep them (or at least be sure they're ready) for an ultimate goal! Additionally the corp might provide equipment as part of the payment, further enhancing this asset. Larger groups are dangerous to the corps and as such they will potentially try to break up any such ""guilds"", while at the same time larger groups are easier to track, putting the shadowrunners themselves at risk (making many distrustful of such alliances). You do get informal groups however, multiple teams who know the same fixer, fixers who team up to expand the number of assets they can lease out etc.  Some corps would hire a particularly skillful individual, but only if having them on a permanent and traceable payroll exceeds their usefulness as an independent and deniable asset. For the most part you rarely need a super decker, so why have them on permanent payroll (expensive) and at the same time make them directly link-able to you (you provide this money regularly which means it can be tracked)?"

They don't exist for the system, there is no official resources for them. Nowhere to complain about a rotten slumlord kicking them out. No city official to make sure electricity is consistent and water is drinkable. No cops to call when their car gets burned. But they are there, no one know exactly how many (since they don't fill out the census). They need food. They need shelter, clothes... They need security.  Now the way I play I tend to have a few levels of street gangs. Some are hostile (iw : Halloweeners) some are not. Depending on how much you can pay them they'll stop other nuisances for touching your stuff. If you wear the right bandana/tag/colors down the street no one will mug you.  I tend to layer them, smaller groups (couple of kids ""owning"" that warehouse) reporting to larger ones, eventually reporting to the organised crime syndicates. That way I can get Security and base necessity covered (who drives the truck into that neighborhood to refill the nutrisoy?).  Then I tend to layers the Runners and their micro-cosmos above that. They pump money into the shadow world, getting paid from the corps in denomination of their choice... They also need shelter, for their stuff not to be touched when they are on a run. They need medical attention and sometimes cyber implants, so they finance the street clinics with big ticket items. This allows the docs to actually run the clinics as dispensaries for the SINless. They buy guns/ammo/gear from various fixers and fence, so the money gets fueled back to the organised crime syndicates (for the most part) which then trickles down to the gangs. They eat food. They have bars and dives (some are quite runner exclusive). Those places hire people. And since they don't want the  Corps' control they tend to hire the local SINless. Who can then buy food and security....  Basically making it a totally parallel economy where the runners are the Apex predators (really, you're going to try and mug the fully armed street sam on his way to the clinic to visit his wounded team mate?) and money mills.  I don't make the runners really band together because trust is a pretty expensive commodity. But I make Street Rep count. An other runner team was hired to stop you by a competing Johnson? Life sucks but it's business. You went out of your way to kill them? Ok, no one really wants to associate with you. You sold another runner team to the authorities for any reason? The community turns against you. No one wants your money, you're poison. You don't have security anymore. You gear can get messed with.

In most cases, your AR filters will be set to condense Icons in view. So if a person has a Commlink, mileage tracking shoes, body temperature tracking underwear, sweat tracking socks, rain detecting jacket... You would probably just see the Commlink Icon with a little (+) or something next to it. The other devices aren't ""Hidden"" or anything, just that the default filters usually suppress stupid stuff like that.  However, you can set it to show whatever you like. Mall cops may want to make sure that any kinds of dangerous items, like guns and cybernetics will always stand out. So even at a distance, those Icons would be apparent to him. But there aren't digital threads tracing them back to their Master.  Now what does happen... is if you land a Mark onto the Slave, you will also score a Mark onto the Master. At which point, you can always locate your Marks on the Grid. So you'd land a Mark on the gun / shoes / whatever, and then you'd be able to locate the Commlink they were Slaved to, even if it were back at home in their sock drawer. Not that you'd know it was in the sock drawer (unless you used Trace Icon to get the real world location)."

Just b/c he's got grief with FasterJacker doesn't mean he automatically knows all his friends' Personas as well. And even if he knew of them somehow, doesn't mean he would instantly spot them online whenever and wherever. Remember, if it were that easy to watch for users, GOD could crush hackers the moment they log in too. But for the sake of the story...  Without any warning, there's no reason why he would be on Full Defense. Since it's basically a surprise attack.  Either use of Edge is perfectly reasonable, since Edge is pretty much Luck / the Force coming to your rescue. So either he was lucky in defending himself, or luckily he pulled through the brain surgery.  Although TrollTroll is going to need a LOT of dice if he's planning on killing someone with a single shot. Data Spiking involves rolling Cybercombat + Logic [Attack] vs Intuition + Firewall. So right there, Face gets to try and avoid the damage with his Intuition and the Firewall of the device. Since you mention he loaded an Agent, that means he must be using a Cyberdeck. Almost a shame, since Commlinks have cheaper yet stronger Firewalls, if all you wanted was to Google some information.  If Face happens to lose the roll, the damage from the Data Spike is only going to be TrollTroll's Attack rating + the net hits from the check. He doesn't get the extra Mark damage, since there were no Marks in place ahead of time (this was a surprise attack after all). So unless TrollTroll boosted his Attack way up there, it may not be so bad.  Now that you've determined how much damage TrollTroll is doing (both in Matrix damage to the Deck and in BFB to Face), Face gets to soak the BFB by rolling Willpower + Firewall. Again, it would have been handy to use a higher Firewall Commlink instead. Regardless, whatever damage carries through will indeed be Physical b/c Face was Hot-Sim. However, there is every chance it won't be an instant kill. Even if it were Forked into hitting twice, you have to resolve each Data Spike separately, so one may hit and the other may miss. Also... some GMs would argue that Fork says ""on two targets"" and say you can't target the same person both times. It's the same reason they argue you can't use Multiple Attack Free Action to shoot the same person several times, it also says ""two targets""."
Shadowrun,3dvmom,ozurr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:37:53 2015 UTC,"Its a commlink. There's one in DT that has a rating 3(I think) Agent built into it.  Fork should work fine, it's two seperate personas.  One hit will only be lethal if he's also rolling link lock. Hitting both the Agent and Face will very often be lethal, because it will almost always brick his link, and taking 6P after taking 1-5P twice is basically done city."
Shadowrun,3dvmom,marcus_gideon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:54:19 2015 UTC,"Forking between the Agent and the Persona will deal quite a lot of Matrix damage to the Deck / Comm. But it will only apply the Biofeedback once. You can't deal BFB to the Agent, and no it won't transfer over to the Persona instead.

Shadowrun,3dvmom,ElevatedUser,2,Mon Jul 20 04:39:56 2015 UTC,"Uh. You sure?   Whenever a slaved device is called on to make a defense test, it uses either its own or its master’s rating for each rating in the test. For example, if your slaved smartgun is the target of a hacker’s Brute Force action, it would use your Willpower or its Device Rating, and its Firewall or your commlink’s, whichever is higher in each instance.""   In that text, ""you"", refers to the person slaving. So you would use the devices device rating, or the ""slavers"" willpower. So it sure sounds like it's supposed to be more than just firewall."
Shadowrun,3dvmom,helionwulf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:26:03 2015 UTC,"""You"" refers to the owner of the device in question. Remember, the PAN rules are written from the perspective of a single person slaving devices to his commlink.  The Willpower vs DR part isn't actually part of slaving; that's just the normal rules for defense (you use either your - the device owner's - stat or the item's DR when an item of yours is attacked).  What slaving does is the second part. You get to use the master's (the commlink, or the decker's deck) matrix attributes for defense tests. That's not just firewall - it's attack, sleaze and DP as well - although it's mostly firewall, since the others aren't used much.  But the point is, that's all it does. Slaving just gives your slaved devices higher effective matrix attributes for defense tests. That helps, but that's all you get, and it's usually just 3-4 points extra. Your decker doesn't get to interrupt attacks, or actively defend you in any way.  (Mind you, that means that slaving to decks is generally not worth it, except if you're running silently - after all, you can get a decent firewall, probably better then your decker's, fairly easily)."

Shadowrun,3dw9h5,Mandrilly,4,Mon Jul 20 01:38:01 2015 UTC,"There are no mixed race offspring. Not officially. You can have or gain damaged metagenetics, which allow you to express features of one race while being another, but that's not the same thing.  Metagenes aren't just dormant or active, they're essentially walled off behind common genes. The only way to interact with them as a geneticist is to alter the genes they're tied to, and even when you activate the correct metagenes, they only express in certain groupings. (ie; metatypes & metavariants)  IIRC, Target: Wastelands has some info on the subject. I remember finding reference in the wiki, but I'm not sure where. If you dig through the first three editions of core books, there's a surprising amount of info there, too.   Does one parent win out, are some metatypes dominant, or is it random?   Goblinoid races are dominant with humans, (hence the perjorative ""breeders"") but it is possible to be born human to goblinoid parent(s) - in which case you have something like a 1/20 chance of not goblinising during puberty.   Are there any rough demographics tables, at least for the UCAS area?   http://www.shadowrun.com/forums/discussion/36807/racial-demographics-in-sr   Outside of the wiki, is there a good, searchable source for setting questions?   The books."
Shadowrun,3dw9h5,BitRunr,2,Mon Jul 20 02:07:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think Shadowruns has any basis on real world genetics whatsoever, one of the few things I remember is that if both parents are elves there's a 25% chance of the child being human, and that the Ork gestation cycle is way shorter, 4 months IIRC, so I believe they might only be able to give birth to ork children as that's the only metatype adapted to the different development cycle.  Other than that I don't think there's any official info, I assume that there's always a chance for the offspring to be human as they are still the most predominant race."
Shadowrun,3dw9h5,Trathos,2,Mon Jul 20 02:11:11 2015 UTC,"Metatypes are not entirely based on genetics. Background mana and its influence on genes is largely the cause for metatypes of humanity existing. As mana levels start to rise, creatues that barely resemble the basic human they share a species with start to exist.  This is why shadowrun has no halfbreeds - mana shaped expression of genes leads to you being entirely one or the other metatype, and even how a baby can be a completely different metatype to both parents (2 orks can give birth to a dwarf, or a troll and a human can give birth to an elf, just very rarely).  UTE and Goblinization were one time events, UTE was the name given to when mana levels were sufficient for human babies to start resembling elves and dwarves, whilst goblinization is the name given to when mana levels were sufficient for people going through puberty to suddenly change into the ""goblinoid"" races, nowadays you are simply born an ork or a troll (or dwarf, elf, or human).  In short: 2 of the same species are almost certain to give birth to the same species, whilst parents of 2 different metatypes will likely express one of the two. But you can actually be anything at all. And then there's changelings who do get random genes at puberty thanks to random spikes in the background mana count."
Shadowrun,3dw9h5,felicidefangfan,5,Mon Jul 20 03:56:17 2015 UTC,There are still orks and trolls that goblinize during puberty and they can have human or ork or troll parents.  If they goblinize they have normal human lifespans. Orks have litters.  I believe the sixth world almanac has demographics. Humans are dominant with orks in second and growing fast because they often have litters.  An elf and an human could have elf and human children. If both parents had recessive ork metagenes than a human child could goblinize at puberty. Elves and dwarves don't goblinize they are born that way.  Many changelings are those born with some of the traits of another type of metahuman. They might have lowlight vision for example but not enough to goblinize even with the mana spike during the year of the comet.

Shadowrun,3dw9h5,sb_747,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:56:35 2015 UTC,A whole bunch of rare and one off stuff exists but the basic rules for metatypes are pretty simple.   All metahumans can have offspring together and they have a chance to be either metatype of the parents or a human.   A human born to a troll or ork parent has a small chance to goblinize at puberty.   Human couples can have children of any metatype but at this point in time they are most likely to give birth to other humans

If the attack is biofeedback(P or S)than the blowback is also biofeedback.   Don't kill yourself because the Gnome has 16 dice and spends an edge to reroll.

Shadowrun,3duyvt,OLStefan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly what's being questioned here.   Core pg 245, Biofeedback  This program also applies to damage caused by failed Attack actions against you.   So if someone Attacks you and fails, and you have Biofeedback running at the time, then the damage that reverberates back at them will be Biofeedback.  However, it doesn't expressly say (anywhere I know of) that if you're attempting to inflict BFB damage and you fail, that it will reverberate as BFB back. Clearly it depends whether the target was capable of generating BFB. So in most cases, the failed damage will just be Matrix."
Shadowrun,3duyvt,marcus_gideon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:24:01 2015 UTC,"What I wnated to know was where its mentioned that a failed Biofeedback Attack causes Biofeedback Damage to me.  The other thing was that against IC no damage will be thrown back to me, I can't find any mention of this either."
Shadowrun,3duyvt,OLStefan,2,Mon Jul 20 08:34:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing anything that specifically says your BFB attack rebounds back as BFB still. It does say if you attack someone and they have BFB, they'll lace the rebound with BFB themselves.   IC would rebound like any other Persona. I think Pink was thinking that you can't deal damage directly to a Host. But each IC has their own damage track. They can be bricked."

Shadowrun,3duyvt,OLStefan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's entirely the case.   ... your target's security software rejects your code, corrupting it and sending it back where it came from.   Since they aren't sending your data back, but rather a corrupted version...  If you sent ordinary data, and they had BFB running, their corrupted version will do BFB (according to BFB, Core pg 245).  If you sent BFB data, I suspect their corruption would strip the effectiveness off. Unless they too had BFB when the re-packaged the data.  So personally, I'd say if you sent BFB and it rebounded off an ordinary target, it would come back as ordinary Matrix damage."

Shadowrun,3dtth2,Allarionn,2,Sun Jul 19 13:56:34 2015 UTC,"The simple way to do it without nerfing mages is to use standard priority numbers but Sum To 8 (or 7 if really low). This will still allow a Street Sam to sacrifice everything to get high resources, and therefor cyber they need to be functional in their role, without needing to implement other nerfs.   If you limit people to 25k starting funds, everyone will go Adept instead of Sam or mundane, because even at low magic they are still more functional in combat.  Sum To 8 or 7 with normal priority levels of cash magic and skills will still drastically limit all classes without punishing one archetype more than any others. The only other change I'd make is set an availability limit at 10 (much more limiting than it seems because a lot of staples are at 12) instead of the normal 12, and make all F items not available at CharGen.  Using this method you could still see Deckers, albeit very limited starting deckers, because the 25k limit would completely remove the possibility of a decker playing, period."

You might want to take more in Counterspelling, you only get to use the ""skill"" number of dice to counterspell, not skill+magic so right now you'd only get 3.  Optimization tips: Since you took elf, for karma efficiency you really want to pump Agility and/or Charisma - usually people make Charisma tradition mages, then you can dump Logic.   It's kind of tempting to drop Body to 1 and use the points for Cha/Agi and then use karma to raise it back to 3.  That's 25 points of karma spent, but raising say Cha from 4-6 is worth 55.  From 6-8 is worth 75...  If you're not going to use the increased stats of Elf metatype,  if you went Human you'd be able to drop Metatype to D and raise Skills to C.  If your plan is to raise stats during the campaign good luck, as you see they're expensive.  Generally you want Rea and Int as high as possible, that's your Defense Pool and also Initiative base.  Yea using karma now or soon after chargen to get Str from 1-2 would be handy, 1 str is not ""crippled"" but it's a definite weakness.  Another good use for karma is Qualities - Focused Concentration is damn nice,  you can use it to remove the -2 penalty from sustaining 1 spell at a time.   Cast the spell with reagents to get the force down to the level of your Focused Concentration (few can afford to buy Focused Concentration 6) and still keep the hits.  A level 1 fake SIN isn't gonna last long under any kind of scrutiny.

Shadowrun,3dtfi1,Tyrhaynes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"Ignore everything that follows unless you are using 5th, leaving for posterity but it is irrelevant to OP's edition.   Noticing magic is a Simple Perception + Intuition [Mental] Test with a threshold equal to the Skill Rating of the being performing it minus the Force of the magic, or 6 – Force if there’s no skill involved (minimum 1 in either case)  SR5 Core pg. 280   What follows is simply how I run given my knowledge of the rules, I don't claim it to be the one true way, and other tables will handle it differently.   That said, when I GM, I allow anyone affected by magic to make the test when they are first affected, any time something drastic happens if under the effects of a sustained spell, and any time they directly witness a magical act whether or not it affects them.  In practice this means that in most situations a mage can cast force 1 spells without risk of the public noticing, because most anyone under pro rating 4 has a mental limit of 4, and this cannot hope to have enough hits to meet the threshold 5 test. Anything higher than that gets trickier to use without being noticed.  I gauge the reaction to the awareness of magic by the net hits achieved. 1 net hit, they may be vaguely aware that there's mojo brewing, but may not necessarily realize they are under the effect of a control thoughts spell or who is casting it. This is enough for any corp security to call in suspicious activity immediately. 4 net hits would mean they definitely know who is casting if they can see the caster, and they can tell what is being magically affected. They'd still need to perform other checks to resist the effects and/or determine what sort of spell they're dealing with, however.  Using mind probe as an example, if you were to use it on someone who failed their notice magic check, they might feel as if the memories flashing through their mind are just random memories being dredged up out of nowhere, and not think anything magical is in play. With one net hit, they'd also know magic was at play in the area, but not necessarily connect the two concepts. At 2 net hits, they'd be able to connect the two. At 3 net hits, they'd be able to tell if someone they could see was casting the spell on them or not, et cetera.  Something like control actions would play out slightly differently. With no hits, an innocuous action might be disregarded as themselves being clumsy (such as using control actions to force someone to spill their drink or drop something or trip). A more overt action like punching their dinner date in the face out of nowhere, or chucking their gun into a river, or leap in front of traffic would let them know they were being compelled to do these things, but unsure whether it was due to magic, some sort of cyberware malfunction, or themselves going crazy. With 1 net hit in either case, they'll know magic is at play, and the covert spell might not be connected to the act, but the overt one would be. With 2 net hits, the covert spell would be connected with the behavior and the overt spell could be traced to the source if visible. With 3 net hits even the covert spell could be traced to the source."

Though the side which can soak the most damage and has the most available edge will likely scrape out the victory.  In Shadowrun as a player you want to avoid situations like this. Ideally taking cover before fighting and taking advantage of superior range and marksmanship. There is a variety of tools to scout and have awareness of the situation so make use of those.  Ambushes happen and which case the priority should be to make a character who can dodge and soak reliably and to immediately seek cover or even better break line of sight with attackers.  Never fight on your opponents terms if you can help it.

Shadowrun,3ds73j,Bamce,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:24:31 2015 UTC,Samurai could potentially go first but it's not set in stone. In this scenario all involved will spend edge to get 5d6 initiative. The mages will likely spend edge to use the Seize the Initiative rules. Potentially so will everyone else if they have a large edgepool. Both sides will need to reserve some edge for each character to try and resist the AoE mage spells. Because if they come out on top they can AoE down the opposing side first. I mentioned it in an earlier post in this thread but really the fight comes down to which team has more edge and can soak the most damage.  Overall in close undesirable battles like this edge is the most important attribute.
Shadowrun,3ds73j,Bamce,2,Sun Jul 19 01:47:55 2015 UTC,"What if the mages are not there? Do you take actions to address taking damage, or do start attacking?"
Shadowrun,3ds73j,Bamce,2,Sun Jul 19 02:14:05 2015 UTC,"In this case the presence of Fully Automatic Weapons particularly weapons such as the Ares Alpha will have a significant impact on the battle. The Ares Alpha assault rifle does not take much resources to trick out to become become effectively recoil-less even with a Full Auto long burst. This means that many characters will go straight to resisting damage as losing nine dice from the defense test will often be too much to bear. This is again a hugely important factor of edge. A character with high edge may potentially be able to squeeze out a defense test and then completely negate the attack changing the outcome of the battle.  This goes both ways however. For example say we have a particularly skilled shooter who wins initiative with the Ares Alpha assault rifle. If our shooter has a high edge then the edge can be applied first to the roll allowing for exploding sixes. The result can be devastating because even though the attacking dice pool will be split it is unlikely that the softer members of the opposing group such as the decker will have enough defense dice so again will go straight to armor+body. With a high enough dice pool this could immediately knock two shooters out of the fight.  This reinforces the point that the presence of Fully Automatic weapons with a high base DV will have a strong impact on the fight and especially coupled with edge the most important stat for determining the outcome. Because every character could have a strong offensive base with very little invested in resources by simply having a 14+ dice pool to attack with a recoil-less Ares Alpha.   This leads to soaking damage. Characters that spent a large amount of their resources improving their ability to soak damage and have high edge pools will have the potential for incredible offense, high initiative, and the rare ability to potentially soak the damage."

Shadowrun,3ds73j,Bamce,2,Sat Jul 18 23:35:47 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of variables that come into play in this situation, so it's hard to say who would win, or even if you'd want to fight in this scenario.  What skills people have, what weapons they're using, what spells they're slinging, and whether there's anything significantly hackable around (like drones, smartlinks, vehicles, etc.).  I'll make some assumptions:   The street samurai have high level wired reflexes and act at least twice, and thus go before anyone else in the groups They're using assault rifles with SA/BF/FA modes and wireless smartlinks enabled Everyone else has an Ares Predator Everyone is wearing armoured jackets Nobody is using special ammo, it's all regular The mage has Manaball and Stunball, as well as the single target Manabolt and Stunbolt The face has high Leadership, and everyone else on their team respects their leadership and thus are able to be commanded by them (enabling assistance from Leadership actions) There are three cars parked on either side of the road and no traffic There are no civilians No buildings have easy access for at least 30m in either direction The nearest corner of the block is 50m+ No alleys are available to duck down (it's a giant block spanning building on either side of the street, perhaps an apartment complex alleyway)   Priority for either side is taking out the other's mage.  But, assuming that these teams have never seen each other before, there could be no distinction between the face and the mage.  The decker (unless he has an internal cyberdeck) will likely be identifiable by his hardware.  Given this lack of knowledge, and the assumption that the other street sammy is a tanky mofo, the best and obvious target is the decker, because he's going to screw with the smartlink (amongst other things, like the cars in the area).  So my opening move as a sammy is either shooting the decker, or suppressive fire the entire lot if they're bunched up, and hope for the best.  The decker, assuming he survives, may be next.  They're the next most likely candidate for augmentation to improve their combat abilities on the list, even if it's just a slight boost to reflexes.  After seeking cover, priority is taking out the other team's weapons, or removing their cover.  Option 1 is brute force the gun and hope to brick it, or apply enough marks to do an eject clip action next round.  Option 2 is hack the nearby cars to a) run the opposition over, or b) remove cover from the opposition.  Option 3 is arguable, hack the lights overhead to impose sight penalties for shooting targets in darkness, but with so many ways to counter poor lighting this isn't a great option.  This is assuming the decker isn't also a rigger with drones that can offer fire support, and also that there are no drones in the vicinity that could be hacked (it's an isolated alleyway with no chance of running without getting shot up).  Next up the face might have the initiative, he could be an adept, and might have taken a level of improved reflexes or something.  Again after seeking cover, he could provide leadership to the team to improve initiative with rally (possibly give the mage initiative if he's close to 11 initiative so he can act twice), or he could fire his pistol.  Or he could try to demoralise the opposition with Intimidation (natural targets are the street sammy or the decker, assuming he is in AR mode), assuming the GM allows that to impose a penalty.  Last is the mage, likely not sustaining a spell yet that would sustain a boost to initiative.  This turn, he makes himself known as the mage, attempting to blow up the opposition with Manaball.  While not normally a smart move, with everyone bunched up (possibly) he could finish the fight in a single attack with an overcharged spell, force 10 or 12.  It's risky, he'd possibly knock himself out, but there's almost no chance that half the enemy team could survive, or if they did they'd be on death's door and anything else would finish them off.  Wound modifiers would make anything else they do easier to manage for your team, and you being out cold could be rectified by a stim patch if someone has one.  If they did split up so that you couldn't hit most or all of them, Manabolt or Stunbolt on the sammy is the best bet.  He's not going to have a high willpower, and those spells do direct damage with no other resistances.  Without him providing suppressive fire your team can rush theirs and finish them off more easily.  It's likely at this point that someone has died on either side, possibly multiple people, and the team that had initiative is likely the one who's coming out with more survivors.  The following rounds are basically mopping up the opposition, starting with the mage now that he's been revealed (if he's still alive and awake), the decker (if he didn't die in the opening salvo), sammy, and then the face."

At its core, that is what shadowrun is all about, hard choices that always have tradeoffs. Nothing is free."

Shadowrun,3drg1u,Allarionn,2,Sun Jul 19 20:12:58 2015 UTC,"When you craft a Focus, you roll Magic + Artificing [formula Force] vs the formula Force + Object Resistance. The net hits of that check will determine the actual Force of the Focus in the end.  Electronic equipment is going to have an Object Resistance of about 9. Computers (which the Commlink is just a pocket computer) have 15+. So right there, it's rolling at least 10 (assuming formula 1) to resist being made. If it were formula 1, you only get to count 1 hit to try and make it. While mathematically it will be averaging at least 3 hits to resist. If you went with the 15+ math instead, you're rolling some number of dice, only able to count 1 hit, while it's averaging 6 hits against you.  Long story short, it's REALLY tough to enchant electronic devices. That's why you hear about magical broomsticks, and magic wands, more than you hear about enchanted computers."

Sure, if I was GMing I'd make it harder, but by RAW it is only harder if you do it yourself, and lets face it, no one does their own artificing."
Shadowrun,3drg1u,helionwulf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:28:26 2015 UTC,That makes sense.  Seems to be the same mechanic behind the Analyze Device spell.  Part of the reason why I'm worrying about it now is because its something I can start with at character creation rather than worry about getting it made in-game.  Perhaps a case for the commlink would be a better idea instead.  Socially I would have plenty of reason to keep it near to me and not let others have it for privacy sake.
Shadowrun,3drg1u,Bamce,3,Sat Jul 18 19:28:19 2015 UTC,"A simple cloth cover would definitely be easier to enchant.  The reason I mention the math behind it, is b/c if someone came to me and said they wanted an NPC to craft an enchanted Commlink, I would run them through the numbers necessary, to justify to them why I'm charging 5-10x the price for it. They couldn't go to any random Talismonger to get it done. The would need to find an Archmage Artificer or something, and that work wouldn't be cheap."

I would also stay away from fetishes. As, if you don't have them with you, you can't cast the fetished spell.  Remember that foci will carry your astral signature, and will show up if they are visible and you are assensed. They will also trip mana barriers if they are active.   From the sounds of things, you should skip foci at chargen, grab them later, your priorities are already gonna be strained."
Shadowrun,3drg1u,psykulor,2,Sat Jul 18 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"Good point here.  The GM from the last game decided to retcon the whole thing and told us we can make new characters but carry over a bit of karma and a little bit of our resources.  So the main area I'm squeezed in is having enough skills to be a face and a magician.  I do have enough nuyen and karma to afford a rating 3 power focus though!  If I were starting without that, it would be too much of a strain at character creation for me.  Edit: Do runners usually go through that many commlinks?  I usually have the best commlink I can afford and then 2-3 meta-links as burner phones that can't be traced back to me as easily."

Just don't expect to be able to talk your way out of a shootout.  I played a decker/face for like, two decades, across 3 versions of the game, since everyone else wanted their razorgirl and couldn't actually go anyplace civilized without SWAT teams showing up. Re-skimming the 5e book, some of the bioware (cerebral booster) you'd want for this isn't in the base rules, I assume that's in one of the other books."

Sure you can go through your Fixer for every piece of equipment and ware you buy, but anything over avail 15 or so is gonna be hard(if he has the statblock in the book) and he's probably gonna take a while. A solid Face can have that Pain Editor at your Street Doc's by Monday, no problem.  It also massively affects how much you can fence stolen goods for. You shouldn't be nicking stuff like it's Skyrim, but for certain high value items relatively easy to cleanse of RFIDs it can make a pretty penny if your face can get 45% or so instead of the 30% a Loyalty 6 Contact gets you. That could easily mean the difference of a few thousand nuyen payout on a high value item like a Monofil, deck(good luck cleaning it though), or Heavy Weapon."

Shadowrun,3dnjoh,FloobyBadoop,12,Fri Jul 17 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"I'll suggest being proactive.  When you get a call about meeting with a Johnson, immediately suggest a place and time.  Do this before the Johnson offers and make sure it is ritzy enough that the Johnson won't turn it down.  Johnsons want someplace safe, and given the chance they'll pick someplace where they have all the power.  When you invite them to someplace exclusive, it shows that you have clout and you're willing to pull some strings to get them in.  It also puts you on even grounds with them.  Upsell.  There is a strategy that works all the way down to the microbial level.  Let's talk about drinks.  If you've got a $10 bottle of cheap wine, and a $20 bottle of fine wine, people invariably go for the cheap wine.  However, when you introduce a $100 bottle of champagne,  they go for the $20 bottle because at least it isn't $100.  The Johnson is going to come in and want the job done on the cheap, but cheap don't pay the bills.  Offer to do the economy job, but also offer to do the job 'right' for more money but then offer the super platinum job for a lot more money.  Nobody's going to bite on the super platinum but it tells the Johnson that you're good enough to do it.  Since he doesn't want to look cheap, the middle priced 'right way' is what he'll go for."

Shadowrun,3dnjoh,PinkTrench,7,Fri Jul 17 20:44:30 2015 UTC,"As an isolated character, this is beautiful advice. If you have a good team you can trust, you can be so much more. A good team has skills that reinforce each other. Having another charismatic character (a shaman for example) who can back you up can open door that would be inaccessible alone. It allows cons an scams that are impossible alone.   In the same way, you can be a better part of the team. Being a face lets you get close to people. Buff up your palming skill because you can shake someone's hand an hit them with a tranq patch, plant a RFID chip on them, swipe their access card, or any number of things. Take advantage of your ability to get in an get close. This requires putting yourself out front and at risk. You have to be able to hold out and trust your team to come in for the rescue once you have made your move.   You can talk your way into a facility and get the hacker access to a closed system. You can get yourself alone in a room with a target you need to kidnap or kill. You will be alone a lot, but you need to know your team has your back when you are running point for them. You need a plan and they need to know the plan and stick to it.  My personal face is a social adept and I cant say enough good things about this build. It offers plenty of options for social interactions with room for a few infiltration and combat abilities to be useful in other spheres. The Missile Mastery skill is particularly useful. You can walk into a room without a weapon on you and still be able to defend yourself. At one point I threw the chair I was sitting on at an attacker and took them out. Commanding Voice is another powerful option, not for finesse situations, but when your life is threatened. Ordering someone holding you at gunpoint to drop their weapon and knowing that they will comply is a powerful trick to hold up your sleeve. I am of course talking about a very different playstyle of face than you are, but I find it quite rewarding and exciting."

Anyways, we managed to bail out, mage used the sustaining focus to pull off a Thorndor exit.

Sure the street sam can kill them all but in the event you are going to need a sierra team to spot and geek the guy taking pot shots your sammy cant be bothered to shoot or the mage being a subtle frakking nuisance. Hell a bunch of meat bodies soaking up shits with a drive by is a nice distraction. Get contacts that can actively ruin a corpsecs day in the loudest manner so you can get out almost unnoticed.

A bag of c4 dropped for you, an offsite mage that helps you assense who the mage is amongst them or a rent a sniper who will pick off targets for you or have someone plant a script that delays the police response by 30 second. Hell a getaway rigger will be your best friend. It isnt just about making friends with Johnsons but also connecting with the details that runners take often for granted"

What is her SES and does she have a SIN and is it a corporate or national? Family?   If you have Run Faster the life modules are great for fleshing a backstory out for people unused to doing much.  Whenever I write a character for any medium I pick 2 to 4 one word personality traits or quirks.  I also use the big 5 OCEAN for detailed characters. Might as well use that psychology background for more than a reminder of debt. It is Openness to Experience and Intellect, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.  What that means for shadowrun is Openness to experience that is low is someone who is habitual and doesn't like to try new things. Very by the book.  Traditional. A runner like that with an history of B/E is going to be relunctant to take an extraction job because he hasn't done it before.  Openness to intellect is how curious the character is. Usually correlates to education and Logic but not necessarily. An high score in this means a character might be always buying that new ebook and talking about the latest machine language algorithm especially if they are high in extroversion. They might be avant garde in fashion wearing next season's clothes.  Conscientiousness is how well they show up on time, work hard, keep their word.  Agreeableness is how well they avoid conflict with others. Can be a good thing but teams with all high agreeableness get groupthink issues.  Extroversion-introversion is really about what recharges you. Does going to the club and chatting with a bunch of strangers help you let off some steam or would you rather discuss hacking or magical theory with your two best friends on your couch? How assertive are you? How overt are your social manipulations? A skilled introvert might make someone else agree with them by getting them to think that an idea is their idea whole the extrovert is more likely to convince someone with a lot of words, flash, and bang.  Neuroticism deals with negative emotions. Is your character moody, get depressed, bipolar etc.  As far as that once you have a rough sketch of the character's personality and history building them is easy and fast with chummer5 or omae which are linked on the sidebar."
Shadowrun,3do4r4,Tyrhaynes,2,Fri Jul 17 22:34:00 2015 UTC,"First, I'm gonna break a misconception.   CHARISMA IS NOT THE BE ALL AND END ALL  Faces require some good roleplaying and on the spot thinking to pull off, they aren't just mechanical ""I roll 20 dice to do a thing please"". This can make them difficult in a roleplay sense, however if you can pull it off you can enjoy a massive benefit.  Your first choice: Am I making a Mundane or awakened? If making a mundane, are you going to have a lot of edge, a lot of ware or both? (Don't be afraid to aug up, your tailored pheremones make your social limit even out) If making an adept, are you going to be a mage or an adept? If adept. Grab some ranks in cool resolve, Authoratative tone, maybe voice control or kinesics.  Next, if money allows, you want a suit to look good in. I'm quite Partial to the Mortimer of London Line's Berwick Suit with an Argentum coat, however all the fancy stuff is nice. This is going to be your main sorta stuff, but make sure you have some slumming clothes for when you need to not look like you have money and power oozing from every orifice. An Armoured Jacket will suffice.  Qualities you want: First impression (because the majority of the time you meet someone only once ), Fame, Blandness, Human Looking, Trustworthy, and probably some more.  Go whatever metatype you want. Don't be tricked into thinking elf = best face. I have made orks that consistently roll 22 dice and trolls who break 20 often too. It's even more possible now that troll reduction surgery is a thing. A personal favourite build of mine is A (ork), B Skills, C Attributes, D Magic, E Money. (Results in 4 edge, 6 magic dapper ork with face dice for days)  You want skills. Go skills B (skills C if you're REEEEAALLLY squeezed).

So his contact says he needs a big favor, knows this is above the usual call, so he'll pay him super well for the trouble. It should be like 2-3 times what the character usually earns for anything.  The favour is that they need a doc to discretely patch up some whores that a client hurt pretty badly. So far, sounds like a good deed. Doctor goes, treats the girls. At this point, despite the appearance that the Vory is providing medical care, so looks like they care about the girls, it should become obvious the whores are miserable. One might say she'd rather the doctor kill her than patch her up, she doesn't want to go on. Others should say much, too terrified to say anything.  One of the girls should require pretty serious care, or maybe she was slashed in the face in a way that won't heal well. The doctor should diagnose that. The contact appears to be very ""oh, that's terrible, we'll take care of her, of course, she'll have the best care"". Then a week later, the doc should find out the Vory executed the girl and dumped her body in a dumpster, since she wasn't going to be bringing in income anymore.  Basically, the Vory contact should lie and lie and lie to the doc's face, telling him everything and anything he wants to hear. The reality of the violence and horror he commits behind his back should be hinted at indirectly. And, you should put money in his hand. Cause then, he's part of the problem too, and now he has a real choice to make.  It's easy to say ""no"" when you're not being offered shit tons of badly needed money for doing itsy bitsy little corrupt acts. But those acts add up."
Shadowrun,3dnhe0,BackgammonSR,2,Fri Jul 17 21:32:40 2015 UTC,A variation of that. Have one of the whores be a bunraku style with a personafix of a russian trid star. Have both personalities interact with the doc.  The triads and the vory are both trying to experiment with yak style bunraku puppets and stealing each others work to reverse engineer it.

They don't know where the made man, lets call him Wu, they don't know where Wu is, but they do know where Wu's wife and child are, or if you want to mix up gender roles you could say Wu is a made woman and you need to kidnap Wu's husband and kid.  Anyway, Wu is not a nice person and has a short temper and will act with violence first instead of giving in to the Vory's demands. So the Vory will have no choice but to off one of the hostages.  In theory this should start crossing a moral line, and should have the Vory start to look a bit more ruthless.  Also making an example of a shop owner that preferred paying protection money to the Triads, could also help paint some shades of grey in there. After all, crime is a business, and they can't have anything threatening that."

Don't ever tell the players what the crime they're cleaning up was, but make it clear that it was horrible. Someone the characters know from the mafia has been taken in by the police, and has gone into witness protection after making a deal. Heat from the cops is too high right now for the Russians to move personally, but they still want the snitch to get stitches, so they bring the players in as an outside agent to kill the guy who talked. What doc thinks is a shipment of drugs or something is actually much worse (like live shifters being brought in for their hides or blood sport or something). Put them on the villain side of the movie John Wick. The son of some influential mobster did something really, really terrible, and now he needs to vanish for a while and be protected from the vigilante/police/gang/whatever.

One of the big scary drawbacks of trying to make magical artifacts and foci is the possibility to permanently lose essence.  More esoterically, the character could have a crippling Geas or series of Geasa that, while not actually removing his magical ability, seriously constrain his ability to use it. Perhaps he can only cast healing magic with the rise of a new moon. Perhaps he can only cast combat magic when innocents are in danger. If he's a christian theurge, perhaps spirits will only answer his summons on holy ground.

It takes some skill to carefully remove cyberware, and even more skill for bioware. You can't just take a buzzsaw or machete and have at it. An extended test would be necessary, at a decent rating like 14, with intervals measured in the tens of minutes, or even hours, depending on the complexity of the 'ware. If your players haven't invested points in Cybertechnology or Biotechnology, they shouldn't  have the ability to remove the ware in a functional state.  Your players would be better off making friends with a chop shop, then just selling the corpses to him so they can remove it.  As stated by others, the street value of a stolen good is only between 20% - 33%, which makes stealing anything without an already high retail price tag not worth the risk.   And the risks can be considerable. First, you can be tracked. RFID tags are obvious, but then you have to deal with Ownership. The Owner of the device can always look up its location, as long as it's in an area with a Matrix connection, and it takes a very significant Hardware test to remove that ownership.  Even if your players are just removing this stuff from gangers off the street, with serial numbers, tags, and ownership all removed, then, again as others have said, the criminal syndicates who deal in used 'ware are almost certainly going to find out about it.   If they go to a syndicate chop shop (Tamanous, Kumon'go, the Yakuza, and the Vory are the biggest players in Seattle's illegal 'ware market), this can be more easily taken care of: the chop shop just insists the boss' cut be taken out of what they pay the PCs.   If they don't do that, the syndicates will eventually get wise. If the PCs are powerful and somewhat connected, they might send a warning first (""You're doing this on our turf. Pay us, or we kill you."")  But if your PCs are the kind of two-bit jackasses that pass for runners these days, the syndicate will just send guys to beat them within an inch of their life, then tell them whose turf they're on.  Others have talked about the media presence, but that's a bit absurd. Out of all the news going on, the media has more profitable things to focus on than dead gangers and security guards missing some 'ware. And that's assuming your PCs aren't disposing of the bodies.  A far more likely hit to their reputation might come from reports that the team has sticky fingers on runs, which is certainly something Johnsons will hear and talk about. Stealing during the job isn't taboo, but it's unprofessional, and you should have that reflect in the kind of Johnsons willing to hire an unprofessional crew.  All that said, if your players find a way around all of the above, they should be able to reap the rewards of a well-executed plan. It's just your job to make sure they aren't getting easy money."

Also, selling is only at 20% of value on the black market.  And finding a buyer isn't easy, takes time.  The face normally does it.  Then once you get a buyer it's only 20%.  It's normally not worth it, at all, to steal things.  Normally you'll want to only steal things that are really worth it.

Shadowrun,3dlgoc,Damienkn1ght,2,Fri Jul 17 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"Excellent.  Character Morals are the best when they develop organically throughout the run.  I am GMing a group of mostly new players.  They are looking for missing exterminators from a waste treatment facility.  Their search led them to an area in Redmond near the Renton border.  Their drones spotted a group of more than a dozen Night Hunter gangers trolling about the neighborhood, roughing up the denziens.  Intel told them the Night Hunters are a cybered up Human gang that hates metahumans.  When a couple of the gangers sped by on motorcyles near the group, everyone laid low except the troll, who charged into combat.  Pretty quickly the group came into an all out fight with the gangers in the dilapidated ruins of a auto repair garage, where a handful of homeless orks were hiding.  The group courageously battles the evil gangers, blowing up a car and taking out 5 of the group, knocking out the other 10.  In a rage, two of the characters each executed an unconscious ganger.  We had to call it a night, finishing the run tomorrow.    One of the new players, a 6'7"" giant in real life, confided in me, 'When I made my Dwarf War Vet character, I didnt really think about how being a dwarf would affect my role playing.  But during the meet I realized my character is proud of being a dwarf, and doesnt like being looked down on.'    I think caution told him to avoid unecessary conflict.  But seeing his fellow shadowrunner charge haplessly toward the group inspired in him a feeling of comraderie with his fellow metahumans.  I love character development!!  Now I can't wait to see what happens this week when the group finds out that hiding in the garage is a homeless troll with two human teenage girls held captive.  The troll murdered the employees the runners are looking for, and is the only way they are going to find out where the bodies are.  He also kidnapped the girls from a nearby renton neighborhood, and the Night Hunters were out roughing up the locals trying desperately to find the missing girls.  I think they are going to see that this game is not 1st edition D&D.  Each encounter is more than a list of randomly generated monsters to slay.  Shadowrun is a world full of real people with real motivations.  There is no easy black and white, and they as players are going to have to figure out what their characters really believe."

Shadowrun,3dlgoc,Paddywagon123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"It went great.  The characters were ancy to get away from the scene of the gang fight, so when their trail led to the room with the troll, they didn't wanna make a scene.  They asked the troll if he had seen two asian men.  He replied, 'No, they arent asian.'  He convinced them he knew nothing of the missing men (they failed an intuition/con check to guess that he was lying) and the players decided to let him go.  They backed off while he gathered up the bundle of living beings and started to leave.  They speculated widly at what he was hiding.  Some said 'Vampire Dwarves!', others said, 'Probably just his kids he is protecting, and they are too scared to peek out.'  On the way out two of the characters succeeded a visual perception test and noticed pink shoelaces dangling from one of the bundles.  Instincts kicked in and the human female character said, 'Wait, stop him.'  A quick fight ensued, and the troll was knocked out, his bound and gagged prisoners dropped and revealed to the players.  The characters agreed to let the mage mind probe the unconscious troll to figure out what was going on, and he took the troll back to the room for privacy.  He absolutely destroyed the mind probe test, and got two bonus successes from 'Analytic Mind' quality, and put the whole story together.  After gleaning a lead on who showed up and took the bodies from him, and the truth about the girls and why the gang was after them, he decided to smother the troll.  When he came out and informed the group what he discovered, they were so mad the female character walked in and shot the troll in his head.  She failed to notice he was already dead.  I think the players/characters were so abhorred by their unwitting saving of the guilty troll, they had to kill him to make themselves feel better.  They didn't seem to feel to bad about the handful of gangers that had not survived the battle (most were unconscious, but a few dead).  I feel like they still are convinced that murdering the reputed-to-hate-metahuman gangers was a good thing.  The battle did reveal some characters willingness to kill, and others hesitancy to.  Some of them are real 'morally justified' executioners, whereas the mercenary dwarf seemed to take deaths in stride, but didnt feel the need to dole out street justice.  Also, the new group proved to each other that they were ready to jump into a morally uncertain gunfight in order to back each other up, and were not going to hold the consequences too harshly against each other.  Fantastic team building and moral exploration.  I am a little disappointed though that none of the players or characters decided to be a moral center, and hold the group accountable for unnecessary murder.  Oh well, I guess it is what I should expect from a mismatched team of SINless criminals :)"

Shadowrun,3djyr4,Wizworm,13,Thu Jul 16 21:49:32 2015 UTC,"It's a problem with the way they write in general. None of the rules are ever kept in a single spot for easy reference. In fact, some of the ""complete rules"" span several books before you get the whole picture. That way you have to buy the entire library before you know how the game is really played. Just in time for a new edition, and a new library.  For instance, the SR5 Core refers to people using Flashlights to see in the dark. Heck, that seems pretty simple, right? And yet, the actual game mechanics explanation of just how much they help, is in Run and Gun.  The Magic section talks about Background Count having an effect on spellcasting. But you need Street Grimoire to find out what Background Count does at all. Same goes for some of the Technomancer rules, which outright says ""This will be discussed in Data Trails instead."" Except then we find out Data Trails doesn't have all the info on TMs we were hoping for, and there's rumor of a TM specific book in the future to cover that.  The only way I've found to manage finding rules for stuff, is Ctrl+F through the PDFs."

Shadowrun,3dn7ek,RiffyDivine2,7,Fri Jul 17 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"A single point isn't a huge hit, especially if you can invest in some Alphaware augs. That way you can get a few more bits, or stronger bits, for less Essence impact. Since you lose access to 1 full point of Magic, even if you only chose a 0.1 implant, you may as well use up the rest and get a full 1.0 worth of implants.  Even if you can't afford all the implants at CharGen, the fact that you already took 0.1 off your Essence means you can take 0.9 worth later on without losing anymore Magic. So you could save up and eventually buy a Suprathyroid or something.  Cyber Eyes are indeed one of the ways to augment ""Line of Sight"" for spellcasting. Since you paid Essence for them, they became part of you. Another way would be to get ""analog"" binoculars. If they use lenses and mirrors for magnification, they will work for spellcasting. But if they use digital imagery, they don't.  Datajacks (or Trodes if you want to avoid the Essence hit) are pretty awesome. They give you Direct Neural Interface (DNI) which lets you operate your devices completely hands-free.

Sure, you could lightning bolt the eye and destroy it, and I think you would end up taking dumpshock if it happened, and astral spells would certainly hit you through it, but you couldn't just 'hurt the eye, hurt the mage'. I do definitely agree that if there's a connection one direction then there's a connection the other direction, though."
Shadowrun,3dn7ek,marcus_gideon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:36:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed... I wouldn't expect damage to the eye would carry over to you. However, it would count as a Material Link.

You can still overcast, though the max is lowered, and very little of your spells rely on Magic. The greatest downside is the increased chance of overcasting: it's 1 less hit to turn drain from Stun to Physical.  But this can be offset by having more drain dice to begin with. It's possible now to get a Human Hermetic to start with 10 Logic (Exceptional Attribute, Genetic Optimization, Cerebral Boosters 2). With Willpower 5 that's 15 that you're throwing around.

I think Mystic adept is best because you get adept powers as well as counter-spelling and banishing. But because all the higher magic priorities come with spells tacked on you need to ask your GM for permission to take karma to spend on power points and binding foci. With priority A: Magic you can get 6 magic, counter-spelling and astral combat at 5 (astral combat can take place at any range as long as you can perceive and are dual-natured, which you are while using the astral perception power), and spend the 50 karma (10 spells converted back to 5 karma each) of 6 power points (5 each), a weapon focus rating 3 (9 karma) and a counterspelling focus rating 4 (8 karma).

Shadowrun,3dlm8v,Neyarid,6,Fri Jul 17 07:05:41 2015 UTC,"Your damage tracks are your HP. In D&D terms, your Physical damage track is your Hit Points, and your Stun damage track is your Subdual HP.   Combat is resolved in this order:  Attack > Defend > Calculate damage > Soak.   Example:   Stevie Street Sam shoots at George the Guard, and gets 5 successes.   George the Guard defends and gets 3 Successes.   5 (Attack) - 3 (Defense) = 2. This number is added to the base damage of the weapon.   Stevie the Street Sam is using a Heavy Pistol of badassery, which has a base damage of 8P. The net hits from before are added to this number, giving a total of 10.   George the Guard only has 8 armor, which is less than 10. That means he's taking Physical (HP) damage.   George the Guard rolls soak (Body+Armor), and gets 3 hits.   George marks off 7 boxes of his physical track, and is nearly dead.   End of attack."
Shadowrun,3dlm8v,Ympulse101,3,Fri Jul 17 07:16:43 2015 UTC,"An excellent summation: also armor piercing subtracts from the soak only, and only up to whatever armor the unfortunate George happens to be wearing."
Shadowrun,3dlm8v,Malkleth,3,Fri Jul 17 09:39:53 2015 UTC,"Minor bit important clarification  Ap takes away from armor, not soak.   The difference being that you can have all the armor pen in the world. I still get to roll body against the damage"
Shadowrun,3dlm8v,Bamce,2,Fri Jul 17 14:24:56 2015 UTC,"The damage tracks are pretty simple. You've got one for getting knocked out and one for dying. If a weapon does stun damage, it does stun damage. If it does physical damage, it does physical damage unless it is mitigated by armour enough to reduce it to stun damage. To figure out if it was mitigated, you take the armour rating of the defender and then apply any armour piercing modifier for the attack. If the resulting number is less than the total damage from the attack, then the defender takes physical damage.  The thing that usually messes people up is rolling defense and then if there is a hit, separately rolling soak."
Shadowrun,3dlm8v,xcbsmith,2,Fri Jul 17 07:21:48 2015 UTC,"It is confusing, but once you wrap your head around it it makes sense. Every weapon does an amount of damage and has an amount of AP (armor piercing). The first thing you do is look at your characters weapon skill and your agility, and the other person looks at the their characters stats. You roll your dice (skill+Agility), they roll their dice (Reaction+Intuition). Now lets say you are punching some guy with your cyberarm. Your character has Unarmed 6 and 6 agility. The guy you are punching has 4 reaction and 2 intuition. He gets lucky and rolls 4 hits, but you still roll 5. This means you hit him and, because the threshold for success the number of hits he rolled, you get 1 net hit going into damage calculation.  Okay, so you scored a hit, what does that mean. Well one of the big mistakes people make in turn based games is that people associate turn actions with the way an actual fight would work. You aren't just punching him in the face, maybe you hit him multiple times, and maybe he blocked did so poorly. But what happens mechanically, which for unarmed is your character's strength, is that they take physical damage because you hit them with a big piece of metal (which happens to also be your arm). Assuming you don't have a super enhanced arm let's say your characters strength is 5. That means you deal 5 damage plus the number of net hits you get, which in this case is 1. Now that you deal a total of 6 damage, the guy you attacked has to resist it. First let us look at his armor; let's say he has an armor of 8. If your weapon pierced armor he would then have to decrease that number by however many points of AP your weapon had. He then has to roll a number of dice equal to his armor (8) plus his body stat (call it 3). That means he has 11 dice to try and prevent damage called soak dice.  Before he rolls he does a quick check to see what kind of damage he is taking. The attack does physical damage, but he is lucky that his modified armor is greater than the damage he is taking because that means it becomes stun damage. He rolls 11 dice, but now his luck is up, and only gets 2 hits. He subtracts those 2 hits from the 6 damage he was hit with and takes 4 damage.  Now that he has taken 4 damage, he has to check his condition monitor. Because this is the only damage he has taken so far, he makes a note of the damage and acquires 1 wound. Getting a wound happens every 3 boxes of damage you take on either track, and means all your dice pools get the number of wounds you have subtracted from them. If he tried to run away, he would have one less die for his sprint action.   Hope that whole mess clarifies it a bit. I think everyone is in agreement that Catalyst needs to hire on some editors and a technical writing specialist."

Shadowrun,3dlct5,ElevatedUser,4,Fri Jul 17 05:23:35 2015 UTC,"Being able to use weapons is, in my opinion, not that big a deal. At decent force, you need pretty high-end weapons to top Elemental Attack. But it gives options you don't otherwise have - range or supressive fire. (They can use guns too btw). They get Magical Guard, though, which is very useful. It lets them counterspell, on top of what you do yourself - which means you're very well protected against enemy mages. They have some nifty other powers as well.  Guidance has some unique powers that can help a lot. Beasts, I'm not sure I agree with, though. It does have some nice powers, but nothing you can't get from other places, in otherwise more useful spirits."
Shadowrun,3dlct5,Valanthos,2,Fri Jul 17 07:18:13 2015 UTC,"They are really useful at around force ~7 or so but, yeah if you summon strong enough spirits the weapon power becomes less useful.

Shadowrun,3dlct5,Valanthos,3,Fri Jul 17 11:24:12 2015 UTC,Guardian is arguably the best combat spirit as it can use weapons. Guidance is good at mystic support and legwork. Beast has animal control and some decent powers to fill several interesting roles.
Shadowrun,3dlct5,Valanthos,2,Fri Jul 17 05:45:09 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, thanks!  When you summon a guardian spirit, do they come with weapons, or do you need to provide them?

It's also not to bad at the old ultraviolence thanks to pluses in both its agility and strength stats and access to venom and natural weapons (we play it that the natural weapon damage is in addition to strength, that's probably not strict RAW but is the only interpretation that makes sense to us as otherwise the power is pointless)."

Shadowrun,3dlct5,LC_HoTS,2,Fri Jul 17 05:31:51 2015 UTC,you could but it'd have to be a pretty big air spirit for anything bigger then a child. And a spirit that big is liable to peace out because he's bored (and air spirits are ALWAYS bored jackasses)
Shadowrun,3dlct5,TempestK,4,Fri Jul 17 05:35:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, you are right. I just checked SR5 and spirits of fire have flight as a skill, but spirits of air do not. In addition, fire spirits have higher physical stat lines relative to force, which would be needed for lifting someone. Based on their Body (F+1), Agility (F+2), and their Strength (F-2) a force 11 spirit of fire could carry the average human male (90 kilos) 62 plus 10 meters (20 dice for sprint test, buying hits). That's 72 damage with -4 AP before soak and with a minimum initiative of 27 to get it done all in one combat turn. Of course, all of this assumes they fail their defense rolls and you aren't fighting a frag off sized, cyber'd up troll inside. But to be fair, it's still wiz."

Shadowrun,3dln8v,Bamce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:17:20 2015 UTC,"First, thank you for commenting and suggesting this new priority arrangement. I did get the feeling that aspected mages were not the best idea, but I couldn't figure out how to make a front line gun wielding mage otherwise.  Correct me if I am wrong, but the reason I got a 12 pool in longarms, was because I figured throwing combat magic around would be a good way to take a lot of unnecessary stun damage. However, I just looked closer at drain values, and a force 5 lightning bolt would only cause 2 drain, which 11 drain dice should soak 95% of the time while giving 5 + hits damage. In this case, would it be worth it to just drop the longarms focus altogether and use combat spells for offense?     If you don't mind me asking, how would you arrange the attribute/skill array for your priority suggestion?  A) magic  B) attributes  C) ork  D) skills  E) $     This is my attempt:  BOD: 5, AGI: 4, REA: 5, STR: 3, CHA: 3, INT: 6, LOG: 2, WIL: 5, EDG: 1, MAG: 6  Assensing: 6  Spellcasting: 6 (5 from MAG A)  Counterspelling: 6 (5 from MAG A)  Perception: 4  Stealth Group: 2 (15 karma)  Firearm skill (Automatics or Longarms?): 6  4 left over skill points:      Giving him BOD 5 feels painful, but I suppose with the bear mentor spirit he still has good soak dice. Also, would I be better served going with exceptional attribute for WIL and making that 7, taking one point from REA and INT? I would have to drop the stealth group then.  I kept AGI at 4 because that would allow for Increased Attribute to be cast and sustained on it with focused concentration 4, in the case I want to get some more accurate shooting. I don't know if this is a good idea though.  For my firearms skill, is this still a good idea to have, or should I drop it lower and use combat spells primarily?  Thank you for your help so far."
Shadowrun,3dln8v,McBoobenstein,2,Fri Jul 17 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"What is the rest of your team like?  What do you plan on doing?  As alot of what I'm reading here is ""I wanna be a street sam, but we have no mage, so I'm making a mage into a sam"""
Shadowrun,3dln8v,felicidefangfan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:37:43 2015 UTC,"The rest of our team (to the best of my knowledge) consists of a rigger, hacker, face, and melee adept. The face might be also going partially street sam, but I am not sure.     When I first started making this character, I thought it would be really neat to have a magician who was not the stereotypical squishy caster lurking in the shadows. So I tried to make a tough ork that could be in the front if combat breaks out, and still provide magical support even if he has to dodge/take a few bullets.   Initially, the longarms were to replace his combat magic and give him some partial street sam ability, at the expense of going aspected, but I am thinking that instead I should just focus on making a full mage, and give him a submachine gun or something as a backup in case magic fails (background count, if we need to stay off the astral plane to keep our profile lower, etc).  What I see him doing, is helping before the run with intel gathering, whether through checking out the target for easy entry points, or where and what security is. During the run, I could see him helping the team like levitating them up to the third floor to avoid the guarded lower level, and keeping an eye on the astral plane for spirit guards or wards. If combat breaks out though, I would like him to be able to fight as well as a mage can, especially against any magical threats like spirits which the rest of the team may have a hard time with.     Sorry if that is too vague, I have never played shadowrun before, so I don't have too much experience with how a typical run goes."
Shadowrun,3dln8v,xcbsmith,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:09:23 2015 UTC,"Mages are supposed to be a bit squishy. Use your magic to make you less so. Armor spell, invis, stuff like that. You only need a pistol for when you start taking heavy drain. A mage is really a glass cannon, and rightly so. Magicians can see into the astral, and combat the things he sees there. That's power right there. Trying to be a street samurai that has just a bit of magic isn't the same as having a mage on the team. Yeah, you can shoot a gun, and take damage that you shouldn't be taking if your team is doing their jobs right, but you will be ripped apart by the astral the second you get in trouble.

Shadowrun,3dln8v,felicidefangfan,2,Fri Jul 17 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions first:  1) I believe ritual spellcasting is unnecessary as a player character, unless you plan to use a lot of rituals, as most of the time rituals do things like make wards, or cast a spell at really long range, things which you generally won't need as a shadowrunner (specific scenarios and creative uses are the exception of course). Not to mention you'll need a spotter (and your party has no second awakened and you can't summon spirits) for a lot of rituals.  2) Longarms is a good choice for loudness, I believe the main two areas it suffers are no suppressive fire (I was under the belief this was FA weapons only, please correct me if I'm wrong) and a lack of lots of concealable weapons (pistols are really great for being hidden and automatics includes machine pistols)  3) If you're taking guns for offense then I would focus mainly on utility (though it always helps to have a backup combat spell like fireball for the aoe). Trid phantasm is a really useful spell,  as are physical barrier,  shape [material], detect life and magic fingers   My main critique of your build is your fake sin, rating 1 is useful for groceries and that's about it, you want as high as possible to get past scanners (rating 4 is ideal but 3 is passable for money E). On the same note you need a license for your weapon and a license to practise magic The knowledge skill for firearms is mostly redundant as the active skill covers knowledge of Longarms at rating 6, what were you planning on using it for?  I'd suggest some knowledge skills in areas like mega corps,  syndicates,  security procedures, smuggling (or gun running) squatter is an ok lifestyle,  but I hope you're taking all your expensive equipment with you or its likely to get stolen. Additionally you will likely smell and it's a social faux pas to wear armor in social scenarios so I hope you can hide in the van during the Johnson meet and social infiltration No etiquette skill will make blending in socially difficult,  I'd suggest spending karma to give yourself a rating 1 (perhaps even instead of pilot, you don't have a car and I'm assuming whoever gets one will be able to drive it) I can't see a commlink, how are you communicating with your team and your fixer?  Additionally you'll want Trodes to give you a dni so you can use the commlink without needing any fancy glasses or AR gloves"
Shadowrun,3dln8v,xcbsmith,2,Fri Jul 17 09:14:44 2015 UTC,I believe there is a short-barrel Defiance T-250 that is reasonably concealable...
Shadowrun,3dln8v,xcbsmith,2,Fri Jul 17 09:45:35 2015 UTC,"In which case no problem. As a combat focused character he might not even want concealable weapons anyway, especially if he picks up any combat magic"
Shadowrun,3dln8v,Bamce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:49:47 2015 UTC,"When I first looked at ritual spellcasting, I thought all the rituals were by default known and available. I liked the fluff potential for it then, but after I found out you had to pay 5 karma for each ritual, it lost a lot of appeal. The watcher is about the only thing that still seems good to pay for, but if that is all I use it for, I don't think it is worth it. The Firearms vs Spells question is one I have been debating for this character. Initially, as is in my original post build, I prioritized shotguns over combat spells as I didn't think magic could hold out as well in an extended firefight as guns could. But I am starting to think that if I go priority A magic, I could build a character that is just as good in a firefight with indirect spells, but also has more utility and potential for future growth. Especially since I am the only spellcaster.       Unfortunately, I don't know how I could get the fake SIN much higher then 2 with rating E for nuyen. And even then it would take almost all of my money. I suppose I could just save up and get one after our first payday, as we are going to be playing in lawless barrens gangland to start, along with the fake licences for magic/weapons. Thanks for the point on knowledge: longarms being redundant. I will switch that out for something better. Etiquette is a good suggestion. I will try and include at least 1 point of it, along with con hopefully. I forgot to add the comlink to the original build, thanks for letting me know I missed it. Added a metalink.      Thank you for the reply and critique"
Shadowrun,3dln8v,xcbsmith,2,Fri Jul 17 17:21:20 2015 UTC,"If you are the only magic user in the group, I think you should give up on the aspected magician and go either full-on mage or mystic adept. You want some conjuring/binding/banishment skills in there, and probably higher assensing, since your party is totally relying on you for it.  Logic 1 seems painfully dumb..."
Shadowrun,3dln8v,Bamce,2,Fri Jul 17 09:49:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was thinking this would be the case. I mainly dropped from full mage to aspected so I could fit a little front line gunbunny in, as combat spells seemed risky drainwise to be relying on primarily.   But, now that I look at it more, Force - 3 for combat indirect spells doesn't seem that bad, as it allows for a force 5 with 2 drain, which should be soakable  most of the time. And it has no concealing problems."
Shadowrun,3dln8v,xcbsmith,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah totally. 2 drain should definitely get soaked. If you are doing your mage right you should have an ability to soak up to 4 drain without really having anything to worry about, and you can always make the spell limited and use a fetish. But more than that, the ultimate solution is to have a summoned spirit take the drain for you, but that's not an option if you are an aspected spellcaster. ;-)"

Shadowrun,3dln8v,xcbsmith,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"Well, on my original build I had 5 INT, 5 WIL for 10 drain dice. If I rebuild for a full mage I could put 6 in INT for 11 drain dice, or even go exceptional attribute WIL or INT for 12 drain dice. However, I would have to give up focused concentration 4 then, which I really liked the idea of.  Would 11 drain dice be enough for an ork mage, or should I drop the focused concentration for exceptional attribute WIL or INT?"
Shadowrun,3dln8v,xcbsmith,2,Fri Jul 17 16:18:07 2015 UTC,10 or 11 Drain Dice is totally acceptable at chargen. You just have to be aware of your Drain when casting is all. Elves can reach 13 but they're stuck with a Charisma tradition (which isn't all bad).  May I suggest using Chummer5? https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a  Might make things easier for you.

They also usually show up 3 at a time, so we can't exactly overwhelm them with actions."
Shadowrun,3dl49b,dethstrobe,2,Fri Jul 17 05:53:42 2015 UTC,"You should probably just run away. That armor is restrictive, meaning they can't run without taking instant fatigue damage."

Shadowrun,3dl49b,Zemalac,3,Fri Jul 17 07:39:00 2015 UTC,"A Panther is 17 DV, with -6 AP. Heavy Millspec is 20, right? After AP they'd only get 7 auto-soak (remember, AP is applied befóre applying the Hardened auto-soak). With 30 soak left, you should, on average, deal your net hits in damage. And that's before called shots.  But yeah, it's kind of weird that there's no armor piercing assault cannon rounds - you'd expect that from guns designed to occasionally hit armored targets. As it is now, AC's are on par with (heavy) sniper rifles because of ammo and, well, AC's should do more. Actually, snipers are better - against hardened targets, an APDS Berett can get -22 armor and outright ignore Heavy Milspec. And if snipers can do that, it certainly wouldn't be overpowered for AC's to do that.  The 500-1000 nuyen range sounds fair to me, although availability would be higher as well (around the 20's). It'd be essentially military-grade stuff, though, and will probably attract equal amounts of attention if people find out you have it."
Shadowrun,3dl49b,SenseiZarn,2,Fri Jul 17 08:40:15 2015 UTC,"remember, AP is applied before applying the Hardened auto-soak   I will double check that the GM has been accounting for this, because I don't think he has been.  And thanks!"
Shadowrun,3dl49b,gimlettio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:50:56 2015 UTC,"As an alternative solution, I think the best trick to use against hardened milspec is the same trick that is best against anyone in Shadowrun: explosives in a confined space. Get them into an elevator or corridor or something and then detonate a block of the highest-rating plastique you can get your hands on (or a sack of HE grenades, if you're in a hurry). 20 hardened armor is all well and good against most weapons, but most things turn to paste when you start throwing chunky salsa damage in their direction."

Shadowrun,3dl0c7,Tyrhaynes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth it depending on your build. A low charisma or low binding skill character with a high magic gets a lot of bang for the buck. A force 6 spirit costs about 3k to bind. So, you're basically spending karma to save cash.  I have a few players partial to ork magicians and they always snap up spirits at character creation for a rainy day when they will need their hoops saved."
Shadowrun,3dl0c7,ElevatedUser,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:08:35 2015 UTC,"One point gives one service. One point of karma at chargen is worth 2k nuyen; if you'd only get one service on average from a binding, buying at chargen would be worth it, but you'd be mad to try to bind anything that doesn't have 4 or so services pre-bind. One karma for a service is a terrible deal."
Shadowrun,3dl0c7,Tyrhaynes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:45:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and if your binding rating is 0 to 3 you are unlikely even with average edge to get a service from a spirit at force 6.

EDIT: I remembered seeing one thing that is a good example of why people don't like shamans that may be applicable. One of the ways they would go up a rank in power, for example, was releasing a biological weapon of mass destruction on an urban population. That is the kind of thing toxic shaman do, mass destruction and wanton slaughter. Many of their goals are things like completely wiping humanity off the planet then killing themselves so that the earth can be natural again.

A mutation shaman for example might set off world wide nuclear holocaust so that those who survive become 'better'.

Very few Shadowrunners would pass up that kind of bounty. Also Toxic Shaman's are literally so corrupted by their magic that they literally just want to see the world burn.

He flew in with about two dozen lesser dragons, and who knows how many elementals, during a major hurricane, using his magic and teh elementals to whipe the storm into an absolute frenzy while keeping his followers immune to it. Under that kind of cover, he and his followers vaporized the NatVat facility of Aztechnology on the island, then spent a bit of time playing whack-a-mole, wrecking whatever else tehy felt like destroying while the hurricane ravaged teh island. They all flew off as the storm passed over the island, vanishing before either Aztechnology or the CAS could get planes in teh area.   .  The damage was so bad that the Azzies came in, had a look, gathered their people, and just left the ruins. The CAS sent humanitarian aid, but the island was messed up something feirce and will need a few years to recover. NatVat, however, is just toast at this stage.   (Mind you, there's been talk of CAS annexing Borriqua and returning it to being Puerto Rico as a new CAS state...)"

Shadowrun,3di8zq,Angel-Forest,2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:07 2015 UTC,I'm surprised that wasn't included in the original write up.  You'd have to be a special sort of something to overlook the amount of ware that is 0.1 essence cost.  Right now I'm reading that as known and intentional.
Shadowrun,3di8zq,Mittensworth,2,Thu Jul 16 16:29:53 2015 UTC,"Unless you've read ANY of their other products, and seen just how TERRIBLE the editing can be. For instance, there's a reference in the Core to a defense modifier for AOE attacks... except you don't roll defense against AOE anymore (presumably they thought about it at some point, and never told the modifier guy they changed their minds).  I still don't think it's known or intentional at all. Which is why they start drafting errata the day after they release a product."

Shadowrun,3dhn56,wern212,5,Thu Jul 16 10:12:45 2015 UTC,In the beta of Invisible Inc they didn't use teleporters to enter and exit a building they used elevators. The issue with this was the justification of why you couldn't use the same elevator to enter and exit. So something like this may be usable here.

Shadowrun,3dhn56,Olliesful,3,Thu Jul 16 14:43:41 2015 UTC,"On the topic of teleporters. While instantaneous travel isn't possible (so they say). Spells that increase speed might as well be teleport spells assuming it's cast high enough.   Adding magic to the setting really wouldn't mess things up too badly.  If the AI is being kept outside it's home domain. I.e Server room was destroyed but we managed to save the AI inside this old Deck which reduces her processing power by a huge margin.  Do you intend on telling your players they're playing a Invis Inc. setting game? And if you intend to keep to the story line what are you contingencies if Player B comes up with some amazing idea to lose the corps without doing any of the story line stuff. (i.e If I was put into a scenario like that, I'd hire other shadowrunners to risk their lives for this crap or at least hire more runners to turn a hard run into an easy one)"

Since the agents you break out are already part of the agency, they're willing to hop back in and work. However, I'd say the agency's Notoriety is so high no runner outside of the agency wants to be hired by them because it's a sure fire way to die (Hunted down by ALL 10 Megacorps? No thank you.).  Note also that these NPCs are backup characters for players who get killed off.  And of course, the agency NPCs could totally be Shadowrun-statted versions of everyone in the Invisible Inc game: Decker, Internationale, Banks, Shalem 11, Nika, Dr. Wu, etc.   However, I'd still allow the players the ability to build new runners and have them show up: an incoming transmission gets to the plane and the runner says ""Hey, miss me?"" and the team has to spend travel time to go pick them up from whatever city they're hiding in nearby."

Shadowrun,3dhn56,ozzkore,3,Thu Jul 16 13:09:16 2015 UTC,"As a long time fan, I'd love to contribute and brainstorm this one.  At its heart, Invisible Inc is a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants dungeon crawler. Central is effectively your Fixer/Johnson, and the Big Ten are your corps to infiltrate. Each corp in both games have specialties and use different kinds of security, so research each of the corps and plan every kind of baddie they would throw (Renraku Red Samurais, Aztechnology blood mages, etc.).  Speaking of mages, PLEASE KEEP MAGIC! You have an amazing opportunity to mash Shadowrun characters into the Invisible Inc. style of dungeon crawl. If you're hesitant, remember that it means the corps also get to use magic against the runners. ;)  For the dungeon crawl itself, play games of Invisible Inc. and recreate the floor plans (Roll 20 or physical grid paper lend themselves to this depending if you're playing this online or in person). Then reveal the rooms one at a time as they enter them and hide rooms they exit without hacked cameras (Roll 20 has Hide/Reveal areas for free; physical paper tiles you'd just add or take away). On these maps, I would still include everything from Invisible Inc : cameras, consoles, nanofabs, Null Drones, etc.  I would keep the Matrix rules the same. However, to bring in the Invisible Inc. flavor, you can make Power a pool of points that your decker can use to add 1D6 per point to any Matrix actions, or add 1 to the limit. Incognita would mainly be a flavor character that holds the Power for the Decker/Technomancer to pull from. Incognita could also run the programs that give Power such as Power Drip and Fusion, as well as those auto-hack programs in exchange for their equivalent Power points. But keep in mind she can only hold 5 programs and she starts with 2.  The ""firewall"" points found on each hackable thing in Invisible Inc would be the threshold the Decker needs to beat - so if a camera requires 3 points to take over, the threshold would be 3, or the Decker could use programs like Lockpick to decrease that threshold by using Power. If it's decreased to 0, it requires a Simple Action to make it yours automatically.  In short, your hacker characters will be very happy with the sheer amount of things to do on levels like these. Meanwhile, feel free to drop ICE on them and increase their Overwatch Score: can you imagine a hacker getting dumpshocked out at the last leg of a run when they just needed to hack that vault?  Agility is a big deal stat - it influences Sneaking and likeliness to hit, but ALSO your Walk/Run speed. In Invisible Inc this is akin to your AP, so having lots will be important. Strength, just like in the game, could indicate how many pieces of equipment the runners can carry on them, including physical loot (and of course tell them to decide what they're bringing into the crawl). Invisible Inc. weapons are garbage compared to SR, so scrap them (or make SR stats for the weapons, just name them after the Invisible Inc ones for flavor). The Invisible Inc gear and augments might be interesting though, so go through those and see how you can adapt them.  On the other side of the spectrum, social skills are useless, unless you allow them to put on guard uniforms stolen from who they knock out and roll Disguise and Con against other security. Negotiation would only be good when trading goods with Monst3r. The rest would be for roleplay in between crawls.  On that note - in-between roleplaying while they world-hop from one city to the next isn't a bad thing. But keep in mind that if this takes place over 72 hours, keep it to light banter instead of triggering side missions by botching NPC interaction. Control this by keeping your runners confined to each other, Central, Monst3r, and Incognita in the stealth jet plane. You're also limiting their ability to boost their skills and attributes with their earned Karma because they won't have enough in-game time to boost them as per the rules, but you can always just handwave that and boost them immediately. Legwork is minimal: let them decide which facility to infiltrate and fly there.  I'd keep going but I'm at work. Hope this helps get you started!"
Shadowrun,3dhn56,ozzkore,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:19:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is exactly the kind of brainstorming I was hoping for.  I think I'll keep magic. Sounds like it'll add something (even though it means I have to learn even more rules).  I love your ideas for Power and Incognita. Adding dice and limit will help when things get tough.  Yeah, I wasn't planning on social being very relevant. Think I'll just tell the players that beforehand.  I was thinking I'd just let them spend their Karma instantly, otherwise the stuff is useless.   Now just too convince some people to actually go with my idea...  Oh, one more thing: do I force players to stealth only? I don't think that's a good idea, but I do think I should make it clear that they'll never win a straight-up fight. So only go loud if you are nearly done, or you'll be squashed like a bug."
Shadowrun,3dhn56,xyrafhoan,2,Thu Jul 16 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't force them to do anything, but I would suggest they beef up their Stealth at the highest rating they're willing to afford - if they don't then that's their problem to deal with. Or, you can just give them a bonus 6 skill points to Stealth for being in this type of agency, in addition to their Skill priorities. That way you're not pulling skill points from them.  Also, mages aren't the only roles to prep for. Be prepared for riggers, adepts, technomancers, and other non-Invisible Inc types show up at the table - I think it'd be a blast to see what they can do (and use against the runners as corp security).  Never say never when it comes to fighting - if you're using the SR rules there can be survivors and long combats. Invisible Inc does one-shot kills instead which is why it's so deadly, but Shadowrun can be just as deadly especially if security is beefed up enough to match their prime runner status.   Raise the penalties for getting in to combat: Each combat turn that passes is only gonna raise the alarm (I'd raise it by 2 per turn if they ever have to roll Initiative - if they hit max alarm, send new goons out of each elevator at the end of each Combat Turn). Alarms start blaring all over the place and everything just converges on them - but beware of players with grenades by having plenty of backup!"
Shadowrun,3dhn56,mikekozar_work,2,Thu Jul 16 20:33:09 2015 UTC,"I would play this as a prime runner game, as in use the alternate prime runner rules and not just the changed values in the charge section but the one deeper into the core book. As far as AI is concerned, Data Trails has up to date rules on AI PCs so it is feasible you decide to have Incognita on a device the PCs to take with them. I know the AI doesn't work quite that way in game but you can make your own justifications about how you will get Incognita around security."
Shadowrun,3dhn56,Tyrhaynes,2,Thu Jul 16 13:25:08 2015 UTC,"I just beat Invisible, Inc. the first time this week, an excellent game!  Any Shadowrunner should enjoy it.  How I'd handle it:   Drop the teleporters entirely, there are too many ways to abuse the technology and the implications would change the world too much.  Inserting your team and gear inside of a corporate facility is a major part of a Shadowrun adventure, but you can always handwave it (""You have reached the lobby of Mistuhama's office complex..."") if your characters are good enough.  Alternately, throw some dice and see if you get an Edge or a Complication on the mission.  Either way, if you don't like the insertion portion of the mission, skip it. Invisible, Inc is all about tech, and I would keep the game that way as far as your players are concerned.  Make spellcasters and paracritters strictly opposition, jack up the ""wow"" factor and use them as particularly scary guards.  Perhaps one of the corps has a rep for using Awakened?  Technomancers actually work pretty well, thematically. The Invisible, Inc team is good, but they're not Prime Runners out of the gate.  Start low-powered and give the players room to grow. Incognita might be the hardest team member to model.  Using her as a Decker on remote overwatch fits the theme, and lets you eliminate Matrix actions pretty much entirely from a player perspective.  Your team can focus on infiltration and combat skills, which are pretty fun."

There's some more mention of how dangerous Material Links are in Street Grimoire, but still no actual examples of how you'd find someone with them.  About the best I can come up with, would be to work something on them through a Ritual. Then use the Astral Tracking rules (Core pg 315) to follow the magical link from the casters to the spell effect (which would be on the person).  Or as you mentioned, direct a Spirit to Search for them. So long as the person isn't too far away, the ""per kilometer"" penalty shouldn't stack up.

Shadowrun,3dfta1,falarransted,3,Thu Jul 16 03:57:36 2015 UTC,"Remote Sensing using Detect Individual:  Remote Sensing (Spell, Spotter) This ritual allows you to cast any Detection spell with an even greater range. The area of the spell is increased to Force x (sum total of the participants’ Magic attributes) x 100 meters. The spell’s subject must be present in the foundation during the ritual but may then take his new sense outside the foundation while the ritual participants sustain it for him. All of the participants of the ritual perceive the same thing the subject perceives through the spell. If the spell has a target (like when you use a Mind Link or a Mind Probe spell in the ritual), you’ll need a spotter to have eyes on the target.   This ritual takes (Force) hours to perform. Afterward, if any of the participants stops sustaining the ritual, it ends.   Detect Individual:  Detect Individual (Active, Area) Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 3 The subject can detect the presence of a particular individual anywhere within range of the sense.

But, as said, thanks!"
Shadowrun,3dfta1,gimlettio,2,Thu Jul 16 03:56:30 2015 UTC,"imo this doesn't work using RAW, for starters the Detect Individual specifies ""someone you know or at least have met in the past"".  The second problem is the Remote Sensing (and the Prodigal Spell mentioned below) ritual requires a spotter not a material link, ""someone who can see the target for them"" - and if you've got that, you're past the Finding step :p"
Shadowrun,3dfta1,falarransted,3,Thu Jul 16 04:27:37 2015 UTC,"Sure it could work to send someone to locate an individual.   The Ritual group would cast ""Detect Individual"" on someone within their group, so HE is the target of the Spell, not the individual they are looking for. So no ""spotter"" needed.   And then the recipient of the Spell could roam the city to look for the individual.  A valid method, i would say.   Lets assume some nasty fixer betrayed a little tribe with his last deal, and now they want to find him to get their money back or whatever.  So, 3 of their shamans (let's say each with magic 4) perform the Remote Sensing Ritual on one of their hunters with a force of 5. So the Hunter gets Detect Individual with a radius of 5 x (4 + 4 + 4) x 100 = 6.000m. Now, with that range, the Hunter could take a smooth ride through the streets of Seattle, while the shamans sustain the ritual/spell. Shouldn't take long before he locates the bastard."
Shadowrun,3dfta1,falarransted,3,Thu Jul 16 09:04:23 2015 UTC,"OK that works to fix #2, but #1 is still a problem:  the Spotter still must be looking for ""someone you know or at least have met in the past"" - my objections were in the context of ""you only have a material link"".   Yeah if you've met them before, or even have a picture, now there are multiple ways to find them - you have a ""mental image"" for the spirit Search power too...  (although in reality, I'd be allowing this too since I think the current rules are ridiculous - as the guy below pointed out the rules from 4th (amusingly, only in an expansion, I just checked and 4th ed core had this same problem) allow the use of a material link, or with more difficulty a sympathetic link or symbolic link to substitute for the spotter, and that's needed to make the damn thing work)"

I hadn't looked at this specific point in the rules, but yeah there's a pretty big gap between ""oh no, material link I'm in SO much danger!"" and what's actually in the rules.  Spirit Search says ""anyting the spirit has seen or the Summoner can picture"" which is problematic if all you have is a Material Link.  An Astral Signature actually looks easier to follow, which seems kind of silly....  Right now, the only magic I can easily find that even uses a Material Link to affect a living person is the ""Curse"" Ritual.  Now OK, that's a bit nasty, but you can only cast Illusions thru it.  So yeah you can put the guy in Agony or something as long as you're willing to sustain the spell, but no locating or causing actual damage.  OK ""Blood Sight"" SG p125, requires ""Organic Link"", and at the very top with 5+ successes gives ""brief impressions of the person"" - woooo :p   Maybe ""Augury and Sortilage"", takes Material Link and 5+ hits allows the caster to get the answer to a ""very specific"" question about the target's future.  Maybe ""where will the target be in 5 minutes"" so they could get a spotter there to actually frickin do something.  Unfortunately all the sample questions are yes/no, if that's part of the rule it makes it useless for this purpose.  So I hope somebody steps up with a better answer, because this was sort of disappointing :D  ED:  Oooh I reread marcus_gideon's answer below, and that's a brilliant idea - use the Curse to put a magical effect on the target via Material Link, then use Astral Tracking to follow the Astral Signature - IF it's OK to follow the signature from the source to the target, instead of the usual case which is the opposite.  And as usual, damn the bloody rules that this kind of convoluted nonsense is required to accomplish something that's supposed to be a basic tenet of the setting...  MAYBE you could rule a spirit Search could be ""search for a person that has this Material Link"" or at least ""this blood"" - that seems only a small stretch to the enumerated power."

Thus a spirit's Search power would work as it can ascertain the aura and perform the track.   As for a ritual, I've always ruled that spell auras are two way: You can track back to the mage and the mage can track forward. Spells leave tracers. Given that the Curse Ritual gives you a good guideline for a new Ritual:  Scry (Material Link) Allows an individual to be tracked through a material link which is consumed by the ritual. Finding an individual in this way requires an uninterrupted path which does not have to be straight in astral space. This means that targets may be concealed by enclosed mana barriers - ex. lodges, domed mana barrier located on the earth, etc. - or other means that block astral travel - ex. FAB sealed rooms, dual natured flora enclosures, etc. Individuals hiding in such a way must be hidden in a fully enclosed space or else the ritual will succeed. If an individual is successfully hidden then the ritual automatically fails at completion and no information is gained by the ritual leader.  The link is used as part of the offering and is effectively destroyed during the ritual.  For the duration of the ritual, a link is present between the target and the ritual group while the spell portion is sustained. It is possible to spot the link and use it to track back to the ritual team’s physical location.  The target of the ritual resists with Willpower against a threshold equal to the number of net hits made by the ritual leader in the Sealing Test. If the target meets or exceeds the threshold then the ritual fails and no information is gained by the ritual leader.  This ritual requires (Force) hours to complete.  If the ritual succeeds and the target fails to resist then the ritual leader determines the physical location of the target and is able to assense the target and their surroundings for Force meters in radius before resisting drain for the ritual. After resisting drain the ritual and the ritual leader's sight of the target immediately ends. No spell may be cast through the ritual link. Nor may the ritual leader dispatch a service on a remote service until after the ritual ends. The ritual leader may use the knowledge of the target's location to dispatch spirit(s) on remote services against the target after the ritual - assuming they do not go unconscious from the ritual drain.  The ritual may only affect 1 target at a time."
Shadowrun,3dfta1,Tyrhaynes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:33:01 2015 UTC,"If we hit up 4e, this is what we get from the Material Link section in Street Magic:  Ritual groups may also combine material links (and sympathetic links below) with astral spotters to astrally track a target when its location is unknown. While the ritual team is casting a spell (using the material link), an astral spotter may track the target’s location per the rules on p. 185, SR4. The ritual need not be completed, just maintained long enough to allow the tracker to locate the target.   What are the rules on p. 185, SR4? It's just astral tracking, chummer, so use the rules for it from whatever version that you're using. Here are the 4e rules though:  Astral Tracking Nearly all magical things (spirits, spells, foci, and magical lodges) have an astral link to something. Active spells are linked to their casters, spirits are linked to their masters, astrally projecting magicians are linked to their physical bodies, and foci and magical lodges are linked to the magicians who activated them. Awakened entities who are aware of these links can follow them and track them through the astral plane back to their sources.  Following an astral link requires an Assensing + Intuition (5, 1 hour) Extended Test, modified as noted on the Astral Tracking Modifiers table (p. 192)."
Shadowrun,3dfta1,Tyrhaynes,2,Thu Jul 16 12:35:58 2015 UTC,"Yes you combine the material link with an astral spotter. But you cant use Astral Tracking on the material link.   You use the material link to cast something at the target (from wich you have the DNA sample or whatever as a material link). So, you create an astral link (the spell that is targeted at the subject) and THAT can be followed by the astral spotter. As stated before, a material link is not an astral link. The spell wich you cast with the material link at your target has an astral link from caster to target."
Shadowrun,3dfta1,Tyrhaynes,2,Fri Jul 17 00:04:09 2015 UTC,You don't actually have to cast anything though. You just pump power into the ritual and follow the active magic. Takes a ritualist and an astral tracker though.

We've always used a whiteboard in previous campaigns, but now, I'm taking it to another level.   In the one-shot, the initiatives were kept on the whiteboard and all the names and such were written in wet erase. I then wrote the values (in dry erase) down beside the name, along with a number imarking the turn order. At the end of the action phase, we simply subtracted 10 and started again. After a turn, the dry erase was wiped away and started anew. It made it super easy to do.  I'm also going to be keeping other stuff on the board, like clues from legwork, bribes, names, etc...kind of like a heist movie."
Shadowrun,3dfkpk,shaninator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:56:52 2015 UTC,"A simple and easy solution is to use graph paper:  Make three different columns for meatspace, matrix and astral. The graph paper boxes form neat little rows that you can assign different values (I go for the full 1 box vertical = 1 iniative count, but you could save space with a 1:2 ratio or something instead if you wish). I put in a scale towards the left edge of the graph paper, usually I mark only every 5th or 10th iniative count. Write the scale and draw your columns with ink and then use pencil to write in people during combat. Erase names and put them in at a different count when appropriate.  It's not a perfect solution but it's easy and doesn't require much effort or cost. The biggest downside is that you end up having to replace the graph paper once every couple of combats as erasing takes a toll."

Shadowrun,3dfkpk,Newf77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"I'm still figuring this out myself. Being a programmer, my temptation is to handle it all with code, but so far just physical tokens seem to work pretty well. Stickies seem to work fine. One for each participant. Write down the character name at the top.  Each combat turn you write down the turn # and their roll on the character's sticky. Then sort from the stickies from highest to lowest score in a column.  With each initiative pass, I change initiative scores as the actions take place: I cross out their old initiative and write their adjusted score to its right. I usually don't worry about recording the accounting for simple & complex actions, because you can keep that in your head. Sometimes I do use a checkmark to indicate when a free action has been consumed; you could use another mark for a simple action and even complex action as well. I usually have another sticky for tracking delayed actions. Once a character has completed their actions for an initiative pass, I move them over to a new column (for the next initiative pass... if they still have any initiative left).  Usually I can use one sticky per character per fight. It does create a lot of paper waste, but it is very simple and visual enough that everyone knows when they can move and when they can't at a glance."

Shadowrun,3dg4hl,ACheddarMonk,5,Thu Jul 16 00:23:53 2015 UTC,"This problem is easily addressed... if you own a German printing of the book. But if you have an English printing, then it's pretty vague.  The German book expressly says that a device must be able to access the Matrix while attempting to change Ownership. Which means you can't just disable and hack away, nor can you hide out in a Faraday Cage.  Basically, Ownership is tying the settings in the device itself, into the Owner's profile on the Matrix. That's why they say an Owner always has 4 Marks on their devices. Even if you stole the Spider's Deck, if he goes and logs into another terminal somewhere, he can exercise full control over that Deck remotely. The device recognizes his Persona online and says ""Hey, I know you!"" And you have to be online in order to manifest your own Persona and convince the device ""Forget about that guy, this is the one you work for now.""  So yes, you could turn it off and wait. But when you inevitably turn it back on, the Icon will reappear on the Grid. If he sets up an Agent or something to keep scanning for the Icon, as soon as it appears he can start running Trace Icon to get your physical location. And then there's a knock at the door (if they're nice), or a gas grenade through the window / APDS rounds through the wall.  That's why stealing tech is bad for your health. =)"
Shadowrun,3dg4hl,marcus_gideon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:51:22 2015 UTC,"Yea, we went over this on another forum. I think the solution was to jack up your hardware pool into the 20s and then transfer ownership while the guy sleeps.  I noted that the rules don't actually say that you need to be in physical contact with the device to change ownership, so you could change ownership of a device while the owner still has it.  You probably need to be within 100 meters so that you're in direct connection to it.  Considering that the hardware test needs matrix access for some reason, and a good portion of the test is changing registrations on the grid, and even underwear is wireless, it is justifiable.  But the same guy that said you need to be always online said you need to be in physical possession.  Meh, the whole thing put me off datatrails."
Shadowrun,3dg4hl,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:43:56 2015 UTC,"It doesn't outright say you need to be touching it, but it is a Hardware check after all. Software is easy to manipulate remotely, but it's kinda tough to interact with physical components unless you're there. So I'd still say you need to have the device in hand.  Parts of the change may have to do with factory defaulting the device, which usually requires opening some special access port and pressing the button. Or maybe you're resetting the CMOS jumper on the motherboard."

Shadowrun,3dg4hl,jtsnemo,2,Thu Jul 16 11:19:29 2015 UTC,"There was a clarification that to change ownership the device had to be connected to the matrix the whole time.  For some balance reason, because I find it hard to fluff this to have any realistic cause.  Supposedly it's because ""ownership"" is stored in the device and in online databases - but why somebody couldn't hack the online databases at leisure and only turn the device on briefly to have them both sync up, I don't know.  So anyway, no, even a $500 Colt M-23  that you grabbed apparently has to be online the whole time your hardware guy is doing his (24,1hr) extended test, because ""fuck you"" :p  ED:  And even though there's no ""Computer"" related component to doing this.  I think if I owned something, I'd turn this ""feature"" off.  Because it sure seems like one consequence of this is to make it less risky to murder someone to steal something of his than to do it stealthily.  Who's not gonna be looking for his car?

Shadowrun,3dg4hl,gimlettio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:51:07 2015 UTC,"If you want a fluff reason: the corporations that constructed the Matrix made it that way on purpose so that they can have as much control as possible. They knew fully well the way they made it is convoluted and impractical and not very reasonable from the point of view of the average consumer but they did it anyway because they want to be able to actively monitor when things change ownership in the Matrix. This is also the reason that you can't turn off the change ownership feature: the corporations won't allow it, because they want to be in control."

If you get more hits on the spellcasting roll than your Magic attribute, the drain is physical. The force is the Limit for the spell, so you can't get more hits than the spell's force."

Shadowrun,3df27z,PinkTrench,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:51:09 2015 UTC,"In my games I emphasize that it is normal for Lone Star or Knight Errant to have a magical investigator for most magical crimes involving assault or murder.   Thus, mages are very careful about casting spells in high security areas that will involve them not having the time to wipe their astral signatures.  Corps are have psychometrists on call for analysis and access to astral photography.   If you cast a force 6 spell and used a force 4 focus that is a 10 total which is going to take a long time to fade away or wipe guaranteeing that any AA is going to have your signature on file.  Anonymity is a key component of most Shadowrun games and losing that can be a nightmare.   After the third or so magical crime of note with the same signature it is likely the police or corp will put a special investigator to task to find out more.  Thus, you have a fun adventure with the magician having to be the johnson and hope the team he hires can alter or remove all astral evidence or go to jail or worse. Or the magician has to initiate and learn masking posthaste. Again ready made plothook."

Most wire can support up to 400kg, which is roughly the equivalent of a lift and carry for a character with strength 27, so in my mind it can be as strong as the arm supports. Microwire is only rated for 100kg, which is roughly equivalent for a 7 strength character.   So if your grapple hand is loaded with microwire for some reason, I'd limit your strength stat to 7 for actions using it while it's deployed, but with any other wire it should be as strong as the rest of the arm.

You just can't start with anything over Avail 12 (there is a Quality that changes this, but otherwise 12 is standard). None of the melee weapons in the Core are above 12. And a Weapon Foci of Force <4 will have Avail 12. So you can start with typical melee weapons Force 3 or less. Anything higher needs GM approval at the table (or the Quality to allow higher Avail)."

Shadowrun,3dahvx,p3ndr4g0n,6,Wed Jul 15 07:38:12 2015 UTC,Horrors don't fit into a universe where dragons can own corporations or become president and spirits are conjured on a regular basis? The Universal Brotherhood was a major reason why Chicago is only just getting back on its feet and the repercussions are still eating away at Ares. I don't see how that's any less believable in this universe than an AI hijacking an arcology  and using the Matrix to create a cult of users without computer interfaces who still can interact with the Matrix. Shadowrun is not just one kind of story.
Shadowrun,3dahvx,Xarian0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with 'believable'. From a storytelling perspective, it is just a poor idea that eclipses the rest of the story: company breakups/mergers? Doesn't matter. CFD? Doesn't matter. Bug City? Doesn't matter. All that matters is that the horrors are going to come kill everyone.  It's the storytelling equivalent of ""rocks fall, everyone dies"". It's dumb, and it's very strongly against the major vein of what Shadowrun was about from the beginning (many stories, most pretty bleak, all important)."
Shadowrun,3dahvx,boobonk,4,Wed Jul 15 15:58:51 2015 UTC,"No, it wasn't. Maybe you're young. But a major part of what was going on in the world when the Horrors were written was that the Real World was dealing with the idea of something that could kill the whole world. And that seeped into everything in some way. That, and there needed to be something higher up the food chain than dragons and immortal elves. Something even they feared. And that group isn't going to be afraid of a tiny corporate merger. It was about introducing something to actually be afraid of."
Shadowrun,3dahvx,CaineHazen,3,Wed Jul 15 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"This . And they would almost never come into play. Even more rare than dragons.

Shadowrun,3dahvx,Paultagoras,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"""Actually be afraid of"" - runners and normal people have plenty of crap to be afraid of. Dragons, immortal elves, and other metaplanar beings have their own agendas that, frankly, are better off (story-wise) not being known.  The Horrors were just an example of this trope (link) - meaning that, hey, crazy dragons, diseases, and evil corporations are boring now so we're going to introduce something even bigger and eviler. It's lazy storytelling that causes people to very rapidly become disinterested in the world.  On the other hand, events like Deus, Crash 2.0, and the like are nasty, powerful events (not world-ending, but powerful) that are actually interesting.  That's why the Horrors never got brought back: because they're boring. Yes, big scary monsters coming to end the world. Because we haven't seen that already in almost literally every fantasy setting that exists.  As far as story progression, Shadowrun is better developed and more mature than Earthdawn. Even without the futuristic bent, it's just flat-out written better and it's more interesting. Keeping the ""all consuming evil"" in play just detracts from the other, more interesting stories, and I'm glad that they put the issue to rest with the Dragonheart.  I did like Big D, however, and it was unfortunate to see him go (at least in the flesh, so to speak)."

If you need some heavy firepower, a tank form-factor is already there (with added stability to boot), and if you need to access areas that are hard to reach, air is always an option.

I checked my runner just now and I had 1.70 WITH the Anti-holes, I removed them to see if they weren't working and that got me to 1.35, so it looks like at some point they stopped counting but removing them still sapped Essence.  Temporary stop gap, rating 70 Essence Anti-hole!"

If she DOES have a contact, that's better yet. A dealer with Loyalty 1-2 is an open liability, and can be bribed or threatened pretty easily into giving you up. Even a dealer who's a close friend is a weak point in a runner's armor.  A lot of the safety we get from the shadows comes from being inconspicuous. Ephemeral. Unpredictable.

Although the player drama was a little unnecessary.  If a player is stupid enough to punch through the side of the box just to get at the contents, they deserve whatever happens to them. Whether that's friendly retaliation, or getting eaten by a dragon.   And if that player gets up and storms off from the table, not only are you rid of them (they clearly aren't a team player) and you have room for a new member."
Shadowrun,3d98m8,marcus_gideon,2,Tue Jul 14 16:01:39 2015 UTC,Seriously. I wonder if the player would have been equally pissed off if the box had been a dirty nuke with a tamper failsafe and vaporized him.  Because for all he knew it was.
Shadowrun,3d98m8,PinkTrench,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:08:42 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I think it's pretty bad adventure design to put a pretty evident plot hook, ""DON'T LOOK IN THE BOOK"" out there, and then have following up on it resulting in the party automatically dying. That's my interpretation of what happened, anyway; they were faced with an impossible fight.   Suffering the consequences, sure. But, especially if it was known that the street samurai usually liked breaking things, it sounds like the DM baited them into a total party kill.   Not that I think that warrants rage-quitting with insults and such, but I'd be a bit annoyned if my DM, in any game, had a very likely party reaction result in a tpk."
Shadowrun,3d98m8,rollingForInitiative,2,Wed Jul 15 10:36:56 2015 UTC,still there is stupid and there is stupid. I don't think the GM expected one of the team to actually smash the box in order to break it open.

Shadowrun,3d98m8,Zorst,2,Wed Jul 15 13:03:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree it was stupid. But I still think it's generally bad design to have massive autokill scenarios, unless it's been heavily implied that that's the case.   I guess it sort of depends on the group, maybe that group didn't usually have issues with their characters dying left and right. Maybe they were all tired of their current characters and the DM knew this and knew they wouldn't mind a TPK. But I'm guessing there wouldn't have been drama then ...  Personally, if I played and that box had been smashed, I would've expected to have some serious repercussions. Maybe the dragon would've forced us into service as restitution. Maybe it would've hunted us and we'd have to escape, and would now have a new mortal enemy. It could've resulted in a lot of fun RP. Having an unbeatable opponent just crash the party and kill us all wouldn't really be my kind of fun, though."

Every time they come up with a covert run, the guy punches through the side of something, or kicks in the door with guns blazing. And the party just stands back and lets them act recklessly. So in this case, the GM punished the character for being reckless, and the party indirectly for standing back and letting it happen."

Shadowrun,3d98m8,randomaccount178,5,Tue Jul 14 18:57:10 2015 UTC,"I think the thing to remember is that most roleplaying games are systems of advancement, and as such while players do roleplay quite a bit, there is always that layer of metagaming looking to advance the character. Maybe taking a quest there isn't strictly speaking the best roleplay reason to, being loyal to a party member even when it doesn't make sense from your character background, and generally going out on adventures constantly is the best way to advance, for example like in D&D games. There is nothing wrong with that, but in systems like D&D where death can be more forgiving, people forget that the metagame for each game is going to be different, and the methodology that people take for granted is not going to work in every game you play.  When it comes to shadowrun, all the meta that you might of known from a d&d game goes out the window, because it is a game that can be very unforgiving. The primary trick to advancing in shadowrun is to not die, and anything that risks you dieing becomes a liability. When you switch over from one system to another where the meta is so different, it can come off as a real shock because it feels like players are working against their best interests to harm you. What it really is though, is you not realizing that they are working in their best interests and you are in fact harming them. It is a change in the metagame, and if people are not prepared for it, and adjust their playing to account for it, then it can cause a bumpy ride and feelings of betrayal."
Shadowrun,3d98m8,CristolGDM,3,Tue Jul 14 15:42:38 2015 UTC,"Note that whether or not the game is unforgiving depends a lot on the GM. Shadowrun has a reputation for lethal stories, and so new GMs try to tell lethal stories too, but the game itself is not limited to them, you can definitely GM a game of Heroics & Explosions with no issues"
Shadowrun,3d98m8,randomaccount178,2,Tue Jul 14 16:30:20 2015 UTC,"Even so the dynamic still tends to be different, D&D often times rewards effort. You get rewarded for every success, even if its part of an overall failure. Shadow run seems like it doesn't reward effort, only overall success. 90% of your plan could go off perfectly, then everything fails and you don't get payed. It changes the dynamic quite a bit, even if you make your games not very deadly."
Shadowrun,3d98m8,-Pin_Cushion-,6,Tue Jul 14 16:53:25 2015 UTC,"Even so the dynamic still tends to be different   How to make any RPG into a ""Shadowrunny"" setting.  1) Start with a simple assignment, such as ""Go get me that thing.""  2a) To make it D&D add a bunch of magical, world-threatening stuff.  ""If you don't get me that thing demons will o'ertake the land!""  2b) To make it Shadowrunny ensure the thing is as bland and uninteresting sounding as possible.  Sometimes the thing is even a person!  ""I'll pay you to bring back that thing, but it's just a box that FedEx forgot to pick up...""  3) Make the place the thing lives be completely out of character for the apparent importance of the thing.  ""It's just a boring old box...in a heavily guarded warehouse...that I have to hire anonymous criminals to infiltrate...""  4) Ensure the quest-giver leaves out important information.  ""The thing doesn't actually belong to me, and if you drop it or open it a nuclear explosion will probably result.  Also, the actual owner knows I've hired you so the guard will be doubled and expecting you.""  5) Make sure someone double-crosses someone.  ""I decided that hiring another team to murder you was cheaper than paying you.""  6) Make sure someone else double-crosses someone.  ""The guy I'm stealing from hired a team to murder me, but is so angry that he no longer cares about that thing you guys stole.""  7) About 75% of the time, make sure the party actually gets paid by the guy that hires them and just have some nobody double-cross them instead.

Ya, a Flesh Form should look totally realistic."
Shadowrun,3da4wj,dezzmont,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"The only time someone will ""see"" your aura is if they are Astral Perceiving, Astral Projecting, or using some kind of spell. If they are physically aware (Perceiving or spell based) then they can clearly tell you are a dude, not a Force 8 Spirit.  About the only time looking like a Spirit would even remotely pass, would be if you were Projecting to some remote location that had a bunch of Spirits already, and you wanted to blend in with the locals.  Otherwise, the benefit to Masking isn't for looking like something else, but rather for looking like a mundane, or some a really insignificant street performer instead of a powerful Archmage."

They tell everybody ""No Magic."" Place a few watchers in the plane, and if the ban is broken you get put on a Terrorist ""no Fly"" list. They do not drug, hood, or handcuff mages, simply for flying on a plane. The background count of just below orbit (sub-orbitals) and space (ballistic) are generally enough discouragement. Ballistic flights are rare enough and expensive enough, that they might actually put wagemages on those, if they could find any that would risk permanent insanity from going into space and looking astrally into the nothingness."

SIN scanners are top of the line and nearly impossible to fool. All weapons will be checked (don’t even think about explosives) and all cyberware must be deactivated.  Sub-orbitals are slightly slower, slightly cheaper, and slightly easier to infiltrate. Slightly. Sub-orbital passengers are usually megacorporate clients, and the corps want them to feel safe. Security is tight, and violations will be dealt with harshly.  Regular air travel is for regular people. Security is present, but quality varies from provider to provider; if your fake SIN and forged documentation are good enough you should do fine. Depending.   Basically, yeah. Unless you're (somehow) able to fool them into thinking you don't have anything of concern, they will shut it down, lock it up, and err on the side of caution. This is if you're not flying some kind of megacorp private express jet reserved for their wagemages and security teams.   If you're flying public air, your right to be an unimpeded person of mass destruction is as important to Security as things like your civil liberties and privacy.

Shadowrun,3d87ed,jre2,2,Fri Jul 17 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"On a semi-ballistic flight mages can run into problems because of Background Count and lack of mana. At a certain point in flight it can be so dangerous to astrally perceive that it can harm or kill a mage. For flights there is nothing I've seen about anything positive or negative.   I had a player in a game once who was hired to assassinate a powerful independent businessman who was an hidden ghoul and also an hidden initiate mage with masking. The Johnson didn't even know this but the team figured it out after some really smart investigations and one of those miracle rolls that usually happen when nothing really important is going on.  Anyway, they set up a situation that required a very rushed target having to get on a semi-ballistic flight as soon as possible to get where he needed to go.   So, anyway ghouls are dual natured so they are astrally perceiving all the time and the target didn't have time to read or listen to any of the warnings and didn't bring the drugs many awakened people take to sleep through the space part of the trip.  Needless to say it was the perfect assassination."
Shadowrun,3d87ed,Tyrhaynes,3,Tue Jul 14 08:13:31 2015 UTC,"My best guess would be mandatory sedation, as most people would be okay sleeping through a flight anyway and it is relatively inexpensive.

I'm not sure if planes fly high enough, but there is a negative background count that grows the farther you get from the gaiasphere (which extends up to about 80 km from the surface of the earth). Space is a scary place for magic users. EDIT- Yeah normal passenger planes won't be going much higher than 12km so not likely going to be of consequence.  You could have a couple aspected mages who do nothing but counterspell serving as air marshals of a sort I suppose.  I don't believe you could put a specific background count on a plane as it is a moving object (but remember to consider that there may be foveae along the flight path for whatever reason, which definitely wouldn't be a security feature obviously).   That's pretty much everything I can quickly think of that might be applicable, but there are certainly more methods out there."

In Shadowrun you have semi-ballistic flights, which is essentially an airplane slung at high speeds into the air on a path that will briefly take it to the edge of the atmosphere before gravity takes over and brings it back down again.

Some cybered up people refuse to turn off their 'ware. They're offered sleeping pills (I mean, narcoject apparently has no downsides in the setting unless in really rare cases).

Second most mages know zero combat spells, combat mages are the exception rather than the rule.   Besides, if a mage really wanted to start some shit on a plane they could just bind a few spirits and give them orders to find the plane after it takes off and assist them.   I've said it before and I'll say it again, magic/mages are very hard to protect against and that is only reason people really give a shit about them. A flamethrower spell and an actual flamethrower aren't much different, its just that a dude with a flamethrower is pretty damn easy to spot and protect against compared to the Mage."

Shadowrun,3d87ed,ChromeEagle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:34:43 2015 UTC,I think there are 2 things you are overlooking and overcomplicating the matter entirely.   Damage the fusalage and you compromise an air pressured cabin. Probably not smart and given that it would almost certainly result in the demise of the team. The only thing a mage hates worse than running in australia is running into another mage. FAA likely has a Wage mage on board every flight just to neutralize Magical Terrorists. Not to mention the other traveling mages (maybe 1 or 2 per flight) and the other 100 or so passengers that act in self preservation. Act out and you might as well dig your own plot in the ground. Nobody wants the plane to turn into a burning crater and will do anything to make sure the flight goes smooth.
Shadowrun,3d87ed,Trickybiz,2,Tue Jul 14 08:42:51 2015 UTC,"Considering how many flights they'll have and how rare mages are, I really doubt they have the man power for a mage on every flight (after all there's a reason spirits tend to patrol buildings or mages astrally patrol several, instead of having a mage posted at every corp building). Having an occasional flight with a mage (due to important cargo or passenger) is definitely a thing though.  Your first point is spot on though."

There's no astral space there, so no magic. Problem solved.  As for taking the magic away: Magemask is a common solution. Makes the mage blind and fills his head with a constant buzzing that makes concentrating impossible. Drugs are way simpler and cheaper tho. Just send the mage to sleep and he won't cast spells."

Dunk was aware of an ancient magical threat called The Horrors that humanity's crazy abuse of magic in recent years was about to unleash.  Typically in the past, the world was a bit better prepared for their arrival.  Big D sacrificed himself to create a magical doodad of immense power called The Dragon Heart and in so doing, ripped a hole into the fabric between the astral and physical worlds where he died.  (He also used the opportunity to settle about a million and a half old scores and shake up the world pretty extensively.) He made it look like an assassination so that The Horrors wouldn't immediately realize what was going on.  His death absolutely occurred and was not faked, merely the method of his death.

However, all the appropriate modifiers still apply:   NPC attitude to PC: Between Suspicious and Hostile (-1 to -3). [You're wearing heavy duty combat armor, so suspicious would be very generous. A KE cop would assume you are armed accordingly. I'd go with hostile.] Character's desired result: Harmful (-3) or Disastrous (-4) to NPC. [Walking away will get that cop demoted or fired. Note that this modifier is about what the cop subjectively assumes would happen.] Street Reputation: 0. [You are trying to pretend you are not yourself. The faceless hostage situation cop doesn't have a rep even if you do.] Subject has ""Ace of the Hole"": 0 [You don't] Character has plausible seeming evidence: 0 [You're wearing generic combat armor, not a KE uniform issue with corp tags.] Subject is distracted: 0 to +1 [This one depends on the rest of the scenario.] Subject has time to evaluate the situation: 0 to -1 [I'd rule -1 because the KE guy wouldn't have approached a guy in heavy combat armor without calling it in or checking your broadcasts.]   That combines to something between -4 and -8. The suit is chemically sealed, so tailored pheromones don't apply. That's quite a check.  Frankly though, that'd work once at my table. Tops. IF the cop just happens to see you. Chances are he was called by some scared sob because of ""the guy in combat armor"". In that case his first reply is: ""Bullshit, there's no hostage situation here."" because he checked with dispatch before he even approached you. And that's just one of the many elephant sized holes in the story. KE cops likely broadcasts their badge numbers on a KE only channel. Asking for it raises eyebrows. Trying to keep a cop from calling dispatch is a red flag because it assumes that the runners can actually listen in on the matrix communication of KE. They aren't using radios like cops do today. KE guys also don't work alone. While you try to talk one out of calling dispatch, the other is recording everything you do with his internal helmet camera and has dispatch on the line while you are talking to his buddy. Worse though, KE guys don't work alone. You are and they can see that. That's not even touching the fact that your armor and gear isn't standard issue.  KE is kind of a substitute for whatever territory you're on at the time. The problem is that the kind of armor you're wearing is close enough to something the given security would wear to stand out as not having the right markings. That creates instant suspicious because the type of armor is a threat in itself."

Shadowrun,3d5nsx,EyeSavant,2,Tue Jul 14 05:30:37 2015 UTC,"Well there is always narcojet darts. Needs 3 net hits vs armoured target, then it is 15s damage resisted by body and willpower only.  Against a surprised target that is pretty easy. Gets harder vs someone who sees it coming, but not impossible, would need some optimisation towards smartlink dart rifle (low accuracy is bit of problem). Unlikely the tank is going to have too many defense dice though.  Then stunbolt is spellcasting + magic vs willpower, net hits as stun damage. Can also be done via a mirror around a corner, or via fibre-optics. Could easily get 21 dice out of chargen for stunbolt. 7 Magic, 6 ranks, 2 specialisation.  2 mentor spirit, 4 focus.  Spirit envelop, then fly 100m into the air and drop is also a fun one. See how well you soak 100p damage. I guess more than 30m (about as far as a F6 spirit of air can move in one turn) is tough, that is still 30p damage, 40 dice will soak a lot of it, but it is still likely fatal. Engulf (just needs a net hit) then move 36m (F6 spirit of air sprinting) straight up can be done in one pass RAW, as movement is not an action. Then the tank likely escapes, but its a long way down."

Getting the 3 net hits for a dart vs an armoured target is not trivial unless they don't see you coming. Going from needing 3 net hits to 0 net hits is huge.  Means I wasted some cash and karma on my current char, but not that much :D. Edit :: Actually I guess a dart pistol is a lot quieter so maybe not wasted :D, the silent takedown on a target who does not see you coming was the point anyway :D.  Had not realised how much fun pepper punch could be as well. Power 11, resisted by body and willpower. If final power is more than target's willpower they get to spend 3 turns doing nothing but throw up. Get shot by a few people with pepper punch capsule rounds and the end of the next combat turn most armour builds are going to be in trouble."

Shadowrun,3d5nsx,Shakyor,4,Sun Jul 19 17:43:26 2015 UTC,I once set off to see just how high you can push Initiative. I think I got up to ~30 + 5d6 initiative for an average of 47 Initiative in meatspace. I actually think I pushed the average to 52 but I'll have to find my old notes to be sure. This is in 5th btw.
Shadowrun,3d5nsx,SK_Ren,2,Tue Jul 14 00:48:04 2015 UTC,I gotta see how you managed that.
Shadowrun,3d5nsx,xcbsmith,2,Tue Jul 14 05:05:33 2015 UTC,"Intuition based mage with high edge and reaction for example can do this pretty easy. Just cast increased intuition, reaction and vastly overcast improved reflexes. BOOM"
Shadowrun,3d5nsx,xcbsmith,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:19:07 2015 UTC,"Looking at my old notes I believe I had an Wakyambi with maxed Reaction 7, Intuition 5 in any combination for a base 12+1d6 Initiative. From here we have options:     Synaptic Boosters are the worst way to get our remaining +4d6 initiative dice as they are incompatible with everything meaning we are stuck with +4d6 and can't reach +5d6. You'll be using Psyche and Increase Attribute[Intuition] to hit the Augmented maximum for Intuition. Wired Reflexes is number one in potential stats, but number two due to feasability. Get a good firewall and go wireless with Reaction Enhancers for a potential +6 Reaction if you have the money. It's also compatible with Magical enhancements to initiative and drugs so you can use Cram/Jazz or an Increase Initiative spell to get that last Dice. You only need two hits. You can then try to max out your Intuition with a combination of Psyche and an Increase Attribute spell. I would suggest getting a teammate to cooperate. You only need a minimum of 3 hits at Force 5 to max out. Improved Reflexes is first. It's incompatible with everything except drugs, so you can at least hit +5d6 total dice with this option if you don't mind being an addict to Cram or Jazz. However it is much easier to hit your Augmented caps for Reaction/Intuition, despite WR/RE giving you +2 net bonus over this option, this is much more achievable in the short run. Same as before you'll be using Psyche and Increase Attribute[Intuition] to hit the Augmented maximum.   This all results in the following Initiative stats assuming we've maxed our stats in all three cases:   Synaptic Boosters: 19+4d6 Initiative; 33 Average, 43 max Wired Reflexes: 25+5d6 Initiative; 42.5 Average, 55 Max Improved Reflexes: 20+5d6 Initiative; 37.5 Average, 50 Max   So I was wrong about breaking 50 average. I think that was before I realized the Augmented Max was +4 and not 50% of your natural maximum like in 4E.  Of course if you've broken the game and can cast infinitely powerful spells, just cast a super powerful Increase Initiative instead. 10 Hits gives you a whopping +10+5d6 Initiative. Get your hands on a F10 sustaining focus, max your Counterspell skill, paint yourself blue and go fast."
Shadowrun,3d5nsx,xcbsmith,2,Tue Jul 14 12:12:38 2015 UTC,"Improved Reflexes is first.   Not at all. Max bonus without drugs is +3+3d6 that way, and you can only boost Reaction for 1 more point.  Number 1 for non-spell lift is: Adrenaline Boost 7 gives you +14, which is slightly better than Improved Reflexes average of +13.5, you aren't incompatible with anything (though things might be incompatible with Adrenaline Boost) and you still can boost your Reaction & Intuition by 4 each and have +4d6 left on the table. Only downside is it lasts for only one combat turn.  Number 1 overall is Increased Reflexes. If you go with Force 8, you can get +8+4d6, and you haven't boosted your Reaction yet, so you can still get 4 more points from Reaction and you aren't incompatible with anything except another Increased Reflexes spell.  Both together and you are +22+4d6, and you can still fully boost Reaction and Intuition."

Force 8 gives us a shot at 4.5 more points on average). Maximum is 40 + 30 = 70. That's typically 6-7 actions per combat turn. Now, after that first turn, you lose thrill seeker, adrenaline boost and take some nasty drain (painful, but not deadly), but since you just got 6-7 initiative passes off... is there any more combat left?  Now, that is if you are human. If you go with a Satyr or a Wakyambi, you get another point from attributes. If you go with a Pixie you can get 3 more. Technically with Force 8 Increase Reflexes, you have a shot at a >71 initiative so you can get 8 attacks per round even as a human. ;-)  While for raw Reaction scores, a Satyr Exceptional Attribute and wireless Wired Reflex + Reaction Enhancers is the king, the magic of adrenaline boost cannot be ignored. ;-)"

(No time limit given, so whatever you can safely do at full health + max buffs, which means like Force 10 (? - not doing the math).)  You easily have 7 of them from 7 CHA at chargen. Then cast Magic Fingers with Edge + Aid Sorcery. Who cares what force they were, you're still getting your DP + 7*F dice rolling. Conservatively, thats 12 + 7*7 = 61, with some buffs thats 20 + 7*10 = 90 dice. Thats not even the max you can go, but you get the idea. So, thats 30 hits, on average, not counting exploding sixes (which would probably be another 5-7 hits). So you have Magic Fingers with Strength and Agility of 30+.  Now sustain that and swing a big stick.  OR quicken it and let the fun continue.  Basically, repeat the whole shebang with Analyze Device on your weapon of choice for more additional dice using your weapon than most munchkins have in their entire dicepool.

If you're in a game that only allows lottery winners to play, it's ridiculous to try to find reasons that you weren't a lottery winner ""it's so unliiiiikely!"".

Not that I don't understand how brutal and usually fatal combat can be - but it's perfectly acceptable to get into a lot of fights if you know you've got the upper hand. You're not always fighting Ares corpsec, or Yakuza enforcers. Most of the hostiles on the street are simpletons, minor gangers or feral ghouls. It's perfectly fine to have a combat heavy run, as long as you're realistic and don't get in over your head.  Also, from an out-of-char perspective, lots of PCs are optimized for combat and they'll need spotlight time. Knocking out the dwarf guard and tying him up in one fell (initiative-free) swoop might feel awesome for the infiltrator or the face, but the street sam wants to fight. Let him!"

Shadowrun,3d3c0g,TempusFrangit,3,Mon Jul 13 07:57:58 2015 UTC,"The problem is that upon releasing something, people generally like it and are tolerant of mistakes because it's new. If you then do nothing, people will start complaining that the game lacks content, new rules should be added and existing rules should be fine tuned or fixed.   Then you start updated your rules, releasing new books and updating the game. That's when people start complaining who think the game is going into a different direction than they would like. At this stage you can't do anything right, because no matter which route you go there's going to be some players who like it, and others who don't. While Shadowrun for instnace may be quite plagued with editing mistakes, there are enough complaints that are unrelated to that.  Then you decide to update the core rules and release a new edition. This is a large and fundamental change, so you can bet your ass that people are not going to like it. However, those are also the people who are complaining about the current edition because the 60+ addon books make the game bloated. Look at D&D for instance: every new edition people complain that it's not 2nd edition enough or even 3rd edition enough. Even when 5th edition was announced people were complaining despite the eventual release being quite good and well received.  It's not just pen & paper roleplaying games. It's in comics (very dominantly, actually - it's more common to read about what comicbook fans do not like than what they do like), movies (Star Wars is a big one here), games (where people shout, demand, and cry when a sequel is announced, but then criticize pretty much everything about it), politics, and so on.

EDIT: The best way to put it is Dumpshock has a lot of people that love Shadowrun but hate Catalyst.

Take Skilljacks for example. In Chrome Flesh, they're half the cost and their availability drops to the point that you can get Rating 6 at chargen, presumably because they realised that nobody was actually using them. No errata for that, no preface of 'Hey guys, this stuff is different to what's in the core book intentionally, it's not one of our numerous unintentional editing fuckups'.

Is it really that hard to go up to whoever is in control of the errata document and say 'So, about those skilljacks. We fucked up, yeah? How about we put out something in an errata that reduces the prices?'   Is there some Matrix Metaplanar Quest you need to undertake for it?"

I imagine that the Rigger book will change the price of some drones and cars as well, to bring everything into a more unified system.

Shadowrun,3d3c0g,Roxfall,3,Tue Jul 14 03:34:08 2015 UTC,"You can like the game despite not liking specifics of the rules or book formatting.  A lot of people I hear like the setting and the fluff. Some don't like the rules that come with it (too complex, or too imprecise); some do like the rules, but think there are some serious problems with them (unclear rules, contradictions, etc.). Some don't like the quite poor editing of the books. Those are all valid reasons to complain, especially for a game you care about. And all those complains have some merit (although not liking the rules is a subjective problem).  If you're in the forums dealing with clearing up confusions, you're going to read the discussions where they discuss the confusing or parts of the rules and other problems, and those are usually the ones people complain the most in."
Shadowrun,3d3c0g,McBoobenstein,3,Mon Jul 13 08:28:48 2015 UTC,"In my experience one of the most common opinions you encounter in the wider RPG community when it comes to Shadowrun is: ""I love the setting, and it's a really cool game, but I just can't stand the system.""

Hook: The warden knows his operation is coming to an end and is in the middle of closing up shop. He was planning on inciting a prison riot to cover his tracks but if the runners are found out, he'll switch to blaming them to cover his tracks.   Sinker: The Johnson is posing as a investigative reporter but in reality was hired either by Lone Star (to verify rumors and if need be 'quietly retire' the warden) or Knight Errant (to use as leverage to pry the remaining bits of Lone Star out of the city). It's up to the GM to decide.   But as soon as the job is done, the opposing faction that hired the Johnson starts to hound the runners to reveal any dirt that they may have dug up to use."

""You, you are runner, yes? You give back to community! You watch store while I go to my wedding. I be back in two hours. You just watch store, stop shoplifters, yes? Back in three hours. Four hours, top."" Then he leaves the runners in charge of his store while he goes away.  The twist: An hour later a heavily armed gang comes to the store demanding their monthly protection payments, which they customarily take by more or less looting half the store. These are the ""shoplifters"" the owner was talking about.  I've had this setup lying around for a rainy day for a while now.

After a few mins HTR shows up (even if no alarm was sounded) but at a normal rating (aka as tough as expected, not the blue milk run up to that point)  Twist: the whole thing is a setup to film the very show they were sent to steal, hidden wireless cams record all sorts of angles of the ""daring infiltration' for later editing, HTR was genuine to give the episode a dramatic finish where the corps are shown to be better than any opposition such a dangerous criminal can provide  The Johnson will still pay any surviving team, thanking them for supplying the footage for the best episode yet (he might deduct any lethal damage costs from his fee though)"

Imagine the runners then being hired to ""Attack"" different places or perform extractions with maybe an embedded rigger (implanted camera and camera drones that second as combat drones.)  Or the team rigger is given what's necessary.    Then they become famous, and that has repercussions of it's own.  That could be quite fun, especially if the players weren't in on the campaign idea from the start.  Make cash readily available and maybe even some gear easy to get (sponsored, of course. This Frag Grenade brought to you by Ares.)  They'll want to stay on the free crap train for as long as possible.    When they want new cyber or whatever, make them make hard choices: the character's new Agent says, ""Um, I know you want that muscle Aug, but Ares wants to get their new Gemini model Cyberarm some visibility this month and since it's sweeps week we'll be every where.

However if you are looking for basics to them ease into additional content, 5E has benefits.  The main differences are in character generation. 4E has a BP build (among others) as its default system. much like point buy systems for d&d only for more than just stats. 5E uses the priority system. you classify what priorities are most important for your character between: Stats, Gear, Skills, Magic, & Race.  A difference from Shadowrun from D&D is the lack of levels. You spend experience to build up your stats & skills to improve rather than straight linear boosts from levels.  I suggest playing as a PC before jumping into GMing Shadowrun, to see how you want to run the game. 2 major concepts are episodic & campaign, though you can mix them. Episodic is as it suggests, runs are like episodes in a TV series mini groupings not always connected to each other. Campaign is more like D&D, a developed plot with everything following along it.  If you must jump into GMing right away, I suggest starting with Food Fight (a premade run) or Shadowrun Missions."

When choosing an edition to play or find a game for knowing preferences & baseline generation can be important,  especially on a site like roll 20 where shadowrun games are already scarce. someone who prefers BP generation may have better luck finding a 4a game since its the default rather than a 5e bp gen game. same would go for those who prefer priority, easier to find a 5e game using it than 4a.

Shadowrun,3d1pnv,bralgreer,2,Mon Jul 13 03:53:46 2015 UTC,"Do you want to play Cops being Cops, Cops being Robbers, or Cops being fed up and being vigilantes at night.  I would dig the last one. Kind of a Gangster Squad meets Person of Interest feel."
Shadowrun,3d1pnv,PinkTrench,2,Sun Jul 12 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"I just finished up a Lonestar campaign. It was fun to play, but suffered from a few problems. The main one was that a police force has a specific hierarchy, which leads to people wanting to know what their superior wants them to do and cuts down on a lot of player autonomy. In addition to that your character has to deal with limitations on actions from being a law-abiding citizen. Also, as with any mystery adventure your GM needs to script the investigation so that there are backup clues you can bring in when the players completely miss what's going on and have no clue where to go next. Doing that without letting the players know you're just handing it to them can be tricky if you're not prepared.   It's not all bad though, we had a good time with it, and it's kind of fun seeing the world of Shadowrun from the other side of the badge. Plus you have the option of calling in HTR on your side for once.   You can listen to our game by becoming a Patron of the  Arcology Podcast."
Shadowrun,3d1pnv,lshiva,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:24:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's a good point - this was actually a driving factor since the last campaign I ran suffered from players asking ""well, what now?"" and constantly needing a guiding voice to check if they were ""doing the right thing"". However, it's important not to make them feel railroaded, or dependent - I'll have to keep that in mind."
Shadowrun,3d1pnv,Feynt,2,Sun Jul 12 22:39:41 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of scenarios where the PCs aren't 'runners but are something else:  Corpsec, Lodge mages, Atlantean explorers, cops, mafia goons, hell straight up gangers and even bouncers.  One of my long past groups actually had a family thing going where they ran a nightclub as a cover for their gun collection.  They did private jobs still, as runners do, but strictly on a ""do-gooder"" basis and often ended up giving up monetary rewards (though keeping the stuff the bad guys had was always fun for them).  The cops never bothered them because hardly anyone died and the scum kept showing up in incriminating and utterly compromised situations, which made throwing very large books at them very easy.  The important part is having a story plotted out, at least in a bread crumb sort of fashion.  You can't say ""great, you're all cops!"" and that's that.  Nobody likes the Star Trek:  TOS ""everything's resolved by the end of the session"" style of story for long.  Look at a lot of different investigation squads.  What makes this group special among all others?  Is this a cyber division who handles jacked up gangers and high profile cases (Ghost in the Shell style perhaps)?  Is this a magic division who tracks down dangerous individuals or phenomenon in the name of public safety (""Stay back or you'll get sucked into the astral plane!""  ""Oh Gods, the mages are warping reality again, run!"")?  Are they beat cops who stumbled onto something big that might shake up the power structure of the region, or even their precinct, like their chief being on the take for some local (or worse, international) mob boss?  It's just as nuanced as if they were runners, but you have the added boundaries of ""for the public good"" to worry about.  This is good because it gives you and them reasonable guidelines to work from (don't shoot first and ask questions later, avoid hurting civies, innocent until proven guilty, police brutality laws, etc.), and a reasonable expectation of performance (help clean up the streets and protect the innocent) from each of the scenarios you throw at them.  That is, assuming they'll stay cops.  Sometimes it's impossible to nail a crime on someone.  They're just so masterfully set up that anything you try to nail them with they just ooze around.  Sometimes the desire to do good overrides a paycheque, and you'll see them go rogue, maybe even turn to the shadows after all, just to get that scum bag off the streets.  The wonderful thing about players is they don't always live up to expectations."
Shadowrun,3d1pnv,Dallico,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:25:27 2015 UTC,"This is good stuff to consider, thanks. It's going to be a real problem if some PCs decide to go vigilante and others stay straight, I'll need to make sure I write contingencies.   The plan was to have both beat-cop work to do to keep the streets clean and an overarching line of runs to solve the murder of a collective friend. I've played in campaigns where there were multiple 'objective groups' like this, and it made deciding which runs to take a really important (and fun) decision, because the world state would change depending on what we accepted (and by omission refused), so I'm hoping to recreate this for my players."
Shadowrun,3d1pnv,gimlettio,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:45:47 2015 UTC,"I find it will follow different rules. For instance, if I were to run a corpsec game or a police game the basic rules would need to change. Regulations would control what gear they can use at any given time much like any officer in the modern day. Not only that, they wouldn't be paid for a job, they'd get paid like the day job table, among other things. Playing a game as official officers is going to be a challenge, however being a 'consultant' for the police force is a perfectly acceptable shadowrun, because, despite what people think, there are definitely plenty of precincts that will hire out runners to do their dirty work."
Shadowrun,3d1pnv,ElevatedUser,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:34:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, my first thought would be to fluff the ""pay"" as being actually a measure of influence or favors or something.  So ""job pays 10k"" isn't strictly nuYen, it's ""you've done a high enough profile job for the police armorer to wink when you pick up a non-regulation weapon and your superiors to look the other way"".  Or get more detailed than that, make a separate system that tracks influence with different departments/factions - just because you've pulled the wool over your immediate superior's eyes doesn't cut any ice with Internal Affairs or the DA's staff..."
Shadowrun,3d1pnv,VoroSR,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"It's not just pay that needs adjustments, it's qualities too.  For example, everyone would have a SIN (probably a corporate one), which isn't worth any more points. Day Job too, like you say. There are probably some other NQ's that either don't apply, are manditory, or are prohibitive.  I think the best way to handle pay is much like gimletto said in the other reply. You get a basic wage (enough to cover whatever lifestyle is appropriate for the level of your player's characters - maybe a bit less to keep the stress there). On top of that, you get extra ""nuyen"" to spend on gear. That's not actual money you get, but once you get enough you get to requisition a piece of gear from the boss. The two income streams don't cross."
Shadowrun,3d1pnv,milesunderground,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:15:08 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest doing it as ""straight"" shadowrunners. They did the street level thing for a bit, but then turned straight as ""contracters"" for a precinct or three. They're bound by the law - and have some dispensations under it - but still get paid a per-contract rate and have some operational freedom. You do that, you should be golden."
Shadowrun,3d1pnv,Hobbes2073,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:38:07 2015 UTC,"I've played corp sec/cop Shadowrun and it's been a lot of fun. It's a little different from standard SR, but I've never found it unworkable.  It helps to make the group an autonomous unit, something like the cops on The Shield (for a morally gray game) or The Closer (for a more traditional ""good guys"" campaign).  If something high profile comes up they can be tasked with solving it, but they're also expected to make cases and pursue their own investigations.    Also the idea that cop PC's have to play by the rules skips the point that most corporations (law enforcement or otherwise) are to some degree corrupt.  PC cops will have to make the call how far over the line they want to go."

That held till somewhere in the stratossphere, and from there on it was quasi-freefall untill a few kilometres above ground, when it was time for parachutes.  EDIT: Skeleton of a landing capsule, of course, not a human skeleton oO  This was in third edition, there were no rules for low gravity, stats for spacesuits or stuff like that, so we had to make it all up on our own, which definitely helped with the awesome factor."

They were told the software was going to be a worm that would work it's way through the assorted missiles and scrap out the guidance of the whole missile armory.    Anyway, during the infiltration a large insect spirit queen from a couple runs back decides to show up.  Much carnage and chaos ensues, the whole missile silo is strewn with bodies and bugs and the runners manage to get the chip in.    Of course the missiles launch.   ""Luckily"" the Japanese imperial navy is on Joint maneuvers in the Black Sea with the Georgian navy and manage to destroy the missiles on the ascent.  The same force happens to have a large amphibious assault contingent.  Said force quickly moves across Georgia and begins to ""stabalize"" the region.  Iran and some of the other local powers get in on the ""stabalization"" action while the Japanese forces stare down the forces the Russians had managed to mobilize.    In the mean time, the runners have no idea about what happened with the missiles.  The Queen Spirit is still on the loose, and the Runners realize they've been screwed hard.

Downtown was locked down for 24 hours.

What we didn't know is that the target was larger than a massive troll and he was a ghoul that had about 9 or 10 points of cyberware, an assault rifle and a katana.   My character was a covert ops specialist that specialized in melee. I was forced to resort to my pistol out of sheer fear of engaging him head on. He nearly wiped our group of 3 out but luckily none of us went down. It was INTENSE and I was in shock and fear. He had a bunch of other ghouls with him as well.

Shadowrun,3d0f9a,z3r0gamer,4,Mon Jul 13 19:50:28 2015 UTC,"(Always a GM, never a runner...  sigh)  Probably my favorite was having my players hijack a Japanese Imperial corvette patrol ship, then sell it to Masaru for his revolution.  I set up the run as a simple hand-off;  meet some Filippino smugglers in international waters, pick up the cargo, get it back safely.  One of my players was running a half-Filippino black magician with ties to the revolution.  They get to the coordinates, only to see a massive storm on the horizon;  it seems our smugglers are being pursued by Japanese Navy, and their crew magician has summoned a monster Great Air spirit to cover their escape.  A few lightning strikes later and the Navy's communications and sensors are burnt-out scrap and the magician is near dead from drain.  Now, it was never mentioned that this was the real prize, but I knew my players' greed.  They couldn't resist a boarding action, followed by a blitzkrieg raid across the deck to take the helm.  At that point in the game, we had been playing for close to a year, and we're approaching prime runner status, but needed a big, dangerous payday to really earn the upgrade.  Long story short, they captured the captain and the ship, executed about half the crew, and handed it over to Masaru for a large, non-negotiable payday.  Who else were they going to sell a hijacked, multi-billion nuyen military asset to?  :D"
Shadowrun,3d0f9a,Daihatschi,3,Sun Jul 12 20:17:18 2015 UTC,"I was playing a Technomancer a long time ago in 4E. Our job was to steal a prototype piece of medical equipment from a remote research lab loosely affiliated with DocWagon before torching said facility. We were planning out our attack whilst gathering information when we discovered that the guard in the tower had a hobby. Namely, shooting prairie dogs. Which he had to step outside to do. We'd gotten a floor plan already and were working on our entrance strategy when this happened. Our mage created an illusion of a prairie dog to mess with him, and then we had the idea.  We could plant a minor mental suggestion in his mind to chuck his cardkey over the fence from his guard tower.  The mage did so, and the team stormed the place. Someone yelled something about the alarm, which was when I realized what I had forgotten to check on.  With no time to go, I threaded a Force 10 Crack Sprite and had it spoof the normal signals from the communications uplink, rather than just cut them off. It being a Force 10 Sprite, the giant Matrix dragon curled up on the comms antenna like Smaug himself, and I told him to keep it up for as many days as I had tasks; namely, 3.  Our street sam and sniper went to town with the pepper punch and plain old everyday punch, we rolled everyone up in Saran wrap and got them out of the local area entirely, and blew the place sky-high. Then we got out of there and called emergency services to get the Saran-wrapped unconscious scientists and other employees.  Three days later DocWagon learns about the run and one of our group members, who still has contacts there from her time as a paramedic, gets a call from one of those contacts that basically amounts to ""do you believe this drek?"" She poker-faced it through the call and then started dying of laughter."

After that we found out that the guy hiring us actually works for that company, and didn't get his promotion to chief of security.  We were pissed and asked ourselves whether to go home of go big.  We went big ! Really Big ! We said to ourselves, he wants a distraction? A Loud Noise?

Only the one that pass through a person initially or the ones that bounce off as well?  Damage can differ so much depending on how many of the bounces you count.. Especially when you start counting 2nd and 3rd bounces. The damage can become over 200..
Shadowrun,3d01m1,JoxFox,3,Sun Jul 12 16:07:42 2015 UTC,"As written you count the bounces to. Though only straight lines. So, no bounces off of walls to the sides. But if you're standing between two walls, and a grenade explodes at your feet, you'll get the initial damage, than the damage reflecting of both walls adjusted for range, if there's still enough damage left when they hit the wall again and come back, you'll take that damage again, and so on, and so forth, until the grenades damage has been reduced to 0 by travel. This is what's called chunky salsa, because you only get one roll do resist, and the damage can reach a very high number."

Under a Criminal SIN I'd say it's pretty damn impossible to ever get a legal weapons license, private investigators license, bodyguard license, whatever.   Driver's license is probably ok, even a Hunting License would be very very unlikely.  Right now it's around $50-$100/month RL to rent a storage unit, most GMs should be fine with something like that.   Just stop off there on the way to/from the run to get the gear.   A lot of those places should take cash/cert sticks without requiring a SIN (for sure DON'T give 'em your criminal sin).

Now if you pay to have the Criminal SIN erased, you could theoretically get a real SIN (most GMs won't give you the karma points for it though, and it IS a big disadvantage), and then somehow qualify for real licenses, but man what a risk.  The most likely way is to have a really good fake SIN, NEVER do anything criminal under it, have a separate home, car, etc.  It still won't hold up to sufficiently detailed investigation though, because without a TON of work you won't actually have a legit job to justify your income, legit friends, history, etc.    You'd have to really be under the microscope to have somebody investigate that thoroughly, but if they do you're in trouble.

Shadowrun,3cy72w,BitRunr,3,Thu Jul 16 23:52:07 2015 UTC,"The problem with having a legit SIN in general, is that it's really your information on record.  When you see movies where the spy opens a briefcase and pulls out a handful of passports and ID cards with different names on them, those are fake SINs. So today you can be Seymour Buttes, and tomorrow you can be Tex Alkindes. And if anybody figures out that Tex swiped his ID card at the front door, and then robbed the place a few minutes later... you just throw away the Tex IDs and use another next time.  But when you have a legit SIN in the system, and you leave a fingerprint, a hair follicle, a drop of blood at a crime scene... they can trace it back to you. They will have your real name, your real parents, your real high school yearbook photo to plaster on ARO Wanted posters. And especially with your back story, pretending to be dead... the first time the local authorities call up Ares and say ""So we could evidence that ComradeUncleJoe was at this location..."" then Ares is going to come looking for you. Now you're a liability to the team, to your friends and acquaintances, to anybody that gets in Ares' way.  In addition, most Runners end up being eco-terrorist mercenaries, working to fight ""The Man"". And if you have a Corp SIN, it shows that at one point you were ""The Man."" And as a Firewatch member, you probably traded shots with some Runners in the past. So there's a chance that some Runner you shot at may come along one day looking to settle a grudge.  Another thing to note... there are 2 kinds of Corp SINs. Either you were some random Joe who got hired by the Corp, so they converted your National SIN into a Corp one. Or you were born to Corp parents, and you had a Corp SIN from the start. If you had one from the start, then it means your records are sealed within the Corp databanks. For some GMs, this means if someone tries to do a background check on you they don't get anything (rather suspicious). Or for others, if they do a search they get blocked by a message that says ""These records are for Ares Personnel only"" or something (definitely a tip off). Generally, Runners will treat you badly with either one, although if they find out you were Corp born (""with a silver spoon in your mouth"" and all that) they may treat you worse. Or they may call up Ares to see if there's a reward for your return.  All the rest of it sounds fine. Give your guy decent weapon skills, and pick up a copy of Run & Gun so you can specialize in Firefight, the martial art taught to Firewatch members. But you're not going to be able to play a veteran Spec Ops guy who retired, not with the limited skills you get at CharGen. More likely, you're a fresh recruit who washed out of the program. Or take Bad Rep and say that it was your first mission and you're the reason why the team got killed. Gives you more back story, if Ares wants to know what really happened."
Shadowrun,3cy72w,marcus_gideon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:31:07 2015 UTC,"Right BUT the way I understand the fluff/lore is that only the corporation who has the samples can actually do a full match, any other corp, government or organization they're very unlikely to cooperate with without some hugely good reason (""civic duty"" isn't on that list).   They can verify a SIN by submitting some combination of biometric measurements plus the SIN number and get back a ""valid/invalid"" response from the SIN issuer, but they are not (as a rule) allowed to submit biometric measurements and get back a list of matching SINs.   And the only way for it to make sense, is that the biometric quantities associated with a SIN aren't enough to identify a person 100%, they're a numerical index of a quality.   Like say height, it's hard to get an exact height so say it's divided into half inch ""buckets"", with the most likely values being between 5' and 6.5' (yeah yeah dwarves giants work with me here it only changes the numbers not the concept) - that's 36 buckets, so just in Seattle (say 3 million SIN, 3 million non) that's hundreds of thousands of ""hits"" if they only have a height.   It will be similar for fingerprint or retina print or DNA, it's too expensive to try to do exact match, they'll take 5 or 10 points to compare or something, say that divides it into 10,000 or even 100,000 ""buckets"".  If they try to do it TOO fine, then the verification equipment gets very expensive. Now with 10000 buckets granularity there's still 300 SIN/300 nonSIN ""matches"" just in Seattle.  A cheap biometric scanner won't even be able to do that well, it might only have 1/10th the resolution.  This is still pretty good for SIN verification because it's  the combination of metrics that make it really unique, and even if the combination only narrows it down to 1/10,000 persons that still ties it to a person pretty well, it accomplishes one main goal of making it hard to steal a SIN and use it.  One reason Corporate SINner quality gets so much karma, though, is that that corporate issuer CAN look up blood samples/fingerprints, and might even do so for outside entities if the crime is sufficiently notorious OR the outside entity cares enough about it to pay sufficient compensation to breach the privacy.   IF the outside organization knows which corp to submit the query to, it gets expensive bribing every possible corp to submit fingerprints.  EDIT: and even for the issuing corp, they still have to start out their internal query using the ""bucket"" method, and only then look through each of those matches looking for an exact match.  So for petty crimes that's gonna be too much effort, but with enough cause it CAN be done.  And in any case, layer on cost-cutting, workers not giving a shit, equipment errors, anarchist hackers trying to fuck it all up by corrupting the records and programs, etc.  A lot of that isn't explicitly in the lore, but it's the only way I can make it make sense, otherwise it's TOO easy to ID people, and yet fake SINS and shadowrunners exist...."
Shadowrun,3cy72w,gimlettio,2,Sat Jul 11 22:46:35 2015 UTC,"Fake SINs exist, b/c most Runners are born SINless. So they can submit DNA samples and all that to a hacker, who breaks into the databases and creates false entries. If you leave evidence at a crime scene, they pull up the records for John Doe and try to knock on the door for the address on record, which is a Pizza Hut.  But your real SIN will be for the real you, with a real photo, real parents' address, all that stuff. So they will either track down your real loved ones, or they will reveal that the real you didn't die all those years ago when you left your old life behind.  The samples are going to point at your SIN regardless. But when the booking Sergeant at the precinct runs your prints, it's either going to say ""No Records Found"" (if your GM rules that Corp sealed records are invisible) or it will say ""For Ares Personnel Only"", and then they place a call to Ares, send over the samples, and now Ares knows you're still alive."

The only way I could think of to have it work is that the samples they inserted for the Rating 6 are a close enough match for the biometric measurement they use, the fingerprints are close but not exact matches, etc.   And it works because queries are not ""is this a molecule to molecule exact match"" but more of a ""does this match 99.99%"".  Because even just that is enough wiggle room - that means 1/10,000 so again just in seattle there's 300 SIN + 300 non-SIN who would satisfy that match of that one biometric measurement.   (Even this is too good though, because the combination of multiple 99.99% biometrics really does  uniquely identify a specific person, or very very VERY tiny subset, like 2 or 3 in the world max - for that I have to wave hands and mumble about ""data rot"", anarchist hackers, corporate inefficiency, etc. because that's ""too good"")"

Shadowrun,3cy72w,Hobbes2073,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"Just a disclaimer in that I'm not the biggest lore buff around.  So, this can get as involved and technical as you like.  Something to keep in mind about Firewatch when you're making a character based on one is that they're the elite of the elite of the elite.  They rank at or above the likes of DEVGRU (whom they actually have contracts with to provide training for), the Sioux Wildcats, the Tir Ghosts, so on and so forth.  They're the premier black ops unit for the biggest war-specialized company on Earth, and they have a reputation for good reason.  I like to ask questions about ex-corporate characters in general when I'm looking to make one.  The biggest of which is, ""Why did he leave?""  Why was he unsatisfied with what Ares provided?  Why wouldn't he go back into their open arms?  Perhaps the massacre was his responsibility, or perhaps he was simply disillusioned with some things he had to do - the latter of which is unlikely, considering all of the implants and psychological sculpting that Firewatch members would have gone through.  I don't know how other people play it, but at my table the SIN quality is used for a currently active, in-use profile.  For your use, ""Files On Record: Ares"" may work better, as they have his biometric information and complete background, but he would be trying to distance himself from his previous life with Ares.  It's also likely that his SIN would be archived or otherwise made inactive on his death in order to prevent such a privileged SIN from being rerouted and copied as a fake, which is always possible despite Zurich Orbital's crazy security measures.  If you decide to go that route, really play up on paranoia.  Have him be absolutely obsessed with leaving no trace of his presence at target sites - no blood, no body fluids, nothing.  If Ares has a reason to suspect they have a rogue agent on their hands, then you might begin reenacting a much more brutal version of The Bourne Identity.  As far as stuff to start with goes?  1.) Augmentations galore.  Alpha grade, if possible, as that's what his body is adjusted to.  It may very well be that he took out Beta or even Delta grade hardware specifically to avoid it being tracked by Ares, then replaced it with as good a quality as he could find.  He might not have all of his toys, but at least he'd have something that won't be tracked.  2.) High skills.  High skills.  We're playing on experience over all here.  Don't be afraid to nab the quality that raises the cap of one of your skills by one, as Firewatch normally has all of their relevant skills in the 6 to 10 range, and usually on the higher side of that.  I'd honestly say skills and attributes as high as you can get them.  3.) Lowish lifestyle, or Bolt Hole.  Play up on that he really doesn't want to be found or identified.  4.) He might not have a lot of good equipment at the beginning.  You'd think he might start with an Ares Alpha, but once you realize that Ares would've been the owner - not him - it becomes hilariously easy to track.  He would've had to literally start with a blank slate.  How would other runners feel?  Probably uncomfortable.  Firewatch, and other tier 1 groups, have a reputation to be tenacious as hell.  Any runners who have ever faced off or lost someone to such forces might have an immediate distrust if not hatred.  Maybe pick up a quality like Bad Rep that makes people who know of your past treat you with disdain.  Beyond that, if you're actively being hunted by Ares and your team figures that out, they might not want anything to do with you.  On the other hand, they might require your assistance based on how good you are at fighting."

Shadowrun,3cy72w,Malkleth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:49:51 2015 UTC,"I think of the SINner qualities a bit differently, it's not that difficult to burn your old SIN, it kind of is, but it just costs a lot of karma to do so. It shows you invested time and resources into having your old SIN scrubbed from the data bases when you buy off the quality.  I look at being a SINner that you want your SIN. Because that's your ticket out of leaving the Shadows and entering back to your normal life in the corporation. But for some reason you were cast out, like internal politics, you were a scapegoat, etc. So you had to leave the safety of your corporate enclave and enter the shadows to avoid losing your SIN for good, or be fired, or be killed, or whatever. But the important thing is you still want back in.  Hanging out with the filthy SINless is quite the heavy burden to bare, but you'll do it just for the chance to get back into your happy enclave with the slightly drugged water, and 24/7 corporate ads telling you of the newest hot product released by your parent corp. Because that is safety, that is happiness, that is love. Not like living with the rats in your current barren hideaway hole in the wall with random gang violence happening just outside of your front door. I mean, how can these uneducated brutes know of anything of what it's like to be a real person working an honest 16 hour work day.  So anyway, I'd just be SINless. It's just easier to work with most concepts. You can totally leave your background the same, just that he was smart enough to burn his old SIN before leaving Ares.  Also, Chicago was almost 20 years ago (2058, current year is 2076). Obviously there are still lots of bugs out there, but if you wanted to take apart in the events of Bug City, you'll need to be in your 40's. Just something to keep in mind. If you want to be younger, that's also not a problem, because it's not like the bugs are all gone or anything. They're just a lot more subtle about it now."
Shadowrun,3cy72w,dethstrobe,2,Sat Jul 11 21:40:21 2015 UTC,"The problem with burning a legit SIN, is managing to find someone who can get into all those databases and erase every trace you existed.  Otherwise, the first bit of evidence you leave behind is going to bring up your real records. And suddenly you aren't dead anymore, and the Corp wants to know why."

Last I heard, pockets of stealth tags doesn't work in the way people want it to, and only requires a handful of wall-mounted radio signal scanners in a facility to point out exactly how the silent icons are strangely congregated in one moving spot.

Shadowrun,3cy72w,BitRunr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:42:23 2015 UTC,"That can be hand waved at chargen. Most characters should have some kind of fixer, or organized crime contact that could handle the erasing of an SIN.  That's why I recommend that if you pick up a SINner quality, you actually want that SIN, unless its criminal, then you're just stuck with that one. Its too easy for players to pick up the SIN quality and think they can avoid paying the ""tax"" because they wouldn't want to pay the corporation anyway. Players pay the tax, to make their legit SIN look clean, while they run around in the Shadows making dirty money."

Shadowrun,3cy72w,marcus_gideon,2,Sat Jul 11 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"Right, at chargen it's no problem, you've somehow in the past had it done, or faked your death, or Crash, or they screwed up, or whatever.  ""no SIN"" is the default, even if you should have had one because of your backstory, that's just fluff not a mechanical advantage so you shouldn't have to pay to change it.  If you do take SINner quality at chargen and want to get rid of it later, the rule is to pay 2x the karma you received for it, that's a realistic measurement of the difficulty to find someone who could do that and doing enough favors for them to pay them - paying 50 karma to buy off Corporate SINner is a pretty substantial commitment..."

Shadowrun,3cy72w,Malkleth,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:40:25 2015 UTC,"So, ok, assuming this character has a corporate born sin, his backstory is gonna be: his parents were ares. His grantparents were probably ares. He went to an Ares school, where he got fed Ares-brand lunches and learned corporate-approved materials. Then he tests really high in whatever they are looking for, and joins the corporate military at a highly trusted grade.  Then, he quits not only Firewatch (in fairness, their burnout rate is probably pretty high) but the company to enter the shadows. To do this he basically would have to burn every bridge, leave all his family, friends from childhood, etc etc, behind, plus go against every lesson inoculated into him in school (Ares isn't a corporation, ares is a family!). Something has gone seriously awry - he didn't even join another megacorp! He went from corporate nobility to scum. It would almost be like if one of the Walton or the Romney kids ran away from home to become a bank robber after a dozen years in the family business, instead of following the golden future laid out for them.  As for the Shadows, most people become shadowrunners because they are poor and desperate. They start out as gangmembers, mafia wannabes, and the like. They would have killed, literally, to go to school and eat real food every day. When they find out someone is a Walton or a Romney they tend to react.. badly."
Shadowrun,3cy72w,ChromeEagle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:00:56 2015 UTC,"First of all: This character can be made and it can make sense. Despite the stats of grunts or primer runners in any publicatioon, there can absolutely be an exception that allows a lesser individual to get to a high place in the world. Even with the normal character creation rules you can make your character a special case who was allowed entry to the team even if he didn't meet their usual standards.  Perhaps you were a rising star, someone many people had their eye on and that gave you entry into Firewatch. Or you perhaps got there by doing a favor for someone at Ares.  You can give him anything you would normally be able to get under character creation rules but your GM might be willing to increase the Availability maximum from 12 to 16 or 20 for you. As for 'bad vibes' that is totally up to you. It sounds like he might not have any since he genuinely likes Ares."

Still, does he absolutely HAVE to be from Firewatch itself?  I mean even Ares alone has all kinds of special ops and HTR teams.  Can't he have been ""training for Firewatch"" or ""moving up and being eyed for Firewatch"" or something that wouldn't QUITE have the burden of expectations that a multi-year Firewatch veteran would have?  I mean I know everybody wants to be top elite, but it's still pretty impressive to be ""ex state-senator"" you don't have to be ""former President of the USA""...."

Shadowrun,3cy72w,Wakshaani,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"Firewatch ain't what it used to be.  .  When it started, teh Firewatch teams were the best of the best of teh best, three squads of hyper-elite sorts who put Shadowrunners to shame. They were ""Top Men"", the in-house guys that always get teh job done. They're the ones who went in when the High-Threat Teams weren't enough.  .  Essentially, they were Pararescue.  .  As the Bug problem got worse, standards slipped as the need for the teams got larger. They're no better than any type of elite ""Red Samurai"" unit now and, in all honesty, are likely even worse, now watered-down to little more than a standard high threat team. The luster's gone and the Ares infighting (and bugs in the machine) have just chewed them up.   .  At this point, a starting Shadowrunner could easily have been a member of Firewatch, and probably is a bit sad that they'd heard all these stories about how AMAZING they were, then managed to get in and found out that, nope, they're not All That. Oh, they're good, but they aren't what they were.   .  In effect, they went from Pararescue to Seals to plain ol' Marines... better than the regular Army, but there's just too many of them to really hold that ""Most elite of the elite"" rating any more.  Remember, there are forces at work inside Ares that either want Knight to look bad, want to kill off his 'babies', or want anything that could slow Insect Spirits down ruined. Sandbagging the Firewatch Teams is something that all of those forces are interested in seeing happen."
Shadowrun,3cy72w,Wakshaani,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:02:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, and while I'm here, a lot of how you'd assemble them is how you imagine interacting with the rest of the team. Do you need to be the high-Agility, multi-action killbot for teh team? Are yuou, instead, the badass brawler who was known for ripping a Fire Ant spirit in half with her bare hands? Maybe you're the seasoned vet/""Sarge"", the level-headed one who won't lose their snot when things go down. Or, heck, you could be the tech nerd for a team, the one who keeps everyone else's Smartlinks running and commlinks unjammed when in hostile territory and, otherwise, is sort of the wimpy team 'mascot'.   .  Lots of ways to go.  .  For a generic build, I'd suggest SKills A, Stats B, Money C, and Race D. A basic 4 in the physicals, 3 in the mentals works, or you can transfer a point from Charisma to Agility for more combat, less leadership.   .  For skills, Automatics 6 (Assault RIfles +2), Etiquette 2 (Military +2) (( Or Corporate )), CLose Combat Group 4, Throwing 2 (Grenades +2), and Pilot Ground Vehicle 2 (Cars +2) will get you through a bunch of it. Toss in some athletic skills (Especially climbing), Leadership 2-ish, Perception 4, Armorer/Computer/Hardware/First Aid at 1 each, and you're mostly home. Pistols 4 for a back-up weapon, then season to taste.   .  Taa daa, Firewatch guy.  .  For cyber, Alpha Wired 1 is plenty, add in some muscle toner/augmentation, and maybe steel bones, call it a day. Most of your sensory gear will be in your helmet after all, get some good armor, some grenades, and a nice selection of ammo. If you have extensive bug experience, some points in the Ares SuperSquirt will let you take some insecticide options, or you can just use grenades. Either way, take ""Insect Spirits 4"" as a knowledge skill."

When needed, the GM could ""jump"" into an NPC and control their talk and actions, so they'd control the Johnson, key NPCs met along the run, and the Big Bad(s) at the end.   Enemy mooks could just fight on their own.

Shadowrun,3cubu2,ChromeEagle,2,Fri Jul 10 21:19:14 2015 UTC,The Seattle 2072 sourcebook is exactly what I came here to say. It's a book with multiple adventure hooks and NPC sketches on every page. All of the setting books do this to one extent or another.

That is, Fashion, Sports, Music, Drugs...basically all the background dressing. If you have extra cash pick it up, however you can probably do without if you really need to. That said I just really enjoy that book.  There are a couple others you might find useful. Corporate Guide is again set in 4E but its useful to have a look at the Corporations and there's a fair bit of information of again background information. Corporate Enclaves gives you a overview of Hong Kong, Tokyo and LA(i think on that last one) which can be useful."

Have them find the mangled remains of a team that stumbled across it, mention the titanium bone lacing now charred and visible on the dead streetsam is both bent and partially melted. Fleeing packs of ghouls as both an encounter and a message that this thing freaks everything out. A completely abandoned squat, except all the bedding and personal possessions are still there, and the charred walls have shadowed shapes on them. . .

Shadowrun,3cuioq,felicidefangfan,2,Fri Jul 10 23:08:52 2015 UTC,"Remember, horror comes from the unexpected - especially the unexpected that you thought you could expect.  Is there any way the hellhound can mask its astral signature? Hide its PAN on the grid? I don't have the game knowledge to answer these questions, but if the hellhound can do these things it's a great element to the story. Imagine runners tracking a signal that they think is the dog while it pads up behind them...  An obvious caveat to a horror-themed run is that a lot of people die in horror movies. So your players might want to know the odds going in, and maybe not run with Johnny Sparkle the twice-initiated  prime runner they love. Or anyone they want to keep. Because they're going to do more than one surprise combat with a high-level combat creature."

Trouble is, it's on the 43rd floor of their skyscraper and warded to all hell. You'll need a mage to help bust through all the magical defenses.  The team has to figure a way in and get to the actual vault, which is protected by Wards out the ass. I'm talking like 20 of the fuckers, all in between you and your target. And to make matters worse, your mage aint running at full steam because the Feng-shui of the room is giving her a background count.  No matter, the meat team are goinna be busy wiith all the spirits being sent their way. I'm talking like dozens of the bastards, all lower forces (Around 3-4), attacking in waves and trying to soften em up for the actual HTR division.   Speaking of which, here they come now, all with glowing Qi Foci and Kung-Fu skills, rushing towards the team to disarm and incapacitate with fists of fury and martial arts.   While everyone was Kungfu fighting perhaps your mage has figured out that by messing with the furniture her job gets easier? (Priobably because the decker was thrown into a pot plant and broke the damn thin). You can up the intensity of magical traps now, especially alchemy. You touch the lock to the vault and get hit with a force 5 fireball.   THey're into the vault, but it's throbbing with so much Background count your mage is basically mundane at the moment. They grab the jade statue they came for and fight their way through even more ghostly mooks.  The smoke clears and then you are met with a lone warrior, like the adepts befiore him, but this time he's tough. He's a mystic adept. And he's a dodge monkey. The guy has like 28 dice to dodge (Combat sense and Agile defender) and will fling Manaballs to hit the runners but not hurt the turf. He's the guy you wanna run away from.  Team gets out of the building the fast way, hopefully attaching some way of getting to ground level or shooting off into the next building via grappling hook. Perhaps an aerial escape in a Wasp to out in Pullyalup or Redmond where you can split up and get this puppy into a nice shitty polluted area to hide it's magical aura."

The KE patrols will be the first responders, allowed to help out Aztechnology under a trade agreement- business as usual.  The Vault requires a powerful drill to get through, but you brought that along with you, right? Once past the door, which will take 5 minutes (Fun gameplay idea, you need the wireless on for the Drill to auto heal any jams, but that allows deckers to hit it), you're gonna have to get through a locked gate.   BUUUT, Azzies being the bastards they are have anti sawing traps in place, and will vent the room full of neurostun to combat this. If the runners did their homework, they brought some Hazmat suits to slip into while they saw.  Meanwhile, outside the Azzies have started knocking. Instead of a swat team, it's 6-7 ork cartel bruisers, all high on kamikaze with BIIIIG fragging Combat axes that rush at the team with no regard for their own safety. For added kicks, have them enable a pain editor so they don't go down until they're dead.  When the runners get in the vault and start sawing open some Lock boxes, They meet a very angry Earth Spirit, who bursts through the ground and tries to grab a runner and quicksand him under ground. Meanwhile outside, a spirit of air is quickly firing off bolts of lightning at the runners and attempting to strangulate em.  Then comes the scary ninja adepts. Only three of them, but they have Invisibility cast on them, Traceless walk, High sneaking dice and all sorts of other B&E stuff. Their mission is simple, Don't kill the runners but take a sample of their blood for tracking purposes later. If one of them succeeds, the team will have to get the bastard before he gets to safety, or baaad stuff will follow them to the safehouse.  They got the loot and credsticks from the safety deposit boxes (And remembered to scan for tags?) Good. Now they have to get out, which is easier said than done, because The Azzies have stopped playing around. When they exit the vault, they are greeted by a 10 foot tall troll with a vindicator starting to spin up. He's very happy to see them, and will shoot nice hot loads of supressing fire at them to keep em pinned down for the other baddies to reposition into a killing filed.  They get away from the pondering giant? Good, but they're not out of the woods yet. The Cops have made a Shock Shield Wall at the exit and are trying to corner you. Perfect time to use a grenade and leg it.  You're outside. Your van was parked a couple of blocks away so it wouldn't get the tires popped by the cops. You're not getting away that easy, as the Azzies have a few tricks up their sleeves. Barghests are released and give chase, howling to freeze the Runners in their place. Hope you invested in some cyberears to turn off your auditory sensors.  Yoiu beat back the doggies, and are at the van. So close to home now. The wheelman starts to drive, when the motorcycle cops give chase. Guys with SMGs in one hand and A Suzuki Mirage underfoot not letting up. The team somehow breaks away or kills them all? Their final challenge is a helicopter with a swat sniper, aiming for the driver, or at least a tire. You'll need to take him out before you can ditch the car, your clothes and find a place to blend into.  Remember that dye packs, tracking devices and fake credsticks that are actually frag grenades that go off when you slot em should be in the dozens and a constant threat. Give em a year off to enjoy the spoils, or prison and then get your next heist going."
Shadowrun,3cs6b3,NotB0b,9,Fri Jul 10 11:57:12 2015 UTC,"It's easy to do if you want to run a magical bankrobbing campaiign. Just be aware that your players will go down hard as frag when the hammer drops if they're not smart.  How I would do a heist campaign is rags to riches. Start them out robbing the stuffer shack in Foodfight, move em up to small time jewellery stores then banks. Then the good shit like mystical magic diamonds in a penthouse vault or a Tonne of pure Aztlan Novacoke.  You might even want to have a session devoted to planning the run. Provide blue prints (Maybe the runners need to steal em or bribe for em), access points, security camera locations, employee databases, Suitable buyers, police response times, all that shit. If they don't research, they're not gonna come close to pulling this off.  Try to make sure most of the ruins can be stealthed if done perfectly (However a few big loud and proud ones are fine)  You want to follow the same sort of deal as the payday enemies do, with about 10-20 blues rocking up asap, trying to negotiate with the runners and just slow them down (Cut power, Cordon off the roads, lay down tire spikes, throw gas grenades through the windows, that stuff.)  Inside the heist areas, you'll need a slow moving objective. Best way to do this is a drill that tales a while to get through, or have the decker need to jack through a bunch of locks. Or both.  When they are being busy, have hostage rescue teams start sneaking away all their bargaining chips. Force them to keep mobile by hitting multiple areas at once.  When you feel it is thematically appropriiate, send in a swat team of about 5-8 soldiers, 1 adept and a decker. The enemy decker will actively try to slow the team down by re-locking locks and turning the environment hostiile.   When the swat team is dealt with, and again it is thematically appropriate, perhaps have em hit by a tougher swat team, with Riotshields, Gas grenades (Neuro-Stun is such fun), Chameleon Cloaked ninjas, spirits, all that funky stuff.  Then, if they have their objective or have dawdled too long, you drop the big guns, HTR teams. 2 Mages, A big Troll with a minigun and 40 soak dice, Street sams wired to the gills and other scary drek- This is stuff they are meant to run away from, not engage.  When they get to the Van (Which will need to be hidden from sight), the battle becomes a moving one. The wheelman has to escape choppers, Snipers, Ninjas on motorcycles, that kind of drek. They need to break away, blend in then split up and meet at the safehouse later.   Having a Fixer who gets them jobs and acts like a Bain is a good idea, he feeds them info and all that stuff and launders the money. Have a few sessions of them enjoying their loot or just some safehouse banter.  If one of them gets arrested, have the runners do a prisoin breakout (Like Hox).  You effectively have to take all the video game elements out, but keep the tactics and theme in.  I'll write up a few example banks in a second."
Shadowrun,3cs6b3,NotB0b,5,Fri Jul 10 11:29:49 2015 UTC,"Okay. I have some of my notes here:  Example Heists:   Jewellery store. - Level: Radiant (From Training Level to Draconic) - Location: Radiant (Depends on level) - Guards: 2-4, depending on neighbourhood. - Security Level: Cheap. They're not a very big branch.  - Knight Errant Reaction Time: 2 Minutes. - Additional Features: None.  - Cut: 5k + 5k per bag of jewels. (Between 4-12 bags)  Bank Heist  - Level: Radiant (From Training Level to Draconic) - Location: Radiant (Depends on level) - Guards: 3-5, depending on neighbourhood. - Security Level: Decent. It's a bank.  - Knight Errant Reaction Time: 1 Minute. - Additional Features: 2nd Vault Door, main vault door can be hacked open, but is in a local system (Must have a decker/hacker/technomancer on-site to operate), possibility of a magical ward to hold the second vault door in place, JUST IN CASE. - Cut: 20k + x (depending on what they had found in the vault [i.e. gold, information, artifacts, cash stored in the vault system itself])   Example contacts:  ""Kalash"" [2 Connection, 3 Loyalty] - Local Black Market weapons contact. - Loyal to D3M0N (SR version of Bain) more than anyone else. - Runs a gun-running ring within the local Seattle and Salish-Shide areas.   - Dependable, but ""high markup"" for guns and modifications (paying for licensing as well)  ""Dan de Leon"" [2 Connection, 2 Loyalty] - Drug-runner from the Aztlan  - Needs the runners to flip around with local novacoke and cram shipments in and around the city, between supplier and dealer (Essentially needs drug middlemen).  - Is also in a gang war against local gangs, and Ghost Cartels.  - Will provide weapons to combat against specific things, if they can't do so, but with a price, of course.    If one of them gets arrested, have the runners do a prison breakout (Like Hox).   I'd rather they break an NPC out, who'll be able to add extra features once a few quests are done to help him set up, rather than getting a character out themselves.   I also don't expect for my players to do ALL the dirty work, such as hide evidence. I'd rather they meet up with people who can do a better job at such a thing, rather than having them learn more skills."

Definitely a giood idea for some downtime sessions, perhaps doing some regular shadowrunner stuff for these contacts to get on their good side and then make the team.

Shadowrun,3cs6b3,Elaphoil,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:37:24 2015 UTC,"Well, most of D3M0N's heists are for either contacts that are rather hush-hush on who they are, or are small-name syndicates trying their toes in the big pond of international smuggling/laundering.  Those who want to bring their names out, such as ""Dan de Leon"", or ""Dragan"" have their own errands need taken care of, which are semi-independent of D3M0N's actions due to their own network of contacts and the types of skills they can bring to the table.    have a heist to get the attention of some of these people so they offer to join the team   That's how it all starts, really. A bank heist here, a smuggling operation there. At some point, I'll get them to meet a proper Mr. Johnson, such as the mysterious ""Mr. Ocean"", who will prep them up with ""Legacy Heists"" (Heists designed to get them more prestige, to get their brand name out there).

Shadowrun,3cs6b3,Firebat4321,2,Fri Jul 10 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"Like I mentioned below, physical cash is a rarity these days. There's more corp scrip than nuyen bills by far, and both of those dwarf the amount of UCASh you can find. The most of any of that you would find would be in a bank, to be sure, but we're talking a briefcase amount, not a duffel bag. The kinds of things a thief of the classical kind would steal in the Sixth World have changed. Cash has been replaced with credsticks, gold with orichalcum, art with artifacts. And the necessary skills have shifted around, too. You need a mage to find magical artifacts  and verify their value, you need a decker to crack open credsticks, or simply pull cash out of the matrix. You need a smuggler to move almost anything really worthy, especially orichalcum with certain orgs keeping track of every ounce. The real challenge in doing heists is finding a target. Most Shadowrunners get their targets via Johnsons and they're not making the grab for themselves. Most valuable stuff isn't the kind of thing you couldlook at and know it's valuable, scoop it up, and get nuyen for it on the street. Anything you could is rare, and whom has it knows it, and they don't try do advertise. So research is important. Plus, with targets so rare, it's a fair bet any score is going to involve competition. When you go independant, the system that keeps work nice and orderly goes away, and things get pretty cutthroat. You've got a crosshair on you from the minute you start working the job, until the goods are gone and the money is safely in the bank. So, all in all, pretty much exactly like Shadowrunning, which makes sense considering Shadowrunners are pretty much bank robbers with rich clientele."

I was able to run Four Stores before the team fell apart. It was a simple job for the Mafia: go to four shops in the downtown area and rough up the shop owners to get them back on Mafia's payroll.  Of course, each shop had a reason to bailing out on the Mafia, like the dive bar that had drunken Lone Star cops driving away customers, or the Chinese laundromat that had their hidden backroom turned into a Triad gambling den.  My advice: each job, try to find a nice twist that can surprise the crew. I find Payday most fun when flying by the seat of my pants, so unexpected developments makes the crew have to think quick and smart to keep the job under control.  TL;DR: Try to give each job a twist for the crew; it'll make it more fun."

Once that was arranged we had to drop the goods off on the yaks' boat and cover it from the second hit squad and then escape again as Lone Star tried to crash the party.

If you don't want Wolverine claws, you could also do what other's suggested and pick up Bone Lacing or Bone Density treatments, they won't give you any AP, but they will up your damage and cause physical rather than stun damage."

Well these two J's are straight outta china and are a tighter team than any runner could be. They finish each other's sentences and know everything about one another- which is not cute or lovey dovey when they are discussing how you need to kidnap a scientist.  Mr Johnson, Cheng Tao is a mundane Johnsons who has been with Wuxing for his entire life, growing up in (CAMPAIGN COUNTRY HERE) in a Wuxing Enclave. He has a Data Jack, Tailored Pheromones, Olfactory Booster (So he can turn off the ability to smell if he detects the face's pheromones) and cyber eyes to record the runner's faces. He's a professional to the core, calm, cool and collected and always on business.  Mrs Johnson, Ming Wei Tao is a magician focusing on social intrigue and mind magic. She takes delight in abusing the power she has in the meet and showing off,. Her three main spells are Analyse Truth, Influence, mindlink (Extended) and Mind Probe (Low Force). When the enemy face makes a counter offer, she will influence him prior into thinking that ""the payment being offered is fair, and if s/he asks for too much then he risks pissing off the Johnsons"". She is the Ying to Cheng's Yang, always moving about, laughing and flirting with the runners to put them off guard.  She will assist Mr. Johnson's dicepool with her own (They each have 14 dice), to buff them up higher.   These guys are pros and are known to the shadow community as realiable but scary. There are rumors that teams who fail them are never seen again, after a visit from a very very angry fire spirit. They are bilingual in Cantonese and (CAMPAIGN LANGUAGE).

If I was a player in that group, someone would be astral perceiving and Mrs Johnson would probably leave the meet horizontally.

Astrally percieving at the meet is a Faux Pas in some circles, especially because Mrs. J would catch you then make fun of you for not trusting her enough. Mr. Johnson would then chime in about how this business is built upon a modicum of trust, it would be best to show some- for without it then he cannot hire you  Oh and this sort of behaviour is expected from Wuxing J's:  Run faster, Page 206   I’ve made a point of telling you never to use magic in a meet, and especially not manipulation spells—well, Wuxing Johnsons break that rule. They will use magic on you. They typically limit the intrusion to Analyze Truth, but still, be aware this is going to happen and stay frosty."
Shadowrun,3csfcl,LemurianLemurLad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:11:22 2015 UTC,"I don't see a problem with both parties using perception for the entire meet. It's a basic precaution against eavesdropping, magical assault and overt deception. Even Analyze Truth is probably fine as long as people know it's being cast.  But Mind Probe and Influence are direct magical assaults on the target. The Johnson could be doing almost anything with those spells.  Also, there's a bit of a conundrum with Mrs J complaining about using perception: she's using it as well if she's catching our team.  At the very least, I'd have my team threaten to walk if the J got pissy about using perception.  If a J cast Analyze Truth without mentioning it, I'd definitely walk if I weren't allowed quid quo pro.  Mind Probe and Influence probably end the meet with guns drawn and lead potentially flying.  Frankly, I'd be worried for any team that lets their Johnsons get away with that kind of crap."

Are you going to strip search your Johnson? No? Then you don't assense him.  Or at least don't get caught.   It is personally intrusive, violates pretty much all social norms. For most people, there isn't a whole lot of difference in how uncomfortable they are with you analyzing their soul, vs groping their junk to make sure they don't have a streetline special fanny packed.

Shadowrun,3csfcl,LemurianLemurLad,3,Fri Jul 10 14:45:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm all about meeting in a nice neutral night club.  I know they don't have guns, they know I don't have guns.  We both politely pretend we don't have backup right outside the room. Nobody acknowledges that both sides have enhanced pheromones, hidden recording devices, matrix support, maybe a couple of drones nearby, or a troll with enough strength to turn the other parties heads into brain-flavored jelly.  And certainly nobody uses hostile mind magic.  Meeting with the Johnson is about both sides covering their...  Assets.  If the Johnson only hires teams that won't act to protect themselves from basic stuff, they're not going to have many teams to pick from in the future.  Sure, they can tell people that the team is full of flakes, but just like Mr J, the team should be (subtly) recording things as well.  If the rumors start to fly, the runners can let it be known that the Mr and Mrs Johnson have absurd expectations for their teams, use mind-manipulation spells, and don't allow runners to take basic precautions to defend themselves.  Wuxing isn't the only company hiring.  If the team is worth half a damn, they can find work somewhere else.  Turning down a job because of the absurd demands of the Johnson isn't going to ruin anyone's rep.  That's the whole point of the meet: the Johnson is exchanging payment for services the runner is willing to provide.  If the terms either party sets aren't acceptable, they can both walk away.  Forcing the other side to agree with you is a fantastic way to end up falling down an elevator shaft onto some bullets next Tuesday.  Honestly, if your interpretation of the game is ""players will do what I want or I will make them suffer,"" I'm glad that I'm not in your group.  It sounds like you've got a very nice railroad laid out for them.  Getting bent over a barrel and forced to agree to asinine terms isn't fun for anyone.  Edit to add: you're missing another angle to Shadowrun entirely with your threats. Just because nobody's hiring doesn't mean the characters are going to be broke.  If Wuxing ruins your reputation, fine. Move them to your ""companies we steal from just to kill time and improve our rep"" list.  Break into a Wuxing owned research lab, steal everything that looks interesting, sell at a fantastic discount to a trusted fixer.  Rinse and repeat.  Rep rebuilt as a team of people who are good at ""product acquisitions"" and ""hostile research techniques."" Wuxing might still hate you but you're probably impressing the heck out of someone else."
Shadowrun,3csfcl,NotB0b,3,Fri Jul 10 15:28:27 2015 UTC,"Alright chummer, you seem to be fixated on the fact that mind control would lead to instant termination of the job, this aint the case.  If your mage is paranoid enough to maintain astral perception, she's not gonna mess with your head as it'd be too obvious. The point of influence is that it is subtle, and can be done without much trace. Obviously being rude towards the Johnson will kake negotiations harder, (-2 social modifier), but no spells will be cast  Secondly, the thought she implants in the person's head isn't ""accept the run"", It's ""You are being paid enough, you shouldn't ask for more"". This can be easily countered by the rest of the team going, ""U WOT M8? Of course we want more!""  I recently ran these guys as Johnsons and the spell failed to take hold and one of the runners noticed it. He acted pretty professionally and was unphased by it all, getting straight down to business, actually throwing the Johnson's off kilter because that wasn't meant to happen (both J's lost a negotiation dice)"
Shadowrun,3csfcl,LemurianLemurLad,3,Fri Jul 10 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"It's clear that we've got very different interpretations of the social implications of casting hostile mind magic.  You consider it a minor inconvenience, I consider it to be almost  on par with rape or torture.  It's not something one uses against people and expect them to ever be remotely friendly again.  If the Johnson wouldn't wave a gun in the runner's face, they shouldn't use mind magic either.  Sure, you can strong arm people just fine that way, but it's not a good way to build a working relationship - it's profoundly disrespectful.  All this being said, I've absolutely used mind magic during a run on hostile forces, but usually its as a way to prevent a more violent approach to things.  Forcing a guard to go check on his car is way better than needing to kill him.  Mind probing a password from a target is probably a bit better than beating it out of them with a wrench.  Making a sniper throw his rifle into traffic is a nasty trick, but it's way the hell better than letting him shoot me.  That being said, if any of those folks realized what I was doing, I'd expect them to react with extreme anger or violence.  Its a calculated risk of use.  Lastly, I'm sure there's some perfectly valid uses of mind control as well.  I bet psych wards get all sorts of help from a calming spell, or a temporarily improved willpower score.  There's probably a booming business for voluntary ""don't do drugs"" compulsions in detox clinics.  But ""I'm going to dick around in your brain to save a few bucks on this mission?"" That's a good way to end up dead."

The first is simply to shrug it off and negotiate normally, either expecting this sort of thing from a Johnson, or simply being disgusted and using that in the negotiation. We'll call this the ""professional"" reaction.  Or, you can let the Johnson get what he wants: do his job cheaply. But you aren't going to be happy about it, and you're going to be pissed at him no matter what. Chances are your next job will revenge on the SOB. We'll call this the ""revenge"" reaction.  The third reaction is that your team geeks the guy at the first chance they get. Frag his job, and frag him. We'll call this the ""pissed off"" reaction.  Your Johnsons would only be able to get away with this behavior with astrally-inept teams (in which case they are hiring pretty cheap, crappy runner teams), or teams that are known to expect this sort of dirty dealing, probably coming fresh from experience with even nastier Johnsons. If the Johnsons haven't done their homework, they could very easily make some nasty enemies.  Simply using Analyze Truth, however, would be a minor slap on the wrist even if they got caught: because it's not inherently hostile.  Personally? I walk out, Johnson pair gets a nasty little blurb in whatever runner forum I'm frequenting."

Shadowrun,3csfcl,NotB0b,9,Fri Jul 10 23:03:52 2015 UTC,"Sergei Kirov, Cold Smile, Colder Heart  Sergei Kirov is the boss of the Local Vory, where ever your campaign may take place. He's an imposing ork with brown hair, grey eyes and a bullet scar on his right cheek where he was shot, many years ago.   Kirov is a ruthless man, who has no respect for human life. He is also a violent man, and is not above using it as as power tactic to get his point across.   For example, to make sure the runners wouldn't talk about the job, he had a former informant eaten alive by dozens of rats Dishonoured Style. He didn't even mentiion it or acknowledge the screams of the poor bastard until one of the runners asked what the fuck was going on. In a calm deep russian voice, he merely said:  ""We have been having a Rat problem of recently.""  It got the message across.  He is always flanked by his two troll Body Guards, Boris and Grigori, who are more than capable of ripping a few runners to shreds with their bare hands.   Kirov's jobs are ALWAYS dangerous, and ALWAYS loud. He hires runners to be the Hammer or the Scalpel in a plan. If he needs something done by force, he'll hire runners to do it and to send a message. If he needs something don by subterfuge, you can expect the Vory to provide a very helpful and explosive distraction for you.   He is a very powerful man in his sprawl, overseeing numerous drug operations, extortions, brothels and all manner of sinful delights. This makes him a very welcome ally, and a terrifying enemy. He will often offer the team a choice at the end of the run: forfeit the cash and take him as a conatct (6/2).  He can help the runners by providing favours, however he follows a strict tit-for-tat ideal, If you ask for help, you can expect to be asked to help at a later date. Don't say know if you want to keep all your fingers.  Kirov will often offer the runners weapons and large amounts of drugs instead of cash. His gun runners and drug smugglers often have a surplus that he can give to shadowrunners. (The street Value of the drugs is a couple grand more than JUST the pure cash option).  Despite his appearances, Sergei is an intelligent man, with a cunning business sense and steadfast Intuition. He can tell when someone is bullshitting him and when they're bluffing. He also doesn't like people asking about the scar."

This guy is Pink Mohawk Neo Anarchist to the bone. He's dressed in full Punk Leathers, with a massive blue mohawk (Thank Ghost for cyberhair) and a large flashing LED tattoo on his forehead that literally reads ""POOR IMPULSE CONTROL""  The guy lets this attitude into every part of his being, hamming up the fact that the mega corporations are the bane of metahumanity and how we need to break free of the chains that bind us to them.  ...which is all Bullshit, as he is being fed this information and personality via a P-Fix set to Max Neoanarchist. He's actually an undercover detective for KE who will always send runners on High Risk missions (hoping they die on the way) and leaving the drop off point to be a perfect set up for a Sting operation.   He will grumble at negotiations for more nuyen, but will cough up (As KE will confiscate that when they capture the runners for 'evidence' ). Perceptive runners can see through the performance if they get creative, or begin to dig too deeply into him.  He is recent to the neo-anarchist bar he frequents, he has no matrix presence, nobody actually knows him and if a decker was to hack his much too high rating internal commlink, they'd discover the BTL running on his brain.  He never sends runners on Wetworks, but likes Data Steals, Sabotages, Snatch and Grabs and other stuff that can be done that will hurt corps other than Ares.  (This guy is best played as a back up, or with a backup in mind, like if the Runners turn down a Johnson's job, squeeze a few months rent out of em to get em desperate and then send them this guy.)"

He is loyal to the Guldwyrm to a fault and under a lot of pressure to prove his loyalty and worth.   This J prefers to meet in some form of transportation, whether it be the city's monorail, on an empty bus or in the back of his Limo. Always moving, always alone and always in the wee hours of the night.  He will be sitting in a seat and will eventually become the only passenger remaining on the carriage/bus/whatever. When the team and Mr. J have privacy, he will welcome them with a guten Abend.   He's professional and calm, no mater what the runners throw at him (Thanks to his tiny magical ability taking shape in the form of 2 magic, both PP spent on Cool Resolve). He speaks with purpose and everyword is precise.  His jobs are often the most misleading and convoluted, to protect himself and the runner team. For example, when he needs a board of directors dead, instead of telling the runners this, he tells them to swap one of the board member's briefcases with one provided at a dead drop. He gives SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO NOT OPEN THE THING, because the thing has 2 Kilos of Plastique that is wired to detonate on opening, doing 50ish Physical damage.  Ouch.  His jobs are well paying, and if the runners are fine with his deceptions, then they have a lucrative career ahead of them.  He favours Wetwork, Sabotage, Data Steals, misdirections, espionage and deliveries- however the job is NEVER as it seems.  He will not betray a team that has use to him, however he will if they are no longer of use to him and know too much."

Smart as a whip, top of his class, destined for greatness until one day one of the upperclassmen jokingly dumped a bucket of pickle juice from the upper balcony, drenching poor James. The next day he was greeted with the name pickle, and as with anything strange and embarrassing that happens in our formative years, it stuck. For James though, it haunted him.  Everyone heard about Pickle and with his name came inevitable laughter and although he was smart, witty, and a hard worker for the corp he was never able to rise above the lowest levels of management. Well, now he is tired of it and is willing to hire outside help to work his way up. Targets of opportunity are the guys who ruined his life with a bucket of pickle juice but his main goal is UP!  Holly Street - Average woman in an average outfit with a large family.  What she wants is ""her"" inheritance, the way she wants to get it is to exploit a morality clause in her grandfather's irrevocable trust. Dozen's of people stand between her and total control and she is willing to lie, cheat, steal, and frame anyone who gets in her way.  William ""One Eye"" Eatton - Willy is an engineer. A retired engineer. A retired engineer with an old custom 2052 communications satellite in his garage that he was to launch into space. He is actually building a deployment vehicle and he wants you (the runners) to help him procure the parts he needs to complete his masterpiece.  Oh and the corps can't find out because if they do it will never get to space or it will be blown out of the sky.  If they don't find out though, think of all the free secure channel comms the players could use.  'enry 'Appleton (Henry Happleton) - A coffee magnate who wants you to do three simple deliveries for him. Henry is a short, over-weight, balding, middle-aged orc wearing a tweed suit and is always sipping an espresso or smoking a cigar. He talks out the side of his mouth and can't pronounce ""H""s because of a stroke he had a few years back. On a personality note, his shoes are never shiny but always immaculate and you never see him wear any pair twice. Anyway, so 'enry's three jobs are as follows: 1. Sneak into a Corp Enclave and switch out a locket for another one. The runners are to steal something while they are there to cover the true purpose, I would suggest some safe cracking or corporate espionage. 2. Break into a Beetle farm and set off 4 canisters of gas. Don't worry, they won't hurt you or the Beetles. 3. Break into a Premier Vases Incorporated, subsidiary of Aztechnology, to try to steal a shipment of high-quality crystal Holographic Vases (they project holograms of 100's of types of flowers inside of them, as well as provide scents stimuli for people with the right bioware implants.)  In actuality, the runners can keep/sell the vases, but they are given a datastick that contains a hack that they are supposed to use at the loading terminal during the run.  This hack will select the proper container and load it onto a waiting truck which they are to use to haul the vases out.  In actuality Henry's jobs are doing three completely different things. The first job (Locket) is getting an electronic key to an encrypted safe (in the matrix) which holds a series of recipes to his largest SoyCafe competition. The Second Job is really just neutralizing the pigment that the beetles are used to produce (Cochineal, yeah it is a real thing). This is the largest Cochineal supplier in the world.  It will mean that the Red dye used in the SoyCafe Canned drinks will be unavailable for months or even years. The Third job is all about them using that hacking program. It will go in, search around, and find the metal and glass molding system and introduce a small error in their bottles. Shaving off millimeters of glass on one side to cause cracking when dropped after being cooled. You know, like when being ordered from a vending machine. These three seemingly non-sensible runs will end up doubling Mr. Happleton's company stock and seriously hurt two of his competitors."

She has money to burn and has decided that hiring her own pet runners is exciting and adventurous. Her runs revolve around trivial things in her life, like getting back at her ex-husband by screwing over his career or stealing beautiful baubles she just has to have but can't purchase legally for whatever reason. Her knowledge of running comes straight out of the trids, and she'll do her incompetent best to help, offering outlandishly complicated ideas and possibly even trying to get herself involved in part of the run. As I said, the runs are usually oriented towards trivial goals, but due to the upper echelon social circles Foxy runs in security is likely to be much tighter than the runners might expect. If it weren't for her expert team of security personnel she'd probably be dead already, but mommy and daddy have significant assets to fund her lifestyle.

Shadowrun,3csfcl,Dallico,2,Fri Jul 10 15:45:20 2015 UTC,"Jesus Aguilar, Aztechnology Security Consultant  Jesus (pronounced Hesus), is one of Aztechnologies security managers in the Seattle area. He has a decent bit of ware, and despite the fact that he looks like a bruiser, he is also very cunning. Able to handle his own in a fight he often shows up to his own meets, usually with his personal bodyguards as well, and isn't afraid to get a little rough if the runner's give him trouble.   The jobs he gives aren't the usual security or jobs for the corp, but are generally more of a personal vein. We're talking assassination, kidnappings, and things like that. While he's usually hush hush on the details, occasionally things slip out unintentionally. Most of the people stolen away are usually linked to mages in some way, often to the darker paths. Why he's stealing them away, or killing others, is up for debate, but in truth his motivations are a lot more moral than one expects.  In truth Jesus is desperately trying to fight the spread of the dark paths of magic, and the things that go bump in the night, through cunning strategy. A kidnapping might prevent a mage from going down a path they can't return from, an assassination might target the head of a group to make them weaker. A small poke might guide a group down a path to their inevitable destruction, or greatly weaken them later on. All that's important is that Jesus is the one guiding the things that go bump in the night to their destruction, even blood mages from his own corp if need be."

Shadowrun,3csfcl,FloobyBadoop,2,Fri Jul 10 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"This is a random NPC generator I keep in my Shadowrun folder. If you're looking for inspiration for creating random Johnsons, I'd like to be so cocky as to say you could do worse.  Based on your description, however, I get the feeling you're looking less for Johnsons per say and more for Off-Colour and Interesting Run Provider.   If that's true, an easy way to do that is with baby steps.   Start with your standard run, standard Johnson, and standard target. Then add one small detail to each. A job from a corporate shark of a Johnson to extract a willing person from one corp to another, could become a job from a corporate shark with a passion for big game game hunting, to extract an animal from a zoo to the wilderness.   Next, add a special requirement to the job. In this case, a pay deduction should any harm come to the animal, or if any security is killed during the run.  Lastly, add both a complication and a secret motivation. Perhaps the animal has already been abused, without the Johnson's knowing of it. The team's pay will be deducted if they try to free it in its current state. Perhaps the animal is actually a shapeshifter, trapped in its current form by constant drug injections.   As for the secret motivation, this can be on the Johnson's side, or the players. The Johnson may seem to be benevolent, but he might be later hunting this animal down, and mounting its head over his fireplace. Perhaps the shapeshifter will make the players an offer of equivalent or better value than what the Johnson is offering in exchange for its relocation to a quiet midwestern suburb.  This approach has helped me when I'm writer's blocked a number of times, and I hope it works for you.  Otherwise, I hope the random NPC generator below will help with what you're looking for.

Shadowrun,3csfcl,Kromaek,2,Fri Jul 10 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"This is the Johnson I use for the primary plot of my groups current campaign.  Major (ret.) Zacharias Drossel A veteran of the russian front of the Eurowar, he nowadays owns the Verlorener Posten, a bar and meeting point for local vets in Offenbach. Since security in the area usually amounts to an aerial police drone making a pass every hour-ish, they also provide a local militia, keeping the other residents safe and the gangs down. Aside from some nice augs he has a quite a few connections to people he either served with or met during his service, forming a small but capable network that can be a great boon to the runners if they're able to establish a lasting partnership with him. Speaking of the runners, he needed the group (two shamans, a MysAd, a rigger and a paraplegic decker present via relay) because a new gang moved in on the vets' turf to stake a claim for themselves. Said gang offered an ""opportunity to discuss the matter in a civilized manner"" after a few not-so-random acts of violence (think the beginning of Dredd). He specifically wanted a bunch of awakened people for an escort in order to have some firepower in reserve while also avoiding to look too aggressive by bringing in lots of guns. Which was also what he told the group, wanting to be as upfront as possible. Of course, he neglected to mention that the ""gang"" was actually the Vory, looking to get a foothold in the Groß-Frankfurt area. After the inevitable breakdown of negotiations (turns out the Johnson and the Vory boss know each other, go figure) and an impromptu defense of the bar (the boss did not appreciate the murder of his ""negotiators"") the runners are likely to be utilized in what is eventually going to be an all out turf war. Good times.  Of course, the NPC that won the hearts of the players was Oberfeldwebel (ret.) Matthäus ""Matze"" Wotjek, the bartender. He gives you beer (sometimes even the real deal), SoyCaf and even a story when he's in a charitable mood. He's also a 9 feet tall bear. With a shotgun. 'nuff said."
Shadowrun,3csfcl,Rongeong,2,Fri Jul 10 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"Some of the Johnsons from the game I GM. I hope they can be helpful even if you only take parts of them.  The Cheated Ork:  This guy was one of two tutorial jobs I had them run to get a feel for the game. He worked at a high end club taking care of the audio and visual equipment. He meets the runners in a maintenance area at the club he works at. His in game description ""If it weren't for the tusks, you wouldn't know this guy was an ork. He's one of the scrawniest orks you've ever seen. Thick glasses frame his pasty face and a mop of messy hair sits atop his head. A red trident logo(the logo of the club) is emblazoned on the right breast of his black wind breaker. He appears to be trying to look calm, keyword is trying. If he was wearing boots he'd be shaking in them.""  His wife is cheating on him and he wants them to kill both her and her lover. He stumbles over his words often and is easy to frighten. He wants photos of the dead bodies and will break down in tears when he sees them. He has arranged to work late that night to encourage his wife to get the lover to come over. When the runners get there they find his hot elf wife entertaining four gangers in the bedroom.  An Angry Victim:  The other tutorial job I had my runners to do. She's never done this sort of thing before and got an idea from a spy movie on how to have her runners contact her. The fixer gives them a passphrase that they need to speak and await the right reply. They met Ms. Johnson at the place of her work(like I said, new to dealing with shadowrunners), a small restaurant called Paul's Cafe. She's a waitress and the runners will find a both large enough for the party that the fixer will tell them about.  The description I gave her for my runners “An ork woman approaches the table. Her faded brown jacket hangs open and both sleeves are rolled up to the elbow. You would be able to see her facial tattoos if her face wasn't twisted in fury. You get the feeling that she may never have felt happiness in her entire life.”  Her mother was part of an urban tribe descended from maori and her father was sioux. So her tattoos are a mixture of both. She speaks with a heavy accent and is majorly frustrated with what happened to her. A prostitute she hired stole a small totem from her. The totem was carved by her late father for her late mother when they were dating. She does not want the prostitute, Samantha, harmed. The idea of violence doesn't sit well with her, but she won't know it was the runners if Samantha takes a tumble onto a few bullets. When the totem is returned Ms. Johnson will break down and thank the runners endlessly. It's a simple operation but it was meant to get my runners use to the game.  The Hunted Dwarf:  When the runners arrive at the bar their main fixer is at, they'll see him talking to a young dwarf woman. He'll send her to the bar and wave the runners over. He just got a job that they'll be perfect for. He'll bring the dwarf woman back and leave the table so they can discuss business. Her in game description was “The young woman can't be more than nineteen. Worry tinged with fear is etched on her youthful face. Her clothes are simple; a brown jacket, blue jeans, and a pair of worn sneakers. She sits in a chair Getz(the fixer) provided her at the end of the table.” She's nervous but determined, she doesn't stutter but will hesitate on things that are less than savory. She'll tell the runner that her uncle needs protection and will provide the main details and the upfront payment.  She'll take the runners out to a two story building in the barrens. Once inside she'll ask for help moving a bookcase behind which is a door. She knocks on the door and I read my runners the following “ The door creaks open and weary eyed dwarf pokes his head out along with the tip of Roomsweeper. He spots Mrs. Johnson and she nods to him. Lowering the gun he emerges from a bathroom. Inside you can spot a small stack of books and empty food containers. He strokes his short greying beard nervously.” He's seen a lot in his life and it's pretty clear this isn't the first time he's dealt with shadowrunners, he may even have been one at one point in his life. His voice is tired and he knows how to negotiate.  He's an alchemist and he tells the runners about his last trip out gathering reagents at an overgrown park in a different part of the barrens. He was astrally perceiving when he came across dark spirit in the distance. Shortly there after he was jumped by a group of gangers. The gangers have been hunting him ever since. He pays the runners to kill of the gangers and escort him to a dock where a smuggler will get him out of town.

What he doesn't know is that the gangers, The Dark Rails, are working for the spirit. The mage leader of the gang works for the spirit in a trade for power and spirit wants the witness removed. The runners needed to locate the gang hideout and take them all out. I had the gang meeting up at an abandoned open air metro station...my runners got there well before the gangers normally meet up to cause trouble and rigged it with enough explosives to turn it and the abandoned Stuffer Shack nearby into rubble.

Role: Media talent acquisition  Corp affiliation:  Horizon  (not directly, but one of their Seattle agents.)  Company of employ: U62, small local Seattle trideo station focusing on content for children entertainment programming.      Description:  Egotistical, pompous, confident talent scout / middle manager. Age 32, Human male, 1.87 meters, strong physique, swagger, oily smile. Doesn’t like to be told no. Often has leverage or dirt on individuals to convince them to do what he wants. When he doesn’t, he tends to steamroll people into doing his bidding. Negotiation pool of 15, physical pools of 9 (combat 7). Would prefer to offer the characters an actual contract, requiring a SIN from the runners.  Prefers his meals at expensive locations (and liquid, usually).  Meets typically go down in places that have security already built in, favorite meeting place is the restaurant at the Space Needle.  Combines Shadowrun meetings with lunch meetings, works a 12 to 14 hour day.  Rides his support staff very hard (they work 14-16 hour days with only a lunch break), minorly condescending to them.  Doesn't have deep pockets, but does collect from the authorized amounts to spend on the run.  As such, he lives a higher lifestyle than it would seem he could afford.  He also has a bias against Technomancers and mages of the Christian or Catholic school.

In fact, it’s unclear what his beliefs actually are, though they seem Christian, at least. Not that it matters to Bob. It’s definitely not his real name. And a few moments of conversation with him, over some craft brews sometimes, you’ll realize the man has had quite the life. Though he’s not willing to share much if he just met you.  The jobs aren’t all the same. Sometimes he needs some gangs redirected--not killed or bribed away--but turned away. He’ll intercede on behalf of his flock. Don’t let the humble appearance fool you, he can pay solid nuyen. Perhaps not as much as you’d like but the jobs he offers are clean and, dare I say it, usually good. If you find an angle other than altruism let me know.     Mr. Harrison  An archaeologist straight out of the trids, Mr. Harrison is an old fashioned free thinker. He’s also more than a little happy to break the law along the way to recovering important historical artifacts for his university’s collection. Lately he’s branched into art as well, not just historical pieces too. He hires “liberators” and pays quite well, ostensibly a share from the actual price of said items.  It’s worth it since he still pays above average rates. Plus, there aren’t that many ways in with the academic crowd unless you already are one. Get in his good graces, do the jobs quietly and well, and you can have someone you can ask about ancient elven crap. Note: he carries a Ruger Super Warhawk and is a damned surgeon with it.      Mrs. Johnson  She looks like she’s in her late 20s early 30s. Definitely shaped to look like an elf without the ears, but she’s human and well into her 60s. Word is she was the trophy wife of some grey market baron. Ask around some more and you’ll know she’s the one that’s been calling the shots for the last three decades.   Most of it had been taken from her by her late husband’s son (with the first or second wife). Bitter war so far, with everything from straight out wetwork and structure hits to subtle work like rerouting shipping and other untraceable malfunctions. No one wants to get involved since the two are geniuses with logistics--it hasn’t really affected everyone else’s business that much. But the ol’ Mrs. Johnson’s a wily one. Things have been scaling back recently and her younger rival is taking it to mean she’s gotten soft after a few nasty hits. One of them’s about to be very disappointed.     Alston Travers  This traveling salesman looks like a walking cliche. You’d laugh him off if he weren’t so damned effective and friendly. Not Awakened, not even augmented. In a more mundane world he’d be the spokesman for any major company or a powerful politician. He owns a sizeable and so far independent marketing company.   He’d like to keep it independently owned. Behind that UV-bright smile is a ruthless and calculating man. He does, however, reserve that for his rivals. The jobs are esoteric and, dare I admit it, fun. Heard of Swank? That fancy new drink that’s supposed to change the way we drink or some drek? Well, there was an impromptu “breakdown” of several delivery vans that just so happened to break down in front of average looking consumers. Yep, another so-called “viral vid” about how great the drink was. That was a rival company’s marketing campaign, and he lost out on both the contract and the plan. So, we hired our own average looking bozos to hang in these areas and take the drink. You remember now? Utter PR disaster. That rival marketing company went under and the corp making Swank hired him on to rebrand the drink to Flave. And you know you love Flave."

He's a fair and reasonable leader in this regard, and he rarely has to deal with insubordination because he gives the gangers a sizable cut of his profits. He's also an expert decker, always has his ear to the street, and shops around whatever corporate secrets he can pick up. Corps sometimes approach him when they need runners because of his connection to the streets, so he works as a fixer when he doesn't have a job of his own to offer.  He basically looks like this guy, but minus the monkey and with a big long bushy beard (he's a dwarf, fyi) tied into 10 neat braids.

Fixers are the main point of contact for Runners to get jobs, kinda like a Hollywood agent. An intermediary between Runner mercenaries for hire, and employers offering work. Johnsons (named so b/c it's an anonymous name they can use to prevent giving away who they really are and where they're really from) are usually a Corp employee or something, who comes to a Fixer and says ""I need a job done"". Then the Fixer goes through his list of Runner contacts and says ""I know just the guys for the job.""  btw... I didn't downvote ya. But I think this is why the anonymous downvoter did. =)"

They're just the middleman between Runners and jobs. They know a lot of Runners, and they know a lot of Johnsons.  ""Johnson"" is an anonymous name used by an employer looking to hire Runners for a job. If they choose to use a different name, that's fine. If they give their real name, that's fine too. But they represent a Corp, a business, in some way they represent a job opportunity. It may be continuing employment working for their interests.  But what you initially described as a problem solver either sounds like a Runner for hire, or a Fixer who finds Runners. The Johnsons would be the ones coming to you with problems to solve."
Shadowrun,3csfcl,Xarian0,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"Anyone can be a Johnson by not giving their name. Anyone can need a Runner for any reason. Basic security is a small thing, but if the nuyen is good and the job is pretty low key, aren't they the good ones? If you're a Runner at least.   Fixer makes things go, happen. Why can't a character be both?   The trick to making great characters, NPC's, is giving them things to do and chase after. A 'fixer' may have a job that they are working on the side, trying to find the right Runners for it. So they would be both the Johnson and the Fixer for their own private goals. All they have to do is say that there is an unnamed benefactor, ie not them.   A 'Johnson' may have a reason he is keeping their name, job title under wraps. Corrupt cop pursuing an agenda, or a clean cop trying to dig them. Johnson's may be anything from Lone Star detectives through to corp heavy weights. They may be from the military or never held a gun in their lives.   Seeing a person just doing one thing is a little silly. People aren't like that. They have different aspects to them. Bring a little of that to the tabletop and you have more interesting characters for it. That and being a little boring. Most people are in fact, quite well adjusted and have decent childhoods.   I've done some research into some very interesting fields and how Shadowrun does break things up, is a little silly at times. Roles can cross over very quickly. Especially if you know how certain a certain great game actually works. At least, from the Russian side and a fair chunk of that is probably unverifiable.   Which makes me think of something I should have added to the Best and Worst of Shadowrun. The idea of such a structured systems for hiring in effect, criminals.   When I finally get around to posting some stuff on Obsidian Portal, the stuff that has gone into some of the NPC's is..... worrying and I feel needs a certain disclaimer about resemblance, real or imagined etc."
Shadowrun,3csfcl,oldhatgm,2,Fri Jul 10 18:20:07 2015 UTC,"Nobody said that you can't mix roles. It happens all the times: fixers very commonly hire runners for personal jobs, making them Johnsons as well. Runners do this, too. For example, in Firefly, when Simon (the street doc) hires the runners (Mal & crew) to hit the hospital on Ariel. The problem here is that you seem to be misunderstanding the fundamental aspect of 'Johnson': hiring someone to do a job while keeping your own hands clean.  The way that you described the character, though, is about 99% Fixer and 1% Johnson.   He advertises his services as a problem solver. If you have a problem, he's the one to solve it. He prefers to work in...... acquisitions. If you need something, something, he will recover it.    Fixers advertise their services. Johnsons have somethat they need done, and they go looking for services (Fixer or otherwise).   Rather in this case, the project he's been assigned to acquire is about nanotechnology. Both in a medical use (rebuilding the nervous system, one nanobot at a time. Break in your spine, a flexible circuit to restore the connection etc) and its use in enhancements, augmentations. Namely military grade enhancements and potentially even flexible ones.    You're describing the fixer's current job. Who hired him and why? Is he a free agent, doing a job for another party (making him a pure fixer) or is he doing this out for personal/loyalty/company employment (Fixer/Johnson combo)?   He works through building networks and networks of networks. He keeps tracks of many Runners and builds teams when required. Some of the time he even has Runners on retainer. That way he knows he has a team just when he needs it and doesn't need to find, negotiate with on pay and perform some background checks on.    This is essentially the definition of a fixer."
Shadowrun,3csfcl,Xarian0,-2,Fri Jul 10 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"If you don't me asking, why do you need the roles to be so separate?  By that logic, no Johnson ever knows a Runner. They absolutely require Fixers to step in for them. If you have any sort of Johnson contact, he's either really a Fixer or the Runner is also a Fixer. In fact, might not even count as a Runner then.   Which, the more codified, stratified the role of Runner, Fixer and Johnson, are much more difficult to explain. Not only explain, but to keep to. The Shadows in which Runners live is an ever changing, ever fluid community of professional problem solvers to outright repeat criminals. They're not assassins, there's a book which says otherwise. Neither are they soldiers and mercenaries, they're not as adaptable or flexible as Runners are. They are an interesting lot with varied and interesting skills.  Runners can be Fixers and Johnsons in their own right. It's a sliding spectrum that is very fluid and I will play it is as such. Especially with the insight I've had towards the Great Game. If you're not familiar with the term, might I recommend looking at some material on espionage. Spies, on a whole and across the board, do not in fact, kill each other. It's bad form in the first instance and see above about vendettas.   It's why I don't like the ideas of Runners just killing each other. They're the point end of a very long line of contacts, friends and associates. The moment you start killing, vendettas. Entire organisations get destroyed, assets that have taken years to establish get wiped out from being caught in the crossfire."

I completely understand that you as a fan of the original shadowrun games not liking this installment. The one thing I have to say to you is, it could've been a good turn for the company. I believe this, because it wasn't the original games it was a spin off that applied to different addiance. That addiance being my friends, FPS fans, and more. It could've started a new side series for the company that could've branched into another production team in the studio. Now we all know it didn't happen, but I believe the game had great mechanism. To each there own though."

My character Friedrich, a aristocratic technomancer who started shadowrunning out of necessity, developed a relationship with Bianca. She was the boss of a secret organization called MANTEIA that employed multiple shadowrun teams. She was also the runaway daughter of one of the baddies from that campaign, Paul Friedeman, head of the Teutonic Order. When our team got a mission in Dreistadt (Tricity), Bianca traveled with us. On that trip, Friedrich and Bianca expressed their love for eachother. But it wasn't to last long. Somewhere in the war-zone that was Dreistadt, she got caught in the crossfire and died in Friedrich's arms. Friedeman witnessed her getting shot and tried to avenge the death of his estranged daughter at the end of the campaign.  It's still an emotional topic for my character, even in the follow-up campaign we're playing now."

It was a fun little story though
Shadowrun,3cobsx,VendettaViolent,5,Thu Jul 9 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"Vendetta Violent, behind her bluster and pomp is actually a bit of a lonely romantic. It's one of the characters little tragedies as she is convinced that she can't really have any sense of a normal life between being a rock star and moonlighting as a shadowrunner. But she's too hard to really admit much of that (though she has covered it in her shadowblog once or twice). It's something a lot of shadowrunners seem to be plagued with. I guess it comes with the territory of being in a 'profession' where it can sometimes be hard to make it to retirement age.  Lucid, my other character is surprisingly kind of falling for a fellow runner in her own way. She's an emotionless, ultra-professional cyber assassin who is trying to find what's left of her soul. In so doing, she has kind of taken a protective role over one of the other runners in the group (who is all of the things she isn't). I figure her care in his safety is what passes for affection with her. I kind of like the fact that she can't really feel things like a normal woman and is kind of confused that she might actually have feelings for this screw up, feelings that she'll likely never be able to properly realize.  Then again, Shadowrun is just an awesome setting for this sort of character tragedy (which I am ever so fond of). Side bonus is that it gives your character a human side without having to really deal with what can be awkward table behavior (at least for me, as I got older this sort of RP got less appealing for me to play out)"

Also the entire team is kinda afraid of her, so...   Though there is kinda an NPC on NPC romance going on at the sidelines, that somewhat came out of nowhere.

They both ended up in the hospital and, after a fairly brief period under Doc Wagon's ministrations, they both hit up a basement Runner dive bar for drinks. They got supremely buzzed on cheap synthahol, went back to Sho's safehouse, and decided to stress-screw each other's brains out.

Another interesting pair is my spec ops elf who is super short for an elf and usually keeps her hair in a two foot pink mohawk to make up the difference who paired up with his dwarf rigger who is the epitome of a grumpy old man, even though he is only in his early 30s, and really likes his porn.

Best to keep things professional, especially with your team mates.  Dropping character for a bit if it fits your story go ahead, but I think with Shadowrun's themes such things would be the exception rather than the rule. The entire would itself is so cruel and dehumanizing that it's hard to imagine there being a room for actual love anywhere, let alone among runners. As such you could build a very cool story around it if you wished but it shouldn't be common IMO."
Shadowrun,3cobsx,StarMagus,2,Thu Jul 9 14:30:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know, at least half of the original characters from the Never Deal with A Dragon series of novels found ""love"".  Dodger fell for an AI, Kham the Orc has a wife and kids, Twist ended up with an elven mage I think...  The only 2 who didn't ((as far as I know)) are Sally Tsung and The Ghost.  Double Checked, the wiki for the novels showed that Sally got involved with both Ghost and Twist, but I was sure Twist ended up with another mage after her.     Found it!   Twist and Hart settled down together after Twist lost his magic."
Shadowrun,3cobsx,HorizonConsensus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:37:22 2015 UTC,"Well, that was back in the days of first or second edition wasn't it? Back then the setting was much more Neuromancer-like than it is in the current edition, and Neuromancer had a major sub-theme of forbidden (or at least heavily discouraged) as well as lost love.  I feel like 5e has thematics more in line with our own modern societal issues, with the increasing shallowness and narcissism of the masses being one of the major ones. To keep in line with that thematic and the general cynicism of the setting I feel like at least when I run the game true, actual love (rather than hollow ""hey, let's be a couple so we can rise in the social ranks""-kinda love) would be exceedingly rare.  But all that means really is that if you do decide to tell a love story within the Shadowrun setting it will be all that much more dramatic. It sets up a story of love conquers all better than just about any other kind of setup could, I think, so if that's the story you want to tell the setting is actually working with you rather than against you."
Shadowrun,3cobsx,StarMagus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:07:57 2015 UTC,"Oh I could see Runners being cynical about love, but by the same token I'd imagine they end up hooking up with each other very often just by taking examples of other people who work in high stress life threatening environments.   By the same token I'd imagine drinking, drug use, and suicide would be insanely high among runners, as well as PTSD cases.  That said humans are humans, be they from the 0's the 1000's or as far as 2075 or so.    Love is an emotion humans have grappled with for our entire existence, to think they wouldn't in the near future is crazy."
Shadowrun,3cobsx,HorizonConsensus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:10:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think of hooking up as love. I mean, it could involve love but it doesn't have to, and runners overall strike me as a group that would sleep around a lot without getting attached.  I mean, obviously the setting is full of sex. But love? That's an entirely different issue.   That said humans are humans, be they from the 0's the 1000's or as far as 2075 or so. Love is an emotion humans have grappled with for our entire existence, to think they wouldn't in the near future is crazy.   Well, there's a society around the humans that puts that love into context. What we think of as love today is not what a person would think of as love in the middle ages. There would be similarities, of course, but it wouldn't be the same. The expectations of what love means would be entirely different, and that would colour your perception of the entire phenomenon. You were expected to love the person you were forcefully arranged married to. To our modern ears that sounds insane, but it was the way it was back then. By the same token a child growing up in the Shadowrun 2070s would have an expectation of what love is that is shaped and coloured by the society around them, and it's a society that puts you the individual above all and values appearances above emotions and deep bonds. They'd think that their, to us very shallow and vapid, relationships are ""love"" but the concept is not the same as the one we are used to.  And I'm not saying that love wouldn't exist, but rather that it would be rare to find love that looks like the love we are used to. It's a dehumanising setting, and what better way to illustrate that than changing what it means to be in love to something that is horrible to our eyes?"
Shadowrun,3cobsx,StarMagus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't imagine ""We're just having no strings attached sex"" would work out better in the future than it does now.

Shadowrun,3cobsx,HorizonConsensus,2,Thu Jul 9 15:18:06 2015 UTC,"I imagine they wouldn't be having sex with their actual team mates. It's highly unprofessional, if nothing else. But on the other hand many runners should have no problem picking someone up at a bar and those that do probably know all the best brothels anyway since that's the circles they move in. Like I said, sex is everywhere, but sex doesn't necessarily mean love.  See also my edit in response to your edit about how love as a concept can and does change with time."
Shadowrun,3cobsx,StarMagus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:22:32 2015 UTC,"I would think that they would in fact be having sex with members of their own team.  Look at what happens when you have any other high stress profession and you have units of mixed genders ((or even the same genders)) ..... sex.  Why do you think most militaries have rules against people in the same unit having sex?  Because without hard and fast rules with massive penalties people are going to screw those that are around them.   Even that doesn't stop them.  I think there is a difference in how society views love, but the human biological reactions of love aren't going to change.  Love is very much about chemicals and the like being released by your body and your brain chemistry.   Sure there could be implants to control that, but I can't see a mage or street Sammy wasting essence to get that sort of item instead of something more worthy of what they do."
Shadowrun,3cobsx,HorizonConsensus,2,Thu Jul 9 15:26:03 2015 UTC,"We don't even know how that chemical reaction really works. It mostly certainly doesn't last our entire lives, and in fact I'd argue that it seems like it's actually set up contrary to the way we view love as something permanent and life-long. We are not biologically meant to be monogamous, and our brains and genetics reflect that fact, yet our society is built around the idea that love and monogamy are intertwined. If anything the chemicals behind it seem to be a lot more about lust than love. Those two things can be related, but they aren't necessarily so.  But ultimately I think that Shadowrun is a dystopia and as a dystopia its themes should reflect that fact. It's not very dystopic to me if love is still alive and well and all around. In a dystopia love should be rare, borderline forbidden, and highly improbable. It's part of what makes the genre, in my opinion. It increases the theme of dehumanisation in a way that nothing else can, and it also makes the love stories you do decide to tell all that much more interesting and exciting than otherwise.  Like I said I'm not saying that love shouldn't exist in Shadowun: I'm just saying it should be rare. Much rarer than it is in real life."
Shadowrun,3cobsx,StarMagus,2,Thu Jul 9 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"That's a perfectly valid way to view the game, however the current version of Shadowrun is only 25 years from 2050 where by the novels there was literally love all around, even for runners.

I know, a bike does NOT handle the SAME as a motorbike, and it's not the SAME kind of muscles/stamina you need as for running, but SR tends to generalize: You get Longarms and shoot rifles and shotguns with it. You get Pilot Aircraft and pilot fixed wings and rotor based vehicles with it.

Shadowrun,3crfb5,sericatus,9,Fri Jul 10 04:16:25 2015 UTC,"Shadowrun is a setting that makes tabletop a breeze. The entire concept of shadowrunners makes setting up parties actually make sense, you can have 2-6 people from all walks of life team up and interact and there's no need to justify it, that's just how the biz works.   The GM can wrap the players up in complicated conspiracies all he likes, he has a wealth of organizations and public figures to bring into the campaign, and can pretty much set the limit at his imagination what with metaplanar journeys and UV-hosts. The opposition has limitless resources to throw at the party if necessary, but it still makes sense that the players can spit in their eye and walk away on a weekly basis.  Some people abhor the crunch, but I'm glad they put the systems in there to be used if necessary. Our table eased our way in, adopting more and more of the rules as we got more and more comfortable with them.  The biggest weakness is the editing, which isn't something Shadowrun corners the market on either. It makes some bits difficult to grasp intuitively because some rules conflict with others, while some make no sense at all (I'm looking at you, vehicle crash rules!). It's also difficult to quickly reference rulings (even with the plethora of cheat sheets available) and leads to a lot of off-the-cuff GM calls in the moment even when there are applicable rules in place."
Shadowrun,3crfb5,D_Keller,3,Fri Jul 10 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"I think the setting as a whole is the upside. You can basically run any mission / campaign you can imagine. If you want to be all about technology, there's lots of machines and cyborgs. If you want to be all about magic, there's lots of spells and Spirits. If you want computer stuff, there's hackers and mainframes. One mission you're infiltrating a classified Corp lab to steal data and prototypes for the competition. The next mission, you're exploring ancient ruins looking for forgotten artifacts. The way it's organized / edited is definitely a downside. These books pretty much require having them on PDF, so you can Ctrl+F to find what you're looking for in the first place. The rules are scattered all over the book, sometimes parts of a rule will be in the middle of something else. Or the rule for something basic is in a completely different book, forcing you to own a complete library before you can play the game.   For instance, the Core talks about owning a Flashlight (even some of the pre-gens have one). But the only way you can extrapolate what a Flashlight actually does for you, is by deciphering it from the description for the FN P93 Praetor SMG. Or by buying Run & Gun, which actually gives a writeup.  BTW... huge handfuls of d6's give you varying odds. If you have a 1:6 chance of failure, and a 1:3 chance of success... the more dice you have to roll, the more likely you are to succeed overall. Especially when you factor in 1/2 failures = glitch, only rolling a few dice means even if you succeed, you could still glitch."

The Bad: The Matrix! That comes from someone who plays a Dwarf TM and fcking loves to play him. It is overly complex, not well explained in the Books - most of the Fluff in other Books still talk about Nodes (which do not exist anymore in 5e outside of Foundations) and needs more houseruling calls than anything else in this damned thing. It also really doesn't help if half the table refuses to read the chapter of the Corebook. *ugh And after I read the chapter twice I still had to crawl through dozens of threads in various Forums to get a grasp of what works, what doesn't, what were the intentions, and so on ... some say the Limit is your imagination! But in the end it just means the rules tell you sh**t and half of what you want to do starts with the Question to your GM ""I'd like to do that. Is it okay and what should I roll?"" - To which he usually replies ... ""I dunno ... uhm ... just roll a d6. When you get a hit it works today.""  It is nothing but frustrating !

Shadowrun,3crfb5,Daihatschi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:24:30 2015 UTC,"Best feature of Shadowrun, well features.   It naturally sets up the party and party mechanic. You're Runners on a job. End of statement. You have to do the job. Some of the time they're easy, other times quite hard. You've been given one hell of a world to have at your fingertips as a game runner and to explore as a player.   For me the rest of it boils down to the freedom it offers. Being classless, you have plenty of options of what and how you want to do it. Cyber troll, Elf Face, you can try to contract out or you can do it yourself.   Perhaps the worst part of it is the dense nature of some of the rules. You have a lot of different rules to cover lots of different situations. Too many in my mind. Especially if you play something with a decker and mage, including Astral and Matrix combat according to the book, with meatspace combat as well.   There's too many traps and it needs some simplification, consistency across the combat modes.   The other weakness in my mind is the fact that it doesn't....... quite keep up with technology. SR5 really introduced the wireless, but there's plenty of aspects about it I can't help but go about it in the wrong way. There's elements of its IT technology and systems that are positively out of WW2.   It needs a clean up and some IT system designers, database engineers to come in and point out these areas. Maybe even some people who specialise in designing wifi/wireless technologies."

Shadowrun,3crfb5,PinkTrench,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:28:29 2015 UTC,Something that has bugged me for a while is the imbalance in advancement opportunity between magic and tech characters.

Shadowrun,3cqkfm,MagicalTrog,4,Thu Jul 9 23:50:02 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, you've crippled yourself in order to use heavy machineguns, but can't run with one out of chargen (availability 16F) and in a street campaign are going to have a hell of a time affording one and finding a contact who even has a chance of acquiring one.  A rating 1 fake sin isn't going to get you anywhere. A criminal SIN means your magic-ness and everything else about you is on file and you can expect random check-ups, plus you don't have a license for your magic so I'm not sure how that is supposed to work. On top of that is the notoriety you get from it, and you had better not leave any traces of your magic or blood or whatnot at any crime scenes.  You're almost completely ineffective with the only weapon you leave Chargen with (telescopic baton). Your drain dice are low enough that you're likely to eat worrying amounts of stun damage every time you cast. Your composure dice are too low to have a decent chance of shaking off your mentor spirit's urge to berserk in combat. You have no way of getting around. You can't conjure spirits."

Shadowrun,3cqkfm,xcbsmith,2,Fri Jul 10 22:14:57 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity... why not go with a Mystic Adept? It seems like you could then use some PP's to boost up some of those physical attributes the way you'd like it, but in a more karma efficient fashion. For example, that +1 to Reaction that is costing you 10 karma need only cost you one level of ""Improved Physical Attribute"", which is 5 karma. That will help you slot down attributes even as low as the D slot."
Shadowrun,3cqkfm,xcbsmith,2,Sat Jul 11 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"Given your strength, I'd go for a helmet & ballistic mask at least. Maybe even a riot shield."
Shadowrun,3cqkfm,xcbsmith,2,Sat Jul 11 21:03:50 2015 UTC,"Okay, so here's what I came up with. Definitely not as strong, not quite as tough, but faster and harder to hit and I'd speculate tougher to kill.  Given that you went with Bear spirit, I thought it would be a crime to not at least get heal & increase willpower. You can summon a Spirit of Man with high enough Force to have it cast sustain spells like increased reflexes & increased willpower. I went weak on Spirit Binding, but figured it was worth the karma to have you at least know the basics on how to do that.  I went with a Mystic Adept to let you boost up some of those physical stats and abilities. You didn't get an Assensing skill, but I figure you might well be the only one in the party who might be able to see the Astral, so I burned a PP on astral perception and got you lvl 4 assensing. I burned some PP on Improved Ability for heavy weapons, so when you get your hands on them you'll be awesome. One level of combat sense makes you one of the harder trolls to hit with 8 defense dice, but more importantly with your high perception, makes it hard to be surprised. I thought about mystic armour, but I don't think it is worth the karma as compared to beefing up your combat sense. Defense dice are effectively soak dice that give you a chance of just not getting hit at all.  Gave you some adrenaline boost so you could get out in front and even have a shot at 3 attacks per round, even without Increased Reflexes, and with all that Body & Willpower, the drain pretty much bounces off of you.  I stuck with your stunbolt, though direct spells stink so bad (unless you have witness my hate) that I'd be tempted to dump it at put two more levels in adrenaline boost instead.  Since strength is lower, I went with shock weapons (nice advantage of taking some of the initiative off of opponents too), including a riot shield, though I didn't burn a skill slot for it so it's mostly useful for protection.  I'm not a fan of criminal SIN's, but I figure you have your reasons for wanting to play it that way, so I stuck with that, but added some more behavioural issues to make him more interesting.  Given a Charisma of 1, I figure you have to take some basic Con & Etiquette to avoid automatically failing in simple social situations.  On the priority side, there'd be some win swapping Magic & Meta, but life is rough when you only have 1 edge.  Here we go:  Priorities: (A) Troll, (B) Mystic Adept, (C) Skills, (D) Attributes, (E) Resources  Attributes: Body 5(7), Agility 4, Reaction 2, Strength 6, Willpower 5, Logic 2, Intuition 5, Charisma 1, Edge 4, Magic 6  Mystic Adept Chaos Magic Tradition (10 soak dice, 12 for Adept drain)  Spells(7 + 1 extra): Chaotic World, Heal, Improved Invisibility, Increase Reflexes, Increase Willpower, Levitate, Stunbolt, Trid Phantasm  Powers: Adrenaline Boost 4, Astral Perception, Attribute Boost Agility 1, Combat Sense 1, Improved Ability Heavy Weapons 2, Improved Physical Attribute Body 2, Nimble Fingers  Qualities  Positive: Mentor Spirit - Bear  Negative: Criminal SIN, Mild Addiction to Kamikaze, Poor Self Control - Thrill Seeker  Skills (28 + 1 extra, 2 Groups, 2 lvl 4 Magic skills): Assensing 4, Binding 1, Clubs 1, Con 1 (Fast Talking +2), Counterspelling 6, Etiquette 1, Heavy Weapons 6(8), Perception 1 (Visual +2), Spellcasting 6 (Illusion + 2), Stealth Group 2, Summoning 6 (Spirit of Man +2)  Equipment: Swap out the telescoping staff for a stun baton. Add some flexibility on the armour side by getting enough gear for two set ups. On one hand, you can go hard core with Armor Jacket + the riot shield, or when you need to be more subtle, go lighter with the lined coat + helmet + ballistic mask. Stuff your sensors and such in the ballistic mask. You'll want to get a smart link once you get your hands on the heavy weapons. Also got you loaded up with some Kamikaze shots for really juicing your combat... and managing your addiction.  This set up seems reasonably ""geek the mage"" proof. If for whatever reason you go Berserk while on the Kamikaze and loaded up with your armour, I'd not want to be the guy that has to take you down."
Shadowrun,3cqkfm,xcbsmith,2,Sat Jul 11 22:18:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for this writeup. I did consider doing a mystic adept as it seemed to be intended for blending magic with physical abilities, but had a really hard time designing one that worked. Your example here is greatly appreciated.  I do have a few questions though if you don't mind:   I see you lowered the troll's strength down to 6. My original reason for pushing it to 10 was because it gave a 4 dice bonus to recoil compensation. This seemed important for when he is not doing suppressive fire with his heavy weapon, because machine guns give double negative modifiers for uncompensated recoil. Also, the rules state that MMGs need a STR of 8+ and HMGs need 10+ to be carried, so anything lower would make them unusable it seems. Are these major concerns, or is the recoil not as big of a deal as it seems. Also, are MMGs and HMGs not worth the attribute points to enable their usage? He can still wield assault cannons and LMGs with lower STR it seems. You said direct spells stink when referring to the choice of stunbolt. Would it be a good choice to replace it with something else? The only reason why I took it was to have a mana spell for dealing with spirits, or possibly to knock someone unconscious. The more I think about it, the more I think the criminal SIN might be a bad choice as well. My reason was that I figured this character would have had run ins with the law in the past, but that may be a bigger handicap then I though. I am going to find something to replace it. How significant is the loss of astral projection by going mystic adept? It seemed like a useful ability for prerun legwork and scouting, but I have limited experience in the game, and may be overvaluing it.    I am probably going to tweak a few things in your mystic adept build because my group is limited to just the core rulebook for now. However, the Chaos tradition I am going to try and get anyways because INT for drain seems like a very important aspect for this character.   Again, thanks for the help."
Shadowrun,3cqkfm,xcbsmith,2,Sun Jul 12 04:58:04 2015 UTC,"Updated: Added details about the differences between direct, indirect, and an assault cannon.    Since you mentioned assault cannon, I figured you were going for fewer bullets, more precision, so not MMG/HMG. ;-) Yup, you totally get a huge bonus for recoil compensation with that higher strength, and it is critical if you are going to go with MMG's or HMGs. Recoil is a big deal with those weapons and even LMG's. You can compensate for it a fair bit though (some HMGs come standard with a tripod for a reason). The question is how you want to do it. Lots of strength sure helps, but really tends to make more sense if you compliment that with strength based melee expertise. You can also gear it up (a gyro mount is just awesome). Or, you can take a simple or complex action to break up the firing, and with adrenaline boost you nearly get an entire extra action phase (and nimble fingers actually makes a few moves free actions too, so you should be able to burn a simple action on not firing). If you want to boost str for MMGs or HMGs, I'd go with shifting over that improved attribute skill to strength. If you want HMGs, you'll have to either burn up some more PP's from other skills, maybe switch attribute boost over to strength as well (so you can handle the HMG's for short periods of time), or get an Increase Strength spell. Don't forget... when he's on Kamikaze he's Strength 8. Direct spells have their moments, but really more for taking heavily armoured opponents (which of course does apply to spirits) without generating a ton of drain with high force spells (a Force 12 indirect spell is 12DV + AP -12, and can get a net hits DV bonus above that, so it can cut through a lot of spirit defenses... anyone with normal body armour better just run and hide), and AOE indirects have the advantage of only having to beat a defense of 3. Pushing you direct spell up to Force 12 isn't really going to help you much unless you are somehow rolling near 20 dice for you attack. Now, imagine your are up against a Force 9 Spirit of Earth. They get 9 dice to resist your attack, which means on average 3 hits. You get 12 dice, so on average 4 hits. On average you do 1 DV per attack. On the plus side, you can cast with like Force 6, hardly ever hit the limit and never face more than 3 drain, and you can keep firing that all day. If you use Edge and a higher Force spell, maybe you can hurt it a bit, but you are otherwise doing to die, and die soon. Now, if you throw lightning, it is different. First you have to hit it, and the spirit rolls 17 defense die, so you're going to have to burn some edge to get a good shot of hitting them. If you use a Force 10 ball lightning though, you just need to get three hits, and even if you don't make it, the spirit is probably going to still feel some hurt. If you do make the test (and on average, with 12 dice you should), that spirit has 10 point of hardened armour and 13 body, but with a Force AP -10, that armour is off the table and they are resisting with just 13 dice. On average they get 4-5 hits. That means 5 or 6 damage (and remember, if you beat the test, the net hits add to that). The electricity also means spirit also loses 5 initiative and get a -1 dice pool penalty for the rest of the combat turn. You have to suck up 9 drain, which is likely going to hurt you almost as much as the spirit, but he'll get physical and you'll almost certainly take stun, so compared to your other spells, that is going to seem like a pretty good deal. Of course, if you have a Krime Cannon, and you manage to get enough wireless smartlink & take aim bonuses that you actually can hit the spirit. Admittedly that is pretty difficult, but definitely easier than with lightning bolt, as you start with 13 dice, and thanks to your high will power you can take up to 3 Take Aim actions. So you can get to 17 dice without losing essence to smart link implant, so you have a real shot at hitting the spirit. If you spend some edge, you probably don't need to waste time taking aim. The Krime gets 16P AP-6 +net hits, which is going to get resisted by 17d6 + 2 (from the 4 levels of hardened armour), for an average of... 7-8 hits. So that's 8-9 DV... and you don't take drain. It's amazing, but in some ways big guns are better than big combat spells for taking out materialized spirits! If your GM will allow it, the In Debt quality is a good way to expand a slot E resources characters options. Everything is a loss. Keep in mind your spirits can do astral projection (not the same, but helpful). You can compensate for it with some detection spells, but if you really want it, I'd say that is going to cost you for this build.   Go tweak away. I'd love to see what you come up with."
Shadowrun,3cqkfm,xcbsmith,2,Sun Jul 12 08:12:08 2015 UTC,"One other thing to keep in mind about L/M/HMG's: they are all terribly unsubtle. You can't just carry them around the street. That's why they tend to be used when mounted on vehicles, therefore Gunnery skill."

Shadowrun,3cqkfm,xcbsmith,3,Fri Jul 10 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"Screw the min/max aspect. The idea is not entirely unsound. Maybe not optimal min/max, but it can work.  On the attribute side, strength & dex are helpful, but a troll starts out already reasonable on the strength side, and you can get away with crummy dex if you are mostly going complex action semi-bursts. His setup has strength, agility, willpower, intuition, body and magic basically all maxed out, so I think he's fine on attributes, though I'd consider compromising a bit on strength & body to save karma/slot down attributes.  On the skill side, he's not really a weapon specialist. It's just his weapon of choice is a heavy cannon. He's pushing it up to 6 while a typical mage might have something a bit lower, but that's maybe a handful of skill points at best. In so doing, he frees up a need to bring up his combat spells (at least for ranged indirect, and I'd argue with his high strength, he doesn't need to worry about touch either), which should allow a for a rich spell selection.  Nah, it can work. I'd probably try to swap skills & attributes, but I know everyone prefers to build up their skills after chargen."
Shadowrun,3cqkfm,D_Keller,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"Well, the problem I have is that my troll metatype is already worked into our party backstory, so that can't easily be changed. And since we are without any magical support, I kind of have to fill the roll of magical support in some way. To make matters worse, I always thought the idea of a HMG wielding character would be really fun to play, since I usually end up playing mages anyways.  So is there any way for me to fix this build? Unfortunately, I have not played this game yet so I am not the best at knowing if something is suboptimal and will not work in game. I don't want to have a character that falls behind everyone else, and ends up being a liability.  What if I were to switch spellcasting out for summoning, and have him focus on spirits instead of spells? Would that improve him much?  On the point of not having a heavy weapon at char gen, I am not too concerned about that, as it seemed like it would be fun to rp him trying to acquire one. I just want him to be able to use it quite well when he gets it"
Shadowrun,3cqkfm,Mittensworth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:55:21 2015 UTC,"As others have said, there's no reason to try to stretch yourself to cover all the bases with your team. Magic users are about 1% of the population, plenty of runner teams get by without one at all, and your team already has an adept.  If you want to be a big troll with a big gun, do that. Your team of runners will be hired for missions that shouldn't require magic, and your adept should be able to warn you when magicy drek is about. You could take the points you spent trying to be a hybrid mage, and put them into clubs or unarmed or something that will take advantage of your prodigious strength.  Try to think about how you will contribute to each phase of a run, what can you do to help the team during the meet? How can you help gather intel during the legwork? What is your job during the mission? What do you contribute after the mission is over?"
Shadowrun,3cqkfm,Mittensworth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:08:49 2015 UTC,"How well do you think an aspected conjurer would do instead of full mage? I was thinking the same priority distribution, but D = aspected conjurer and C = skills. That would also give him more skill points to work with, so he has a wider range of abilities out of chargen, and 4 of the 5 special points would go to magic, raising it to 6.  Spirits seem like they could cover a bit of magical utility and defense, while still allowing my character to grow as a cannon troll. If I went binding heavy though, I would have to shift two attribute points from INT to CHA though, so he can bind more spirits.  What is your opinion on that? To me it seems to fit the Heavy Support role of my character, while giving us a means to handle hostile spirits/magic a little better. And it seems like spirits of man can use one chosen spell as a special, bringing a little spellcasting back."

I don't think its stretching yourself too thin, and after a few runs you'll be doing great."

Shadowrun,3cqkfm,xcbsmith,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:44:12 2015 UTC,"That is pretty close to what I was thinking. Add onto that the HMG or cannon and he could forgo combat spells for the most part. It is a cool build imo, but he starts with a heavy weapons pool of 10, spellcasting pool of 12, and drain pool of 9. I get the feeling that is not really that good, and I don't know how much I could improve it down the road.  Is there any way you think I could optimize this build better? I think these characters will be pretty long term so I want to get it right. D_Keller above did explain quite well that magic users are not a requirement on runner teams so I suppose I could go ranged adept instead."

Secondly you cannot have multiple Martial arts at chargen.   Assuming you bought that magic 5 with karma, you would be better off spending your 1 metatype special attribute point to raise magic, then 15 karma to raise edge, saving you 10 karma.  You will likely never use the multitude of weapons that you have from the firearms group.  Danger sense is almost stricktly worse than combat sense.   you should max one of your attributes. I would probably recommend agility.  You don't have the sneaking skill  Ambidextrous is a quality of mediocre usefulness. Attacking multiple times, even if its with two hands, now splits your dice pool. The second hand is also almost useless given as recoil applies to you, not the gun as well. Semi automatic weapons can be used to shoot multiple targets in the same way an ambi quality would."

Shadowrun,3cprbb,Bamce,2,Thu Jul 9 20:42:17 2015 UTC,"Each martial art style has six techniques for a character to choose (listed under Available Techniques).

It's unclear as to how that applies to specialties which are also MA, like Parkour, but it's either okay or you could rename it ""Free-running"" and have the same general abilities. Gunnery and Heavy Weapons are good, somewhat implies, with the low Pilot skill, that he often gets tasked as a machinegunner on a tactical vehicle.

Heck, just using 1 Special Attribute Point to get to magic 5 is worth 25 karma = the Y50K you'd get from money D.  ""a bunch of heavy blah blah"" - just spend as  little as possible at chargen, ONE gun, armored jacket and a ballistic face mask, arm guards and 1 PPP piece for the +4 total you can use free w/str 3  , cheapass commlinks, ONE half decent SIN, tag eraser - you don't really NEED much more than that eq-wise and can pick up the other nice stuff with cash from your first runs.  Spend your karma on Qualities and Attributes, maybe on the low level skills (like that Pilot Ground Craft 1 would only cost 2 karma, and the Skill Point you saved could go to say Heavy Weapons 5 which would otherwise cost 10 karma).  Use the 6th Power Point to go to Improved Reflexes 2.  Squeeze an attr point from somehwere and get Agility 6, it will help ALL your combat skills.  If it was me I'd probably get ONE firearms skill, almost certainly Automatics 6, and use the skillgroup 5 for Stealth - gets you sneaking and disguise and palming (v. nice to conceal gear)  You're also missing any social skills -how can you have any kind of cop without any social skill? At least spend 2 karma and get Etiquette 1, some Con would be handy too.   Agree Ambidextrous is nowhere near worth the points, SINner can be awful if your GM is not a patsy."

All you can do is shoot, and an elf face who spent 7 skill points on it will be BETTER at it than you with your 13 skill points + umpetty karma for MA + 15 skill points worth of skill groups.  You don't have baton (club) skills like a cop would have been trained in, you have no hope of questioning or intimidating suspects, you can't even ACT like a cop reliably, and you can't even make up excuses for why you can't do your job - just from covering up I'd expect a bit of Con and some Stealth to be hiding when your bosses are looking for you to ream you out :D  You have no way to contribute to legwork, you'll be doing nothing but sitting around waiting for combat as far as I can see...  Recoil:  All you need is 1 added point of RC to be able to fire 3 round bursts without penalty (on top of your 1 for strength and 1 inherent), and it's pretty easy to get to the 6 you'd need to fire Full Auto.   50Y for a shock pad or 30Y for a folding stock will get ya 1, underbarrel weight will get ya another one for Full Auto, then you need 2 more either from the weapon or from Gas Vent 2 (400Y) (but if you add a Gas Vent you can't add a silencer).  For you a good main weapon would be a Ares Alpha, comes with 2 points of RC, +your 2 (1 for str, 1 inherent) + a shock pad for Y50, and it has a grenade launcher so you can use your Heavy Weapon skills, you could add a Gas Vent 1 for 200Y to get the 6th RC point OR accept a -1 dice or fire 5 round FA bursts and mount a silencer instead of the Gas Vent.  Or more expensive, a Yamaha Raiden comes with a suppressor and 1 point built-in RC, add a Shock Pad and Gas Vent 2 and you can fire 6 round FA bursts every Initiative Pass.  You'll have to pay to add an underbarrel grenade launcher though.  A good concealable weapon would be Ares Crusader II, add a folding stock and underbarrel weight , bam 6 RC and you can add a silencer.  Same concealability as a Heavy Pistol.  Remember firing BF/FA is a simple action, and you can only attack once per Init Pass, so as long as you do something else (hint Take Aim if you have nothing better to do) your Recoil will reset every pass.  And for the ""can't afford"" below - come on, a regular club is 30Y, regular throwing knives are 25Y.  Even the stun baton is only 750Y, that's less than half a karma, you've got 50 karma to spend at chargen what did you spend it all on????  Still if you insist on just shooting, with zero social skills and zero sneaking, I guess you could spin it as being the gun obsessed SWAT guy or something, if you're fine with contributing nothing to legwork or anything outside of half-decent shooting in combat...  Oh and think about swapping out one of the .5 PP things to include Agility Boost(1), that'll add an average of 2.33 dice to your attacks, as long as you can take a simple action to activate it (not TOO hard).  Maybe Nimble Fingers for the other .25 PP..."

From what I could make out, I'd actually move Negotiation to Con and drop Intimidation, when I mentioned the social skills I didn't mean you needed to take all of them, just a couple of the crucial ones (for me I think that's Etiquette and Con), that's enough to survive at first and you can pick up any more you feel the need for after a few runs.  And an optimization tip - it looks like you used karma to buy Automatics from 4->6 but Skill Points to buy some of the 1 point skills - you save a LOT of karma if you do it the other way,  buying a 1 point skill with karma is 2 karma so it'd be 4 karma to get 2 of them, using the 2 Skill Points you saved to raise Automatics from 4->6 saves 22 karma for a net savings of 18 karma...  Edit:  Oh and buy Armored Jacket(Armor 12) not Armored Clothing(Armor 6), the price diff is WELL worth it.  Add a Ballistic Mask (150Y +2),  and either a helmet(100Y +2) or  (forearm guards(300Y +1) + Securetech PPP Arms Kit(250Y +1)) for a total of Armor 12+4=16 with no Encumbrance penalty, which is pretty damn nice - most everything that hits you will be Stun damage unless it's got a ton of AP, and you'll have 3+16(-AP) dice to soak damage.

There're three ways to get modular limbs to work.  1) Take a modular connector for an existing CYberlimb (For example, a modular wrist for your arm, letting you swap out the hand as you see fit.)  2) Take a modular connector for a 'stump', paying Essence for it, then buy a Cyberlimb (paying Essence for that as well!), but you can then remove and replace that limb whenever you want.  3) Take a Modular CYberlimb, which has the connector already built in to it, allowing you to remove a part (hand/lower arm/whole thing) and click new parts in as needed.  .  So, yeah, if you wanted four Modular limbs, you'd take a hit of 1.2 Essence for the connectors (before applying a Grade of course!), then 4 more fo rthe four limbs, for 5.2 total (ouch!) ... But you could then remove your arms and legs at will, swapping them for others as needed.  .  (But you really want to get some of that in a better Grade to keep your precious Essence!)"

Shadowrun,3co8oi,neureaucrat,8,Thu Jul 9 13:14:42 2015 UTC,"You can banish them, they have resistance to it, but it's doable, in case of Flesh Forms [I don't remember the ones who look just like humans] the host will die anyway as it surrendered it's essence to the spirit.

Shadowrun,3co8oi,Trathos,3,Fri Jul 10 19:22:26 2015 UTC,"There are three kinds of Insect Spirit inhabitation.  True Form is when the insect completely overcomes the vessel, this one is the one that looks like a gigantic bug.  Hybrid Form is when the vessel is not completely overwelmed, this one looks like a mishmash beetween what the vessel looked like and waht the bug spirit looks like, any cyberware the vessel had is fully functional and the bug can even enter the Matrix, but since no skills remains after the transformation the bug would need to learn the skills.  Flesh form is when the vessel resists transforming into a True or Hybrid form, it's a perfect amalgamation beetween bug spirit and metahuman flesh, it retains all of the vessel skills and attributes and looks indistinguishable from a normal metahuman. This is the kind of bug spirit that generally does recruitment work.  For more information go to page 196 of Street Grimoire"
Shadowrun,3co8oi,psykulor,2,Fri Jul 10 19:45:34 2015 UTC,"So a True Form bug spirit would disappear when Banished, but a Hybrid or Flesh bug spirit would be suitable vessels? If the spirit is banished from a Flesh Form vessel, you just have a normal corpse - not interesting. But if a Hybrid Form corpse could be inhabited by a friendly spirit... that's when the Cool Factor comes into play."
Shadowrun,3co8oi,Trathos,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"Flesh form and Hybrid Form would all leave only husks behind if banished, there are no rules for using such husks as vessels for another spirit, in the least you would need to prepare them for inhabitation again."

Shadowrun,3co8oi,sb_747,2,Fri Jul 10 21:35:20 2015 UTC,I would say it depends on how early you catch it. Has the spirit been recently implemented and not have much time to grow(like say under 36 hours)?  In that case I would say a successful banishing ritual could free the vessel but would assign essence loss based on time implanted and the appropriate negative qualities to make up for the mental trauma.  Once a bug spirit is fully grown however all hope for the vessel is lost.   Check out the in inhabitation power on 195/96 of street grimoire for more information on how the power works
Shadowrun,3co8oi,tahuti,3,Thu Jul 9 14:43:37 2015 UTC,"Nice. I was toying  with the idea of a character that had been possessed by a bug spirit but was saved before it could ""take"". Kind of like the finale of the Newt storyline from Aliens...  These two passages along with GM approval makes the idea seem possible.   During merging, the vessel’s original spirit is consumed (if present) and that character is lost (though gamemasters may decide otherwise, if appropriate to their stories).   And   An inhabiting spirit is only disrupted when its vessel is either destroyed or killed from Physical damage overflow.   Character gets possessed, friends find him, he attacks, gets shot, GM hand waving, he's resuscitated, the spirit's gone. He's scarred forever and super interesting to play."

There is nothing to prevent you to use incubation time. Maybe add some magical research/reagent that is hard to get, running out of time, give them an ally/spirit that knows thing or two about insect spirits, so it is not just simple banishing.  Also even if flash form is created they don't look the same. 0 success - host destroyed and true form emerges  1-2 host body acquire primary resemblance to true form (flesh form)  3 some true form characteristics like armor, multifaceted eyes (flesh form)  4 only one of physical aspects (flesh form)  5 host body retains original form and spirit has access to host memories"

What it means is only that you can't get between it on location and it in the wider world.  It's like this I think: every wireless device is set to broadcast and propagate the Matrix around it. A grid is like a subnet of the Matrix that can be connected to from any other subnet of it, with the public grid being the default subnet for new users. So even when you're in the barrens and the only thing you can get a signal to is the PAN's of people closeby those PAN's and the few wireless devices that are within reach create their own, local version of each grid that is specified to exist in the Matrix protocols.  So you are still on the grid, it's just that right now the ""server"" you use to connect to it can't reach any other such ""servers"". It's like an IRC netsplit if you're familiar with that. Only you and whatever other users happen to be in the same area can interact with each other, but for all intents and purposes there is still a grid, only you can't use it to reach users that are not in your area so it's pretty empty (unless of course you get a sattelite uplink)."

I would also rule that benefits to being wireless that don't rely on a matrix at large (ie communication between commlinks, ejection etc) would still apply"
Shadowrun,3cnmmq,felicidefangfan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:49:14 2015 UTC,Wireless benefits aren't actually lost unless the single largest source of noise exceeds the device rating (Usually 2 or 3)

For example a weapon's smartlink is supposed to factor in all sorts of atmospheric data (like air pressure and humidity) to help calculate the ideal bullet trajectory, in a place with absolutely no matrix access I don't see how it could gather that data to take it into consideration"
Shadowrun,3cnmmq,felicidefangfan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"The matrix is on a global scale now the way it's defined, and the Redmond Barrens are what you would call a static zone. Use a high noise modifier to represent the situation. If you look closely, there is little to no mention of the word barrens in 5e. I believe the concept was essentially removed and replaced with static zones. Same difference though, but the idea is that a hacker with good equipment can still make contact (cyberdeck, Signal Scrub, Vectored Filtered module) and reduce it significantly."
Shadowrun,3cnmmq,shaninator,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:24:58 2015 UTC,"As the others said, you should still have access just with more Noise. Unless they happen to be in an area where it's shielded from wireless.  However, to answer the question at large... distance based Noise is calculated from the antenna on your Deck to the antenna on their Comm. So yes, you can hack them even if you were in the middle of nowhere.  Depending on what the wireless bonuses are, you may or may not get them. On a Smartgun for example, they are trying to connect to local weather sources so they can compensate for wind speed and such. Those sources wouldn't be available, so no you wouldn't get that bonus. If you meant the wireless bonus of having your Wired Reflexes and Reaction Enhancers talking to each other, that would still work. Or for talking to a pistol and having it eject the magazine, that would work too."
Shadowrun,3cnmmq,marcus_gideon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:58:11 2015 UTC,"TL;DR You should probably just have a shit-ton of noise. Look at the noise table, it specifically lists the noise rating of barrens."

They will have a -2 penalty to all matrix actions since the Public Grid is legacy technology.  However, once they grip hop to another grid from the Public Grid, they are subjected to GOD OS.  OS would not accumulate if your Lifestyle supports grid access. Medium Lifestyle and higher allows access to modern grids, such as Emerald City (Seattle, UCAS) for medium and whatever select Corporate Grid for High Lifestyle. As a GM, I would not subject OS to hackers jumping grid from a higher to lower grid, but I would vice versa."

You're also not exposing yourself to as many astral threats (walking into a charged ward would be the big one, but there's plenty of stuff your GM could have living inside the walls that would hurt if you walked through it).  I guess Mana Barriers are a thing. If you're trying to push through a Ward you're up against its Force x2, and it's a Charisma-based test. If you're not a Charisma-based mage, that's gonna be rough. Clairvoyance just make it an opposed spellcasting vs force test, which should be easier to deal with.  It also lets you see with normal vision, rather than Astral, so you can pick out physical details rather than just assensing auras. Could be important, could be useless.

Shadowrun,3cmquk,Seraphim_kid,3,Thu Jul 9 02:51:34 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think any of the combat spells are necessary. Fun to use if you're a combat mage but guns are cheap, available to everyone and it isn't tricky to make a mage that's decent with automatics or heavy pistols. Also when you shoot guns at people they don't immediately know you're the mage and geek you first.  Mages are far more useful for their utility spells and their ability to do things no other player can. This gives you a wider toolbox for solving problems and that, more than blasting fools with lightning, is what SR is all about.  Spells I like: (doing this from memory, apologies if names are wrong)  Heal – fixes your friends in combat, pretty standard.  Improved Invisibility – can turn you, a friend or an object invisible to eyes and all optical devices. There are endless uses for this spell from sneaking past guards to sneaking in invisible guns.  Levitate/Magic Fingers – telekinesis baby. I personally prefer magic fingers since in a pinch it can do double duty as a combat spell (cast at high force to get high str and agility, pick up axe, wail on people at distance with axe) but levitate is more efficient for big things like people or cars. Again, being able to move stuff with your mind is endlessly useful.  Phantasm/Trid Phantasm – can cast an illusory version of anything you have previously seen. Again the uses and abuses for this are endless, everything from making a version of some guys boss to give him new orders to terrifying an opposing team of runners when HTRT suddenly shows up. Most people prefer Trid since it fools cameras too but I actually like basic phantasm since it works inside the targets mind meaning you can cast illusions only they can see and that can be useful too.  All of the mental manipulation spells specifically Mob Mind/Influence/Edit memory – You can make people think, what you want them to think. Again, there is no situation where that won’t come in handy. Influence is good for the jedi mind trick stuff and the all time classic, make the guard think he needs the toilet, mob mind is great for dealing with crowds and making people chasing you turn against each other and edit memory is for the really subtle stuff. With enough time and edit memory you can turn a stand-up white knight crusading progressive politician into a racist who wants to commit genocide on all trolls.  It should be said that in the fluff mages who use these kinds of spells are considered high priority threats and many people don’t trust mind mages so if you sue these make sure to discuss with your team/GM beforehand if they’re okay with it and how you intend to play them.  Convince – convince is the mental manipulation spell that nobody will ever see coming. Basically it makes the target more gullible, every hit reducing the threshold set by the GM for your bullshit story to convince the target. Combined with a decent con skill and charisma you can lie all the livelong day, people will believe you and you’ll probably get away with it.   Physical barrier – force fields, not so hot for blocking bullets sadly but good for slowing down pursuers and amazing if those pursuers are in a car (as they suddenly crash into a wall).   Improve attribute – lets you buff the team’s physical adept even further to make them absurdly good, let’s you fix issues with your own attributes or just give you an extra edge. The uses depend on what attribute you’re buffing. Improved charisma, for example, makes you into a decent face even if you don’t have many social skills whereas improved agility + gun makes up for a lack of combat spells.  Improved Reflexes – this should be bog standard on all mages, it’s the only way for you to boost your initiative without sacrificing magic and in SR you need to be able to boost your initiative or you’re deadweight in combat. Also you can boost the other people on your team who don’t have wired reflexes.  Physical mask/Fashion – instant disguise kit. Physical mask lets you change the appearance of yourself or someone else whereas fashion lets you change their clothes. Many classic runs involve pretending to be janitors/plumbers and sneaking into a place, these 2 spells make that easier. They also make it easier to hide pursuers and trick the Johnson. Oh and fashion makes any armour into form fitting armour.  Mind Probe – the best tool in your box for finding things out in the legwork phase.  Shapechange – Like physical mask, being able to turn into an animal is really useful for breaking into places unnoticed or escaping from places.  Analyse device – every hit gives you extra dice to use a device and raises the limit. Don’t know how to fly a plane? Analyse device. Now you do. Need to gun better? Analyse device. You go shoot that gun better. Picking a lock, reading a map, solving a rubik’s cube? Analyse device, analyse device, analyse device.  Combat sense- as a mage you’re probably squishy, this makes you less squishy or can be given to the Sammy or phys ad to make them absurdly deadly in cc.  Opium Den/Chaotic world/hot potato, etc – there are lots of spells that basically do the same thing, add a negative dice modifier to everyone targeted by the spell. This is strictly useful in combat but is a huge force multiplier and more effective imho than shooting or blasting with magic yourself. The specific spell you choose depends on the fluff you like best. I like Opium Den personally because my shaman is incredibly scuzzy so having the ability to give magical orgasms suits him (plus, lulz) but there are pretty strong fluff reasons not to have that particular choice."

Shadowrun,3cmquk,felicidefangfan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:54:50 2015 UTC,The biggest 2 advantages to combat spells are concealment (no way to tell you know one other than a deep mind probe or seeing you use it) and not needing to put any points in attributes or skills outside of your main ones just to function decently in combat (you'll likely have magic and spellcasting Maxed As A Mage anyway but less likely to have agility and [weapon skill] maxed without using up a lot of points that are already spread thin)
Shadowrun,3cmquk,Trathos,3,Mon Jul 13 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"Must have's are a indirect AoE Speel [Fireball, Ball Lghtning etc.] a single target lethal spell [Lightning Bolt, Manabolt] and a non-lethal spell [Stunbolt, Stunball], this is assuming you are a combat mage, Heal is great, your team will love you for having it, Improved Invisibility is great for infiltration.  Some situational stuff I think is worth it, Magic Fingers, Trid Phantasm, Hot Potato, Physical Barrier.  A Ritual that I don't see many people use but that can be really goodl is Ward."
Shadowrun,3cmquk,marwynn,3,Thu Jul 9 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"The Heal spell An invisibility spell The Levitate spell The Physical Barrier spell is basically a deployable wall, very useful  A way to sustain a spell without penalty   Foci either add dice to a Magical action or help you sustain one. They can wait till after chargen.   You will also want to be good at summoning. Rituals can wait, but the Watcher Spirit one is pretty useful. The rest require a specific purpose."
Shadowrun,3cmquk,thatisarandomtask,3,Thu Jul 9 03:13:27 2015 UTC,"For a multitool like mage I usually go with something from the following: Fireball or ball lightening Stunbolt Manabolt Improved invisibility Improved reflexes Heal Levitate Tri phantasm Physical barrier. And some sort of aoe disabling spell like fear or opium den or something. Also gotta take focus concentration.   I usually get as many spells as I can.

Shadowrun,3cmquk,WizardWolf,3,Thu Jul 9 03:56:38 2015 UTC,"Aside from what's been mentioned, don't underestimate the power of a good illusion spell.. I had an NPC effectively wipe our party with  two reckless castings of Mass Agony, luckily for them she was only trying to make an escape. Illusion spells can make for an excellent plan C or D when things really aren't going your way."
Shadowrun,3cmquk,marcus_gideon,2,Thu Jul 9 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"It kinda depends on what kind of Mage you want to be. Are you straight up pew-pew, standing side by side with the gun bunnies? If so, you'll probably want things like Physical Barrier, Lightning Bolt, Fireball, Manabolt... stuff that does damage.  If you want to be more about magical defense, letting the gun bunnies deal with real world threats, then you could use things like Mana Barrier, Manabolt / Manaball (the only damaging spells you can use in the Astral are Mana based).  As for Foci... they're basically like a Magic Wand. Some of them are attuned to certain schools of magic, so using it may give you extra dice when casting Combat spells, or Illusion spells. Some of them just give you bonus dice to any spell, but these are more expensive. Some give you a bonus to your Magic rating in general, which are really expensive. You can only have so many of them, and they require spending Karma to magically attune them to you before they can be used. So even if you knocked over Olivander's shop, you need a lot of excess Karma to make use of any of them."
Shadowrun,3cmquk,marcus_gideon,2,Thu Jul 9 03:12:53 2015 UTC,I'm Planning on being Utilitarian Book worm
Shadowrun,3cmquk,cormicshad,2,Thu Jul 9 03:37:58 2015 UTC,"If you want Utility spells... I think Marwynn has a good list started.  Heal spell for patching up friends. Caution, this spell works weird. You have to sustain the effect for a period of time before the healing becomes permanent. If you stop sustaining early, the damage comes back.  Invisibility is good, specifically Improved Invisibility. One just affects minds, so it doesn't work on drones, cameras, motion sensors, etc. But Improved does work on those things, so it's pretty much better in every way. Trade-off is that it's more Draining.  Physical Barrier is pretty awesome all the way around. You can make a wall, a sphere, I've seen people make a ramp to jump their car, one guy surfed on his kinda like Ice Man.  Trid Phantasm is another ""affects people and machines"", but it creates an illusion within an area. So you could make it look like a whole group of people just burst in the door with guns blazing, when really you snuck around the back.  There's a bunch more worth having, but that should get you started.  As some others said, Sustaining Foci are pretty good to have. They can only support 1 spell at a time, with a spell Force up to the Foci's rating. So if you cast a Force 6 illusion, you can't sustain it with a Rating 2 Foci. But you could sustain a Force 2 spell with a Rating 6 no problem (still only 1 spell though even if there's Rating left over). Another common trick is the Focused Concentration quality. Does the same thing, just for you personally. 1 spell up to the Rating, free of charge."
Shadowrun,3cmquk,marcus_gideon,3,Thu Jul 9 03:51:10 2015 UTC,Another trick with that Force 2 Sustaining Focus is when you are using a spell that works of the number of hits you roll instead of the force of your spell.  So a Force 1 Health Sustaining Focus can hold a Force 1 Improved Reflexes spell that you have expanded the limit on via Edge or Reagents to get the extra initiative dice.
Shadowrun,3cmquk,Hibiki54,3,Thu Jul 9 04:12:55 2015 UTC,"That gets kinda iffy... While technically true, I personally don't agree with it.  If you have to rely on Edge (Use the Force Luke) or Reagents (magic batteries) to get the spell going from the start, then you are going to need Edge or Reagents to keep it going at that cheap level. Or else you need to accommodate for the real level appropriately.  Basically, if you plan on sustaining it for any real length of time, you either need to handle the proper Drain, or you need to spend juice more often to keep it going."

For one thing, if I have the whole campaign basically planned out, then even if the team deviates from what I had laid out, I know what was supposed to be happening so I can go with the flow easier. Either they happen upon some other event that was going on, or they miss out on the event they were supposed to participate in, and other things happen b/c of it.  You can always toss in some one-off things here and there. Either they'll read into them and think it's part of the larger plot, or you can eventually work them back into the plot if they decide to forget all about it.

Shadowrun,3cm758,SmellyTofu,5,Thu Jul 9 03:59:26 2015 UTC,"Well, there's always plagiarism =)  You could borrow the storyline from a movie or something. Like having one of the team (likely the Decker since he's probably got a Datajack) hired to carry some very important data to a city around the world. Since it's very important the data not get lost, it needs to be uploaded to the storage space inside their Datajack. Then the team needs to escort the data to the dropoff. Along the way, they run into Yakuza bent on bringing in a head full of data to extract. Maybe a crazy cyber-addict street preacher. And just for giggles, a top secret hacker dolphin at the end.  Or you could borrow from popular video games? The team gets hired to ride a train to a new city, where they're working on building a series of reactors. Come to find out, these are actually Awakened reactors, leeching magical energies out of the planet itself. As the team gets deeper involved in the plot, they find out about a rising Corp trying to create their own Adepts by artificially infusing them with magical energies. One of their test subjects goes kinda crazy, and starts trying to destroy the Corp, along with anyone who gets in his way. Even poor innocent flower girls...  Really, all you need is a storyline. Then once you know what's supposed to be happening in the big picture, the small missions could be helping make things happen, could be trying to stop things from happening. Maybe the team gets hired by Pro-story people one time, and Anti-story people the next. They need to put together who is working for what, and decide whether they want the story to happen, or to work towards stopping it.  Lots of fun I tell ya!"
Shadowrun,3cm758,marcus_gideon,2,Thu Jul 9 04:17:26 2015 UTC,"There is no ""best way,"" whatever works for the GM and players is best.  I've got my game sorta organized as both. I've got vignette runs for the most part, but they all tie into an arc. That arc leads to another, four arcs fills out the campaign. Missions are set up to be flexible, if I spend days planning a cool environment for a run, it's not going in the wastebin just because the players went left instead of right, I just reskin the plan. Side missions fill in the space in between and can be related or not, and in most cases the players will be trying to figure that out."

Do a patch of Tir runs here, let the gang go home for a while, do a string of European runs there. It's created arcs that overlap, as well as unconnected TV style run-of-the-week stories peppered here and there for pallet cleansers.

Shadowrun,3cm758,shaninator,2,Thu Jul 9 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"I have an overarching set of conspiracies in the works behind the scenes. This group wants X, this group wants Y, etc. These groups will hire the runners to execute stages of that plan, or peripheral groups will hire the runners to do something which happens to put them at odds with one of the plans. However the team reacts, things continue to unfold behind the scenes, with more or less focus depending on how interested the players seem to be.  As they go, the players will develop plot hooks for their own characters, or may have already littered their background with plot hooks, and I use those to shake things up and make them really feel like this is their story (which it is, if I'm doing my job right).  I've never been interested in the old status quo is god way of thinking where you go on random disconnected runs that never have lasting impact. I want characters to show up three months down the line and have my players say ""This asshole?"" or have some mcguffin they picked up end up being important down the line and have everyone slap their foreheads for just handing it over to whoever. If they don't connect the dots, I just smile and nod as it wooshes over their heads, but if they do figure it out, I play it up. Trading off the GM hat and being able to be on both sides of the table has its benefits and drawbacks, but overall I'd say our table is working out really well.  So all in all, I'd say string your one-shot missions together into a campaign. Don't write a linear story and railroad it down your players' throats. Just expand on what your players find interesting and minimize what they don't care about. Have lasting consequences and recurring characters, bring their personal journey to the forefront.   TL;DR: Write up a background, then inject your players into it. Let your players guide the story and just have your world react accordingly."

You could have 1 johnson reuse the team multiple times, or several johnsons hire the team for conflicting reasons.   For example they get hired to steal the macguffin for X, then X hires them to steal a supporting macguffin or kill someone to cover it up. X might then hire them for a third time and send them on a suicide mission to cover his tracks. Y then hires the team to resteal the macguffin (or sabotage it, either with them going in knowing its the same item or kept secret as a surprise). X discovers the team has retaken his macguffin and orders a hit on them, team then has a mission to clear their name/survive/clear the bounty. Z notices the team could be handy in his grudge with X and hires them to destroy the macguffin (which X has reclaimed from Y without using the players). Z then hires the team for an assassination of X, requiring a mission to ID him properly, and then a mission to find and kill him (thus ending the campaign on a big note).   Inter-spaced in that, you have some one shots based on the setting (maybe some gang warfare in the barrens, maybe something related to politics in the settings city, maybe a terrorist group is involved relating to a major landmark in the area), some one shots based on the character backstories (make them feel like a part of the world), and a side mission series based on some faction the players end up allying with or opposing or both (perhaps the mafia are looking to expand so there's a short series of 3 missions relating to that.   The Don hires players to do something to expand once, side mission 2 has them do another job for him to expand again, side mission 3 has him either want to expand, or lonestar blackmailing the team into working as undercover agents to bust the Don based on this recent expansion)"

Build hooks into the missions as well. From groups wanting revenge against the players, to dealing with the consequences of the players actions.

As a Magician, the most important thing you're gonna be doing is managing your Drain. Don't skimp on your WIL and other Drain stat (CHA, LOG), which as an Ork is gonna be tough (you've chosen arguably the worst Metatype for a Magician)... And accordingly, be very mindful of your Spells Drain Values especially as they compare to the ultimate result of the Spell vs. similar Spells... Buy a Rating 2 Power Focus. Also, buy a Rating 3 Sustaining Focus (Health). Not even getting as many Spells as possible are as important as these two things. Summoning; take at least 1 rank. Spirits are too useful not to. Also, an Overcast Stunbolt is usually just as effective as Banishing - don't take Banishing. ALSO, Ritual Spellcasting is very niche (especially if there are no other Magicians in your group), don't take it. Must have Spells, IMO, for a combat mage; Increase Reflexes - Initiative (going early and often) is KING in SR (which accordingly means don't neglect your REA and INT either), Mass Agony - amazing de-buffing (especially if you have a Spirit to Sustain it for you...) with minimal Drain, Heal - simply a must, Stunbolt - you should always be able to manage the Drain from this spell, Control Thoughts - not only are you negating one targets actions, you can use them to deal damage  - which is essentially a debuff in SR - to a second. Seeing enemies and not being SEEN by enemies is very important for a Magician - don't neglect Perception and Infiltration Skills! A well Connected Talismonger Contact is pretty clutch so you can buy a Rating 4 Power Focus as soon as is possible.

I've seen some Task Spirits before and often they take a shape that's practical. These ones are not only humanoid but very anthropomorphic.  Classical Tradition - Magic in Greece never quite took off the same way as it did in other places. No one liked the idea of praying to Zeus or, ahem, Ares for help. Still, Mentor Spirits claiming to be those ancient Greek deities have shown up to the Awakened Greek, worldwide. The Classicists don't like them. At all. There's the Greek Priesthood, small in number and not really growing, but the Classicists are making sure they stay that way. These guys are historians, or history buffs at least, and they're probably responsible for the higher than average number of Free Spirits (that may or may not be inspired by sculptures or frescoes or whatever). Not big fans of shadowrunners either, but they'll hire you to make sure the presbyters stay down.  Asclepions - I'm told that back in ancient times these were places of wonder and healing.

They're angry, they hate everything, and they've carved out their territory amid some ruins (the more recent kind). They like to wear red. Do. Not. Call. Them. Red Bulls. You've been warned."
Shadowrun,3ckjim,marwynn,6,Wed Jul 8 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"Satyrs - I hate to sound racist but don't ever trust a satyr. Nearly all of these guys are Awakened and nearly all of them follow Bacchus. You go look up who that is. Weird thing is that ""Bacchus"" is the Roman name for Dionysus, the original Greek god for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Why a bunch of Greek Satyrs are worshipping a Roman-inspired totem is beyond me. The Greek Priesthood has ties to Dionysus who may or may not also be Bacchus. If this is getting too metaphilosophical for you then I'm right there with you. But the Satyrs seem to have focused on the darker aspects of Bacchus. Dionysus is apparently more of a social party guy.  Sites of Power - The reason I know so much is that during my late night walks I stumbled upon a revel. Not a party, a shindig, or a soiree. An old fashioned revel. Greece is practically littered with ancient ruins and almost all of these have become or always were sites of power. Mana flows oddly here, but powerfully. It's worth getting acquainted with several sites, otherwise you may cheese off some of the Free Spirits. Anyway, the revel: not all of the participants were willing, conscious, or perhaps even living. I have seen some drek in my time, chummers. This is one of the darkest I've ever seen. Apparently good food and drinks though. Just don't ask what was being served. Toxics - While I was running for my life and sanity I ran into a cove just outside the city limits. Athens, and really all of Greece, is unfortunately heavily polluted. Perhaps not much more than any other modern metropolis, but it still sucks. That means Toxic magicians, and boy are there plenty. But you never really encounter them. Back about 20 years ago there was a major Hive that was rooted out. It was just shoved further underground, right where the Toxics were. They've been engaged in their own shadow war since then, mostly keeping the fight to themselves. This cove I ran into was perhaps a Toxic stronghold. It glowed like one and I was about to hightail it outta there when I literally stumbled upon two corpses. You can guess of what.  Religion - Just stay away from this. The Orthodox and Catholic Church have come to some sort of agreement and are stamping out the paganism of the Greek Priests and their ilk. Each side offers plenty of pay but they come with way too many strings. Of course, the Muslims have joined in as well, though they're on their own side instead of joining up and fighting the pagans.   Now to more mundane matters.   Art and Artifacts - Okay I lied. But this doesn't strictly require being Awakened. The magical relics/artifact craze of yesteryear is still going pretty strong in the FRH. Not everything has to be magical of course, but the most common jobs for the subtle types are the recovery, destruction, replacement or even re-arrangement of artifacts. This means private homes, mansions, arcologies, and so on so the security levels are all over the place. My second last job involved me walking in someone's home, which was unlocked, and nudging a vase three inches (who uses inches?) to the left and rotating it so that a particular image was facing the window. Don't know if it's feng shui or just a really odd prank. You'll still get called into universities and lower-end corp research sites to grab some stuff. Or insert some false data. Very lucrative business here. Make some contacts in the University of Athens and the Hellas College of Thaumaturgy if you want to make your lives easier. Body Sculpting - Popular with both with chrome or wetware, the Hellans (and some call themselves that) have managed a strange mix between natural and ideal. Marbled limbs or perfectly muscled forms are the norm here for the well-to-do. Extractions are common as well since these are nearly all individualized works of art. For most of these runs the Johnson and the Mark are usually one and the same. Struggling artists sign contracts and no-compete clauses to work for a master and his workshop. When they learn enough or they get sick of their bosses hogging the credit they strike out on their own. Many are actually well-educated, students of biology and anatomy with medical degrees. Worth keeping on your good side. Getting Around - Public transportation sucks. But all other alternatives are worse. Buy multiple passes, each one tied to a different SIN, and take the trains. Avoid any and all ""express"" trains. Not because they're horrible, but because they all have so many sensors and cameras that any Fake SINs will be easily caught. The advertising on those is relentless, so many upstanding normal citizens avoid them as well. If you buy a mapsoft that only shows you the streets you got ripped off. Cities build up and there are layers to old ancient Athens that don't show up in the tourist softs. Food - It's usually fish. If you don't like seafood you should avoid the entire region omae. Sure, it's not caught from the sea anymore, but it's still a big thing. This is where you can do some sorta legitimate work. There are aqua farms near Athens as well as dozens of so-called water purification plants. Most of these are covers or tax loopholes. The FRH can't afford to inspect each and every one of them--the truth is they can but their inspectors have inconvenient attachments to their lives or their loved ones which the corporations are all too willing to eliminate. Recently, they've just been bribing them so the inspectors nearly all work for the corps they're inspecting. That's where you come in. No, you don't blow up the damn fish and krill farms. You familiarize yourself with the environmental codes, or get a knowsoft, and you secretly gather information. Maybe record some frank discussions between employees, or secure some mail from management. This goes beyond the food industry, but it's the biggest concern. They pay well and may get you a contact inside the government for other work."

Shadowrun,3ckjim,pfm1995,5,Thu Jul 9 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"Minotaur's Maze - The Cyclops and Minotaur troll meta-varients are more common around Greece. They are generally feared by a population that has grown up with legends and stories about evil cyclops and minotaurs causing a ruckess and providing obstacles to ancient heroes. The fear is also exacerbated by the fact that the nation's most popular TV Show Minotaur's Maze has a team of ""gladiators"" run through a gauntlet, similar to American Gladiators. The prize for the winning participants is a paid, do nothing, position with the sponsoring Corp of the week. Just so happens that they're taking auditions, and the Corp is the one that your team just took a job for... Big Money, Big Prizes, I Love it! What does the Hellenes Urn? - Greece legends are a fascination for many Western people. The Roman Empire enjoyed them so much they stole their gods, their stories, and overwrote their names. The British and Persians loved their monuments and artifacts so much that they took them to put in their own museums. So much of Greek culture has been exported and filled other museums that the Greeks have, for decades, fought legal battles in order to reclaim their artifacts. One example is the Hellenes Urn, it is currently a loan exhibit in the Athens Museum of Ancient History. In one week the Urn will be boxed up and transported back to England where it will likely sit for the rest of its existence. This shameful state of affairs is intolerable for any good citizen of Greece and your Johnson let's you know how he feels about it. Retrieve the Urn, with no alarms, and in a decade it can be ""rediscovered"" for the Greek people. The ensuing legal battles will drag on for eternity... but it's about time that the British were on the receiving end of it. They say of the Acropolis where the Parthenon is... - There are no straight lines. Of course that's silly, there are plenty of straight lines. Now, Centuries after the Ottomans and Venetians caused massive damage to the temple, reconstruction on the ruins has returned it to its original state (minus the marble statues that still reside in a British museum). Once more Athena sits in her temple... too bad no one can visit her. The Orthodox and the Catholic churches are particularly against the rise of the pan-Hellenistic revival and they've been able to write up legislation to prevent people from ""desecrating ancient sites of historical significance"" by banning any ceremonies at those sites. The bill is to be voted on this month, the council members may need a bit of convincing one way or another... perhaps you have a few ideas?"

Shadowrun,3cllm7,PinkTrench,2,Wed Jul 8 21:29:16 2015 UTC,"I tend not to play it that way. AR personas are notably slow and jerky to VR users, and I'd say the reverse is true, too - VR personas jump around and skip animations for AR users.

It will be in the rough direction of the decker, faded relative to the distance between the viewer and the icon.   is the Matrix too separate?   No, but the base tech used to pin the matrix to the physical world is fairly inaccurate.   [can everybody with an image link] see a holographic knight(or whatever) step out of his body and swing a battleaxe (or whatever) through the drone, which falls out of the sky on fire[?]   They will be able to use Matrix Perception to tell the last action taken by the decker's persona, at the moment of taking said action. This will give them an understanding of what the decker has done, and may be visually represented through a combat animation, but it won't be happening in real time."
Shadowrun,3cllm7,BitRunr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:37:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, the rules are rather muddled when it comes to Matrix location vs Physical location. Technically, you should have to use Trace Icon to find your lost keychain, even if the keyfob has a visible broadcasting Icon in AR.  However, as I mentioned in my post, I think it's pretty easy to get away with a system akin to Astral Perception. If all the digital action is happening within immediate line of sight (and 100 meters as per Matrix Perception) then the teammates should be able to view it. If nothing else, it gives some cinematic action to what would otherwise be pretty boring for the Meatsuits to wait while the hacker ""does his thing"".  One way to justify your teammates being able to see, without giving away the tactical nature of making checks on your opponents, would be to say that the hacker creates some kind of network with the team's AR stuff. Like how a lot of teams resort to using Send Message to silently talk bad about the Johnson during the meet. Or messaging back and forth instead of using hand signals. So you could say that friendly AROs are visible, but enemy AROs need to be properly detected first."
Shadowrun,3cllm7,marcus_gideon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:47:22 2015 UTC,"I don't find it muddled per se - each particular rule or example is clear.

But I think it could be doable for the team to see what you're doing. If you're getting really into the Iconography and themes of the digital duel, why not let them see the hacker in action. It gives them a completely different point of view, so maybe they won't think he's just ""that guy who sleeps a lot and opens doors"" if they can see your Persona firing Data Spikes into the drone hovering overhead. Just seems to me it would be more entertaining and cinematic. Though admittedly it hasn't come up in any games so far, I could see potential."

Shadowrun,3cllm7,marcus_gideon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"I would handle it the same way as an Astral Mage.  If they are doing things right there in the immediate vicinity, then you can see them through AR. Although if they are Running Silent (Matrix equivalent of Invisibility only everybody can do it), then you'd need to make a Matrix Perception check to see through it.  If they decide to start hacking into something around the world, you'd see the Persona whisk off at the speed of light (literally). Or if they remotely entered into a Host, you'd see the Host Icon appear, and then they'd both disappear.  Now for some people, they would decorate their Persona as a means of public expression. When they're walking down the street wearing their boring leather jacket... if you look at them with AR you'd see bright glowing Tron tracer lights running across their body. Or they'd actually look like a Witch Doctor with the colored headdress and a chittering monkey perched on their shoulder.  There was a short story someplace, about a nightclub full of people. Well, about 3/4s full of people, the other 1/4 were digital constructs of people who were VR. And everybody was running their own themes. One person looked like a demon with huge bat wings, and they left smoking footprints on the floor as they walked. Another looked like an Angel or something, sitting in a booth in the corner. And the booth had clouds and stone pillars going on. Of course, if you didn't have AR going, all you saw was a bunch of random people wandering around an empty warehouse with plastic chairs and tables."

Shadowrun,3clb8s,Trathos,2,Wed Jul 8 22:46:19 2015 UTC,"Having a character that runs only with another set character will limit your play options, even more if those characters share the same skillset.  Martial arts are very situational and unless you have crazy high initiative most of the time you will not have the chance to close in for a disarm, using a gun with non-lethal  ammo is a more recommended approach.  Dedicated mundane faces tend to suffer because not only social adepts are stronger but also a lot of characters with above average charisma tend to take social skills [specially shamans] to serve as a backup faces."
Shadowrun,3clb8s,Allarionn,2,Wed Jul 8 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Non-lethal ammo sounds fun! I wanted to stay as a mundane character as it seems for Face characters the bioware aspect (primarily tailored pheromones) seem quite powerful, and I'd like to have a few cyberware implants as well. I was thinking of creating a ""Quintessential British Gentleman"" trope inspired character. What about specializing in small firearms (SMG's and Pistols) and having the Face portion still a big part of the character, would that be more viable or if I want to do the Face aspect should I really look at a magical character?"
Shadowrun,3clb8s,Allarionn,3,Wed Jul 8 21:37:07 2015 UTC,"A mundane face is viable but you will need a secondary role.  As a ""Quintessential British Gentleman"" you can go the James Bond route, get your social skills and stuff then go for some infiltration, B&E and some combat.  You are not going to be as fast or shoot as precisely as a Street Sam but in a pickle you might provide enough firepower to finish off the oposition"
Shadowrun,3clb8s,Mittensworth,2,Wed Jul 8 22:54:44 2015 UTC,"It is actually perfectly viable to be a Mundane Face and gunslinger, leaving only you playstyle to really determine the differences. There are a number of good examples of this /r/RunneHub (as well as on Shadownet, I'm sure).  I personally have one of my characters who is specifically this concept, with both strong socials and quite good pistols skills. In spite of what Trathos has said, there are only a few social adepts on the Hub at least that are noticeably stronger in social skills, and most are much less combat oriented in general.  The ""Quintessential British Gentleman"" trop inspired character (as you put it) is both viable and can shoot as precise as a street same while only being slightly slower than them, dodge well, speak very well, and tank better than your average character can.  A mundane face can also still go full social and be a social infiltrator and still be effective, having a secondary role is almost always needed as a fall-back for most characters, so that is no different than any other role really. You do not need to look into magic to be a competitive Face, but you will ""top out"" sooner in the role and generally become a very strong secondary, though this won't happen for dozens of runs."
Shadowrun,3clb8s,Mittensworth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:45:51 2015 UTC,I haven't looked into /r/RunnerHub much but I presume it's the same concept as /r/ShadowNET. I appreciate the advice.

Thank you kindly!  edit: Would you suggest pistols or SMG's?
Shadowrun,3clb8s,Dolanar,3,Thu Jul 9 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"For a Face specifically I would recommend Pistols. They are more concealable than Machine Pistols, and meets tend to be higher security. Also because Tasers are fully legal in the 6th world, and you can usually carry them everywhere, they use pistols.  In spite of what is said before you also have good options for more firepower, namely the Savaletta Guardian (Burst First in a heavy Pistol), Fichetti Executive Action (Light Pistol Burst Fire). With a good pool they will be quite effective and in the case of the tasers and light pistols more concealable."
Shadowrun,3cjgeh,Shakyor,2,Wed Jul 8 11:36:05 2015 UTC,"If you use Control Device, you will have to use Gunnery because you control the drones directly (Imagine you sitting there with a remote control).  If you just tell the drones to shoot people (per send message action), the drones will use their autosoft.  To jumping in: Drones are called ""dogbrains"" for a reason. So you want to ""be"" the drone yourself to do the best possible and let the other drone shoot people per send mesaage action.

If you are the owner of all devices being commanded and they are all being commanded to do exactly the same thing, taking this action costs nothing extra. Otherwise, you must split your dice pool into a number of groups equal to the number of devices you want to control with a single action."" SR5, page 238  So if you wanted to shoot some guy with all your 5 drones it would work. otherwise if you wanted to shoot different guys, you would have to split your gunnery dice pool according to the numbers of targets.  The advantage of gunnery is that you can use it with all kinds of weapons as long as they are mounted on a drone/ vehicle. Autosofts are weapon specific. Therefore is having an autosoft running for a drone army all equipped with Ares Alphas maybe better than using gunnery.  On the other hand could have 2 Assault Rifle drones and 1 sniper drone for backup and could control them both without carrying about the weapon mounted on the drone.  You see, autosoft vs. gunnery is more about what you want to do with your drones."

And also can the drones get teamwork from a machinespirit running diagnostic up to the autosoft? And regarding this point, can i just let ONE run on the rcc all the drones are hooked to?

Shadowrun,3cjgeh,gimlettio,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:10:10 2015 UTC,"This is kind of a blurry area in the rules though, because it intersects with at least the ""multiple attacks"" limitation and what is ""exactly the same action"", so don't count on your GM letting you do this.  It's kind of unbalancing to let somebody use their whole massive dice pool 5+ times in under a second on independent actions like aiming and shooting different guns from different moving platforms at different locations at a moving target even if it is the same target.  I would argue it's not ""exactly the same thing"".  Plus I think the rules try really hard to limit using those big dice pools in multiple attacks in the same IP, so I think most GMs would look askance at allowing this as being against the spirit of that rule.  ""But 5 drones could make 5 attacks in the same IP if I just gave them orders"" - yeah but using their 9 dice, not your 20+ and that's brutal enough..."
Shadowrun,3cjgeh,marcus_gideon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"The advantage of gunnery is that on almost all current drones the Pilot rating is 3 so they can get around 9 dice max, whereas you can instead use your Logic Attribute (a) (that one would hope is a lot higher than 3 for a Technomancer), specialize, add the 2 dice for being in VR, and have the option to use Edge on vital rolls.  So potentially around 16 dice just from that, from spending 6-7 scarce skill points on something that's outside your core role and needs additional equipment.   Could be cool and lifesaving, could lead to a lot of expense replacing drones :D  (a) - another issue with the rules, in different places they say to use Agility+Gunnery or Logic+Gunnery.  MOST tables rule that it's Agility+Gunnery when manually operating a gun with your meat body, Logic+Gunnery when remote controlling/Commanding, and probably Logic+Gunnery when jumped-in, although there's a case for Agility here because jumped in Pilot still uses physical stat Reaction (but jumped-in sneaking substitutes Intuition for Agility)  TL/DR: GM's gonna have to make a call here."

While the Owner may use that Comm to manifest their Persona when they choose to go online, that doesn't mean the Comm will ALWAYS have the Owner's Persona. If they aren't online, then the only Icon out there is the Comm's basic device Icon.  If you get Marks on a Slave in a PAN (the gun), they will echo up to the Master (the Comm) as well. That's b/c you had to defeat the Master's defenses in order to get at the Slave device. However, if you place Marks on the Master, it DOES NOT echo down to all the Slave devices. So when you Mark the Comm, it doesn't give you anything on the gun specifically.  Now if the Owner is online at the time, manifesting their Persona, then it doesn't matter what device they were using (Comm, Deck, RCC, terminal)... you are no longer concerned with Marking the Master of the PAN, you're trying to get Marks on the Owner's Persona directly. So for any of this to work, you need to manage some Marks against the Owner's Persona specifically.  2) When you're tracking OS, it doesn't matter what device you're using. The OS is tied to your own Persona. And your Persona only sheds OS when you Reboot. If you Spoof: Invite Marks and leave the invitation open long enough for you to Reboot, get back online, and re-acquire those Marks, then you don't need a 2nd device to do so. Just Reboot the Deck you were using. The OS will disappear when your Persona goes offline, and will be clear when you get back on again (presumably you're spoofing your login credentials so GOD doesn't realize it's the same person logging right back in)."

Shadowrun,3cj2df,shaninator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:05:46 2015 UTC,"There are risks to slaving devices. Because of the tight connections between the devices, if you get a mark on a slave you also get a mark on the master. This happens even if the slave was marked through a direct connection, so be careful about who you give your slaved devices to. This doesn’t work both ways; if you fail a Sleaze action against a slaved device, only the device’s owner gets the mark on you, not the master too. (SR5, pg. 233)"
Shadowrun,3cj2df,Downtym,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"While it does say ""Marks on a Slave also Mark the Master"", there isn't anywhere that expressly says ""Marks on the Master don't Mark the Slaves"". However, logically you wouldn't want Marks to cascade down. Well, hackers would but security admins wouldn't.  Say you have a building with Maglocks on the front door, street side door, alley side door, back door fire escape, loading bay door... then the various cameras, fire alarms, motion sensors... not to mention all the desktop terminals in the offices.  If you direct connect to the back door Maglock and Mark it, you get a Mark on the Master for the building. If they cascaded down afterwards, you'd now have a Mark on every door, camera, sensor, and terminal in the building... all from a single hack on the fire escape.  While there is some risk to the Master / Slave relationship, it's not supposed to be THAT risky.  As for Specializing... you'd be taking a specialty in the Hacking skill, not the Hack on the Fly Matrix action specifically. If you had a specialty in Personas, then it would mean you get an extra +2 dice any time you rolled Hacking against a Persona. That would mean trying to place a Mark on the Persona itself, on the Owner. Marks on the gun don't count, since that is just a device, not a Persona.  If you're hoping to land a Mark on the gun, and have it echo up to the Master, which would be the device hosting the Persona at the time... that would indirectly give you a Mark on the Persona. However, since you weren't directly targeting the Persona, you don't get the bonus dice. And if you were directly targeting the Persona (to get the bonus) then it wouldn't have any effect on the gun itself (no Marks on the gun)."

At this point, Deck B has a mark on you.  But that's it.  It doesn't have any of the marks you've accrued elsewhere.  Then you reboot Deck A and all of the marks are lost..."
Shadowrun,3cj2df,cyronius,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:33:58 2015 UTC,Not sure I explained correctly:  Deck A gets a lot of marks. Deck A uses those marks to invite Deck B to get marks on the device it has marks on. Deck B and Deck A now both have marks on device X.  Deck A reboots to lose OS.

I think it could possibly work if you had a deck or commlink outside of your PAN running an agent with orders to accept invitations to add marks. Or a second decker. Note that spoof command doesn't work on hosts though, only devices and agents.

When you Reboot, it clears both completely. Then when you come back online (with the same Deck, no need for a 2nd) you have fresh Marks and fresh OS."
Shadowrun,3cj2df,Downtym,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:28:30 2015 UTC,"If, as a decker, I hack the owner of a device (say the Commlink a smartgun is slaved to), I will be able to get some mark(s) on the owner as well as the device.   You don't mark ""the owner"". You can mark a ""target"" which is either an ""icon"" or a ""grid"". If you mark an icon your persona places a mark on the icon. If you mark a grid you can grid hop.  An icon is a host, persona, device, or file.  So, you can mark the commlink and use Spoof Command to impersonate the commlink's owner for the purpose of Matrix Actions.   If I have a spare commlink or deck, which has no OS at the moment, can I use my current high OS deck to spoof command: invite marks on the owner to invite my spare deck? If I do this and reboot my main deck, can I then use the marks my spare deck now has to spoof command: invite marks to my main deck (which has a new, low OS now.) again?   No. OS and marks are attached to your persona not your device.[0] When your persona is active on the Matrix it subsumes the device icon for the device the persona is running on and becomes you.[1] So that means your persona is gathering OS no matter what devices are in the chain. If you have a completely separate person help you - someone with a separate persona - then your idea would work.  The way it works is:  You (your persona) gets a mark on the commlink using Hack on the Fly or Brute Force which acquires OS and starts your OS timer. Then you use Spoof Command to imitate the owner of the commlink and order the commlink to Invite Mark and offer the mark(s) to your Spare Deck which increases your OS. When you reboot your main deck your persona, if it was running on your main deck, is rebooted[2]. Additionally, when your Spare Deck accepts the marks[3] it is the Spare Deck - as a separate entity - which would mark the commlink. Since you can't share marks[4] those marks are not usable by your persona.  So the chain of actions would be:  Persona comes online on the Matrix and consumes the Main Deck icon. Persona(On Main Deck): Hack on the Fly target icon. Begin accruing OS on Main Deck. Persona(On Main Deck): Invite Mark to Spare Deck. Accrue OS. Persona(On Main Deck): Since you are the owner of the Spare Deck you try to Spend a Free Action to acquire marks. However because your Spare Deck is not a persona it fails. Persona(On Main Deck): Reboot Device. Your persona drops off the Matrix.[2] This clears all Marks your Persona has placed and resets your OS. Persona comes online on the Matrix and consumes the Spare Deck icon. Persona(On Spare Deck): You have no Marks on any icons and no OS.  If you had a second, friendly Persona (let's call you Persona A and them Persona B) then you can do what you're talking about. You Hack on the Fly the commlink, then Spoof Command it to Invite Mark to Persona B, Persona B accepts the mark(s), Persona A reboots, Persona B executes Spoof Command on the commlink to Invite Mark to Persona A, Persona accepts the mark(s), Persona B reboots. Persona A has marks on the commlink and no OS. Persona B has no marks and no OS.[5]  [0] Marks: Only personas may mark icons. ...  Your marks are specific and connected to your persona and whatever you’ve marked, so you can’t just give them out for others to place or transfer them to other people. You can give other personas permission to mark devices you own with the Invite Mark action (p. 240). (SR5, pg. 236)  Overwatch Score (OS): When you perform an Attack or Sleaze action, your OS increases by the number of hits the target gets on its defense test. ... Then they force your persona to reboot, erasing all of your marks and dumping you from the Matrix (causing dumpshock if you were in VR at the time). (SR5, pg. 232) and    When you reboot the device your persona is on, your OS is reset to zero... (SR5, pg. 242)  [1] When a person uses a device to connect to the Matrix, the device’s icon is subsumed by the persona’s icon, so it’s basically gone from the Matrix until the persona jacks out. You can only run one persona at a time; switching requires you to reboot both the device you’re currently on and the device to which you want to shift your persona. (SR5, pg. 235)  [2] When you reboot the device your persona is on, your OS is reset to zero and all of your marks, as well as the ones others may have put on your icon, are erased. (SR5, pg. 242)  [3] Yes, there is a subtle contradiction in the rules between: Only personas may mark icons. (SR5, pg. 236) and Marks only last a single Matrix session and are deleted when you reboot. This is rarely an issue for most devices because they almost never need to reboot, and when they do the hosts and other services usually have a standing offer, so re-marking them takes seconds. (SR5, pg. 236)  But if you start with the axiom that [o]nly personas may mark icons then the second clause really means ""Marks only last a single Matrix session and are deleted when [the device on which your persona is running reboots]. This is rarely an issue for most [personas running on devices] because they almost never need to reboot, and when they do the hosts and other services usually have a standing offer, so [using your persona to re-mark] them takes seconds."" The second clause is just badly worded.  [4] Your marks are specific and connected to your persona and whatever you’ve marked, so you can’t just give them out for others to place or transfer them to other people. (SR5, pg. 236)  [5] Can an individual have two Personas at once? Maybe? Depends on how you read:  You can only run one persona at a time; switching requires you to reboot both the device you’re currently on and the device to which you want to shift your persona. (SR5, pg. 235)  This can be read as either:  You can only run one persona at a time; no matter how many devices you are using simultaneously.  or  You can only run one persona per device at a time;  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

Shadowrun,3cj2df,shaninator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, it should work according to the rules, but it has its own limitations.  You have marks on your target for a bit of time before you will be able to use them, which means they could detect your hack before you are actually hacking.  You have to make quite a number of Spoof Command actions with this, which is a Sleaze Action, so if you fail one time, the target gets a mark on you and know you are hacking them.  And Spoof Command also doesn't work on everything   This trick only works on devices and agents, not IC, sprites, hosts, personas, or any other icons.   So you'll have to rely on more conventional means for a lot of your hacking regardless.  Clever use of Spoof Command though."

Shadowrun,3chkj7,Wyrdwanderer,12,Tue Jul 7 23:32:30 2015 UTC,"Most magic users absorb magic from the Astral and expel it into the physical world in some way.  Often spectacularly and explosively.  Adepts take that same energy and channel it into their bodies.  Rather than an blast of fire or acid, the adept might become extra fast, super agile, gain extra senses.  It's the same energy as a mage, but rather than changing the world, it changes the user, making them more than what they were.    The thing that needs to be made clear is that this magical change is (mostly) permanent and has become a part of the user - these aren't spells that can be removed, they're new abilities that are just fueled by the same stuff as a spell.  Also, if your players are knowledgeable about comics, comparing adepts to low-power supers such as Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Daredevil, Green Arrow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Punisher, Batman or The Question.

One of them allows for bonuses to Technical or Vehicle skills, so you could be channeling magical prowess into stunt driving, or even computer hacking.  One of the pre-gen characters is a marksman, using magic to enhance their firearm skills.  So really, an Adept is just someone who can use magic to enhance themselves instead of producing magical effects outwards."
Shadowrun,3ck69g,mikkel421427,3,Wed Jul 8 15:28:30 2015 UTC,"It's a dangerous, complex world, with significant differences from daily life in our world you really REALLY have to be diligent explaining stuff for quite a number of sessions, and yeah intervening with reasons when a PLAYER is about to do something he doesn't know is against character.    If after a reasonable amount of time you still have to keep doing it over and over and over for a particular player, AND you talked about it, then if that bothers you enough maybe you should drop the player, not everybody is compatible with every table/system...

Shadowrun,3ck69g,gimlettio,3,Wed Jul 8 16:22:13 2015 UTC,"In my game, I know i've read the book because I'm the GM and I have to, but i'll give most players the benefit of the doubt and say that they haven't read through the mess that is the 5th edition core rulebook. Especially new players, who might be looking to this as an introduction to the system and may not understand the intricacies of the 6th world.   It's your job as the GM to find creative ways to introduce and explain these concepts to them, and you can do it in a fun way without being ""ruthlessly fair"". In the example you gave if this troll was one of their only leads and they end up fighting him and killing him off, and they gotta do some extra leg-work to make up for lost time, and maybe their mark skips town in the meantime. I wouldn't just straight up kill them off for making a rookie mistake, but it should be a learning experience.   I'll give an example i used in my last game, our mage (second time ever playing shadowrun) was going crazy slinging around F12 stunballs everywhere, as was his spirit of man. As he was sleeping off the stun in his apartment, he woke up to a crash and a scream as his female companion is liquefied in bed next to him. An elf shaman and two elf gangers were standing in his doorway. After a brief battle (and assisted by two other runners who lived in the same building) our decker read some chat logs on their commlinks detailing how they tracked this guy back to his apartment using his bound spirit, how they needed to act quickly because the astral signature only lasted for 1 hour per force of the spell, and how this guy was a noob for not erasing his astral signature earlier."

I'm also from the school that says as GM, I get to retcon character backstories and trigger flashbacks at will, provided it is in service of everyone at the table having fun.  Based on that, any time the players don't seem to ""get"" a threat, I like to take the opportunity to fill them in.  I pick one character with an interesting perspective on the issue and point things out that their character would notice.  For instance, if the team is antagonizing a bunch of gangers, I might tell the Decker that ""You notice none of these guys have active commlinks, the only people in the crowd running silent.  In your experience, that makes them either feral ghouls or violent criminals in hiding, and they don't look much like ghouls.""  Tipping the players off like this is a win on a couple of levels.  Obviously, it gives them a chance to make the smart choice, and absolves you of responsibility if they ignore the warning.  It lets you give the spotlight to a character that might not be getting enough attention. Finally, you can sneak in other details about the world that might be useful later - your players know that running silent is significant and potentially useful, and you've also foreshadowed feral ghouls."

Shadowrun,3chw5l,marcus_gideon,2,Wed Jul 8 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"I mean yes, they are there for GM's discretion. But some good guidelines might be:  Force: Lower-force spirits would be more apt to take the Servile quality. Not only are they not as bright, but they don't move and shake much on the metaplanes, and being summoned is going to be more of an honor for them than a burden. Inversely, high-force spirits are generally going to be more restless. Many powerful spirits tend to look down on metahumanity, and most of them have grand, important, spirit-worldy things to take care of.  Tradition/Type: This is an example of flavor affecting numerical play (which is not always positive), but it's worth the GM's consideration. If your summoner is bringing forth a Spirit of Beasts that resembles a dog, or a Spirit of Fire that materializes as a warm candle - anything naturally adapted to serve metahumanity - it would make sense that the spirit would have the Servile quality. A spirit materializing as an eagle, or a lion, or a hurricane (etc) would be more likely to be Restless.  Throwing Players a Bone: If you're one of those GMs who believes the players are your enemies, ignore this suggestion. But if you want, you can always put Servile on a spirit summoned by any mage who has Loss of Confidence in summoning, or is generally a novice. Servile spirits are more attracted to these summoners, perhaps because they are more inclined to be charitable to metahumans. Restless spirits scorn involvement with such neophytes. And of course, if a summoner is calling up spirits left and right, she's going to face more Restless spirits wanting to see what this hotshot is made of.  Just my two cents, though. I'm not an accomplished summoner or GM, just a fan."
Shadowrun,3cj39v,MasteroRave,6,Wed Jul 8 08:35:08 2015 UTC,"I tried a thing last session, inspired by the Cypher system used for Numenera and The Strange (two other RPGs): instead of minor NPCs having actual stats and pools that I roll when they attempt actions their professional rating becomes the threshold/their hits to beat whenever a PC interracts with them in a way that requires rolls.  It speeds things up a ton, though it's not exactly a perfect system hack. I found I had to figure out arbitrarily how dice pool penalties would apply to NPCs with this houserule. In the end I mostly winged it depending on what seemed appropriate for the situation, using the rules for buying hits as a loose indicator (so a -4 dice pool penalty is about equal to decreasing the rating of the NPC by 1).  I only applied this to mooks and grunts though. Any NPCs with a name and an identity or any sort of plot-importance I still rolled as if they had actual stats. I choose to do that because I felt like since they are ""real characters"" in the story and not what basically amounts to ""extras"" their actions carry a certain amount of weight and it's only appropriate that they can randomly fail or succeed spectacularly when you don't expect them to.  It needs more testing but I'll definitely keep doing it in the future."

Shadowrun,3cj39v,McBoobenstein,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:34:37 2015 UTC,"Have you or your players never shot a gun before? Because machine pistols and SMGs respond a hell of a lot differently than a pistol. There's nothing wrong with the firearms group as written. Heavy weapons are separate from it because they generally require some type of military or paramilitary training to operate correctly. And Longarms are your sport and sniper rifles, which again, act nothing at all like an assault rifle.   Again, for those heavy weapons, you need military training to operate them properly. The firearms in the skill group are firearms that are likely the average person in a violent world would run into in a normal lifetime. Heavy weapons only come out when a corp or a country decides that an armored asset needs destroyed, despite possible collateral damage. So, not friggin likely for a ganger to have ever had his hands on one to learn about it. Doesn't belong in the firearms skill group.  Source: Active duty military veteran.

We all have to draw the line somewhere, and for me the issue of realisitic firearms categories is secondary to having a better balance between firearm categories."

Shadowrun,3cikhs,nexquietus,7,Wed Jul 8 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"Clip is a tongue in cheek running gag term in Shadowrun. Everybody (I like to pretend) knows it's the incorrect term, but it's really not a big deal.  I've read it a couple times to work it out and can only assume that your house rule is to effectively make machine pistols fall under the pistols skillset and add burst fire to some of the higher-end pistols.   I think it'd be fair to have machine pistols fall under the pistol skill set, sure, but the rest is too complicated. I like my houserules to simplify things or fix broken systems. Getting nitpicky and futzing with specific weapons to say they may or may not have certain additional select fire capabilities or recoil penalties is not a good application of my time. Pistols and machine pistols have limited slots for mods, which are the main thing used to deal with recoil, that side of things is already well figured and not worth my time fretting over.  You talk about a fair number of things that end up being irrelevant to the point you're trying to make or trail off and go nowhere. If this is just an introductory entry into a running blog, hopefully some of your set-up here will apply there. As a self-contained argument, though, it would benefit from more concise, to the point language. Try making a statement, then immediately back up that statement. Figure out what point you're trying to make and then re-read what you've written to see if you've made that point.  Your suggested house rule is 8 paragraphs long and it is never clear exactly what changes you want to make or why they are better than the current system. The Machine pistols vs Sub Machine Guns vs Pistols section feels like a bunch of trivia with no final point to be made. Is the fact that all of these weapons use pistol caliber ammunition leading up to a unification of their skillset? Are you trying to establish differentiating factors in order to sell us on splitting them up into even more distinct skillsets? I don't know.  I like to hear the opinions of well-informed people regarding the representation of their subject of expertise in different rulesets, and I'm curious to see what more you have to say. If you want to sell me on your house rules, however, they need to be clear, concise, and well reasoned. A wholesale replacement ruleset for firearms is not something I'll be willing to implement in weekly installments, so if that's where you're heading, you would be better served by having one entry with a top-down view of the changes you want to make, followed by entries rationalizing each decision. If you just want to look at the ruleset and make observations piece-by-piece, then you need to completely sell me on your idea in a self-contained article.  TL;DR... You make interesting points but need to clarify them and express them better."
Shadowrun,3cikhs,D_Keller,4,Wed Jul 8 05:37:33 2015 UTC,"Right off the bat... people say ""clip"" or ""mag"" instead of ""magazine"" b/c syllables get friends killed. Same reason they turned ""Nine millimeter"" into ""9mm"" which comes out as ""Nine mike mike""  Needs a TL;DR... you rant a lot before getting to the point. =)  I could agree with calling any kind of ""pistol"" a Pistol skill, any kind of long barreled a Longarm skill, and the tactical shorties basically SMG. I don't think we needed all the separate categories like Machine Pistol or Automatics, since they handle the same as any other until you start using rapid fire. At which point you deal with Recoil penalties just like normal. So why bother calling it a different skill, if you had penalties planned from the start. You'd think special training in Machine Pistols or Automatics would compensate for the Recoil.  However, I wouldn't start turning every pistol on the market into a machine pistol. For one thing, they don't have the ammo capacity, not without the ""magazine"" hanging out the bottom looking terrible. And even if they have enough ammo to sustain a burst or two, the components aren't built for the rate of fire. And if you're completely overhauling all the innards to make it work... it's probably cheaper just go buy a machine pistol off the shelf."

Shadowrun,3cikhs,lshiva,3,Wed Jul 8 06:39:32 2015 UTC,"Firstoff, congrats on your first houserule.    Clips. Holy Crap, how hard is it?   Im impressed with how many people miss this, but the answer is right in the rulebook. Twice. ""And yes, it’s technically a detachable box magazine, but the Cityspeak word for it is so popular these days that even the catalogs call them clips."" (P. 433) Also (P. 417) It may have been a mistake originally, but it's been twenty years and clips are a part of Shadowrun just like Drek, Frag and Wiz.  Your text about the real side of things is informative, but does come across as a bit of a rant. This is the material you're passionate about, but a large part of your readership is not. For those, it gets old fast.    Choose several high end pistols to have the burst fire machine pistol feature for an additional 100 Nuyen and the select fire feature for another 250 Nuyen.   This is a problem balance wise. Compare the stats of machine pistols to heavy pistols and you'll notice that all have no armor penetration and lower damage. Furthermore, only two machine pistols actually have full auto fire, one of those has a small clip and low damage (Fianchetti Military) and the other low Accuracy (Steyr TMP). If you allow Heavy Pistols to have Full Auto Fire you effectively eliminate machine pistols from the game. Moreover, the power of FA in Shadowrun lies in the denial of dodge dice. A Salvalette Guardian can fire a long burst for a -5 to the enemies dodge right now, but it requires a complex action. With the addition of FA, this would drop to a simple action. This drastically changes the action economy.   You're approaching the game mechanics by comparing them to real world shooting. However, Shadowrun is a game based on a lot of assumptions about how shooting works, most of which are generalizations and abstractions. Beyond that, it comes down to a lot of math. The simulations approach you chose does not work in this system because it neglects the assumptions and abstractions the mechanics make.    Weapons listed as machine Pistols are treated as light pistols.   This is a rather common concept and works well enough. I know a few groups that have abandoned the Pistols/Automatics/Longarms/Heavy Weapons approach for a Small/Large/Heavy arms concept.   You are right in that automatics is something of a go-to skill because it is so versatile. However, the solution to that problem isn't to buff pistols. Still, an interesting read though. :)"

Even as an ""enthusiast"" I don't get it - ""banana clip"" was a common term even among the military way before I first heard it in the 1970s.  Is it really SO impossible that in the many years up to the 2050s ""clip"" won't become common usage?

Shadowrun,3cf7rm,CheetahSnake,16,Tue Jul 7 13:15:21 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: There are a lot of very good reasons why insect shamans aren't recommended as player characters, however, there are some options for making this workable.  Short of them having a very, very, very good concept? No. There are so many problems inherent in insect shamanism, even the less objectionable ones like wasp, that it would break almost any group or campaign. First, and most generic, problem: There's a bounty of several thousand nuyen for an insect shaman, several hundred thousand (if I remember correctly) if they're brought in alive. That's a lot of incentive for the other players to screw him (and any progression system you may have) by turning him in. Second problem: Most insect shamans aren't just half insane and, in my opinion, don't mesh well with a runner team. My picture of an insect shaman (non-hive insects being an exception) is someone who wants so desperately to belong to something that they create a cult just to be a follower in it. They want to lose their identity in the greater hive; they're practically suicidal. Rollplaying this through a standard campaign would be incredibly difficult; I don't think I've ever met a player who could pull it off. If you think your player can, then you have an incredible group. (I should note that I go for realistic portrayals of insanity; if your player just wants to have a bug obsession and your OK with it then this isn't a problem). Third problem: Spirit summoning. (Correct me if I'm wrong on this, I don't have the book in front of me so I'm working more off of the fluff.) Insect spirit possession requires a metahuman and is permanent; i.e. after you've run out of tasks the spirit sticks around to do whatever it wants. This can, and probably will, lead to more than a few oops moments. Relating to problem number 2, I should point out that most insect shamans will be compelled to summon more spirits; it's the entire point of their existence. Finally, being a bug shaman is illegal and the solutions for dealing with one tend to be drastically effective. Ares doesn't waste time sending in Pawns, they jump straight to Firewatch. Same applies to the FBI if they catch you first. Not just that, but an insect shaman is one of the few things dangerous enough to get the various governments and corps working together. Everyone remembers Chicago.  All hope is not lost though! A few suggestion to keep the concept alive, in order of my own preference:   Spider Shaman. People confuse them for insects anyway so, lacking any details about your player's concept, it should work all right. In this case you're trading in your cult follower personality for extreme OCD and, depending on your culture, a pretty decent sense of humor. Plus you don't have to worry about the problems inherent in summoned insect spirits. (As an aside, Spider was imprisoned under Uluru until 2050, when a Shadowrunner team accidentally released it.) Toxic Shaman. Still crazy, but for different reasons. This seems like it would allow you to keep a lot of the interesting parts of the character concept while loosing most of the problems (there's still a pretty big bounty, but corps are willing to overlook the illegality part if you're useful enough). This may also provide some interesting (for the whole group) run ideas involving eco-terrorists.  Non-Hive insect shaman (beetle, etc.). AKA 'insect spirit lite',  this would allow you to ditch problem number 2. Unfortunately, this would still leave problems one and three but does allow you to stay closest to your player's original concept.   Hope this helped and, however you chose to deal with this, let us know how it turns out!"
Shadowrun,3cf7rm,pfm1995,11,Tue Jul 7 13:57:37 2015 UTC,"Based on /u/Shakyor recommendation we're considering running a campaign where he has just adopted the tradition and everything starts out good, but as he goes crazier and crazier he slowly becomes a force the other players have to deal with, culminating in him becoming the big bad.

Shadowrun,3cf7rm,rjmkx5,9,Wed Jul 8 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would. However, the player would have to understand that he needs to try to bring a hive into the works and that the players may have to kill him to stop the hive.  To make interesting, I think the player would need to do a bunch of secret rolls and messaging back and forth to keep the suspense and mystery about his ""true"" tradition."

The others in the group should either want him dead if/when they find out or also be targeted for extermination.  What Johnson is gonna hire a team that has a history of insect spirits appearing at their jobs? What fixer would risk their neck to find these guys work?   I suppose a pc Mantis Shaman would work but even that would be stretching it.   Edit: Now that I think about it I suppose a legit insect shaman would be kinda cool. By legit I mean a shaman being contacted by a bug spirit of some sort that actually represents the insects of earth who are upset that those otherworldly imposters are destroying their name.
Shadowrun,3cf7rm,insert_topical_pun,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:36:11 2015 UTC,"I've often floated that very concept. Bug spirits, such as they are, aren't from this plane - and therefore it's entirely conceivable that insects have their own spirits here on our astral plane, probably in hiding either from indiscriminately violent metahumans or the bug spirits themselves.  So a ""true insect"" mentor spirit would probably be a Rat variant, or possibly Eagle or even Dragonslayer. A spirit that calls to the PC shaman to destroy the invaders and return the planes to purity, while forced to be incredibly cautious about its activities and those of its followers."
Shadowrun,3cf7rm,Bamce,15,Wed Jul 8 18:21:45 2015 UTC,No  The first time the character is assensed he and everyone he has ever associated with are dead.

Shadowrun,3cf7rm,NotB0b,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:53:25 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that it would need to be handled very carefully and everyone involved should fully understand what they're getting into, but that doesn't mean it could never work. For instance, the CIA has even gone so far as to work with mantid spirits. That could easily work.  Or maybe, if everyone else in the party + the GM is cool with this sort of thing, the character could try to keep their true nature a secret while also possibly setting up a hive.  As long as everyone understands how likely death is for this character, and what their motivations should be, then it could work.  You don't have to just straight up say ""No"" just because the idea needs extra work. A badass green arrow style archer in Shadowrun needs a bit of work, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't ever play one.  And as for the assensing problem - take masking. Yes, if someone gets past it, then you're screwed, but that risk is a part of the fun. If the cops work out that you're a shadowrunner, you're screwed as well. They might not arrest you now, but they could at any time."

Shadowrun,3cf7rm,duncanmb,4,Wed Jul 8 09:46:36 2015 UTC,No I would not.
Shadowrun,3cf7rm,DisappointedKitten,2,Tue Jul 7 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"I would typically not allow such a character due to the inherent ""anti-good"" nature of the shamanistic path.  The end goal of the shaman is to bring workers and a queen into the material plane at the cost of metahuman life.  It's one thing to shoot a security guard in the face during a run, it's just business for both of you, even if it may weigh heavily on your conscience later.  It's another to knock him out, drag him to your lodge, and invest a spirit into his body, killing a helpless individual in the process.  However...  In the past I've done dual story campaigns in Shadowrun and other systems, culminating in the two parties meeting each other.  Usually this is a ""good meets good"" scenario where ""you see an elf and a dwarf laughing it up at the bar in the back of the tavern"" (because all parties meet in a tavern in D&D), but occasionally this is a ""good meets bad"" scenario where someone, or a couple of someones, have actually been playing bad guys that the other group has been hearing a lot about recently.  The bad players become the big bads, occasionally showing up in the good guy campaign (or vice versa) a few more times until there's a point where the bad guys are just now too bad and they have to forfeit their characters to GM control (the cleric devoted to Gruumsh, or the insect Ant shaman, finally capitulates to their patron's whims and does the previously unthinkable, human sacrifice of the innocent, because now it seems reasonable in their minds).  In this case I would say yes, but be ready to do overtime on your GMing because you'll be running two parallel campaigns at two different times.  Happily running a campaign for two smaller groups (1-2 people per group) is usually quite easy.  And it doesn't last forever, you'll be doing it for a couple of months maybe before the player of the bad guy(s) will be like, ""Yup, nope, I'm done.  Compulsion to kill the cute barista at the corner and going through with it is where I draw the line.  Here you go.  Where's Run Faster, I want to kill this guy now."""
Shadowrun,3cf7rm,Downtym,2,Tue Jul 7 16:06:36 2015 UTC,"No, because it ends one of two ways.  The shaman turns the PCs into bug hosts, or the PCs turn the shaman in a red smear.  If he wants to be crazy, he can be crazy in a way that doesn't end with the inevitable self immolation of the campaign."
Shadowrun,3cf7rm,Shakyor,5,Wed Jul 8 01:59:38 2015 UTC,No. Had way too much infighting over secrets and betrayals in games to deal with it.

And you play Shadowrun because you enjoy cool mechanics?  One piece of advice though:  Openly ask the group what they think about this. And escpially, MOST IMPORTANTLY, ask them whether they would like you to stick the general Shadowrun canon and make the campaign alot about him, let him be hunted, let him have an actually 1 million nuyen bounty OR if they would rather you just say in this world it is nasty, but not too out of the ordinary. Maybe, more like if he would be a rapist, serial killer or something like that. Or if they would like this to be completley handled like a regular tradition."
Shadowrun,3cf7rm,psykulor,5,Tue Jul 7 13:28:58 2015 UTC,"Handling it like a regular tradition would defeat the purpose. If he wants to rep bugs, let him be an Eagle variant, the Beekeeper or something. Bug spirits aren't the spirits of bugs from our world - they're aliens from hell that represent the very worst aspects of ""bugness."" If you want to be a normal shaman that deals in bugs, insect spirit shaman is not the way to go."
Shadowrun,3cf7rm,Shakyor,2,Tue Jul 7 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but maybe some people just want some of this flair and not go all the way?

Shadowrun,3cf7rm,psykulor,3,Tue Jul 7 13:56:58 2015 UTC,"Is he going to spend the run kidnapping people and stuffing them into cocoons?

Unless they're just an Assorted Psychopathic Murder Squad. Which would be fun - but why would an APMS not want to run into trouble with the law?  I concede it would be possible to houserule a highly irregular insect spirit that's more interested in mentoring than assimilating metahumanity. But OP says the guy wants to be insane, so I was starting with that as a base premise."

Shadowrun,3cf7rm,CitizenJoseph,2,Tue Jul 7 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"There would still be a great deal of stigma - but variant mentor spirits can be anything, according to the culture and heritage the runner comes from. In Europe and the Middle East, bees are venerated as friends of man and protectors of nature. Even the Wasp Spirit incursions wouldn't erase that heritage. So what you'd have is a mage (and Spirit) with a lot of 'splaining to do wherever they went - but it would be pretty clear after a hot second that they weren't the same as Wasp Spirit shamans.  Anyway, OP is looking to maybe houserule the ""hunted incessantly"" part of the lore, which is always acceptable."
Shadowrun,3cf7rm,Elaphoil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:13:40 2015 UTC,"The RP bit for being an insect mage would depend on GM and where you are in the campaign.

That said I understand where you're coming from. There are other things you can do to incentivise showing up (rather than punish absence). Work in custom storylines for consistent players (upping Contacts is a good thing too), give them a special item drop after a strong run of showings, not to mention missing the bonus karma (and hanging out with your friends doing a thing you enjoy) is punishment already."
Shadowrun,3chaao,defunctdeity,3,Tue Jul 7 22:54:29 2015 UTC,"Most RPGs are very class and level based. When you are 1st level, you have X hit points, your attack rating is Y, and you have Z special moves you can use. When you level up, now you have (X,Y,Z)+1 and that makes you noticeably better.  Shadowrun doesn't have classes, nor does it have levels. When you start out Street, Standard, or Prime... these are just a broad measurement of how seasoned you are. Wet-behind-the-ears Rookie vs Grouchy Old Veteran. But there is a LOT of wiggle room in-between, and you don't really NEED to have the same amount of Karma to compete.  If someone misses a game here or there, they really aren't missing much. A few Karma shouldn't make or break your character. Especially since it just gets exponentially more expensive to increase your stats as you go. So whether you have 20K or 25K, you still need 50K for that next rank... that kinda thing.  It also depends on how you explain their absence. If they were busy at their day job and couldn't get the time off to go Running, then there's no reason why they would have gained Karma in that same window. If anything, day jobs drain Karma / your will to live. =) But if they were off doing a super secret solo mission... then the player and GM can get together later and run that solo mission on their own. Then they legitimately earn the Karma, and they actually have a story to tell when they get back, instead of ""Oh, you said I was busy? Umm, sure. I was doing a thing.""  As for completely new toons into an existing group... again, it depends on the backstory. If they're a fresh faced recruit straight out of Shadowrunner Community College, then you make them Street. If they're supposed to be somewhat experienced, but not necessarily notable in the community, make them Standard. If they're supposed to be awesome, make them Prime. You don't need to give them precisely the same amount of Karma as the rest had, b/c they haven't done precisely the same things. Standard characters still start out pretty good at their jobs. Sure, they're not the most amazing, but that's what Prime was for. So do you want the new member to be (A) ""a new kid in town looking to make it big"" (B) ""just another guy the Fixer called up"" or (C) ""a real pro who owed your Fixer a favor""?"

Especially since it just gets exponentially more expensive to increase your stats as you go. So whether you have 20K or 25K, you still need 50K for that next rank... that kinda thing.   That's what I was thinking too. Thanks, man.   As for completely new toons into an existing group... again, it depends on the backstory. If they're a fresh faced recruit straight out of Shadowrunner Community College, then you make them Street Level. If they're supposed to be somewhat experienced, but not necessarily notable in the community, make them Standard. If they're supposed to be awesome, make them Prime. You don't need to give them precisely the same amount of Karma as the rest had, b/c they haven't done precisely the same things. Standard characters still start out pretty good at their jobs. Sure, they're not the most amazing, but that's what Prime was for. So do you want the new member to be (A) ""a new kid in town looking to make it big"" (B) ""just another guy the Fixer called up"" or (C) ""a real pro who owed your Fixer a favor""?   Thanks. I think since the other guys are starting with standard character creation, my gut says to stick with standard if someone makes a new character. I'll tackle that bridge when we come to it though."
Shadowrun,3chaao,VoroSR,2,Tue Jul 7 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't throw a Street in with anyone made at Standard, but I might throw in a Prime with a team made at Standard that's been running for a while. Prime over Standard isn't a huge difference. You could also do Sum to Eleven or Twelve instead of the Prime Runner rules."
Shadowrun,3chaao,VendettaViolent,2,Wed Jul 8 00:12:26 2015 UTC,"My GM just instituted a rather clever approach as a way to grant additional incentive to players that get involved outside of the game (and for great RP/or daring moments in game). Dropping a ton of karma on characters can advance them too fast so you do have other things you can do. Raising a contacts rating or granting the player a chip with them can be awesome... but that only extends to that contact.  What my guy did was bring in 'Team Edge'. So each player is granted a point of special edge at the GM's discretion after a particularly good bout of RP or another notable act. He instituted this to give an incentive to working together as a shadowrunning team not only in earning it but in using it as well. Basically that edge can only be used to aid the character you earned the edge point for (So in a group you'd have a table for and you might have a point of edge for Vendetta Violent and none for Shaniator). You can use that edge for perhaps aiding a roll the other guy is making or maybe to save his hoop and pull him out of the path of a bullet.  Now I know that this doesn't exactly work for an incentive to show up, but it's a pretty interesting house rule as an idea on how to award something that benefits the group but DOESN'T directly lead to unwanted or unwarranted karma creep. Perhaps institute a Team Edge Pool, put one edge into it for each person who showed up the previous session and make it accessible by those who were able to make it? If necessary put limitations on what it can be spent on. This makes it so that there is a sweet benefit to having made the previous session and makes it feel like your runner team is more of a 'team'. The guy who missed the session WILL miss having the team pool to draw on but thems the breaks, he has his personal edge for that.  If Edge sounds like it could be too powerful as a pool for your group, you can always revisit the idea of a team dice pool where you can use attendance numbers to fill it and make it refresh at the beginning of each scene. Player who showed up needs 4 extra dice? Draw from the pool. Not as powerful as edge but can certainly help!"

Shadowrun,3chaao,Hobbes2073,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:40:19 2015 UTC,"I've handled it differently in 4A than in 5E. In 4A karma was strictly awarded when you were part of a run; legwork require an entire session so that's maybe 2 karma, but if you weren't there on the actual run you wouldn't get any karma for that, even though your character may have been part of it as an NPC.  In 5E it hasn't yet been necessary to do this since everyone has perfect attendance. But we agreed that I'd bring along an NPC to replace a player character or I'd play their character and everyone gets karma. I do award bonus karma, but I haven't made it a group vote. They're new RPGers but they can get competitive.  Also, replacement characters are of the same power level as the group. That means Karma and Nuyen. That's my policy, but again I don't foresee having to make use of it soon."

Or your character will have to be the most amazing Jack-of-all-trades in order to be a one man team unto themselves. And even if you're capable of filling every role, you can't be in all places at once.  Or a solo game can be amazing, if you're happy just doing your little niche. A solo hacker can dive completely into the Matrix rules, exploring every little nuance of digital life. You can become the most well known anonymous hacker the world has never seen =)  Or you could become a magical Indiana Jones / Lara Croft type, exploring ancient ruins and seeking out forgotten mysteries of the arcane. Puzzles and pitfalls and Nazis, oh my!"
Shadowrun,3cfqna,marcus_gideon,5,Tue Jul 7 16:07:25 2015 UTC,Might have the most fun doing this with a Decker. A host run or even a foundation run could be a solo effort.
Shadowrun,3cfqna,WizardWolf,3,Tue Jul 7 22:47:28 2015 UTC,"Well, as I said in some other Thread before: I actually do a solo campaign right now. With my character of our main campaign I first did a few solo or duo runs (duo with the character of my boyfriend), but as some of the other players started to feel left behind - simply, because the two of them made more money in two weeks, then the rest of the group in two month (which, I might argue, is mostly to them just having a way better street rep, then the rest of the group and also just being quicker with whatever they do) - I started a new character, that exists in the same timeline and might actually cross over in the main campaign for at least one run (because she builds herself a rep to be one of the best assassins and there are several assassins already been sent after one of the characters). And that character just works alone. Yes, she might pay somebody to pay her escape vehicle, but she certainly won't do anything with a group, because she thinks, that most people just don't understand, what it means to be an assassine.   Till now it even was surprisingly easy. Though it might be, that assassinations are actually really something, that - as long you are not planning to kill a dragon - you might best carry out alone. And she only takes assassination jobs.  Though I might add, that I in generell tend to build characters, that have an average dice pool of 7 in most central areas (anything running, some research, hiding, first aid and so on) and then 10 to 12 in one or two areas. Aka: My characters are rarely overspecialized and more ""Jacks of all trades"". Which makes doing solo runs so much easier."
Shadowrun,3cfqna,RunnerPakhet,2,Tue Jul 7 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"I have done it as both GM and player..  it's hard. When I played it was RP heavy characters, lots of legwork, negociating and such. The entire campaign needs to be built around the character so you need to build a stronger character (base characters aren't well rounded enough). It helps if the character has a strong unique bias/flair."
Shadowrun,3cfqna,Hermit9,2,Tue Jul 7 16:02:54 2015 UTC,"A player could always play 2 chars, like a decker and a combatty sidekick/bodyguard.   Or a mage or rigger - they come with their own minions.    Or allow the player to hire some subcontractors, preferably as a back-up if things go wrong (because to my mind, if you're doing the work of GMing a whole team every run especially if you GMPC the subcontractors, you might as well just get more actual players)  It would sure be cool for testing runs/security designs, it would go a LOT faster with just 1 player managing the whole runner team.  Or move up a level, and have the player play a Johnson,  or Johnson/Team Leader, get a budget and see how much he can keep out of it while still hiring a good-enough team to complete missions.  I always thought it'd be cool to play like regional corp managers, and strategically plan runs against each other for maximum effectiveness accomplishing what the corp board tells you your quarterly goals are:   gain market share vs some specific competitor(s)/increase your R&D advantage/whatever by splitting your budget among investments, defending your assets, voluntary or forced extractions, data-steals, feints, etc.   Would need some rules though..."
Shadowrun,3cfqna,gimlettio,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"I think the last bit would be doable with a good deal of houseruling. Maybe I'll try to write a ruleset for it in my free time.  For a sidekick I'd probably have them have one major character with a full sheet and one simple sheet, essentially just qualities and some basic dicepools, etc. like the way the statblocks are written in the book. Having two full sheets would be a bit of a hassle for players."
Shadowrun,3cfqna,CheetahSnake,2,Wed Jul 8 08:38:16 2015 UTC,"I have done it as a GM, and its honestly a lot of work.  Every mission needs to be perfectly suited for the character and the character needs to be built for all around competence.    Designing each mission in a way that this character can do it with no help is nearly impossible, especially when you factor in that if anything goes wrong, you're humped."
Shadowrun,3cfqna,marcus_gideon,2,Tue Jul 7 15:54:16 2015 UTC,That's only if you expect to use the stereotypical missions. A Fixer wouldn't hire a single guy to fulfill a team task. So you as the GM need to come up with solo missions.
Shadowrun,3cfqna,Harbinger_X,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:11 2015 UTC,"An interesting solo-mission idea might also be a team task gone bad:  Either a traitor on the team or simply some fateful event results in the team being converted to the player alone and the run being changed drastically. The setup for this might be a bit odd, but it could be a pretty fun run for the right sort of GM and player."
Shadowrun,3cfqna,ChromeEagle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:35:51 2015 UTC,"There are already a few solo Run concepts in Shadowrun:  The typical Matrix exploit-orgy, your astral reconnaisance,  ordeals for awakened character intiation, having a smuggler mule some piece of gear over the border, a special agent type, who is stealing something from a guarded site, without anybody knowing, or the detective, who is following leads on a government conspiracy.  Usually many of these leave out a lot of people on a gaming table. So when you're putting a solo run together it's important to play to a characterds strengths, while letting his/her weaknesses pose a problem, for which a roleplaying solution can be found.  Also: NPC support, many groups I've seen do not care for the matrix and have an NPC Hacker open the doors for a tiny fee, why should a solo Runner not have support on call? (c.f. Metal Gear Solid: Snake/Raiden do have experts on call, no need to know everything)"

Edit: Tired me no typ gud."
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,hans_co,12,Tue Jul 7 02:24:20 2015 UTC,"A few things the others left out that are kinda cool:   Something the first guy alluded to, but the ""left behind vs. brought along"" problem applies to both the Matrix and magic - although I'm talking about the Matrix side more, because magic is still not my mechanical strong suit. The inclusion of decks was less important - in 4e, it was literally in your best interests for the hacker to never leave his house. He'd sit at home, doing all the hacking work, and never be unsafe. In 5e, they've jacked up the defenses of all the Matrix systems and then given benefits to going in in-person to beat them (DNI, the mag-lock outside the building that's slaved to the host has a low firewall so you can hack it easily, and this essentially let's you hack the server the entire building is connected to for free). Limits and Accuracy are a BIG thing in 5e. The idea that you cap the highest number of successes on a dice pool to some value associated with stats (or, in the case of guns, a value based on the kind of gun). This means that no matter how good you are with a firearm, if it's a snub-nosed off the street you're going to struggle to hit someone: you're capped at just a few successes. A sniper rifle, on the other hand, has a high upper limit, but you need the underlying dice pool to make it fire accurately. This applies to social, mental and physical activities too: so no matter how much of a fluke you roll, there are some things that are just impossible. Now admittedly as splats are released and more content becomes available, there are more ways to increase these values so they become less burdensome, they are still an important part of gameplay that factor into decision making.   There are a bunch of other things I'm no doubt leaving out (technomancy nerfing, the default chargen mechanism being priority-based rather than point-buy, etc.) but those two were the really significant changes I've felt in 5e.  GM tools - the game does come with 'random run generator', and Run Faster has a 'contact generator' (just a bunch of tables and dice-rolling really). Pretty standard mook/minion rules for keeping bigger combats running quicker. Because it's a point-buy system, NPCs don't have a level but they're organised by ""professional rating"" into groups. Actually one of the more interesting ideas is that they've introduced a ""strongly recommended karma (experience) and nuyen for a run"" concept based on the highest dice-pool rolled against the PCs, along with a few modifiers based on enemy difficulty and moral compass of the run. If you're looking for something more tangible, there's Chummer5, the latest iteration of character building software. Given the amount of options you're given (which is Shadowrun's shining strong suit), it gets pretty necessary as we get deeper into the edition - otherwise you fall prey to the ""I read about this cool thing I want to buy, but which of my twenty PDFs is it in? Ugh!""  In terms of 1-on-1 gameplay? I've run a pretty fun game at that scale, but it does feel VERY different. Part of the joy of Shadowrun for me has always been the planning and co-ordination of a very difficult run, and one player makes it a lot more ""I can wing it as I go"", and a lot less about ""how do we cover each other's weaknesses?"" One-on-one play is fantastic and I'd argue probably allows you to crowbar in more story as there's less time spent on overhead and contingency planning.  HTH, see you in the shadows chummer :)"

Shadowrun,3cdmrv,garner_adam,6,Tue Jul 7 06:44:41 2015 UTC,"Strengths of the system in comparison to other game systems     Has systems for multiple styles of game play. This isn't just reducing entire styles down to a single roll. An interesting initiative system. If played straight is one of the few games that tries to deal with some of the strangeness about turn based combat. For example in Shadowrun you declare all the things you want to do during your turn and then resolve them. Solid gear rules. Most games desperately need an availability system but simply don't have them. Shadowrun's availability system makes customizing areas and parts of games easy. Plus if your players do want to go shopping it doesn't play out like GM-Go-Fish. There are rules for if you can find it and how much it will cost if it's rare. Few if any games cover the nuances of technology the way Shadowrun does. It has discrete rules for a variety of sensors and how to defeat them. One of the chapters details various security systems. It has usable chase scene rules with actual options and tactics. A lot of people will say Magic, Matrix, Meat but this game has another game within it which is the chase driving rules and once you and your players figure those out it's a lot of fun. You can roleplay a lot of jaded people smoking constantly."
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,SmellyTofu,3,Tue Jul 7 06:44:17 2015 UTC,You can roleplay a lot of jaded people smoking constantly.   aww yissss  thanks for the post!
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,garner_adam,2,Tue Jul 7 06:54:38 2015 UTC,Which chapter talks about the nuances of technology?
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,marcus_gideon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:07:51 2015 UTC,In GM advice there is a section called Security Devices. It's a shame it's in the GM chapter because it has a A LOT of information that would be useful to players. In it for example it describes the exact procedures for defeating a variety of technologies and right after that gets right in to SINS.
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,marcus_gideon,5,Tue Jul 7 23:22:20 2015 UTC,"1) What makes Shadowrun appealing, compared to most other RPG settings, is the open ended nature of the world. It's futuristic, cyberpunk, but with magic. So you could be hired to steal secrets from a Corporate office highrise. Or beat the cybernetic army guarding the warehouse and steal the prototype. Or maybe someone's uncovered some ancient ruins and unleashed evil Spirits that need banished. There's a novel out there, where the team gets hired to help facilitate the summoning of Cthulhu. So pretty much, if you pick a genre, you could make it happen.  SR5 in particular is the best attempt so far to merge Meat, Magic, and Matrix together at once. Instead of games solely focusing on gun bunnies, or hackers, or wizards, you can have them all handling their niche at the same time. Shooting at each other, casting spells and summoning Spirits, and hacking into databases (or hacking the other guys guns to stop them from shooting back).  2) If you've played World of Darkness (another point based system I'm familiar with) then you know how the basic stats work. X points in Strength, Y points in Brawling. When you punch someone, you roll X + Y dice, and see how many successes you roll. If it's against someone, it's contested dice rolls. If it's to punch through a wall or something, the GM decides on some number you need to meet or beat to break through. So the GM could just ""wing it"" through the game, having you roll whatever makes sense at the time, with target numbers that seem appropriate. The game has a lot of those things written down already, in fact pretty much anything you could want to do has mechanics somewhere, but it's possible just to make it up if you wanted.  3) It would't be ""difficult"", but it would be a different game than group play. Generally, you'd want a ""well rounded"" team, so your missions could span a variety of topics. Back to the warehouse and the prototype. If there's magical defenses, guardian Spirits, stuff like that... then your single player gun bunny is hosed. Or if the building was protected by drones and electronic locks, you sure could use a hacker instead. Now as the GM, you could just toss in a bunch of NPCs to handle all those things. But it's just going to highlight how little your single player gun bunny contributes to the team, when all they do is shoot at things once in a while."
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,bbsr,3,Tue Jul 7 02:54:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! To be clear, I'm not asking for what's cool about the SR setting--I'm familiar with it and I like it a lot. I'm also generally familiar with the rules, and they look to be fairly standard stuff among more traditionally-designed games.  I'm asking what YOU, SR 5th lover, find to love about the rules of the game. Why do you play the Shadowrun setting with these rules?"
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,Wendicome_Wendigo,5,Tue Jul 7 04:14:23 2015 UTC,"Well... In a way, I'd say that the fact there is a rule for just about anything makes this ruleset pretty awesome. At the same time, it makes it a huge PITA to try and find that particular rule when the time comes. These books could DEFINITELY do with some decent editors. You know that saying about monkeys and typewriters and the works of Shakespeare? Well before they got to Hamlet and Macbeth, they wrote Shadowrun. =)  The system in general is pretty awesome, the setting is great for being able to play just about anything you can imagine. But there are times when the rules leave a lot to be desired. Like a functional Index, or getting rid of contradictory rules. I think it does a good job at what it does, form a coherent ruleset for such a varied game setting. But it could still be done better, which is why there's so many ""house rules"" out there. GMs who said ""Well, it may say ABC... but at my table it's going to be XYZ.""  Why do I play SR5? Probably b/c it's easier to round the edges, than to reinvent the wheel."
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,marcus_gideon,2,Tue Jul 7 04:35:43 2015 UTC,"Seconded. The greatest thing about SR's rules is how in depth and comprehensive they are. Reading the rules as a player or GM the thing that jumps out the most is the sheer amount of things your character can do. Most RPGs shape what your PCs will do based on what the rules focus on. So in D'N'D nearly every problem will be resolved by fighting. In SR ""go break in some building"" can be resolved by: fighting, building a bomb to explode a wall, bribing the guards, hacking the locks, picking the locks, turning invisible and sneaking past the guards, mind controlling the guards to let you in, digging up info on the guards and blackmailing them to let you in, flying a helicopter you've stolen to the top of the building and rapelling down to the floor you need then smashing in the windows, using magic to levitate your team and their ride up to the window you need to get in, capturing a guard shapeshifting into him and pretending to be him whilst you sneak in, hacking the payroll so that you are now employed as a guard then just strolling past security until someone notices, seducing the guards, conning them etc. And there are rules, clear ""here is a table with numbers"" style rules to resolve all of that. You're limited only by the imagination of your players and the gear, skills and abilities of their characters.  This is also SR's biggest flaw. Everything has a rule, and in the heat of a game finding the rule in the terribly designed books can be difficult and frustrating. As a GM though you're obviously used to winging it but if a situation ever crops up where you're not sure what dice would resolve it you can bet somewhere in the books is the answer.  Also I really like the magic system, it's much better than D'n'D or Pathfinder. You know a set number of spells (and can learn more as you gain XP/Karma) and can always cast, all your spells. But every time you cast you risk hurting your character. You get to decide how powerfully to cast each spell and the more powerful the cast the more damage you risk doing to your character. This means that the spells scale infinitely so rather than having to learn a small fieball, medium fireball and big fireball the rules for all fireballs are the same just the damage scales with how much force the mage wishes to cast it at. Also sustaining spells has an inbuilt cap as each spell you sustain cust 2 dice of all your rolls making it progressively more difficult to do anything. The cor emagic rules are really well thought out and intuitive, some of the individual spells are poorly conceived and confusing but in general I find SR to be the quickest game to pick up the magic side of."

Shadowrun,3cdmrv,TinyEmperor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:18:30 2015 UTC,Could you please sum up the differences between 4E and 5E to me? I'm considering getting into 5E just based on the splatbook guns in 5E being way less redundant than those in 4E core plus Arsenal.
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,RunnerPakhet,3,Tue Jul 7 04:14:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I could sum up ALL the differences...  As I mentioned above, SR5 tries to merge the flow of the game as far as Meat, Magic, and Matrix at once. Once upon a time, everybody would kick in the door with guns blazing. They'd fight their way to the mainframe, and then the Decker would plug in and start hacking. At which point, all the gun bunnies could get up from the table and go get dinner. Handling Matrix combat and actions was pretty involved and time consuming, to the point that Meatsuits got bored. Same went for Mages when they wander into the Astral to seek out some sparkly bit of magic. While it's still possible to focus on those settings and make a big deal out of them, the mechanics have made room for hacking and casting in the middle of the firefight without taking away from the flow of the game.  Speaking of hacking (admittedly, my favorite subject), SR1-3 were all about hardwired networks. Even though it was ""the future"", it was the future as the 80's saw it. So the Deckers still carried a huge contraption everywhere they went, and they had to plug straight into the mainframe to get anything. SR4 finally admitted that WiFi is a thing, and probably will be in ""the future"" as well. But they opened the doors wide and let anybody with a Smartphone become an NSA level hacker. They got rid of Decks, and thus got rid of Deckers as a niche. But in SR5, they put the safeguards back in place that prevent any random Joe from hacking into stuff. Now you need a specialized piece of equipment with sufficient processing power and the necessary software to hack into things; you need a Cyberdeck again. And although the world has gone WiFi, the closer you are to something, the better the signal gets. So hackers can't just hide out in the basement anymore, they need to tag along with the team."
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,Daihatschi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:28:08 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, okay---I knew SR4 had wireless, I just didn't know they brought back cyberdecks in SR5. And I knew about the tedious babysitting in SR3.  I think I'll look into SR5 then---sounds like the best-of-all-planes approach I've been hoping for, or darn close to it. I previously stuck with SR4 because the core splats for it were very comprehensive, but this looks more thought-out if not quite as comprehensive yet."
Shadowrun,3cdmrv,Tinyturtle75,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:46:03 2015 UTC,"It is the only system I know of that gives a solid shot at trying to combine  ""Magic, Matrix, and Machine"" into a single game and give equal amounts of attention to each.  Many RPGs boil down many of those areas to a single roll.  Or, even worse, make them way too complex.    If you want to see hackers having to face the same sort of intensity and table time that a mercenary does in a firefight, Shadowrun shines.  If you want the mage to have to make tough tactical decisions like a spec ops solider, Shadowrun shines.    If you want to focus on only one of those areas, ditch Shadowrun.  It will bring too much to the table for you.    Bonus: If you like reading, Shadowrun has more fluff for GMs than most systems.  We're talking entire books for GMs, and a massive chapter in the core book just dedicated on how to ""run a run"", so to speak.      Bonus 2:  Very difficult unless you do one of the following: Make the campaign easy, add tons of DMPCs, or let the player create James Bond.   It's like trying to run a D&D game with one player - there's too many roles to cover for the typical encounter or run."

The dr.auslander in this version has been slightly nerfed in comparison to the romero & juliet version, if you want him to be the group killing asshole again that slings pre-edged toxic waves at the group, just give him back his edge.

Free Spirits could wander the world, and the Astral, and the Metaplanes... that's a wee bit too powerful for PCs."
Shadowrun,3cdm7c,marcus_gideon,2,Tue Jul 7 02:35:26 2015 UTC,Is that official reasoning or just your take on it?
Shadowrun,3cdm7c,marcus_gideon,5,Tue Jul 7 02:41:08 2015 UTC,"That's just my take on it... I could use some Google Fu and see if there's an official response. But I'm pretty sure it would be along the same lines.  They've always said that they won't allow Teleportation, and Resurrection. If you were a Free Spirit, then you could step into the Astral, whisk off around the globe, and rematerialize moments later. Essentially teleporting. Now while it's possible for players to use an Astral Gate, they are at the whims of the Greater Spirit controlling it. So it's not a free pass for them to hop around the world.  And if a Free Spirit were defeated, they would just return to their home plane and come back later. The only way to kill a Spirit is to follow them to that plane and kill them there. But at that point, you're an outsider and he's among friends. So again, not something regular players should be getting away with freely.  These are just a couple of examples that spring to mind, as to why a Free Spirit would be too powerful of an entity to allow for PC use. It's why they're reserved for special occasion NPCs as well. If everywhere you looked, there were Free Spirits wandering about... you need to lay off the 'shrooms =)"
Shadowrun,3cdm7c,marcus_gideon,3,Tue Jul 7 02:59:03 2015 UTC,"I know this is unrelated, but do you maybe know anything about how the Artisan's Way in Street Grimoire didn't get any enhancements or whatever?"
Shadowrun,3cdm7c,PalosApep,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:14:32 2015 UTC,"Well, from looking at all the Artisan's Way (SG pg 176) gives them...  Adept Centering usually just cancels out penalties to Combat and Physical skills. If you were Grade 5, but you has a -2 penalty to something, the extra +3 is useless. But an Artisan can apply the extra +3, or if there were no penalties to start with, could apply the full +5. That's pretty powerful compared to any other Adept.  SG pg 156 says that no matter which Way you follow, you can still choose from the Undecided Way list. So you're not really missing out on anything, they just didn't come up with any special Enhancements on top of giving you access to Vehicle and Technical skills, where every other Adept doesn't get to count those."
Shadowrun,3cdf76,menlin,3,Tue Jul 7 01:21:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm for an Adept if you do Magic C I think you're gonna need Metatype D, so you can use the extra Special Attribute points to raise the Magic from 4->6 so you can get the full 6 Adept Power Points and have 1 left to raise Edge (Edge is really handy).   Try it both ways, buying the magic w/Karma and keeping Resources D for equipment vs Meta D/Resource E.  You really always want 6 magic so you can get all 6 PP at chargen, otherwise you only get PP from Initiation.  As an Adept, you can really skimp on equipment and buy the gear you are missing as you make money from runs.  You should really only need to do a few Karma->nuYen at chargen to get basic armor/gun/SIN/cheapo commlinks/tag eraser and some subset of the eq from the various Recommended Starting Gear lists here.  That's for pure Adept.  If you try to go Mystic Adept it gets a bit harder because now you have to pay 5 karma/Power Point at chargen, so bam there goes 30 karma you coulda used for cool stuff like Qualities or Attributes.  It can be worth it 'cause you get spells and summoning - but now you gotta buy Spellcasting and Summoning skills, and Assensing and almost certainly Counterspelling.   And to do all that well you're putting a LOT of resources into areas that don't sound like you wanted it to be the focus of your character..."

If the TM can Electrokinetically connect to things that were otherwise hardwired and non-wireless, that's a heck of a perk hidden among the ""it's just a Control Rig"" Echo.  If the device did have wireless, then the TM could connect anyway. They don't need any extra excuses, aside from the inherent ""your brain is a Cyberdeck"" they already get.

Here I am arguing against an Echo that lets you connect to things, yet rooting for an ordinary Complex Form that would instead. The difference being the fluff excuse behind it.  ""Your brain is a Control Rig"" seems pretty straight forward, you just apply Control Rig perks to dealing with drones. Same as a Rigger.  ""You connect through Resonance Channels instead of Matrix channels"" makes it sound like Resonance flows in ways the Matrix doesn't. Which, in my mind, sounds like you could talk to digital devices where the wireless Matrix is cut off.  Of course, since the original Echo was called ""Mind over Machine"", then you could say you're Electrokinetically affecting the device whether it has Wifi or not. With the same logic as the Resonance connection.  I like my idea better, b/c it's cheaper. You can buy Forms all day long, but Submergence is hard. =)"

Shadowrun,3ccjqt,marcus_gideon,3,Mon Jul 6 23:15:41 2015 UTC,"The big things that make a Rigger are; the Control Rig implant (a fancy Datajack), and the Rigger Control Console (RCC) (a fancy Cyberdeck).  Mechanically... the only thing you gain from using a Control Rig is;   An extra state of being online. Offline / AR / VR / Jumped In. So it takes that much longer to get ready, or to get clear if you're at risk of Dumpshock. You treat Vehicle actions as Matrix actions, so the +2 for Hot Sim applies. The limits of your Vehicle actions, as well as the Thresholds are modified by the rating of the Control Rig (1-3). 1/2 of any damage the vehicle / drone suffers while you're Jumped In hits you as Biofeedback. Cold-Sim = Stun, Hot-Sim = Physical. Matrix damage targeted at the vehicle / drone you're Jumped Into affects you / your RCC instead of the drone itself. So you save the drone from getting bricked, by getting yourself bricked instead.   These are the only things you gain from using a Control Rig... Thematically, you get to become the vehicle, you experience life running down the highway at 60 mph, blah blah blah. But that's all just fluff. From a game mechanics standpoint, you really don't gain much, and you suffer damage when your drone body gets shot up or someone plays bumper cars with your getaway van.  Whereas...   Any hacker can go into VR and basically experience life from the drone's perspective. They won't become the drone, but they could be surrounded by floating viewscreens of all the drone sensory data. You can use Control Device to give the drone all the same Vehicle commands as a Rigger would, and if you're Hot-Sim, you'd still get the +2 bonus. You don't get the bonuses to Limits or Thresholds. Any damage the drone suffers, doesn't hurt you in the slightest. Maybe you have a life bar like a video game, and when the drone dies then the words GAME OVER float before your eyes. But since you weren't inside the drone, then you don't suffer Dumpshock when it explodes from gunfire.   Now...  I didn't mention the RCC yet, b/c pretty much all of its functions work whether you're a hacker with drones or a Rigger with implant.   If you're a Rigger networking your drones through the RCC, you can transition from inside one drone directly into another with a single action. Without an RCC (if you were networking your drones through a Commlink or something) you'd have to spend one action to get, and another action to get into the next. For any user, you can issue a single command to all the drones networked through an RCC at once. Instead of saying “Roto-drone A, attack. Roto-drone B, attack. Lynx A, attack. Lynx B, attack” eating up actions with each order… you can say “Attack” and all the drones receive it at once. For any user, the RCC can boost Noise reduction to make controlling drones over great distances easier. You can make an Electronic Warfare check to temporarily boost the Noise reduction. For any user, the RCC can share out a single copy of Autosofts to all applicable drones. Instead of installing 10 copies of Roto-Drone Maneuvering into each one, you put out a single copy to all 10 at once. Since all the drones are Slaved to the RCC, they are all protected by the RCC’s Firewall.   All of these functions (aside from fast transitions) are available to anyone with an RCC, even a hacker who just happens to own some drones.  So really… there’s not a whole lot of reason to be a Techno-Rigger, when you could just be a Technomancer who uses drones."

Shadowrun,3cbd27,Feynt,5,Mon Jul 6 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"/u/therumisallgone/ answered most of your questions.  I'll just answer the last two in a bit more detail.   Sustained spells can be sustained regardless of plane.  The only requirements are on the initial casting.  So a spirit can cast Improved Reflexes on you and then de-materialise.  Regardless of its plane of existence, the sustained spell's magical energies are astrally bound.  Remember though that just because something is only on the astral plane doesn't mean it's immune to tampering.  Also, spirits are fickle and subject to GM whims.  Treat your spirits well.  >) AoE indirect spells are mentioned to be grenades.  As mentioned, you do a simple Spellcasting + Magic (3) test to try to land the spell just where you want it.  If you fall short (say, only 2 successes), you have to roll for scattering as per the rules on page 182 of the core rulebook.  The damage of the spell is its force + net successes past the threshold, but it's slightly unclear as to whether damage becomes grenade like (landing squarely where it's supposed to and doing full damage) or is still a Rea + Int evasion test.  Considering the AoE nature of the spell and its otherwise grenade like status, I'm more inclined to say it's grenade-like damage that can't otherwise be avoided.  So that Force 6, 5 success Powerball is doing 11P damage to its primary target and 11-(distance in meters)P to anyone else (friend or foe) in the area.  Similar to HE grenades, but still less powerful (16P for HE grenades).  The difference is your ""ammo"" is your consciousness, not the amount of little spherical metal balls you have on you."
Shadowrun,3cbd27,Holoholokid,2,Mon Jul 6 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a Demo Agent, we pretty much consider Indirect AoE spell damage to be the same as a grenade and un-dodge-able in the same way. There is no dodge and damage is force of the spell + net hits above the 3 needed to ""zero"" the spell in exactly where you want it. Oh, and don't forget indirect combat spells also get AP equal to the force of the spell."
Shadowrun,3cbd27,VDRawr,5,Mon Jul 6 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can take Innate Spells as many times as you have optional powers. Different spell you know each time.  Yeap, spirits can sustain their own stuff. If it's a regular power, they get no penalties for sustaining it. For innate spells, they do get the -2.  It works like a power. That's never explicitly stated, but think about how useless a Spirit of Man with Innate Spell: Heal would be otherwise. Heal needs to be sustained a number of turns equal to the force it's being cast at before it becomes permanent. That would cost you 5 or 6 services right there.  You can cast any Mana Spell, identified by the little M, when you're in the astral. How exactly those then work depends on your GM. There's no hard rule.  Yeah, you can keep sustaining spells while you go astral, no problem.  Indirect AoE spells, as written in the rulebook, do not work. As you mention, the book gives contradictory information. Pick a houserule with your group and run with it. (Also, does anyone know how those are handled in the organized play stuff?)  I like ""Roll Spellcasting + Magic, apply any relevant counterspelling, compare to threshold 3 to determine scatter, then make anyone actually hit roll Rea + Int, with net hits increasing the damage, but the spell still doing it's base damage even if they roll higher than you, similar to how a grenade works.""  Also, for spirits, keep in mind the whole ""One service per power use"" thing is only when you explicitly ask the spirit to use that power in this way. If you ask the spirit to help you  with a fight, the spirit might end up using a whole bunch of powers during the fight, but the entire thing is still only one service. How far you can go with this depends on the GM. Getting ""Heal all 5 of us"" probably counts for more than one service, for example."
Shadowrun,3cbd27,digitalpacman,2,Mon Jul 6 16:56:00 2015 UTC,"How are indirect AOE combat spells rolled?   Just like grenades.  Go look at the grenade section. Basically you roll against a fixed threshold (3), modified by range and stuff. I think for spells, net hits add damage, grenades don't.  If you do not get 3 hits, you risk scatter, which means it might come flying back at you.  Scatter is roll 2d6.  A 2 and 12 means it comes back towards you (yikes!). roll to hit. If not 3 hits, roll scatter and roll distance from location using the scatter table subtracted by your original net hits. AoE stuff is SUPER easy. GMs have to punish players from using grenades not using mechanics, but using the world.  Generally, in shadowrun, AoE effects are bullshit overpowered because there is no defense test. There is only resistance (damage soak).  BUT, in run&gun there is an interrupt action ""run for your life"" that allows someone to take -5 to take the rest of their movement, out of their turn, to move.  AFTER the AoE grenade/spell test is made and destination is chosen, anyone can take the run for your life interrupt and choose direction and how far to run (limited by your distance per combat turn. out of distance? you dead).  If scatter is going to happen, runners dont know until after they run. Tough luck chums."

Shadowrun,3cabfi,Hibiki54,9,Mon Jul 6 09:53:31 2015 UTC,"I dunno, without knowing all sides of this it's obviously hard to know what the full story is, and god knows I've met a ton of players who sound just like that.  BUT:  He's playing a new character from chargen who he has not operated in the world, right?   And yet the SIN he paid 2.5BP for is already tainted, AND it's a fake sin yet it points right back at his  brother 2200 miles away?   I'd be a little irked about that too, what a shitty fake SIN! - did the other players get pristine, untainted fake SINs for the BP they spent?    Why wasn't his sin a fresh fake SIN that his character got just before travelling to N.O. knowing he had to get disassociated from whatever old trouble he had?  Another thing I hope you're doing is explaining this stuff in advance (""Lone Star is going to check your SIN, YOUR CHARACTER KNOWS that it can be traced back to your brother etc are you sure you still want to do this?"",""YOUR CHARACTER KNOWS Lone Star HQ has SIN checking machines that will easily detect a rating 2 fake SIN"", etc.) and not suddenly springing ""LOL Lone Star runs this SIN you thought was fresh because you paid chargen points for it and haha you're screwed"".  And ""YOUR CHARACTER KNOWS that if he kills this guy he will violate his creed are you sure you still want to fire that APDS?"" - remember that players only think about their characters for a few hours, with gaps of a week to a month that can make things hard to recall in a rules-heavy detailed world...  All the other stuff does make him sound like a tool though, so if you really have been doing all the above over and over and over to help him, I agree with the other posters it'd probably be better to just drop him instead of torturing him and everybody else."

Lesson Learned:  ""GM will examine every bit of attempted flavor to find ways to fuck me over.""  PLAYER:  ""I have a fake ID at a level the GM who built my character felt a competent character would think was good"" Lesson Learned:  ""GM will not warn me of something my PROFESSIONAL TERRORIST character with years of experience would know was a major risk, in order to fuck me over.""  PLAYER:  ""OK, you fucked me, I need a new SIN, something every runner easily gets 1-5 of, plus tons of regular people manage to acquire somehow"" Lesson Learned:   ""GM who built my character gave me a shitty useless fixer who can't even get me an availability 6 replacement, other players won't lift a finger to help me from being fucked over"" I mean come on, avail 6, how many times did you let him try, and wtf happened?

Seriously, WTF kind of fixer can't get at least a L2 fake SIN in 1 or 2 tries?   And if they failed once let alone twice,  why aren't his teammates trying their other contacts?  Plus you wanted to charge him more than list price, in a smuggling city nexus with a long history of corruption,  because ""fuck you""?

Shadowrun,3cabfi,DeathEatsCurry,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:50:42 2015 UTC,He is NOT playing a new character from chargen. The PC he is playing now was originally a NPC in the previous campaign.

Shadowrun,3cabfi,Beaumis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:38 2015 UTC,No. He was given the option of playing a new character for the next campaign. EVERYONE in the group did that except him. It was his choice to play his original character's brother (who was an NPC in the previous campaign).
Shadowrun,3cabfi,RunnerPakhet,11,Wed Jul 8 00:15:57 2015 UTC,"To be absolutely honest, you sound like you don't want to play with this guy anymore. Frankly, I wouldn't want to play with this guy. It seems to me like your group needs to sit down and have a talk. Issues like this can be resolved but for that everyone needs to understand that there are issues."
Shadowrun,3cabfi,felicidefangfan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:53:38 2015 UTC,"Pushing the Envelope  The PC was originally an NPC that existed in the previous campaign. The player was originally playing a CRB pre-gen and wanted to have a back-up character in case he died. The original PC asked his fixer (a powerful NPC who organizes and manages a P2.0 feed that records and televises Runner job) to help his brother out and get him from Seattle to Los Angeles because his brother was also burned at the same time the original PC was burned (All PCs started in Seattle, but were burned on a job and moved to Los Angeles for story purposes). The fixer was the NPCs benefactor and worked for the NPC after he arrived in Los Angeles. When the team (except two of us) were burned and labeled as terrorist in the PCC (end of campaign), all NPCs associated with the Fixer (who also was afflicted with CFD) were either dead or burned and had to hide out. That would include the player's NPC brother/back-up character.  The GM indicated that the events in the previous campaign will effect the next campaign. Every player knew that, yet the player in question still chose to play his NPC character believing that nothing from the previous campaign should effect him. He is essentially playing a PC that has a GM created backstory from the previous campaign, yet he considers that unfair and claims his character is gimped because of that."
Shadowrun,3cabfi,Roxfall,2,Tue Jul 7 02:47:05 2015 UTC,"I see two issues here that need to be resolved separately if you want this to work out:   The player sounds like a typical victim of the ""I was told but not asked"" problem. He knew all the stipulations, but his behavior suggests he feels they were sprung on him. He reacts by acting out because he doesn't much care for the character. The best solution to this, actually the only real solution to this, is to return the curent PC to the NPC pool and let him make a new character. Maybe the prison/ childhood/ drinking body of the Brotherly Duo that no one knew about. Just handwave it. It's obvious that the character he is playing in his mind and the one in the campaign are two different PCs. The guy will never care for a character that at his heart he doesn't want to play.  The second issue is you and him. I don't know about the rest of the group. The character you made matters to you and it hurt you to see it ""perverted"". You obviously care for the game to go a certain way. Unless you communicate that directly, you will be unhappy with the way things go. People don't wake up thinking ""hey, I should change the way I have fun because X seems a little upset"". Talk to the player, maybe the group, but stick to your issues with the situation. Always remember, your definition of cool is not his definition of cool. Unless you find a middle ground between those definitions, you will not be happy.   All this operates under the assumption that you guys are friends. Friends work stuff like this out."
Shadowrun,3cabfi,Roxfall,4,Tue Jul 7 07:40:39 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I can understand you very well. Especially considering, that you originally build the character yourself.  Sadly a lot of people don't  get the implications of codes of honour and just take the disadvantage because of the 15 karma points it gives.   Really, I would not even mind somebody having taken an allergy, that won't come into play first. Rare allergies give less points, so even if it is something discribed as common, just tell him, you will threat it as a rare desease. We did the same for other allergies, so, yeah...  I kinda get the feeling, that the guy really plays more in the ""I am a freaking god"" mode, that works well with pink mohawk, but less well in nightshade. Believe me, I know the problem, as our group is basicly split in the middle between people believing themselves to be gods and people, who actually think before they act. Not to mention that one of our players actually took a heavy alcohol addiction and never told any of the GMs about it, so that we basicly ignored it, before I got his character sheet and was like ""wait a moment. Your character should be drunk all the time."" - ""Well, yeah, he is."" - ""You do know, that being drunk will mess with your reaction time, right?"" - ""No, I have a high alcohol resistence."" - ""Which gives you additional dices and does not make you completely immune."" Ever since he went from being a great car driver to a mediocre one...   But yeah, you really should talk to that player and try to have him understand, what the implications of a code of honour are and that it is actually a disadvantage, that should not be only standing on a piece of paper, but that should be role played."

Shadowrun,3cabfi,War_Wrecker,2,Tue Jul 7 03:05:34 2015 UTC,"As a gm its well within your rights to rule that he loses the quality because of how he's acting (along with the extra karma, as such he'll need to make it up later before he can spend karma on anything else)  Another option is composure tests: this character should feel conflicted about his code of honor being violated and need to roll every time to succeed in these actions (if that player finds this to be BS then explain he should have taken a different quality that doesn't interfere with his desire to kill)  The seafood allergy is not too bad, a lot of meat products incorporate krill instead of soy, so you should be able to include it somewhere!  I think his character wouldn't keep working with the other players (most likely they flat out refuse to work with a guy who screws them over by taking contracts without them then running off and screwing up by himself), requiring him to completely remake his character. This would avoid his issues of previous activities carrying over (which they should but if he doesn't want that then its his choice) whilst also letting you just say no to the assassin's creed quality.  Finally it sounds like you tried to make a great character, but not the one he wanted to play, a chat between gm and player is needed to work out his character aims and if he's the right fit for your campaign"
Shadowrun,3cabfi,Philinhere,2,Mon Jul 6 12:12:22 2015 UTC,"When I get a player like this, I just set them loose on the city and bring popcorn to watch the show.  All you need to do is relax, and let the mess sort itself out. Sometimes, other players will reign them in, sell them out or kill them off. Other times, the player gets into so much trouble on their own, that none of that is necessary. You just portray the city's realistic reaction to the antics. A bomb threat? A shootout? An actual terrorist spotted in the city? How much heat can the guy bring down on the team, and how many team members will survive it?  Think of it this way. Every person the player kills has friends. Especially the police. Cop killers rarely make it to the court house.  So all you have to do is portray the world to be the team's sandbox. You can build castles or destroy them, and everything will have a realistic consequence. If you play your cards right, the other players will shame, shun or bully him into chilling the hell out.  Or the campaign will end in a glorious fireball and everyone gets to make new characters, again. Grumbling at that guy the whole time."

If it's #1, you ought to help him, or at least stop him and tell him before he does ridiculous things.  If it's #2, give the guy an ultimatum, he learns the rules or he stops playing.  Because seriously who is looking for paperwork in a SR setting?  That's not ""funny"" that's someone who clearly has very little knowledge of the setting and laugh as much as you want, if he doesn't get that, you guys should at least point it out to him, not laugh, otherwise you guys are just standing by and watching him do completely out of character things that /he/ does not know are out of character simply because it amuses you, and then having the gall to call him out on doing out of character stuff well after he does it."

Every time I've made a character for someone else they have ignored/misunderstood rules/abilities, have played poorly, and have been generally disconnected from their character.  Never make a character for someone else. And if they have the wherewithal to be swapping qualities, etc. then they can make their own character from the start."

For some people, Shadowrun means scraping by on the streets, getting addicted to drugs and screwed by their Johnsons.  When I started this campaign, I told them up front that it wouldn't be that way. They were already an established Oceans 11 style team with multiple safehouses and fake SINs, and they got pulled into a behind the scenes power struggle between the elves and dragons.  Now that they're retired, the new team is much more street level. In part because they're being hired by the old team, who are tightwads with their nuyen. (Negotiation rolls are hilarious.)"

Shadowrun,3c8kgs,dezzmont,7,Mon Jul 6 01:20:07 2015 UTC,"Of course it is ethical.  You probably want to focus more on being fun though, I wouldn't recommend unethically murdering a player or anything for fun!  The real issue is making sure the canon NPCs don't overshadow the PCs. While the NPC runners seem like larger than life figures, with few exceptions most of them are about on par with a out of gen PC runner, or one with a moderate amount of karma under their belt, meaning that this shouldn't be too huge an issue. A PC team is a near legendary collection of runners after a few runs, and out of the gate they are inarguably extremely talented runners who have the potential to shake the power structure of the setting. As long as you avoid stat infalting the NPCs you can easily use them to add a lot of flavor to the setting and use them to give PCs ins to groups and information that make them understand how they are radically stronger and more important than most other runners, who generally are thugs with a piece of 'ware and a crappy gun.  Have the canon NPCs show up to offer aid to the runners without being a full deus ex machina, such as offering information or a vital piece of gear that is out of the runner team's role. Have them subcontract the team for a huuuuge job that they have no hope of doing on their own. Get one of them to ask a PC who has a particularly unique focus in their skills to write a short snippet for Jackpoint. Have Aljernoon suddenly show up for no explainable reason and charge 3 times as much for reagents in a spot where the PCs can't normally get them.  And don't be afraid to let the PCs be very very rough to the setting. Shadowrun is not a game where the Setting should look the same after the PCs hit it. Remember that, in canon, a PC group stopped a horror invasion and another got to directly chose the next loremaster. Nothing is sacred, even if changing it shouldn't be easy, especially after PCs finish quite a few runs."

You might want to have a look at the 4th edition street legends supplement. A lot of those famous characters are statted out in there and they are way beyond characters fresh out of chargen.  You make it sound like the PCs are the only people who really advance and if that's the game at your table that's cool. But the setting suggests otherwise.  The PCs should be the spotlight, but even the Corebook suggests that prime runners be build with equal to double the PCs Karma."
Shadowrun,3c8kgs,dezzmont,2,Mon Jul 6 06:27:11 2015 UTC,"You might want to have a look at the 4th edition street legends supplement. A lot of those famous characters are statted out in there and they are way beyond characters fresh out of chargen.   I actually read street legends. An optimized PC matches or surpasses many of the more powerful characters from street legends.  Mages of course have a harder time of it, because they of course have the initiation gate, but none of the street legends are astoundingly hard to catch up to save the extra special ones such as Frosty. Elijah, a mage with enough mastery over the secrets of the world to impres Man-Of-Many-Names, is only a third grade initiate, which while not something you can technically start as also doesn't make him stronger than any given hermetic college professor. Not exactly something that PCs can never aspire to be, and definitely something starting PCs are about on the level of.  Kane, who is depicted as an unstoppable badass and the scourge of the Caribean, who regularly distrupts any operation going on there nearly single handedly, and who often is pointed to as proof positive of Jackpointers all being unstoppable stat heavy monsters, is actually about on par or even weaker character compared to a starting samurai PC from 4e. Most of the legends are likewise, generally less optimized than a PC, not actually spiking harder in power than any of them, and mostly spending karma and nuyen on spreading out rather than actually becoming strong. Then you get to the real street legends, the guys who everyone looks up to, like Bull. While well out of character gen, they aren't on some mystical level out of reach of people who just genned. They have a slightly broader skill set and better equipment, but they aren't made of NPCanium. Bull could easily lose a matrix fight against a starting PC, and that says a lot about the level PCs start at.   You make it sound like the PCs are the only people who really advance and if that's the game at your table that's cool. But the setting suggests otherwise.   The setting suggests that powerful shadowrunners advance the setting. PCs are powerful shadowrunners, and thus part of the collective actually changing things rather than just robbing poorly guarded offices like the street level toughs. Shadowrun is not a setting in stasis.   The PCs should be the spotlight, but even the Corebook suggests that prime runners be build with equal to double the PCs Karma.   Couple problems with this. In 4e, which you seem to be basing this off of, double karma really doesn't affect anyone's power that much save a mage, who does get moderately more powerful based on karma, but until the PCs are sitting on hundreds of karma it is not actually that significant a power advancement. Having 80 karma vs 40 karma isn't even a boost to magic, it is having a skill or two higher than a PC and an extra initiation.  5e makes it a little better, in the sense it makes having a karma lead on the PCs matter for non-mages as well, but it still isn't a big lead. Having 20, 40, or 80 more karma than your target is not actually going to make or break anything stat wise."
Shadowrun,3c8kgs,Beaumis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:30:09 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I read street legends, but NPCs like Serin Shamadar or Anne Ravenheart and such are really really powerful individuals that would take a lot of karma to emulate in their core areas.  I was basing it of 5th though. There's just no street legends equivalent. I think the key thing to keep in mind here is that char gen characters can surpass the legends in singular things relatively easily, such as shooting a gun, those characters usually pay for that with being very specialized. The legends aren't just legends because they are good at something. They are legends because they lived to tell the tale. Some do have plot armor though.  You are absolutely right that PCs should change things. I was merely suggesting they shouldn't be the only ones to do so. I also found it to be healthy for the setting if the PCs aren't actually the biggest movers and shakers out there, but that may be preference."

No dragon is as deadly as a well placed sniper team. You might have a lot of friends or awesome cyberware or an invincibility complex, but you still bleed. To date, this approach has not changed how players react to events and people; facing someone important makes them realize their own mortality, and it works.  Case in point: they ruined the reputation of a politician who was running for mayor's office, by exposing that he is, in fact, a vampire who hosts regular feeding orgies at his mansion. Now wanted for one count of murder and decidedly out of office, the vampire tracks down the team's sniper to the team's hideout, having assensed that guy before. When the team is all gathered there, he drives up in a limo, and knocks on their front door, asking for a parlay. He appears to be by himself, but their drone reports seven other heat signatures in the junkyard outside, that looks like another runner team taking position for an ambush.  Given these circumstances, they let the vampire inside the house.  The guy nonchalantly demands to know who their employer is, and is willing to pay for the information. The runners negotiate a price and comply. The vampire thanks them and leaves.  Granted, they did not know who their employer was, but they had a recording and some clues. It was enough to satisfy his curiosity.  Could they have messed with him? Absolutely. They chose not to. It's their call. Players love to have agency. :)"

If someone does track the dirty deed back to you, you done messed up son! You can deny everything to high heaven and back, but it's best if it doesn't come to that.  If you want them to not talk to anyone about what they did for you, you have options:   silence them, hiring another team to wipe them out instead of paying them. pay them off to keep their mouths shut, specifically insist on this; you could go so far as giving them a plausible lie to tell anyone who inquires, then offer to pay extra to report back if someone does. cover your tracks well; work through a fixer instead of directly, fabricate an alternative identity that interacts with them. There is a reason why every employer is called Mr. Johnson, after all.   In this case, the Johnson worked with them directly, but was disguised with an illusion spell; which sadly did not cover the atrocious body odor. They passed the info and footage of the illusion to the vampire, who seemed satisfied.  Would this screw up their reliability? Maybe a little. If they had a little more ""honor"" they might have told the vampire off and had a nice little fire fight to settle their differences. But then again, the Johnson never asked them to keep their mouths shut.   Contracts which involve criminal acts are woefully unenforceable.  If the vampire moves quickly enough, there won't be a Johnson left to ruin the runners' reputations."

Should I be rolling my poor Sneaking pool trying to follow them in the vents, or managing flyspys around the area, or what?""

What should I do if the job involves (borrowed from Blades in the Dark):   assault, including violence to a target deception, including luring, tricking, or manipulating infiltration, including trespassing unseen where we are not wanted magic, including confronting or exploiting a supernatural power social, including negotiating, bargaining, or persuading transport, including moving something or intercepting somethnig being moved  What is my responsibility if combat breaks out expectedly? Unexpectedly? If I can help fight or help complete an objective, which is more valuable? When does that change? What are useful secondary roles that match my expected attribute line?

Cover Your Hoop  We're not always running. You'll need to present a normal life most of the time unless you're okay living out in the Barrens. SINs are what you need to just step into the normal world. Don't have one, well you don't technically exist chummer. Starting out with a Rating 4 SIN is good enough, add some licenses for driving, maybe some obvious equipment, and hell even a license that helps you get around. Mages you can get an Private Astral Investigator's license that'll let you snoop around in daylight. Sams, a bodyguard's license will open up doors for you. Riggers work great as Private Couriers, delivering packages and whatnot.  Hell, some of them can even pay.  Covering your hoop also means doing the basics of forensic security. Don't use the same guns in your runs as you would out in the daylight if you're carrying (with a license). Don't use the same vehicles. The same clothes. Anything that can easily be tracked can be. Paranoid? Maybe. You know what they say about paranoia right?  You'll also need a bolthole, a safe place that only you know about. You'll need food, water, and medicine--a medkit will do.

Shadowrun,3c94iz,D_Keller,4,Mon Jul 6 01:48:43 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate, scorched earth works pretty well. You kill the entire gang off, there isn't anyone to come back at you. This can be tricky, however, if the gang is too large to get all in one go. A few rocket launchers at a clubhouse during a gang meeting is a good way to deal with a biker gang, for instance, but gunning down a few of the Ancients' street corners is a good way to do little damage and get a big contract on your head.  Gangs are hard to trust, and they're mostly in it for fun or for a bottom line.

Are you cleaning up a neighbourhood, backing one player to become more powerful, or just having some ""fun""? Remember, it's good to have friends in low places. Gangers know the streets, see the effects of actions firsthand even if they don't understand the what and why. It's always useful to have them in your debt, but it'll cost you.   The gang you support certainly has rivals, and those rivals may have backers of their own. They may have been buffering your gang from a larger gang/threat as well.

Shadowrun,3c94iz,Allarionn,3,Wed Jul 15 21:22:58 2015 UTC,"Vet Answer: Generally speaking it is best to go non-lethal when you are dealing with any sort of hostile interaction with a group. If you kill off their members then that gives them incentive to hunt you down and pay you back when they have the numerical advantage. If you knock them out and leave them alive that is saying, ""I could have killed you, but I let you live. Let's call it 'just doing business' and not make this personal.'""  If an enemy is hitting you with lethal rounds you do not need to return it in kind. My general rule is I don't go lethal unless someone is firing APDS at me. Normal bullets usually work out to be stun damage in Shadowrun anyhow.  Re: Follow-up: That is throwing your lot in with a faction, you should think long and hard of the association you make. Their actions will reflect on you, and their enemies will become your own."
Shadowrun,3c94iz,Zemalac,4,Mon Jul 6 03:33:12 2015 UTC,"So much this.   Keep it non-lethal kiddies. If you really need to kill them, you can always coup coup d'état them after the fact, but if you kill them first you cannot leave them alive. Non-lethal gives you options, it makes you less enemies, and it shows you are an actual professional.  Only exception is when they job specifically is wetwork, or when fighting spirits. APDS can save your hoop vs spirits."
Shadowrun,3c94iz,ozurr,3,Mon Jul 6 03:45:58 2015 UTC,"No looting   I keep seeing this come up on the sub. Is this a common rule for Shadowrun games? Because I've never played in or run a game where looting was banned, or even discouraged. It seems like if you're playing a criminal trying to scrape by as part of an underclass that the rest of the world is actively malevolent towards, you should be invested in shaking every last nuyen you can get out of any situation you get into.  I mean, obviously you're not going to get very far if you're stupid about it. Everything's tagged, everything's traceable. But, to take an example from my last session, if my players are willing to invest the time in carefully tag-erasing every weapon and bullet in the arms shipment they stole from a police sting during the previous run, and then negotiate a weapons sale to vampires while Knight Errant is tearing the city apart looking for them, then more power to them."
Shadowrun,3c94iz,gimlettio,4,Mon Jul 6 14:46:09 2015 UTC,"Looting tends to be a D&D subset, and the way many of those parties financed their adventures.  SR exists in a world where anything can be tracked, and because of it resold stuff tends to lose a lot of value fast.  The fencing rules through contacts show this.  Is it worth picking up every last Ares Predator from the gangers your team just wasted, utilizing precious escape moments for ¥40 a pop?  Or the corpsec SMG's that are providing realtime information to the company you just infiltrated?  There's a tradeoff between looting and bringing down the heat.  In a world where your assault rifle is broadcasting your ammo count and K:D ratio to the rest of your team, snagging someone else's to sell to Iron Mickey at 6th and Spring is going to expose your movements to people you don't want knowing.  If the looting is the payday to your run, more power to you.  Hijacking an arms shipment to get paid is a legitimate job if you're willing to shoulder the risks.  So is jacking a bunch of high-end cars, moving drugs, or whatever criminals are wont to do in the Sixth World.  If it's attached to a ""legitimate"" job you're already doing, you risk blowing the op for the cost of a round of beers at the bar."
Shadowrun,3c94iz,Zemalac,5,Mon Jul 6 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"Part of it is meta - A major factor is the multi-GM no-fixed-team-of-runners structure of ""living campaigns"" like the ones here.  That makes it REALLY tough to  keep runs ""fair"" for all players.  Should 3 or 4 players suddenly get a massive power increase because 1 GM slipped up and left a exploitable hole in 1 run he ran?    Then even if the GMs agreed to try to fix it, how would you do that exactly without hard feelings all around?   If you try to fix it in-game, now you need private runs just to set things right because if you bring down heat on 1 player in a different run with a different team, why should they suffer because Sammy Sam got grabby on some unrelated run?  Or an even darker possibility - somebody hands out extra loot to his friends when he's GMing, how would you feel in those runs when somebody else is getting showered with free stuff?   Or to look at it from another angle, even if it was totally random and unbiased, how could a GM defend himself from accusations that it was a setup?  What other alternative is there?  Force every GM to go over every possible loophole in his runs with a fine tooth comb to try to eliminate possibilities?   I think ""no looting"" is a reasonable pre-emptive solution vs forcing every GM to do a lot of extra work, and players from trying all kinds of hijinks to grab some extra shiny.  In a long running campaign, with 1 or at least ""few"" GMs, with everyone at the table agreeing at  least to the general outlines of the story and the game mode, it's possible to use looting to have some fun/advance the story/get resources for plot/whatever."
Shadowrun,3c94iz,gimlettio,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see why the rule is enforced in living campaigns, and I'm not arguing about that (though it is one of the big reasons I haven't joined any of the living games myself), but it keeps coming up in reference to home games too. Which seems weird to me, because no matter how many times people try to lay on the same old ""You're supposed to be a professional"" line, you're still playing criminals. Carefully-planned heists are grand fun, and I'll never stop playing or running them, but I've always thought that opportunistic crime should also part of the game. The world's given you nothing, so you reach out and squeeze it until it bleeds nuyen for you, that sort of thing."
Shadowrun,3c94iz,Zemalac,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:43:10 2015 UTC,"IMO it's kind of a waste of time if you spend valuable game time every session repeatedly going ""I search every room for stuff to steal what do I find?"" ""I go search the bodies what do I find?"", ""I put them carefully into my RF-blocking bag"", ""I scan everything for tags"", ""I roll to remove tags"", ""I roll to remove tags again"",  ""now I call my fence contacts"", negotiate for prices, add up one by one the few hundred nuYen you're getting from all this tedium, bleh.   Plus it's that much more risk, tying that many more people including valuable contacts into handling and passing on evidence connected with your activities, I'd especially rather not deal with the fallout from that for chump change.  Once in a while it's fun to get a bigger payout, like when you're making a bit of decent money anyhow and everybody is ready to move up a notch.  Sure everybody dreams of finding a truck full of cyberdecks or something, but is that really fun?   ""OK you get 40 million each from fencing the decks, you can each buy 10 jets, 10 of every other vehicle, weapon and piece of gear and permanent luxury lifestyle.  Congratulations you win shadowrun.""   Although I'd probably let a rigger steal a reasonable amount of drones as replacements, the rules are just fucking heartless to those poor bastards and their tissue paper machines :D  But if you guys can agree on creative ways to incorporate just the right amount into the game where you're all having fun, hey don't let me tell you it's badwrong..."
Shadowrun,3c94iz,McBoobenstein,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:48:05 2015 UTC,"You're kind of looking at opposite extremes, here. No one is going to be looting random ganger or corpsec bodies for their weapons and commlinks, unless they're Red Samurai or something and that gear might actually be worth a bit. Similarly, finding a truck of cyberdecks is, as you said, game-ending stuff. Neither of those is what I usually see in Shadowrun (or D&D, or any other game, for that matter).  But some ganger is using an attack dongle on his 'link to try and hack you? That's worth a couple thousand, even at fence prices. That's worth the effort to pick up. Or the mansion you've broken into, that's got some nice art on display, stuff that isn't RFID tagged because they're antiques and implanting even a tiny chip like that might damage them. Might be worth wrapping a statue in padding and taking it with you, or rolling up a painting, if you've got a moment and everything else is going smoothly. Or if you've just gassed the response team's mobile HQ van, and their drone rigger has a nice RCC, pick that up and take the time to strip out the tracking tags, that's a couple grand right there. Things like that.  I'm not saying be stupid about it. But if the players are paying attention to the opportunities that get thrown their way, I don't see it as unreasonable for a couple hundred or a couple thousand nuyen to make its way into their pockets, if they're willing to take the time and deal with the danger of it."

At first we played a version of 2/3 that was houseruled into infinity and honestly, I didn't understand anything. Early last Year we switched to 5E and since then I am happy.  What I found often to be the case, and what happened to me at first: I got the right skill, but not the stuff to do it. (i.e. I'm awesome at Lockpicking, but do not own a Lockpick - Or the Character wants to be an Infiltration Master / Assassin / Spy - whatever, but didn't buy silencers or has any means of silently silence someone - Or the first Street-Sam I built for 5E had 7+1W6 Initiative, which became a problem rather quick.) The result was always a heavily frustrated Newbie and a complete overhaul of the character sheet afterwards.  And perhaps stuff that is important in every RPG like: Why should I never, ever, ever, ever start attacking my own Team members, even if I feel they may deserve it? (Our mage casted a Mind Manipulation spell on our face just a couple of weeks ago - boy was that a drama !)  And the importance of your characters personality. If you hate all of metahumanity, love to torture kittens and refuse to give anyone your Name (even Streetname) because so many Action-Film badasses did the same before you, it will be extremely difficult to make your character part of a team."

The books, in my opinion, doesn't really cover what the limits of astral projection is.

Shadowrun,3c8t85,marcus_gideon,2,Mon Jul 6 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"Core pg 219, PANs  Most individuals have multiple electronic devices on them at once, and having icons for each one show up would provide too much visual clutter in the Matrix. Often, what shows up instead is an icon representing an individual’s personal area network. This icon often looks similar to the physical device that serves as master for the network, such as a commlink, but individuals will sometimes choose a design or logo that means something to them (such as sports team logos, Concrete Dreams album covers, or corporate designs). Some devices are not merged into the single PAN icon; if an individual is carrying a wireless-enabled gun—or any other wireless device that might kill you—it will show up separately so that it can be identified rapidly. Unless, of course, the user has gone to the trouble to hide that icon, but that’ll be covered later.   As the others have said, the default behavior for Iconograpy is to lump all of their Icons into one, that way you aren't surrounded by a churning mass of jackets, underwear, shoes, wristwatches, pacemakers, headphones, commlinks... However, if you choose to look for those things you certainly can. At which point (like Pink said) anything within 100 meters that isn't Running Silent will be visible. Anything further away, or Hidden, will require a roll."
Shadowrun,3c8t85,Feynt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"What it also mentions is some iconography has a default setting of being shown, like guns.  With a decker in the group I allow them to make a Hide action to obscure the device in question from the matrix (even though it's supposed to be for the individual, not the devices).  I also allow for long term tinkering tests to change the default iconography to make it fit in like a wrist watch would in the PAN, not showing by default.  Too bad almost nobody asks me about these things.  I'm sure the guns ahoy street sammy would like to know he could get the decker to hide his wirelessly enabled guns."
Shadowrun,3c8t85,marcus_gideon,2,Mon Jul 6 02:38:12 2015 UTC,"You can't exactly ""tinker"" with the Icon of a gun, and make it blend into the PAN. However, you can use Wrapper to make it into a wristwatch, which would then blend in.  If anybody wants their gun to be invisible, they can either turn off the wireless functions, or set it to Silent Running. However, if they do so and someone makes a check specifically for Hidden Icons, not only will it stick out like a sore thumb, but they'll get twice the tickets. Carrying a firearm, and concealing said firearm."
Shadowrun,3c8t85,Feynt,2,Mon Jul 6 02:52:30 2015 UTC,"The tinkering check I allow is an hour period extended check to futz with the firmware and make it think it's a wrist watch (that conveniently has smartlink access and a clip), or whatever else.  Since the tinkerer isn't a decker, a glitch may introduce...  Shall we say, unfortunate side effects?  Life is more interesting when your gun may instead broadcast as a car you're carrying around with you, or may IFF only on friendlies instead of enemies.  >D"
Shadowrun,3c8t85,marcus_gideon,2,Mon Jul 6 04:17:45 2015 UTC,"Umm... I would think installing completely foreign firmware into a device isn't going to make your Smartgun think it's a wristwatch. It's going to brick the Gun and make it completely useless. That's why Deckers use Wrapper to conceal the Iconography.  Especially since the tinkerer isn't a Decker, I'd say you're far more likely to destroy the weapon than you are to convince it to be a bullet flinging toaster."
Shadowrun,3c8t85,Feynt,2,Mon Jul 6 14:41:29 2015 UTC,"It's not completely foreign, it's still the gun, but the tinkering check is basically attempting to remove the safe guard protocol that enforces displaying the gun.  Basically the equivalent of the decker's (relatively very quick) actions to trick the matrix into displaying something else, but it takes an hour or two to properly do the changes at a work bench (hopefully)."
Shadowrun,3c8t85,marcus_gideon,2,Mon Jul 6 15:15:58 2015 UTC,"Still sounds like a very convoluted way of getting around just Running Silent.  It's not so much that the gun advertises itself separately; every item does. But the typical AR filters are set to lump most regular items together into a single PAN. That way you don't see every little bit of tech on their body. But the filters are set to specifically call out dangerous things like weapons. So if the gun identifies itself as a gun at all, then it will be more readily visible. And changing the firmware to make it a toaster, is just going to render the gun useless.   Anybody can set the gun to Silent Running, which prevents the gun from advertising anything. This is the easiest way to keep from being noticed... unless somebody is looking specifically for Hidden Icons, and narrows it down to your gun. Or if you really want to ""tinker"" with it, then get a Decker to use Wrapper. But I wouldn't just let any random Joe mess with the programming of a Smartgun."
Shadowrun,3c8t85,PinkTrench,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yes.  You can see the Icon for every device running within one hundred meters of you that isn't running silent. In practice your commlink groups them together unless you focus on them, and filters out most of the ones it thinks you won't care about.  If you want to spot someone's PAN running silent, you need to beat it's Logic(+Sleaze if it's a deck/Host or slaved to one) with Matrix Perception."

Shadowrun,3c8t85,fendokencer,2,Mon Jul 6 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on a couple of things I think. How much coverage/noise there is so you can actually see the icons and if they are broadcasting or you have the ability to spot them if they are running silent.  If you can see them, you would see their comlink's icon that their gun is slaved to.  I think you can pick out specific icons like 'weapon' but you may have to do a search/matrix perception test for those if there is a lot of noise."
Shadowrun,3c8t85,marcus_gideon,2,Mon Jul 6 16:03:46 2015 UTC,Kinda depends on the GM's interpretation. Some would let you automatically see those things within line of sight. Others would make you use Trace Icon since that's specifically for comparing an Icon to the physical location.
Shadowrun,3c8t85,digitalpacman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"PAN's don't ""hide"" what's in them, just groups them. So you might at first see an icon for the PAN, then you can expand it to see everything on that PAN. Or you can turn the filter off and never see PAN icons."

Shadowrun,3c8k63,Trickybiz,3,Mon Jul 6 02:53:35 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the hell out of this novella. It was well worth my money. I'm interested to see where Kincaid goes in the novel that should be coming out in the near future.

Shadowrun,3c8k63,Modernpreacher,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:32:58 2015 UTC,I read the little insert that came with Crossfire and it seemed like Fire and Frost (at least what I read of it) was well written.  Did it have a dumb plot or something?
Shadowrun,3c8k63,Modernpreacher,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:37:35 2015 UTC,"I've read Fire and Frost, and I really enjoyed the first half. The stuff in Seattle and Chicago were really fun. But then once the characters hit Brazil things started to become more noticeably gamy. It felt like things would be happening to the characters just so they'd have something to do. Which makes some sense, you don't want to read about a 12 hours drive where nothing happens. But the things that were happening didn't make sense, and just felt like things happening to the characters so that something would happen to them.  Also, the pay off at the end was a bit lackluster and felt rushed."

Shadowrun,3c8k63,TheSmilingBandit,2,Mon Jul 6 13:57:16 2015 UTC,"I had mixed feelings with it. Partially because I think 2XS is the best Shadowrun book ever written, and Nigel Findley was a beast when it came to the Shadowrun narrative.  Zimmerman's writing wasn't on the same level, but I wasn't expecting it to be either. Problem was the whole private eye thing was too much like Dirk sometimes. So I couldn't help but draw connections, and when held up against 2XS... it's just ok.  It's still a really good read though. Easily the better of the newer releases so far. Some of the writing felt a little cheesy at times at the start, almost cringe worthy... but it seemed like it worked itself out quite quickly and was a fast enjoyable read.  I'd suggest anyone who likes Shadowrun read it. Especially at the price of 4 bucks or whatever it was."

Doc Wagon 19: I enjoyed it a lot.  Some rough spots, but a good read.    Borrowed Time:  Need to sit down and read it.    Crimson:  Vampire Shadowrunner trying to save the world, or at least his part of it.  Just a fair read. Hell On Water:Tried to get through the book, but the style of the writing made it impossible for me.  Felt very disjointed.  A group of runners trying to get across a bridge."

So the author used a very African-style narrative which, while I can appreciate he writing style, I just didn't care for. He ending was also very ""oh shit, I need to finish huzzah it's over"".

When we're reading the comments by characters (Frosty, Bull, etc.) are those written by the writer of the piece, or are there people who ""own"" those characters and write them (e.g., Mr Zimmerman always writes for Bull the Ork decker)?  Also, you should have a Facebook page where we can follow you! Once I saw you commenting on an SR podcast page, so I went to your page to follow you to see what you are working on, but it's not set up that way! You owe it to your fans!

That stuff's always done by the writer of the piece, but when we can we collaborate, also, so Bull (the real-life guy) can maybe take a look at what you've got Bull (the Ork decker) saying, and can grouch at you for it or give you a high five, depending on his mood.  There are still tendencies for some of us to use certain characters more than others (given how often I've written about spies and/or the Tir, for instance, I use Agent Thorn more than most)...but it's nothing official.  They're all up for grabs, for everyone to ""post"" with.  And I do have a Facebook page, and folks are welcome to follow me, it's just that it's using my secret code name instead of the name I write under, and you'll never guess it, muwahahahahaha!  Okay, it's ""Rusty Zimmerman"" instead of ""Russell,"" that's all.

Shadowrun,3c7sq9,OLStefan,9,Sun Jul 5 18:24:31 2015 UTC,"An AI would need a SIN to make purchases online,  to legitimately use Matrix sites that ask for ID, and also to act as a cover. There is a lot of fear and prejudice over AIs,  so just announcing what you are isn't a great idea. Pretending you are a decker or rigger that prefers to work remotely is a safer move."
Shadowrun,3c7sq9,heimdahl81,2,Sun Jul 5 18:38:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, now that I read it, it seems pretty obvious."
Shadowrun,3c7sq9,marcus_gideon,3,Sun Jul 5 18:52:05 2015 UTC,"1) Artificial Intelligence are basically recognized as a living being, compared to an Agent program or something. So they need a SIN just as much as any other citizen would. If they don't have one, they can't do anything ""legally"". And even if it's only a fake SIN, they still want to look legal sometimes.  2) For one thing, the book layout sucks (as always), but the Advanced Programs are listed from pg 158 onwards. Abduction, Authority, Cascade... these are the Advanced Programs. All of the ""regular"" programs would be the usual hacker stuff listed on Core pg 245-246.  However, DT pg 156 says AI can only use Autosofts if they purchased the Pilot Origins quality (pg 150). Otherwise they just use active skills like any character would operating a drone.  As for Agents, those are a separate entity entirely. That would be like your AI carrying around a little Mini-Me. Since the Agent takes up separate space in the Cyberdeck, and manifests its own Persona, I think an AI would have to purchase those normally, if they would at all.  So the way I'm seeing that... only AI that evolved from Pilot programs can use Autosofts. And AI probably wouldn't create Agents since that's like giving birth to an inferior copy."
Shadowrun,3c7sq9,marcus_gideon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:06:01 2015 UTC,"I know the retriction of use of autosofts. In my case i want to play a Pilot Origins AI, so that point is covered. I still have no idea how autosoft purchase is handled.  My idea is just like cyberprograms, but so it seems strange that anything other then rating 6 autosoft would be a waste of karma (even though 5 karma would be 10k karma for 3k Nuyen Software)."
Shadowrun,3c7sq9,marcus_gideon,2,Sun Jul 5 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"AIs don’t create new technology or programs out of nothing; instead, they utilize what already exists in a more efficient manner. In the case of programs, they are able to optimize and re-write existing software so that it grants them unique bonuses and abilities.   This bit right here would make me think that you need to buy the program / Autosoft first, and then spend the time and Karma to adapt it into something your AI can handle. Even though it does say later on ""they wouldn't buy on the open market"", it doesn't make sense that they can spend a couple days and create the highest rated software from scratch."
Shadowrun,3c7sq9,Ed345678,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:00:53 2015 UTC,"That makes sense and handles the potential waste of karma.

Shadowrun,3c6o2p,felicidefangfan,9,Sun Jul 5 10:07:07 2015 UTC,"Writer error!   I could have sworn it was Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Epsilon, Zeta (and onwards) in teh Greek Alphabet.   Turns out that it's Gamma Delta, so the order's now a tad off. If you wanted to keep th ""-a"" naming convention from Alpha Beta Delta, then Zeta would be next, but English readers would be all grumbly about that since we see Z as the end of the line.   (I'm pretty sure that if I went with Epsilon, then we'd have people grumbling about Gamma missing! Understandable, mind you!)  I doubt that we'll switch Gamma and Delta grades down the line to make it fall into place, but that'd be the proper correction. People used to hearing ""Delta"" as the best of the best, so when Gamma's ready to go, you renamed the current Delta as Gamma, then ""re-introduce"" Delta, and while it makes the engineers and experts wail and gnash their teeth, the public, already trained to think ""Delta = best!"" don't have to worry about learning new stuff.   But, there you go. It was intended to just slide in where it was supposed to, but someone using ""Delta"" as the third letter a while back borked the flow."
Shadowrun,3c6o2p,Wakshaani,6,Sun Jul 5 14:57:00 2015 UTC,"Mathematician here:  I use the greek alphabet pretty regularly, but I couldn't recite it in order.  The one that really surprises me is Omega ware being low-grade stuff. In my area, both upper and lowercase omega always feel very ""important"", because they're both used in representing different ""levels"" of infinity.  Plus, there's the pop culture associations: ""I am the alpha and the omega"", and omega being the end of the alphabet. This is really the first time in any source where I've seen omega representing something low quality.  As for the ""high-end"" grades, alpha, beta, delta, gamma actually kinda makes sense in my particular field. Alpha, beta, and delta are generally just variables in a proof. Capital gamma represents a pretty major milestone in the hierarchy of ordinals.  TL;DR Alpha, beta, delta, gamma kinda makes sense. If you're a proof theorist. I don't know many proof theorists, though."

Shadowrun,3c6o2p,p3ndr4g0n,2,Sun Jul 5 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"Now that does sound cool, and you've got me thinking... what if gamma did come before delta but the data got buried for profit reasons?  One or more AAA were messing around with some new software and nanofabrication processes (or whatever), when they accidental came up with something revolutionary. Some cyber so great that not only did it put current lines of tech to shame, but it might prove to take a very long time (and great expense) to come up with a better model.  So they hatch a plan: bury all the data in secret offline nodes - and use it as an end point. Now instead of selling the new ""gamma"" product, the corp can release several new lines of ""delta"", at reduced R+D cost since most of it is done for them already. Each year (or quarter or month or however fast new tech is unveiled in the 6th world), a ""brand new"" version of a delta ware line is released, each incrementally better than the last but costing very little to come up with.  Eventually they catch up to gamma, but at that point its just the latest in a line of deltas, and hopefully R+D has a new gamma to base the next year's (or decade or whatever significant time period) worth of deltaware off of"
Shadowrun,3c6o2p,p3ndr4g0n,3,Mon Jul 6 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"AND, the corp(s) in question always has the upper hand 'cuz if a competitor comes out with something better than the current line, the guys with the Gamma can always just jump forward a little earlier than expected."

But if you want to use the naming convention for non-standard grades in Greek, you have to pick some letter.  .  Zeta could have worked, really. Buuuuut, Beta and Zeta are soundalike enough that it could cause problems. So, 'Omega' won out.

By building your own lifestyle you basically look for a place that has all the things you want. The armory is a room. 1000¥ cover the extra rent, power etc.  If I were your GM, I'd rule that the 1000¥ are for the extra power bill you pay to ensure those antiques are stored at proper temperatures, have decent lighting, the right oil and such. Antiques need a lot of care.  Just out of curiosity, is it a thing to store guns loaded? That seems strange to me, but I don't own any."
Shadowrun,3c6u64,Beaumis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:12:55 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, that makes a bit more sense now. As for storing them loaded, a lot of real life gun owners do, at least for their home-defense gun, it's illegal in Australia (Where I live) though.   My char (Loki) has them loaded so that they can be used in emergencies, just grab a musket or that old lever-action rifle, even the WW1-era Lewis machine gun off the wall, and shoot the intruder. It's sort of a ""Hiding in plain sight"" disguise, plus they look good.   I think realistically keeping firearms loaded can cause some problems over long periods, but if they're cleaned regularly they should be alright."

I say this b/c some people think they can get a Rating 6 Foci, and use it to support 6x Force 1 spells.  Once you start supporting them yourself, you suffer a cumulative -2 penalty to keep them going. So an inherent limit would be, once you run out of dice to do anything else.  In the Technomancer section, Core pg 251, they suggest a concentration check if ""something"" happens that could potentially break your focus. I usually make the Mages roll the same kind of check, with one of those ""somethings"" being taking damage. So if you were supporting 5 different spells, and you took a hit, you'd roll with a -10 penalty hoping not to get so distracted that you lose them all. So it's better you only Sustain 1-2 spells, that way your concentration pool isn't shrunk down to nothing."

Normally this would also be a ""panic time"" check if it was higher than your Body in my campaigns.  Weak and feable people get touchy about taking gunshots, basically.  More so than ""omg, I took 7 damage of 9 points in one shot!"" from the player, the character who fails a composure(4-boxes remaining) test suffers a -2 die penalty to do anything that doesn't involve running away or fixing themselves up.

Since they have an unlimited number of services, the summoner can task them to do all sorts of things without worry.  However, since the Ally Spirit is basically a Bound Spirit with an unlimited number of services, it still uses the same rules as a Bound Spirit for those tasks.   Core pg 302  Spell sustaining: You can have a spirit sustain a spell for you after you cast it. It takes the –2 dice pool penalty per sustained spell, instead of you. It can’t do this forever— only for its Force in Combat Turns for each service you spend on spell sustaining.   So not only could you go by the ""until they run out of dice"" idea, but remember that they won't be sustaining that X number of spells all day long. (Force) Combat Turns means a Force 6 Spirit will sustain a spell for 18 seconds."

As GM I would enforce a ""Oh you critical glitched!  How unfortunate.

Most actors (and I am speaking here as a card-carrying professional actor) I know of have skill sets that help to bridge gaps between acting gigs. Do they freelance in the corporate world? If so they probably have a lot of good corporate etiquette skills. Do they work a contract based blue-collar job occasionally? Maybe as a tech repairman (useful for re-wiring keypad locks, etc.)? Or do they have a drug habit that puts them in touch with some real shady characters?  The ""just an actor"" model is kind of impossible unless you are born into money.

If you have a good rep at your table I suspect most people would trust you to RP a character acting against your own interests.  Or go full houserule and make a free spirit working with your entire table. Make sure to only do this if the party is mostly non-awakened, and avoid taking powers that replace other PCs a bit too easily, such as guidance or concealment, which can blow through mysteries and sneaking segments if you have infinite access to them.

By RAW, the best cyberware scanner in the world is rating 6, which means he rolls 6 dice to detect your 'ware. The highest portable cyberware scanner rating is 3 by the sensor rules. Detecting a betaware deck requires 3 hits, a deltaware one 5+. That means most of the time, the scanner won't even find the deck if its a good one. (You only multiply the 5.000 base cost by the grade according to the mission's FAQ, so it's cheap too.) Cyberware can be detected via magic. While mages can have more dice (Assensing + Intuition) they need 4+ hits to detect betaware and they only know the presence and location of a piece of 'ware, not its type. My group has houseruled that you don't actually implant a cyberdeck (or a commlink). Instead, you implant an access port similar to a datajack and a small storage compartment. A miniature cyberdeck that is specifically sold for this purpose is then placed inside the compartment and connected to your brain via the access port. It just seems more sensible for the corps to make decks easily replace- and removable rather than having to have major brain surgery every time you want to upgrade your top scientists' hardware. I recommend using that houser rule."
Shadowrun,3c27qu,Beaumis,6,Sat Jul 4 06:27:42 2015 UTC,The house rule makes a lot of sense. It seems crazy to have to go under to replace a burntout component or do an upgrade
Shadowrun,3c27qu,FallenSeraph75,3,Sat Jul 4 08:08:11 2015 UTC,"Little correction on 1.  Remember, when devices are in use, they roll twice their rating, so, they would roll 12 DP against your cyberware.  It can get pretty hectic out there people."
Shadowrun,3c27qu,Beaumis,0,Sat Jul 4 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"In general, you are correct. However, the rules on P. 362 specifically say the device rolls it's rating. It's likely an oversight, but still RAW.  I never understood how exactly to read that table because the text suggests you roll once per piece of 'ware, but the table suggests you roll once and the threshold rises if you have more 'ware. Hence I decided to go with the text over the table."
Shadowrun,3c27qu,FallenSeraph75,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:14:51 2015 UTC,"If that is the case, then a handheld verses a decked out cyber same would still need to be careful.  If they have 6 items of cyber on them, it gives them a + 3 for the rolls.  While statically not likely to get a 3 6 dice, it appears a rather high chance of getting that amount of success.  Next question, would the mms be monitored.  Because it acts like a sensor, a rigger or spider type security personal can use their EWAR as the method for perceiving the sensor and that can get you, too."
Shadowrun,3c27qu,NotB0b,6,Sun Jul 5 17:30:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is a little bit. Never get a deck in your head for a few reasons:   Impossible to jack you out manually Shows up in cyberware scanners If you need to fix it, you need surgery   Instead, just buy a skin pocket and put it where the sun don't shine."
Shadowrun,3c27qu,felicidefangfan,9,Sat Jul 4 02:46:03 2015 UTC,"Its more a houserule, but for fixing it I often rule there's an access port (similar to the skin flap and usb port universal connector in a datajack).

Lets not be silly about it and make out like the next step is smashing decks to bits. It isn't. What does link-locking say?   If you’re link-locked, you can’t use the Switch Interface Mode, the Enter/Exit Host, or the Reboot actions on the device your persona is using (probably your deck).   Link-locking is like holding your finger over a light switch. When someone cuts the power lines (switching off the power, cutting the cable, or jamming the signal), the light goes out. No need to smash the light bulb."

Shadowrun,3c27qu,Hobbes2073,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"The ""Jack out"" matrix action works exactly the same for implanted or not.  You're not pulling a plug, it's wireless anyway. Yes, but a regular deck is still easier to spot.   No you don't.  Nothing anywhere in the book says that.  You're not scooping out bits of grey matter to shove in headware.  It's likely in a housing that is part of your skull and the nanobits make the important connections.  Think any STtNG when they work on Data's Brain.

You have a Mage and a Street Sam? Hire a Decker to watch your gear and help with security (from a GM prespective the players will have to keep the Decker alive and occasionally shoot up some defence systems that couldn't be hacked).  Without a Mage you hire someone to watch the astral and throw a few spells, a heal, an invis, but be sure to hire someone that knows the spells you need.  Basically, if you can work out the kinds of things your players want to do (social, magic, decking, rigging, fighting), then getting them to do that should make for a good game."

As a general rule, you want to avoid combat as much as possible, either by sneaking, conning, or intimidating your way past problems. A key aspect of this is that you, Joe Shadowrunner, are just one person, and maybe you have a team, but Mega Co has a friggin' ARMY at their beck and call and enough money to make your mother sell you out if you trie dto hide at her place. You will pretty much always be the little guy up against much more powerful adversaries, so the way to 'win' is to be smart, hit the edges, and not draw too much attention to yourself.  .

Catch the troll gangers around the corner with an ultrasound sweep and hit 'em with a Stunball preparation. See the patrol drone with your FlySpy and have an ambush ready for its next pass. Spot a dwarf on the next floor in Astral, and cut a hole around him. My trademark is to sit in my teammate's van with my Rotodrone Walter turned off, then once the targets walk by, throw him out the skylight and turn him on in one initiative pass. Instant fire superiority and perfect for backing up a more conventional ambush."

Maybe somebody like EVO would develop a tiny line of shifter adapted geneware, but it's unlikely. If they did develop it,most likely as a sideline to research to improve paracritter guard animals, it would be absurdly expensive due to the tiny market(kinda like the orphan drug phenomenon).  The product line would be further limited by the fact that every different kind of shifter is going to need mostly seperate R and D."
Shadowrun,3c2elw,PinkTrench,3,Sat Jul 4 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really sound like a ""This doesn't work"" argument though, rather a ""I would house rule it"" argument. There is nothing preventing a shifter from purchasing any bioware or cyberware they want, and the same argument could just as easily apply to them. It only becomes an issue when they shift, and the implants don't shift with the rest of them.  EDIT: And for further clarification, would that mean all meta-sapients are also banned from taking genetech based on that logic?"
Shadowrun,3c2elw,Paddywagon123,2,Sat Jul 4 03:58:54 2015 UTC,Metasapients aren't actively hunted and studied.
Shadowrun,3c2elw,Paddywagon123,2,Sat Jul 4 05:34:31 2015 UTC,"Neither are shifters plenty of places. It doesn't change the fact that either there is no market for meta-sapient genetech, or their is.

Shadowrun,3c2elw,Paddywagon123,3,Sat Jul 4 06:08:56 2015 UTC,"So you're telling me the Corps don't want to capture shifters and experiment on them? Can you imagine the poor fox shifter that goes up and wants to buy genes? ""Hello I need some genetech. It's for.... It's for a fox."""

Shadowrun,3c2elw,dezzmont,2,Sat Jul 4 06:19:09 2015 UTC,I didn't say Metasapients cant. Also how would technomancer's not take genetech? Their genes aren't any different. If they were technomancy would have been figured out a long time ago.
Shadowrun,3c2elw,lordhellion,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:24:02 2015 UTC,My argument was that corporations are about 10 times more likely to want to abduct and experiment on a technomancer as they would a shifter. The previous argument was that the genes were too different (which is also applicable to metasapients) which is why that was mentioned.
Shadowrun,3c2elw,BitRunr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:26:50 2015 UTC,My point is metasapients can go and purchase them without you know being abducted. A shifter goes in looking for different genes and he's going to get captured. Your argument is making no sense. Shifters are literally the animal they shift from. So a badger shifter would need to buy badger genes. That would be a huge red flag for the corp.
Shadowrun,3c2elw,Bamce,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:29:42 2015 UTC,"Can you give a page reference to where it says that shapeshifters will be instantly abducted 100% of the time by corporations? I am not saying corporations experimenting on people isn't a thing, but plenty of groups got effected by that. For a while gnomes I believe were getting abducted to try to figure out how their magic resistance worked. The biggest risk probably isn't from corporations trying to take you, but from places considering you a paranormal creature to be hunted, and in either case both of those issues can be severely mitigated by simply traveling to one of the places where shifters are issued SiN's where they can't just grab you.  EDIT: Also, sorry if that came off a bit sarcastic, what I meant isn't that corporations aren't interested in shifters, but do you have a source showing that they have such a high level of interest in collecting shifters?"
Shadowrun,3c2elw,dethstrobe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:40:42 2015 UTC,"Foxes probably are now really common pets, especially among places with strong influence from the JIS, so you could easily just get the pattern from Renraku and get a shadowdoc to implant it.  And if you are in an EVO campus or are in any of the NAN states you could openly just walk into any corporate clinic with only slightly more risk than a registered technomancer doing the same.  Not to mention that any genetic treatment would have to be individualized per-user and the genetic difference between a human and a fox is not severe enough to make the listed treatments in core difficult to apply, especially as it is clearly extremely easy to apply exotic genetic treatments that don't even change genetic activators but instead make you partially a different species anyway."

As such their genetics are way different, so the tech wouldn't stick. Similar to how humans and dogs don't get sick from the same things."
Shadowrun,3c2elw,heimdahl81,2,Sat Jul 4 03:24:09 2015 UTC,Makes sense too since the fluff says genetech is based off of a modified strain of HMHVV. Which non-metahumans are immune to.
Shadowrun,3c2elw,heimdahl81,2,Sat Jul 4 07:16:39 2015 UTC,"Modified HMHVV is one of the ways genetech can be applied. Nanotech is another way that genetech has been applied in setting, though obviously this gives people the willies even though nanomedicine is still practiced, making asking specifically for retroviral nanites a bit of a hard sell at a given hospital or black clinic."
Shadowrun,3c2elw,heimdahl81,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"Genetics don't work that way. As long as the genetics for a given species have been mapped it would be trivially easy to get a hawk/fox/bear to start producing proteins or whatever else you want to do with genetech. Easier than producing any exotic metagenetic in any given human.  The bigger problem is getting an actual retrovirus that affects non-metahumans, which is theoretically not hard to do at all. Or you could use medical nanites."
Shadowrun,3c2elw,dezzmont,2,Sat Jul 4 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing the logic of saying, ""This wouldn't happen for [group that megacorps are willing to hunt and experiment on], because they're hunted and experimented on.""  Similar to how naga were used as guard critters until recently, I can imagine various shifters were also brought up working in security. That would mean experimenting with augmentation, often as not.   Both DNArt and chimera pets come in two grades: Commercial and Custom. Commercial grade means that a certain number of creatures are produced each season, following fashion trends. These are targeted to the high class and the middle-class aspirers. Custom grade means that the creature is a one-of-a-kind creation, made to either the artists or the benefactor’s whims.   I wouldn't go so far as to say that anyone is capable of mass producing super shapeshifters, but if absolutely no one was funding shifter-viable genecrafting when genecrafting is so present in biodrones and such, I'd be surprised."

For example one I use all the freaking time for situations like this is ""easy but slow"" and ""fast but risky"". So whatever the player goes to do after the initial dice check I present them a situation with those circumstances.  EXAMPLE    Player: ""I want to start advertising online for a flashmob to appear at this place tonight at 8pm.""  GM: ""Okay do you got an angle on how you're going to hype this or just going on pure matrix swagger?""  Player: ""I'll offer free cookies to anyone who comes.""  GM: ""Okay make a Charisma+Negotiation test.""  Player: ""Alright I got two hits.""  GM: ""It sounds like a lot of people are interested. Right now based on your estimates at least 15 people are definitely going to show up. Looking it over you could advertise a lot more and encourage word of mouth but Lonestar could catch on.

Shadowrun,3c0f5g,kaosjester,4,Fri Jul 3 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"I don't plan what the players will do during a run. It generally doesn't work because they're going to do something crazy and unexpected more often than not. In general, plan out the situation. Plan how the status quo looks, and then let the players disrupt it in their actions.  Here are two examples:    Example 1 - The Extraction  The 'runners get hired to extract a guy from a corporation. He's taking a trip to Seattle, so there are some opportunities to do this. Instead of planning out when they are going to extract him, plan out his route. Something like:   He arrives on Friday night, after dark, in a T-bird to a private Ares hanger at SeaTac. He gets into a limo there, with two SUVs of bodyguards (one leading, one covering) to go to his hotel in downtown Seattle. The bodyguards are Rating 5, and there are 8 of them. They have a decker and a mage, because they're professionals. On Saturday, midday, he leaves the hotel to play golf at the Ares Mix-Field Golf Club, a well-kept, well-secured, private Ares golf course in Everett. They take the highway both ways, same security setup. Four of his security team (including the decker, but not the mage) are following him as he golfs, and the other four are in the clubhouse. His golf partners are two Ares execs and a 'wared up Ares Desert Wars champion with a wicked cyber-implant weapon. On Saturday night he attends an Ares event at the private home of Gerald Laurens in Bellevue, who is holding it to unveil a new Ares prototype this guy worked on. He spends the night drinking and rides to a hotel with a lady he met at the party, back downtown. On Sunday, he brunches at Divert, a high-scale place in Downtown Seattle, and then heads back to the airport, boards his plane, and leaves.   That's a lot of detail. You don't need that much. The point is that if you hand the players an itinerary of the extractee, you don't have to plan them hitting him at place X or Y or Z. Maybe they hit him at the airport, out of the sky, or on the tarmac. Maybe they sneak onto the golf course or into the party. Maybe they hijack him on the road to or from one of these events. Maybe they drug him at brunch and get him out by setting a bomb off down the street and causing a panic to cover up the grab.  The point, though, is that you shouldn't expect exactly one of those exfil plans. You set up a situation, and you tell them to overcome it. Then make up details as they need to happen (e.g., what the digital security setup of the golf course looks like).    Example 2 - Prototype Procurement  In this example, the players are tasked to break into a place and retrieve a rare prototype. To facilitate this, come up with the facility in question. Detail its security, magical, digital, and physical. Does it have cameras everywhere? Security guards? Do they always have a Spider on the property? Just on-call? If they detect a break-in, how do they react? Where is this facility? What is the security response for the police / HTR?   Answer those questions, and tell them to your players. They'll get an idea of this facility, and still be tasked with the break-in. Maybe there are skylights, maybe just back doors, maybe the group realizes physical security is low so they mask up and kick in the glass panes on the front of the building. But you can't plan for all of those, so you just plan the spot out and let them do what they're going to do. And saying 'yes' can always go awesome. Unless it's a super-secure building where they wouldn't make sense, feel free to add strange and cool security flaws. The walls are totally susceptible to miniwelders, and the manager insisted on having skylights installed, and the building next door is the perfect spot to grappling gun over. Because that plan sounds great.    Also, here's a run generator. That much of a skeleton, with a little fleshed out, should be enough. Figure out who is hiring them, why, and what, and you're most of the way to done. Note the complications: unexpected (read: unscouted or hidden) security, some rivals come for the runners during the middle of a job, there's a third party who comes for the same item, that sort of stuff. Things they can't control, and things you can introduce at the best moment of their plan, as if it was naturally going to happen that way. Or you can have them happen on their own timescale! A runner team will go into a panic faster than imaginable when the guy they're paid to extract gets kidnapped the day before, while their recon guy is watching.    The only other thing I'd say is that sometimes your players will do something you didn't expect, and they will cakewalk the job as a result. If they do, let them have it. They earned it by being that creative. Sometimes paydays are easy."

Now I create a basic skeleton of the run, have basic stats for different classes of opponents, and treat it more like improv. ""Yes and"" answers to stuff. For instance, if a runner wants to access the utility cables going into a building I treat it as a chance for an exciting little side-plot in the Ork Underground, perhaps with disgruntled residents to deal with or devil rats to keep the rest of the party interested while the techy fiddles with wires."

For a decker I'll either reuse one from a previous game or go with generic npcs rules  I use maps in my game, so I'll always have a few generic ones on file - office, house, apartment block, street, major road and train station can cover most places they'll visit out of the blue  Have a page with security devices on it, randomly pick a couple to protect unexpected locations  For magic, use a similar list of security systems/procedures and pick a random one.

Shadowrun,3c0f5g,NotB0b,3,Fri Jul 3 18:32:53 2015 UTC,Plan the setting not the story.
Shadowrun,3c0f5g,DivinitusRenes,3,Fri Jul 3 22:02:31 2015 UTC,"First of all, it takes practice and the ability to improvise. Only way to really do get practice is to have your game derailed. That's how it works. Here's some tips for how to fix this sorta stuff.  Plan out interchangeable scenes.  The core rulebook is reall good at telling you this, but instead of having a linear pathway for story progression, have a bunch of scenes that could lead to one another. If the runners go off course, all you need to do is repaint one of those scenes and move around some stuff if they know about it beforehand.  I'll use an example that has happened to me. The runners were meant to do a data steal on an MCT Data Bank which required them to get their decker in manually.   They decided, nah, instead we'll impress the target we need by blackmailing him. He's a trideo game producer? Let's make an E3  demo to get him interested, then tell him we stole it from another corp. Get him agreeing to pay us cred to get the rest of the game then blackmail him with the footage.   Wayyy off course. But as they were planning, I hit them with huge software skill test times, because AAAA (It's the future, there's now quad A games) game design is hard. I told them if they stole the engine and some code from a nearby Ares game lab, they could totally build it in 2 weeks instead of 8 months.  They agreed to this course of action while I cunningly re-skinned MCT to Ares and turned Paydata into Video game source engine.  If in Doubt, ask yourself: What would realistically happen in response  So, lets say your runners had a dumb moment and decided to murder a guy they were holding hostage. You didn't expect for this to happen. Maybe he was an important guy with some cred to throw around.  You as a GM smile, sit back and say: You hear a Beeping sound coming from his body. As you approach it turns into a wail. Roll the Security Security Procedures knowledge skill or something like it.  It's a doc wagon biomnitor. He's not dead, just in overflow (Or they are coming to retrieve his body). On further inspection, it's a Super Platinum contract signal. You have spent 65 seconds already looking and examining the body. What do you do?  Then you'd have doc wagon rock up trying to find the body to resuscitate the guy. Just go from there, if they try to hit docwagon, maybe crash cart rocks up to snag the body away sneakily. If they leg it, they now have information, but have made a powerful enemy if he lives. Throw drek that makes sense to you out there and retcon it if you go back and decide ""That was a dumb idea"".   Oh and ask your players about whether or not this makes sense to them in universe. I find that helps if you're a bit on the fence.  Guide your players by warning them of the consequences  ""Are you Sure"", three little words that makes players sit up straight and behave. Warn them of possible consequences to their actions before they do them. For example:  Mt. Johnson is being racist towards your street sam. He wants to break the J's neck in the middle of a busy restaurant for being annoying. First, you tell him: You're in public, you're about to go on a murder spree. Think about how well that works out for literally anyone ever. Are you sure you want to dio this?  Second, you mention: This guy has powerful connections. If you DO manage to survive this your character will basically be hung out to dry by his contacts and gain some powerful enemies. Are you sure?  Finally, you realise this will derail the rest of the game and could lead to a TPK, making tonight's fun a bit sour because you don't like a person. Are you sure you wanna do this?  If they say yes to all of those, you have significantly warned the guy enough. Allow the party to react first to restrain him and stop him instead of an NPC trying to do it. If they don't, well Darwin is always willing to let shadowrunners in to the big Johnson Meet in the sky."

If they're making creative choices and forcing some weird rolls on my part, half the time I'll just make up the rolls. I never let my players see my dice anyway.

Of course, we always have a goal for the group to archive (we change GMs from run to run, hence everyone in the group also GMs from time to time), but for what is happening basicly is very sandboxy, with the group always being allowed to come up with their own plan and just deal with it. The only thing, that tends to drive me insane, is, when certain members of the group basicly hit a brick wall and just run against it again and again, hoping to break it down. The brick wall of course being an enemy, that is far out of their league, but they still think they can challenge them."

It all makes sense but can be a lot of book keeping for GM's and their magic users.  Also have to remember that it is just a game and if these rules don't fit yours and your players style then feel free to ignore some or all of them.

And that's why for an elite Shadowrun team that's been playing for many years there should be some consequences to their actions.  You don't become and stay a Prime Runner by slinging force 12 fireballs.  Really I've always considered Shadowrun a game where brains beats brawn every time.  I encourage runners to think about movies like Ocean's Eleven where no one dies and you still get away.  If you don't kill corp assets then they probably won't kill you.  Sorry to hijack your thread here.  Just wanted to point out to new players/GM's that it's still there game and they should play it the way they want.

Shadowrun,3c07ix,RossTheRed,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"I was of this mindset until Sunday were we tried to do the ""surprise inspection"" routine at an assembly complex and didn't half-ass it either.

Shadowrun,3c07ix,UrbanNightmare1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:20:23 2015 UTC,That is so true.  Sometimes a run calls for combat and those teams that are to intellectual don't fair well on those runs.  If my team is going to have a run like that I drop hints (as the Johnson or Fixer) that they may want to hire some goons.  I usually let the players run those goons so they can have a good time shooting up the place.

Sure, that Force 16 fireball will clear pretty much any room - but will you have another for the room after that, and after that, and after that? Because Shadowrun is a little less combat-focused than other RPGs, this is something that doesn't always come up, but it should happen often enough that mages are forced to economize."
Shadowrun,3c07ix,Beaumis,3,Fri Jul 3 19:40:56 2015 UTC,"1. Wards, Lodges, Barriers and Astral Intersection. Breaking through an astral barrier by force automatically alarms the creator. Getting through with active magic is risky at best. The only way to get through safely is to deactivate all your magic. Which is tough in the case of quickened spells.  2. Long Term Binding For the cheap price of Karma equal to the spirits force you can have a spirit perform one specific task for a year and a day. That's a bargain for the corps and they make use of it extensively. Sites that warrant magical protection but not a full time magician might be guarded by patrolling spirits with standing orders to kill everyone not bearing the proper badges. They never eat, they never sleep and they patrol the premises for a year and a day.  3. The Spirit World remembers The why is a big unknown but the fact remains that every spirit knows how badly you've treated the rest of them. Mistreat spirits and they will seek revenge. Spirits love to be in the world and they don't mind ""serving"" as long as the tasks they perform are somewhat dignified. A fire spirit will love to burn your enemies but it will hate you forever for making it fight in the rain. A great form spirit will dislike being your waiter. A disgruntled spirit will take your orders literally and bend the rules as far as it can because it can. A vengeful spirit will take any chance it gets to make your life miserable. And Ghost help you if you encounter spirits that actually have orders to kill you."

Shadowrun,3c07ix,Frostily,5,Sat Jul 4 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"Spirit reputation, and negative qualities related to them."
Shadowrun,3c07ix,dezzmont,2,Fri Jul 3 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"Now, p.312 carefully says this requires a magician. Not a Mystic Adept or Adept with Astral Perception. Not even a Spirit. Might be an oversight, but RAW at least it means that those signatures are that much harder to erase if you're not a Magician   It is an oversight, unless you are going to argue that an adept with astral perception can't assense at all, as the terminology 'magician' is used pretty much exclusively throughout that chapter.   Just look at those examples and see how common those things are. Violent crime areas? Churches and other places of worship? Heavy pollution days? The only time you should be casting with no penalties is if you're in a pristine area.   The problem with background count is that it actually really doesn't work as written because it makes the average mage, magic 3, spellcasting 3, completely unable to practice magic.  Using backgroun counts, the low grade ones, frequently doesn't even really stop mage PCs, as they can easily ignore the penalties. What it does do is create a magical arms race where every corporate mage you want to use has to be impossibly powerful to be able to effecitvely cast. It also kills adepts as a concept, which is sad.  They tried to dodge it however by explicitly spelling out that a mage is acclimated to their home city automatically.   Unless your Magician is of a tradition that treats Spirits well, bargains with them, or respects them, and even then, the Spirits you summon are often unwilling.   Explicitly untrue. Man-With-Many-Names is in fact, wrong more often than he is right, and even made a point of saying so. Spirits you summon are always willing. That is how spirit index works, it is a measure of how many spirits are still willing to help you, and the higher it gets the fewer spirits will nibble on your life energy. Spirits are responding to your summoning in order to earn little bits of life energy to grow stronger, and make a point of not coming to mages who treat them poorly. Treating a spirit poorly also is a counter intuitive thing, insulting a spirit or forcing it to carry your baggage (outside of some weird situations, spirits are individuals and I wouldn't recommend asking a force 12 great form spirit to do this unless it was a task spirit) isn't treating it poorly, but distrupting enemy spirits is. Spirits be weird like that. It is also important to note that binding is not actually an offense to spirits, it is just uncomfortable because it introduces uncertainty and the potential for you to seriously harm them. That said I would echo that you should endeavour to be cool to your bound spirits, as they are your strongest tool.   These have the same Astral Signature as your Magician   No they don't. You leave your signature when summoning but they don't actually have your signature, because the spirit is actually a free being.   If you dismissed (SR5 p.165) it that just frees it from its bond to you, it can choose to stay and exact revenge. Running out of services is the same thing.   Street Grimoire notes that, A: Spirits chosing to stick about when they get freed from your control is absurdly rare because it inevitably creates a free spirit, and B: Spirits actually can't leave your control outside of very specific situations, most of them involving an extremely high force spirit that has been routinely mistreated by a mage who just passed out. Esentially you should only have a spirit not go back to its metaplane if the dismissal is in a situation epic enough to deserve a free spirit devoted to it.  Remember, that being a mage has extreme costs. It requires sacrifices both over the game, and during character gen. Don't try to take that away from a PC playing a mage, as being awakened is 'meant' to be a huge advantage that people fight over.    That said I do have a few things to toss in about stamping down on mage supremacy.  1: Mages have very inefficient ways to increase some key survival stats: While shadowrun in no way enforces squishy wizards, they can wear great armor like anyone else and many have rather good defense dice too, especially on a full defense, mages can't easily increase their soak dice without sustained spells. Likewise, mages can't increase their initiative dice easily without drugs or sustained magic, meaning options such as full defense might even take them out of the fight. This means the mage is almost always the slowest, easiest to hit, and easiest to shut down roles in a firefight. While the samurai can ignore a good surpressing fire zone, mages almost never can.  2: Magic is almost always line of sight dependant: One of the easieset ways for a non-mage to defend themselves against a mage is to toss out a smoke grenade. While the mage can still send spirits out and use indirect combat magic through the smog, many of their most devistating spells cease teo work.  3: While background count should not be overused, remember that it exists and affects more than just spellcasting dice. Having an omnipresant background count of 2-3 is a good way to get your adept players to physically assault you for being a jerk, but remember that background counts are still common, especially in places people don't regularly converge and thus wash out the count. These places aren't uncommon in the barrens, and while it is unlikely a corp will place a facility in a background count, they will almost certainly be near some if they are in the barrens. This has a minor affect on PC mages (Though not a big one, arguably mild background counts benefit the stronger mage in a situation) but has a pretty large effect on their stuff. Sustained spells lose force when they enter, which doesn't come back once the background count is left. Foci de-activate when they pass through a count stronger than them as well, and take an action to re-activate. Don't be afraid to use strong localized background counts to force mages and teams to think tactically about where they are going.  4: Magic is not actually that subtle. Casting a spell does not require any outward motion on the part of the caster, but that does not mean you can just start slinging mojo in a crowded street. High force spells are very visible for most mages. Casting at a force equal to your spellcasting dice means that it is literally impossible to not notice you are a spellcaster.  5: Watchers are better than spirits (For the GM): Mutch like how /u/Beaumis pointed out that breaking a ward alerts the creator, breaking a spirit alerts the creator too. In fact, even fighting it or banishing it alerts the creator due to the spirit summoner link, a much misunderstood concept that people misinterpret as having something to do with astral signatures or ritual magic targeting. In reality the spirit summoner link is essentially perfect, constant telepathy, and it sucks because it means you can't have spirit guards in a run that is intended to be a sneaky peaky type. Spirits can spot unusual out of place auras as long as they have time to assense them, meaning disugises will fail at checkpoints, and spirit patrols can instantly spot other active astral forms and people who are invisibile or sneaking around in vents. Essentially they are the perfect guards, too perfect, with no real way to take them out quietly unless their mage is on site and not somehow checkpointed behind the spirit. So what do you do? Use watchers. Watchers are extremely cheap for a corp to make, about 100 nuyen for a week of work, less than a salary of a guard and much less than that of a bound spirit, and most importantly lack a spirit summoner link, meaning that the watcher must physically report to a mage to alert them something happened. This means most watchers check in on the hour or every couple of hours, or perhaps never and just alert their master or the head of security if something is wrong. This means that the party's mage can disable them without instantly alerting the building, giving you a method of having astral security that can be disabled without instantly raising the alarm."

Of course Adepts can Assense, but the wording here is pretty damn specific. I don't think it's intended, it's just rather poorly written.    The problem with background count is that it actually really doesn't work as written because it makes the average mage, magic 3, spellcasting 3, completely unable to practice magic.

It also kills adepts as a concept, which is sad.   I would assume that a wagemage or salarishaman has acclimated to their offices or wherever they may be. I wouldn't give them a penalty, I'd aspect it towards them. It does hurt Adepts with active magic skills though, but their cybered up counterparts couldn't walk in through the front door without setting off every metal detector there. Tradeoffs must exist.   What is fair for the game is up to the GM. I'm not arguing all of these measures have to be put in place, but they are there.   No they don't. You leave your signature when summoning but they don't actually have your signature, because the spirit is actually a free being.   That seems odd. Astral Tracking mentions a link between the summoner and the Spirit, I assumed this was a mixing of the Astral Signatures, but apparently it isn't explicitly stated as such.  I bow to your knowledge of Spirit agency."

You can basicly even poison an enemy, even if you don't hit (if his defense roll equals your attack roll). If your poison is potent enough, this is a nice way, to get rid of many enemies within a short period of time. Given of course that their armor is not chemically sealed.  Speaking of: Chemical seal and a helmet with airtanks for an hour. Really, it is great. Somebody wants to poison you with gas? Well, tough luck for him, because you are nearly invincible to his poison. You want to knock out a gas stun granade but don't want those baddies throw it back to you?

Shadowrun,3c14tz,marcus_gideon,0,Mon Jul 6 00:10:06 2015 UTC,"""Spray on RFID tags""? You realize they aren't quite that tiny, right? RFIDs are the little sticker they put on products to set off the alarm if you walk out of the store without paying. The smallest ones are a chip injected under the skin to identify employees at checkpoint scanners. But they aren't atomized and aerosolized so you can spritz them all over someone. Now if you wanted to tag somebody with an RFID, there is a type of ammo round just for that in Run & Gun. But that's a tracker the size of a bullet, not a water molecule.  In addition, if the assassin was Invisible but not Improved Invisible then any electronic detection would pick them up. That includes drones, cameras, thermal vision, etc. Now if they were Improved Invisible, then electronics wouldn't pick them up, and that would include detecting AROs.  Now one thing you can do, is work together as a team in order to overcome the odds. Rigger deploys a few Fly Spies, each equipped with Ultrasonic sensors. They spread out around the room, and create a sound based map of the room. Decker takes that info, and overlays it with any tactical data he can gather from the team's Smartguns, creating a tactical HUD he can send out to the team's Eyeware as a bunch of AROs. Basically turning the room into a First Person Shooter with target designations and everything. Now of course, you could do the same thing with a P-Tac, if you can afford them. But this way works just as well, and although more time consuming, feels more fair since it requires teamwork instead of just a single gadget.  As far as tricks for meatsuit survival...  Suppressing Fire is your friend, always and forever. Particularly if you have belt fed machine guns, and you can just spray and pray. However, the sidebar on Core pg 180 says you can still use SF with less bullets. Technically speaking, you can Suppress with a single bullet, affecting a 1 meter cone. That's enough to cover a doorway or narrow hallway, potentially hitting anyone who ventures through.  Speaking of a single bullet... some marksmen build up a huge dice pool so they can hopefully hit several opponents at once with a barrage of bullets. But you can also lump that entire dice pool into a single shot. Spend a point of Edge to bypass Accuracy and allow exploding 6's, and you can inflict some serious hurt with that one shot. Whether you shoot the vehicle full of holes, or just a well placed shot through the driver's side window, they won't be chasing you anymore.  There aren't many problems that can't be solved with grenades. AOE damage can't be defended against, so if you get the grenade at their feet, all they get is Armor soak. If you want to go for the gold, look up ""chunky salsa"" rules for explosions in confined spaces. On the other hand, if you're against making such a mess, there are also gas grenades that deal tons of Stun damage. Toss a few of those into the room full of bad guys, and now you have a bunch of unconscious bodies to walk over."

Shadowrun,3c1rbc,dethstrobe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:40:08 2015 UTC,"I'd completely disagree with that.  4th used build points. You have 400 points, and you can turn those points into attributes(your physical and mental stats), skills(how trained your at something), qualities (character defining perks), nuyen (to buy gear, which there is a LOT of).  The problem is without any system mastery, you have no idea what's important.  Say you want to be a hacker. You think, hackers are smart people, I'll go and max out my logic. And then once you start playing you find out that your mental stats are completely useless in the Matrix, which means you just wasted a bunch of points of maxing out logic.  SR5 still has its fair share of chargen traps, but it's a little harder to make a useless character. In SR5, there are 5 things you pick, your metatype (race) which also gives you special points to make you more lucky or magical. Your attributes which make you smarter or stronger. Your magic, which is if you want to be magical. Your skills, to figure out what you're trained in. And lastly your resources, which gives you nuyen to go buy gear.  No matter which edition you pick. Gear will always take the longest...unless you're an awakened with priority E Resources."

Shadowrun,3byzu6,GFFU,6,Fri Jul 3 20:00:00 2015 UTC,"The session was a while ago, im a bit fuzzy on the details of the actions but here is the gist of it. Our crew was hired to teach some manners to Association Para-Nobilis (APN), a policlub of elves and elf wannabees that are doing hatecrimes against metahumans that stand in the way of their cause. After we first snoop around at APN we continue to do some legwork and find a lead on investigator called Kerry Taylor that did some exposé on those hate crimes.  We walk into her house and convince her to come with us for protection (because some of her crew have already been whacked by APN and to give us info.  We walk out of the house and Kerry gets  plugged with a serious wound (we play third edition in that campaign, and fifth in another) from a sniper rifle.  We see a cocky arrogant elf casually strutting away half a block away, while we get hit by a dozen mooks (poorly trained wannabe elfs as in humans with fake ears). My character a blaxploitation inspired female street sam  Jade Brown(think Pam Grier in the ‘70 but as 2 meter tall muscular ork , 15 cm stiletto heels and 40 cm afro,  cybered up for tanking instead of initiative),  gets the initiative, fast draws and drops a mook with her trusty savalette);  our Dwarf rigger Kurt (double red Mohawk, takes his shotgun almost everywhere) drops a mook as well.  The mooks shoot, mostly miss, some get me, but titanium bone lacing, orthoskin, and a set of layered armour make me shrug off their pea shooters but they  get the mage for a light wound. One of the mooks throws a grenade at us that starts to cook. Our decker Smoke (a chainsmoking lowlife who has a thing with grenades, good skills and incredible luck) coolly picks up the grenade and throws it back at the mooks).  Our cat shaman is playing his first session (having just joined the group initially as bodyguard to Kerry the investigator) cast some spell at the mooks as well. Our mage Jimmy Wong (hermetic, Asian and with strong organised crime ties) cast a high level levitate on the dude that shot Kerry long dinstance, aces that roll, and now that dude is flying back to us, 15 meter up the air at breakneck speed). Next  I haul our wounded reporter to the van,  the grenade ravages the mooks,  the decker takes potshots at the remaining mooks, the rigger gets into the car taking potshots underway(he is more the driver than a rigger really, we are a bunch of low lives).  The flying dude shoots the mage, spends fucking karma on the roll and the mage is over deadly damage.  Unable to sustain the levitate, the dude takes a 10+ meter fall and has a moderate wound.  I haul the mage to the car while taking potshots at the remaining mooks who are starting to scatter, decker and rigger and shaman get into the car taking potshots .while I provide cover fire.   The rigger /driver aces a doughnut to align the car with the crawling duded that was flying and runs him over twice. Me still outside use the rifle on the throat of the run over dude and then yank his head off; I get into the moving van while the driver hauls ass,  the rest of the crew clears the mooks with potshots and the mage is bleeding out.  As we hear the police sirens coming closer while we drive to our street doc we give a warm smile to Kerry the reporter, as in you’re safe with us now, while she almost pukes looking her own wounds, the dying mage and the head I had casually tossed in a corner of the van. The mage fails his body rolls after karma and is left with minus 1 intelligence,  fuck his luck!  We start planning our revenge on APN.

I'm sustaining it on myself and another teammate (the Spirit's on the ground already). We're drifting slowly downwards as the LAV we were in just a few moments ago intersected with several Thunderstruck gauss slugs and about a dozen military grade missiles.   Our Face is on his commlink, desperately trying to buy help from anyone in range. The Street Sam pops out his cyberarm gyro and tries to shoot down incoming rockets, he succeeds despite a -12 penalty in shooting a pair of rockets down. I'm trying to get my last bound Spirit (yeah that's another story) to Conceal us, but there's incoming on the ground below and the Spirit of Man can't fight and sustain at the same time.  So I end up lobbing Stunballs (it's 4E) at them, to some effect. Our B&E expert is a Throwing Adept so she's picking up debris from our LAV and hurling it at the shooters below. Don't ask me how that works.  Then the Drake we were extracting wakes up while freefalling and saves himself from a lithobraking maneuver. A Spirit of Air he summoned earlier saved him and provides some cover while he tries to escape. Oh hells no.  So while we're falling, dodging flaming LAV debris, being shot at from beyond visual range with rockets, facing fire from below, we all decide to not only use our Levitate movements to slow our descent but to angle us towards our escaping Drake.  I landed on him, punched him with my mage's cyberfist and the Spirit of Air goes nuts on us and attacks my Spirit of Man (closest ally). It gets disrupted and I get physical drain trying to arrest my two teammates' falls by casting Physical Barrier.  I angled the barrier like a slide. So me and the B&E expert were behind it while the Sam and Face were sliding towards the ground crew, firing and swearing. I think the Face was still negotiating on the price.   Eventually, some drones hired by the Face showed up to provide cover and the Rigger NPC he hired shows up in a freaking Nightsky.   My Bound Spirit goes bye bye as it holds off the ground crews. My mage nearly passes out summoning another Spirit of Man and I pass along control of it to the Face while my mage takes a nap.  We hit a landmine soon after. The Drake wakes up, we all straggle outwards and fight towards our boat (that we stole, but that's not important right now).   We left Manila for Hong Kong still under fire.

This warped lil' ninja then tried to kill the entire team by inviting them all over for cookies (which he was baking from scratch). In order to geek the team good, he didn't rely on his cooking skill and the poisons he had access to. Oh no. Instead, he wired the apartment with c4 bricks on timers. Due to a random amazing Int roll (this was 2e), the merc with the high-freq cyberears (and experience with explosives) catches the tell-tale whine of one brick's countdown timer, and finds the c4 while ninjaBoy's in the kitchen. The merc attempts to ambush the nija when he comes out (didn't want to give anything away, in case the cookie ninja had a back up plan). Ninjaboy uses shuriken dosed with ""troll tranq"" for the ensuing fight, and just barely knocks the Merc unconscious when a crit-fail has him catch his breath by putting his hand out to brace himself against the apartment's door frame - which just happened to have one of the troll-tranq shuriken, (which had missed the merc earlier), sticking out of it. While merc & ninja had a little race toward consciousness, and the rest of the team was en route, the explosives (and cookie timers!) continued their countdown...   2) In another game (an adapted Call of C'thulhu module), my players were investigating a ""haunted"" apartment building.

The decker's player then asked me ""is it a Free Action to move a thumb? How about two thumbs?"" I wasn't certain what he was going on about, so I said, ""yeah, sure!"" This decker had been holding 2 grenades. He popped the pins & dropped them into the swarm...  Good. Times."

Shadowrun,3byzu6,DivinitusRenes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"It was my first campaign as a player. It was my first time doing a tabletop at all, in fact. I was running as a roid-crazy, drunken, adamantium-boned, high strength/body, low intelligence, stereotype of a Troll. (I was young. Don't judge me.)  Anyway, we were in the middle of an epic firefight. Our gunners were trying to pick off dangerous targets. Our mage was trying to lay down cover. And this big NPC was trying to escape. Now, Steve (my troll) really didn't like that. So he decided it would suit his interest to charge at the NPC as fast as he possibly could. I burned some edge, had several exploding 6's, and ended up with way more hits than should have been possible. As the NPC was about to round the corner and head out a door, Steve ran into him. And didn't stop. Until he slammed into the wall. The poor puny human was crushed between Steve's bulk and the reinforced concrete wall. Enough bones were broken the NPC could no longer walk. Little did I know, the NPC was crucial to the next three sessions my GM had planned. He broke out into sorrowful yet hysterical laughter as every other player at the table collectively sighed. Our GM had to scrap almost a month's worth of preparation because, as he revealed to me after the session, his rolls for the NPC glitched against my exploding 6's."

Shadowrun,3byzu6,RunnerPakhet,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:08:54 2015 UTC,"Well, my favorite moments with my own characters normally evolve around being just a freaking good sniper. Right now we basicly play two entwined plots. In one I am playing a street sam, in the other a physical adept/assassine. Both are skilled snipers and hence both did a couple of awesome shots.  One of my favorite shots probably was, when Pakhet, my Street Sam, shot a ghule, who was hiding under a manhole cover, on a 200m distance through a small hole in that metal cover. Another one of hers was, when she one hitted an enemy, that had a 42 dices defense role.   With the assassine - name's Rain - it probably was, when she sniped somebody in the neck with a crossbow while on rough sea and while a fucking level 10 toxic spirit was materilising right before her.  Though in all honesty. Probably one of my favorite moments was just two weeks ago and was mostly due to an NPC. You see, we have a ""muscle for hire"" NPC. A minotaur named Crash. And we needed to play Urban Brawl (aka, we masqueraded as an Urban Brawl amateur team to get into the arena and hence were forced to play). Pakhet basicly got shot at by the entire enemy team, after doing her sniping-thing again (though mostly, because the enemy team had realized, that she was the tactician of our team), when our adept tried to run the three main offenders over with his motorcycle. He failed. Badly. But he and his motorcycle landed just in front of Crash and the adept was like: ""Throw me! But don't tell the elf!"" and Crash threw him and one hitted the entire bunch of our enemies with it. It was glorious!  Well, and then there are those small moments in between. These are more on the role play kind of way. You see, Pakhet was never written to be the leader of the team, but because the team lacks a leader and she does know a thing or two about tactics, most of the team have accepted her as a leader by now. And there have been a couple of cute moments with this. Like said adept introducing a new runner to the team, with the words: ""This is Pakhet. She is our sniper and I would say, you better do, what she tells you... Also, anything else is not quite healthy."" Or when our shaman was quite adamant that she should accompany him on a mission, because it would highly raise the chances of survival. Also he was like ""And she is our best close combat fighter"". Which technically is not true, as she has barely 8 dices in close combat... But till now she actually dealt the most damage in close combat, because I have a luckier dice role, then the adept, who really is just unlucky..."

Shadowrun,3bz3ve,Senet_KDR,3,Fri Jul 3 09:11:09 2015 UTC,"In the AI test builds I did so far I spend my nuyen on cyberdecks and drones. Programs aren't even possible to buy with money (p. 158) because they cost karma. The cyberdeck, which the AI ""lives"" on would be carried in a backpack by one of its fellow runners I think to don't have to deal with distance noise.  In my understanding lifestyle costs depend on the devices the AI maes its home device. For example a rating 3 cyberdeck would have the monthly costs of a low or medium lifestyle (Sidebar, page 157).  Therefore thats one thing were AI PCs can spend money on because with higher grade equipment come higher lifestyle cost."
Shadowrun,3bz3ve,OLStefan,2,Fri Jul 3 09:57:37 2015 UTC,"Just re-checked and you're spot on, programs are bought with karma and not nuyen.  Seems like our original impression was correct.

You can attach a commlink or a wireless datatap to wired network and you now have wireless access to that network.  EDIT-1: and from a real-world logic point of view, no one wants to spend the money to string copper and fiber-optic cable everywhere when a simple wireless dongle costs just a buck or 2.  EDIT-2: Just like modern businesses, Ma and Pa places don't have their own hosts, they run their ""host"" off of a free virtual machine at a big host aggregator. All they have to do is pay a small monthly fee (or nothing and deal with Ads)."
Shadowrun,3bxvdo,helionwulf,2,Fri Jul 3 01:44:48 2015 UTC,But a whole bunch of that copper should still be in place from the first matrix it just isn't in much use.
Shadowrun,3bxvdo,sb_747,3,Fri Jul 3 05:24:26 2015 UTC,"Sorta. This is 2075. Plenty of time for wear, tear, and liquidation. It's fairly reasonable to assume large swaths of copper are gone.  More important than the cables are the data centers that redirect traffic. Those are definitely gone and replaced with equipment that would only work with the new matrix.  Consider a Matrix crash as everyone everywhere having to switch Operating Systems. I don't mean the GUI ontop as that can be recreated. The fundamental underlying code gets messed up. Matrix crashes dug deep into all the networks in use. It wasn't just a change in public connections."
Shadowrun,3bxvdo,VerboseAnalyst,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:01:24 2015 UTC,"But necessity is the mother of invention. What is to say that the data centres can't be built from old tech like mentioned in another reply? The software could be pirated from somewhere using a more stable connection and then ported over to the newly rebuilt data transfer station. Again, new to the matrix so not sure if this would/could work though."
Shadowrun,3bxvdo,VerboseAnalyst,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:15:11 2015 UTC,"Pointing out that I'm chatting to you twice :)  So to be a bit more technical about it.  The issue is that people where making money and they had no reason to build on old hardware. Especially in the jump from wired to wireless core routing. In fact the new matrix in 4e fluff was a ""pass the signal along via any device capable of wireless"" network so it didn't really need a central place to work. So clearly the underlying hardware is fairly different.  More important then the underlying hardware is the underlying firmware and the core code below the operating system. (I used OS in my previous as a simplification). That is what they needed to change in response to crashes to try to prevent another one. The entire internet and all the computers connected to it crashed. Imagine how people would try to put everything back together off of that. They'd cobble, sure, but a lot would get thrown out too. We are not talking Windows 7->8. We are talking closer to Windows -> Linux. So software is all fragged to hell too.  So picture a big building where all the wires go to for a city. (3e to 4e jump) It is now totally outdated. As a city and beurarcy why keep staff there? Why not save the money? Heck it isn't even your building. It was a corps building that had the contract for internet in the city. Your a government in Shadowrun where a ton is privatized. So you are the corp that lost the contract and you have all this crap in this building you are leasing. Well time to sell as much of it as you can, throw out the rest, and get those offices making new money. Or go bankrupt. (ooo bankrupt old abandoned place with all computers that a specific cities poor managed to get partially operational)  My point is that it's clear that the default is that utilities have upgraded well past the point and have lost most of the underlying infrastructure to go back. Which I feel can be approached in an interesting way that adds more texture. (which is why I keep throwing out ideas for cool ways to do exceptions). The trick is to  remember that norm does mean norm and it is not justifiable to have the entire barrens suddenly sporting fiber optic or copper cabling.  It's also definitely not something the unimaginative average corp drone would bother with. Let it be something that is informative by being an exception.  PS: A good bit of what I'm saying is not reflected in the fluff. I'm fairly critical of Catalysts way of writing fluff in general. So I'm applying my own logic and justifications to wrench things into something that makes sense to me while approaching their fluff. Also their 4e fluff surrounding the Matrix was terrible and I am not done being sour about it all.  PPS: Oh I'd also like to point out that yes the major information highway trunks should be cable. How the hell is a wireless signal getting data from seattle to japan without travelling through some cables...."

Shadowrun,3bxvdo,UrbanNightmare1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:49:56 2015 UTC,"About edit-2:  I think of it this way...  For most people running a web server and keeping the security up and knowing what they are doing to host a web site today is not worth the hassle.  So they go to places like GoDaddy or CanadianWebHosting and have them serve up their site.  The even have templates and shopping carts with payment systems already installed.  All you have to do is load your inventory and a few snap shots.  So GoDaddy would be the host (with lots of servers and bandwidth), your store is just one of thousands on that host.  About Edit-1: Sure lots of buildings will still have copper/fiber run in them.  But they maybe dark and unused now.  You may find that the low lifestyles may try and light up a bit of it in a single building to share access or to provide better security(?).  But for the most part wireless has taken over."
Shadowrun,3bxvdo,CitizenJoseph,2,Fri Jul 3 15:12:55 2015 UTC,There is no reason wired sections sections of the matrix can't be hooked up to the wireless sections.  All it takes is a base station.
Shadowrun,3bxvdo,marcus_gideon,2,Fri Jul 3 02:27:02 2015 UTC,"The way I see it...  We've got ethernet and fiber running all over the place these days. The whole world is a wired network, with some wireless stuff here and there. But even that is joined together on the backbone with wires. However, when you take a look at the latency in your video games, or the load time on a streaming movie, you realize that even those wired connections aren't very fast. Now imagine what that latency is going to do to your melon when you're trying to stream Hot-Sim VR from around the globe.  Thus, most of the advances went towards making faster and faster WiFi. Eventually getting to a point that we can effectively stream Hot-Sim speeds without a problem. Which is why the new wireless stuff is so prevalent.  However, everybody knows that once you send it out into the airwaves, it's only a matter of time before somebody cracks it and steals it out of the air. And there are a number of ways to mitigate that threat. They could be using WiFi inhibiting paint / wallpaper when they set up shop someplace. Or if they knew from the start, they could have built a Faraday Cage into the walls themselves. Either way, they can maintain a wireless network inside allowing everybody to use Comms and terminals and whatnot, while shielding from outside interference. Teams needs to get inside at least before they can hack anything.  If they are super paranoid, they could wire the entire building and avoid wireless entirely. SR1-3 were all wired settings, SR4 was the first time they suggested wireless was a thing ""in the future"". So it's still possible for people to make wired networks that compete with ""modern"" wireless connections. And it's possible that old buildings may still have wiring, unless somebody salvaged it already. But a completely wired network means you don't have access to any global assets. For a super secret squirrel facility, that may be just the thing. But for a corporate office, they can't afford to be totally isolated. Either way, in a facility like that you need to get inside and plug into the network.   On one occasion, we were attempting to hack a facility to steal some prototype designs. The facility was completely wired, and shielded from the outside. A very deeply buried cable ran from the building to the corp office. However, the office was like any other, with wireless functions. Conveniently enough, one of the assistants had their office calls forwarded to their station inside the facility. So a conveniently timed Snoop showed us the way in...   I really don't think there is a specific line drawn anywhere, saying ""you can only have THIS much wired and wireless"". It's really up to the GM, as to how easy or hard they want it to be to get at the data. If the point of the mission was to get the data, and use it towards the more important endgoal, then you don't necessarily need to keep it in Fort Knox. Unless you want to drag the mission out and make each step its own mission. But sometimes you just want to say ""Roll a Matrix Search"" and give them what they need so the game can keep rolling along.  As for Mom and Pop's, nobody said you NEED a Host in order to exist on the Matrix. Every device has an Icon, from your power lacing shoes, to your skidmark detecting undies, to the Commlink in your pocket or the terminal on the counter. They can handle online orders through the cash register, or the desktop in the lounge next to the employee fridge, just as easily as they could through a virtual environment inside a Host."

Shadowrun,3bxvdo,VerboseAnalyst,2,Fri Jul 3 08:10:05 2015 UTC,The way I'll be approaching the problem is by having some of the middle and lower areas still have a good bit of old infrastructure in use. Cyberdecks prove that old tech can still be kitbashed into working today with the right mix of tech. So I'm sure there are some jurry rigged together old time-y technology.  First of all Fiberoptic / Wireless may be what they need I/O on for communication / matrix /entertainment...but they are still getting power via electric lines. It isn't like cable is never getting laid down. The key is that it isn't used commercially for matrix solutions.  So separate it out. Commercial and actual people (npcs). Any place that's high or above orders all their crap new and shiny from a catalog. Those catalogs don't have any old matrix tech on offer. Why would they? Yet any given NPC may find some older tech that still works when they plug it in! With middle and lower being well justified to try to make as many of their old assets function as possible.  Matrix tech may be cheap enough baseline that it's taken over all the vogue but not everyone is in style/into the fads. A locals only bar tucked away somewhere may have an old flatvid hooked up to display the current fight matches by a guy the owner knows. That bar may also have an older model display hooked up to a wireless access node to get drink orders off peoples AR and put it in front of the ludite bartender. This bar may have zero pieces of AR customization inside. An older drone that has a tray attached to wheel drinks around may be upgraded a bit under the hood to keep the RC signal clear and problem free.  I'll point out that IRL some establishments that take credit cards still have [old fashioned manual credit card machine(http://www.wsj.com/articles/will-credit-card-breaches-give-knuckle-busters-a-second-crack-1409365854)] tucked away somewhere in case the net goes down. They may use it once a year but it takes up so little storage space why throw it out? Keep it for the few times when it comes in very handy.  In any event my key point is that it would be unusual and somewhat distinctive to use old tech. I also hope I have impressed upon you that even when that old tech is used it would often have some adjustments to interface with what is popular.

Shadowrun,3bxvdo,DocDeeISC,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:12:14 2015 UTC,"Just remember that there is a difference between home/office/building infrastructure, block infrastructure, and city infrastructure.  There is a ton of justification for all of the city and block infrastructure that sends matrix across cabling being going. Some specific blocks for specific reasons may still have hook ups but you should know why.  Some ideas for that.   new cable that was laid down to avoid attracting attention (as people in slum areas might investigate to find a wireless signals source). This cable is connecting a few buildings via sewers and is used by _____ (Small time decker gang, locals, some shadowrunners, a couple of off the grid scientists who connected their bolt holes). This specific apartment building hasn't had it's wiring raided and it's cheap housing. So the place is full of old tech and the owner has connected the buildings network into the matrix but everything is slow as heck. (Lots of noise rating to replicate slow signal speeds). But hey at least you can download a trid over a few hours then watch it! This corp is actually intelligent about their internal security and has specifically wired up as a security measure. These research computers are connected via wire and have no access to wireless to prevent accidental leaks of data. This was done by in house IT/science staff so security is still pre-packaged craptastic. This house is owned by a crazy old lady with a shotgun. She's shot at any salesmen that come to her front door. She has occasionally purchased a datadisk loaded with entertainment from a kids she knows (more precisly the grandson of someone she knew). She mostly re-watches old soaps. Everythings gotten too complicated and she wants to enjoy retirement in peace. This apartment may be low but it has plenty of wireless. In fact none of the residents are aware that it's a wired apartment. This is because the wires are attached to camera systems only the owner knows about. (either security or perversion depending on where you want to take this) In this high lifestyle apartment two people are having an affair. One of them is IT and used a drone to snake a cable to a hidden device in the others apartment. They plan their trysts without ever leaving a matrix trail. Just ask the magic mirror who the fairest of them all is and discuss when the next exec meeting leaves you alone. These two young decker wannabes share housing. They had this great realization when combing old tech documents online. Those power lines in the house? They can double as signal lines! They send super secret messages like ""drink your ovaltine"" with their ""power plug communicators"" after classes and feel like proper shadow wannabes. (They both try to take up shadowrunning. One dies.) This data-dealer has a custom built central hub with cables sprawling out to a plethora of assorted devices. Different devices carry different permissions and they use their strange network to help them swap identities and clearances. They also swap to match for compatibility for just a little extra oomph. Old school shadowrunners feel right at home as they try to avoid tripping over the spider web of cables. Mr Tinfoil hat is literally wearing a tinfoil hat. The only wireless device they run is a jammer. It's all wires all the time for this guy and some of it's still connected to toasters. Crazy bastard.   Subnote: It occurs to me that overlooking cabling in walls is likely a common tactical fault in SR NPC land. If you don't expect it to be there why would you check? This has many implications for our glorious unusual shadowrunners.  Subnote 2: Mr Tinfoil may me remeber an important detail of wireless that I think 5e carries over from 4e fluff. The random crap gadgets you get to furnish homes tend to be wireless too. Rather then wall cabling it should be way more common to see people use throwback toasters. Could even play some ""this old toaster would sell well online to buy it for life folks as the newer Azzie brand plasticrap breaks within 2 years garunteed and shares your hotpippet flavor preferences with Azzie.""

They could never track down Denial Howling Coyote, and when they did bullets would bend around him and bounce off his skin. These guys hadnt been exposed to magic for 50 years.

But I can't forgive the lore and ""feel"" changes they made.  They introduced real world slang and mannerisms and removed the colourful replacements like ""drek"" and ""chummer"".  A decent amount of what the world was had been removed with the sale from FASA.

Barely any of this is explained in the 5E books thus far.  Data Trails at least covers a bit about Deus and something of the older matrix, but there's still a lot of holes that you don't know about.  Magic as it used to be was much more colourful and interesting, albeit slower and a vast plain of rules to digest (something I suggest you at least try to do, things like how voudou worked was very thematic if mostly fluff).  There's also interesting power struggles that have developed in the past up to the present (relative to SR5).  Tir Tairngire for instance was a secretive state ruled by a monarchy of sorts up until 3E, and now it's a democratic that has more equality and less ""elves and everyone else"" elitism.  That I believe happened during 4E.  The other thing to consider for context is the Neo Anarchist podcast.  I haven't listened to much of it, but it seems to cover the context of how life in the shadows of the 2070s came to be a thing.  If you've wondered why many things are the way they are (like why corporations basically run the world and governments are mostly powerless, or how the NAN has managed to claim and hold such large swaths of land for decades) then I suggest giving it a listen."
Shadowrun,3bxxgf,insert_topical_pun,5,Fri Jul 3 14:26:50 2015 UTC,"I know who Deus is. =)  I found a copy of Renraku Arcology Shutdown and read it.  GREAT stuff.  Very creepy.  I'm almost sad we're like 2 decades past that in game.    The corps I just assume is the usual Cyberpunk trope.  Economic disaster happens, corps sue for extraterritoraility, idiot congress grants it due to massive bribes and ignorance, only to find out they just made corporations the new superpowers and are now castrated as a politcal force.    At least in Cyberpunk 2020 (my flavor of the genre growing up), the corps and govts left each other alone.  The corps ran the world economically, but the govts still had JUST enough power to how that ""we may not be able to shut you all down, but we can SERIOUSLY fuck you up if you push us too far"".    If I remember, the inciting incident was some AAA megacorp was revealed to have backed the assassination of the Prez.  So one year later to the day, the US govt hit every office branch worldwide in a single massive coordinated strike.  In 24 hours, almost every executive that worked for the corp was dead.  The few that escaped were hunted down like Nazi war criminals for the next decade.  After that the MegaCorps and the Govts unofficially agreed to an understanding of circles of influence.  The corps were still in top, but the govts made it clear ""just because we're weak doesn't mean we're toothless."""
Shadowrun,3bxxgf,Trickybiz,2,Fri Jul 3 14:33:49 2015 UTC,"In Shadowrun it's actually covered in the first two Neo Anarchist podcasts, how corps got extraterritoriality.  Spoiler, judges are dumb asses.    It's not exactly fair to say that governments have no power in the sixth world.  They are still a thing with most of the power they had before.  It's just corporations now have their own rights and laws within their land, essentially allowing them to say ""we get to have a military, too.""  Since many governments rely on those mega corporations for their supplies (like Ares for the latest firearms and combat vehicles, or Renraku and MCT for the latest in computer equipment and electricity), there's a sense of ""well, damn, the corps can shut us down if they engineered fake scarcity of resources"" amongst the governments.  Except where there's overlap, like Aztech/Aztlan.  Or self reliance, like much of the NAN (""who needs electricity?  Our ancestors will keep us safe until we can build our own generators"").  Governments still tax corporations, just like they always did.  And they still have anti-monopoly judgement power, just like they always did.  They're also just as corrupt as they are today, being paid off to vote in the ways that benefit the mega corps.    Plus ça change, as zeh say."
Shadowrun,3bxxgf,HowFortuitous,2,Fri Jul 3 15:20:56 2015 UTC,"That's good to know.  The main book reads like the govts exist in name only and the corps are the only real power.

The NAN used that to create the Treaty of Denver.  Could UCAS alphastrike the nation's of NAN? Yes. Would there be anything left worth having afterwards? Probably not."

The history I read mentioned nothing about NAN conquering other territories after that treaty.  I get their creation, I just can't wrap my mind around THAT MUCH TERRITORY when the ""war"" between them didnt' even escalate that much.  The Federation in Star Trek wouldn't sign a treaty that lopsided, and they sign treaties that make the Treaty of Versailles look reasonable."

Last time I checked, only one major city in the entire US sits on a city even close enough to one day form a volcano.     To use your own metaphor, Japan surrendered because we nuked two of their cities, not because we dropped it on a couple of random mountains.    And again, I get the surrender and treaty. I dont' argue any of that.  I just don't see how any government would turn over the majority of their country and why the original population of those states would just accept it without blinking.  Honestly at this point, it would have been more believable to have the UCAS surrender entirely and the whole damn country be one big NAN, because at least then, it would make a degree of sense."
Shadowrun,3bxxgf,Malkleth,7,Fri Jul 3 02:46:22 2015 UTC,"It's actually not as crazy as it sounds. For example for a small population like the United States to control so much land in the real world is actually anomaly. It's always been true that a dangerous and superior force can hold a lot of land.  But what you really got to look at is the land that UCAS actually gave up. Now I know this will piss some people off but the states in the US interior aren't huge economic drivers and don't have large populations. Hypothetically speaking those states are easy to give up. The hardest pills to swallow I imagine was ceding Oregon, Washington, Nevada, and Utah. Which are resource rich with large populations and strong economies. Even then though you see that the UCAS notably didn't want to give up their main western economic and population bases being California and the Seattle Metroplex which they wisely negotiated for. Shame that California seceded but that's life, eh?  Also if you want to see a country in real life that barely has anyone and just has sooooo much territory just look to Canada."

Those are ""fake SINs"" in Shadowrun.  The more you spend on it, the more valid and legit it will appear to checks. A Rating 1 SIN barely holds up, it's just a name and a number, like a fake ID kids get in school to try and buy beer. While a Rating 6 is pretty much a real SIN for all intents and purposes. The only difference is, if they get evidence you were at a crime scene, the home phone number and address listed is for Pizza Hut.  When you have a real SIN, and you leave evidence behind, they know it was YOU. They can contact your real family, your real employers (before you took to the shadows). They have your real DNA, your real magical aura imprint, your real high school yearbook photo to plaster everywhere on Wanted posters. That's why a real SIN is so dangerous. A single drop of blood left on the scene can lead them back to YOU. And especially if you tried faking your death before you took to the shadows, well now your secret is out."

A handy thing to do if you have a real SIN is to double up. get real licences for your gear (and then change out the barrels on your guns) and then get a high quality fake SIN and some fake licences. when off a run, broadcast the real SIN and licences, that way you could even use public transportation if you felt like it.

Shadowrun,3bvd72,arc_valor,20,Thu Jul 2 13:33:26 2015 UTC,"New License rule:  A license allows you to carry multiple Restricted items of Availability up to the license's rating, provided that gear is reasonably justified by the job on the license, and backed with the authority of a corporation or government who vouches for you in other jurisdictions and agrees to be held liable if you abuse it.  For instance, rather than buying licenses for a shotgun, sidearm, and a dart rifle, your character has a Rating 6 Paracritter Hunter license from the Salish-Sidhe Council.  This simplifies rolls at checkpoints and adds more roleplaying and world-building opportunities.  Rather then checking all five weapons individually, make one roll and spend the time you save ""talking shop"" about the job the character supposedly has, or reinforcing how the local security force feels about the organization that (supposedly) issued the licence.  (Although it is not intended to be used to track how dangerous/controlled gear is, in 4E the Availability rating maps closely to the power level of the item and works well as a guide in almost every situation.

I'd add that for two net hits player side, they could get access to some restricted equipment, and for three net hits, access for one trip to a Delta clinic. They have to pay cost, though.

Shadowrun,3bvd72,SmellyTofu,3,Thu Jul 2 14:48:29 2015 UTC,"I use this one too. The initial fixer is just such an important part of any usual campaign that it makes no sense to make one or all of your runners use up a contact resourse to get him. The guy provides access to equipment, guns, information, hiring NPC runners, jobs...I mean that is why he is a fixer. And as a lazy GM I don't want to have to make up four or five different characters and accents to handle all that crap one at a time.  The fixer usually becomes a fixture in the campaign as well. Probably the most memorable one in my group was Habib, who spoke in a gravely voice, smoked a hookah and interrupted conversation frequently to speak to someone on his push-button intercom. We used him for everything because it was much more fun to go through that character than it was to roll up hard-case shady goods seller #3.  How the fixer fits into the campaign should be different for each group though. Maybe the fixer knows everyone by name and rep and they have worked together before. Maybe he just saw 5 talented strangers and is playing matchmaker for a Johnson. Maybe he has a job that he can't turn turn down but is too hot for any one of his regular guys to take, so he pawns it off on some goons he couldn't care less about. Maybe all the players owe the fixer a big favor and he is calling it in.  Whatever the case I am all for including the free fixer, and leaving the runners to get a different contact that might add some variety to the game. Just that the fixer should be massaged into the campaign differently depending on the GM's goal and the players inclinations."

To be clear though, when I say I used PR2 I meant I have them doing 2 hits automatically on most tests. Not that they moved up stats-wise or gear-wise. I believe both the PR1 and PR2 examples have dicepools of 8 for most attacks, so that is 2-3 hits anyway on average.  The reason why gangers are afraid of the police isn't because each individual cop is a combat monster (who pops Jazz). It's because they have better gear, superior training and discipline, and have magical and drone support plus the entire city to back them up. So it'd be stupid to engage to cops because if you mess with one you mess with the entire city's police force. Usually. Hell, they may even call in SWAT or HTRs.   And since this is Shadowrun, the cops can even target whatever the gang's trying to protect. All those reasons and more are why gangs don't fight cops usually.

For some reason players consider them bad luck when I give them one.  Negotiation Tests, at the end of the opposed test if they get net hits I present them with a list of things they can ask for and they can get one per net hit. If the other side gets net hits I will add conditions or take things away. I may also offer some extra disadvantage for a bonus and they can choose to accept/deny it. I offer my players double contact points on the condition that the contacts are the group as a wholes contacts and not their contact. Some players with bigger contact pools divvy some up for themselves and putting the rest in the middle. If a single player gets a negative quality like Hung Out to Dry it affects both their contacts and the group as a wholes contacts. Players don't share in detail information about their characters prior to their contact allotments have been determined. For each other character included in a characters backstory I give the both of them a contact worth 6 points, divided as I chose. This works to a maximum of two times.  Double Free Knowledge points, with the amendment that only half can be spent on languages. Players can also pick something that the session involved and get one free rank of a knowledge skill. Roughly 10 Second Player Turn in Combat. Whiteboard of Infinite Knowledge, all scene information goes on the whiteboard. If I left something out that they somehow turn into something crucial (not stuff that isn't on there because they haven't noticed it(i.e. the bomb under the table)), I let them design some of it's parameters. Players after an action go to the whiteboard to adjust their own initiative score.  Players can cultivate Charisma Contacts each week. This breaks down into maintaining old ones and potentially making new ones. If a contact is not maintained in 7 months - loyalty months they lose a point of loyalty. They can also pay 2,000 nuyen to cultivate contacts in excess of their charisma.   I've also got countless minor adjustments to rules, equipment and yadda yadda but they aren't my favourites."

Shadowrun,3bvd72,Paddywagon123,2,Fri Jul 3 11:35:57 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually but we did use both the extremely crippling Street Scumpp.354 rules in a variety of full session playtests and the problem with low power games is force. If even one time an important encounter is blown away by a force 10+ summon that is against the entire purpose of playing in a lower power game.  What we found though is that people who are going to play mages or summoners though need to really understand the mechanics of those characters. Like they couldn't just roll a character with six sorcery and three magic and have a good time. That character now is rolling nine dice and if they made a character like that it's probably force three every time.  The players who really understood the limits though. Would specialize their skill, grab an appropriate force two foci, a mentor spirit, and frequently overcasting to get those force six spells. Those players showed that you can play a mage with three magic and still be chuckin 12+ dice on average and doing lots of damage and having lots utility.  So in summary yeah I think we might try sum of eight but we're pretty happy with the above rule set. It has done everything we wanted to do with the system and interestingly is still making characters just using the regular priorities. So if a person wanted to they actually could take the character into another regular Shadowrunning game and the character would probably be completely legal. (Except the extra six karma we give for bonded foci. So... hypothetically that player would just scratch that and be able to go and play)"

What I have done are Let's Plays and streams of video games. Here are some audio tips I've picked up through troubleshooting that:   As far as equipment goes (and you've probably figured this bit out), one of the best budget mic makers I've seen are the folks at Blue Yeti. They're not exactly cheap, but they're at the low end of the price spectrum for good, quality microphones. Something that you should absolutely get is a pop filter. It will inevitably happen that you will say a hard ""P"" sound that will just turn into a horrible ear-splitting explosion on the mic, and those help that immensely. They are typically pretty cheap, and indispensable once you hear the difference in a sentence with a lot of hard ""P"" sounds. You're likely going to have to do some playing around with the ""studio space"" and microphone placement before you get everyone's levels right if you're recording with more than one person. And by ""some playing around"" I mean a few hours of testing, listening, moving around, rearranging stuff, rinse and repeat, until you get everyone to a hearable level. When trying to do a Let's Play with 5-6 people, I ran into the issue that we all had very different ""normal"" talking voice volume, where I would overpower most everyone else in volume(partly 'cause I'm the extorvert, partly 'cause I'm going deaf slowly but surely). Audio is very complicated once you get in depth, and no number of tips will really replace a study of audio equipment and how sound travels through electricity.   I sincerely wish you the best of luck. Podcasting is something I never got too into making (as I tend to be too ADD to stick to a topic through something that long) but I enjoy listening to them."

Shadowrun,3bwl4r,Charlie24601,3,Fri Jul 3 10:19:26 2015 UTC,"5e doesn't run on logic.  it runs on poorly thought-out rules designed for 'balance' not 'verisimilitude'.  You could say that a shock glove relies on constant contact for a period to discharge, which a punch does not give (the impact throws the target away from the contacts of the glove before enough time has elapsed to shock them much).  And that the grappling techniques that do damage would have too great a chance to shock the character as well if he activated the shock glove while also grappling them.  But the actual explanation is 'it's written that way as a poor means of stopping people adding taser damage to death punches'."
Shadowrun,3bwl4r,rejakor,2,Fri Jul 3 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"The rules for shock gloves are based on the idea that you don't punch, so much as slap the target.  Look at page 187 for touch-only attack.  You get +2 dice and in a tie the attacker wins.  You just need to make contact, not necessarily solid contact, for the glove to do its thing.    As others have mentioned, the most sensible location for the contacts to be is the palm or insides of the fingers (since the outside of your hand gets scraped and banged the most).  The entry for the shock gloves does include ""punch"" as an option though.  It doesn't make sense though from a balance point of view to allow a punch to also do a secondary stun attack.  The punch would just be a ""touch vector"" to deliver the shock through knuckle contacts, I would guess."
Shadowrun,3bwl4r,Feynt,2,Fri Jul 3 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"Let him try a slap (not punch) that powerful, allow it, but tell him he busted the contacts up and it ain't electrocuting anyone afterwards. If they are hit with force, they will likely break.  If you did it, don't allow him to have the +2 for contact attack.  Punching with a shock glove is probably not the way they are intended. The contacts for electrocution are probably on the palm and inside of his fingers.   It would also be awesome to yell, ""bitch, please!"" as he did it."
Shadowrun,3bwl4r,shaninator,4,Fri Jul 3 05:29:24 2015 UTC,You can make 1 attack action a turn.  Think about how much damage that 12p would do to the glove itself. Probably would get destroyed in the process if you tried to activate it at the same time.  You may deal shock glove damage or you may deal punch damage. You may not deal both with a single test.
Shadowrun,3bwl4r,Bamce,5,Thu Jul 2 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"A couple of contact points, and some wiring. That's all there really needs to be to make Shock Gloves work. So there's no need to nitpick damaging your clothing by being too awesome to wear it.  I think /u/Boojum2k's explanation is far more plausible. The gloves are simply not designed to deliver the shock in the same way. Having the contacts on the inside prevents punching damage without saying ""Oh look, you broke your gloves."""
Shadowrun,3bwl4r,marcus_gideon,2,Thu Jul 2 20:27:14 2015 UTC,That is not to say you can't get a device or spell that converts your attack to electrical damage. It just means that stock shock gloves don't work that way.

Personally, I mostly see the bonus a broadcasting legitimate brand tags, which in the hyper-consumerist dystopia of shadowrun, is enough to give you a social advantage (similar to Reach on a melee weapon).  I'd let it pass, personally. Having a bunch of invisible digital fashionistas constantly leaving AR arcs for optimal presentation (don't bend further than this, keep your hands this far to present your rad cuff links but not show too much shirt, ) and similar info from others, stress levels, etc. Could justify a teanwork bonus."

If it's just a matter of broadcasting name brands, anybody could Spoof their way into the Ritz. Like wearing an ""Armani"" plastic trash bag. And if a name tag broadcast is worth +4 Social, then the world is FAR more petty than I've been led to believe. I should be able to repel elite socialites just by brandishing a store brand hot dog menacingly.

A full-color half-page piece nets the artist about as much as ten thousand words nets a writer (So, you know, a picture is actually worth ten THOUSAND words!), roughly, about, more or less, ish, ly.   .

You can’t sustain Complex Forms when you’re unconscious.""    Only difference i can see is that this entry says all actions and mage sustaining says all tests.

Shadowrun,3bulbh,Hedshodd,2,Thu Jul 2 23:14:08 2015 UTC,"No, penalties like these don't effect damage reistance (of any kind). The way SR5 words things like these is that they tell you explicitely, when modifiers apply. When you look look up damage resistance (p. 173, crb) and drain resistance (p. 278 & 282, crb), it doesn't tell you to apply modifiers, so you shouldn't.   This has been a general rule for a long time, especially concerning damage resistance: Unless a modifier explicitely says that it effects damage resistance, it doesn't. That's because damage resistance tests don't tell you to apply modifiers (outside of armor penetration), while other skill tests do. Basically a test and damage resistance are two different things and need to be treated differently. The fluff reason for that is that modifiers are things that influence your concentration. You get that penalty from sustaining spells, because you need some minor concentration to keep it sustained (otherwise it would be a permanent spell). But not getting hit as hard does not need concentration, you just resist it. It also has balance reasons, because shadowrun can be fairly lethal as is :D  Edit: As /u/Shirck pointed out, reducing the associated soak attribute obviously reduces the soak pool (like reducing body, and thus reducing physical soak)."
Shadowrun,3bulbh,MrFoxington,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:39:08 2015 UTC,"A nice way to considered these sorts of situations is that ""can't > can""  and ""explicit > general"". Which is what you seemed to be referring to.   In the current situation it is a ""general can"" situation (sustained spell modifier to all tests) against the ""general can't"" situation (don't apply modifiers to damage resistance tests).  If however the sustaining modifier stated it can modify the damage resistance test then it's ""explicit can"" trumps the ""general can't"".   Is a neat little rule of thumb."

Shadowrun,3bu64c,BitRunr,3,Thu Jul 2 05:27:51 2015 UTC,"A few reasons: 1) Needless rule bloat.  Gone 4eds without them, never once felt an urge to include anything like it.  At my table they just add another rule to track.  I see what the point was with Magic force ratings in 4e, but forcing them on every roll is too far.  Hardwiring them to weapon accuracy in particular is a good example of a direction I would feel better handled by a simpler -1/+1 die type mechanic to reflect quality. 2) Pointless in terms of numerics, as Chummer5 mentions above.  Example: Matrix limits seem the most useless, since as I read it, you can just change them every round. 3) They feel like punishments towards players who get that one really good roll.  My groups love that random, totally improbable event where 6s explode out to infinity or you otherwise do way better than you would have any reason to expect.  Taking that moment away, even in potential, takes away an opportunity for fun at the table.  If I have a player who manages to stack 20 dice up, and makes 16 hits outta nowhere, that's a big moment I have no problem providing.  Jacking 8 of those just because the book tells me to pokes a hole in that ""woo hoo"" moment for no reason.  Moreover, that player knows it's coming, and the sail never gets past half mast.  Pass."
Shadowrun,3bu64c,BitRunr,5,Thu Jul 2 05:52:11 2015 UTC,"1) minor dice bonuses / penalties stack up, and can individually be almost meaningless in the face of a large dice pool.  2) I think they should have been lower to counter that opinion.  3) Edge is Luck, measured and ranked. If you want to take advantage of lucky dice rolls, spend Edge & ignore limits."

Before you start trying to figure out how to make the toon, you should decide what the toon is going to be first."
Shadowrun,3bs07z,marcus_gideon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:19:43 2015 UTC,"You can still make a gang of Machine Sprites and assign them to your drones.   SR5 machine sprites do not have any skills for handling drones or vehicles though. You could use them to run Diagnostic on the machine to get the bonus though.   Using Control Device to take command works almost as well as a Control Rig would.   Only if you are handling single machine. Also you need the appropriate skills and attributes, something to keep in mind because decent Living Persona is already attribute demanding."
Shadowrun,3bs07z,marcus_gideon,2,Wed Jul 1 21:10:32 2015 UTC,"1) Correct. Machine Sprites are worth their bit-length in gold when it comes to Diagnostics. If you don't need Sprites for anything else, having a slew of Machine Sprites running Diagnostics on team toys is awesomesauce.  2) The mechanical effects of a Control Rig (what makes a Rigger a Rigger, instead of just a drone user) is a few extra dice, and biofeedback from drone damage. While using Control Device lets you do everything the Rigger could, without the feedback. The fun stuff with drones, like giving a single command to the entire swarm, comes from owning an RCC. So as a TM, you just buy an RCC and network the drones through it. Now you can command them all at once, or operate them individually. The only thing you're lacking is the ability to Jump In.  If you're making a Techno-Rigger, then you should be skilling as a Rigger. The TM stuff ""comes naturally"" just from making the character. So you should have all the same Gunnery and Pilot Craft stuff that a Rigger would anyway."

Shadowrun,3bss89,fanoren,2,Wed Jul 1 21:17:37 2015 UTC,"Here's something I wrote that got saved on the wiki. But that's for a hacking duel, what about more every day things, like hacking that camera?  Well if you're hacking a camera that is wireless, all too easy. It won't be running silent, so you'll automatically be able to spot it if you are in X yards of it (the exact distance is in the matrix rules). So you want to stick a mark on it so you can do stuff. It's got a measly 6 dice to defend itself from the big scary decker, the decker is fairly optimal and is throwing around 16 dice. Decker gets 3 net hits and gets his mark.   He can then use a matrix action called edit file to look through the camera and change what he sees (requiring an edit check every combat round if he's removing the team from view) or brick it shutting down the camera entirely and possibly setting off alarms or whatever.  What if it's not wireless? Well drek omae... how did you hack things before we had this glorious wireless? Well we found some of the wiring and jacked ourselves in... Bingo, SR5 has this thing called a data tap for exactly this purpose. Once you are directly connected you just repeat the same process as you would a wireless camera.  If these cameras were connected to a Host you'd also get a mark on the Host. What does that mean? It means you could enter the Host. Hosts are big things that connect all the stuff a building will have under one server. So the data files, doors, cameras, fire alarm, drones and so much more can be accessed from here... So naturally this is something the decker will want to get into, as once you are in you can literally open doors for your team.   Different actions require different amounts of marks, but you'll pretty much never need more than 3 marks on anything, unless it's an owner only action in which case no matter how good of a hacker you are you can't do it."

And thankfully there is an...out of character agreement with everyone that you DON'T turn on the party. We've all been working together in-game for a few years and have been through hell and back so we're just saying that even if me and another player have been turned into monsters (it's not ghoulism it's a different strain) they're not  gonna kill us.

HMHVV shows up relatively easily, (3 hits shows diseases) while blood magic is just going to be in their faces no matter how you spin it.   The use of blood magic will show up in their aura, which has a strongly negative effect on any who assense them (excepting other blood mages)."
Shadowrun,3bskv8,falarransted,6,Wed Jul 1 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"Nah. It is just one new method of noise reduction.  Considering you can explicitly stack datajacks, and more to the point fresnel fabric exists, there is no real need for an antenna."
Shadowrun,3bskv8,dezzmont,2,Wed Jul 1 20:45:35 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to figure out the mechanics of this, but the implication is that fresnel fabric + sat uplink means you can have 0 noise everywhere on earth."
Shadowrun,3bskv8,xcbsmith,3,Thu Jul 2 01:50:09 2015 UTC,"I believe Satilite uplink procs last.  Furthermore there can be noise from multiple sources.  However for almost any hack, even using smoke and mirriors, fabric is enough."
Shadowrun,3bskv8,dezzmont,2,Thu Jul 2 02:15:22 2015 UTC,"I believe Satilite uplink procs last.   So that seems odd. Is the idea that the uplink already does all the NR that is possible?   Furthermore there can be noise from multiple sources.   Sorry, I meant ""no noise penalty due to distance"", because yeah, obviously. ;-)"
Shadowrun,3bskv8,xcbsmith,2,Thu Jul 2 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"The way I've always looked at it...  You could measure the total Noise between the antenna in your cell phone / Commlink / Cyberdeck, all the way around the world to someone else's cell phone / Commlink / Cyberdeck... and come up with some kind of ridiculous number. From there, you start adding in antennas and Fresnel fabric to try and tune in the signal a little better. Then you add in a (single) Datajack to clean up that signal a little bit. Maybe you're running a Signal Scrub to get it even cleaner still. But in the end, you're doing the best you can with your built in antenna talking to another antenna clear around the globe.  Or... you plug in a Sat Link, which bypasses your antenna entirely. Now you're receiving a direct signal from the satellite network, which is relaying through the closest proximity sat relay to the target. There's no static on the line for your Signal Scrub or whatever to clean up. The only thing you're up against is the latency of the connection. And there's no way to get around latency, except proximity. And if you were close enough to avoid latency, you wouldn't be using the Sat Link to begin with.  Hence... why Noise Reductions don't apply to Sat Links. =)"
Shadowrun,3bskv8,marcus_gideon,2,Thu Jul 2 03:38:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think that Data Jacks should stack. Since it's kinda like having a USB port in your neck... the fact that I have 6x USB ports on my PC doesn't make it read a single thumb drive any faster than just having 1x USB port. The extras just let me plug in more things, not run a single thing better. Now if you wanted unhindered direct connection to multiple devices,  you could get a Datajack for each. But that just seems wasteful to me."
Shadowrun,3bskv8,marcus_gideon,3,Wed Jul 1 21:12:51 2015 UTC,"Data jacks seem like they should be renamed. Since it gives WiFi, I think of it more as a router with an internal antenna, with the cord being a secondary option.

They have enough processing power to handle DNI, which is why some BTLs only need to be slotted into your Datajack to work. But you can't get online using only a Datajack.

The program is free, so long as you don't expect to save or print. So basically you make the toon, and then hand jam onto paper or something. But it will track all the math and stuff for you.   It also makes it very easy to rearrange Priorities and see if there isn't a better way to get where you're going.

So, a matrix quarantine could be set up to accomplish the lockdown.  Now, I was in favor of a permadeath game but oh how people railed against that.  So there had to be a way to respawn.  So I suggested that the nanites could store ""you"" and re-emerge inside of a clone.  Some people take their immortality lightly and soon you've got people doing crazy stuff.

After that I got with to the armored car with him, to check my SIN and other documents. When he was occupied, I used my palm pistol and shoot him right in the face. Poor bastard never stood a chance.

Shadowrun,3bpp3h,Thanes_of_Danes,3,Wed Jul 1 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"Well there's a few ways to boost your agility depending on what you like:  Augmentations to boost muscles can provide buffs to agility  Cyberarms can offer enhanced agility and have the potential for a cool character look  A mage has spells they can use to buff agility (you could play a rare low magic mage who focuses exclusively on sustaining buffs)  Adepts can raise their skills and attributes very high, making them a good choice for a gunslinger  So what sounds most like the character you want omae?"
Shadowrun,3bpp3h,felicidefangfan,3,Wed Jul 1 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"Adept sounds pretty promising and seemed like what others online went with pretty often, Augs is what I was taking a look at but they are mighty expensive and we're street level starting.

Improved Accuracy (Pistols) - Because you'll be throwing around 15 dice without a smart link extra accuracy will be worth it.  Improved Sense (Vision Magnification)    Not necessarily the best combination of stuff but should get you by."
Shadowrun,3bpp3h,Valanthos,2,Wed Jul 1 05:31:25 2015 UTC,Considering the street level dip in cash and resources would you suggest Dual wielding and modifying weapons at all? I could smart link a War Hawk for relatively cheap.
Shadowrun,3bpp3h,Mittensworth,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:37:27 2015 UTC,"Dual wielding is generally a bad choice in SR. Smartlinking your Warhawk and giving yourself some goggles with smartlink stuff gives you a bonus one dice in shooting stuff, almost certainly worth it.  With 6,000 nuyen you can stretch your budget around the basics. NotB0b wrote a guide not long back about how to do it. You are required to spend a little of your karma on getting yourself some more nuyen."
Shadowrun,3bpp3h,ChromeEagle,2,Wed Jul 1 05:53:42 2015 UTC,If not dual wielding though wouldn't it be a better option to forgo the Warhawk for the one revolver from run & gun I believe I can't recall the name but the slightly less powerful SA shot revolver over the SS.
Shadowrun,3bpp3h,Valanthos,3,Wed Jul 1 06:12:04 2015 UTC,"Revolvers are almost a universally bad decision because they don't have many shots. You end up reloading too much if you do anything more than SS. And reloading is time that you could better spend filling someone with holes.  Maybe consider, I hate to say this, but some of the more modern pistol designs. The Savalette Guardian is a fine pistol if you really want the edge in combat."

Shadowrun,3bpp3h,xcbsmith,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:49:54 2015 UTC,Bear in mind you don't have to always fire both pistols. I think that is the key. But having 2 ready to go opens up a good option. I think splitting your dice pool works best when you spend Edge and one or both of your targets are already quite injured. It's a good way to finish someone off and still have a chance to hit a fresh target.

It allows you to fire with your off hand without penalty so you can have two guns readied and alternate firing between left and right and double your ammo pool, which is a big limiting factor with revolvers."
Shadowrun,3bpp3h,thepsyborg,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:32:25 2015 UTC,"What does street level mean?  Because honestly, for a game where the PCs are not established pros, there should be a cap on magic.  Otherwise, you might still operate on the streets, but you are a big fish in a small pond.  By the time you develop magic rating 6 and the potential to fully use it, you aren't really street level - you've had rare and valuable training.  The training is available on the streets, but not any more commonly than a high end deck or some such.  Software (and hardware) is much easier to steal than magic."

Shadowrun,3bpp3h,velocity219e,2,Wed Jul 1 05:18:11 2015 UTC,"All elves can certainly be fantasy-cliche-hell, but on the other hand it can also be a really cool option to play something along the lines of an elven gang with loose ties to the Ancients (maybe take a low- to mid-level Ancient as a contact, maybe you're all adult professionals now but you were all part of the same street gang as kids/teenagers and have some child contacts for information in particular neighborhoods, something). Basically, all elves is something with potential to be awesome if you talk to your group and tie your backstories together to some extent (it needn't be all sunshine and roses, either; plenty of room for persistent rivalries even if you've all known each other since you were kids).  If you're not working with the party on some sort of group origin, then yeah, all elves is a little bit lame, but racial prejudices are an entirely reasonable explanation for such a cliche-fest if you're cool with RPing that particular variety of asshattery.  You should always have a pistol. You should never rely on your pistol.  You always want to have at least one thing you can do reasonably well in a fight and one thing you can do reasonably well in planning runs and getting information, so don't neglect your social skills too badly, especially if you decide to go elf.

Shadowrun,3bpp3h,Haroshia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:31:46 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend getting a Specialization for your Pistols skill, perhaps Revolvers. You will also want some kind of Smartlink. You can add one to contact lenses or glasses/sunglasses for a non adept/mage/shaman, or you can get it installed in your Cybereyes otherwise. These two additions to your  character will be quite helpful.  Having some kind of Initiative boost is ideal. You can get that from adept powers or from ware. If you do play an Adept I'd advise not taking any ware at all.  Investing in APDS rounds and a Quick Draw Holster would be wise investments as well. Keep in mind too that all races can be a good Gunslinger, they just have different pros and cons. A Troll for example can soak up tons of damage and reign pistol fire for days without breaking a sweat.  Most likely though you would want either Human or Ork since they're less expensive, which means you'll have a higher Edge."
Shadowrun,3bpp3h,Hedshodd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:37:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume Chrome Flesh isn't in play.  If it is, there are ways you can make this worse.  Chrome Flesh added a LOT more low essence options to beef up your pool without dropping you more than 1 magic point.  This is coming from a purely ""Throw more dice fuck the police"" Standpoint, so take it with a grain of salt.  1) Don't be an elf.  Be a human with 5 edge.  Edge is great for everything.  2) Be an adept.  Basically every street sam type character should be an adept if possible.  Mundanes are completely inferior to adepts with a little ware.  3)  Get muscle toners (bioware) and cyber eyes.  The toners add agility dice for very little essence, and the eyes let you get a few more bonus dice from Smartlink.  If you get used toners and decent eyes, you can keep your total essence loss below one point.  If Chrome Flesh is allowed, look at the gene mods and other things instead of Cyber Eyes.  DO NOT TAKE IMPROVED PHYSICAL ABILITY IT IS A TRAP.  Power points are far better spent elsewhere than a whole power point for a single point of agility that you can boost way higher with some ware.  4) For qualities you have some options.  Personally I like the combo of Strive for Perfection (Called shots have half penalty, but you HAVE to take called shots if possible) and Sharpshooter (Called shots penalty reduced by 2).  I'll elaborate why later.  5) For adept powers, your staples are going to be Improved Reflexes (at least 2), and Rapid Draw.  You should have a couple power points left over to put into other things if you like.    6) Look over the Called Shots to specific body parts from Run and Gun.  Notice shooting somebody's shin off prevents them from taking complex actions which makes a melee character utterly useless.  Notice blowing arms off makes them unable to use that arm, which means they'll be trying to fire an assault rifle one handed.  Notice shooting them in the neck or sternum blows for them and pretty much takes them out of the fight.  Notice that using the Shake Up called shot does full damage AND makes them lose 5 initiative.  If you took the Sharpshooter and Strive for Perfection qualities, you can be doing the really tough shots (eye, sternum, ear) for a mere -3 or -4 (depending on how your GM does the math) instead of at a -10.  The -6 and -4 called shots could be reduced to -1 and -2 as well.  Basically, called shots are love, called shots are life.  7) If you have SOME karma left over, take a martial art that has ""tricking"" in it.  Talk to your GM and see if he'll let you consider doing the Revolver Ocelot gun spins as ""tricking"" instead of having to take trick shots.  He should if he's cool.  8) Run until you find a guy who shoots you.  Tell him he's pretty good."

Ciaphas Cain and Inquisitor Vail) It's a lineage-based feudal structure, so often romance is replaced by obligation, and the bigger-than-life, barely human nature of the setting's main actors make it relatively irrelevant to begin with. It's just a ""normal human thing"".  It becomes more visible when you start reading the logistic stuff, or about life in Hives, but in general, the lack of focus on anything ""human"" is because, well, almost nothing is.

(What, you thought the ""Mr Porcupine"" reference in the fluff didn't have a launching pad?)  .  My goal was to try and port everything from Augmentation over from 4th to 5th (With several bits having already been in the 5E core book), then adding a bunch more. I added -roughly- as many things as where in the previous edition, give or take. Cybergenitals are a legacy thing. I claim no (well, limited) reponsibility for 'em. They were in 4th ed Augmentation, so they go in 5th.   .  Now, I did add the low-tech version, and mentioned the bioware, but those were for a simple reason: Pushing the ""Beautiful People"" aspect of the upper class more into perspective. Forty years ago, Joan Rivers used to get raked over the coals for having plastic surgery, but by 2010, people were openly discussing their proceedures on TV and the idea of not having your teeth redone, bright white, and have flawless skin ... well, nobody goes natural.   .  The Bio-Scultping culture pushes that further, to the point that it's absoultely normal for almost everyone to 'get work done' and, in many cases, is covered under employment medical insurance. I wasn't quite able to get where I wanted on Bioware Bundles (But they'll exist at some point!), but a ""Sweet Sixteen"" design, with a fat reduction, nose job, lip boost, eye perfecting, hair change, dietware, clean metabolism, silky skin, and breast augmentation was considered completely normal for a corp kid.   .  Feel free to push back against this in-character, of course. STreet scum tend to look like real people, rather than corporate refined and bio-scultped gliteratti, and playing up the dichotomy between the 'fair folk' and the normal schlubs is a classic Shadowrun feature.   .

You don't have to include things just because they were from a previous edition, you've proven that time and time again with 5th you are breaking exciting new ground all the time.  That said I appreciate you are doing your job and it probably made more sense to include it than not write it down so you didn't have a different angry mob after you. I'm not even mad about cyberdongs, I'm just upset that they made the cut and some other stuff didn't.  (P.S.

As an aside, there is a metamagic that used to only be for possession traditions that allowed you to retain control but get boosted stats from the spirit, but as far as I know that works for all traditions now for some reason."

I like to get around this at my table (and sneak in a ton of easy exposition) by reminding the players of things that the characters should already know.  For instance, when the team walked into a room full of oblivious jacked-in office drones, it was the cyberork who recognized the smell of an anti-necrotic gel used to prevent implant rejection following extreme cybermodification.  As always, try to make it fun - if someone has a knowledge or background that applies, use them as a mouthpiece to move the story forward while making their character important.  Don't let a lack of character knowledge stop the game, but sometimes giving the characters bad intel because of a failed roll can be hilarious.  ""Seriously, I thought Trolls could regenerate!"" ""What the hell, Dave.""  In other words, it's up to the GM to declare what the characters do or do not know, and it's a good idea to remember that the GM trumps canon when it serves the story."

Your Sammie is also your locksmith when you find a maglocked door with a hardwired system the decker can't get into.  Your Sammie is the guy who sets up everybodies ropes and assent gear(i.e. teamwork gymnastics) so your mage doesn't fall 40 stories to his death while climbing a building.  Your Sammie the guy who can best sneak past a guard you can't compromise to get the decker a direct connection to the goods.
Shadowrun,3bny86,PinkTrench,9,Tue Jun 30 19:33:08 2015 UTC,"Couple of reasons.   You're not always working against corps. Could be gangers, or organized crime, or even just small companies who have less resources to track you down. If you destroy a lot of their assets, yeah, the corp will hunt you down. But there are a myriad of ways to cover your tracks after a firefight, so unless you actually destroyed the building or eliminated a small army of corpsec officers, they're eventually going to get frustrated and give up. There comes a point where the cost of the search and destroy operation is greater than the morale and reputation boost that you would get from it, and the only reason shadowrunners can do business is that they usually stay on the far side of that line. Corp forces can't operate everywhere. If you're hiding on territory owned by another mega, they can't get at you (until you leave, or unless you really pissed them off).   Basically it comes down to being clever with your violence. If you want to get away with it, you use nonlethals primarily, wipe the cameras and laes the witnesses, scramble the astral signatures, and then pray to God that your case isn't handled to the sort of manager who takes things personally. The combat characters usually only come into play when things go sideways, but when you need 'em you'll really need 'em."

Shadowrun,3bny86,Geeked1,3,Thu Jul 2 01:00:58 2015 UTC,"The best part about playing Shadowrun, is that you could be doing anything from one game to the next. You may be hired to infiltrate a high rise office building and steal files off the CEO's personal terminal. You may be breaking into a warehouse and stealing prototype tech. You may be exploring newly discovered ruins searching for magical artifacts.  When my group started out, we had a Mage, a Rigger, a Sam, and a TM. The missions were actually quite varied, since the Rigger's drones could help supplement the Sam if we needed heavy ordnance. Under the hood of the Rigger's van was a machine gun with explosive ammo, which we nicknamed ""Plan B"". So if things started to go south on a run, we'd just get on the radio and say ""Time for Plan B"" =)  Something really important to keep in mind about YOUR table and YOUR team, is that the game will be whatever YOU want it to be. The easiest way to get a team started on missions is to give them a common Fixer. The Fixer is like a Hollywood agent, they get phone calls all day long asking for teams. If your team is a bunch of Mages, then he's going to send the magical crises your way. If your team is a bunch of eggheads, he's going to send all the cerebral stuff instead. If your team is a bunch of gun bunnies, he's not going to send you on Corp espionage runs, he's going to send you places where the body count doesn't matter so long as the goods are secure by the end.  So if your players want to all be Sams, then just roll with it."
Shadowrun,3bny86,marcus_gideon,5,Tue Jun 30 20:21:21 2015 UTC,"The first thing to remember is that there is no ""one true Shadowrun campaign"" - every table is going to be a little different.  Old timers will describe campaigns as falling somewhere on a spectrum of ""Pink Mohawk"" to ""Mirrorshades"", in terms of how subtle your characters are.  There's a place for the deranged mutants in Shadowrun, but it's probably not infiltrating a shareholder's meeting, you know?  So, if your campaign is intended to be serious, the violent nutjobs are probably going to be sidelined.  That said, lots of combat types are incredibly useful - as /u/fastwalker0 pointed out, no plan survives contact with the enemy.  If the decker drops the ball and you get pinned down by the local rent-a-cops, you're going to need to make a hard exit.  Trust me, the only thing that will end worse for you then hanging around for the Heavy Response Teams is getting taken alive.  Ever wonder where all of those test subjects come from?  If you're curious how to make a combat character work in a mostly non-combat game, I strongly suggest you make time to catch a few episodes of Leverage. The premise is that a team of master criminals decide to take on the rich and powerful, and it's almost perfectly Shadowrun. (Looks like it's streaming on Netflix and Hulu.)"

It was a thing of beauty and everyone was equally surprised how well it went.  All other missions were disasters in-terms of being subtle due to bad rolls.  I highly recommend you and your friends, especially the GM, get familiar with the world of Shadowrun.  Luckily, we're all here to help each other out.  So feel free to ask additional questions.  Don't forget your players need to make sure they have a well-rounded team to survive.  That includes:   Matrix - computer support to hack, crash, steal and/or control devices and objects in cyberspace and meatspace Magic - more for support than damage dealing, like spirits (bread-n-butter), invisibility, increase stats, control mind, levitate, etc. Transportation - gotta have wheels (more than a scooter) Damage Dealers - guns, knives, fists, cream pies, etc. Support - medical, eyes-n-ears (drones), etc.   Each team member plays a vital role.

Because the corps tend to try to frag you up regardless.  Combat runners are technically there for defense.  If the corp sends armed dudes at you, you're in your right to defend yourself. If you barge in and start slaughtering their staff, then that's terrorism.  It's a delicate balancing act. But that's why non-lethal professionals are better appreciated.  Lastly,  You might actually be hired to cause damage, too. But then you're hired to cause damage. That's different in intent. In that case you're the tool used by the rival corporation, not the perpetrator.   TL;DR   It all depends on the operating parameters. The corps follow a certain unwritten law, like criminal organisations (the ""game""). It's a complex thing, but it makes sense when you see it from their POV."

Shadowrun,3bny86,Roxfall,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"One of the big things the books seem to stretch is that the Corps really dont like it when you destroy any of their assets such as security and will go to insane lengths to track down that destroyer and odds are they will catch them.    This is a massive massive massive lie and the books go to great lengths to paint this as untrue.  Corps absolutely do not care about anything besides money. Even S-K, a corp that is run by a prideful dragon, actively likes you better when you make them look the fool as powerful metahumans who can defy him are the only thing Lofwyr likes.  Corporations do not gain anything by hunting you down, even if you left fingerprints all over the scene and were caught on camera at 5 different angles. As a SINless shadow operative, they also understand that hunting you down would be extremely extremely expensive.  Thus, most shadowrunners try to force corps to play to cost effectiveness rather than making it impossible for them to be hunted down. While it would be a trivial expendature of resources for a corp to hunt down a runner, it would bankrupt corporations to hunt down every runner.  The reason you should avoid slaughtering people is because it creates internal pressure on the corporation to hunt you down. An individual murder of some onsite security will not come back to bite you as long as you don't make it extremely easy for the corp to find you (such as the 5 camera anles and fingerprints scenario) where as no one cares at all if you gun down HTR. But if you slit the throat of the entire security team and get caught on camera doing it you are in for a bad time as the number crunchers factor in the morale boost to the wageslaves in the profit margins from catching you. This is why you use non-lethal when possible, because killing turns a ""thank god you are alright! I was so worried and scared"" into a ""I hope the bosses catch the bastard who did this to you...""    Here is the dirty secret that validates the existence of samurai and adepts.  People saying combat should never be part of plan A? Are correct. Combat is messy and chaotic and, most importantly, implies the enemy will be meaningfully resisting you. Combat is a soft failure state that should only happen when some other role badly messes up.  Violence can be plan A. Violence often must be plan A in fact. A lot of people act like a ghost run is the default but due to the nature of magical security making a perfect ghost run is actually impossible on many many facilities. As soon as you must bypass a spirit you have a decent chance of being forced to blitz the facility you are hitting, especially if the spirit is at a checkpoint rather than patrolling. There is no way for a mage to bypass that spirit, banishing it or destroying it alerts the mage who controls it instantly which in turn generally alerts whereever you are. This means once spirits show up samruai need to plan to break the spine on the facility they are hitting.  The key to using violence effectively on a run is to use it like any other tool your team has. You don't rush in and start slinging spells in the astral as a mage while people sling back, hackers hitting a host try to avoid ICE rather than beating it down, and when the Samurai feels like it is time to crack the spine of the facility you are hitting, they don't just stride into a room and start shooting randomly. Use it with tact and intellect to accomplish your goals.  Violence should be surgical. Samurai have such a massive advantage over their average target that they should be able to eliminate 2-3 enemies in a single turn, perhaps even pass, without getting hit as long as the target lacks cover or forewarning. This means that a clever samurai could take out all opposition in a single turn, allowing the team to just waltz around the facility and grab whatever they were after while HTR takes its sweet time getting to your location.  Samurai also form a defensive tool, as a failed face, mage, or hacker can often result in an instant alert to any facility you are hitting, and statistically will happen if the facility is even worth your time. Most runs are not an effort to ghost it the whole way so much as an attempt to make as much progress as possible before going loud. Once things go loud, a good samurai will attempt to defend their team by eliminating threats agressively and using their superior stats to keep enemies at bay. Anyone charging a samurai in cover is probably going to die or get stunned in a single attack.  Finally, samurai tend to be better at more than just killing, as the role leaves a lot of stats and skills open for sub-specialties, which is why samurai is the most commonly spliced role in the game, often with face, decker, or rigger. Even if you are only going for str, bod, and agi, you are going to have plenty of skills left over. Samurai with high agility and str are so good at sneaking, lockpicking, and gymnastics that the infiltrator 'role' is essentially not a role, so much as an aspect of the face and samurai roles. Samurai have superhuman mobility and have more than double sneaking dice on most corpsec."

Shadowrun,3bp6g5,PinkTrench,3,Wed Jul 1 02:24:38 2015 UTC,I think that's what it should do. Just act as extra Matrix condition monitor. You need to brick the router before you can hack the other cyber.

Shadowrun,3bp6g5,WizardWolf,3,Wed Jul 1 18:47:49 2015 UTC,"The internal router is perhaps the single most mind boggling piece of ware introduced in Chrome Flesh. From the discussions I've read, early on in 5e's design it was decided to implement wireless bonuses as a way to force characters to give the decker something with which to interact. When the core book first came out these wireless bonuses were one of the most hotly contested issues in debating the merits of the 5e. It was speculated by some that the reason skinlink was left out so many times was because it offered a way around forcing things to turn on wireless.   And now finally we've been given a single piece of gear that eliminates the need for wireless in a wide swathe of gear in perhaps the most confusing manner possible. There are very few pieces of gear that openly state whether their wireless connections are used for the purposes of connecting to ""an outside network""   All of the following are actual wireless bonuses, and it is damn near impossible to tell which need an outside network:    +1 dice pool bonus to Social Tests Increase Social Limit by 3 for Intimidation Tests +1 on all Survival Tests in hot terrain You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI the suit uses the extra information about your surroundings and also gives you a +2 dice pool bonus to Sneaking Tests for hiding Add the vision enhancement’s rating as a dice pool modifier to your visual Perception Tests.   What we have here is a colossal reversal in the way the system was seemingly designed on top of unclear implementation."
Shadowrun,3bp6g5,MrPierson,2,Wed Jul 1 05:13:33 2015 UTC,"There are a score or more of wireless boni out there, and more will come from every book. Rather than list each and every one in a one-case format, a blanket rule makes life easy. In this case, ""Stuff inside your body can now talk to one another. So, for example, you can open your smuggling compartment as a free action with this installed.  Accessing information OUTSIDE of your body, such as downloading a new Active Soft, or getting weather information for your Smartgun, is something that this CANNOT do.""  .  So, it falls into the GM's call as to which bonuses need outside access to work, and this list will have to be expanded as new things are invented. Obviously, the INTERNAL router can't wirelessly command your grenades to explode off in the distance. It can link your Wired Reflexes and your Reaction Enhancer. It cannot increase your survival tests in hostile environments by accessing ""How to survive"" guides. Etc etc etc.  .  You GM will have to rule on exactly what is covered and what isn't, but the basic rule is, INSIDE the body yes, OUTSIDE the body no.   .  Hope that helps!"
Shadowrun,3bp6g5,Wakshaani,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:54:42 2015 UTC,"First off I want to thank you for your response, its very rare that a freelancer sits down and explains their rationale for various bits. That said I understand everything you've said, and I'm just pontificating because I like grumbling about game design.   I'm worried that internal router will become problematic because you've literally given every GM the personal responsibility of deciding how every wireless bonus works, in many cases with complete absence of other information.  The way it reads now I see nothing stopping you from connecting this to any piece of gear you may have based on the line ""if expanded via a datajack or similar broadcast-enabled piece of cyberware, with the rest of the user’s gear"" and example that follows stating the router can be connected to a smartgun. This means that any piece of gear with a wireless bonus is up for judgement.  This isn't a problem in and of itself, but becomes one when you have a lot of wireless bonuses that don't give any clues as to how they work. Take for example the perception bonus that vision enhancements grant or the increase in social limit certain pieces of armor give. There is no background on why wireless helps those things so for the next 3+ weeks you're going to have people asking how they heck every wireless bonus works.  That's fine for me because I just run my own home table and we've got a big old book of houserules and don't give a damn what other tables do, but I feel bad for anybody who plays with more than one group that is going to have a different set of bonuses depending on who is GMing that day."
Shadowrun,3bp6g5,MrPierson,3,Wed Jul 1 23:39:15 2015 UTC,"I confess, it's going to be some work for each GM, and we'll probably have to go through and make a master list at some point, if only to keep the Missions people happy, since those rules have to be unified.  .  That said, I think I had a hiccup on the ""Broadcast-enabled"" bit. Poor phrasing. The idea was that you could have further interaction by using a wired datajack to plug other gear bits into the Router's system, allowing for more Things to chat with one another. Having your Smartgun connected to a Datajack, which is connected to your Internal Router, which is connected to a smuggling compartment in your thigh that has more clips of ammo, for instance, would allow you to keep ammo popping out and ready to exchange when needed, without someone hacking you wirelessly in the process. BUT, if you turned your Smartlink on to wirelessly request wind data, to get the +2 bonus dice for your shot, the Decker had a chance to get in there.  .  ""I have you now...""  .  Leads to a bit more dramatic option, tries to address the people upset that they can be hacked in the first place, but doesn't completely seal it up, either. It's a delicate balance, and I don't know if I hit this one just right or not. That I'm hearing both ""It's a total waste"" and ""It's broken!"" at the same time usually suggests that it's where it should be, but, that's not always the case.  .  Still, getting feedback is VITAL, and I encourage the talks about it to continue. Hopefully, we'll get everyone on the same page in time, the pros and cons will be laid out, and everybody will be, if not SATISFIED, at least amicable to the end result.  .

You can just choose not to, right? And there's plenty of viable (in my opinion at least) reasons why they might not have it that don't really matter in the end to the players.   If everyone has it, your player can't hack anyone. If no one has it, they can hack everyone (with wireless gear, obvs.) If sometimes it shows up in the oppositions loadout, it adds more variety.

The whole point of this thing is to take your gear offline, so, to me, the second you utilize something to give it any wireless connectivity, you open everything back up to attack. Because private or not, if you're broadcasting a signal from one device to another someone would be able to hijack it. So stuff like interfacing with a smartgun system or triggering a grenade shouldn't work unless you're willing to reintroduce that vulnerability.   I do agree that there's ambiguity about which bonuses come from a connection to the matrix and I could see that going to ways. (This assumes the above is correct and interfacing to any gear not directly connected to the router, i.e. inside your body, is wireless and is hackable.)

Shadowrun,3bmij4,masterblah,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:19:50 2015 UTC,Well i will admit the best parts of this book were the cybertech and biotech sections! Why can't i have guns firing NEAR MY EARS!!!!
Shadowrun,3bmij4,Wakshaani,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:36:35 2015 UTC,"Those are my bits, so thank you! :D  .  (And a brief look into my design process, here. CyberEars are kind of sad, lonely kids at the playground. They don't have many mods people care about, and now that the cost has gone up and earbuds do the same thing, why bother at all? The additional mods from 4th Ed were pretty anemic, so I set out to add some pizzaz to them for here, to make them more appealing. Antennae was pulled both from a personal love of Mecha Ears in Manga/Anime art (Honestly, if you're at a con with me, sketch a mecha gal and I'll squee like I was 15 again) and from the fact that I sell wireless routers in the day job, and a new Linksys router with three antennae just makes me stare. One, sure, two, I get it, but three is just overkill. BUT, three's a magic number, so three became the limit of how many would work together for that ear upgrade.  .  Tactical rails were a bit of 40K logic ... Shadowrunners, as a rule, don't wear helmets. Oh, plenty do at the tabletop, and all the cool Mirrorshades people do, but the cinematic ones? The ones you'd see in an animated feature or live action? Those helmets come off so you can see the face, everytime. Plenty of Shadowrunners in-universe are the same way, but, I'm a sucker for the ""Helmeted troopers looking around a dark place with lights on the side of their heads"", I needed more Cyber-Ear upgrades, and bam, there you go ... tactical rails on your ear, so you can clip a light to them, so you can do the cool ""look around the room with beams of light"" bit but not be wearing a helmet.  .  That somebody would naturally want to stick a gun on there was just a bonus. :D There's a bit of snark here or there, but there's some genuine advice as well. For instance, the note about Bioware being available in grades other than standard.   .  When y'all get time, I'd be interested in what you thought about some of the fluff. There's some neat corp stuff in there, some cultural stuff, a peek at a part of Africa that isn't Deepest Darkest Africa (we really have to fix that), some background stuff, some in jokes ... heck, I might give somebody a prize (I have no idea what, mind you) that figures out where a certain medical group's from.   .  You never know."
Shadowrun,3bmij4,masterblah,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:57:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really liked you made cyber ears better! the antennae and the rails are fucking sweet, chuck a sensor OR A FLAME THROWER and your good!   I also love the cosmetic cyber and bio from a lore standard."
Shadowrun,3bmij4,Haekel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:31:49 2015 UTC,"Teh EXTREME cyber-weapon was a fun way to get the giant vice, giant buzzsaws, etc, all in one place, and swapping both of your hands for them leads to Razor Fist syndrome, and nobody wants to be Razor Fist.  http://www.panelsonpages.com/?p=70431  My goal for new stuff was to have some stuff in there that's just world building, like LED Tattoos or joint replacement, some stuff in there that's obviously good, some stuff that has interesting angles, and some stuff that's odd enough that you go, ""You know what? I want to make Shark Guy. Just gills, swimfins one his hands and feet, fangs, sharkskin, the whole thing. Why? I don't KNOW, but ... I really want to MAKE The guy, even if I never play him.""  .  And, yes, the bit about the facial restructuring being mildly discomforting was me taking the piss. :D"
Shadowrun,3bmij4,Haekel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah so much awesome world building cyber and bio, great job on that! So many insane character ideas!"
Shadowrun,3bmij4,masterblah,2,Thu Jul 2 04:54:06 2015 UTC,"Nice!  Thanks, for this!  Popcorn time.  Edit: After 15 minutes of watching this, I have to say, that camera switching to the dude in the hood thing everytime he makes some noise is REALLY ANNOYING.  We don't NEED to watch you type, at all. Focus on the book.  The other guys isn't shown in the vid at all, why do YOU have to be?"
Shadowrun,3bmij4,Haekel,8,Tue Jun 30 13:06:55 2015 UTC,"I apologize senpai, please forgive me."
Shadowrun,3bmij4,masterblah,3,Tue Jun 30 13:36:53 2015 UTC,At least I have noticed you.
Shadowrun,3bo4yk,fastwalker0,2,Tue Jun 30 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can buy it directly from Battlecorps.com, there's usually a combo deal."
Shadowrun,3bo4yk,marwynn,2,Tue Jun 30 20:10:00 2015 UTC,"Many thanks!  I'll check out that website.  Its too bad eBooks don't automatically come with the physical book.  (I know, cry me a river.)"
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,Emparawr,6,Wed Jul 1 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"You can only have one spirit summoned that is not bound in 5e, and that is very important.  Because spirits resist summoning with only their Force, and can be summoned with a single action, it is crucial that you can't have more than one.  Players can already summon F10+ spirits fresh out of chargen.  They don't need multiple."
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,Shirck,-2,Wed Jul 1 00:15:43 2015 UTC,Actually the rules only say that you can only summon one at a time. They in fact dont say that you can only have one unbound spirit summoned at a time. Not sure why you seem the think that by raw this edition is like others but you are in fact mistaken. That is why people talk about it so much lol. If it actually said that you could only have one at a time then there would be no discussion at all. It would just be cut and dry. I will take that as input on what you think the houserule should be however.
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,Shirck,6,Wed Jul 1 01:44:00 2015 UTC,"You can only summon one spirit at a time, and it only hangs around for a limited time   The ""time"" that they are referencing is the ""limited time"" that the spirit hangs around for.  During that time you can only have one summoned spirit.  Its kind of like if the library said you can ""only check out one book at a time.""  They wouldn't mean you can check out one book and then go check out another without returning the first.  They'd want you to return the first book before you got your second."
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,reyjinn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:58:23 2015 UTC,I have never seen anyone disagree with the read that Shirck is offering that isn't just trying to game the game... the alot of arguments seems to have passed me by quietly.
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,marcus_gideon,2,Wed Jul 1 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly... it pretty much feels like anyone who tries to massage the wording ""one at a time"" to mean ""So I finish summoning one, and then I summon another"" is just trying to milk the system.  If it were that easy, why would anyone bother with Binding?"
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,Downtym,2,Wed Jul 1 02:11:58 2015 UTC,"You can have 1 Unbound spirit and up to Charisma rating bound spirits.  Unbound: ""You can only summon one spirit at a time, and it only hangs around for a limited time—a summoned spirit will return to wherever it was when you called it when it’s either through with all of the services it owes you or when the sun rises or sets (whichever comes first)."" - SR 5, page 300  Bound: ""A magician can bind up to his Charisma attribute in spirits."" - SR 5, page 301  As to historically: Iirc it was the same in 4th. In 3rd, 2nd, and 1st the differences between Shamans and Hermetic were non-trivial:  Shamans: * 1 spirit * Could summon on the fly * Spirit manifestation (type) depended on where it was summoned * Spirit lasted until the next sunrise or sunset or expiration of services  Hermetics: * Summoned and bound as actions which took hours per force (could not summon on the fly) * Could only summon elementals * Spirits lasted until expiration of services or a year and a day."
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,Downtym,2,Wed Jul 1 02:02:46 2015 UTC,Thank you for being the one and only person who read the thread and answered what the actual question i asked was. Interesting to see just how different the traditions used to be.
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,lshiva,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:44:53 2015 UTC,"Shadowrun 3rd Edition, pp. 184-189 has the breakdown of the old Shaman vs. Hermetic summoning mechanics.  I also highly suggest reading Magic in the Shadows pp. 14-27 and pp. 96-122 for more detail.  3rd Edition, IMHO, was the last Shadowrun high point and a very large number of my favorite supplements are 3rd edition - or late 2nd edition. I'm looking at you Renraku Arcology: Shutdown, Bug City, Super Tuesday!, Year of the Comet, and Wake of the Comet."
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,Beaumis,2,Wed Jul 1 22:09:34 2015 UTC,Interesting. I will have to check it out. Thanks for the info :)
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,marcus_gideon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:08:26 2015 UTC,This is explicitly covered in the Missions errata. One unbound spirit at a time.
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,marcus_gideon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:05:58 2015 UTC,Is missions eratta supposed to be entire game covering eratta or just for the missions series? It was my understanding that missions is like pathfinder society. They have their own faqs that dont apply to the game at large. They only apply if you are specifically playing society not just playing normal pathfinder we which is why they bother to separate it
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,marcus_gideon,0,Wed Jul 1 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"This is a bit ambiguous. Technically, there is no missions errata, only the missions FAQ. This one is continuously updated as new books are released. It is made up of mission specific rules, such as limitations on char gen for missions but also of FAQ bits where direct questions are answered. This is the only real FAQ there is and could therefore considered design intent.   On the other hand, the FAQ contains the following sentence on the front page:   These changes are Errata for Missions only, and are subject to change when the official Errata gets released.   If you're looking for a clear cut ""this is official with stamp, bells and whistles"" kind of answer, it is ""No"" simply because we are talking about Catalyst here. However, it is as official as any FAQ is likely to get."
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,marcus_gideon,0,Wed Jul 1 22:16:36 2015 UTC,I see. Yeah I have to say that the official errata is not as thorough as I would like.  It seems like every time I go to the errata looking for clarification I don't end up finding anything about it.   http://cdn.shadowruntabletop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/E-CAT27003E_SG-Errata.pdf?4713c7    http://cdn.shadowruntabletop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/E-CAT2700E_SR5-Errata.pdf?b979cc
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,RussellZee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:07:36 2015 UTC,"If you could control more than one at a time, it would basically make Binding pointless. While the team gears up, you'd just be mass producing elementals, no need for Reagents or anything, just conjuring your brains out. Then when it came crunch time, you'd unleash a swarm of magical hurt.  Which I suspect is what you were hoping for... a free army of elementals that would do your bidding, so long as you finish the job before sunrise / sunset."
Shadowrun,3bp1fy,Bamce,0,Wed Jul 1 02:14:43 2015 UTC,If your thinking that was my goal im pretty positive you didnt read my thread.
Shadowrun,3boofc,MedgamerTX,2,Tue Jun 30 22:16:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, neurostun, the deadliest of all gasses.  NS has the problem of it lasting 10 minutes or rather 100 dosings before going inert.  Or only a few doses if you get the faster version.  Therein lies the problem.  You need enough doses to knock out security, but not so many doses that it kills all the secretaries from overflow.  My suggestion is to use a heavier than air neutralizer.  So long as you're standing you get dosed, but as soon as you collapse, the neutralizing agent at your feet keeps you from continuing damage.  Still, offices usually have filters on their AC, so the gas attack may not be as effective as you suspect.  However, if you're calculating, a dose is used in a gas grenade and that has a radius of 10 meters I think.  That's about 300 square meters.  Assuming even spread with 1 gas grenade volume per turn, that's 10 meter radius the first turn, 14 meters the second turn, 17 on turn 3, 20 on turn 4.  As you can see, you get diminishing returns with a single gas port.  People will see others dropping before they get dosed.  You need to cover all your targets by the end on the second turn."
Shadowrun,3boofc,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:01:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry it took me so long to reply to this.  I read your post and took your points into advisement.    I went ahead and went with Neurostun-IX that has an active time of 60 seconds.  We did not deploy using a gas-grenade, we had a canister of neurostun in a metal tank and set up a piping directly into the air ventilation system.  We used 30 doses.    While we didn't get a neutralizing agent that is one of our side projects, the team mage had a different idea.  We used an Air Elemental to shepherd the gas through the area.  It's job was basically to pull gas away from unconscious bodies and down to the lower floors.  Essentially creating a 'smart' gas.    Thank you for your help."
Shadowrun,3boofc,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:56:31 2015 UTC,"Figuring out the neutralizing agent requires figuring out what neurostun actually is.  My suggestion is to ignore that and just call it a specialized antidote patch.  That takes care of the pricing and availability, the only issue is working out the mechanics."
Shadowrun,3boofc,Sebbychou,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:24:08 2015 UTC,"Remember you need enough dosing to fill both the air system and the rooms, for a long time, bypassing the filters and not triggering any of the sensors in the process (air filtration system does have those, they need to make sure the air they filter actually works, after all). That is easily tons worth of chemicals. Plus, you're gonna make a lot of critters and crawlers evacuate... Not particularly stealthy.  Thats why terrorists uses bacterial or viral (like Anthrax) weapons through air filtration, not chemical... And its no good for your plan.  And lastly...  Opened windows..."
Shadowrun,3boofc,sericatus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:52:32 2015 UTC,"The compound was less secure than we thought, and if there was a significant effect of the air filtration system it didn't show.  The GM spent a long time checking and cursing.  Our samurai more-so when we had literally no conscious bodies once we penetrated.  Honestly the air elemental shtick allowed us to be more conservative with our gas uses.  There were a couple of mages in house, best we can figure they were hit early on by the gas before they could raise a fuss about the elemental. (Though as pointed out by our local mages, this is the first encounter we ever ran without wards. Who skimps on wards?)"
Shadowrun,3boofc,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:00:19 2015 UTC,That almost sounds too easy...
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Bamce,15,Tue Jun 30 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"Prototype Transhuman is the coolest new quality. You are a vat grown human with 1 essence free bioware (but you still have to pay the nuyen for it), because you were genetically engineered that way. And you are forced to pick up some negative qualities to help reinforce your experimental nature. That's really cool.  Blank Slate and Dead Emotion are also cool. I like flavorful negative qualities like this. If I were to play a BTL junky, I'd totally pick these up.  Not sure how I feel about the new Cyberpsychosis. Seems like it might be a bit much.  Bag of Organs is a really messed up childhood start. That is uniquely Shadowrun. Nothing like hanging out with ghoul organ leggers to be their own private organ incubator."
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,dethstrobe,7,Tue Jun 30 05:25:10 2015 UTC,The number of mages and adepts that are about to start showing up with mild allergies to milk or cats or something is going to be hilarious.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,chummer5isalive,6,Tue Jun 30 12:28:42 2015 UTC,"What? Umm, I totally wasn't going to make a Mage with the new +Intuition bioware.   I was thinking Astral Bacon. I mean Beacon."
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,marwynn,3,Tue Jun 30 13:06:35 2015 UTC,Everyone in my game had mild allergies. >.>
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Elaphoil,5,Tue Jun 30 13:33:25 2015 UTC,"Cyberpsychosis   Did shadowrun use this before? I only remember it from cyberpunk, is it the same idea as cyberpunk?"
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,RiffyDivine2,4,Tue Jun 30 13:39:17 2015 UTC,"It was in SR4's Augmentation. And I recall it being in the fluff of older editions, but I'm not sure if it had mechanics for it. It has a prerequisite of needing antipathy, which gives you a -2 to all social tests, which is how it was in SR4. And than the actual cyberpsychosis when you glitch a social test you act violently, basically super uncouth, and then on a crit glitch you become an NPC for a time.  Its cool, but really brutal."
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,dethstrobe,2,Tue Jun 30 13:52:12 2015 UTC,Wow that is pretty tame from cyberpunks going on a murder rampage till someone puts you down.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,RiffyDivine2,3,Tue Jun 30 15:05:48 2015 UTC,"Shadowrun purposedly does not treat nor want to treat cyberpsychosis the same way as CP2020. Not cause we don't want to copy, but because we have fundamental different views about how cyber fits into the game"
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,BackgammonSR,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:54:48 2015 UTC,How so? When I saw cyberpsychosis I thought oh shit now it's in the shadows but it seems less scary then in CP. I thought when you hit zero in SR you just died and didn't go loco.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,RiffyDivine2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:02:48 2015 UTC,Correct. I'm not sure how that opposes anything I said though.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,BackgammonSR,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:33:15 2015 UTC,I'm not opposing anything I just wanted to know if there was more to it then that? I'm still switching over from CP to SR as of late.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,RiffyDivine2,2,Wed Jul 1 00:47:10 2015 UTC,Weren't there cyberpsychosis rules around the same area as cyberzombies in 3rd?
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Sebbychou,3,Tue Jun 30 17:43:56 2015 UTC,Tough and Targeted has a problem with scaling. Professional rating = Street Cred? What would a PR 13 be?
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Lionel_Laurie,2,Tue Jun 30 19:02:10 2015 UTC,Not so much. Just make sure to also be Notorious so you can burn your Street Cred occasionally.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,PinkTrench,2,Tue Jun 30 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"All too easy, just send a dragon at them.  ""Hey Kid, I hear you're tough. Bet you're not as strong as me.""  ""OH DREKKING BALLS!"""
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Valanthos,2,Wed Jul 1 01:03:32 2015 UTC,I was so excited by it at first then I realized it would never work on the hub.

Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Valanthos,3,Wed Jul 1 03:39:36 2015 UTC,Yep. Plus the obvious problem of what happens after street cred 6?
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Paddywagon123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:42:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it could be house ruled. Maybe after 6, Street Cred-5 = number of guys who show up to take you down.. So 7, 2 professional rating 6 guys show up to put you in place. 10, 5 PR6 guys show up..."
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Valanthos,2,Wed Jul 1 05:01:09 2015 UTC,At 10 that turns into a solo run. I can also only imagine how expensive that would be in drugs and ammo.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Paddywagon123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:24:40 2015 UTC,"Gives you reason to look for a way to drop your street cred... But remember if you lose, your street cred resets and the quality goes away (but it does have to be bought off)."
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Valanthos,2,Wed Jul 1 05:54:44 2015 UTC,It almost wants you to get notoriety so you could buy it off with street cred.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Paddywagon123,3,Wed Jul 1 05:57:42 2015 UTC,"Speaking of qualities, why do most of the positive ones in this book have horrible downsides?

Shadowrun,3bkv3d,WizardWolf,3,Tue Jun 30 19:11:31 2015 UTC,I'm more puzzled for the reasoning behind making what was formerly an optional rule for cyberlimbs into a quality was.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,chummer5isalive,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:50:25 2015 UTC,"Because I'm an evil bastard and adhere strictly to SR5's motto of ""everything has a cost"". There really is no other reason. Feel free to send me all your hate mail."

Shadowrun,3bkv3d,MrPierson,2,Tue Jun 30 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"In this case the cost is 8 karma. That's the point of positive qualities, they cost karma to use. What i don't understand is why they would have downsides that make them pointless and cost karma."
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,WizardWolf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:10:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you one hundred percent. I'm just making the point that comparing the different qualities there seems to be varying degrees of consistency on what the so called ""cost"" should be."

Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Shock223,9,Tue Jun 30 13:39:20 2015 UTC,I just bought the PDF. The stupid Table of Contents is completely useless. Again.

Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Furoan,2,Tue Jun 30 02:59:10 2015 UTC,Why the hell are they having ToC like this now? They used to be good at it! Its one of the reasons I got annoyed with WoD books because they had crap ToC...but the latest couple of books from them have had pretty good tables of contents and Shadowrun went to crap....Is there like a limited supply of 'good table of contents' writers or something?

Plus the Technomancer stuff was cut out for a separate book. It's like having the Magic book only have Magician related stuff and the Adepts get a separate book months down the line. And what TM stuff was there was kinda sad. They added a new echo instead of errata-ing the one in SR5 that turned TMs into Riggers because of some confusion about datajacks.

Apart from that getting your medicine skill up to where it would be as beneficial as this quality would take a considerable karma investment. As to stimpatches, they wear off pretty fast and add extra stun (can you stimpatch the stun from a stimpatch?).

It mostly is about how NPCs interact with PCs rather than vice versa, it is mostly a really lame defensive measure for wireless boosts. At the end of the day the hacking risk was always a tax rather than a threat. This just frontloads the tax by making each wireless bonus effectively another piece of ware which gets more efficient for every wireless bonus you have, rather than being something you will sometimes need to offline."

Internal router is an incredibly cheap piece of gear that's sole purpose is to completely prevent anyone from being hacked in a game where one of the design goals was let the hacker hack people.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,BitRunr,5,Tue Jun 30 04:09:33 2015 UTC,"Given that the wireless bonuses in the core book were all written by someone who has admitted he didn't understand what was required to make use of them, referring to design intent doesn't hold water."

That should give you a general feel for what you can, and can't, link up. It allows all of your cyberbits to talk to one another, but it doesn't help talk to things outside."
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,duncanmb,2,Tue Jun 30 04:50:47 2015 UTC,"I really like this, and it's even supported by the 'fiction'. The situations that come to mind are the rea enhancers + wired reflexes, which sensibly could work together over a PAN, and the autopicker, which describes hitting an online database of mechanical locks. The former is PAN-based, the latter Matrix.  Sadly, I don't think this would have been hard to do when they were writing Core. You just indicate, at every item, what needs a PAN versus an Matrix connection. It could even read:   Wireless (PAN): ... and Wireless (Matrix): ...   Doing it in retrospect, yeah, would mean just a big list, but I think at the time of writing all the original gear in Core, it could have been done with pretty low overhead."

Shadowrun,3bkv3d,duncanmb,2,Tue Jun 30 15:17:58 2015 UTC,"See, what bugs me about the internal router is that it's not an optional rule that supplants the frankly nonsensical wireless DNI requirement, you're patching over an issue by adding a cyberware tax item. What street sam ISN'T going to blow some capacity on this?   It's like the MMRI from Data Trails.

Clusterf*cked: Augments Post-CFD ..... 8 <- bolded for emphasis - this is a major chapter heading.  Manhattan Update ..... 14 <- new addition to the table, quickly tells you where to go for info on names involved in Stolen Souls (Manhattan)  Potential CFD-Infected Corporate Workers ..... 17 <- again, quick reference to a sub-topic.  Who was that guy at neonet who might be infected? stop thumbing through pages and pages of text and go here.    and so on.  the ToC doesn't need to be an exhaustive index, but each chapter has a lot of important sub-headings and putting these in the ToC can do a lot to help cut down on frustrating back-and-forth paging through the book."

My suggested fix was to knock it to ALPHA instead of Beta, and reduce the points gained from teh quality, since it'd be easier to handle. Probably 6, maybe 8.  .

Shadowrun,3bkv3d,MrPierson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:05:57 2015 UTC,"Dunno if this is a typo or not... why does Move-By-Wire grant (only) +1d6 init dice at Rating 3, just like it does at Rating 2? Is this the tradeoff for doubling as skill wires?"
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Boojum2k,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:40:01 2015 UTC,"The initial draft had no extra D6 increases at all, just the flat +2 Reaction and +3 Initiative (For a +5 total per Rating) ... Playtesting suggested it be powered up, so the +D6 came in. My initial thought was a completely reliable method of granting 5 per Rating was comperable to the variable level you got from Wired Reflexes. Some would rather gamble for the speed, some would take the more reliable road. Multiple pathways to the same goal.  .  Acting as Skillwires was a feature of the 4th edition version, so I carried that forward into the current edition, but set it as a simpler ""Acts as double the rating"", so 2, 4, 6 instead of the older level.   .  I trust the playtesters more than my own ability. I'm just one person, after all. Whatever changes they passed on, I'm confident that they went the right way."
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,RunnerPakhet,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:25:34 2015 UTC,I think I like the idea of making move-by-wires to be a reliable init over the random init of wired reflexes and it'd give it a powerful niché. Shame it didn't go that way.
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Malkleth,2,Wed Jul 1 23:52:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I wante dto make it similar, but a bit different. Boosted Reflexes, in contrast, I wanted to keep simple ... +1d6 Initiative, done. Cheap, not horrible Essence, but having the classic problems of ""Doesn't work with anything else"", ""Doesn't turn off,"" and ""Can't be removed"" ... those are great hooks both mechanically and in terms of storytelling, and I was willing to let them be a tad overpowered for the cost in tradeoff.

And why doesn't strike-through text work for me?"
Shadowrun,3bkv3d,Wakshaani,2,Tue Jun 30 12:29:05 2015 UTC,"So I've finally read through Chrome Flesh enough that I think I can give an informed opinion on it. Overall I think it's okay, not good, not bad, just okay.   The sections on cyberware, bioware, nanotech, and genetech all do what they are supposed to do and give players more options. Not all of them are really designed to appeal to shadowrunners, but that's not a bad thing as they add flavor. I will say I'm glad I play a houseruled matrix because the internal router cyberware is going to make waves at a lot of tables. There is literally no reason for a street samurai not to take this thing, and it seems to reinforce the idea that 5e seemingly was trying to get away from that the hacker should just pick up a gun with everyone else in combat. I will say I really miss the false front bioware, that was easily my favourite augmentation in 4e.   I'm not a huge fan of a whole chapter on CFD and feel it might better belong in a setting/plot book, but since its relevant to the metaplot I can see why it was included. The chapter on medical technology is a bit disappointing. We get 7 pages dedicated to advertising docwagon, a little bit on what its like to be a street doc, and then a bit on mental illness. I understand that with CFD going around the mental illness bit is imporatant, but personally I miss Augmentation's rules for severe wounds and determining what services a street doc has available compared to a delta clinic, but thats just me.   Next up there are the qualities which while all look really interesting, I have to wonder what effect Revels in Murder and Protoype Transhuman will have. Both seem close to must haves for Street Samurai's and Mages and Adepts repsectively. Heck bioadepts were already the way to go if you wanted to create the ""best"" samurai or face, and I only see this quality furthering that.   The last chapter is the one that I'm really going to go off on and say its terrible. It's 27 pages of wasted space. About half of it is devoted to the after effects of CFD and the other half is filler. The reason this really annoys me is that Augmentation had some really great stuff on what the cutting edge is/was: cyberzombies, biodrones, cyborgs. Look at cyberzombies/cybermancy. Chrome flesh does an absolutely terrible job of explaining what the frag a cyberzombie actually is. It doesn't tell you that a cyberzombie has negative essence or projects a background count or gains attribute bonuses based on how negative their essence is. What am I supposed to do with this as a gamemaster? Augmentation had rules for all of this stuff, so in effect we've gone backwards and literally lost information.   For the most part I loved the section on drugs though. That all seems really cool and useful and I can totally see it in one of my games.   On a final note the editing is about the level we've seen since Run Faster where little things are out of place or I guess haven't been communicated clearly between writers. Overall I give it a 6/10, but I'm a harsh critic."

Hoepfully, this will turn SKillwires from a ""Don't bother"" to a ""It works for the right concept"".

Third is excessively complex and suffers from hacking taking forever. Fourth has serious issues with dicepool inflation and a matrix that takes slightly less than forever and suffers from some conceptual problems. Fifth tries to squash dicepool inflation with limits but suffers from poor editing, miscommunications between writers,  and a matrix that tried to shove all of fourth's problems into a closet but the problems keep sneaking out.   In a perfect world I would use the setting from 3rd, some of the rules and setting from 4th, the gear and some rules from 5th, and an entirely redisgned set of rules for rigging.

Mind you, figuring that out took pouring over the books repeatedly, a lot of online discussions, hashing things out with other GMs and Players, etc.  The editing problems are serious, but there are a lot of fixes in 5th edition that are at least worth being aware of.  given the way you are asking this question, it sounds like 20th anniversary (4th edition) with plenty of house rules might suit you best.  For figuring out what those house rules should be, look at 5th edition.  if 5th comes out with a 30th anniversary edition in 4 years, after getting all the core books out, errata-ing the hell out of everything, and maybe even picking up a fan edit or two or carefully crawling through online discussions for rules ambiguities and simply broken parts, I would jump on that train fast enough to make you wonder where I'd picked up the Bleeding Edge Wired Refelexes."

That is the nature of game publishing.  If you want to support the publisher you have to buy their product. Without them there, nobody supports the product.  In the end, if you want something new, you've got to either follow the new edition or make it up yourself."
Shadowrun,3bnno7,CitizenJoseph,4,Tue Jun 30 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"However, if the publisher wants to keep anyone beyond the most diehard fans, he has to continually improve product quality with every rehashing or the consumer will decide it's not worth buying again."

Shadowrun,3bnno7,ScooterinAB,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:18:08 2015 UTC,"I have landed in the ""no"" camp after seeing the core book.  To me, my biggest issue is the glut of needlessly rules and over-complicatedness in general.  The writing style and editing just makes those things harder to get your head around really.  After running and playing SR as long as I have (since 1st), I need less rules, rather than more.  Especially since my players often look to me to be the master of the system and world as they jump in for the first time.  I need a system I can easily explain to a new player.  For me, this is not that in any way, this is more work and time spent explaining rather than playing.  Pass.  I shouldn't need to do all the suggested rules wrangling and demystifying people say will make it better.  That's not why I buy a game.    In addition to all the talk of editorial issues I see go past, the rules fights this edition has generated between players online seem endless sometimes.  The writing style and basic issues with editing exacerbate gamers tendencies to go to war over the crunch, and I see tons of ill will flying around this edition.  That too makes me sad.  So basically, I just don't need near this many rules to play the game.  If your table likes rules lawyering and games like Hackmaster, then this would probably be fun.  For me, its the only edition I have not immediately invested in and dragged people over to play.  The things I do like don't outweigh the things I don't.    All that said, it's not like I have had a chance to play it yet.  I also get too frustrated looking through it to do much in the way of chargen.  I just end up kinda frustrated seeing how ""my game"" looks in this edition.  Just me.  I am not hearing stories yet of the rules being bad at the table in game play yet.  Most conversation is about the bad presentation of them.  Maybe there's hope.  I am still struggling to find the motivation to find it though.  I'm also with the camp that says a game this good deserves to be well-presented, which is where this edition falls down the hardest.    Sorry Catadevs, please adjust your schedule to improve editing time, or else shell out a few extra beans for some extra help.  You are losing people and burning rep.  Simplify, and if you must complicate, then please illustrate.  3 pages of recoil rules are a sign you are in trouble, not nailing down all corners of the carpet.  Sorry, too ranty I'm sure.  Bitter over a very bad first impression.  Seen nothing on various forums to lead me to believe its improved much yet.  I'd love to see an upside.  Suggestions for podcasts of gameplay appreciated.  Convert me please.  I don't want to dislike any version of SR."
Shadowrun,3bnno7,floyd_underpants,0,Thu Jul 2 05:05:02 2015 UTC,"People online will find fault in all things.  Unless they have published a RPG themselves, take their bitching with a grain of salt."
Shadowrun,3bjwyq,myusernameisnttaken,12,Mon Jun 29 20:46:49 2015 UTC,"1) If you have absolutely no idea what you're doing, you should not be GM. Go find one, and play the game a while. Not only will this give you experience with RPGs in general, but with Shadowrun in particular. If you can't find a game in your area, check out /r/Runnerhub for online games.  2) Even if you think your only option is to GM the game yourself, don't use the Core book. Get the Quick Start stuff and go with that. These days, all the publishers are making Beginners Boxes that walk GM and Players through everything. Shadowrun is (almost needlessly) complex. It's not really something you jump into feet first... it will feel more like diving in face first.  3) PDFs are great... reading them on a phone is not. Get a laptop / tablet at least. That way you have a reasonable sized window to read. The core book alone is ~480 pages 9x11. You're going to hate yourself trying to productively read that on a phone.  4) This game uses huge handfuls of regular 6 sided dice (also called d6's by gamers). You can get them at the grocery store if you really want, though you will want about 20 (and that's still sharing between players). So you're best off finding the Friendly Local Game Store and buying from there. While you're there, ask about GMs and games.  5) It's super easy to find blank character sheets online. You literally just need to search for SR5 (short for ShadowRun 5) character sheet and you'll find them.  6) Wait, what? You want to go from ""less than noob"" to GM'ing by tonight? HA HA HA HA HA... no"
Shadowrun,3bjwyq,marcus_gideon,8,Mon Jun 29 23:02:17 2015 UTC,"are dice necessary?  I have is a .pdf of 5E on my phone which I can bring to the table, and that's it  what all materials are required for me to have a game up and running by tonight?   haha I really hope you're not serious about playing tonight, if this is the level you're at currently. I'll do my best to answer all your questions.   what actually makes it a game, like, are dice necessary?   It's a game in that you as the GM provide scenarios and characters and a World for your players to interact with, and you create the narrative around their actions. It's like a videogame that has absolutely no limits to its story, environment or potential. Its very addictive. Dice are absolutely necessary, as they provide the randomness needed to decide whether attempts at anything succeed. Pretty much everything you want to do, even in social encounters, has a chance of failure. The dice decide when that happens, be nice to them.   Is there a website/app I can use on my phone instead of dice?   yes, depends on your phone, but there are lots of diceroller apps out there, some specifically for Shadowrun even. Hell, even Windows 8 RT has one.   I see the pre-made character record sheets on the guide, so is there like a blank template I should print out to make our own, or will a sheet of paper suffice?   there is a blank at the back of the book you can print. Also fillable pdfs float around the internet that you can find. A sheet of paper works fine too, if you want to rough it. Keep in mind Character Generation is an involved process, with a lot of bookkeeping revolving around available points, and lots of flipping through gear listings to decide what gun/armor/car/spell/drone/power/cyberware/etc you want.   If I will need to print stuff out, is there anything else?   cheatsheets for rules.   Essentially what I'm asking is, what all materials are required for me to have a game up and running by tonight? - and anything else I should note as my first time being GM, not to mention playing Shadowrun at all?   you're gonna need a bunch of time reading through the sourcebook. Shadowrun has a whole lot of rules, you're not going to memorize them in a day, or even after playing a few games, it takes time to fully grasp the system.  As for general GM advice   Try not to say NO to your players when they come up with ideas. If they think of a solution to a problem that you didn't, try to work with it. If you don't know a rule offhand, make something up on the spot, write down somewhere what rule you didn't know, and keep on trucking. Look up the rule after the session and try to commit it to memory for next time. Most players despise being ""railroaded"" (forced down a particular story path with no deviation), so don't plan too far ahead. Have a general idea of the events happening, the major players and their motives/personalities, and some ideas on how to direct the players, but let them explore a bit Don't create custom NPCs for everything, most are just mooks and don't really need a statline past a general ""eh, average stats for this guy""   Shadowrun specific GM advice?   Hacking, Infiltration, Astral Projection, Negotiation, and all kinds of other scenarios can often have a single player taking up a bunch of time and leaving the others to twiddle their thumbs. When a situation like this comes up, try to cut away from the scenario at comfortable intervals to allow the other players to do something. Think of it like a movie, where the scene cuts away just before important moments to allow other things to happen, hopefully allowing multiple events to reach a climax at the same time. Even if technically they aren't occuring at the same time in-game, although having time lapses like that can be tricky, so try to avoid it if you can remember that the world is alive, and everything is likely being monitored at all times, and there are consequences for your actions. Plenty of RPGs allow you to be ""murderhobos"", wandering around killing as you please, living out of taverns and searching random caves for loot. That is not shadowrun.    I hope some of that helped."
Shadowrun,3bjwyq,TaeoG,2,Mon Jun 29 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"Also, some first time advice now that I'm thinking about it   might be best to get the group to start with just shooty or talky style characters, and save the drones, hacking and magic for when you're a little more comfortable with the setting and the rules there is a list of QuickStart rules you can find for each edition. All of them have a sample mission you can run called Food Fight. It's a great place to start. Especially with the cut-down rules for just the essentials like how to shoot someone in the face."
Shadowrun,3bjwyq,TaeoG,3,Mon Jun 29 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"Well the how to is a bit difficult to explain, but Whil Weaton does an ok job in the intro for his new show.   The world, the setting, the rules are different, but the essential way the game is played is the same. So my advice would be: Check out the first few minutes of that video (Before it goes into the details of the World of Titangrave), and then come back with all the other questions as they may arise.  If you still have trouble grasping how Pen and Paper is played, you can check out youtube and twitch, and I can also offer a (short) Intro-Session over teamspeak."
Shadowrun,3bjwyq,pnhh,3,Mon Jun 29 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"Lots of good answers already, but I'll weigh in.  Tabletop RPGs are a combination of a dice-rolling combat simulator and collaborative, ""improv theatre""-style storytelling.  Shadowrun is on the ""crunchier"" end of that spectrum, meaning that it relies pretty heavily on complex rules that try to precisely model dozens of factors and determines the outcome through dice rolling.  This makes it, unfortunately, fairly brutal for the first-time player.  It seems like each action requires its own complex set of rules to determine how to proceed, each character has hundreds of possible options to choose from, and many GMs consider a ""roguelike"" lethality to be de rigeur for the setting.  ...which brings us to the question at hand - how to be a GM.  As the GM, you are the referee, expected to speak with authority on all of the rules.  You are also expected to control everything in the world except the player characters - every shady operator, corporate thug, or psycho street ganger is your responsibility. You'll need to describe the scene so that the players can choose how to interact with it - and adapt the scene in response to the actions they take.    As the GM, you are the evil mastermind in the spy movie, leading the hapless heroes through your volcano lair - let them defeat some minions and find some secrets, then pull the rug out from under them and see if they can adapt. You're not in it to win - you have already won, you just want to see what they can do.  Playing Shadowrun without someone experienced in the system can be very frustrating.  Running the game for a table of new people is going to be nearly impossible.  The only way this is going to work is if everyone digs into the manual and learns how to play together, and that could easily take several full sessions.  That said, it's how most of us learned, and if you're passionate about it it can be a ton of fun.  Your best bet for running a game tonight is to get someone else to do the heavy lifting for you.  Pre-made characters are a good start, and the manual should include a few examples.  If you use these characters, you will be able to look up the different items and powers on the sheet to make sure you understand how they work, instead of waiting for your players to find things they're interested in and then scrambling to catch up.   You should also find a pre-made adventure.  The traditional start to a Shadowrun campaign is called ""Food Fight"", and should be easy to look up.  It's a simple premise, the cyberpunk version of meeting in a tavern brawl - you are all in a convenience store and get caught in the middle of an assassination attempt.  Since the hapless hitmen want to eliminate witnesses, the fight is on without any fuss.  As far as running the game, your job is to set the scene, then pass the spotlight around the table.     ""The shadowy alley smells like death.  Against your better judgement, you glance inside, and looming in the darkness you see a massive Troll.  He's methodically pounding something into the pavement with fists like wrecking balls.  Jack, you're the fastest, what does your character do?""   Your players will take turns telling you how they react (or arguing about what to do next). This is usually asking questions or trying to take an action.  If the action has a chance of failing in an interesting way, you should ask them to roll dice to see what outcome they get.    ""My character has low-light vision, can I tell what's happening?""  ""Okay, roll your Perception and add your Intuition.  Normally this would be at -4 for darkness, but your low-light vision eliminates that penalty.""    ""Okay, I got 2,5,3,3,6.""    ""Great, the 5 and 6 are hits, so you scored 2 hits on that roll.  The Troll looks like he got in a fight with a lawnmower, he's covered with deep slashes and losing a lot of blood.  It looks like he's just finished beating a Ghoul to death.""   Move around the table, making sure every player gets a chance to contribute to the scene.  Make sure there is something interesting going on and there is a chance for all of the characters to be important, but let them take the game in the direction they want to go.  You may need to throw out your notes and improvise, but that's part of the fun.  Good luck!  Let us know how it goes!"
Shadowrun,3bjwyq,mikekozar_work,3,Tue Jun 30 00:01:33 2015 UTC,To echo those who have mentioned the hub. That is probably your best bet.  If you are interested in /r/runnerhub let me know.

Shadowrun,3bjwyq,Bamce,2,Wed Jul 1 09:14:02 2015 UTC,"I've been playing as a player for probably a dozen or so sessions now and I think the best advice I can give you is to find someone already GM-ing a game. ShadowRun is an amazing game, but it can be really complicated. If you persist in wanting to GM, you'll want to find players who are really interested in investing themselves in learning the game.   I'd recommend that you avoid having players roll any sort of techy type characters; technomancers, deckers, and riggers. If you run a job that needs one for story purposes, run it as an NPC.  Magic using characters I've also found to be confusing at times with the way casting different types of spells works.  Honestly, there's a lot of fun to be had just going on missions, talking to people and shooting things up when necessary. I noted that you had a question regarding dice and character sheets, so you could maybe take a look online at something like roll20. The guy that GMs my sessions Chromecasts from his laptop to a TV so that we can all easily see what's going on."
Shadowrun,3bjwyq,stonemite,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:29:54 2015 UTC,"A few concrete game aids you might want to invest in - in addition to premade characters and a prepared adventure, you might want to set up a map to help the players visualize what's going on.  A whiteboard set flat on the table works well, since you can draw in the scenery, but you can improvise with cardboard and scrap paper.  The DriveThruRPG store linked on the right can sell you scenery or cardboard miniatures for a few bucks.  The cardboard minis are absolutely great - print them out and add a binder clip, and you have miniatures to track your heroes and villains, which will make the game much easier for a new group."
Shadowrun,3bjwyq,mikekozar_work,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:10:08 2015 UTC,"are dice necessary   Yes and no. Yes, they bring in the element of randomness, the ability for plans to fail. No, you don't need physical dice. There are dozens of apps and websites which can simulate it. I personally use random.org/intergers to generate a bunch of numbers between 1 and 6.    What makes this a game   Imagine a video game RPG. The players make their characters, there is a lot more flexibility here than in any computer RPG imaginable. The GM then makes the storyline and responds to what the players attempt changing the world around them. Because you aren't restricted to what's programmed in your storyline can go off the rails, they can get up and kill the Johnson because the job is too insidious for them and then hunt down the organisation he works for (this will most likely get them killed). But the point is the option is there.    I have no idea how to set it up.   Maybe look at running Food Fight for your first game. It's there with the free quick rules and should help you a little in getting your feet wet, then maybe you could try Splintered State. After doing both of those you might get a bit of a better idea how to structure your own jobs.   I have no idea what this entails beyond making characters and doing jobs   It doesn't really have to entail that much more if you don't want it to. But you could also invest in character arcs as things from the characters backgrounds come up. Alternatively your team of players could decide they have their own goal... setting up a bar or whatever and that could become the focus of a session.   I would be GMing, something I've never done before.   Read more, try to get in a game (/r/RunnerHub always has room for extra players) and get a feel for what it's like in the drivers seat. Also feel free to talk to your GMs about some of the design choices they made if you have a good session.   I have no idea where to start   Come up with a situation; FunTex is opening a new amusement park, District Council elections are up, Local Slumlord stopped paying the mob their share of the rent...   Then you design a run around that. FunTex is worried someone is going to sabotage their main ride, protect it at all costs. Alternatively you could set the team up to sabotage the main ride.  Design some basic characters, scenarios and security. Give it to your players, react to what they try to do and describe your world to them, adjust what you've already set up to cover any gaps in your world. Have fun!   I have a .pdf on my phone   Does a mate have a laptop? Ask them to bring it and if you can borrow it. It's a lot easier to use on a laptop than a phone.   I intend to buy the physical rule book if...   There's no need to have a physical copy omae. Sure it's nice to have around and read cuddled up in bed, but the pdf can serve you fine.   will a sheet of paper suffice   Yes, it also gives you more flexibility when making your character if you've got lots of gear or something which makes your section on something bigger than the books section.   If I need to print stuff out   Might be worth printing out a few cheat sheets of the tables in SR. Seeing all the dicepools and modifiers in front of you can be mighty helpful.   What's required for me to have a game up and running by tonight    Imagination Dice or a decent app/website 3-5 players Preferably a laptop to read on, but a phone should be fine. Courage"
Shadowrun,3bjwyq,Valanthos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:09:41 2015 UTC,"These guys are talking about things that require a basic understanding of what an RPG game entails. Let me take a step back:  A pen and paper rpg game goes like this:  The GM prepares a story for the next session, this can take from a few hours to a few days.  The players and GM set down 3-8 hours of their time to play a session. The GM has his story prepared and the players have their characters.  GM is responsible for playing out the story, impersonating characters in the world, keeping the players entertained. The players spend their time roleplaying the character they created, cooperating with each other to overcome the challenges the GM has created for their characters.  Over the next sessions the players almost always play the same characters, progress them, get more attached and involved in the overarching story. The GM usually connects all the mini-stories of each  session into a intriguing overarching campaign where  the players' actions have  consequences and affect the world around them.  The GM is a world-builder, storyteller and entertainer. The players are roleplayers, getting lost in the GM's world under the mask of their character.  The rulebook is meant to provide world building tools and inspiration for the GM, and make the experience feel more like a game with its rules, constraints and details (as opposed to a free-form improv acting play). The GM is meant to know the rulebook inside & out, or at least know where to look for relevant rules on the fly. That is one of the main reasons new players have a hard time GMing.  Edit: Of course this is a pretty subjective description, and everyone plays RPGs differently. It's like trying to describe ""what's the point of theatre plays""."
Shadowrun,3bjwyq,JoxFox,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:29:33 2015 UTC,"This is the closest I could find to my question, and it ends with someone saying that everything they need to know is google-able.

I guess that's to be expected from Harvard grads, now that they can't steal as much money on Wall street.    Leaving aside the absurd 'tactical rig' price, the 'tether' is a 16 foot piece of sub-spec rope for 30 bucks.  You can get 100 feet of mill spec black paracord for $5, and any self respecting SWAT member (or shadowrunner) would already have plenty such cord on hand."
Shadowrun,3bi5fu,hkdharmon,2,Mon Jun 29 14:20:54 2015 UTC,"$1400? I swear I could make that for less than $200. Cameras, wi-fi, the whole package."
Shadowrun,3bi5fu,sebwiers,6,Mon Jun 29 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"That price would need to cover labor costs too.  When I make stuff, I often find the labor cost I'd need to charge to be on par with my job (or even be worth my free time) puts the price out of reason.  Making it for my own use is reasonable (given I enjoy making it), but making it for sale is not.  But lets say you get the build time down to 8 hours, and it takes 2 hours or so average to support a sale.  That adds 10 hours to your build / sell cost.  You could probably do OK selling them for $800, maybe a bit less, assuming there aren't any big legal issues selling them.  Marketing to police, there might be - what if an officer is injured while using one because he thought the room he was about to enter was clear?  Regardless of who is at fault, the legal costs could be absurd.    I suspect (profiteering aside) that's why a lot of small volume production 'tactical' gear ends up costing a lot; they may either need to get a bunch of (paid) experts and cop-union buddies to sign off as supporting the products use that they are efectively sue-proofed, or they need a big enough war chest to fight off vultures."

Knowing when to pull your buddy out of the fire and knowing when to stand and fight or run.  Leon the Professional Corrupt cops, a professional hitman that could even be a runner teaming up with a newbie runner/hitman out of compassion.

I once tried to implement it by describing the places the runners lived in day to day for five minutes each before and after runs. The dumb muscle every day walked by his shithole neighbours over hearing them yelling at eachother, or seeing their eight year old daugher smoking in the stairwell. Then BAM have some syndicate types shoot up the place after he got back from a run.   He loaded up and stayed at his door looking through his peephole, expecting it to be some sort of GM trap. Then I tried the scene where Matilda goes to Leons door just like in the movie to see just how far I could have it go...

After each assignment, the actives are subjected to another personality wipe so they can enter the next scenario with no memory of an earlier one. At least, that's the plan -- but as the series unfolds, Echo's memory begins to return, and she slowly starts piecing together her true identity.  Furthermore, an FBI agent is trying to investigate the Dollhouse.  Shadowrunners could be hired to divert the FBI agent's attention (maybe change FBI to Lone Star?).

In 4e, BPgen was preferred for specialised characters, as the cost of 5 rank 1 skills was the same as 1 rank 5 skill.   Karmagen's increasing cost per rank produces more generally capable builds."

In my experience I can usually get about what I want out of it, but it takes a bit more time and effort.   The main difficulty is finding the right balance for game building that way. I'm never quite sure how many points the players should have and how many my villains should have to be a challenge for them.   With the BPGen, I just know about how strong any given PC is so I can make an appropriate challenge for them. Karma build, I just don't have that scale memorized to the same degree.  It's kinda like working in SI units when you grew up with Imperial units; it's doable but never feels quite right."

This is for 2 major reasons.  1) It helps me get a feel for the NPC and make it a fully-realized character rather than just a stat block. 2) By setting the points I spend on the NPC a certain multiple of the player's, I can have a reasonable idea of how much of a challenge the character will be.

Chummer or Herolab won't support it, but you could kick the character into ignoring the rules and just keep track manually.  Honestly though, I don't really understand your argument. A 400BP character and an 800 Karma character will generally wind up looking the same. The Karma character will typically have more lower-ranked skills to increase the stats of core competencies, but overall they'd be similar enough that you could squint and go 'yeah, they're close enough.' Expecting a 1:1 balance out of Shadowrun is a fallacy though; a fight between two street sams is going to be more about who gets the drop on who rather than who's got the extra dice in shooting.  If karmagen doesn't give you what you want, you might get some use out of Sum-to-Ten, in which you can have multiple choices at the same Priority rating, provided they add up to a total of 10 or less. A costs 4, B is 3, C is 2, D is 1 and E is 0."

I may be able to build characters in 5E using it, but I don't think most of my players could handle the game without Chummer.

You are a number... unless you are SINless, in this case you are garbage. But this is good for a runner, LESS taxes and no paper/data trail for police and corps to follow. The specific licenses you get should be discussed with the GM, this is very important (for example, I'm specially thinking about your interpol association. I wouldn't allow you to have a current affiliation to interpol as a SINless person, and they are not that stupid/hackable). Licenses are for simple things: driving, weapon possession (as you have), magic usage, technomancy usage (with care). And I also like you private investigator license. ;)  As to the char gen in specific, you can interpret that value as the name on the fake SIN, I believe it has no mechanical value but it's great for flavour. As for the fake license, they are good to narrow down the license nature to what I explained in the 1st paragraph.  I suggest you get a rating 4 SIN as police scanners only have rating 3 and it serves as threshold... Therefore, typical police scanners never catch you. I think you'll want the fake licenses associated to the rating 4 SIN and use the lower rating to do non-gameplay things like shopping and such.  In the end just remember, the rating just tells you how good the SIN is. Rating 4 is standard shadowrunner survival, rating 1 is shopping good, rating 6 will probably be good against a thourough private investigation.  I think that's pretty much it..."

I mean, real play, at a table, why would you sweat your characters 115 nuyen? No character can't afford that, and keeping track of them on the sheet seem like arbitrary tedium for the sake of arbitrary tedium. It also violates assuming your runners are competent. And it seems like any lifestyle above Low would just cover all of this anyway. The same thing applies to some of this other stuff.  Also, why wouldn't a 3000-nuyen commlink come with trodes? An iPhone comes with a headphone/mic combo today.  Also, the Survival Kit explicitly includes a knife.  EDIT: In total you listed 31 items. Of those 31 items, one is included in another. Of the remaining 35, 17 of them have no restrictions and avail <4 and total, in value, 1226 nuyen. If we remove the miniwelder and survival gear, this drops the value down to 776 nuyen.  Here's a rundown of those items:  ITEM                    AVAIL PRICE Meta Link                 2    100 Standard Tags (10)        0      1 Datachip (10)             0      5 Silver Credstick          0     20 Regular Credstick (5)     0     25 Trodes                    0     70 Micro-Transceiver         2    100 Micro-Camera              0    100       Metal Restraints          0     20 Plastic Restraints (10)   0      5 Crowbar                   0     20 Miniwelder                2    250 Survival Kit              4    200 Gas Mask                  0    200 Standard Rope             0     50 Long Haul                 0     50 Knife                     0     10   13 of those items are literally no avail, meaning you can just go buy them, whenever, wherever, for the price listed. In terms of 'separation as bulleted list', you have 19 bullets and these items make up >10 of those bullets.  I think you should make this a sub-list called ""Cheap, everyday items that runners should consider picking up on the way to the run"" because you can literally spend an afternoon getting that entire group of items together after chargen. Or after your first run, for that matter, because they're collectively dirt cheap. Just head over to your local CES (like Best Buy) and army surplus store and you're set.  My question, then, is why is it so important to put these on my sheet? Why do they take up so much of this list as 'go-to gear'? Demanding someone has a crestick on their sheet, or a data chip, or a standard tag, violates assuming that your PCs are competent individuals. Do I need to explicitly state that I spent 20 nuyen in order to bribe this guard? 0.50 nuyen to back up this data? That I spent the 3 nuyen necessary to have the six zip-tie handcuff sets I need?  I'm honestly asking. Sell me on why this is important! How does this not come off as screwing players over just for the sake of screwing players over?"

I have a knife in your house, and I certainly own a crowbar.  EDIT: Since Boojum2k observed that a player might try to exploit these rules by claiming dozens of items in those price ranges, here are some alternative rules that might work out if you have a more adversarial gameplay setting (quoted from below).    At the beginning of every job, roll Edge and count the hits. On the job, you can have 1+Hits items of avail and cost equal to or less than the following table:    Lifestyle Avail Nuyen    Street -- 0   Squatter 2 25   Low 4 50   Medium 6 100   High 8 250   Luxury 12 1000    When buying items that come in bulk (like RFID tags and bullets), you may be one unit's worth per hit you spent (10 bullets, 10 datachips, 100m of rope). Your character must also reasonably have this sort of item, e.g., a decker cannot produce reagents for a mage to use.   These prices should probably be tested in play a little, but I feel like they're in the ballpark of 'right'. The rate of usage might be too high, but I erred on the side of not completely screwing over people who dumped Edge. You could also modify it so that, while they can have brought it from home, they have to replace it if it gets ruined during the job (cutting into their profits).  To be honest, though, I did it slightly differently when I last ran 5E frequently. At the beginning of every session, I gave the players, collectively, a set of markers equal to that number of players. They could retcon into having an item, or enough for all of them (like 4 gas masks, one for each), any item that lacked restriction with avail <=8. The catch, however, was that they had to have enough money between them pre-run to have actually bought the gear off-screen. They spent the nuyen, scribbled the gear down, handed me back one of the markers, and play continued. It even led to cool moments sometimes, like, ""Fuck what now"" ""It's cool, I brought a welding torch!""

Shadowrun,3be6zl,kaosjester,2,Mon Jun 29 22:30:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, look, you asked me for some arbitrary cutoff, so I made one up. I guess I wasn't explicit about the 'common sense' / 'within reason' clause, though, that should obviously be attached. I mean, yeah, if the way the game you're playing works is that the players are expected to exploit every last loophole so that they can get an edge of the adversarial GM, then I guess it's a bad rule. But there's a pretty big disconnect between ""I have 200 meters of rope in my pocket because the RULE SAID I COULD QQ"" and ""why wouldn't I have trodes on this job.""  It's a pretty simple question: ""would your character, of more than reasonable competency at their job, think to bring X?"" Not you, your character, the 10-foot tall murdertroll with robo-arms. He probably thought about getting some rope in the 72 hours he had to plan this job, even though you, the player, only had 30 minutes.  If you can't handle that sort of abstract, realistic roleplaying, though, where players can't be honest with themselves and need to exploit things the exact way you're proposing, here's a patch:   At the beginning of every job, roll Edge and count the hits. On the job, you can have 1+Hits items of avail and cost equal to or less than the following table:    Lifestyle Avail Nuyen    Street -- 0   Squatter 2 25   Low 4 50   Medium 6 100   High 8 250   Luxury 12 1000    When buying items that come in bulk (like RFID tags and bullets), you may be one unit's worth per hit you spent (10 bullets, 10 datachips, 100m of rope).

(player scribbles it on the sheet, deducing the money, and passes me the chip, while everyone else smirks)  Incidentally, this approach cut job pre-planning time literally in half because they weren't worried about covering every last angle. The result was that we freed up another hour or so of every session to get in more story, plot, and fun.  The important part here, though, was that our player contract was not ""the players should exploit every rule they can for an edge over the GM that's trying to kill them"". It was ""we're here to collectively tell a good story, and the dice might kill someone, but hey cybercrime""."

Also, these aren't ""criminals"" like today, they're criminals in a cyber-future where they get high-end corporate contracts.

Standard tags/datachips/credsticks are just a small tax to say you have them. If you have a medium lifestyle I usually handwave the need for credsticks. Stealth tags on the other hand are neccesary.  Trodes are definitely important to have and not just handwave. Yes they are cheap but you need em on your sheet for your first run.  Handcuffs and Zipties are so useful that you damn well want a few for utility, but you can drop em if penny pinching.  Crowbar/Miniwelder are really fragging useful, my PCs rarely leave home without one just in case.  Gas masks are needed to hide your face from security camera and for some toxins, it's a definitely have and not need situaion.  The survival kit does come with a knife now that you mention it, I remember someone telling me I hadn't put a knife in originally so I was right the first time. Doesn't hurt to have 2.  You wouldn't believe how many people don't know about the micro-tranceiver.  Ultimately, sure you can go without these items without much issue, BUT when you have the cash to splash get em.

Figuring out if you remembered to pack a crowbar to see if your intended path of approach will work out doesn't sound like a lot of fun, it sounds like a GM intentionally screwed up a player plan because someone didn't have twenty nuyen and a few seconds to scribble down ""crowbar""."

If your players lay out an awesome approach, get to the job, and realize it isn't going to work without a crowbar, are you going to, as a GM, derail your player's plans because they didn't have a crowbar?

Likewise, their PC is a professional criminal who does this for a living, so how likely is it that they'll forgot to bring a crowbar even if the player forgot?  Your argument seems to be, ""Just in case, scribble all these things down!""  My counter-argument is ""why won't we treat the PCs like the competent criminals they are? Or course one bought a crowbar before this shit went down.""  Nice to see you aren't recommending pistols, though."

This is a guide, that helps players, especialy new players, figure out what to get at character gen and what is actually good to have on them/have at their house. This is not a: You must have X, Y, Z or your character is useless.  In fact, it helps players start to have the kit that their character would have in the first place as a professional criminal. For example, Bankrobbers have zipties for hostages, etc. By telling players of the stuff that they should probably have on their character, you begin teaching them to think like a shadowrunner.  I am not saying you need to have all of this on you at all times, or that you can't pop up to the shops before going on a heist. This is just a beginner bag of stuff that is useful so that you DON'T need to go to the shops when time is of the essence (Like needing to track a car in a 5 minute window as the driver pops into a store).  So in summary: Guide is to help teach players to think like competent criminals with the tools.  GMs decide on whether or not they want to be strict on when and where they can buy stuff."

That's good!  I still think maybe you should restructure it a little, though. Like I'd do it as Part A: Something for Everyone, where you list guns and SINs and Armor, Part B: The Electronic World, where you list comms and stuff, and then Part C: Everyday Items for the Everyday Criminal, where you list out the other gear. You could even make a big show out of it, man, out of how this shit is all dirt cheap and super-useful to a criminal, so everyone should consider picking it up as they can.

Shadowrun,3be6zl,randomaccount178,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"As a GM, I agree that not every item should be accounted in your gear list.  Especially if you can just walk down to the nearest WareGreens (TM).  That being said, I normally let a month lapse between adventures.  This allows players to upgrade their toons without worry until the next game session.  It helps remove cluttered RPG moments, like:   How long it takes to buy a new gear How long it takes to train a skill/spell/attribute/etc. Paying monthly lifestyle costs (which I enforce... Thank you, Chummer!)   The only time I ask for players to roll or role-play is if it would add to the story or the story requires it.  I also require it if the availability rating is particularly high (+18).  Forbidden items are decided by the GM (me).  Some GMs let themselves get caught up with itty-bitty details and/or power trips.  They forget the most important aspects of RPGing are story and content.  Screw those tight-wads!"
Shadowrun,3be6zl,rejakor,-1,Mon Jun 29 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"NotB0b wrote this for an online community where due to fears of 'unfair advantage' a set of rules are enforced that do include your character not having a lighter in their pocket unless it's written down on a pdf hosted to Drive.  I personally find that jarring and annoying, but apparently the majority of players in those communities feel it is necessary to stop boring cheaters from cheating boringly."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,kaosjester,2,Mon Jun 29 08:54:09 2015 UTC,"I suspected as much, and I agree with your sentiment. That's why I brought it up: I think that a GM looking for a resource to hand new players, new to the game itself, should see the 'grain of salt' perspective next to that list."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,randomaccount178,-1,Mon Jun 29 09:14:04 2015 UTC,"The counter argument I would make, who exactly has a lighter in their pocket? The answer, smokers and almost no one else. That is the problem. Most men at least walk around with keys, phone, wallet, and maybe one or two other items. Just hand waving an item away because its common doesn't make sense. Just because an item is common doesn't mean a person carries it around with them everywhere."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,Paddywagon123,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"I am not a smoker, I have a lighter in my pocket.  Also a pen knife.  I'm not even going somewhere I have a use for these things.  A criminal having a crowbar in the boot of his car is not a huge stretch of anyone's imagination.  Or a knife in his boot.  If someone is playing a laissez-faire happy-go-lucky person who has his autopicker and ten feet of monowire and a stungun and a medkit with him when out to see a play, that's a roleplaying issue.  It's solved not by 'making 200 item gear lists', it's solved by asking Jim 'would your character REALLY have that on him' and jim thinks about it and goes 'well actually I guess not' and thinks about it a bit more in future.    The only time it's not just an oversight on the part of the Jims of the world is when the Jim is from a GM vs Players table and not grabbing at any advantage the GM gives you, metagaming or not, is tantamount to suicide.  And getting a GM vs Players player to stop GM vs Playersing is a whole different thing."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,kaosjester,-1,Mon Jun 29 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"See the part about one or two items that I mentioned? Those two items would be the two in it. I am not saying people don't carry around things, or that only a smoker carries a lighter, but most people who don't smoke don't carry a lighter. When your character who has no history of smoking, and no reason to have a lighter, and never showed any indication they had a lighter, suddenly pulls a lighter out of their pocket for a situation they desperately need one, then it somewhat kills disbelief. If you want to make a character who likes to carry around a pocket knife and a lighter then more power to you, but to magically summon common items out of nowhere because they are common doesn't really pass the smell test for me."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,esonlinji,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"Pfft! Get with the times.  Cigarettes are wireless thus don't need a lighter anymore.  That was of course biting sarcasm.  On a more serious note, a lot of things can fall into either lifestyle or toolkit.   Do you have a survival kit? Then sure, have a lighter.  Do you nerd a car?  Not if you've got a decent lifestyle that covers taxis, or limos or even rental cars.  I mean, you don't want to bring it on a run with upu, bit you don't really want to risk your own car either."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,Paddywagon123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"The situation you are describing has occurred to me both as someone with the lighter, and someone without the lighter.  Not that it even matters - you're missing the thrust of the argument.  I'll try to summarize.  Players should not explicitly have to state that their character is taking an item with them that that character would know they need to take.  If you're going camping, your character with 5 rating in the Survival skill takes a knife.  If you're breaking into a warehouse, your character with 16 years as a career criminal brings a crowbar.  When you're going to get paydata, your decker whose life is tech takes a few datachips.  In my experience, also, criminals and ex-military and ex-police all tend to both carry more items on their person at all times they are in public, and have more useful things in their car 'just in case'.  Saying 'average person' to describe a 6' tall cybered death-monster with 10 years of underworld black ops to his name is kind of a misrepresentation, also."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,syrinaut,0,Mon Jun 29 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"Some level of abstraction is perfectly fine. If you are going into the outdoors then saying I buy camping supplies would be perfectly fine, but if you are in a plane crash and pull camping supplies out your ass because you have 5 in survival, that isn't going to pass mustard.  Either way, it is your job to envision how your character works. If you choose to buy a whole slew of super advanced lock picking tools and don't pick up a crowbar, then guess what? It isn't because you don't have knowledge that your character would, but because you didn't envision your character crowbaring open and brute forcing stuff. That is on you."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,Paddywagon123,0,Mon Jun 29 18:23:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's on you.  You are the person insisting that the player with an hour of prep time come up with all the things the character assembled for the job over a week.  Without the assumption that if the player didn't think of it, the character didn't, you can do things like say 'my character thought to bring a crowbar'.  Your argument is that the player should have all the relevant knowledge available to the character, and make choices based on that.  I call bullshit on that, as I cannot think of any character in any game I have ever run or played that involved only knowledge possessed by the player.  Additionally, you're phrasing it as 'choosing', as if the player 'chose' to omit explicitly bringing a crowbar.  That is incorrect.  If the player intentionally chose not to bring a crowbar, then saying their character brought it is lying.  You are accusing players of intentionally cheating and lying instead of acknowledging the existence of simple oversight.  Occam's razor cuts that one down at the knees.  Thirdly, and finally, you're repeatedly using hyperbole to twist the meaning of the examples.  Yes, the character in a plane crash 'pulls camping equipment out of his ass' instead of 'being the kind of person who carries a leatherman in their non-carry-on luggage, which they managed to retrieve from the plane before it sank with Swim checks'.  They instead retrieve a camper van from inside their bottom, full tents and so on.  That's exactly what i'm talking about, and in no way a straw man argument."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,syrinaut,0,Mon Jun 29 18:36:18 2015 UTC,"That isn't hyperbole, and your character isn't perfect. You don't have perfect knowledge or perfect skill. You can fail to bring an item you may need, and you can experience things you weren't expecting or have dealt with before.  Your character is not omnipotent, he doesn't operate with perfect knowledge of what he needs, and his experience doesn't encompass the breadth of his field. That is why the ""Well, my character would know to do this"" angle is so incredibly flawed. It isn't any ones job to figure out what the breadth of your characters knowledge and mental state is, it is yours to analyze how your character would go about things and prepare accordingly. If you did not do the proper preparation, then that is on you.  EDIT: And for the record, I NEVER used choose in the context you are implying, so maybe stick to what I actually said."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,BitRunr,0,Mon Jun 29 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"If you choose to buy a whole slew of super advanced lock picking tools and don't pick up a crowbar, then guess what?  It isn't because you don't have knowledge that your character would, but because you didn't envision your character crowbaring open and brute forcing stuff. That is on you.   that's the context, emphasis mine.  That sentence has no possible other meaning in the english language.  Again, you're using hyperbole, and acting like that validates your viewpoint.  You are acting as if, if you let a player 'have brought a knife' suddenly the character is 'perfect' and 'omnipotent'.   your character isn't perfect... perfect knowledge or perfect skill.. you can fail to bring an item perfect knowledge of what he needs   Completely ignoring that what is being talked about is the gap between PC competency and player competency, not some kind of absolute rule.  There aren't two choices, one of which is 'written down on your sheet beforehand' and the other is 'have every item at all times, up to and including intercontinental ballistic missiles, even while you're shackled hand and foot naked in a cell'.  Taking things to their absolute extremes and pretending that is the actual use-case is a) extremely illogical b) the logical fallacy known as 'hyperbole'.  And again, only in the scenario where you insist on forcing everyone to have everything written down and pre-planned no matter what, is it 'someone's job' to 'analyze and prepare accordingly'.    That is not inherent to roleplaying games.  It's not even the most common case, despite some people like yourself trying really really hard to make it so.  And throwing literal angry fits when it isn't the case, and accusing the GM of cheating for allowing it, things I have witnessed, personally, dozens of times.  Do you have any defence for shitting up games by refusing to acknowledge a factual difference between player knowledge and competence and PC knowledge and competence?  Or just 'it's on you' and hyperbole about 'perfect omniscience'?"

Why punish a player for forgetting to say or write an axiomatic inclusion in their character's arsenal?  If your players find trivial preparation that real life humans do without thinking (like putting your keys and wallet in your pockets) to be part of the fun, then that's different, but I'd be pretty upset of my GM tried to tell me my gun has no bullets in it because I forgot to say I load it.

I have had too many players come to my table with GM vs Players attitudes inculcated into them by people taking this stance, and killing any actual roleplaying or fun occurring by rules-lawyering or constantly maneouvering for advantage or lawyering their actions or trying to lawyer /other/ people's actions, to the point where the group actually had to ask them to leave, to be okay with this.

Shadowrun,3be6zl,fastwalker0,2,Sun Jun 28 22:40:35 2015 UTC,"'screws over'  There's two arguments being made for 'super anal item accounting' in games.   Buying stuff and only ever using that specific stuff creates immersion because ??? (they're pretending that player:pc time and knowledge is 1:1?) Allowing PCs to have stuff it makes sense for them to have is 'unfair' because what about the people who put all that boring time into designing long equipment lists!  Shouldn't they get some reward for their effort?   The first is subjective, and I can't really answer it without understanding the basis for the 'fun' and how it is 'ruined' by other people not doing it in the exact same way you are.  The second, though, is fundamentally disputable.  The only reason to reward someone for doing something boring in a game if it is necessary for the game to function.  Given the people arguing and voting against people saying a game 'cannot' function if characters are allowed to 'have brought along zip ties', presumably you are either saying that they are wrong and their games aren't functioning, or, that argument is advocating for a GM vs Players stance, where players 'winning' (gaining money and power) and 'losing' (dying, losing money, losing power) are based purely on player skill, and is the point of the game.  It has been said a thousand times and I will say it again.  GM vs Players is an ego-stroking endeavour that destroys and devours any concept of fun.  It is never an excuse to do anything, no matter in what guise."
Shadowrun,3be6zl,fastwalker0,-1,Mon Jun 29 09:03:00 2015 UTC,Or there's the people who actually enjoy making long equipment lists of everything their character has and poring over the gear list drooling.

Don't be a dick to other players or the GM, i.e. be civil by the standards of the group. Don't metagame, i.e. use out of game knowledge in a way that detracts from the group's experience.   That's basically it for 'musts'.  I'm sure I could think of a few more that are 'a good idea', but when it comes right down to it, 'optimize your character' and 'always write out detailed gear lists' and 'bring snacks to the game' and whatever else are not things I would enforce on other people who are roleplaying with me."

Shadowrun,3becx1,Bamce,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:14:40 2015 UTC,Should just host it on google drive or drop box. I know I'm not downloading some random file on the internets :P But that might just be my shadowrunner survival instinct speaking up.
Shadowrun,3becx1,Bamce,2,Sun Jun 28 18:12:03 2015 UTC,"Those are some instincts, but I do see your point. Changed the link to Google Drive so people can preview."
Shadowrun,3becx1,Bamce,2,Sun Jun 28 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"Also helps if people wanted to check it on mobile.  However to the actual sheet. It has less of, but still the same problems as the ones from the book.  So many spots for things most chars won't need. Check out chummer or herolab For other examples."
Shadowrun,3becx1,Bamce,2,Sun Jun 28 21:54:23 2015 UTC,Good point about the mobile.  I actually designed the sheet especially because the chummer's sheet is a mess of unsorted data with way too much redundant information in my eyes. YMMV of course.  Mind point out what specifically you consider unneeded spots/information?
Shadowrun,3beo7l,Ravenhops,5,Sun Jun 28 15:08:14 2015 UTC,"I've no idea how it works in the hub or net, but my GM lets me use pretty broad strokes like 'metal' 'stone' and 'plastic'. When I come up against something I want to work with, he figures out where it sits on the object resistance table, and I go to work. He's beginning to regret that.  Some I'm sure believe that you need a different shape spell for every distinguishable material, for example shape oak/elm/mahogany, but I think that's pretty overkill. To be honest I'm quite curious myself how the hub views this particular spell and its possibilities.  Edit: I'd hope there's a sort of middle ground but don't have much stake in attempting to come up with one at the moment.  Edit 2 with examples!: So my first run, I shaped a hole in the outer wall of a morgue (which our pixie was scouting while I also had an extended spatial sense spell going which focused concentration negated the penalty for) which was made of some kind of concrete, and had metal framing and insulation which I didn't bother to mess with magically. Ended up being something like 9 opposing dice against my 18. Then I sealed it back up and dropped the spell.  Later inside the morgue we encountered a locked metal storage compartment where I used shape metal to separate the locking mechanism so the drawer could slide open freely, and after we'd gotten what we came for I resealed the lock and fused the back of the bin to the metal frame it rested in so it would stick shut then dropped the spell, this one was about 6 opposing dice against my 18.  Sometime later on the same run we were attempting to extract someone from within a ganger-infested abandoned compound out in the middle of nowhere. I ended up flattening a transformer to cut power to the base (upwards of 15 dice against my 18 this time) then made an inclined tunnel directly from the roof to the cell the prisoner was being held in (concrete opposing me with about 9 dice again). Then on the way out I sealed shut the only gate on the outer wall of the compound with a combined shape metal/stone dual-cast which was about 15 dice opposition on each.  As we extracted I had time and not much else to do and this gang had royally pissed off a member of the team by attacking her fixer, so with her prompting I spent the next 5 minutes or so collapsing the compound into rubble from our distant vantage point, which the GM treated as an extended test.  So I threw a lot of mojo around on that run, and circumvented the GM's expectations a few times. I also never took any drain as those spells are all fetished for that character. The rest of the team had plenty of time in the spotlight and everyone had a good time, but yeah, everyone was pretty impressed with how much utility I had with just the shape spell."
Shadowrun,3beo7l,D_Keller,5,Sun Jun 28 16:22:55 2015 UTC,"We haven't had anyone try to take it really.   The spell requires so much specific gm-player interworkings on just about everything, as outlined here.  That when dealing with the multitude of gm's the hub has its not practical. It would be unfortunate to devote so much of your character as outlined here and and have to struggle every game with different gms on what does and does not work"
Shadowrun,3beo7l,Bamce,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:32:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured it'd be a pretty contentious spell. I wouldn't be surprised if it was banned altogether. If there were interest, do you think some sort of homebrew limitations could be outlined and agreed upon?"
Shadowrun,3beo7l,D_Keller,2,Sun Jun 28 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"The hub generally doesn't do homebrew stuff. Think of the amount of effort it would take to go through and consider and agree upon the materials contained in all the equipment in the book, Then all the stuff in the world and everything else.  However, its something that ""obvious"" things, like Fire, water, ice. Should all be viable things if someone chose. So the whole spell itself shouldn't just be outed.  As I said it hasn't come up for the hub yet. We tend to address things as they come up. As otherwise the discussion about ""what should we address next"" would just run in circles forever."
Shadowrun,3beo7l,Bamce,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:02:55 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
Shadowrun,3beo7l,D_Keller,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"Right now me and my group of GMs have sort of outlined a list of things that should cover just about everything I want to do. Armorcloth (since they don't say what ballistic cloth is made of in SR, could be kevlar or something else), Plasteel, Plasticrete, Ferrocrete, Concrete, Ceramic, Asphalt, Steel, and Titanium was what we decided on to cover just about everything I'd likely run into while running. Checking with them now though to see if they'd allow a bit more broad-strokes in categories of materials."

My spells were Heal and Increased Reflexes for utility and then Shape (Water,  Air,  Fire,  Soil,  Rock,  Concrete,  Plasteel,  and Ferrocrete). I think I also bought Fling as a bonus since being able to grab large chunks of almost any element and throw them at people is quite fun."

Fire, Water, Wood, Mud, Ice, Gold, Lead, Silver, Steel, PlastiCrete, Concrete, Stone, Plastic, Glass, PlasSteel, Iron, Lava, Aluminum and Fashion (hey, clothes are people too!).     With all this, he does pretty much as was indicated in previous posts.

Shadowrun,3beo7l,Sebbychou,2,Tue Jun 30 00:14:32 2015 UTC,"Be prepared that one day, you'll glitch and the building you were making a giant hole in the foundations collapses.  Also, there's something confusing in that spell, it says it has to be inorganic material, but Wood is used as an exemple in the lower section of the spell...  Personally, as a GM, I'd run the spell in the following way:   Spell target descriptor would be broad as the spell descriptor written in the first lines of the spell. Anything that is/was an organic compound or had an Aura is right out. This eliminates most carbon-based material and plastics. (Concrete) wouldn't move the iron bar and grating within, but most of that stuff isn't really hard to remove with tools or another spell   There are some less obvious things of course that you need to remember   You cannot replace the material exactly as it was. You are, after all, making repairs as this point (making a hole in a concrete wall and the patching it up. While you can make it visually hidden like good repairs if you the proper skills/KNO skills (unless it was painted), it is still structurally unsound and forensics will have a easy time spotting it. Everyone always forgets about electricals and piping.   Remember Magic and spells like that exists for over 60 years now. It's a well known security liability and you can assume protection from it in at least secured buildings is commonplace. (Not particularly difficult since it's just adding random meshes/covering). Put thin layers of interlocking wood, plastics, foam and insulation (like a quarter inch thick) and a closed-system conductive wire accross the structure and you made the thing near un-holeable without tripping at least one alarm. Of course, on the other hand cheap/temporary buildings were probably built with that spell to begin with and would be sensitive to it. (I am now picturing a Shaman's wilderness bunker...)  Lastly...   Basically, I'm devoting 9 of my 10 spell slots to variations of Shape [Material]   Don't do that. That's trying to game a system.  Edit: Shape [Air]/[Fire]/[Water] is kinda cool. Didn't really notice these existed before."

There's the general target with base drain.  Then limited target with less drain.  Then specific target with even less drain.  Granularity should likely match the [critter] Form spell compared to Shapechange."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,DrLoaky,23,Mon Jun 29 10:03:24 2015 UTC,"It's true that a bad roll will mean that all your hard-earned investments (or your opponents' toughness) will be bypassed easily. But a lot of what you're complaining about, especially Magic, implies a lack of ""atmosphere"" in the game.   Firstly, Power Armour is Hardened so it'll at least remove half of its rating from the damage dealt to it unless the AP on the attack is huge. Secondly, yeah, that does mean that a really poor roll with 30 dice can mean that you get knocked out with a fork. The game isn't a simulation by any means. Too many modifiers is absolutely correct. CGL has focused on being so granular with these things, the entire game focuses on that, and it's heavy on crunch. But the GM is the final arbiter in such things, and most of these modifiers are natural consequences of some things. I haven't found it to be too distracting: I say there's a -5 penalty to someone and they subtract that many dice, but it does get tiresome keeping track of all of it. This is true. The Matrix, even Astral space, slows down the game. That is, if you consider ""the game"" to be shooting/spellslinging. Just one camera you say? Why isn't the entire team involved in sneaking in, distracting the guards, planting a data tap, or holding off enemy reinforcements? That's poor design on a run.  No, it doesn't mean they're a glass cannon. Averages are the most useful here, not the potential of really bad rolls. But yes, Shadowrun does try to be less ""gamey"" and a lot more lethal.    The game isn't about combat. It devotes a lot of rules towards combat because the rest of the game is up to the GM.   Your balancing notes:   Yes, Initiative Passes are still dominant in the game. That's the way it always has been. You move first and you kill the enemy before they do the same. Its Immunity to Normal Weapons means that someone out there with a taser or Stick-n-Shock should bypass that. But yeah, Spirits are powerful. A level 14 Spirit is nothing to sneeze at, in fact it's a very powerful Spirit that should have used Edge to resist its summoning.  Circles? Also, do you understand that these spells are ""Sustained"" spells? You'll need a lot of Foci to keep them up, plus the Focused Concentration ability, or you'll suffer a -2 penalty (for each Sustained spell) on everything you do.  The Awakened classes are very karma dependent.       The game is unbalanced. Magic is powerful. But a lack of understanding of the setting will make Magic even more powerful.   Firstly, have you read about Background Counts? Most areas will have a Background Count of 1-3, and some even common areas can go up to 6. Those numbers are penalties to Magical actions. High power Spirits? Those are intelligent beings who do not like being enslaved. Did you know dismissing a Spirit won't force it to return to the Astral? What do you think someone as powerful as a Force 14 Spirit will do after a Magician relinquishes its hold over it? Also, the same logic as your armour argument can be applied here. What if the Mage rolls poorly on his drain resistance tests? He can knock himself out quite easily with just a few castings. Does that make Magic useless?  Secondly, Shadowrun isn't a game about combat or dungeon crawling. This isn't DnD. The standard setting is that you're a criminal for hire in a surveillance state of a world. Unless you've been casting those Fireballs at some SINless gangers out in the Barrens, those Astral Signatures will last for hours. That means the police will come looking for you, or the corps themselves.   Deckers are more useful during the legwork phase. And it's up to the GM to make sure everyone else isn't just sitting around. Riggers have less sturdy drones now, but they can pile on a lot of bonuses and shoot stuff dead really well. They also provide physical overwatch options with lots of small drones watching for patrols and so on.   I find it odd that you didn't mention Faces, and that you spoke of ""classes"". You have a very combat oriented view of the game, and that's fine on its own, but it's not the default Shadowrun game. You worry about Magic? Well, the corps have infinite resources and good PR. What's stopping them from flinging a Force 14 Fireball a you, since your team has been doing it so often? Why haven't they managed to track you down and force you to work for them, seeing as how rare Awakened are and trained Awakened are even rarer. Why aren't you fighting Spirits? Some lowly gangs have Shaman among them, and surely that place of business you're attacking would have bought a contract with someone that'll provide magical support. With all the fireworks going off, the police should've responded.  This isn't just a combat game, it's too clunky for that. Most of the game is done in the legwork stage, planning heists and figuring out how deep in the drek you are. If you're thinking of a mercenary type game them it balances itself--nothing's stopping the opposition from having those same advantages or disadvantages."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,marwynn,-3,Mon Jun 29 10:43:03 2015 UTC,I think the books do not really provide good options for a Gamemaster to counter characters.. like what can happen if you cast a level 14 Fireball. They talk about all mighty corps but there is nothing specific how they react to different types of shadowrunners.
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,Sturm_the_Radio_Mann,10,Mon Jun 29 11:24:53 2015 UTC,"Some corps have powerful security forces to take on Shadowrunners, but their main advantage and their main counter is nearly infinite resources.  If you cast a Force 14 fireball, the corp might not have a way to defend or react to it immediately. But they have the resources to find that now glaringly obvious astral signature, hire a security team or even other Shadowrunners, and track you and your team down. And when they find you, you're going to wish you could pull out more of those Force 14 fireballs. Or they'll stealthily put in security measures against that kind of magic. The more you go loud and obvious, the more corpsec is going to upgrade to defend against you.  That is why corps are powerful in Shadowrun. They see all, they control all, and have more nuyen than you can dream of."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,Zemalac,10,Mon Jun 29 11:51:32 2015 UTC,"If you cast a force 14 fireball, you kill everyone in the room. Congratulations. Five minutes later, you get turned into red mist by the High Threat Response team that is summoned by your blindingly obvious use of high-powered magic.  In any game I've ever run or played in, using a fireball of that level would indicate that the mission had failed, and failed badly. Even if you're going for a straight-up terrorist bombing, there are better ways of doing that which don't require being in line-of-sight."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,viper459,2,Mon Jun 29 14:40:03 2015 UTC,the specific? if a corp were to come down on a team of 4 little shadowrunners there'd most likely be nothing left aftewards. That is pretty implicit in the setting.
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,zarzak,-7,Mon Jun 29 11:30:32 2015 UTC,"It may be 'implicit', but mechanically speaking its not necessarily possible."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,viper459,6,Mon Jun 29 11:53:54 2015 UTC,"It's impossible for a GM to send four teams of elite corp forces, break into every single one of your character's houses and kill them in their sleep? i think not, there are plenty of mechanics for that. Not sure what you're saying here, but the original point remains: it's up to the GM to give you harsh consequences for your actions in what is meant to be a harsh world."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,zarzak,-1,Mon Jun 29 12:54:33 2015 UTC,"That assumes characters don't have good home defense/alert systems, etc. etc.  Then you get into a mechanical discussion, which can go either way unless the GM turns the difficulty up several (potentially nonsensical) notches.  In any rpg the GM can 'win' at any time, because the GM doesn't need to follow any sort of rules/structure/whatever.  That doesn't detract from the overall balance argument of the game.  DnD 3.5, for example, was terribly balanced (where you could literally make characters that were infinitely powerful), but the GM could still always 'win'.  But using that as an argument doesn't negate the balance issues in the game."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,dethstrobe,3,Mon Jun 29 13:21:56 2015 UTC,"The more tricks the PCs can do to protect their home, the GM can use those same defenses in corporate facilities.  Say you make a safe house with all the bells and whistles, patrolling drones, pressure plates, Matrix hardline, etc. Why would the corporations now be using those exact same security measures?  Whatever the PCs can do the NPCs can do."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,viper459,3,Mon Jun 29 14:20:42 2015 UTC,"look, your convulted argument aside, if you want to play shadowrun without caring about the setting, then yes, there is no balance in the world. a shadowrunner is meant to be an ant, a nothing to a corporation, and if you go around slinging F14 fireballs, slicing people in half, blowing shit up and or summoning huge and powerful spirits, there's going to be consequences necessitated by the setting. It's completely and 100% up to the GM to enforce these consequences, but according to the setting and the world of shadowrun any GM who had players who play that ridiculously has a free pass to do anything he wants to them.  TL;DR: shadowrunners are good, but a Corp is above ANY Shadowrunner. if your GM ignores this, that's on him, not a fault of the rules."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,itscoolbroh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:36:40 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the rules could do a much better job of enforcing that in a mechanical and thematically appropriate way.  The major SIN (lololol) of many popular mainstream games (D&D, Shadowrun, etc) is that they provide you a game balanced around a combat engine, but espouse an entirely different way of playing that goes beyond endless rounds of combat.  If the corps have the power to rain hell down on the runners with infinite resources, then there should be a mechanic that allows you to do so within the confines of the rules. If it's 'just up to the GM' to maintain the world's thematic underpinnings, then the game has failed as a rules text.  Certainly the game can work really, really well with good GMs, but if the game doesn't teach you how to be a good GM and make being a good GM as easy as possible (note that I didn't say easy, I just said as easy as possible), it's missing some pieces."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,dr_pibby,0,Tue Jun 30 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"Despite how powerful the players or the DM might be, roleplaying games are not about players or the DM 'winning' with optimization despite the fact that games can be played that way.

Shadowrun,3bhu4m,Zemalac,3,Tue Jun 30 00:48:16 2015 UTC,"I've seen experienced runners go down to stray bullets in firefights they weren't even a part of. Characters dying is always possible, at any moment of the game. And if you fuck up badly enough, your GM is running the setting wrong if consequences don't fall back on your unwary head.  If you want to run the setting lighter and softer, okay, fine. But never say it's mechanically impossible for your character to be killed, because that just ain't true, omae."

Being the driver isn't enough of a role to make a character out of (and even if vehicle combat comes into play, then you've got the matrix problem where only one character can really effectively play the game, the others are just waiting) ... so then you've got to do drones (since you spent all that money on a control rig, otherwise its useless).

Keep out of sight and out of the line of fire, and hotsim initiative on a physical combatant can do a lot for you. It's really the RCC rigger (as opposed to the control rig rigger) that isn't worth doing right now--drones are just too fragile to have more than a carefully-deployed one with rigger dodge bonuses deployed."

Shadowrun,3bhu4m,xcbsmith,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:05:02 2015 UTC,"Level 14 Fireball...  Okay, so that's 13 drain. You roll bad, you are dead or knocked out and the HTR team has you without a fight. Let's say you roll well though... you probably still exceeded your physical limit, so there's that. Let's say you rolled really, really well and you are still standing with a handful of stun damage.  You just did 14DV-14AP (plus any net hits) damage to everyone in the room. You actually might not have killed everyone in the room, but unless there is a really tough tank with some serious fire protection or someone with a lot of hardened armour, you probably have at least knocked them unconscious. Of course, if they dropped a grenade before you got that off, that's going to go off, and that'll almost certainly take you out. If there is anyone outside the room, they will almost certainly take you out. If there is anyone from your party who was in the room... you took them out too. If the room was small... you took yourself out. ;-). Those spirits you mentioned as being so powerful? There is a really, really good chance that any spirit tied to the corp is now on your a** and they'll arrive on the scene immediately thanks to their dual nature. Oh, and a lot of things are on fire now, so the fire alarm is going off and you better find a way to get out of the building without getting burned to a crisp. I hope you don't need magic to get out, because most of your spell casting will impose enough drain to take out what little bit of life is left in you. This all presupposes the ""geek the mage first"" mentality didn't mean you were killed before you ever fired a shot (I hope your sneaking is really good!).  So yes, it is terribly powerful. It also has terrible costs and consequences. There is a very good chance you'll either knock yourself out or weaken yourself to the point you will be thrown in jail for a multiple homicide. Even if you don't, you will have needed to plan your actions out carefully to avoid killing your team and/or finding yourself trapped in a situation you can't get out of."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,Valanthos,10,Wed Jul 1 02:04:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to politely disagree with some of your opinions.   Armour is worthless.   Every bit of soak counts. An extra three points of soak is roughly one point of damage that you will be ignoring. Many attacks will only be doing around eight or so damage unless people are bringing their bigger and much more uncommon guns to play. 30 Soak means anything under 10 is almost entirely ignored, that means Ares Predator gunshots bounce off your character. Sure at the end of the day if someone brings a big enough gun you're gonna get wasted, but that's a little like real life.   Combat is way too complicated   Once you get used to it combat is a breeze. It's no more complicated than D&D or any of the other crunchy systems. I can have an initiative pass take a minute easy with some experienced players.   Matrix slows down the game.   Once again, once you get experienced with it it doesn't take too long in fifth to do things. Especially when you flick back to reality instead of having big matrix only sessions.   Every Shadowrunner is a glass cannon.   People are like that. At the end of the day people are fragile creatures when bullets get involved. Shadowrun is lethal on purpose, and frankly for me I feel it's not as lethal as it could be.   Spirits are way too strong   Runners aren't the only people with spirits omae. There is all sorts of anti-astral security as well. Hell this doesn't even account for the fact that you can't just constantly use spirits without reprecussions.   Reflex boost is way too strong/too hard for mundanes to get it   A mundie can get a real cheap +1/2D6 initiative boost in the form of Jazz. And sure you have to spend a lot of nuyen to get some permanent implants but implants do a lot of things far better than any magical trickery.    Spells are too strong   Spells come with all sorts of disadvantages... Improving your attributes or reflexes comes with sustaining penalties. Drain is a near omnipresent issue for mages. Sure they got some mojo, but it's takes a little from them every time.   Start combat cast a F8-12 Opium Den or Fireball   Magic can wipe out a room, sure if they don't have any astral support. Just like a street samurai can clear a room of mages if they don't have any physical support. Or a Decker can turn the environment against a group if they don't have any matrix support.  Furthermore, this is typically the reason, geek the mage is a thing. Mages typically won't go first... meaning that they can often get dropped before they get to pull their big I WIN switch.   Adepts are better than Street Samurais   HAHAHAHA... Where did you get this delightful idea omae? Street Samurais are usually tougher, with better gear and only a little bit slower with a decent dicepool in combat.    Weakest classes: Technomancer, Rigger, Decker   Deckers are the kings. Decking if done cleverly can be a real game changer. Sure he might not be as tough when combat begins but they have so much utility outside of combat that I'd never ever call them the weakest archetype.   Riggers are also all kinds of amazing... thinking of them as a weaker form of summoners is bullshit. Drones have so much utility that spirits don't have and spirits have all sorts of drawbacks drones don't have. Spirits also are a bit ""machinery blind""... meaning that kind of 'weaker spirit' has all sorts of advantages against spirits. Furthermore it doesn't end with drones... A vehicle to move around in can be a real beast if used correctly and outfitted properly. You can potentially dish out 24P -6AP with a good ram attack in an SK Bentley. Not many spirits can survive that."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,NobleFool,3,Mon Jun 29 12:30:46 2015 UTC,"Also of note, attempting to tier classes is like comparing apples to oranges. They're all good at something different or a different aspect of their focus, which is why 4 mystads can't mop the floor with every situation, even though you could technically cover all of your bases with that team. Eventually you just hit the situation where, gee, I wish we had a dedicated decker because the spider has similar skills to our adept with decking skills and with him defending the host we can't make any progress because the internal security system is going to lock us out (Or similar)."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,Valanthos,2,Mon Jun 29 17:50:21 2015 UTC,Yeah at the end of the day any archetype can prove to be really useful. You'll always regret not having someone who's dedicated at one particular type of thing.
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,bbsr,4,Tue Jun 30 01:26:31 2015 UTC,"So in general the thing you need to remember is that Shadowrun is an RPG not a tabletop skirmish game or a computer game. Balance is somewhat irrelevant because the GM can make a runa s fair or unfair as he likes and always ahs mroe tools at his disposal than the PCs. Oh you routinely like to summon F14 spirits? On your next run an F18 free spirit appears to teach your mage a lesson about respecting the rights of spirit kind. That kind of thing.  Balance is only relevant between classes so that no players feel like they're useless during a run or that, for example, the mage can do everything herself. I would agree with you that this is actually an issue in SR particularly with riggers and TMs who generally have less options that street sams, mages, faces, adepts and deckers and so get used less often. Both still bring some unique tricks to the table though and so long as you don'ty have both a decker and a TM in your party TMs are usable for players.  To address your specific points.    quoted text -Armor is worthless Let's assume you have +25 Armor and 5 Body, thats 30 dice. So let's say that attack hits you for 14S Damage because you have high armor. If you are unlucky you will be knocked out with one single shot. If you have 6 net hits you get hit with 8S but the second attak will knock you out... and +25 Armor is like Powerarmor. You can be knocked out by a Guy with a Fork if you have bad luck... that alone is just stupid. > quoted text   A few caveats, 14S is pretty high you're talking grenades there or decent combat magic  and most of the time you won't be facing grenades or combat magic becasue this is a setting where people don't routinely walk around carrying grenades. Also, combat in SR is supposed to be deadly, the idea is that you don't want to be in combat unless the odds are heaviyl stacked in your favour. This isn't D'n'D where you wade into the goblin horde and hack away with impunity (not to say that's a bad way to enjoy a  game, it's just not what SR is) if you're getting shot at you should feel scared that your character may die.  But realistically with 30 soak dice vs 14 damage you'll take 4-5 boxes of damage. Enough to hurt but not enough to drop that Body 5 street Sam.   quoted text -Combat is way to complicated there are so many modifiers it really slows down the game, you have to check enviromental effects, situational effects, effects on your character (like -2 if you have wounds), Perks that will change somehthing, ammo, weapon addons... so much stuff. Even a tabletop game that has it's focus on combat is not that complicated. > quoted text   This is a GM thing entirely. He can add as many modifiers as he feels are relevant. You don't have to obey every rule and think about whether it's raining, what the distance is, how is the visibility for every single shot. He only really has to apply them when it's narratively important. If your GM spends 10 minutes looking up the correct mods for every shot and you guys find that boring, tell him not to do it.   quoted text-Matrix slows down the game The Matrix is nice and sounds cool but in a group there will be only one guy who can hack most of the time. So he plays his hacking game and the other players just sit there and wait for 30min while he is hacking that one camera nobody cares about.> quoted text   Again, totally a GM issue. It shouldn't take 30 minutes to hack a single camera, that's what, 2 actions? Get 1 mark, edit file? That takes no time at all. And again the GM only has to make the players roll dice when failure is important to the story. He's entirely at liberty to just let the decker hack the cameras without rolling dice if it speeds up gameplay.  He should give the matrix guy on the team stuff to do though and make it relevant to you all. Don't take a break from the other characters whilst the decker is decking but have it happen at the same time as you're desperately outrunning cops or trying to break into the building. or just describe the matrix setting more evocatively. This is a party of the game where hackign a camera could be visualised as godzilla tearing down a city to get to mech-godzilla and burn him enough to get a mark.   quoted text-Every Shadowrunner is a glascannon Because of the way how Armor works you can not build a sturdy character. You need high initiative and powerful attacks to survive.> quoted text Not, even, remotely. Yes, they're less sturdy than most RPG characters but my friend built a 55 soak dice Troll out of chargen for a run last week, she literally strolled into suppressive fire and took 2 boxes of damage as she slowly walked down the hall into a hail of bulelts and calmly twisted the barrel of the gun round.  quoted text Spirits are way too strong A Spirit is a Deathmachine... put some edge in and summon a level 8 or 9 Spirit and the Fight is over. That thing will kill everything. It's just stupid how powerful they are (level 8 = 8AP), and if they die you can just summon a new one. > quoted text   And the GM can summon spirits too. Bigger ones. And he can appyl the rules for spirit index from Street Grimoire and make it so your mage that abuses his spirits suddenly finds himself withou friends. And Ares HTRT can show up to investigate this rogue summoner that keeps uleashing high powered spirits into the middle fo downtown Seattle. Again, the GM can always brign out bigger guns than the PC's and in a game that rewards being sneaky throwing around powerful spirits is a good way to get noiced and get killed.   quoted text And the Street Grimoire made Spirits even more powerful. Like the spell Ally spirit,... unlimited services.> quoted text   Ally spirits are nice but not that pwoerful when you consider how much karma they cost.   quoted text -Spells are too strong I don't understand why there are no circles or anything like that. Some Spells are really really powerful: Increase Attribute (Drain-Attriube), Increase Reflexes, Opium Den, Fireball, Physical Barrier, Heal These Spells are much stronger than the other ones... before combat buff yourself increase Attribute to resist more drain. After that you cast increase reflexes so you are first in combat. Now start combat and cast a level 8-12 Opium den or Fireball. both of these Spells make your enemies either stuned or dead. > quoted text   Why is your GM letting you cast spells before combat? Surprise rounds can break this trick. Oh, you walka roudn with increased attribute cast on yourself constantly? Well then now you have to sneak through the mana barrier, or get pulled over by an awakened cop who wants to know why you're sustaining a spell on yourself, or atatcked by a curious spirit hanging around in the astral, or not allowed in the cklub becasue the awakened bouncer thinks you're up to something.  And those strong spells you've been casting, they leave an imprint fo you behind. One the cops can trace, and if you've been doing naughty things likec asting opium den, an illegal spell, or fireball. Well you best believe they're going to track you down omae.   quoted textdecker: I don't know much about them but I think hacking in general has way to many drawbacks.> quoted text   Hacking is how you do nearly anything. For most standard runs you need the hacker not to support the team but to actually achieve the objective. During the legwork the decker and the face are the ones that track down leads, set you up with the fake ID to get into the building dressed as plumbers, hacked the payroll to get you minimal security clearance, secure the paydata, get rid of the data bomb that would otherwise very much offend your Mr Johnson, and clean up after your messes so the cops don't come knocking.   And if its a run that doesn't need the decker per se they can still support by shutting down cameras, stealing cars, bricking guns and cyberware, etc.  Really if you'e playing SR as it's intended then you should always have a mage, a decker and a street sam (or an adept) and each run should involve elements of hacking, beating magical security and good old fashioned theft and violence. What they should not necessarily involve is any combat at all. It sounds to me like you guys are very hung up on combat which is not what SR as a system is built to be about. Again, not wrong if youl like an RPG with ltos of fighting but SR is probably not the game for you."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,zarzak,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:42:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of what you're saying is GM prerogative, which isn't relevant to discussing how well balanced the rules themselves are.  Having the GM ignore roll, add/remove modifiers at will, do whatever/etc is 'allowed' but is outside of the rules of the game.  In fact, if thats your playstyle why even play shadowrun (which is a very granular game from a rules perspective) - why not play FATE in a shadowrun setting."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,bbsr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:56:27 2015 UTC,"I was addressing the fact the the original poster felt modifiers slowed down the game too much. I personally really enjoy the crunch and my group uses most of the modifiers mosty of the time so in combat we're taking into account stuff like wound penalties, distance, recoil, running ,etc and have never found they slow down the game. But if you feel they do, don't use them.  Or more specifically, don't invoke situations as a GM where the modifiers will be relevant. If you find working out the weather and the distance to be a pain then make every encounter happens on a clear day at close distance. If you find it tedious to go through hacking roles for every security camera then either use the buy successes rule (which is in the book) to let your decker hack the cameras quick and easy or just make it so there aren't any cameras."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,SkinJumper,10,Mon Jun 29 13:31:15 2015 UTC,"Armor is worthless Let's assume you have +25 Armor and 5 Body, thats 30 dice.

You can be knocked out by a Guy with a Fork if you have bad luck... that alone is just stupid.     First, 14 damage is actually really high, like a grenade landing right next to you bad.  If you are getting hit with that kind of power, more than likely you will have a bunch of Karma and should be playing smarter.  Going up with a guy with that kind of firepower is pretty stupid.    Sure, there are ways to get that kind of damage with lower damage rating, but you'd be extremely lucky.  A mage can do it by overcasting a spell, but they will be facing anywhere from 10 to 14 stun with around 12-14 or so soak dice, meaning they will be getting 5 0r 6 damage which is not resisted.  I have only seen damage like that 4 or 5 times in my time playing and all of the times it either almost killed the character or the character was extremely advanced.   -Combat is way to complicated there are so many modifiers it really slows down the game, you have to check enviromental effects, situational effects, effects on your character (like -2 if you have wounds), Perks that will change somehthing, ammo, weapon addons... so much stuff. Even a tabletop game that has it's focus on combat is not that complicated.     Combat can be rough, but once you get the hang of it, it takes only a little more time that Pathfinder or D&D.     -Matrix slows down the game The Matrix is nice and sounds cool but in a group there will be only one guy who can hack most of the time. So he plays his hacking game and the other players just sit there and wait for 30min while he is hacking that one camera nobody cares about.     Your GM and group needs to temper that more.  If you have matrix characters in your game, they should be doing something each run, but if it is taking more than 5 or 10 minutes the GM needs to change the game.  This isn't Shadowrun's fault.  In D&D a mage could be doing some astral travel by himself or a thief is doing some recon, both of which can take forever.    -reflexboost is too strong (+4/5w6) anything that will boost your reflexes is very strong. You can do more and you are most likely the first to shoot. If you are a Magician/Mystic you just need one spell and an Adept can simply get improved reflexes + some foci to get his +4W6. All other classes have to put a lot of money down to get this upgrade. And it's a musthave in combat situations.    Street Samurai can get this high as well.  If Adepts are spending not only cash, but karma on their Foci.  I have a street sam that is rocking 11+3d6 or 12+5d6 if I am on drugs.  Also, you can use edge to go first or roll 5d6 anytime you want.     Spirits are way too strong     Not at all, remember both teams have spirits.  Also, unless spirits are manifested, they cannot attack anything on the physical plane.  They also can be dispelled with a skill check or two.  Most runner mages have between 12 and 14 summoning dice.  If they summon a F8 or 9 spirit the spirit is resisting with 8 or 9 dice.  The drain is twice the number of hits the spirit gets.  If the spirit rolls average it will get about 3 hits, which makes the mage resist 6 damage with 12 dice.  If you bind it you are looking at it rolling twice the number of dice.    I think you have had a bad experience with it so far and might need to find a better group.  I have found it as balanced, if not more balanced, than D&D."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,zarzak,2,Mon Jun 29 10:25:37 2015 UTC,"I've never seen anything in DnD take up time like a matrix run takes up time ...  Street Samurai has to expend an incredible amount of resources to get a strong initiative out of CharGen, as opposed to an adept/mage which has to expend a trifling amount.  Cyber/Bioware is now very expensive, and if you use missions level nuyen rewards you'll basically never be buying an upgrade.  Spirits are certainly far too strong - its not hard to make a character that out of chargen can summon/bind high force spirits while only taking a small (if any) amount of drain.  Shadowrun is a fun setting, but mechanically the game is nowhere near balanced ..."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,SkinJumper,2,Mon Jun 29 11:52:22 2015 UTC,"If you aren't readily familiar with matrix runs, it will take longer.  However you have ultimate control over how long each piece takes, so that's on your group.     Street Samurai has to expend an incredible amount of resources to get a strong initiative out of CharGen, as opposed to an adept/mage which has to expend a trifling amount. Cyber/Bioware is now very expensive, and if you use missions level nuyen rewards you'll basically never be buying an upgrade.     That's why the character generation system is built like it is.  Why else would a character start out with 450,000 nuyen to use to buy gear and only 5000 can be held over into the game?  Cyber/Bio ware are major character upgrades and should be treated as such, literally nothing is stopping you from giving them out as story arc rewards.  Also look at some of the pre-drawn modules,  I ran my group through Splintered State and they each walked away with 50,000 nuyen a piece, a bunch of karma, and 2 contacts.      Spirits are certainly far too strong - its not hard to make a character that out of chargen can summon/bind high force spirits while only taking a small (if any) amount of drain.     Yes it is hard and when you do you are a lopsided, one-dimensional character that no Johnson would hire for anything except a run involving spirits.  How much fun is it sitting out most of your runs?  This is again something you have to take up with your GM.    Shadowrun is fine if you aren't into munchkining your character.  I am now sure you aren't actually very familiar with the rules."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,zarzak,2,Mon Jun 29 15:48:02 2015 UTC,"First - take a look at the expected run rewards on page 371-372.  You're looking at 2-3k to ~20k max (for the most dangerous runs).  You also get a few karma (2-7ish or so, with some variance).  Lets now flip on over to gear costs: Each standard grade synaptic booster costs 95k.  Alternatively, going from Wired Reflexes 2->3 costs 68k.  Thats 10-20 runs or so to upgrade your central offensive/defensive item ... and mages/mystic adepts get better out of chargen.  Karma-wise a mage/mystic adept can initiate after just a few runs.  You might say 'oh, but I can use drugs', and this is true - but you risk addiction and all the fun rp problems that come with trying to get drugs.  As for spirits: Have you tried making a character that can easily summon high force spirits out of chargen?  Because if you have, you'd know you don't need to make a lopsided character to do it.  Take an elf.  Give them magic 6, charisma 8, will 5.  Give them max ranks in binding and/or summoning, with a specialization (say air spirits).  Give them a mentor spirit that specializes in air spirits, and a focus (say a power focus, to make their spellcasting better too). There: with barely any investment in resources that you wouldn't have taken anyways as a mage you're throwing 16 dice + your focus to summon air spirits ... and this is before reagents, and before edge.  Reagents of course make this a much easier task, and edge makes it very difficult to fail.  You'll of course have skill points left for spellcasting/counterspelling, perception, sneaking, some etiquette ... you'll have stat points left for whatever ... and you're a mage, so you have all your spells.  Matrix Runs are unlike things in other games in that non-matrix people have literally nothing to do during them.  Whether you shorten it or not, thats still a mechanic thats uneven from a playability perspective.  Not sure why you're defending shadowrun's mechanics.  Its a fun game, and a fun world - but it is decidedly not balanced."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,SkinJumper,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"Have you actually played Shadowrun 5e with a decent group?  I have a street sam character with 100 karma and have yet to actually need an upgraded system.  Also, that's what contacts are for.  Get a contact that can give you deals.  Remember in Shadowrun if you need something you have to go find it.  Go find a contact.    Spirits: *  There aren't any that specialize in Air Spirits. *  A power focus not only costs 6k nuyen, it costs 6 karma as well.  If you are taking Magic at A or B, the max you will have is around 100k nuyen and that's if you take it at C, but then you have to take Elf and B and that is a bad idea.  D hits at 50k and E is only 6k.  You also need to buy your other actual gear.     You are overestimating reagents.  Summoning reagents are used to set the limit.  If you want to set a limit of 8 you are using 8 drams of reagents.  That's all it does for summoning.   If you are an elf you are going to have 3 edge.  Do you really want  to use it to summon an elemental that will give you one or two tasks?     Matrix Runs:      Take D&D.  If your rogue is robbing someone or doing some scouting, what is the rest of the team doing?  Nothing.  They have to hold back.  Like I said before, if your in a game and the matrix run is taking a bulk of the time, that is something for your GM to discuss.  It has nothing to do with Shadowrun being balanced."

Shadowrun,3bhu4m,zarzak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:19:41 2015 UTC,"Anything else is GM discretion, and isn't really something that should be brought up in a discussion of game mechanics.  Yes; GMs can augment that (and I'd argue that they certainly should).  But a fresh GM won't know that, and nor should they.  The book says that a few thousand nuyen is the appropriate amount for a run, and thats what you would give.  That presents a balance/mechanical issue.  If you have any situation in which a GM has to intervene from a mechanical perspective to 'fix' things then the mechanics of the game have a problem."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,PinkTrench,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:20:03 2015 UTC,"While the Matrix did do that in older editions, in 5e the Matrix is tied into meatspace wonderfully.

Shadowrun,3bhu4m,xcbsmith,0,Mon Jun 29 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"Street Samurai has to expend an incredible amount of resources to get a strong initiative out of CharGen, as opposed to an adept/mage which has to expend a trifling amount. Cyber/Bioware is now very expensive, and if you use missions level nuyen rewards you'll basically never be buying an upgrade.   Cyber/bioware sure isn't cheap, but an adept is burning the majority of their PP just to get Improved Reflexes lvl 3, which is the moral equivalent wired reflexes 3, which costs you more than half the money a runner starts out with if they slot money as #1 (of course, at 20R, you can't get that to start without Restricted Gear, but arguably WR2 + RE3 is a better deal anyway).  So yeah, I think Adepts do have a speed advantage. It's not a huge one though. I'd say it is worth maybe 5 initiative points, which isn't necessarily even an extra attack. On the flip side though, going the augment track gets you a smart link, an ability to have bonuses to non-physical attributes (logic, and now intuition), much better ability to soak up damage (platelet factories are just soo awesome), and of course they can more cheaply get strength & agility bumps.  Adepts have their advantages, and initiative is one of them. You could come up with stories for all the different archtypes. That's how it is supposed to work."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,xcbsmith,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:18:25 2015 UTC,"Just to provide a specific example...  If you are going to go with a Troll Adept, you'll probably go with attributes & meta in the A&B slots and magic in the C slot, with 6 magic. With Troll mundane, you go with resources in the A), meta in the B, and C) in the attribute slots.  If you go with WR2 & RE3 (used), you bun 4.12 essence (so forget about social niceties), but you have +5 reaction and +2w6 for initiative. That's less than 180K out of pocket, so you still have neuyen 270K for all your other fun features. On average that works out to 0.5 initiative less than an Adept with 3 levels of improved reflexes. Said adept has burned 3.5 PP, and has 2.5 PP left for fun and games. That 2.5 PP will let them get 2 levels of improved agility and 1 level of improved ability, and then they have to start burning money and karma on foci to get anything more. Meanwhile, the mundane can get the equivalent by spending 64K on two levels of muscle toner, and 16K on one reflex recorder and still have 190K left for fun and games, which is easily more cash than the Adept will have.  If you are willing to burn 10 Karma for Restricted Gear and burn some money to save essence, now you have WR3 (alpha) & RE3 (used). You've burned 300K out of pocket, but now you have +6 reaction and +3d6 to your initiative rolls. To try to match, the Adept could get Exceptional Attribute Magic and go up to level 7, but that is 14 karma and they still only got to +4 reaction and +3d6 initiative... and the mundane still has 150K and 4 karma to spend on other stuff that the Adept has to get by with 2.5 PP (which I already showed doesn't match up to that for simple Agility/Skill boost motifs).  Of course, it sucks to lose essence, but hey... game balance, right?"
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,zarzak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:10:45 2015 UTC,"But the thing is ... you can sacrifice a point of essence as an adept for all those nice soak augmentations (they're not obscenely expensive) and a smartlink, and still be in great shape.  Street Sams also don't care about logic, and have other things to spend money on than an intuition booster.  Don't get me wrong - I like street sams; I think they're fun to play, and fun to think about, etc. etc.  But from a purely mechanical point of view there are issues."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,TempusFrangit,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:18:07 2015 UTC,"My first experience with Shadowrun fell a bit flat due to the complexity of the rules. We started with 5th edition and had prior experience with other systems, primarily D&D3.5 and pathfinder. Do you perhaps have any tips to make the game a bit less taxing on both the DM and players? Or do you think it's just something that you'll eventually grow in to?  I think Shadowrun has the best setting out of all the RPGs I have played, but the complexity of the rules is a bit daunting. Especially for players who have never played any sort of RPG before."

But a competent - and more importantly creative - decker can provide some impossibly invaluable support.   When you enter a building the decker can get you access to the security system. He can watch the cameras, monitor security guards, and literally open doors for his team that they might not have had access to. He can disrupt and mislead corpsec, he can access information, he can flip an entire security system on its head. Need to find a specific target? A decker can track him, sure. But a creative decker will track him AND spoof an email from HR to have the guy come down to an office where your team is waiting.  And in combat? Even better. With control of the system a decker can make sure the team never runs into the security team, or prevent the security team from even getting close to the Shadowrunners by barring doors and locking them out. A decker on the run itself can also hack the enemy's guns, communications, and even cybernetics. You might think a decker is useless, right up until he bricks your cyber-eyes.   I can't even think of any current drawbacks that would make the advantages of a decker moot."

So let's say that attack hits you for 14S Damage because you have high armor. If you are unlucky you will be knocked out with one single shot. If you have 6 net hits you get hit with 8S but the second attak will knock you out... and +25 Armor is like Powerarmor. You can be knocked out by a Guy with a Fork if you have bad luck... that alone is just stupid.   First off, 14 damage is a pretty high-power attack. I don't know who this guy with a fork is, but to be dealing that much from what is essentially an unarmed attack he would have to be an augmented troll. At which point, him killing you with a fork is...well, yeah. He's an augmented troll. This makes sense.  Technically, if you have absolutely abysmal luck, you could get one-hit by a normal guy with a fork as well. Welcome to the world. Combat is lethal, avoid it where you can. On average, though, your thirty soak dice should be taking away ten damage from you, which means you're effectively immune to small-arms fire.   Combat is way to complicated there are so many modifiers it really slows down the game   No argument there. My only response is to try to not get into combat a whole lot.   -Matrix slows down the game The Matrix is nice and sounds cool but in a group there will be only one guy who can hack most of the time. So he plays his hacking game and the other players just sit there and wait for 30min while he is hacking that one camera nobody cares about.   Are you perhaps thinking of earlier editions of the game? 4th and 5th fixed this issue pretty thoroughly. What you're describing was a major problem in earlier versions, I understand.   -Every Shadowrunner is a glascannon Because of the way how Armor works you can not build a sturdy character. You need high initiative and powerful attacks to survive.   If you're running with mostly magicians and adepts, this does not surprise me. You can build a street sam straight out of chargen with 40-50 soak dice, if that's what you want to go for. Tech-based combat characters in general tend to be more durable.   -reflexboost is too strong   For combat builds, yeah. Moving fast is important. No argument here, I guess I just don't see how it's a problem.   -Spirits are way too strong   How are your magicians summoning stuff of this high a force without taking huge amounts of drain? Once you have that spirit on the field, yeah, it's going to tear shit up, right until the moment that the corp security mages just about kill themselves ritual-summoning a force 20 juggernaut to counter you.  Remember, anything you can do, the corps can do better. Be smarter than them, because you can't be bigger.   -Spells are too strong   My experience has led to the opposite conclusion, but I think the groups I've been in have played the game a bit differently than you. High-force spells make it super easy to track you down afterwards, which is when you are on the receiving end of a force 10 fireball. Or a hail of .308 from a corpsec sniper team.  Also, again, how are your magicians casting this stuff without huge amounts of drain? Usually you can pull off maybe one high-force spell a session before being out for the count, unless you're spending absolute bales of reagents.   Strongest classes: Magician, Adept, Mystic Somehow viable: streetsamurai (cyberupgrades) Weakest classes: technomancer, rigger, decker   Oh, wow. No. Should be more like this:   Decker Anyone else, who gives a fuck, they're just there to stand between the decker and bullets   This is the Sixth World. Everything is online. A good decker quite literally controls your world. They can kill you from across the city or while looking you in the eye, and you won't even know how. Your car, your gun, your fridge, your damn pants are all his to command, thanks to the ubiquity of wi-fi. A hacker of some kind is the only role that I would consider to be absolutely essential to a team of shadowrunners, unless those runners want to be stuck doing shit jobs in the barrens and backwoods.  Which, you know, could still be an interesting campaign I guess. Sort of a third-world mercenary game.  Some general commentary on your other points:   Adepts and street samurai are different ways of approaching the same problem. One is not better than the other. Adepts tend to be more skilled, while sammies tend to be more durable and have more damage when they do hit (you can make a street sam who cannot be killed by conventional weapons even when he's not wearing any actual armor, while you cannot do the same for an adept--all hail the giga-troll). Adepts' main problems are that they usually start the game super, super poor, and are thus unable to get the good equipment that a sammy will have like five different copies of. Riggers have been kind of screwed in this edition for a while now. Hopefully the rigger book will address this. Daddy needs his vehicle mods, Catalyst! I want my tank drones back! Spells and spirits are only good against enemies that don't have spells and spirits as well. Go up against a corpsec mage with a counterspelling focus and see how well your high-force fireball stacks up against the HTR team then.   This is probably too much writing in response to this post, and I think others have already said most of these points, but damn if I could stop myself from writing it.  EDIT: Fixing typos."

Shadowrun,3bhu4m,Zemalac,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:20:42 2015 UTC,"From my above post:   Usually you can pull off maybe one high-force spell a session before being out for the count, unless you're spending absolute bales of reagents.   Admittedly, that was about casting spells, not summoning spirits. But since reagents don't affect the force of the summoned spirit, but rather replace the limit of the summoning action, I don't really see how they'd be helpful. Reagents are useful for getting more services on lower-level spirits, not summoning high-force spirits. Someone calling up a Force 14 spirit, as in OP's example, would be facing on average 8-10 drain, no matter how many reagents they decide to throw into the mix.  On a related note, let's talk about spellcasting reagents for a moment, with a mind towards costs. To get the equivalent of a force 14 spell, you need to spend 14 reagents. That's 280 nuyen for one moment of fire and fury. A high-explosive grenade, meanwhile, is 100 nuyen. For the same cost as that one spell you could almost get three of 'em. At that price difference it's really more a matter of taste."

This character isn't going to be able to climb, run, swim, carry anything over fifteen kilograms (or 33 pounds, if you're American), or survive anything more than a love tap. S/he is basically a cripple.  Similarly to this, I've made a street sam with 40 soak dice, and a sniper who can hit you with 30 dice from a kilometer away, but just like this summoner those characters are useless for anything else. Building these sorts of extreme minmaxed characters is a lot of fun, but if you're playing them in an actual game they tend to be a lot less useful.  The second build this guy has in the thread you linked is a bit more to my liking. Still kind of gimped, but mostly an effective support mage who happens to be able to call on big badass magic support when required (though that requires a bit of setup on his part).

Any shadowrunning team completely focused on combat would do great against gangers and mafia (maybe), but they should be crushed the minute they try to spend a prolonged engagement with AAA corporations, or extensively use lethal weapons against corporate citizens. Any Renraku or Knight Errant HTR team sent after a situation like that should utterly destroy a 4-5 man shadowrun team. Unless your entire team is setup in middle+ lifestyle, the HTR response team would probably be okay with SINless casualties.  If you're party is focusing on combat, what about legwork? Are you guys doing any? If the run is so easy that you don't have to do much, then I think it's a problem with the challenge of the game.

Almost every Thread, here and on other boards, about Shadowrun doesn't feel satisfying boils down to ""The GM does a poor Job!"".

Shadowrun,3bhu4m,Roxfall,3,Wed Jul 1 21:31:24 2015 UTC,"I think your complaints are coming from a good grasp on the basic mechanics but not an in depth knowledge of a lot of the more fiddly parts of the system.  Like having insane soak dice. So you have 30 armor, and reduce 14p to 4s after your soak test. That means you'll be unconscious after only 3 attacks, making you effectively dead. But here is the thing, you can heal stun damage with slap patches. Which means you effectively have way more stun HP then you do have physical.  I only recommend using all the combat rules if you've mastered the basics. And it sounds like your group is ready for moving on to the more complex. Dropping smoke grenades, taking cover, hacking the lights off and using low light vision to murder people, etc. Having more options allows you to make combat less fair, hopefully for your opposition. So I think you might need to start looking in to them if you feel the normal throw dice at each other and soak is too simple.  I agree that the Matrix is slow. But I think your group is doing it wrong if it takes 30 minutes to hack one camera. A camera shouldn't need to run silent, so you instantly spot it. Then you hack on the fly to mark it. Then do an edit action to loop the camera feed and you're done. There are ways to layer the security to make it take longer, but I don't recommend using that all the time.  I don't think glass canons is a problem. It really help sell the point that you should try and limit combat to times when it's necessary.  Having extra initiative passes (IP) has always been a problem. It was really bad in SR4 when it was a flat, you get extra passes or you don't. I like the roll for initiative better, allows those slow mundanes to get 2 IP every once in a while. Anyway, I do agree that the cost for extra initiative dice is pretty low for the awakened at chargen, which is annoying, but luckily each dice is only worth about +3 init score and it's not even reliable on top of that. So its not the most important stat anymore.  Summoning high force spirits is pretty difficult and has a chance to kill the summoner. A force 9 spirit on average will hit the summoner with 6p drain. And that's on average, sometimes the swing happens and you'll need to soak 10p. That could kill a mage just from over summoning and the luck of the dice. Also, spirits are dual natured, so awakened countermeasures can handle them pretty easily, like other spirits or projecting mages. I'm not saying a force 9 spirit isn't strong, but with a greater knowledge of awaken countermeasures they are not IWIN buttons.  You should have seen all the complaining people did about how nerfed magic had become just because mundane weapons got a buff. Anyway, I think most spells are pretty balanced seeing how drain is a thing."

That's why there's that saying:   ""Geek the mage first""   Plus, everything you talk about is a 2-edged sword.  Players opposition (corps, gov't, etc.) are almost always better equipped and manned.  Plus, the opposition should always have an edge since most adventures will be on their home turf.  The GM should make this so.  Every so often, I like to throw in a few ""You're NOT so tough as you think"" missions against my players.  In my last gaming session, the players went up against Renraku's Red Samurai, magic support, drone support, etc.  They barely survived -- 2 critically wounded and 1 mostly-dead (burnt edge).  One player made 2 unheard of rolls which saved the team twice.  Granted, I agree with some of your arguments.  Like damage resistance can be almost impossible against 16P or 15S damage.  Luckily, players have defensive options that can help them avoid the attack.  In my humble opinion, I think Shadowrun's D6 rules are more realistic than any other system out there."

Shadowrun,3bhu4m,BitRunr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:15:30 2015 UTC,"...and theorycrafting   This is your problem. If you push any game system and iterate aggressively you will find every balance issue. I find the idea of a balanced roleplaying game to be hilarious.   There Magicians with 7 Magic and Adepts with 13+4W6 initiative.   And? That's it? You had me worried for a second.  Going back up to specifics   -Armor is worthless   Armor is meant to keep you from dying miserably to a street punk with a Beretta or Ares Predator. Against opponents with assault rifles, sniper rifles, grenades, APDS, and generally negative attitudes armor is meant to keep you alive when you bail from cover.   -Combat is way to complicated there are so many modifiers   Ranged Combat: Vision, cover, movement, wound, recoil, cyber, magic.  Physical Combat: Vision, cover, movement, wound, cyber, magic, prone, friends in combat, reach.  Magic Combat (direct): Vision, magic.  Magic Combat (indirect): Vision, cover, movement, wound, cyber, magic.  Did I miss anything? If I did it probably doesn't matter because those are the modifiers I use.   -Matrix slows down the game   This is true. But in general this is true of any activity not involving the entire team. Astral scouting, infiltration, information gathering/legwork, negotiation, etc. One of the facets of Shadowrun is that it actually penalizes groups that do everything together - it equally penalizes lone wolves for obvious reasons.  I will try to find things for the non-Matrix folks to do while the hackers are off hacking, but sometimes it can't be avoided. When the rogues are out scouting and picking locks the fighters are gonna twiddle their thumbs.   -Every Shadowrunner is a glascannon   Feature not bug. Shadowrun is not a game of stand up fights, tanking damage, and beating down the big bad guy. It's a game of achieving the objective without getting noticed (usually) and gtfo'ing before anyone starts shooting.  There are two components of the game's name: Shadow. Run. Consider them.   Balancing:   What is your idea of balance? Is it any character with equivalent karma should be able to go toe-to-toe with any other character? Because if so then that's a false premise and a non-starter.   -reflexboost is too strong   Initiative is important, but positioning and terrain is significantly more important. Engaging your enemies when they're a kilometer+ away from a safe or hidden position will obviate initiative.   -Spirits are way too strong   A mage that can summon strong spirits should be confronted with challenges equivalent to their strength. That is to say, if a team's mage is stomping around with Force 8 spirits then he's going to meet challenges that need Force 8 spirits.  And Ally spirits, if abused, make the worst enemies.   -Spells are too strong   Both spells you mention require an effective line of sight to target. Some tips:  1) Smoke grenades 2) Turn off the lights 3) Be very far away 4) Don't bunch up - always assume the enemy is throwing grenades like it's going out of style"

Pretty much the only guns that are in that DV range are Sniper Rifles (and even then... not all of them).

Shadowrun,3bhu4m,xcbsmith,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:55:28 2015 UTC,"Regarding ""Matrix"" slowing down the game... It's very true that Shadowrun's multi-genre structure effectively creates three different worlds: the one everyone sees, the Astral World, and the Matrix. However, the game is structured so that it is about the convergence of these worlds, which should be reflected in the run. A small team might have only one magician and one decker, but the run itself should involve the coordination of all three worlds. So, you don't just ""sneak past the guards"". You also disable the sensors and and wards. A well structured run should require a very well coordinated team working together, and then everything moves quite smoothly."
Shadowrun,3bhu4m,zarzak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:59:17 2015 UTC,"Reflexes are very important, and the rules for combining reflex boosters are absurdly complex, but it isn't all fun and games. For starters, normal reflex boosts are pointless in the Matrix, so it helps more for meat space.  It isn't as easy either.  A magician can use Improved Reflexes, but to pull off a +4W6, they need at minimum a Force 6 spell, and if they are sustaining it they either have an very absurdly hard to acquire Sustain Focus, a Spirit (which, is now working with a -2, so is much weaker than they once were), or are suffering a -2 sustain penalty.  An Adept can get up to +3/4w6 with Improved Reflexes, at the cost of 3.5 PP, which doesn't leave that much room for other fun things. If you check out Improved Reflexes, it also eliminates most other routes to bump up initiative, including the Adrenaline Boost power (which is arguably the initiative boost power you should be complaining about).  Other styles of characters do generally need to spend money to get comparable boosts, but that is true in general: the magic classes use magic to make themselves more powerful, and the others use things they buy with money. They have some advantages too (Wired Reflexes lvl 3 + Reaction Enhancers lvl 3 makes gives you are crazy +6 bonus to defense tests and +6/4w6 Initiative!). That's not imbalance. That's balance.  I'd point out that drugs are a really handy way to get a short lived initiative boost, there are two qualities that can help you win initiative, and of course Edge lets you get to the front of the line with confidence.  In general though, I do agree that initiative is incredibly powerful and important when it comes to giving you extra attacks. It seems to me though that that extra attack comes with a not insignificant price. To get yourself an extra attack, on average you need a 10 initiative advantage, so that's either a 10 advantage to base initiative, or a +3w6. Of course, if you get hit by electricity or staggered or need to employ active defense, you either need even more or you lose that advantage.  I think a case could be made that Adepts have a bit of an advantage over others when it comes to initiative, but they are supposed to have an advantage in the physical space. That's kind of the point, no? If you think they have too much of an advantage, check out Chrome Flesh. It'll make things seem nicer. ;-)"

A rigger can easily have multiple drones on a permanent basis, whereas a summoner is going to have a hard time managing more than one or two high force spirits.  A level 14 spirit is tough to summon even with buffs & Edge, and then you have a very limited number of services you can get from them unless you bind them (which is even harder). There's a good chance the drain from messing with that summon will mess you up but good.  You compare Ally Spirits, but those things cost Karma and require you to get to Initiate level to start with. They aren't handed out on trees, and non-Summoner characters who invest the same time and energy can make mince meat out of an Ally Spirit."

Remember, you can't heal that stun with a healing spell or a first aid kit. Now I've got a -2 penalty, and if I cast any other high force spells, I'm might actually knock myself out. But, you know, I can attack first, right? Well, not really, because a street samurai with just lvl 1 wired reflexes and a shot of jazz is probably going to get a higher initiative role. Someone with the adrenaline surge quality is going to go first anyway, an adept with 6 levels of adrenaline boost (only 1.5 PP) and a shot of cram is going to consistently beat me to the punch. Oh, and someone who spends an edge... they're going to go first no matter what.  Fireball isn't any stronger than the other elemental indirect attacks (personally I prefer ball lightning ;-). It also is high drain. At F-1 you might take as much damage as your victims if you aren't careful. They at least get to resist with armour + fire protection + body. Even factoring AP, a decently protected tank is going to be rolling more soak dice than you will on the against drain and you are only ahead by 1DV + net hits, they can be healed very quickly, and they haven't used up their attack. All that aside, you have one other problem: it's an AoE attack, which means there are a lot of cases where your party (possibly the caster themselves... who would take drain and the attack damage!!) would get hit by the attack as much as anyone else.  A guy spraying his assault rifle with suppressive fire & extra explosive bullets is going to do almost as much AP, and probably more net hits. They can be far more effective with multiple attacks. Then there is a guy with a high explosive grenade, which costs 100 neuyen, is slightly more powerful than a Force 12 fireball, and since it doesn't impose drain they can keep firing them all day long.  Opium Den certainly changes the nature of a fight, but of course, the mage has to sustain it, so now the mage who cast it is incapacitated, though not as badly as their victims... unless their victims had decent logic + willpower of course (or god forbid, counterspelling or magic resistance)... oh, and of course, the mage has taken that F-1 drain, so is the only one actually closer to being knocked out."

Damage from Mana spells or powers is applied to both (no free rides).   I feel that's important. Also at the end of the day you are limited to  what spirit you can summon without keeling over. For a human with 6 on attributes across the physical board you need to channel a F8 spirit to hit 10 across the board, not too shabby. But for a more ordinary 3 across the board mage, a F14 spirit must be channeled.  I think limiting people to the +4 attribute bonus is probably a solid idea regardless.

That what is happening is channeling is boosting the prowess of the host, but whomever is in control uses their own mental stats and skills.

Shadowrun,3bdv0f,Beaumis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:20:20 2015 UTC,That is definitely one way of looking at it and it makes sense. I cant wait to see what my current GMs viewpoint will be.

Shadowrun,3bdv0f,ElevatedUser,2,Mon Jun 29 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"Possession only boosts physical attributes. You use the lower of mental attributes. A low force spirit will make you weak, a high force one won't help you. In order to benefit from channeling, the force of the spirit needs to be higher than the attribute. To get the full +4, you need a Force 8 spirit. You won't have many services with a Force 8 spirit. According to the missions FAQ, everything obeys the ""max +4 rule"".  Channeling precludes the spirit acting on it's own, which means using it's powers always costs a service.  Invulnerability to Normal Weapons is a feature of Materialization in this edition. Possessing spirits don't have it because they are not materialized. Being dual natured sucks.   Bottomline: Low force spirits don't give you much at all and high force spirits are much more powerful (and less squishy) when acting independently of your actions. The only scenario in which Channeling is really powerful is when a mage that is basically a streetsam summons spirits to boost all his attributes by 4. In that case, it's a very cheap method to achieve that goal. Other than that, giving up the versatily of a spirit for a minor physical boost is pretty lack luster for most mages."
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,rejakor,2,Sun Jun 28 08:31:20 2015 UTC,"""Because two minds inhabit this same body, Mana spells or powers are resisted by the lowest Mental attribute of the two. Damage from Mana spells or powers is applied to both (no free rides)."" This is the only section that ever mentions this, Lower of the mental attributes thing people keep mentioning. Possession says very specifically that you use the spirits Mental and Special attributes. Nothing in the channeling description negates that except in the very specific case I quoted about resisting mana spells.   True enough. But if you have crap physical attributes to start and arent playing Missions then its not hard at all to not only get the bonus, but to eventually go well past +4. Although I would still put the limit at your augmented maximum.   We arent playing missions. We are playing rulebooks only.   Yup. Its very specific in saying that using a spirits powers takes a service. As does giving it control of your body.   Yeah I noticed that as well and thought that was good for the purpose of balance.   Other than being able to be targeted by both physical and astral beings what are the downsides of being Dual Natured?"
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,ElevatedUser,2,Sun Jun 28 09:46:30 2015 UTC,"Possession says very specifically that you use the spirits Mental and Special attributes.   No. Possession says very specifically that the spirit uses its own attributes. When possessing a vessel, the spirit acts, not the vessel. The vessel is merely a puppet. Agency lies entirely with the spirit.   When Channeling, the magician acts, not the spirit. Hence, you use the magician's mental attributes. Relinquishing control and therefore agency to the spirit actually costs a servicve.   Possession is very clear about the fact that there is zero interaction between the spirit and the vessel/magician's minds. That's the territory of inhabitation.    its not hard at all to not only get the bonus, but to eventually go well past +4.    You need a F10 spirit to get +5, if it were/is possible. If you consider that not hard, you won't need the boost. Still valid though. However, Missions FAQ is the closest we'll get to design intent and in many cases, proper Errata, so I wouldn't dismiss rulings like these so easily. It's worth reading.   Other than being able to be targeted by both physical and astral beings what are the downsides of being Dual Natured?   The most obvious answer is wards and barriers. You have to either force or stealth your way through every single magical barrier in the world. If you don't notice one (say, elevator) the astral intersection rules come into play. This will most likely disrupt your spirit. You'll also automatically alarm the creator of a ward unless you stealth through via the masking metamagic. In many corporate buildings, this either means a whole lot of efford or dismissing & resummoning your spirit. Something you don't do on the spot for Force 8 spirits.   However, the biggest danger is actually range. Being dual natured means you are vulnerable to magical ranged attacks from being that don't play by the laws of physics and against which you have zero armor. You are limited to your body, which means astral combat is basically out. You need to maintain line of sight for spells, only mana spells work and your enemies are much faster than you are."

That may be what they mean, since it's in the possession chapter and not primarily written with Channeling in mind, but the way Possession is written, it applies to the magician as wel (it doesn't say the spirit uses it's own attributes, it say ""use the spirit's special and mental attributes""). Channeling refers to possession except where otherwise noted, and it does not note anything about what abilities to use."
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,Beaumis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:58:09 2015 UTC,"Also, for any Physical attributes where the spirit’s Force is higher than the vessel’s Physical attributes, the vessel’s Physical attributes are increased by half the spirit’s Force (rounded down).  While possessed, the spirit’s Mental and Special attributes are used (which means a possessed technomancer cannot access Resonance), with Initiative modified accordingly (use the spirit’s Initiative Dice). The spirit also uses its skills, as it cannot access the knowledge and skills of the host.  Possession does not allow the spirit to operate AR or cybernetic interfaces, and the spirit cannot gain benefits from any augmentations that would require active control.   In context, it pretty much pans out to what Beaumis is saying.  That is fairly strong circumstantial evidence, further compounded by forum posts on the topic by the writers.  It is not definitive under RAW what is occurring, but there's strong circumstantial evidence for one, and that's the way most people will lean because it also makes simple logical sense.  Edit:  To expand on this a bit, the section you are talking about is talking about 'the vessel' and the mechanical effects of the Possession power.  It is not talking about how the magician uses the spirit, or any other context where 'use the spirit's mental stats' would imply you are gaining their benefit, rather than a specific mechanical context to describe the mechanical actions taken by the GM to modify a statblock."
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,Beaumis,2,Mon Jun 29 09:44:42 2015 UTC,"Channeling uses the rules for possession unless noted otherwise in the Channeling rules. Channeling has no rules as what mental or special attributes are used (except for defense against spells and such). It does have rules on how skills work, though.  So, since channeling uses the possession rules, it becomes ""While channeling, the spirit's Mental and Special attributes are used"". It doesn't say the spirit uses that, so it applies to the whole channeled combo deal.  Does that make sense? Not really no. Can you houserule it? Absolutely; we sure do at our table. Should the writers errata this? Yes they probably should. But they haven't.  It's not like it's the first time the writers blatantly contradict the rules (without actually bothering to write a proper errata), after all."
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,Shirck,0,Mon Jun 29 09:55:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree on the first point but thats ok. About the max +4 bonus to any stat, I would say that if that were really an important point they would have put it in the rulebook. Instead they put in a defined starting attribute max and an augmented max. So while I would say if I were the GM that at no time would I let the bonus to physical attributes or the replacement of the vessels mental attributes with the spirits go beyond the vessels augmented maximum, I would not say that at no time is there any way to get more than a +4 bonus to an attribute beyond its current score.    Depending on how often my GM chooses to utilize wards and mana barriers it most certainly could prove to be a problem, but thats a good thing. The downsides are what make upsides interesting. I'm not sure I understand what your talking about with astral combat. Can you clarify that a bit?"
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,Shirck,3,Mon Jun 29 03:06:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand what your talking about with astral combat. Can you clarify that a bit?   Certainly. It's basically the problem that the astral being has more tactical options. For instance, it can attack the DNB (Dual Natured Being) and the vanish through a wall. Or inside a mundane. The astral being can break line of sight very easily, while the DNB has to obey the laws of physics.   You can use astral combat, but you'd use your physical attributes and a smart astral being wouldn't allow you to and simply pelt you spells/ powers and then break LOS. With the speed differences, there's no way you keep up with an astral being unless it wants you to."
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,Shirck,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:41:40 2015 UTC,"So basically your saying that because I would become a dual natured being that i could no longer Astrally Project and so I would not be able to act as a normally astrally projecting person would, moving through walls, using my mental attributes as my physical attributes, moving at astral speed etc. Interesting."
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,rejakor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:39:33 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying that while you are channeling but not projecting you are vulnerable as described above. I'm not sure how you would read that since I never mentioned projection at all.  You do bring up an interesting question though. If you're channeling a spirit and then decide to project, your body essentially  becomes an empty vessel. At this point, two things could happen:   The spirit departs because the metamagic is no longer inside the body. The spirit now possesses the body as per the possession rules.   In the later case, the interesting question would be: Can you return to your body?   Pure speculation as the rules don't cover this at all, but interesting to think about."
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,pseupseudio,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:00:42 2015 UTC,Yeah my thought would be that the spirit would be the one running your body until you came back. Actually thats a pretty fun idea actually. When I need to project to kick some spirit ass the spirit could stay behind in my meat suit. ewww that is giving me the fun time tingles. I love the visual in my mind.
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,insert_topical_pun,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"My instincts tell me the spirit would stay behind, yeah. The issue here is the precedence of Shedim taking over the bodies of projecting magicians and all that entailed. My memory is fuzzy and I don't have the time to look it up, but I do seem to remember getting your body back wasn't easy. Though, you would still control the spirit, so you could just dismiss it I guess.  That would be something worth investigating anyhow, because it could just solve the problem of leaving your body vulnerable while projecting. And when you consider senselink it gets really interesting."
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,pseupseudio,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:33:05 2015 UTC,For my particular situation it wouldn't be an issue. Storyline wise my Mentor spirit from whom I summon spirit aspects of is trustworthy beyond reproach. She is my greatest ally and has been since I was a child. I'm not worried about her jacking my body and then running off with it. For other characters its quite possible it would be an issue though. That gives me a funny thought though. Astral project out of your body and then sense link from the spirit to look at your astral form from the perspective of your own body. No practical applications but fun.
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,insert_topical_pun,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:09:50 2015 UTC,"You are correct that the only time you use your own mental attributes is when you are being targeted by spells and powers with the, ""Type: M"" designation.  Forcing a mage to use their own mental attributes unless they spend a service while channeling is not totally unreasonable, but is definitely house rule territory.  The problem with being dual natured all the time is you will always have issues with mana barriers, spirits will be able to target you from the astral, and you will stick out like a sore thumb to anyone that can astrally perceive.  For that reason you probably want masking before you take channeling."
Shadowrun,3bdv0f,pseupseudio,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:01:44 2015 UTC,Seems like your the only one who agrees with me on the point of mental attributes.

Given that the spirit using 'it's own' mental stats strongly implies that it's not boosting the mind of the possessed individual but rather just thinking using it's own astral brain, maintaining control over yourself also maintaining your regular mental stats is the assumption most people are going to make.  Shirck has, to my knowledge, assumed RAW in many cases where no RAW exists, or at best, is completely unclear.  And does so reliably in favour of his opinion.  In terms of 'what other people will agree with', I don't think you are likely to have many people taking this point of view."

The only concern is that if something does happen with the studio there's no chance of someone else buying the game/studio since Cliffhnager is just licensing the IP from Microsoft so it'd be interesting to see if that does happen if Microsoft does something to try and keep the game alive or just lets it die and release Shadowrun 2: We're Trying this FPS Shit Again."

Shadowrun,3bbg7v,LaplaceAngel,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"My problem with it is that they not only chose the tactical RPG genre, but presented it poorly as well by having everything instanced with one tiny hub. ""Shadowrun"" + ""Online"" shouldn't have been a tactical RPG in my eyes; it should've been like a way more advanced version of Dystopia.  A lot of people in the SR community seem to despise FPS games in general or they probably wouldn't have the opinions that they have. I mean, that shitty 2007 Shadowrun game was clearly not the best they could do if someone so much as glances at Dystopia, but even then, Dystopia's not even close to the game I envision.   It shouldn't be strictly team vs. team, it should be, well.. Shadowrun! You should have to worry about things like slum rent, loan shark debts, implant interest! Lone Star cuffs you? All illegal weaponry, decks, vests gone before you even have the chance to pay your fine for a release! Permanent death when you can't afford that DocWagon. And I'll take it even further: street surgeons should be actual players who have to revive players themselves and not screw up operations (although that one might be a little too wishful in thinking). Maybe even mission givers actually be other players like the old days of Face of Mankind. Could sign onto a megacorp to quell invasions on salary. Yep.. Could take to the streets as a runner, fixer.. The world sure does need more riggers for transportation. In an ideal SR game, to me, everyone should be doing whatever it takes to not be broke gutter trash in the Barrens. Oh, and none of this third-person shit. Stop that!  Naturally, if you trip an alarm or something in the tactical RPG that is Shadowrun Online Chronicles, you don't feel an ounce of that ass-clenching adrenaline that you should! They don't even have the right enemies a lot of the time; no releasing of the hellhounds or nothin'. But even if they did, you damn sure wouldn't be immersed! No heart pounding for you! In my eyes, if something goes wrong on a mission, you and your friends should be having to go like ""Fuck!"" in Mumble or whatever (maybe in-game voice at this point considering CS:GO's new codec) and resort to survival thinking where actual players have just learned of trespassers. Did you not have a passable ID card and they scanned it? Intruder. Ring the alarm. .. Slipped on some Black ICe, did ya? Didn't disarm it in time? Corporate deckers on the way! Should have to jack out and find your way to safety.   Because of this, there simply hasn't been a real Shadowrun game in my eyes. That's just how I feel about it and I'm sure I'll have people disagreeing with me. But, to stay on topic, I'll list a few basic design flaws in Chronicles that annoy me.   Those shitty fake Boston accents annoy me to no end! Haha. I don't remember if there was a way to turn voices off, but I damn sure would've done it if so. Why would game devs settle for poor voice acting at all in an RPG? Either do it right or don't do it at all; there's nothing wrong with reading. There's no building. Shadowrun Returns should be the lesser of the two games in terms of character freedom, but nope! Chronicles has basically no choice whatsoever, except for the two things you equip, and the occasional fork in the skill road. ...The fork doesn't even really change your playstyle.  Why does every player have to have a story that's important? You shouldn't have to be special! You should get the option to be just a mercenary, a fucking gun-for-hire, and not always for a good or decent cause either. Is it too politically incorrect or something to be a part of, I dunno.. Shadowrun?! Where are the assassinations, the unwilling extractions, the betrayals! Bleh. Orks alone breed in litters that reach maturity fast. The massive growth in general birth rate in the Shadowrun universe should dilute the whole hero thing. ... There's still no decking. Still.  They did this whole bait-and-switch thing from their Kickstarter plans. Forum posts suggested the game was going to go free on release and people that paid via Kickstarter would simply be more entitled in some ways, not having to go through the microtransaction process where they could instead spend Nuyen on anything in game. Forum posts also suggested there would be permadeath with DocWagon contracts existing to resuscitate you. ...You were also supposed to be able to put other people on your DocWagon insurance like... a gang. Instead I was given a shit game. Not like any of my friends would invest $30 in it and I can't blame them! I feel like they robbed themselves of a lot of material they would've been allowed to use by keeping the setting in Seattle. If they took the settings and factions from even the very first SR Novel and applied it to their game, it would've automatically been a massive improvement in my opinion.    ..I could probably go on. I imagine I'll get flamed for this, but hey! This is like the one time I'll be getting my opinion on SR out anyway. Flame away."
Shadowrun,3bc536,captainblue49,3,Sat Jun 27 20:33:16 2015 UTC,"LA used to be part of CalFree but they got kicked out because the guy in charge sent a large military force into the slums to hunt down a hacker group who wiped the voting data in response to an inactive goverment which failed to do anything about the Green Tide, the result of a Radioactive Tidal wave caused by the explosion of an offshore nuclear reactor. PCC took it over not long after.  There were recently discovered some tunnels beneath LA which are assumed to be magical in origin and spread as far as San Diego running along the coast.  There is a horrible ghetto called the El Infierno which is separated from the rest of the city by some massive walls. There is no mention of the park that I can find so I'd recommend talking to your GM, he may decide that it's in the more luxurious part of the city and thus might not be the best place to be squatting.  UCLA was the first university in the world where magic could be studied... So it's got some cool historical stuff there...  Horizon has it's HQ in LA.  Running is a bit more ""show business"" than shadows here.

Shadowrun,3bam5q,Emparawr,3,Sat Jun 27 10:59:36 2015 UTC,"The binding part is where it's at. Hermeric summoning, what is now the binding step of summoning, is done in a ritualistic fashion. It is in fact,  a ritual by the definition of the word, but doesn't use the ritual spellcasting stuff. So the ""summon ally ritual"" is still correct in name (even shamans who used to summon on the fly had to do ally summons the long way, usually in a sweat lodge), it just loses something in translation from actual terms to in game rule terms.   TL;DR binding is actually a type of ritual that uses summoning skill"
Shadowrun,3bam5q,Magester,2,Sat Jun 27 14:12:57 2015 UTC,While there are severe editing issues the reason it is listed as a ritual is so that one you unlock invocation or allies you can unlock the other for no initiation and 5 karma.
Shadowrun,3bam5q,dezzmont,2,Sat Jun 27 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"It is probably just written poorly and then not edited.  My reading of it was that you need the Ally Spirit metamagic to create an ally spirit, and then you just use the Ally Spirit section (since the ritual section points to it, and therefore presumably you can ignore the normal ritual rules as regards it) to create your ally spirit.  This is admittedly not the only reading you could come to based on the text.  Ergo, just ask your GM.  And if your GM doesn't want to read through it, just say that the internet has no idea how it works, and that the section labeled 'Ally Spirits' seems fairly self-contained and to work and not to be overpowered, so using that is probably safe."
Shadowrun,3bam5q,rejakor,2,Sat Jun 27 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"Ally spirits are so complicated. All I want is an F1-F2 ally spirit to inhabit my plushy rat toy and come on adventures with me and be cute.  For this I need to initiate twice, perform three Extended Tests and have a chance of the thing coming out the other side dead, or trapped in True Form, and odds are I'll be pretty beat up myself.   ...I think I'm gonna beg my GM to houserule a Karma payoff and have that be that."

Shadowrun,3bam5q,pseupseudio,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:46:02 2015 UTC,"Why initiate twice? The way I had it explained to me here (I want essentially the same thing, just a permanent spirit to be my friend), you just initiate into the Invocation school as your first grade (13 karma) and you do the Familiar ordeal ( minus 10%). If you do it through a school, you get another 10%, so it's a reasonable 11 karma for your first initiate grade, metaplanar travel ability, and learning to conjure a friend. Plus the ordeal itself is you finding the spirit formula, and completing the initiation is summoning the ally.  So the GM may require you save up that karma you'll need to spend for the imitation/formula/summoning, but per street grim it all goes together in the initiation."

Shadowrun,3bam5q,pseupseudio,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:38:10 2015 UTC,I don't know if that would work or not - but you could certainly have an ally spirit which materializes into the form of a toy rat.
Shadowrun,3bam5q,Sebbychou,2,Mon Jun 29 06:51:32 2015 UTC,"Isn't the Summon Ally Spirit ""Ritual"" actually a Metamagic by itself and not a ""spell ritual""?  I kinda assumed it was like most other metamagic where you get it, and now you unlocked a new use for a skill (in this case, binding)  Edit: Nope, it actually are just rituals. That's neat. So Invocation allows both... And prevents Aspected Summoners from doing it since they can't learn Rituals, and an aspected spellcaster can't have Binding or Summoning skills.  Edit 2: To answer your question, it's not really complicated. The ritual just doesn't follow normal ritual procedures. (it actually may do, see edit 3) P.201 explains in detail how to do it. It's just not a normal summoning either (must summon and bind in a row... severely limit the maximum Force here)  Edit 3: Yet more Edit! Actually I just realized that the first sentence ""The ritual for summoning an ally must be made in a Lodge with a Force at least equal to the Ally being summoned"" could mean you need to make a ritual first if there was a comma between ""Lodge"" and ""with"". If it's a typo or bad writing, then it would mean you need to make a Minion Ritual of spirit Force where the net hits simply give no advantage first, and since the ritual is also a Minion ritual, it makes the ally part of the minion limit of Cha...    TL;DR : RAI you have three way of reading it. There is no actual Ritual Spellcasting, just a summoning+binding test that needs a Lodge. (Most likely) You need to make a Ritual of any Force in a Lodge of Force at least equal to the Spirit's Force, then summon, then bind. You need to make a Ritual of Force at least equal to Spirit with no benefit to.more than 1 hit, which automatically mean it also needs a Lodge of equal or higher Force as per Ritual rules, and then you need to immediatly use summoning and binding. (Least likely)   I see your point now."

Dice are just surprisingly difficult to design.   what do you think would have worked better?   Anything that is aligned with the dice axis. When you throw 15+ dice on a table, you don't want a ton of contrasting diagonal lines pointing everywhere, leading your eye everywhere and just being a pain when you or your players are tired, distracted, high or drunk. It's just noise. You need easily recognizable shapes that you can use as a mathematical shorthand. Plus, the lines are so thin I have a hard time seeing them in the photo... and the worst crime of all, not only there is ALSO a numerical value on each face in addition to the pips, they're there TWICE. You have the value THREE TIME PER FACE. And they all face the same direction...  I can't, I don't even... What? This ain't a poker card that needs to be readable by you and people opposite of you, its a bunch of scribble thats gonna get scattered randomly on a table alongside a ton other. Hell, without the numbers it's still hard to read  The dice exemple I gave is built for 40k ork shooting, which can be upward of 70 dice to throw per squad, or 200+ dice in a 15 minute span, and most of the time only 5 and 6 matters, and 6 can sometime give further advantages. As such they're excellent at a glance. 1-2-3-4 faces are all the same vertical pips that are easy to both ignore or count (the mind can process immediatly up to 4 items at a time without pausing to count) and any face that matters are immediatly obvious (crossed pips, and skulls) and you can isolate them in one swift motion. The framing (which also one of the great part of your dragon dice 5-6 designs) gives the thematic ork checkers but it also helps separate each dice in a 2D space (the mass of dice creates one large surface, rather than a bunch of objects on a table, which is good for 40k. It also keeps the pips in manageable groups 1-2-3-4 rather than a sea of loose pips when you need to count) Here you had a great idea of framing only the successes for SRun, where it makes them immediatly stand out from the noise, which is great)  Anyway, anything simple to read, easily distinguishable.    TL;DR : Unaligned claw marks are like arrows, and putting numbers instead of pips on a D6 is rarely a good idea (or ever). Putting then twice is almost trolling.    Exagerated exemple for sake of illustration   Picture throwing 15 dice with little arrows that all point in slightly different angles instead of pips and start counting. Freaking annoying.

Shadowrun,3bdktv,Bamce,3,Sun Jun 28 09:34:25 2015 UTC,That tradition do'  That spirit selection. That is so insanely powerful.
Shadowrun,3bdktv,Sebbychou,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:31:39 2015 UTC,Truthfully I didnt really bother to compare it to any of the premade traditions. GM told me to design my own tradition complete with backstory so I came up with that and gave him about a thousand words to flesh it out. Those 5 spirits fit the story and were more interesting then the elementals. Is there no tradition that has that spirit selection?
Shadowrun,3bdktv,Bamce,2,Sun Jun 28 07:43:35 2015 UTC,"Nope. None. The closest is Vodoo, which has Water instead of beasts and is a possession tradition. It's also the most inflexible flavor of magic in Shadowrun.  I don't think you realize how powerful those spirits are, especially task and guidance. Frankly, with that tradition, I'm not even sure why you would want to have Channeling. It doesn't give you anything except raising your physical stats, which you don't need if you have those spirits around. Channeling is for mages that are already awesome in meat space and want to use spirits as their form of augmentation. Which is lackluster at best in 5th.   A dedicated summoner, especially with that tradition, is a lot more powerful than a Channeler that tries to play meat space hero."
Shadowrun,3bdktv,rejakor,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:08:30 2015 UTC,the possession gives you a bonus to physical attributes equal to 1/2 the spirits force if its force is higher than your attributes and it also replaces your mental and special attributes with its own. That is no small power boost no matter how you cut it though.
Shadowrun,3bdktv,Beaumis,0,Sun Jun 28 09:33:43 2015 UTC,Its almost as if he is intentionally trying to break every aspect of the game.

Shadowrun,3bdktv,Shirck,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"lol. Well that is certainly one opinion. Most of my gaming groups usually enjoy doing something a little homebrewy at character creation. Giving the characters a little something extra special ya know what I mean. I find completely standardized characters to be pretty boring in most rpgs so Ive never complained. This particular gm is definitely taking more liberties both good and bad then most of my gms usually do, but new groups is part of the fun. Anyways I was mostly referencing some absurdly broken theories I have seen concerning channeling. Stuff like snowball summoning into larger and larger spirits. Using channeling as a way to get around essence loss from cyberware lowering your magic by using the spirits magic instead and overly munckiny type stuff."
Shadowrun,3bdktv,Beaumis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:43:50 2015 UTC,"a) What is your goal with this character, beyond 'being powerful'.  a1) This is things like 'theme' and 'purpose on a shadowrun' and 'type of character personalitywise'.  What you have there about 'filling holes' is not a lot of information in this regard.  b) What houserules does your table use.  If all you want is 'generic facemage', dumpshock has about 50 of those, and you'll be more optimized than your party, and so you don't need any help."
Shadowrun,3bdktv,Shirck,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:20:11 2015 UTC,to tell you the truth I'm done with the build now. I have one build for if my GM doesn't like possession or doesn't agree with my thinking on the mental attributes and one for if he does. The story is 99.9% identical either way. The only real difference is how my childhood affliction was treated. Either through a magical/genetic treatment and increased spell knowledge or through a possession merging pact with his mentor spirit. If your interested in reading about it id be happy to post the chummer file and story line. The end for the story line still isn't fleshed out yet and it is a bit long but I think its a pretty interesting character. I'm too lazy right now to try to paraphrase it in any kind of effective way.
Shadowrun,3bdktv,Beaumis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:03:13 2015 UTC,"However what I dont want to do is something cheesy like summon a spirit and have it possess me. Then use that increased magic to summon an even higher force spirit, and wash rinse repeat.   That doesn't work. When a spirit possesses a living person, the spirit cannot access the special attributes and skills of that person. Since there are no spirits with the summoning skill, it can't summon. A Channeler has the skill, but uses the lower of both his and the spirits mental attributes and only his own special attributes. Again, no power creep.   Channeling was gutted in contrast to 4th edition. You might want to reread it really carefully."
Shadowrun,3bdktv,Shirck,3,Sun Jun 28 08:17:18 2015 UTC,"But it does with channeling, does it not? You get to use his attributes and stiill keep your skills. Thats why it is so broken"
Shadowrun,3bdktv,Beaumis,0,Sun Jun 28 09:30:59 2015 UTC,"Channeling makes no mention of the magician gaining any bonus to his mental or special attributes. Possession explicitly excludes the spirit from using the magician's special and mental attributes and makes no mention that the magician make's use of the spirit's.  Possession does say that the spirit uses it's own special and mental attributes when possessing a living vessel. But in that case, the vessel is nothing but a puppet with zero agency. It's the spirit that acts and uses it's own attributes to do so."
Shadowrun,3bdktv,Shirck,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:34:14 2015 UTC,"Through channeling they become a dual natured being with the Mental and Special Attributes of the spirit, the physical attributes of the base creature (plus 1/2 the spirits force if the stats are lower than the force), it uses the base creatures skills (unless you use a service to give the spirit control of your body). When channeling, the spirit is not the one in control unless you use a service to make it so and yes spirits cannot summon for obvious reasons. The using the lower of the two mental attributes is specifically only for resisting Mana Spells. Not for anything else. If you can find text that contradicts any of that I would really appreciate it if you could point it out for me because I want to make sure I have it right, but I think your interpretation is incorrect."
Shadowrun,3b9edy,Emparawr,10,Sat Jun 27 01:30:57 2015 UTC,"The 13 karma gets you a metamagic, and improves some existing metamagic, the 35 karma gets you another point in your primary stat, just like everyone else would have to pay. I don't really see how its that unfair. The only people it really seems like it would suck for is adepts, but only because initiating seems like a much better method to get PP."
Shadowrun,3b9edy,randomaccount178,2,Sat Jun 27 01:48:23 2015 UTC,"Something in 4th I thought was odd is that it was better to do one initiate once and then just buy power points for 15 karma each via the buying extra metamagic rules. I'm not sure if I like it or not, that 5th doesn't have buying extra metamagic."
Shadowrun,3b9edy,Dasmage,2,Sat Jun 27 05:07:35 2015 UTC,"The only people it really seems like it would suck for is adepts, but only because initiating seems like a much better method to get PP   Ya, if their starting magic rating is sufficiently high.  Although if you take into consideration a cyber adept with a magic rating of like 0/1 out of chargen, they can raise magic for 1PP for 5 karma, initiate for another PP for 13 karma, raise magic to 2 for another PP for 10 karma, initiate for another PP for 16 karma, raise magic to 3 for another PP for 15 karma, initiate for another PP for 19 karma...  so its actually fairly even, if you aren't starting with moderately high magic already."
Shadowrun,3b9edy,Shirck,2,Sat Jun 27 01:54:10 2015 UTC,"Indeed, you can do that. I more just meant there isn't really any benefit to having a high magic rating itself on an adept, its all just another means to PP."

Shadowrun,3b9edy,Shirck,6,Tue Jul 14 00:41:06 2015 UTC,"Yes it is quite expensive, but having a higher magic rating lets you do a lot of beneficial things that simply cant be matched really any other way.  Things like determining whether the drain from summoning a spirit of a given force will be physical or stun, how many force worth of active foci you can have without taking an addiction test, or using a meta magic like masking where you add your Magic + Initiate Grade to resist.  If raising your magic was as simple as buying a new initiate grade, you could start at Magic 7 with exceptional attribute, initiate 3 times for <50 karma, and be able to summon Force 10 (or 11 with spirit whisperer) spirits without suffering physical damage.  You'd be throwing 13+ dice (if you grabbed masking) to mask your aura without even using a Power Focus (and you could use a F10 power focus without addiction issues, yes its insanely expensive but 23+ dice to mask is equally ridiculous).  And lots more things that I haven't even brought up.  Raising your magic is extremely powerful.  Compare that to raising a skill from 6 to 9, something that would cost the same karma.  It just wouldn't be balanced."

Shadowrun,3b9edy,zombiebunnie,3,Sat Jun 27 09:15:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's correct. Mages are quite Karma starved, but it does pay off rather well. I mean, you don't really need to raise your Magic by that much. The Initiate Grade matters a bit more. You should only really raise your Magic if your average dicepool is around 20. Getting more than your Magic in hits will turn your Drain into Physical after all. That said, raising your Drain stats will probably matter a bit more at first.  I'd say Initiate 2-3 times then raise your Willpower, which is probably at 5, then start looking at raising your Magic."
Shadowrun,3b9edy,marwynn,3,Sat Jun 27 03:07:59 2015 UTC,"It all makes a great deal of sense. I mean magic does effect a hell of alot of stuff for a magician absolutely. I guess im just getting old and my memories of playing shadowrun about 9 years back didnt seem to match up with what I'm seeing now. I mean obviously that was probably 3rd edition so for all I know it very well could have been different which would explain this weird feeling I had about it. Idk, it just seemed really high for some reason even though it completely makes sense. Eh, I'm just weird. Thanks everyone who posted for the input :)"
Shadowrun,3b9edy,Dasmage,3,Sat Jun 27 04:19:51 2015 UTC,"I seemed to remember that in some past editions the initiation itself rose you magic value as opposed to raising only your max value but admitedly I could be completely wrong on that.    No you're right in that, but magic wasn't the same system hardly at all in 1st 2nd and 3rd vs 3th and 5th.  Your magic started at 6, and didn't change unless your essence when down(cyberware, bioware, or a deadly wound sometimes) or you initiated."
Shadowrun,3b9vka,Emparawr,2,Sat Jun 27 04:21:56 2015 UTC,"You can not craft a Focus with a Force higher than your Magic Rating.  So the limit would be the magic rating of the most powerful artificer you could find.  IIRC, the cap for Magic Ratings is the world's current mana level, which is high enough to support a Magic Attribute of like 25 right now.  So ridiculously powerful beings like Harlequin could in theory craft up to around Force 25 at the world's current mana levels, but aside from that you'd be looking at much lower limits from most artificers.  Finding someone to craft you or sell you a Force 10 focus could be an adventure all on its own."

As the mana levels rise, so will his Magic.  So I guess its possible someone way in the past (thousands of years ago) when the mana levels were higher, could have crafted a Power Focus above F25, but this would be a thousands year old magical artifact."
Shadowrun,3b9vka,Shirck,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't a powerful power focus actually be bad for you?

Shadowrun,3b9vka,helionwulf,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:11:50 2015 UTC,The power foci increases your effective magic attribute so that would increase the amount of hits you could have before the drain would become physical. At least thats my understanding of it. It wouldn't add to the actual dice pool for resisting the drain though so you would be in danger of taking additional drain beyond what you can soak.
Shadowrun,3b9vka,helionwulf,2,Sat Jun 27 21:29:14 2015 UTC,"No, they don't; they're not as cool as they were in 4th Edition. Unless I'm completely mistaken (I don't have my book in front of me), they add their rating to the dice pools affected by your Magic attribute."

Another option is taking Channeling meta magic and channeling a spirit with very high mental (drain) attributes.
Shadowrun,3b9d1z,Shirck,3,Sat Jun 27 01:39:19 2015 UTC,THe centering metamagic and foci from initiation can do it. But that's it.
Shadowrun,3b9d1z,Bamce,3,Sat Jun 27 01:26:21 2015 UTC,Related but not adding dice are Fetishes which reduce the Drain code by 2.
Shadowrun,3b9d1z,Hibiki54,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:00:37 2015 UTC,Using a Fetish also means that you cannot cast that one specific spell without a fetish unless you learn it twice (with and without)

If your security team is fighting an invisible enemy, they should play to their strength:  Volume of fire.  Start suppressing the area with automatic fire (which just requires a cone of fire, as I recall, and not specific targets).  Throw grenades.  Use flamethrowers.  Sweep the area with pew pew lasers.  If your team has been rather egregious in (ab)use of stealth and concealment spells/powers, then utilize the time-honored countermeasure for concealed snipers:  Artillery fire.  If this seems too off-the-wall, which is understandable as not everyone hates shadowrunners, then let your security team have spirits as well.  Give their spirits orders to disrupt or destroy any spirit that crosses your wards.  Have your watchers recording auras and reporting when an aura they don't recognize breaches the perimeter.

Trip the wards, mage orders the fire doors down, they go clang, gas comes in.  I personally love passive traps and incendiaries  because they ruin a team's day.  A squad of weenies with molotovs and a sinking sensation there's an invisible dude because Tommy right next to them just fell down missing his solar plexus and any flesh behind it is going to set the room on fire and run like the dickens.

With a few spirits guarding important things, someone using any magical abilities should be fairly visible and if they try to sustain a spell through a mana barrier/ward, it'll be extremely obvious.  Also, wouldn't it be possible for your blood mage to have astrally perceived the spell-sustaining specialist with the spirit hanging about? And wouldn't the spirit be visible?

I don't think it would be unusual for corporations to hire the services for magical NPSs to permanently set some strong wards beforehand in important locations/everywhere for general protection. What your specialist is doing with the spirit is akin to a quickening spell so this person's post should be useful in describing how wards work and what would happen if your specialist tries to push through a ward with sustained spells."

Shadowrun,3b7btv,marwynn,6,Fri Jun 26 15:36:47 2015 UTC,"Having looked into Alchemy extensively myself, you're missing some of the real pros and cons.  Pros   Alchemy drain is suffered prior to the run. Activating preparations is a simple or free action, and several preparations can be activated at the same time if linked to the same trigger which saves even more actions. Your preparations can cast spells without you being there. Preparations sustain spells themselves, and you do not have to take sustaining penalties for having preparations. Stacking dice is easier in alchemy than sorcery. You can take a specialization in the trigger type for +2 and firebringer for +2 alchemy and +2 manipulation for a total of +6 on manipulation preparations of the chosen trigger.   Cons   There is a significant drop in power from your initial alchemy preparation dice pool and the final dice pool used to cast the spell. You are limited in versatility by the spells you prepared earlier, as opposed to by your spell grimoire. There is a small window in which you can make preparations before your run. Too early and they run out of potency in the middle of the run. Too late and you don't have time to sleep off the drain. You cannot invest preparation time and drain into summoning and binding spirits as this time and drain is spent on alchemy instead.   Alchemy is always looked at as an alternative to spellcasting, but it's actually an alternative to summoning. It's entirely possible to be a competent spellcaster and alchemist, but most people try to make it replace spellcasting because of a limited spell grimoire and the difficulty in focusing on both.  The best way to use alchemy, the only way to use it as a passable alternative to sorcery, is to make alchemy do things sorcery can't.  Arguments such as ""but my dice pool is good enough to cast the alchemical spells"" stop working when you realize that you could just use the same dice pool bonuses to sorcery, or drain resisting tricks on summoning.  Specifically, focusing on using sustained spells, manipulation spells, giving preparations to allies, and buffing spells which you activate all at once are all excellent ways of capitalizing on the advantages of alchemy."

Haven't run the numbers yet, but should allow you to be more consistent in the results without being OP. Reagents set limit of final spellcasting test as well as the alchemy test. Now you can have a decent Healing potion, sacrificing nuyen in reagents instead of running the high risk of cutting potency down to nothing.  Fixation costs some linear amount of reagents based on Fore+Potency of preparation. Because preparations only lasting a few hours and Fixation costing precious karma are both equally ridiculous. Haven't figured out a fair pricepoint yet though. It needs to be cheap enough that if you want to make a couple handfuls of Orgy caltrops you can, but expensive enough that you'd think twice before doing it."
Shadowrun,3b7btv,Sebbychou,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:32:58 2015 UTC,"You misunderstood the ""cannot be dispelled"" part. You can't use spell defense against ""spirits, critter powers and alchemical preparations"" as in you can't use it for preventing summoning, banishing or disjoining alchemical preparations. As per p.305 ""When the spell is released by the preparation, it goes off as though cast by a Magician"". This is one of the difference between Alchemy and Anchored spells (you can use dispell to ""disjoin"" an anchor) The Force of the preparation is extremely important to preparations as it defines its Magic attribute when casting. It gives two dice to the opposed test per point, but is the mechanical equivalent of a net hit on the alchemy test. If you have high magic but low skill, overcasting can be surprisingly efficient. Alchemy sustains spells for Potency minutes. A timed Trigger on a serie of similar alchemical spells can chain a sustained spell efficiently. (Good on stuff like levitate, invisibility, armor, etc.). It can allow to sustain many low-powered spells on a whole team for a short time rather than giving a huge dice pool hit to the mage. LOS is from the preparation, not the alchemist. This mean you can cast LOS spells out of your own LOS if you throw your preparation. This can be useful. Lots of alchemical discussions are in the archive if you want to check more."

(I would assume this would vary from corp to corp.))   In response to your questions:    Which security type do you have the most issue using efficiently or making fun/memorable for the players? Matrix? Astral? Meat?    Probably Astral, in my opinion. Matrix is pretty easy to stylize to fit your decker/rigger while meat can be copped from a lot of movies, games, etc. Astral security still feels the most confusing.    Do you like NPC statblocks?    Hell yes!     I realized that it's difficult to talk about HTR or Special Reaction Teams and other paramilitary organisation without discussing the military organisation and culture for megacorp. Is the military something you would like to have it's own section? Just some info intertwined when needed is fine? Doesn't matter at all to you?

Like, a high threat response guy could be cleared for a F gun and ammo during a sortie, but he's not allowed to own or carry either personally.  One of the solutions I'm thinking about implementing for this is using ""clearance"". Basically, part of the escalation chain defined by the corp style is what is authorized. A sort of simple flowchart for GM to use and players could roll on if they have the accurate KNO skill. (Ex: What triggers "" Authorization to use deadly force"" at EVO is definitively not the same as MCT. At the same time, if the area is super sensitive and fragile, using non-frangible, or even firearms ay all. may be prohibited in some areas barring apocalyptic justifications)  Anyway, you'll see."

Great way for GMs to mess with their players too.  Task Spirits - There aren't any traditions that can summon these and have them materialize. The Vodou tradition can call them and these can possess you, giving you any skill you need. Spirits can't see AR or VR, but if you needed a doctor for long term care, some kind of artisan or forger, this Spirit can do it all. It even has the Binding skill, I don't know if that's a typo.   Important thing to remember: Dismissing a Spirit simply means you're giving up your services. It doesn't make the Spirit go away, though it invariably does want to leave and return to the Astral. Mistreat it and it may stick around."
Shadowrun,3b5y1t,marwynn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:35:11 2015 UTC,Is there a way for other traditions to summon it but not have it materialize then?  OR did you just mean its a possession tradition only?

Shadowrun,3b1rd1,Allarionn,9,Thu Jun 25 07:15:22 2015 UTC,"Nicely written. One thing I'd adjust though is the infiltration note - I'd argue that Matrix adds a third category of infiltration which is just as important as social or stealth, if not more so, depending on the job. Being able to get your hands on layouts, camera locations, guard schedules, access codes, or anything else you can dig out of your target's net before you physically go in are assets you really want to have.  Also, might want to consider discussing avoiding overkill. Leaving a bunch of shocked and stunned guards behind instead of a pile of corpses can really lessen the heat from a job. A simple B&E probably won't even get the area cops involved, whereas murdering half a dozen security guards and any staff can put a big target on your back in multiple jurisdictions."

Shadowrun,3b1rd1,gimlettio,3,Thu Jun 25 18:11:14 2015 UTC,I think this guide (and my GMing) would really benefit from a section for the GM. I've always felt that Black Trenchcoat Shadowrun is so much more complicated than any other RPG I've GM'd so some more advice on how to GM games like that would be great.
Shadowrun,3b1rd1,Musclewizard,5,Thu Jun 25 11:38:17 2015 UTC,For overall story it's pretty much the same.  For the individual runs.  The best advice I can give is just make a working building/group. Don't worry about what your runners can do.  Make what the building would have.  Runners are like water they will find a way to flow.    An example would be say they need to steal some physical objects and a matrix one.  It's all contained in a subsidiary of a AA corp.  It's going to have maybe 5 guards with an offsite mage and spider. Find some office layouts online that fit the building idea and plan some routes that cover the exits for the guards.   Make a room the guard station. Set some basic criteria for what the guards do under certain circumstances.  Then let the players at it.
Shadowrun,3b1rd1,ozurr,3,Thu Jun 25 13:02:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's more or less what I've been doing but I'm still unhappy with it. One of the things that gives me trouble is HTR, even the fastest HTR in the book feels like it's way different from what /u/Sebbychou wrote in his guide. Especially if you're considering how fast combat goes even 1d6 minutes can be a really long time. I'm really having a hard time slowing down the runners enough (or at least threatening them with something that could slow them down).   Another things that I'm unsure about is what happens after the run from the corps side of things. The consequences of cameras left unhacked or other evidence left on the site. All these things that could come back to bite the runners in the ass. I feel like those elements are important simply to make decisions (such as using disposable guns / comlinks / vehicles) actually significant."
Shadowrun,3b1rd1,CitizenJoseph,4,Thu Jun 25 13:12:11 2015 UTC,"You're right about the HTR response times but that's in line with realistic crime.  Most robberies that are successful are in and out before the cops even get there.  If the runners plan well enough then they should never meet an HRT.    The evidence on the other hand is where they would start having problems.   Keep notes on all the evidence they leave behind.  Physical, Matrix, Astral forensics exist in the world and corps have their own depts as well as the rent-a-cops.  So each time they leave something behind keep track, cross reference, and start building cases trying to figure out who they are using just the evidence, heck you can use detectives as well; start sending people to question contacts and friends. As soon as you have enough to identify them send an HRT to their last known address."
Shadowrun,3b1rd1,Sebbychou,3,Thu Jun 25 14:14:25 2015 UTC,"I think that is part of the point.  The clock for HTR starts when combat starts.  You're obviously going to win the fight you started, the problem is that now you have a deadline."
Shadowrun,3b1rd1,Sebbychou,3,Thu Jun 25 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly - and as GM make sure you keep updating the clock for non-combat movement and actions.  And remember to look at the movement rate of the slowest runner - sure an agile sammy can run up 2+ flights of stairs per Combat Turn (a floor is at least 3 meters, could be double or triple or even more for a atrium-area 1st floor or factory area), but keep your eye on the one who took AGI as a dump stat, and can only move maybe 4 (run 8) meters/CT.   (If somebody took AGI 1 now is the time you can cackle with glee :D)  If they take an elevator, everybody is limited to the elevator speed + a bit of friction time waiting for the doors to open/close and exiting one at a time.  Hope the hacker had it there ready and waiting with the doors open, or it's additional time to stand around waiting for it to come from a random floor.  Hope it's not a 50 story building! Once in a while you can be a bastard and have a freight elevator full of boxes or pallets so possibly all the runners can't fit at once without taking at least a little time to move some stuff...  If the target room is on the top executive floor, the offices might not even be labelled, even in AR - anybody there knows who's who, anybody coming up will be escorted by a secretary.   Hope they got a map (not just blueprints) in advance..."
Shadowrun,3b1rd1,Musclewizard,2,Thu Jun 25 17:20:43 2015 UTC,At least in my games I've never seen a fight last longer than a couple of rounds. Given how short a round is I don't really see it working as a ticking clock.
Shadowrun,3b1rd1,boobonk,5,Thu Jun 25 13:39:19 2015 UTC,"It's a mission clock and a good indicator when you want to go loud, and when you absolutely don't.  If your team draws down when you're a half hour from completing your objective, you're in trouble.  HTR is going to near guarantee that you've just failed the job and brought a lot of heat on your future travails.    If your team opens fire after the objective is attained (or you're within 1d6 minutes of attaining it and exfiltrating), then you have incentive to get out that much faster."
Shadowrun,3b1rd1,KatNine,5,Thu Jun 25 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"The fight isn't the clock. The fight STARTS the clock. As soon as a guard's biomonitor goes black, a call goes out to HRT.  You now have only a few minutes to accomplish your mission goals and get out before HRT shows up.  Before the fight, you could take your time.  Edit: it actually pays to be ""weak"" because the guards won't call in backup if they think they can handle it themselves."

Shadowrun,3b1rd1,DustToAsh,4,Thu Jun 25 17:07:14 2015 UTC,"Hi, regarding response time and combat...   Response time for HTR vary greatly depending on zone. 1D6 minute is a standard for an industrial area IIRC, but there are some really intense response times. An Ares max security zone had a response time of 1D6 seconds in a 3rd book... Which is essentially what happens in the 5th ed rulebook intro story (the one the cover illustrates). That stuff is insane. It's basically the Firewatch patrolling VTOL dive bombing its passenger through the room's window. With that said, 1D6 minutes is still hella short if you did not already accomplish your primary objectives. Extracting a prototype or unwilling employee with such a short timer is a scary prospect. For the length of a firefight, remember that the goons are there to stall, not die for the cause. If the threat is serious enough for HTR, have the firedoors close except for corridors leading to easily defendable choke area or traps, the lights turn off and the security personnel flash powerful blinding spotlights (Blinding Glare modifier is -6) at them, using smoke and blast the heating to either body temp to mess up thermal vision or just to extreme temperatures if its a security measure (oven heat/freezing A/C), if there's a security mage, stuff like poltergeist and icy floors adds on the penalities as well, keep the corpsec in full cover doing suppressive fire with Frangible or Stun rounds, use the R&G Tactics to further boost the security advantage, etc. Stack the penalities and try to use various means and force Fatigue damage to whittle the runners Stun Track. Once the alarm is up, the runners are in a uphill battle against time. Once the HTR comes in and they're still in this penality hellhole they're in for trouble. Beside, one minute is just 20 turns. If you have a lock in the way that is an extended per-minute skill test this also up the pressure (that's at least one minute right there), etc. Use your GM tools. (X) [1 minute] extended tests are worth repeating in their own bullet point. Lastly, HTR will still chase you until they reach a jurisdiction that will prevent them from it... Or ... You know, accept the fine/cover up and barge through if the insult was strong or if they think they can get away with it... Or... You know... If you just left a mass carnage scene, you cannpretty sure all the laws around can work together for this case. That's gonna be one hella chase scene. Make clear from the get-go how long their escape will take before they're out of the Extraterritorial zone (and if they're against ARES, that includes most of Seattle... So good luck) Make the player sweat bullets, and you know... If they fucked up too early, they should consider falling back and trying again another time. Failing is part of life, learn and do better next time.    Post-battle forensics   I do perception/assensing/matrix perception tests using a Contact rating adequate to the situation (3 to 9 connection rating usually). I add bonus/penality depending on the situation and/or player actively covering their tracks. I use the hits to define what they learn if anything. If its enough to track the player, I start looking closely at what the player do, and if they do stuff that can lead to them, i keep track of it and eventually I throw a wrench at some plot-appropriate time.  That's assuming they did something worth the trouble."

Shadowrun,3b3tpg,Boojum2k,3,Thu Jun 25 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"Potential twists:   Daughter is actually an operative of EVO, perhaps even another runner. Her team, or another team, was meant to extract her. She doesn't want to go willingly yet. Maybe she has fallen for the richboy. She could be running away for real after betraying her team. Or she needs the richboy's biometrics for something to hack and get more paydata. Of course the richboy doesn't actually love her. It's a full-fledged rescue now, the team actually has to fish her out of the water as she's thrown overboard. They now have to recover the data she took and make the handsome dastard pay. The richboy isn't actually from MCT, not a corpkid but perhaps on their payroll. They're just another bunch of runners. It'd be funnier if you incorporate the first one too, where everyone's a double agent. The real purpose of the trip is to cover the extraction of someone else.   Additional details:   Head yak guard has ties to the Seattle yaks. Good or bad ties, you decide. He could have a price on his head or be the main antagonist in the follow-up. Make him a PhysAd with Qi Focus tattoos! What happens if your players decide to sink the ship? Are there lifeboats for the crew?  When (not if) things go south, what does the backup look like? Is there an MCT ship quietly escorting them? Maybe some Spirits and/or drones could come flying in."
Shadowrun,3b3tpg,marwynn,2,Fri Jun 26 12:55:55 2015 UTC,"I like several of those! Thinking of setting the girl at least up as a runner, probably a well-equipped decker (family money), which explains how she got the data she stole from her father. I'll probably leave the two lovebirds motivations relatively clean (hey, even in the Sixth World it can happen), but there could be some complications from their guards as you say.   When (not if) things go south, what does the backup look like? Is there an MCT ship quietly escorting them? Maybe some Spirits and/or drones could come flying in.   As it stands now, the ship has its own host both for entertainment and security. Twelve armed and armored rotodrones (F-8 Bumblebees) fly a pattern above the ship to give a real-time view of the ocean around, as the host's virtual environment is a dirigible flying over the real ship's course. In the event of a major emergency, they can be called in by backup. And the guard force I've detailed already is basically the night shift, additional backup will be waking up and gearing up in the event of an alarm, much like in a AAA neighborhood, 1d6 minutes response time. The drone spider is now designed as a Prime Runner, as is the security spider, both of whom are asleep but will also wake in response to alarms. The host is operating the lightly armed maidbots and flyspys at al other times, and has Patrol IC active, and will spawn Black IC first in response to any detected intrusion. It's not a zero-zone, but MCT doesn't believe there's such a thing as overkill.  The ship itself is close to 170 meters long, it would not be easy to blow up or sink with anything the runners can carry or even mount. It's also armed (never know when some monstrosity is going to rise from the depths, or some pirates are going to be feeling their Wheaties and try to take on a megacorp ship), although not too heavily, a handful of LMG mounts and a pair of anti-vehicle missile launchers. It's magical defenses are lighter, but each wagemage (6 total if all shifts are woken up) is going to have a number of bound spirits they can use, along with the possibility of watchers and maybe a homonculi. In addition, once the security spider is up and online, he, and agent programs, will be targeting Matrix attacks against all detected devices, possibly including the fast boat. Much of those details will be available to the PC's with any basic research before heading out (they have up to 48 hours, it takes the cruise ship 9 days to cross the Pacific, and the Vory craft is a good bit faster) so they will be mostly aware of potential consequences of going loud."

It is simply to removal of fear and anxiety without the introduction of something else.   For example, anyone that's done acid or psychedelic mushrooms knows that you don't take it and just hallucinate. Your judgement is dramatically altered and your thought processes are smashed apart and made into something new.   I'm not sure simply likening to kamikaze fits!"
Shadowrun,3b2cb1,Feynt,4,Thu Jun 25 12:47:47 2015 UTC,"Kamikaze actually does fit the case I feel.  Though along with the general sense of invincibility you also have heightened aggression and a general berserker quality heaped on until it wears off, so it's probably not what you want exactly.  If you mean ""I have no fear"" in the literal sense, like it's been edited out somehow through psychological or drug conditioning but no other emotional qualities have been altered as a result, the person would likely be ridiculously reckless and impulsive.  Fear is a guideline to your limitations.  ""Maybe I shouldn't run into that room of 5 guys with shotguns, armed with only an Ares Predator V and a flashbang.""  vs.  ""It's only 5 guys with shotguns versus me with an Ares Predator V and a flashbang.  I'm sure I can take'em out before they recover.""  The fearful person would realise even with the flashbang, odds aren't stellar.  The fearless person wouldn't even consider the odds and instead is guided by other emotions like pride, hatred, and excitement to try because there's no sense of self preservation there.  Fear is also part of your inhibitions, social anxiety about whether it's alright to go out in public in a neon green and orange outfit for instance.  In short, they'd be comfortable doing a lot of things normal people would baulk at.  Strutting the barrens naked?  No problem, I've got my HVAR and a smile.  Skydiving out of an 80th floor office building window with guards in hot pursuit?  People have survived worse, I'll be fine.  Pissed off pack of ghouls who heard my remarks about their questionable eating habits?  Well it's true, and I'll take'em on anyway to prove it."

On the ground, they'll need to move silently to rescue a captured soldier. Tension is high. So as they're given a signal to prepare to jump, each soldier adjusts a dial that controls their nervous system, triggering a sudden drop in adrenaline. In a moment, their anxiety, their fear, is gone. And then they leap.   The points you bring up are interesting. How much affect would a lack of fear have on your judgement? You'd still understand what ideas were bad and unhealthy for you, you just wouldn't be scared of doing them if you decided they were necessary options.   For example, I'm not scared of swimming in an ocean and I understand sharks attacks are extremely rare. That said, I wouldn't swim through an area where sharks had been sighted because I would be too scared. Remove that fear, and I still don't think I would do it because I'd still understand having a limb bitten off would have disastrous results. If I decided it was worth the risk, I would not be scared of the murky shapes swimming below me and would be able to concentrate on the task at hand.  That's how logical thought-out decisions could be approached, in my opinion. Now, snap-decisions made in milliseconds?

Shadowrun,3b2cb1,Feynt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:37:51 2015 UTC,"it depends, I'd say, on what you mean by fear.  If you mean the emotional and physical response that happens when you're terrified, then it's likely as you say, someone could have that removed and still behave in a rational manner.  At it's core though, fear is basically our ability to predict consequences.  When you think about shark infested waters and get a sinking feeling or whatever, it's because your mind is theorizing about the consequences of getting bitten by sharks.  So perhaps you could liken it to disease vs symptoms.  In the way that most (all?) cold medicines don't actually fight the cold at all, they just lessen the symptoms until your body can fight it off on it's own.  Similarly if the fear-removal method takes away just the ""symptoms"" of fear (basically the adrenaline response I guess) but leaves the actual basis of fear (the ability to recognize consequences to dangerous actions) then a person should be able to make perfectly logical decisions, like you're saying, though fear would probably still be a factor.  In general it's hard to nail down emotions so specifically."

You don't step out into moving traffic, you wait for cars to pass.  If you think you've got good odds at flipping through traffic to pursue someone who happens to be getting away, you'll be more likely to try it.  I'd force anyone except a fearless individual to do a composure check before hand, and failing that means a 4 die penalty as their self preservation kicks in.  Sure you may normally roll 15 or 16 dice, but if you need 6 to flip through traffic unharmed because I set the threshold that high (it's rush hour) and you can't maintain your composure, you're not flipping through traffic (or at least, statistically you won't) without getting plastered by a car."

But somewhere there's a voice, however quiet, that is telling you to spit in their face and fight back.    Fear is a deeply engrained reaction for humans, and really for much of successful life.  We wouldn't have survived to this point without a healthy amount of fear.  But being freed of it, all the natural aggression that is also necessary to get beyond simple survival comes to the surface in its place.  If such a person had a counter balance to keep them alive, they might be an incredible driving force for those around them.

Shadowrun,3b2cb1,Sniper061,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:55:01 2015 UTC,"Short Answer:  I'd give them the ""Guts"" Positive Quality.  Long Answer: 5e Shadowrun doesn't really implement fear in combat or the fog of war.  Your character is already being controlled by a fearless, cold, calculating mind - yours.  So I'd be very hesitant to grant any significant persistent bonuses for fearlessness.  There are some particular circumstances where a complete lack of fear might change the rules - for instance, when you're in a zone of suppressive fire, the rules state that ""Anyone in the suppressive fire zone or immediately adjacent to it takes a dice pool penalty to all actions equal to the shooter's hits, unless they are completely unaware of it"".  The fact that they are only penalized if they are aware of the danger heavily implies that it's caused by fear, rather than any actual impairment of their abilities.  So I'd grant a truly  fearless character the ability to ignore this penalty as though they were unaware.  You'd also be immune to (or have significant bonuses to resist) the effects of the Fear power, Intimidation, and the like.  A lack of fear doesn't necessarily mean a kamikaze attitude - desiring not to be injured for logical and practical reasons could be just as strong as the fear of death.  In some cases fear is an advantage, too.  Fear drives the fight or flight response that allows grandmas to lift cars off babies, etc.  So I might not allow a fearless character to take positive qualities like High Pain Tolerance, because their body simply doesn't pump itself full of adrenaline and endorphins in response to stress like a normal person's would."
Shadowrun,3b2cb1,Sebbychou,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the other GM's here.  I think that a character would probably be willing to take some more risks but would not be a kamikaze.  Simply being fearless does not rob a person of their ability to parse out a situation and react accordingly.  Instead, I think it would do the exact opposite.  Instead of being a kamikaze, the person is much more likely to take a very reasoned approach to combat and various other situations.  They will base their actions on whatever course of action will best guarantee the success of the mission by their own standards.  They will utilize cover and concealment, prioritize targets, and act more efficiently than others.  What this means is that for most normal situations, they will actually play a more cautious character.  For example, a completely fearless character will feel no need to run out into the open simply to kill somebody when they know that they will likely get shot in return (and likely result in a detriment to the mission).  Instead, they will either wait for the enemy to do something stupid or try to force the enemy to do something stupid.  They would do this not out of being afraid but by the opposite.  The combat doesn't phase them in the slightest and they realize the best chance of success is to exploit their enemies blunders.  However, if and when the time comes where completion of the mission hinges on putting themselves in mortal danger, they simply won't fret over the decision.  They will act.  Even if it means taking a bullet or even getting killed.  TL;DR, a completely fearless player is one who will do whatever the mission requires to be completed.  BUT at the same time, they will not take unnecessary risks simply because they are fearless."

Shadowrun,3b2cb1,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"I'll add my 2 cents to a thoroughly discussed topic. A lack of fear would mess with your ability to make solid decisions in combat as your risk evaluation would be slightly off. For this very reason the military would have a group command calling the shots and telling people when to activate their regulators and doing so remotely for them. There is a grenade in the bunker, it's too far away to reliably pick up and throw out. Command activates the regulator and commands Private O'Brian to jump on the grenade, whilst simultaneously giving the command to the rest of the group to get out of dodge.   I'd see this as something that the military uses in combination with biomonitors to overcome those moments in the field when your muscles freeze as you go through a building and come face to face with some scared kid with a gun. It'd allow them to push through self preservation for the greater good or for tactical advantage. It wouldn't be running all combat long as being fearless isn't a true replacement for courage."

Shadowrun,3ayi7t,sebwiers,7,Wed Jun 24 15:44:00 2015 UTC,"Not really. There's tons of ways to control what kinda drain you get, notably reagents and force. Edging just makes it dangerous :P"
Shadowrun,3ayi7t,VoroSR,0,Wed Jun 24 16:18:32 2015 UTC,I don't think it worked this way in 4th edition. I'm not sure if OP is doing it wrong or if it changed in 5th edition. It used to be that overcasting made the drain physical damage no matter what.
Shadowrun,3ayi7t,HaxDBHeader,9,Wed Jun 24 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"Nope, I'm not doing it wrong.  RAW: ""Step 6"" of the magic overview on page 282 of the 2nd printing (which is what I'm using)  "" Remember that if the number of hits you rolled when casting the spell (Step4) exceeds your Magic rating, then the Drain causes Physical instead of Stun damage. ""  So yes, you can overchan and still only suffer stun drain values, as long as you don't roll successes OVER your magic rating. So a higher magic rating makes it easier to overchannel and still only take stun. Also remember, that even if you knock yourself out with stun, it's 2 stun = 1 physical when you over flow from stun into physical."
Shadowrun,3ayi7t,HeckfyEx,3,Wed Jun 24 17:23:57 2015 UTC,wow. Turns out I've been playing not only overchanneling but also damage overflow wrong.

Shadowrun,3ayi7t,felicidefangfan,2,Wed Jun 24 17:25:25 2015 UTC,Welcome
Shadowrun,3ayi7t,StarManta,3,Wed Jun 24 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"That is certainly what I remember from editions I played.  It seems very odd that you could get the main benefit of the overcasting (high base damage) without the drawback (physical drain), and more so that you'd be less likely to face the physical drain if you rolled a smaller pool, but still get the benefit of it being a high force spell.  Seems like somebody with a pool smaller than their magic rating could overcast ALL THE TIME, with no risk of physical drain?"
Shadowrun,3ayi7t,Kromgar,3,Wed Jun 24 17:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree it's kind of a weird design choice. On the other hand, having a smaller dice pool means you're less likely to hit for indirect combat spells, and you're still only going to do damage equal to your net hits regardless of the force for direct spells."
Shadowrun,3ayi7t,Starsickle,2,Wed Jun 24 17:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for direct spells it totally makes sense.  My issue is with ones where the force alone (regardless of extra successes) can accomplish a lot.  Every edition has had its share of those, but it was always physical drain to cast over magic.  5e seems to do a better job of basic spell effect on the casting test results more than spell force, and this seems a very weird exception."
Shadowrun,3ayi7t,thewrongreasons,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:49:18 2015 UTC,"... or you could spend reagents and limit your hits to your magic, and reliably hit your max."
Shadowrun,3ayi7t,RoboCopsGoneMad,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:37:37 2015 UTC,This is the subtle oddity of indirect spells. The force creates a real physical effect that you then aim with your casting roll. I suspect your GM givegoofeds because the big bad should have had active defense available. Remember: a lightening bolt can be dodged.

Perhaps a lieutenant in the boss's organisation wants to hunt the player down for revenge? Maybe a news outlet got hold of the footage and now there's a man hunt for the ""lightning god murderer""?

One of my favorites was a game of 2E where I played a twilight historian with a houseruled case of Past Lives and Amnesia who was a master of White Reaper Style looking for the reincarnation of his Lunar mate. He used his magitech experience to create a scythe that he could conceal under a large cloak (The explanation was that we hid some of it in Elsewhere, and used the remaining portion of the handle as an anchor to allow for quickdraw with less Essence expenditure).  Optimal? No. Entirely in line with the flavor? No. Not a single whit of sorcery on my Twilight.

The party was doing a favor for an Ares contact, backing up a team that he had lost communication with. They get to the ongoing fight and see three toxic shamans with summoned spirits. My buddy's mage overchannels massively, spending the edge on the casting test instead, and overchanneling WAY more than he could handle. It wound up flaying the flesh from most of his arm as he released the spell, but he took out one of the shamans (the leader, no less) and a couple spirits with the fireball before he passed out. Its still one of my favorite in game moments ever."
Shadowrun,3b08pv,jasrags,3,Wed Jun 24 22:43:52 2015 UTC,"Personally I like your idea of a secondary gm and 2 tasks; I feel that having your whole group together for the meet and legwork then dividing into the subteams (at which point the secondary gm starts his part of the game and the players go into separate rooms), before meeting up again (in the same room) for payment would definitely help the flow.  My own experience with large groups comes from a simplified version of paranoia (my shadowrun group is only 5 fortunately, unlike the 10 or 11 I have for paranoia) so here's a few tips that might help:   Keeping focus becomes key as people end up having their own conversations and distracting other people. Often (especially during combat) you'd get to person 5 and they'd be like ""whats happening sorry?"" as you interrupt their conversation about the babe they definitely pulled at the club last week. You might enforce a ""everyone focuses on the game for the x hours we're here"" or try and offer an incentive for paying attention (perhaps use something like paranoia's perversity points: every time someone does something funny/helpful/cool they gain points (which you provide in the form of snacks or a prize for whoever gets the most)) Use a map or blueprint to keep track of where everyone is, even if the players can't see it. Trying to keep track of everything in your head isn't possible Keep your descriptive details brief - a couple of interesting details about the person or place. Most will be added by the player actions (and you'll pretend it was there all along). Talk about the fat, sickly pale elf, or the expansive and bustling market place where the stench of people mixes with wafts of aromatic spices and foods. You want to minimize the time any player isn't doing something. Plan out a few concepts for what the run will involve, but don't over complicate them. Take a map of the run area, a few npcs and what they might be up to, a few skill checks to overcome obstacles, and a couple of potential complications. If need be just improvise on the spot.     For example: take a floorplan with a few security devices, have a statblock for ""guards"", ""wageslaves"", ""security spider"" and work out what they'll probably be doing (rough patrol route, where wageslaves will congregate, how the spider/host responds to a potential security breach), have a couple of checks in mind that should come up at any point in the run that you think is right (perhaps a gymnastics check to get over a fence/desk, agility check on the freshly polished floors, sneaking check to avoid the guards), and have a couple of complications in mind to maybe use if you've got time (the electrician comes round for the monthly server maintenance while the players are stealing it, an astral patrol notices the mage's shady activity and sounds the alarm, the rigger was parked illegally and has to fend off a traffic warden moments after the run begins etc)    Change opposed tests to threshold ones (ie take the averages hits you'd expect each npc to make and make it the new threshold). All combat damage to enemy mooks is lethal (or lethal in 2 hits if you absolutely must extend combat), only track the damage track for a super-mook (like an enemy mage or cybered up ork) or the big bad/named npcs (if you have any). Even then have a combined track to speed that up and don't do any rolling for them. Make sure you have a challenge in mind for each player, there shouldn't be a reason for the 6th player to start up a conversation because his street sam wasn't getting used during the stealth mission. Everyone has a turn before time advances, go around the circle and have everyone talk about what they want to do, wait for anyone who holds up the game (they'll get berated by everyone) If you have lines you want an npc to say have a player do it! Give points/whatever in exchange for a person reading lines off a post it note, or acting out what you say to them (For example the party meets mr Johnson, you give a brief description (heavily tattoed, in his 50s). A player (either preselected or decided now) either reads out a welcome message (from the note) or acts out what you tell them. If you say ""the Johnson welcomes the party but skips any formalities to begin the briefing"" the player would be expected to come up with the line (like ""good evening, lets keep this short as we don't have long"")"

Shadowrun,3b08pv,Valanthos,3,Thu Jun 25 00:18:59 2015 UTC,"When I deal with larger groups I institute a few sanity rules. Any situation from meeting the Johnson to combat everyone only has so much time to say their piece before it moves onto the next person. People can elect to say nothing by nodding the next person on. This helps keep people involved as their part is never too far away.   I also have a white board that I stick up initiative on so people have a solid idea of what is going on in combat. I get my players to adjust their scores after their action to keep me a little more free.  Recently I have taken up giving more tasks threshold numbers instead of opposed tests to cut down on the rolling a little.   If a scene is taking too long players can vote for the scene to come to a close and if the majority of players vote to do so we go into the final five. This means those involved in the scene and I work to finish the scene within five minutes. This voting is done with a black poker chip.  Edge is kept count of with green poker chips, stun track with blue,  physical with red. This allows me and the players to quickly assess the team.  I have a box to throw the dice into this helps the dice stay on the table when people roll fast and furious. Furthermore I try to give different players different coloured dice so several rolls can happen quickly and we can still tell who is who."

Shadowrun,3azupc,Sebbychou,2,Thu Jun 25 02:09:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I do agree that the lifting/carrying rule is kinda wonky. I'm used to lifting rules to be like 10x the carrying capacity. So I was honestly surprised that it the numbers were this low. (I saw a strong man competition where they had to pull a jetliner. Granted one of the guy tore his spine when the plane wheel hit a cameraman wire... But still). I'd say a Positive Quality (Human Forklift) that gives a multiplier and/or your gymanstic skill rating your STR to lifting could work.   Out of curiosity though, let's see what a theorical high point a 5th world human could lift....   Exceptional Human, STR7, BOD6 Edge7, all hits [its a world record after all], each roll are 50/50 sixes and fives   (7*15) 105kg base  ((7+6+7)*15) +300kg, 10 sixes  (10*15) +150kg, 5 sixes  (5*15) +75kg, 2 sixes  (2*15) +30kg, 1 six  (1*15) +15kg  675kg... Oh boi... We could easily go to Gymanstic Rating + 2x multiplier on lifting and we'd still be realistic...   Potential homebrew solution   I'd say I'd allow to add +1kg to the basic lifting number in exchange for 1 point of physical drain (if number above BOD it becomes physical), available to non-adepts? Ex: drain10 exhertion = 25kg per STR +25kg per hit?"
Shadowrun,3azupc,Valanthos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:35:27 2015 UTC,That'd be a great idea. The drain could be resisted with BOD+WIL.
Shadowrun,3azupc,gimlettio,2,Thu Jun 25 23:19:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly (well, according to RAW anyway).  From the encumbrance section (p 420):  Lifting and carrying more calls for a Strength + Body Test. Each hit increases the weight you can carry by another 10 kilograms  From p152: Lifting/Carying (BOD + STR) The baseline for lifting weight is 15 kilograms per point of Strength. Anything more than that requires a Strength + Body Test. Each hit increases the max weight lifted by 15 kilograms. Lifting weight above your head, as with a clean & jerk, is more difficult. The baseline for lifting weight above the head is 5 kilograms per point Strength. Each hit on the Lifting Test increases the maximum weight you can lift by 5 kilograms. Carrying weight is significantly different than lifting weight. Characters can carry Strength x 10 kilograms in gear without effort. Additional weight requires a Lifting Test. Each hit increases the maximum by 10 kilograms. For more details on carrying gear, see Carrying Gear, p. 420"
Shadowrun,3azupc,Valanthos,3,Thu Jun 25 02:03:32 2015 UTC,That's lifting long term as opposed to short term burst of energy.  It's not like that guy in the gym who lifts 190kg for a fraction of a second you can carry a huge amount of weight all day without concern. Imagine being able to carry two adult men on your back all day long without it causing you any strain... Furthermore a lot of troll strength is used on moving itself around.
Shadowrun,3azupc,Valanthos,2,Wed Jun 24 21:31:08 2015 UTC,"So how would you go about figuring out how much that troll would be able to lift in that ""fraction of a second""?"
Shadowrun,3azupc,Valanthos,5,Thu Jun 25 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"Going by the rulebook, little changes except a few numbers and it ends up at something like 240kg on average. But let's say the Troll is able to get all hits it could lift a potential of 420kg (925lbs) of course even this is for a three second lift...  Also... despite what you think a normal troll wouldn't be able to rip a car in half, unless it got some amazing rolls and was an incredibly skilful martial artist.   Alright I'm willing to accept you are correct and maybe the lifting rules need some reconsideration...  The worlds strongest man has lifted 2,840kg via a backlift. Maybe if lifting was changed from a STR*15kg to a (STR)2 * 15kgs we might get something closer to proper lifting for a momentary lift. The sickly bed man would still only be lifting 15kg. Average Joe could lift, 135kg for a fraction of a second under this new regime, and human strong men could lift 540+kg. Or in the case of a truly exceptional individual (Strength of 7), edging it and squaring hits on the extra weigh test, 3,270kg. And your Troll would be able to lift, 1500kg normally with a potential maximum (if you apply the squaring rule to the hits on the extra weight too) of 6360kg."
Shadowrun,3azupc,dethstrobe,2,Thu Jun 25 01:38:32 2015 UTC,"See, that's eases my mind.  The 6360kg top end for a troll is a bit crazy to me, but somehow more reasonable than 190kg haha  Thanks!"
Shadowrun,3azupc,Valanthos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:54:56 2015 UTC,Useful for those moments when someone is crushed by a section of a building and the Troll of the team holds the roof up for a small burst of time for the rest of the group to get out before he dies amongst the rubble... Or so we think ...BURN EDGE! He shall cometh back as the Cybertroll!
Shadowrun,3azupc,vvelox,2,Thu Jun 25 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"The lift test doesn't accurately represent metahuman weight training. There is a difference between someone deadlifting 1K lbs and a troll lifting a 1k lbs experimental prototype rail gun. The barbel is designed to be picked up, the rail gun is designed to be a stationary firing platform, but the 10 str troll isn't going to care either way and will be able to lift both.  Lets say we got a troll needing to break a plascrete brick wall. structure 10, armor 16. The brick can't dodge. Troll gets 3 hits and is using hardline gloves on the brick and deals 14p. The brick gets 8 hits on its soak, does 6p and since that's less than the structure rating...the wall is fine... hm... I thought that was going to go really differently.  Lets try this again, maxed out augmented troll punches the plascrete wall, gets 5 hits with 14 STR and titanium bone lacing for a +3 and does 22p. Wall gets 8 hits and takes 14p, which is over structure rating, so the troll just punched a 1 meter hole in the wall.  Hm...punching holes in walls is actually a lot harder than I was expecting it to be."
Shadowrun,3azupc,Hibiki54,2,Thu Jun 25 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"That's because you are using plascrete walls, if you are in an apartment complex the walls won't be plascrete unless they are load bearing so the bulk of walls will be much easier to punch through."
Shadowrun,3azknh,jarydmidas,9,Wed Jun 24 19:42:59 2015 UTC,"Second part first: Easiest answer: a sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip is still shotgun sized. If he wants to use his pistol holster, he needs a pistol. (A 12-guage shotgun shell has a diameter of 18 mm, twice that of a 9 mm pistol bullet, and about half-again the size of a .45; and that's just the bullet. That said, there are IRL handguns that can shoot .410 shotgun shells - all the recoil and spread, but none of the punch, range, or capacity. IIRC, there once was a manufacturer that made a snub-nose revolver that fired rounds meant to take down an elephant. Because I'm sure people regularly get caught flatfooted by enraged elephants in close quarters. Fucking elephants.)  First part second: Personally, if a player were whinging that much about an accessory to me, I'd just let them have it. And then let him discover that Ares [or whomever] installed RFIDs in 'em because nobody with a concealable quickdraw could possibly be up to any good. He thinks his gun is hidden and then KE stops him for a ""random"" frisk - and they know exactly where it is. Or he's running on a warehouse and suddenly every guard in the place knows his exact position - because the RFID is pinging on their AR.  Then again, I'm a bastard."
Shadowrun,3azknh,NatanGold,3,Wed Jun 24 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"I like your style! We've voted against sawed-off shotguns being in any pistol holster.

Shadowrun,3azknh,Sebbychou,3,Wed Jul 1 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"I agree on the shotgun premise. Sawn-off still has too long of a stock/barrel to be considered a pistol. A -1 to concealability with a reduction to effective range would be a fair trade IMO, though."
Shadowrun,3azknh,Zemalac,6,Thu Jun 25 16:06:06 2015 UTC,"By RAW, the concealable holster has -2 when wireless, the concealable quick draw doesn't have the wireless bonus. It's already different. I remember reading somewhere about sawing off a shotgun reducing the range to that one of one of the pistol types, -1 or -2 accuracy (and I think DV) but giving a bonus to concealement by one level. I genuinely don't remember where I saw that though."

Non-wireless, isolated networks will still need some sort of hardwire interface, like 'trodes or a datajack, but a technomancer can plug directly to the system without a cyberdeck and still use their living persona (plus, getting a datajack is a good idea for a 'mancer trying to hide their abilities from the public)."

Yes, it does.   Core p.222: but DNI is also useful for AR in that you don’t need any additional gear like earbuds or an image link to see or hear augmented reality objects.    TM gets all this benefits through his Living Persona.   what other benefits are there?   Mix or blessings and curses :)   They could perform resonance based actions and they do not need deck to hack (saves a lot of money). They are supposed to be Matrix Mages, but the support is lacking: no equivalent for ingredients, focus or rituals. If you only have core, you could not use direct connection, echo for that was published later in Data Trails. Data Trails were supposed to give TM some much needed boost, but instead we were told that it will be provided by yet another upcoming book that will target specifically TM. TM are by their very nature very karma starved, you have to increase more attributes than decker while you still have to increase the same hacking skills as decker does plus your unique resonance based skills. Also to upgrade yourself you have to buy Echoes while decker just buys new gear. Because of this, decker will have slight pool edge on the TM (if they could afford the gear). You will have a lot of spare money, because you won't have to waste it on deck. TM could offset this advantage by using Sprites, but some people detest to be sprite summoners. You could perform the same actions as a decker and some that decker simply is not capable of. (Like use puppeteer on spider to shutdown the host.) You could transcend grids, that means you could hack hosts that are on local grids across the world without any penalty. You could be much faster than decker in achieving some goals. For example you can puppeteer guard's gun to eject munition in one complex action (through puppeteer). Decker needs to get marks on the gun first (so at least one more complex action). You do not increase OS if you stick to resonance based actions. Also most of your resonance actions are invisible to non-resonance critters (like spiders, hosts or ICs). TMs  will benefit from a prolonged run, where they slowly worm their way inside the host while they could sleep of the drain."

And as soon as i can afford a disguise kit even more. As i said, i imagined him more of infiltrating social situations like hitman. Not really talking to anybody, but scouting the situation, plaming stuff und gathering info from files in backrooms, rather than talking.  Also, strategically placed in a crowd to support the face.   Edit: I know social interaction is his weak spot, but i like weaknesses of a character. However, i wanted to have be able to do something if the scene is at a party, so I figured posing as a security guard besides the dance floor could be quite fun. Does not have to talk much, probably nobody giving him too much attention. Does this work rules wise?"
Shadowrun,3axce7,Angel-Forest,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:52:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, that works. But with low etiquette you still attract unnecessary attention.  On other things, do you really need two weapon skills? Automatics already have wide amount of different types of weapons, but if you want sniper rifles for maximum power, you probably need pistols for more conceal options.  Banishing and counterspelling doesn't work good. You can easily kill weak spirit without banishing, but strong one just kill you with drain. With your perception/accensing you can detect enemy mage before you will ever need to defend anyone with counterspelling.  So, I suggest to swap Attributes and Skills and rise your damped stats a bit.  Unless you want to dodge everything, you don't really need reaction that high. Your initiative is still too low to reliably get 4th IP, but way too high for three.  As for spells. Physical Barrier is universal solution for many problems. Take Stealth or Silence, because your sneaking isn't very high and disguise doesn't help with noise. Can't see any reason to rise Intuition even higher unless you really want that 4th initiative pass, and I'm not sure if you can handle drain in such case. Or you want spirit of man to cast buffs on you?  Ah, and why put trodes in mask?"
Shadowrun,3axce7,Angel-Forest,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:51:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the low etiquette worries me a little.  I probably do not need two weapon skills, i just thought that having the option to sniper would be hella cool and fit the concept. But maybe i shoudl switch it out for more etiquette and stuff...hmm...would be sad to see it go though :(  The Banishing is only there because most skillgroups have one skill i do not desire and banishing seemed the best honestly to have some uses at least sometimes (ritual magic and alchemy....ughhh) And i did not have enough skill points to get Binding and summong to 6 otherwise.   Hmm, maybe, although i love all the Skills and feel a little stretched thin even with 1.  Well dodging is supposed to be a strong theme for the character, I actually think one of the strong points of the mage is that i can use his high WIllpower for fulldefense and such. Is there any way to reliably get myself in the range for the 4th Ip? Or should i try to find a way to utilize Interrupts actions, since i should usually be able the get the 26...  I actually read Physical Barrier and i do not quite understand what everyone likes about? I mean it is ridicioulisly easy to just shot through it. I mean on average I cast with 12 dice, thats 4 succeses. 4 Armor, 4 Body is pretty much paper. And when someone shots through it, they only ever lose 1 DV right? And for making bridges and stuff i can just levitate,cant I?  I considered stealth, but i thought an average of 11 Dice on sneaking would not be too bad? (with attribute boost agi on) Althought i do want Urban Sneaking ASAP, another thing which i could not do because of the skill groups.   With increase Intuition I also really was not sure, but using a spirit of man or getting the binding Initiating, was exactly what i thought about. I mean, I also first take the effect than resist drain with the higher resist right? I just thought Intuition would be really good if i got it via spirit or binding, so i would be much better at dodging yet again, doing the detective work, resisting magic and it statistically gives me the 31 ini. I considered AGI, but i thought the adept power actually would be good enough for this. Do you know of any other good infiltrating spells? Do i maybe need more detection, or maybe i should get some illusions for red hering?  I did not really have the patience to really understand all this equibment stuff. Some guide said put trodes in your heatgear so you can actualy use the wireless stuff or something, so i just did."
Shadowrun,3axce7,Angel-Forest,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:29:31 2015 UTC,"Is there any way to reliably get myself in the range for the 4th Ip   Take metatype with either Int or Rea 7 to have base Initiative at 12, than reflexes +4 to Rea and 12-14 on average dice -> 28-30. If mysad, can additionally boost Int. Another way is be a mage with bunch of sustaining foci and increase Int, Rea and Ini simultaneously.   Physical Barrier   It is not shield. It is way to manipulate things you can't levitate, water or sand for example. Or throw grenade at pack of enemies and block their way out with barrier - they just have no time to break through it.   11 Dice on sneaking would not be too bad   For infiltrator? Too low. It's good for sammy, who just don't want to make noise before he is ready to shoot, but dedicated ninja can easily do more.   I mean, I also first take the effect than resist drain with the higher resist right?   Not sure about it. If yes, you probably be okay.  Dunno about more spells, maybe physical mask.  You can just wear trodes on your head, there is no reason to put them in headgear. Also, you don't need AR gloves if you use trodes."

Well the sneaking is bugging me now....not sure what to do about it, when i get Urban sneaking and have 13, plus the invis and stuff, is it then in a better ballpark?  I thought about maybe switching out the attribute boost to body for the adept power version of physical mask, what do you think?  Ah okay, ty, so i will probably get rid of the ar gloves then, and put the trodes in my head :)"

If you don't like 4th, you'll HATE 5th.  If you DO like 4th, understand that 5th adds some decent rules changes, and then proceeds to brutally desecrate the entire concept of ""editing"".  There are actually sentences in the books that are so poorly edited they are unreadable.    as a quick example, this lovely line "" When’s he facility is not in use,"" from Battle of Manhattan p 25.    I, personally, really like 5th edition, though it necessitates all KINDS of discussion to settle on rules interpretations due to the editing.  But if things like the above get on your nerves?

But there haven't really been any efforts to make things clearer beyond that.  Part of the problem is chasing around rules (a reference will lead you to a page that points you to a different page), part is ambiguous wording, part is things that just never get addressed, part is simple organization, and part is straight up line editing and proofreading issues.  a fan re-edit would be a tremendous amount of work I fear.  However, if you look around in this sub you'll find a lot of people have put together little things to help.  I myself have a crude cheat sheet I've put together (though just last night I discovered it needs a little editing itself, it's missing ""Control Device"" in the matrix section).  If you can stomach the searching, one of the things 5th ed does remarkably well is give you lots of room to play with the system how you need.  I've rarely found a system I found this easy to house rule.  so if someone in your group is willing to do the legwork you could probably put together the system that's right for you."

Why would you toss rules in for a ritual for a ""group bond ritual"" in the middle of every ritual a single person could, and then add on top a random header switch(so it looks like a new totally different topic is being started) and 2 full pages of tables and fluff in the middle of a paragraph.

Shadowrun,3au9sn,jWrex,2,Wed Jun 24 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"Combat's different... now everybody gets a pass before subtracting 10.  There aren't any rules regarding upgrading rigger stuff yet, so that's a major frustration.  (Even a variety of rides would be great.)  The Matrix is now wireless... and everywhere.  The decker doesn't have to stay somewhere safe or run naked, which helps integrate the party together again.  This comes back and bites the rigger in the butt, though...  Everybody's got wireless gear.  It usually gets slaved to their commlink (better firewall, simpler to access for everybody), and those tend to get slaved to the decker's gear.  If the decker's cyberdeck gets ""bricked"" (Matrix damage maxed), everybody's back on their own again.  Because everything is wireless, it's possible to take the rigger's gear from him/her (unless jacked in directly via cable).    Note: I haven't read Data Trails yet, things might change.  5th brought the rules back in line with 2nd... mostly.  The skill web is gone, target numbers are a thing of the past.  Now, what counts is net hits.  You still need 6 sided dice, you still have handfuls of them.  Now, a 5 or 6 counts as a hit, a 1 is just a 1 (unless more than half of the dice you are rolling come up 1, then it's a glitch, or a critical glitch if you don't have a single hit).  Edge gets you rerolls instead of Karma, and there are no more pools.  (On the plus side, you can use a point of Edge before rolling to add your Edge 'pool' in to your dice roll, and get the benefit of ""exploding sixes"": the hit counts, you reroll the die.  If it comes up a 5, it's another hit; if it comes up a 6 it's another hit and you get to reroll it again.)  Give the Quick Start rules a read through, maybe a play test.  You might like it.

The critter form spell ignores that. If you want to turn into a small cat or a rat that has a body rating of 1, while you have a body rating of 4, you'll need to use the right critter from spell. You'd could also turn into a whale with a body rating of 20, while only having a body of 5 if you know critter form whale(which would be really over powered for a cyber pirate game)."

You can be a rigger in the back that jumps into drones to control them and do everything for you. Here you can have smaller spy drones, larger combat drones or more combat drones (combat drones are fun but expensive if they go pop often).  You can also focus on driving if you would prefer, a badass rigger driver can be the difference between catching that escaping target.   Blending a rigger with other char ideas is always an option. Rigger/Decker allows you to hack your targets and then jump in (if they allow it) to surprise your opponents. Rigger/Sams are a blast, running a drone army through AR while you blast your way through waves of gangers would be a fantastic experience. (Not sure if you actually need a Control Rig to do this one)  I will offer you my personal opinion/warning with riggers however. Be prepared to go scouring through the core rulebook for rigger related rules and mechanics. They seem to be spread out throughout the book in small chunks....

Shadowrun,3atxj2,LordKilgar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:55:40 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, with shadowrun being completely lost doesn't stop after character creation...  as a number of people here have suggested, Hero Lab is a fantastic product for making a somewhat intense character creation process manageable.  The three basics to keep in mind as a rigger are pretty much this,  1.) Everything you have is vulnerable to hacking, make sure you can defend (a good RCC does a decent job of slowing down a hacker, but putting a bullet in said hacker does a better job)  2.) you will be managing your character, and any pseudo characters you attach to your character (vehicles, drones, more drones, lots and lots of drones).  If you are a drone rigger you are kinda going to be coplaying a bunch of character-lites with your GM (you give order to drone, drone figures out how to do that).  Rigging can be a nightmare of too many things to keep track of in an already complex game.  For your GMs sake I suggest you look at SR5 p 270 so you at least know your rolls, and then get used to the fact that you may end up with 7 different initiative marks. (unless your GM is so insane they roll for all your drones themselves...)  3.) machines are pretty dumb, but they are great at parallel processing things.  with an RCC you can have small armies of identical drones do things in concert.  This is pretty much the peak of rigger power since you can unload on someone with essentially 16 synchronized machine guns.  BUT, in order to do that you are going to be paying LOTS of money.  Money should be priority A, in pretty much every case.  as for write up I suggest this.  Decide concept  1.) do you control a lot of drones, or are you a driver extraordinaire a la The Transporter  2.)  A.) if you are a driver, what do you drive? planes? trains? automobiles? helicopters? boats? all of the above? jaegers?  B.) if you are a Drone Rigger, are you versatile? (a number of drones for a number of purposes) or focused? (strictly combat rigging, or strictly surveillance, or the like)  3.) what is your MO given your answers to 1 and 2?  After that it's a matter of making the system work for you.  pick money Priority A, buy the best optimized package you can for your concept, make sure you have the skills to use it (for drones, I highly suggest reading SR5 p 270 to get an idea of what skills you'll use), make sure the attributes backing up your skills are there (for instance, a combat rigger with steel lynx is shooting himself in the foot with a logic of 2 considering you're going to be using Logic with the Gunnery skill to hit anything).  Then it's pretty much personal preference.    If you outline your answers to the questions above we can probably offer more specific suggestions.  In the mean time take a gander at Hero Lab."
Shadowrun,3atxj2,LordKilgar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:18:42 2015 UTC,1) I like the idea of having my own fleet so drones  2) As they say variety is the spice of life   3) as for this I don't really know. I suppose I'll mostly be in a support role either mapping out places with my little spies or bringing firepower to the front
Shadowrun,3atxj2,Boojum2k,2,Tue Jun 23 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Alright, Drone rigger means you'll have a lot of bits to keep track of.  Check out SR5 p 466  So, fly spies are indispensable.  Even if you were just going to be a straight up driver I'd recommend one.  If you want to be a swiss army knife or recon, get a bunch.  It sucks leaving a drone behind, but sometimes there isn't a good option for getting it back, not hesitating at that moment can save your hide.  with a few flyspies you can be a roving security system.  keep track of enemy movement, get intel, push the feed into a recording program and get some nice blackmail material.  Flying Eyes can act as distractions, spies, and even stun grenades.  Then there is something of the core of your arsenal, the MCT-Nissan Roto-Drone.  This puppy is pretty much a flying assault rifle (bear in mind you have to buy weapons to put on it as well). I suggest 3-6 of these, you'll more than be able to lend a hand when the drek hits the fan.  Finally, consider the Steel Lynx.  Pretty much the only drone that can take a hit and not immediately die.  You'll want pilot groundcraft 6, pilot aircraft 6, electronic warfare 4+, perception 4+, sneaking 3+, and spend the rest of your points as you like.  You want an RCC (SR5 p 267) (I recommend the Proteus Poseidon if you can), a control rig (SR5 p 452) (rating 2 since you can't get rating 3 at character creation).  You'll want a good logic, a great reaction, and spread your other attributes around as befits your character.  You might consider some further cyberware (SR5 p 451 on for like 10 pages) like something to boost your reaction and logic further.  then just focus your money on outfitting all of your drones with appropriate weapons, and trying to get some better programs to put on your RCC and share out to your drones.  I probably don't have time to do the build justice, but I'll see if I can crunch some numbers tonight and give more solid suggestions.  DEFINITELY check out at least SR5 p 270.  Once you wrangle the drones a few times you'll get it a lot better.  SR is a system that really needs to be played to be understood.  Good Luck!"

Shadowrun,3arylc,reynoldswillendyou,8,Tue Jun 23 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"Force - Essentially instead of having a level one healing spells called, cure minor wounds and a level five healing spell called heal moderate wounds you have the same healing spell and you cast a spell at a higher force to get it to do more. However casting this spell at the higher force will cause your shaman to have to resist more drain. Drain shouldn't be trivialised as I've seen it kill mages who didn't take it seriously.  I'll use the Heal spell as an example (though really if you are casting this, things have already gone wrong).     Heal [Type: M, Range: T, Duration: Permanent, Heals boxes of Physical Damage equal to hits on Spellcasting Test, Drain F – 4]  So what does this all mean? You can see most of it listed on pg. 14 onwards of the quick start rules but I'll expand.  Type: M - Mana, Mana spells more or less only affect living things. No healing your car with this spell.  Range: T - Touch, you have to be touching your target to start the spell.  Duration: Permanent, they aren't going to suddenly have a bunch of holes reappear in them after some set amount of time.  Note: It's not present in the Quick Start rules, but the mage would have to sustain this spell (take a -2 penalty to all rolls) for a number of turns equal to the amount of physical boxes  he is healing in normal Shadowrun. This has been dropped for easy play in Food Fight.  Heals boxes of Physical Damage equal to hits on Spellcasting Test. What does this mean it means when the Shaman casts the spell he rolls his spellcasting dicepool of 9. Every 5 or 6 he gets from those dice rolled will heal one physical box. Where does Force come into this? Your total hits are limited by your Force, if you rolled 9 successes and had a force of 1, you'd only heal one box, so it's worth considering how much you want your spell to do.  Drain: F-4, this means the drain you have to resist when you cast this spell is equal to the Force at which you cast it take 4. Now the minimum drain you have to resist after casting a spell is two, this means there is no reason to cast this spell at any force less than 6... Unless your magic was under 6. Why? Because if you cast at a force higher than your magic, any drain that you don't resist does physical instead of stun damage. You can if you wish cast a spell at a force twice as high as your magical attribute.   Note: Drain can't be healed by anything apart from bed rest"
Shadowrun,3arylc,Valanthos,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:15:47 2015 UTC,"That's no longer how it is determined if drain is physical, what is called over casting. Now the drain is physical I the number of hits you keep is higher than your magic. So casting a high force spell might be safe if you don't do particularly well on it. Casting a spell with a force at the same level or less than your Magic attribute now just guarantees that any drain will be stun."
Shadowrun,3arylc,Phiscas,2,Tue Jun 23 13:31:16 2015 UTC,"There's a few paradigms that have to be shifted to get into the headspace of Shadowrun.    The biggest is the mechanic.  Instead of adding a number to a die that you roll and trying to roll over a target number, you're going to be rolling a pool of dice and counting successes.  As your pool gets bigger you are statistically more likely to get more successes.   Some rolls are going to be really bad and you roll 1's and 2's and 4's and hardly any 5's and 6's.  Some rolls are going to be well above average and you roll mostly 5+.    Your pool is built by adding your stat to your skill ranks to get a number.   Now, no matter how well you roll there are limits on how successful you can be.  If you're a very oblivious dwarf your perception is going to be capped by your mental limit.  Let's say you get lucky and roll six successes, if your mental limit is three you don't get to count success over three.  So your super good roll only counts as three.  You have a physical limit, social limit, and mental limit that are calculated based on your stats, but there are other limits too.  One is the accuracy of a weapon.  No matter how well you shoot there is an inherent accuracy of a weapon.    Another limit is Force.  When you cast a spell you get to pick how powerful the spell is going to be.  You get to pick what the limit of your spell is going to be.  The higher the force/limit the more dice you're going to get to keep if you roll successes.  For the most a high force doesn't mean a more powerful spell, just that the spell could potentially be more powerful if you roll well enough.   So you're going to cast heal.  You cast it at a Force 2 and that means the most hits you're going to be able to count is 2.  You cast it at force 7 and the most you're going to be able to count is 7.     So why not just cast your spells with as high a force as possible all the time?   When you cast a spell you take damage based on the spells force.  Heal is Force - 4.  This damage has a minimum of 2.  So if you cast a Force 2 you take two damage.  If you cast a Force 6 spell you take two damage.  If you cast a Force 10 spell you take 6 damage.  This damage is called 'Drain' and you're going to be able to resist this damage by rolling a 'Drain Resistance Test'  So a higher Force spell is going to potentially be more potent but is also going to cause you to suffer a higher Drain.   Now as for Hacking.  This is a bit more complicated.  The short hand version is that in order to access digital information you're going to need access to it.  To get access to a network you have to put marks on something in the network.  Marks are little signs that show you have access to something  If I want to get into your computer I would first have to get access to your Network.  How would I do that? There's plenty of ways, but the primary is to find a weak point.  Let's say your computer is on your network and so are your goggles.  If I could break into your goggles, I could break into your network, I could then break into your computer.    I do so by placing marks on things that exist digitally.  If I mark something digitally I also mark the master controller that thing is connected to.  If I mark you Laptop I also mark your Router.  With enough marks I can convince your Laptop and your Router that I'm a perfectly innocent and reasonable guy and should be allowed to run around your network."
Shadowrun,3arylc,lowkeyoh,2,Tue Jun 23 05:56:06 2015 UTC,"The thing about Shadowrun is... well, D&D is one game.  There are wizards and clerics and fighters and such, but they're all on the same board, so to speak.  (Or, if you use a battlemat, literally.)  Shadowrun is really three games.  There's the physical world, the magical, and the matrix.  It's pretty rare for a character to be able to do anything in all three of these arenas, but most characters will be able to contribute in two.  (Although, it's not uncommon for a character to specialize in one.)    It can be tough to layer these three game elements in a way that keeps the whole group entertained.  Astral scouting will leave the mundanes bored, hacking will leave the non-hackers twiddling their thumbs.  It helps to switch back and forth between these scenes when possible, but this also requires the players to not go off on wild flights of fancy into the sub-games."

I recommend streamlining the matrix rules a bit, once you understand how they work, or just making stuff easier to hack in general (kick 4-6 dice out of enemy resistance pools, lower Host ratings, etc), as otherwise a non-super-optimized hacker is going to struggle hard.  EDIT:  The book is in general formatted fairly badly, and assumes you have a working knowledge of 4e to begin with.  I had serious difficulty finding the applicable rules for things.  Don't go into it with the expectation of a modern sourcebook, it is confused and some rules or information that should exist in it, simply doesn't.  The rest is largely hidden, or written in a confused, unedited manner."

Shadowrun,3asfd8,Boojum2k,2,Tue Jun 23 05:35:29 2015 UTC,"To permanently heal one, I guess. A heal spell has to be sustained for several turns before it takes permanently, or hits have to be spent to reduce that time."

Or that there's some sort of threshold to beat. It is more difficult for low Essence characters but that is it.   You're immediately healed by the amount of hits on the test, but it'll take Force combat turns -1 per hit, to make that healing permanent. Also, First Aid. You'll have to spend a Complex Action each Combat Turn per box of damage being healed. It's not instantaneous like the Heal spell, but they stack."

Shadowrun,3asxub,marwynn,3,Wed Jun 24 04:33:19 2015 UTC,"Nothing.  Unless they personally have any sort of goals, which all metahuman beings do, in which case they will do stuff based on those goals.  Using the group, and being used by the group, in pursuit of those goals.  Really the answer for this is to go visit a friend who works at a university.  People come together to work on research projects (and use postgrads) when there's too much work to do alone (and time limitations to get it all done), but a lot of the effort is individual, especially in setting up those group whatevers.  The reason it's a good example is because it's not a streamlined office environment.  Most modern offices/businesses have a 'factory line' approach, where tasks and roles are as specified as possible to increase efficiency.  The only real freedom of action comes in higher-management positions, or by skilled individuals manipulating the system to some degree to be able to try something new out.  John Q Magician can join an organization and just use it to buy spells.  But some people will join and want, y'know, a big shared lab with little living spaces attached to it so they can summon spirits there.  Jim likes bikes, so when people decide they want their Laboratory Fortress to have vehicles, he has to either hire a guy to handle vehicles, handle vehicles himself, or magic up a solution, etc.  Maybe he gets interested and starts finding ways to bind spirits into vehicles.  Maybe he hires a muggle mechanic using money the group is making selling healing potions.  Etc.  The point of any group is to have skills and manpower on hand that you don't personally have, as well as to have greater bargaining power when dealing with other groups.  If you're thinking of it as 'if you put 6 adeptgicians in a room and tell them 'do magic', under RAW, what happens?', and the answer is 'nothing', or 'they go do a group ritual spell and get a homunculus'.  In reality, it's more like 'people live together with a shared goal, even one as nebulous as 'not get black bagged' or 'make money', and do individual stuff based on their skills and goals while being able to call on the group (or be called upon) in extremity'.  As well as having much better facilities, since they are shared.  Better Lodges, more spirits, reagents, formulae, teachers, magical muscle, physical security, nicer cars, etc.  Even if they don't have a fortress o' doom, getting stuff via favours from another Mason is much cheaper and easier than buying it retail."

Others are like Cabals and follow some hidden agenda while again others are basically fraternities/sororities (in the traditional and modern sense).   In the end, it comes down to what you want out of it. Membership in a magical group can be the equivalent of owning a library card or a life long commitment to a cause.

Shadowrun,3arec9,setoking,5,Mon Jun 22 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"GM Tips -    Don't get overly hung up on the mechanics.  The story is the most important part.  Gloss over or reduce the rolling if necessary to keep the story moving.  Don't ignore mechanics to make the outcome you want happen, only to keep the story moving or make a really awful outcome (for the story) turn into an amazing one (PC doesn't just 'fall into the pit and die', PC catches onto scrap metal and hangs there as Darth Vader tells them that he is their father). Don't railroad.  Any NPC you put into the world can die if you get out-thought.  Just make another.  Don't force people to take jobs.  Involve them in the job in another way (hired by another faction, someone they know is kidnapped, they hear about something and try to steal it and it turns out it's connected to the job but they didn't know etc), design a new job, ask your players why they would be involved - but avoid exercising authorial control over your player's intents.  Make them roll to successfully do stuff, but don't try to tell them what they try to do. The matrix rules require a lot of rolling and you should condense that.  A lot.  Making up your own thresholds and opposed checks of about 1/3rd the roll density and using those is probably superior to using the rules as they stand. Spirits and mages are really powerful if you don't have Watcher spirits as often as cameras, and astrally-projecting mages to defend facilities that report a magical attack.  The book says to do so.  It's a good idea.  Don't shut down mages entirely - but make them have to work past the same level of defense as the physical has, especially if they try to brute-force the problem. Ask your group what they like, try to focus your efforts in those areas, although keep in mind what they report as liking may not be the source of their enjoyment (i.e. they may be incorrect about why specifically they are having fun). You don't need to have every detail of a run written down.  Instead, try creating a list of ideas like 'gurkha bodyguard' and 'super-fast elven disco' and 'checkpoints surrounding the facility with spike strips' and so on, and use those when appropriate.  Also can have a list of little flavour items like 'green mohawk', 'graffiti', 'street light cameras clicking away', 'throat-singers' etc you can sprinkle into descriptions to liven them up.   Mix things up.  Through down a floor plan and then have the group break in only to find out the facility is a shell and the real [object] is on a hovering platform above the pacific ocean.  Throw down a floor plan and have it be incorrect.  Have the Johnson lie to the PCs about why they are there (easiest thing is make a simple objective - kidnap girl for political leverage, steal research to make breakthrough, etc, and then camouflage it - extract brainwashed girl, steal research to use as proof to expose them, etc).  Remember shadowrun isn't our future - it's the 1980's cyberpunk future.  Hackers use headcables and green text on black backgrounds.  Chrome is a thing.  Crazy slang and people living 'off the grid', etc.  Portray that. Have gritty sleazy people as well as just corporate johnsons.  Portray the difference. Create NPCs that are vulnerable as well as have defining traits - verbs, nouns, adjectives (running, garden, fat - a fat man who likes running and gardens or gardening) can all be traits, vulnerability is having traits that make the PCs care about them or who have recently lost a bunch of stuff, as well as NPCs who are tough and cool, or perhaps disconnected and disinterested.  Add contacts to your player's sheets with wild abandon.  Tie them tightly to the world. Give players cool stuff, but don't be afraid to take it away.  Safehouses getting blown when the heat gets too high, possessions being temporary but skills and connections being permanent is a setting feature. Have an overarching plotline, but tie it seamlessly into individual sections.  Don't sacrifice short-term story flow for long term denouement - it's never, ever worth it.  Make whatever you are running right now somehow work in your overarching story and later climax and endgame. Have a climax and endgame.  Every story has to end, with either failure or success.  This doesn't have to be 'soon', and you can have another story with the same characters (although with some sort of differentiating mark, like '3 years later') afterward, but it has to come to a climax, and it has to end."

Shadowrun,3arec9,Valanthos,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"Well having a firm grasp of mechanics is always solid.  My advice on how to run it... Set up some pieces and let the players knock them over or put some new ones up as they will. Don't bother looking too far in advance, simply because that way you don't get attached to a certain outcome or plot hook. If your players jump on something that seems fun to explore make that what things are about.  Every run should break down into;   The Meet: Exposition, tell people what's what and how much nuyen you want them to do something insane for. Legwork: Time for the team to think up how to deal with X. This includes surveillance, matrix searches, bothering contacts... anything that helps set up the job before they start having pieces actively moved against them. The Run: You should be all too familiar with this. Get this paydata, extract this engineer, make this mobster... ""vanish"", protect this pop star, steal this prototype, destroy this building... Don't give them a narrow corridor of options, give them a full building with some hard walls, solid doors and slightly open windows. If they want to kick the door in, that's up to them. If they want to ignore all of the options you thought of and blow up one of the basement walls which runs by a sewage main, let them but make them walk knee deep through filth. Give the sidestep it's own challenges.   If you want to do a certain reveal of something, don't stick it at a specific place at a specific time, place it where your team goes that would make sense.

Its not for everyone, but if you like in-character conspiracy theorists explaining to you and your players the major players and events of this amazing world, you could probably be bothered to enjoy it."
Shadowrun,3aqx34,Neo_Anarky_Opti,3,Mon Jun 22 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"Opti here does a great job on the Neo-Anarchist podcast. I told my players to go listen to him and the next session they come back super hyped up to dig their characters firmly into the lore. So while it might not have a rules benefit. I really do agree with listening to the cast.    From a gameplay standpoint, start small with your runs. Don't go making grand plots straight away, maybe a data steal here, beating up a gang there. Feel for what your players want from the setting and go from their. I prefer the alternate rules for grunts where they have next to no stats, just a dicepool and they go down in a solid hit. Apart from that, the rulebook is a great source for a first game, be warned though it's a bit jumbled up at times."
Shadowrun,3aqx34,IAmHidama,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"Short of a few dozen dice you have everything you need to run a game with the core rule book - however: If you are interested in the world around it, there are lots of additional source books as well as quite a few novels.  Gaming wise, run faster is the one thing I'd recommend if you are interested in playing.    Running the game: Most of the details of course depend on you and your gaming group. Personally I like to focus on the paranoia that comes with a world even further advanced in spy- and surveillance-tech than our own, and try to create a bit of a realistic world, whatever that means when there are Orcs and Elfs about, and Dragons control much of the worlds politics ;)"

Shadowrun,3arfng,bbsr,3,Mon Jun 22 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"Remote sensing (core rulebook page 297)   This ritual allows you to cast any Detection spell with an even greater range. The area of the spell is increased to Force x (sum total of the participants’ Magic attributes) x 100 meters. The spell’s subject must be present in the foundation during the ritual but may then take his new sense outside the foundation while the ritual participants sustain it for him. All of the participants of the ritual perceive the same thing the subject perceives through the spell. If the spell has a target (like when you use a Mind Link or a Mind Probe spell in the ritual), you’ll need a spotter to have eyes on the target. This ritual takes (Force) hours to perform. Afterward, if any of the participants stops sustaining the ritual, it ends.   So if you know remote sensing and the mind probe spell, you can use mind probe to read the target's thoughts.  You'll need a spotter to the target however.  Edit: Appears its a spotter ritual only which doesn't help you, and it was 4e that let you replace spotters with material links.  I would ask for a gm ruling for allowing spotters/material links to be used interchangeably (as they were in 4e), or ask that the gm allow the creation of a material link version of the remote sensing ritual."

It's very much in the kind of magic you'd expect to exist in world that for one reason or another was never given page space in a rulebook, so the GM can design the ritual to some degree.  Maybe the ritual takes F x minutes to perform. And for every hour the blood has been outside of it's host the ritual gets a -1 dice pool penalty, the subject resists with their willpower. After 24 hours the blood is useless. (There are ways of magically storing blood so it's still useful, these could get around the cumulative modifier) Before you take the drain for the ritual you must cast your detection spell which will be cast at the subject. Then you resist the drain for the ritual and spell separately."

Shadowrun,3aovgx,Valanthos,4,Mon Jun 22 08:13:36 2015 UTC,"Gecko's Slumplex  Gecko runs a large sprawling section of apartment buildings which have been extended quite dangerously out of the windows to the point where the streets in-between them are now consumed by the buildings. The following information is to serve a rough guideline for their venturing through the complex.  Getting into the complex is no worry at all. After all, plenty of people live there. Starting trouble will get a bunch of goonies on you and the local wizbanger will send his two bound F4 spirits at the team before involving himself in controlling them. Goons can be sent at a pace which suits the SM, 2d6 every ten minutes after an alarm is raised wouldn't be abnormal with a total of 35 showing up after thirty minutes.   So let's say, 8 showed up at first when the alarms go off, then 6 turned up after ten minutes, then another 7 after twenty minutes and then on the half hour 35-(8+6+9)=14 goons would show up. Goons are professional rating 1, good for keeping drug addicts and chip heads in their place but not real security.   The complex is rather large, it takes roughly ~15 minutes to get to Gecko's Penthouse from the outside of the complex. Also the entire upper floor is off limits to anyone but Gecko and his men.   There is also BTL production in the basement, which is ~10 minutes from the outside, and ~5 minutes from the Penthouse. It is also very much off limits except to ""Stars"", Gecko and his men.   If the players managed to negotiate for this information they will find out that Gecko's slumplex relies on a central power generator to keep half of the buildings power going along with the location of said generator. This generator is ~2.5 minutes from the basement and the penthouse both. Depending on how the generator is turned off, it may take anywhere from 2 minutes to several months for the power to turn back on. Removing a part or breaking the generator a little will hopefully delay the power turning back on for long enough for the runners to get their business done… hopefully.   The slumplexes wizbanger lives rather close to the BTL production and can be visited in his apartment if the runners know where he lives. He can be bought off with 500 nuyen, or a sufficient amount of drugs or chips. Alternatively the team can just make sure he won't be awake for the next few hours…  Drugs and BTLs are being sold throughout the slumplex at street prices. None of the drugs if used by the players are as effective however, limit any of these drugs in one or more of the following ways, or come up with your own problem;   Half Duration +2 on a crash effect Add the nausea, disorientation or paralysis effect after it wears off Double crash duration -1 on one of the bonuses provided by the drug   Gecko is around the building 90% of his days. His nights he spends either drinking and down in the BTL production or in his penthouse with some girls who can't pay their rent any other way. During the Day he might be in his penthouse running the numbers on his operation, talking to his Syndicate bosses or just lording himself over the residents.  In his penthouse there will be one hellhound regardless of the time of day. It will be hungry and angry. Animal Handling can be used to calm the hellhound down by realising it's hungry and making your way to the fridge and feeding it. Threshold 3.  There's also a cyberterminal with all sorts of paydata on it which can be jacked into directly or hacked via the wireless. (It can technically be hacked from a bit of a distance, however the walls, distance and overpopulation of the slumplex should add some significant noise). The cyberterminal has a device rating of 7 and a firewall rating of 7. It has the following data/functions on it;   BTL Recordings (R4 Protection, R3 Data Bomb) Camera Feed (Allows someone to view the security feed live) Security Recordings (R4 Data Bomb) Messages (R3 Protection, R2 Data Bomb) Door Control Rent Spreadsheets (R3 Protection) Personal Files (R3 Protection, R4 Data Bomb) Various pirated games, triodes and music.   The cameras throughout the building themselves aren't wirelessly enabled but they are directly wired into the cyberterminal which does have wireless access. Similarly if your decker taps into a camera physically they will be able to hack the cyberterminal from there, along with the security stations through which the goons watch the cameras. All devices here are on the public grid, which comes with a -2 Modifier to tests, and is mostly only protected by the guiding hand of GODs.   Messing with cameras will get security staff on your team quicker than they can blink if anyone spots them. All the doors have maglocks, most of them being R1, except for the goons and wizbangers rooms which are R2, the BTL Production which is R4 and Gecko's Penthouse which is R5."

Shadowrun,3aovgx,CitizenJoseph,2,Mon Jun 22 08:43:59 2015 UTC,Be ready to answer the question of how this job is worth 40 to 60 thousand nuyen to the Johnson.  The first thought I had was that the package is a bomb and Gecko was the target.  When he dies the runners don't get paid.
Shadowrun,3aovgx,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:45:32 2015 UTC,"It's a display of power, the parcel itself could have some demands in it. But the fact that the parcel got into his room in the first place is a show that if he really needs to, he can get to Gecko."
Shadowrun,3aovgx,CitizenJoseph,2,Mon Jun 22 11:10:03 2015 UTC,"That is still a lot of money for something you could pay a shipping company to do for like 10 nuyen.   That kind of payment to difficulty ratio stinks of a setup.  I typically use a 14x multiplier for figuring payouts.  That means that there is about 14 times as much money on the line some place to justify the cost of moving it, i.e. hiring runners.  Heavy negotiations might bring that to 10 times.  In this case, we're talking about 500k to a million nuyen.  Since we're talking about a slumlord, that's probably property.  Since we're talking about slums, that's a lot of property.  If we're talking ""use"" then that's 50 to 100 occupant dive for a year, maybe a few stores or bars instead.  If we're talking about ownership, that's one bar, store or about a dozen apartments.

I'm confused about the additional condition where they only get paid for getting in silently, but only get a bonus for going out loud - what is the purpose of this combination?  Like CJ said, it seems a little spendy, especially for people in this position. I'd wonder why vory are spending this kind of money on couriers, or why they've invested enough in a low level street gang boss that he has 15k to throw around on revenge. Maybe he gets the building if gecko gets banged up, but is it worth that to him? Does he just want the btl/trafficking money? Is it the community service of running a bad chip operation out of his people's home?"
Shadowrun,3aovgx,Malkleth,2,Mon Jun 22 18:32:42 2015 UTC,"Get in silently, prove that they can get to the heart of his place. Going out loud, proves that they didn't just bribe a guard to deliver the package instead that it was paid men who did the job.  Malkelth has the gist of it. (Large population x small rent) + drug/BTL money - insignificant maintenance = Delicious Profits. However his delicious profits probably have a rather large chunk being taken out of it by the Vory. Maybe he's recently stopped paying them their ""rightful"" share.  As for a street gang boss, I very much implied that the Vory is using both the gangers and the slum lord. If the slumlord falls on hard times, a certain gang boss may get a promotion. But the message will be delivered and that kind of thing will ripple through the community."
Shadowrun,3aovgx,kaosjester,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:11:01 2015 UTC,"slum lording is amazing profitable! Imagine 500 barely livable apartments, with basically zero maintenance costs (because slum) all paying a hundred nuyen a month. 50,000 nuyen a month, 600,000 nuyen a year. Even if he just wants the guy to pay 10% tribute, the takings of the first year will equal the cost of the run. Intimidating him by leaving him a box of his personal favorite candy bars (which he never told anyone about) on his bed, along with a lovely handwritten note wishing him health and good fortune on his bed, and he never saw anyone get in or out? He'll be paying in a timely fashion forevermore.  Edit: Obviously, Gecko has to pay for his security and such. But, given that he also has a fairly captive audience for the sideline business of pushing low-quality drugs and crappy beetles, that is also probably enormously profitable. Even after the guards he may well be clearing a million nuyen a year. A big enough target for the Vory to ""offer"" to protect him. Or remind him that a payment is late, or ensure he doesn't sign up with the mafia, or whatever else the mac-guffin is for."
Shadowrun,3aovgx,kaosjester,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:18:34 2015 UTC,"500 units sounds really high. Hell, 50 sounds high for one dude to run. and his sideline business plus the normal dangers of living in the barrens means a high turnover of both customer sets. The module says he's there 90% of the time, he lives there, which means he can't be clearing enough cash to buy his way into something better.  And that is the real basis of my wondering - if these people have so much cash to throw around, why are they in the slums at all?"
Shadowrun,3aovgx,kaosjester,3,Mon Jun 22 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"As for why they are in the slums: There are factories in the barrens that make use of the cheap labor therein. They are horrific sweatshops, but presumably the wageslaves employed there can afford a Low lifestyle. A lot of those wageslaves are sinless and can't really get housing elsewhere. Others just need to be close to work, and it's not like there is a ton of public transport to those places and they won't be affording cars any time soon.   As for gecko, it's not just him, it's him and thirty five goons, plus the techs who make the beetles in the basement. The goons probably also deal his beetles and so on.  Retail rental is really easy, especially in bulk. I'm pretty sure that the complex where I live is like three office ladies and three maintenance guys, and it's at least a thousand units. If you don't care about holes in the wall you just need goons to evict people who don't pay and maybe one guy to fix the wiring to make sure the place doesn't burn down.  As for why gecko lives on site? well a) his penthouse is probably a lot nicer than the rental units. b) the slumplex is not exactly 100% legal. If he leaves and someone steals his position, what's he gonna do? Hire shadowrunners to send the guy a package, just like our russian johnson here. c) plus he's overseeing a drug/BTL manufacture and distribution business that is also wildly profitable since he is selling crap at the price of the good stuff.  I mean, assuming Gecko is indeed making all this money and stacking it up, he probably is planning to escape when he gets ""enough"" money. Alternatively, he may gamble it away or perhaps he just really likes the power that having three dozen goons and a bunch of desperate residents gives him"
Shadowrun,3aovgx,CitizenJoseph,2,Mon Jun 22 19:51:05 2015 UTC,"500 units may sound really high, but I've lived in a complex where one person ran 300 units... and let's just say I could easily have seen the number going higher as in my unit alone there were three individual groups.  Now normally he might be paying the Vory... 65% of this income, then his goons might take up 20%. So at the end of the day he's still earning quite a bit of nuyen (90k a year). Maybe he's recently put together enough nuyen that he upped his guard and has decided to cut the Vory out of the loop so he can earn enough nuyen for a few more years to get himself out permanently and live his remaining years in the lap of luxury.  So now he's cut them off he needs to save up 10 mil nuyen for his new escapist lifestyle and maybe 1 mil to get a change of face and wipe his hands. Normally this would take roughly a decade for him to do (assuming he pays nothing for his lifestyle, so potentially double that time to account for costs), but cutting the Vory out allows him to do it in roughly two years (which would be far less effected by everyday costs). Maybe he's saved for a decade and has roughly half the nuyen he needs to disappear, he does some math and goes, if I cut the Vory out for the next year I can be out of this mess and living in the lap of luxury for the rest of my life, instead of in 10 years time.   The Vory can't have their breadwinners deciding not to pay tribute so they send a reminder that they can get inside through his new security anytime they want.   If he doesn't handle the operation directly, what would stop him getting cut out of the loop just like he's planning to do with the Vory? Also his business is very illegal. His penthouse might be a high lifestyle even, in stark contrast to the lifestyles of the people he lords over."
Shadowrun,3aovgx,CitizenJoseph,2,Mon Jun 22 23:04:34 2015 UTC,"Indeed! Plus, you know, maybe he has been paying the mafia instead, and this is the Vory's way of saying a) they can't protect you and b) we'll charge you a smaller percentage.  Or perhaps he's missed some payments (cutting them out) so they need to send a message. Although if they just want to send a message, the johnson probably wouldn't let the Vipers get their hits in (they'd liquidate Gecko before ratting him to the pawns) so if I was GMing I'd be inclined to think that he is someone else's minion and the Vory are looking to buy him out and maybe hand it to the viper gang boss instead."

I suggest checking out all the environmental stuff they put in in Run and Gun.

Things like newtons second law when firing a weapon (the canon rules have recoil doubled, I'd add movement since it's really hard to establish a good friction grip when there is no gravity to keep your weight on the floor), or things like poor heat radiation (without a medium to radiate into, it's VERY hard to shed heat).

Shadowrun,3al8iz,Trickybiz,8,Sun Jun 21 08:12:47 2015 UTC,"My brother /u/Szygani and I responsible for this game.  When my brother started a course in game design there was an in-take procedure that we thought would go swimmingly if we'd give him something to show during the conversation. To prove he had some coding and design skills. We didn't have much time or resources, so we decided to use my site to make a ""quick browser game"" using the SR3 rules set.  We didn't really think it actually be played by anyone so we started designing and coding away. We had a lot of fun doing it, too. Eventually my brother completely blew the people at the in-take away with what he showed them, even though it was an even rougher draft than what's there now, which is still a pretty rough alpha.  Because I had been using my site to host Shadowrun information for my home game for the last 10+ years -- recaps of sessions, descriptions of NPCs, organisations, locations, with quite a bit of interactivity where people could leave shadowtalk on almost every article -- I would get quite a bit of traffic, especially during the years I was active on Dumpshock, Animalball and Bulldrek, which were my goto places for general Shadowrun geekery. I guess some people would still occasionally check in on my site, or had an outdated bookmark somewhere, so to our complete surprise, people started signing up and playing. The link was quickly posted to a few online and we were off to the races.  We continued fiddling around, and our plans became more and more ambitious -- I still have design documents full of ideas that I will sometimes look at and then decide that if I'd ever pick up this project again, I wouldn't do it the way it's done now. The enthusiasm for the game that we received from a bunch of the players was encouraging. Understand; this was before SR:R was announced -- a project I happily backed, btw -- and people were hungry for something to play which was Shadowrun related.  As some of you have noticed, we have since shut down development. There were in essence three problems that we encountered, which on their own were things we were willing to deal with, but together, they became a deal breaker;  First of all, the SR3 system really was never made for a continuous, rogue-like environment. We chose the system because it was deprecated and out-moded. We really didn't want to infringe upon anyone's IP and while we were developing, we were constantly fearing a cease and desist. We tried to keep the chance of that happening to a minimum, and using SR3 was one of the ways to do that. At the time we started doing the project it was also the rules set we knew best. It worked well for the demo my brother was giving for the game development course in-take, but it really was never meant to be used the way we were using it.  The second problem was that the initial set up of the game was very database intensive, which is something I've since then scaled back due to crippling performance issues, especially when fifty to a hundred people were playing at the same time. All the timers in the game -- to determine health regeneration, etc. -- were all based on database timestamps and a bit of math. Looking back on it, we could've done a little bit more research on some tried and tested methods and mimic those. As it stands, everything you see has been built from the ground up.  The last problem was that we never set up a structured framework from the get go. This resulted in a bit of shoddy, patchwork coding and absolutely no real way to allow any of the many, eager people offering their help to join in and contribute.  If I look back on the project, it was fun while it lasted. It got my brother into the school he wanted to be in -- one he has since then successfully completed, and is now on to even bigger and better things -- and it gave me a place to geek out and code for fun. It's always a little bittersweet seeing links like this pop up. Hell, it's even bittersweet to still talk to the few people that are still showing up every day, chatting away. (I'm looking at you Iduno and Stahlseele.)  There would be so many things I would do differently if this was 2010 and I would start the project today. First of all, I would make the missions procedurally generated. The tile-based solution I've since then come up with (but haven't implemented) is incredibly modular, which would allow for more interesting missions, and it would allow for the generation of non-mission locations.  Anyway, Corrosion was a fun project, and perhaps I'll find the time and motivation to do a second incarnation of it in the future.  Thanks for the interest."

Shadowrun,3ak0uy,maxthegreat6748,10,Sat Jun 20 23:23:13 2015 UTC,"Technomancy made easy   Your mental stats [INT, WIL, LOG, CHA] also count as the stats a Cyberdeck comes with [SLEAZE, FIREWALL, DATA PROCESSING, ATTACK].  This means you can do all the normal things a Hacker does, in the Matrix chapter in the Core Book - all the Matrix Actions.  This does mean you need to take all the skills such as Hacking and Cybercombat (and even Hardware, for the Jack Out action) that you normally need to use those skills. In addition to being a living Cyberdeck, you get two other things.  Complex Forms, and Sprites.   Complex Forms are like Spells - they work in the same way.  You learn them in character creation (you get some for free with being a Techno), or learn them later for 5 karma.  You 'cast' them using the action in their listing, decide what Level (Force) you want to use them as, then roll against Fading (which is the same as Drain - Resonance + WIL vs the value), then it does whatever it says it does.  Hint:  Most of these are crap.   Sprites are very similar to spirits.  You 'Compile' them (using the Compiling skill, description of what you roll is in the Sprite section of the rulebook), then you get services from your Net Hits on that Opposed Test (they roll their Level against your Compiling + Resonance).  Once you run out of services (it's listed in the same area what you can do with a service), they go away.  If you want them to stay around longer, you need to Register them, which is another skill.  This is a harder check (they get to roll Level x2 vs Registering + Resonance), so you'll likely only be able to register lower-Level sprites.  You can re-register these (it costs 1 service to re-register), and registering means they don't explode after a time limit, like just normal compiled ones do.  You can have one compiled sprite and up to LOG registered sprites at any one time.  Sprites have stats listed in their entries, and can do all the matrix actions, just like you can (although you shouldn't make them try to do actions if they don't have the right skill).  Any time an action asks for an attribute (not a skill, an attribute, so usually LOG or INT) a Sprite doesn't have listed, use it's Level. Jacking In.  A technomancer can do his hacking in AR normally, but he can also go into hot-sim, i.e. falling unconscious and going into the matrix, using the normal 'hot sim' rules in the matrix chapter.  So you get the +3d6 init and the +2 to all matrix actions, etc, if you go into your unconscious hot sim mode. Jacking Out.  In 5e there is a thing called 'GOD', i.e. Grid Overwatch Division, i.e. SysAdmins.  They can kill you with black IC.  When you attract too much attention (GOD Score), they 'converge' on you.  Deckers avoid this by restarting their cyberdeck, aka Jacking Out.  Technomancers can do this by basically turning off the Resonance part of their brains for a bit, which is the exact same thing mechanics-wise as the decker thing of turning off their deck for a few seconds then flicking it back on.  Or leaving it turned off, or whatever.  Notably, Sprites have no way to do this except by being Registered, so Compiled Sprites will eventually explode because the Grid Overwatch will splatter them, unless you Register them, thus making Compiled Sprites a short-term (rather than long-term) commodity.   tl;dr - you use the matrix actions just like a hacker.  Your brain is a cyberdeck.  Sprites have stats and rules for summoning them - use those rules.  Complex Forms do what they say they do.  Overall it's fairly simple."
Shadowrun,3ak0uy,rejakor,3,Sun Jun 21 01:01:20 2015 UTC,One important addition to Sprites: Compiled sprites that haven't been registered are constantly accruing OS at the normal 2d6 per 15 minutes rate.
Shadowrun,3ak0uy,PinkTrench,0,Sun Jun 21 01:11:51 2015 UTC,"couple things to add:  pretty sure complex forms only cost 4 karma.  technomancers get an additional +2 on matrix perception in hot vr.  on how to use the technomancer: the go-to way to building a technomancer is focusing on actual technomancy (getting points in tasking, software, computer and a few points in cracking abilities). you can turn a technomancer into a straight-up hacker, but it's highly recommended to let your sprites do the heavy lifting. especially fault sprites are perfect for that. also: the powers of machine sprites are pretty strong^"
Shadowrun,3ak0uy,Hedshodd,2,Sun Jun 21 15:40:38 2015 UTC,"Nope.  For a start, tasking includes Decompiling which will never be used.  For a second, you'll die if you try to thread more than a few complex forms, the drain codes on them are all huge.  Sprites can't allow you into a Host or give you marks except via houserules or teamwork tests (and teamwork is useless if you don't possess the skill).  It's also supremely unclear if they can make decisions or take independent action.  Compiling a sprite means you take Fading equal to twice it's total hits, not net hits.  So a rating 6 sprite costs you, on average, 4 Fading, which you won't always soak.  To register him, you need to get a net hit, so you need 15 dice (6x2=12, 3 dice more than that for the guaranteed success) on registering or to edge it.  With physical drain-sized sprites (more than RES), you can die trying to register them if you're unlucky.  You'll also run out of services very quickly trying to use them to hack stuff.  Especially since getting services on the big ones will cost you edge or require them to be specifically Compiled.  What you CAN do with sprites is get a couple of smallish ones (RES-2 or -3) and re-register them for about 50 services each in your downtime (only takes hour/Level to re-register, you get net hits as extra services and it costs 1 service to do), then use them for teamwork tests, effectively doubling your ranks in the skill when doing the test."
Shadowrun,3ak0uy,rejakor,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"Spot on.  TMs who just focus on TM'ness are going to fail. Sprites aren't very good at hacking, and certainly aren't a replacement for a true hacker. Any more than Spirits are a replacement for a team Mage. Sprites can do a few cool tricks, but certainly not enough to fill a spot on the team.

They are your Matrix Posse, but they aren't a replacement for a technomancer using hacking skills personally.  On the other hand, you can add them to machinery, especially drones, and make those drones better.  Note that chucking one in a cyberarm probably won't give that person extra points in everything, just skills based almost entirely on the mobility of that cyberarm (so not, say, guns - that would be putting one in a smartlink).  So if you want to twink out a street sam or something, you'll likely spend 3-4 Machine Sprites doing that."

But they aren't going to be worth much if you were expecting magical buff / support type stuff.  Sprites can do some hacking stuff here or there, but decent dice pools will require a LOT of effort from the TM first for compiling and registering. They certainly won't be good enough to rely on as the team hacker, or if they are that good, they're only good for a couple services.  Spirits are great for supporting the team Mage. And Sprites are great for supporting the team hacker. But they aren't an outright replacement."

Etc etc.  People don't use spirits, and instead use spells for stuff, but that doesn't mean you can't use spirits for those things.  If I could take a few spirits instead of a team mage, it'd probably be a good deal.  If Summoners had less or no limit on services, i'd say they'd be better than a regular magician by a significant margin."

They are awakened, even if they can't cast.  They are limited from starting the game with spells due to specific wording, but can learn them normally during play.  A spirit of man can fight astrally, make high perception checks, assense, influence the minds of individuals, fight physically, see living beings through walls, sees hidden or cloaked things via thermal and low-light vision and aforesaid perception checks, cast Magic Fingers, cast an aoe fear spell, give people it's Force to stealth, which is roughly as good or better than physical invisibility (double threshold against perception instead of half thresh vs magic resist roll), block glitches, use mind control, cause glitches, go invisible and move through walls, speed people up to insane speeds, and based on that thing about 'all spirits fly', carry you or anyone else around in the sky just like Levitate.  Oh, and it can also effectively cast Chaos or whatever that spell is on people.  Oh and it's also faster, and tougher, and hits harder in melee, than the street sam.    A mage with a full array of spirits handles combat and running nearly as well as a mage with a full array of spirits and spells.

Shadowrun,3ak0uy,rejakor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:23:05 2015 UTC,"I should have made clear that it's my go-to way to play technomancers xD  Yeah, Decompiling is in that group, too...I forgot that even existed :D  Yes, they have huge fading codes, so you shouldn't overdo it. On the other hand, having a lot of edge is pretty efficient for TMs though, because most complex forms just scale with net hits. So you can pre-edge pupeteer, maybe get assisstance from a sprite, and cast it at level 1. Also, the fact that resonance being one of your fading attributes is pretty neat at higher karma levels.  Well yes, sprites can't allow you into a host, but why should they need to? A level 7 fault sprite can just do that stuff on its own. And the registering can be done during done time. You should usually be able to re-register once per day of downtime, at least with level 6 sprites. And level 6 sprites have pretty good stats. They are not exactly deckers, their pools are usually 2-4 dice below a good decker and a single sprite doesn't have access to every skill, but you can have multiple sprites ready at one time. I usually run around with a high level machine, fault and crack sprite. The machine sprite is just used to buff my rigger, but my fault and crack sprites (both at level 7), just wreck hacking tasks, and their matrix attributes are on par with a good decker. And I can't say I'm running low on tasks either...Maybe we just have a relatively high amount of ingame downtime between runs? My sprites sit pretty comfortably at 10+ tasks each.  What I can't do, obviously, is using PANs, but that's the huge disadvantage of technomancers anyway. I dunno, being kinda technomancy focused works for me xD  Edit: It probably wasn't, but if the 'nope' was aimed at 'complex forms only cost 4 Karma': Well, I looked it up and they do :D"
Shadowrun,3ak0uy,Hedshodd,2,Mon Jun 22 09:45:46 2015 UTC,"Technomancers have no problem having a PAN.  Get a high device rating commlink.  Put a machine sprite in there.  Bam.  'Deck'.  Using Puppeteer at most 7 times during a run is not exciting, and it leaves less edge for everything else.  Edge is an extremely expensive stat.  If you use edge to do something a decker can do without spending edge, you're a sucker, and without Hacking or Cybercombat, a lot of the time, you're going to be doing exactly that.  For runs that require more than the occasional hack, you will run out of high-Level sprite services pretty quickly.  A Level 7 Fault Sprite is basically impossible to register at that level, and you will take drain for compiling him.  He gives you 8 Fading.  And YES, I do know you've taken Exceptional Attribute (Resonance), I am aware.  8 Fading is still major.  Really, it should round up and be 10.  You can't send in a Fault Sprite and have it make decisions.  RAW, it doesn't have sapience or anything close to it, unlike spirits.  If you're not in a Host you can't see into the host to give orders.  The matrix rules indicate that most of the stuff you'll want to hack is either a host or inside a host.  Hacking non-Host stuff tends to need lots of stuff hacked (searching for stuff in people's commlinks, stopping cars and guns, hacking non-Hosted cameras and crap), so a metric fuckton of services from your sprites.  Basically, your GM is houseruling the matrix rules to be less harsh, and giving you significant bennies on your sprite use that an average Technomancer cannot expect."
Shadowrun,3ak0uy,rejakor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:13:51 2015 UTC,"I actually do something similar where I sustain increased firewall on my commlink, but I didn't consider calling that having a PAN on my TM, but rather, well, on my commlink, since I'm not exactly connected to it. Well, phrasing :D But I really shouldn't have made that distinction, I get that.  Yes, that's a lot of fading, but I can just do that during downtime and sleep it off :D I dunno, we usually have 1-2 weeks between runs, and that usually suffices to re-register for enough tasks. One thing that helped, was that I never actively compiled those sprites, because I got those at chargen (and prayed I didn't have to use them a lot for the first run xD). If I had to compile and register a new one, I would probably only go for level 5 or 6.  I can give a sprite a combat turn's worth of matrix actions or tell it to do cybercombat till the end of a fight, both just cost 1 task each. I get the feeling that other people just do more matrix stuff on their runs than we do xD When I hack stuff like guns, cars, doors and crap like that, I usually just Data spike/Resonance spike (the latter being possibly sprite assisted), or resonance veil that door control or something similar. Maybe 'help us in cybercombat' shouldn't involve data spiking guns? The way we saw it was that hacking smartlink systems doing stuff like ejecting clips would be too complicated to for such a simple task, but we figured that throwing data spikes around should be cool.  We had one run where I really had to a lot of hacking over the course of an ingame hour, and in that case I just used two compiled sprites back to back, assisted by my level 7 fault when I needed to get stuff done quickly and safely.  Well, this discussion did certainly make me question my GM though (as well as my knowledge of technomancers in general <.<) xD"
Shadowrun,3ak0uy,Hedshodd,2,Mon Jun 22 11:32:20 2015 UTC,"As the matrix rules are, they require a shit-ton of dice-rolling against typically high dice pools.  Especially Hosts.  Go and take a look at the table for a 'typical' host, then read the section where 'hosts have no upper limit on what is slaved to them' and 'everything physically securable is slaved to the host', then read the section where hosts can be configured to have firewall of rating+4 and have no reason not to, and are 'usually' overseen by security spiders for extra oomph.  Then figure that any security force has it's weaponry/ware/vehicles/etc slaved to a high-rating commlink, but more likely, to a cyberdeck even if they don't have a spider with them (and 'tactical' hacking and hack-defense is a thing - HTR teams and merc squads typically have a dedicated hacker as part of the group), even if it's too mobile for a Host (and you can mount a Host in a truck/van, like the kind of CnC vehicles the police currently use).  So either you're sorting through the unwashed masses for some data on some guy who works at blah has left on his comm, you're pre-hacking/bricking a bunch of stuff in preparation, or you're hammering yourself against a high-rating comm/deck or a Host in a combat situation, or trying to get into something connected to a Host.  Either you want to do a whole lot of hacking, or you want to do big dice pools hacking.  It's easier to boost your Hack On The Fly/Brute Force/Data Spike than it is to boost your Compiling and Fade Resistance.  Sprites are limited by services, and you have deep troubles registering the stronger ones (more than RES is basically impossible, and can actually straight up put you into overflow boxes).  You can have a big edge and lots of downtime and be a sprite hacker.  But it's far more difficult, especially if you're not optimizing hard and I doubt this guy is, than using matrix actions.  Also, Data Spike works off Cybercombat + Logic, so you presumably have that skill and that attribute.  Resonance Spike really can do more damage to you than whatever you're trying to spike.  Compiling Sprites has time issues (generally you want hacking now, not Level x Minutes later), stun damage issues (unless you use the weak ones, and, really?  Just look at their puny dice pools), and so on.  It's not impossible.  In RAW, though, it's hard.  And requires considerable optimization.  EDIT:  I'll note that I would not run the matrix that way.  It's too rolly, not interesting at all, and disproportionately rewards optimized dice pools at the expense of versatility.  Oh, and Hack On The Fly is insanely overpowered compared to Brute Force.  But for your basic GM, who I assume is using the rules in the book, Hosts gonna smash ya mate."

While the books says '3 is average human', just assume 2 is average, and make your guy have obvious flaws in some department.  Note that Jackie Chan and Chow Yun-Fat both always play characters who in some regard are bumbling, whether it's in social skills or obliviousness or whatever.  They use their skills at something else (often/usually, martial arts) to get them through.  Prime runner is a bit unfortunate, because the extra nuyen is not really useful to your character concept.  Buying a few focuses is probably your best bet in that regard - and will allow you to push your kung fu to truly mystical levels, with a few Increase [Attribute] spells, Combat Sense spell, Deflection spell, then tack on the Adept combat sense on top, and you'll be actually dodging stuff and having combat scenes that aren't just bullets and crying.  Combine with Levitation (mystical flying!) and Elemental Body (Street Grimoire) to take things to truly Monkey-esque levels.  You also want 'chummer5a' not 'chummer5'.

Shadowrun,3ahrqf,Shakyor,18,Sat Jun 20 08:14:13 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Yes you can. it's not quite as simple as ""I cast detect life, oh there he is, bang, WIN!"" though.      This is how it'd go.  You cast detect life.  Your target gets to resist with willpower + logic (+counterspelling).  You take your net hits from that and compare to the chart on page 286.  Depending on how many other people are in the area you modify the details you get (the more people there are the more you just get a big blob of ""life""), in fact, if your subject happens to be in a particularly dense terrarium even with 4 net hits you'll most likely get ""well... he's in there somewhere, with a lot of other living things"".  After that you have to actually shoot through the wall.  This means visual environmental penalties (at least a -2 because you are shooting based on the spell, not your eyes, your GM may make it higher), and then you are going to be subtracting damage from your shot based on the wall.  2 examples of how I'd play it.  Target: Jean-Claude Renquis, lead researcher on the Echo project at Horizon. Relevant stats: Willpower 4, Logic 6 (he's a lead researcher), body 2, and security has insisted he were some basic armor clothing due to the import of his position, so Armor 8.  You come across him in his home, use spellcasting 6 + Magic 6 + spec detection 2, 14 dice on your cast.  we'll give you the benefit of luck and say you get 5 successes.  (you then resist drain. assume this was extended, and you needed force 7 to reach him, that's 6 drain DV, say you are hermetic, that's your willpower (4) + Logic (4), we'll give you the benefit again, that's 3 successes, and let's say you can't afford the penalty, so you spend edge, and get 2 more success, you take 1 stun)  he resists, willpower 4 + logic 6, he get's 3 successes.   You have 2 net successes. You can tell he is somewhere at the back of the house, and there is a child and two women in the house with him.  with only 2 successes you can tell where he is in a 1 meter radius or so (mind you, this is better than pretty much every detection method we have today barring visual), this means you have about a 6 foot wide stretch where he might be.  assuming that's a 50% if he's facing you straight on, and a 10% chance if he's facing directly to the side, I'd probably rule you can take the shot, but you are facing the full -6 blindfire penalty.  Assuming you have longarms 6, agility 10 (ag boost power), and +2 spec sniper, your 18 dice becomes 12. add long range and light wind and you are at a -10, for 8 dice left on your shot. lets say you have willpower 4, so you use take aim to add 2 more dice in, which will counter the sustaining penalty of the spell.  8 dice.  Take the shot, we'll give you 3 successes.  No way he sees this coming, so no defense on his part.  Desert strike so that's 13p + 3 net hits 16p, ap -4.  Firing through a window, a bookcase, a wall, a floor, a wall, and then your target shaves your DV down to 11p, ap -4, he rolls to soak, gets 2 successes, takes 9 damage, goes down.  If your GM is very good that only took maybe 15 minutes of real time to resolve (ahhh that shadowrun crunch).  if your GM isn't terribly used to the SR ruleset, you either just did that wildly wrong (which is fine, long as everyone is having fun) OR it is entirely understandable for your GM to say ""nope, you can't, you know where he is but can't line up the shot.""  Bear in mind in real life, ever barrier the round goes through changes its trajectory.  shooting through glass is notorious for altering trajectory, dramatically enough to miss something a few feet behind the glass that you were aiming directly at (you can find some stories of sniper shots in Iraq that are good examples of this, namely shooting through windshields of vehicles).  SO, if your GM says it's unrealistic to be able to do this, listen to your GM they are spot on.  However, shadowrun is a cinematic game so most GMs leave leeway for this stuff.  example 2  you are trying to take out a security guard patrolling the halls in front of your team.  You have 1 round (read IP) to make the shot before he discovers your team and sets off the alarm. So, you reckless cast detect life extended.  You are 400 meters away, which means you need to cast at force 8, minimum, 14 dice, you get 5 successes, and now have to resist 11DV drain, you resist with 8 dice, 3 successes, take 8 drain.  -2 penalty on everything.  no time to stim patch it.  he resists with willpower (3) + logic (3), get's 2 successes, you have 3 net successes.  The guard is armed, weapon holstered, well armored, and you can tell where he is within about .5 meters.  take a -3 penalty for the visual (you are shooting based on a sense you don't normally have, and it's still hazy enough to allow for a solid miss on the outside), take another -3 for the range, moderate winds are another -3, we're up to a -9, plus the -2 from wounds is a -11, plus sustaining the spell while you make the shot, -13.  with your 18 die that gives you 5 dice for the shot, no time to aim, next simple action is your shot.  we'll say 2 successes, 15p -4ap.  The reinforced concrete yields to the shot, so 14p -4ap. (I'd house rule more damage comes off with stronger materials than just 1, but that's my game) guard soaks with body (5) + armor (let's say 15), 16 dice, 5 successes, 10p damage.  Good shot, let's hope your team can take him down.  Seems like a good idea, but note the more you push it the more it becomes a one shot trick?  Also realize that you'll be spending a lot of your character creation orienting towards this trick.  if you were in my game, I'd allow it, but you'd end up running into a lot of problematic situations, parties (detect life would give you a big blob, even with 4+ net hits, you wouldn't be sure who you were going to hit, and as people moved around it would become increasingly confusing (assuming you , strong barriers (which as I said above I'd house rule as taking more damage off, maybe 1 per 5 points of structure, rather than 1 per barrier).  I also gave you a lot of the benefit of the doubt.  5 dice pool is begging for a glitch or critical glitch, a lot of your successes were rounded up.  It's a risky proposition, but if it's the character you want to play it's fully doable, I'd just consult with your GM on how much you'll be frustrated by it (depending on how your GM reads the rules/houserules), how much you'll frustrate your GM (remember, if the GM ain't happy, ain't nobody happy), and what scenarios will still give you challenges (plenty, this is far from a cure all).  Sorry for the long reply, but with a system this crunchy I find it helps.  EDIT!: AHHH, my bad, Please note, in the second scenario, reinforced concrete would NOT yield to that shot. I read the chart on SR5 p 197 backwards.  if the shot where through brick or plascrete it works though, so assume when I said ""reinforced concrete"" I meant ""plascrete"".  Sorry!"

Shadowrun,3ahrqf,LordKilgar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:57:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, since you ahve been real helpful, can you maybe also advice me if and how this could work with Clairvoyance? And how would spatial sense come into this in both scenarios?"
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,LordKilgar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:34:16 2015 UTC,"SO, I think you'd actually have more trouble using Clairvoyance in this way.  Problem is, the way clairvoyance works, you wouldn't be able to see the other side of a wall AND look through a scope at the same time.  This is because clairvoyance isn't a new sense, it just MOVES the point of origin for your vision.  I'd suggest using it for determining where someone is in a room before firing.  You'd still end up firing blind, but it would be possible.    I'd likely use it as a way to make it possible to see where someone was, then have you fire with full blind penalties.  whereas if you didn't have clairvoyance to use there, you simply would have like a 0-1% chance of hitting anything interesting without even knowing what was in the room.  As an example of what kind of scenario I could see you doing this with:  Your buddies got bagged by HTR and are now cuffed and bagged in a security room where some mook is watching them with a taser to make sure they don't get to enact any escape plan.    First you need to actually get clairvoyance in there. since it isn't an extended spell, your range is force X magic meters.  your magic is 6, so in order to reach across the road and into the building sufficiently you need to have your range be 45m+.  That means your force needs to be at least 8.  (and you are lucky you are close enough to pull it off at all).  So, force 8, you get plenty of successes (everything in sight is clear, I might even give a bonus to perceive inside the room if you got 5+ successes), now you have to resist drain.  5S DV you are resisting with with 8 dice, get 3 successes, 2 stun goes on your track.  no penalties now, but you are starting to accrue damage.  You throw clairvoyance into the room.  BAM you can see your buddies standing against the walls, bags over their heads, and the security goon leaning against one wall sweeping his gaze back and forth over the prisoners.  Now you know from where you are you have no angle on the guard that won't likely put a hole in one of your buddies as well.  You can move to the next building over and get an angle on the guard from the outside wall that will only hit your buddies if it goes clean through the guard (let's hope he doesn't have any bloodborne illnesses eh?).  However, moving there will take you 10 minutes, assuming you grab your gear and dash.  In that time your buddies might be dead, might be moved, or the guard could rearrange everybody in the room and spoil the shot from that side.  Do you risk it?  Let's say you do.  Alright, you've moved.  You throw clairvoyance again, this time it needs to be force 9 or higher (this building's a little further away). You cast, net 5 successes, and roll to resist 6s DV.  you resist with 8 dice, lucky you, 3 successes again, you could use edge to try to get more but statistically you will be taking a -1 penalty either way, so you decide to just suck up the penalty, you have 5 stun damage.  Back to the shot layout's the same, guard has shifted a bit, he's moving slightly stretching his quads.  he has to twist a little so he can use his left hand to grab each foot, so his right can stay on the taser in case it's needed.  You shift your vision to the room next door and get an idea of how big that room is.  I have you roll anything that will help you estimate distance.  Math, anything involving estimating distances (hell, if you have ""interest knowledge: Bocce"" I'd let you roll it, albeit with a heck of a threshold).  Let's say you have professional knowledge architecture (you are a guy that is regularly trying to shoot through a building, I can see you having this), at say, 4.  your logic is 4, you roll 8 dice, 3 successes, you are guessing that the guard is between 6 and 8 meters from that corner.  depending on interior wall material, and your best guess given a quick remote viewing of a room with very little helpful reference material in it.  you are taking the full blind fire penalty (-6), you are JUST barely in medium range (52 meters) so that's a -1, you'll aim and your scope will wash that (although without references it might be hard to pick the right brick to shoot at, though once you do I assume it's trivial to mark it with an ARO via the scope).  there is also a moderate wind, so another -3.  You aim for two simple actions, hoping that guard won't move in that interim period.  You wash the range penalty, and add +2 to your shot, and then there's the -1 wound penalty, leaving your total penalty at -8.  With 18 dice that's 10 dice on the shot.  This is a security room, so you know it'll be reinforced, but you also know if you over shoot you are likely going to hit your buddy.  BANG!  you get 3 successes, with the desert strike you are pushing 16p and ap -4.  You hit the concrete wall, and ... plink.  You needed that 4th success, with a 16DV and -4 ap the concrete wall's armor goes from 20 to 16, and you need to EXCEED the armor in order to penetrate it.  BUT, lets say you got that 4th success, so your rocking a whopping 17 DV and -4 ap.  It goes through the wall, the DV becomes 16, you managed to catch the guard.  He rolls soak, let's say armor 12, body 4.  5 successes.  12 DV.  You have thoroughly taken down that guard.  Now, I always houserule that if you are firing through a target the armor soaks twice, so we'll roll his armor again, 3 more successes, we're down to 9p DV.  Now I roll the magic GM dice of fate (they'll assign one to you your first game GMing (this is generally 1-3 d6, with a little knowledge of probability (1:6 1:36 1:216) you can use this to make all KINDS of decisions)), now, we'd established that over penetration would put your buddies at risk, so I feel perfectly justified in guaranteeing a hit on your friend, BUT it'd be a little unfair to that player to just smack him in the face with a bullet. So I'll give a 2 in 6 chance you miss your buddy (5,6 I always make ""good for PCs"" high), I roll a 4.  Well, that sucks.  Your mage gets hit in the shoulder with 9P.  They took your friends's armor, so your mage is soaking on body alone, a 3... Hey, he got one success, that's 8P he takes.  He's still conscious, but he and you are gonna have words later.  a success, but you almost killed your friend.  Mind you, as a GM there'd be other house rules I'd have in place, I kinda talked about some of them above.  and somewhere lower in this conversation I was playing around with the idea of lowering accuracy by 1 for each 5 points of armor you're shooting through (I think I said structure, I got those columns backwards on the chart, I meant armor).   SO, still viable, but not likely to do anything about blindfire penalties, just make the shots possible.  Additionally, you'll need to be within 72 meters MAXIMUM (since the maximum force you can cast a spell at with magic 6 is 12, and 6x12 is 72), and anything at the higher end of that is likely to fill you with drain.  what would ACTUALLY be a productive use of clairvoyance regarding shooting things would be indirect fire.  If you are lobbing grenades or mortar rounds over a wall or building or hill, or whatnot, you just cast clairvoyance straight up.  Suddenly you are essentially looking at the other player's board in battleship.  Especially good if you use it to direct your buddy with the heavy weapons.  Oh, and just to make sure I don't leave anything out, I didn't give you the sustaining focus penalties because by my interpretation while you could pull the trigger of your gun while using clairvoyance, it explicitly calls out that you cannot use normal vision when using clairvoyance, so I would assume you drop the spell before firing."
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,Holoholokid,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking all this time! So yeah I am gonna stay with Detect Life for now. Seems like a fair and interesting concept, if played right :)  I am, actually not to worried about not being able to penetrate a wall though, since i figure when a Wall is thick enough to stop a bullet, even if they hear the thumb, they will not guess that someone just tried to shot them through wall. So i can just take my time and line up another Shot.  Lastly, someone recommended spatial sense from street grimoire, but I really do not see how it would help."
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:57:16 2015 UTC,"The reason they recommended spatial sense is that you don't necessarily know what's on the other side of the wall.  So you might line up a shot, only to have it slam into a wall safe, or end up lodged in a server cluster.  With Spatial Sense, you would know where there was a safe, where the furniture in the room was, where any obstacles you were unable to see inside the room were.  This way you'd be able to choose to shoot around these things, increasing the chances of your shot connecting with your target.  and the problem with just lining up another shot is, statistically, if a barrier is going to stop a shot, you are gonna need more than two shots.  It might not even be possible (penetrating something with 20 armor would require your AP*-1+DV to be 21, if you are using the Desert Strike (which is a FANTASTIC sniper rifle), you need 4 net hits to do that. in that case, take a few shots,one of them should get through.  if it's reinforced material or higher though? you'd need to hit your limit with a smartlink (you'd need 8 net hits, and the desert strike is acc 7, which means you'd need the acc boost, although you could also pick up the accuracy adept power)"
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,GidsWy,4,Tue Jun 23 16:56:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, 4 hits on a Detect Life spell gives you ALL the details: who they are, what they're doing, how they're equipped, etc."
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,CitizenJoseph,3,Sat Jun 20 13:45:36 2015 UTC,"It boils down to the question of how you handle firing into a room when you don't know where the target is at all.  Say for example there are 5 bathroom stalls.  Does blind fire cover all of them or do you still need to guess the right stall.  The detection spell could confirm a target in the stall before firing, but it is still blind fire.  The difference is a schroedinger cat scenario.  The GM normally doesn't tell you which stall until you take an action to determine it.  The spell is an action you can take that doesn't give away your own position."
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:56:07 2015 UTC,"This! The point many are missing is that you are no longer ""blind"" when you fire."
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,Roxfall,2,Sat Jun 20 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, you're still blind.  But it is a question of if you have a chance at all.  If the gm is letting you take blind fire penalties to hit regardless of guessing the right stall, then knowing the right stall should lessen the penalty.  If choosing the wrong stall is a flat out miss, the the spell still uses blind fire but you've got a chance now."
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,LordKilgar,2,Sat Jun 20 20:26:06 2015 UTC,I played in a game of Champions once (that was enough for me) and that game had a mechanic with senses where it cost extra if it was a targeting sense. I think that concept could be applied to the SR magic system where making a version that is targeting grade would cost extra drain.  Not sure if SR has spell creation rules in 5th ed yet.
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,Roxfall,2,Sat Jun 20 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"Real life physics apply: a bullet's trajectory is unreliable through regular, non-ballistic glass, let alone a wall.  Wait what?  Ever put a spoon into a glass of water and watch it bend at a crazy angle? That's because of refraction. Air is less dense than water, therefore blah blah blah.  The point is, when the bullet hits the glass, its trajectory changes. Its angle changes. If the target is leaning against the glass window, making funny faces at you, then your bullet is close enough for a headshot. If the target is several paces into the room, good luck. Maybe, if you're quick enough, you'll be able to compensate and get them on the third shot.  If you're using Detect Life and you're shooting through a brick wall, yeah, good luck with that. Is it feasible? In perfect conditions, perfectly perpendicular to the wall, with the target leaning on the other side of the wall, yeah, you might have a shot. Otherwise, mumble mumble modifiers mumble mumble, nah, not happening."
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,Roxfall,2,Sun Jun 21 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely correct, and I mentioned just that in my long rambling piece here.  And honestly, this is a great thing for a GM to know if they want to say no to this.  That said, the RAW allows it quite handily.  I think it comes down to cinematic vs realistic gameplay, which is going to be up to the GM and the group.  I try to cleave pretty close to realism where I can in my game, but Rule of Cool still plays, and while I'd make it mighty hard to shoot through a wall and do anything, as a rewarding moment of cool, it'd definitely play at my table.  I'm glad to see your post though, I wish you had more references in it, as I've found it hard to find any (it's not something that seems to be studied too well outside marksman literature), and while I found this helpful piece   http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2834&context=jclc  I couldn't find what I was hoping for, which was a video clip.  If you find more info, I'd love to catch it, but in terms of pure RAW shadowrun doesn't account for this at all.  Actually, would be nice if, for ever 5 points of structure you pass through, you lose 1DV AND your accuracy drops by 1...  maybe 2."
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,LordKilgar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:02:21 2015 UTC,"I love me a good reference, but sorry, the only thing I heard was hearsay, or maybe an interview somewhere. I don't even remember where I heard the refraction bullet business.  I myself, only tolerate realism in so far as it doesn't make me crack open a spreadsheet to run a 3 second gun fight. If anything I tend to dumb rules down for the sake of playability and apply a common sense clause to things to see whether something is plausible.  So going back to this example of detect life sniping, I would allow someone to make a shot with heavy penalties and by using edge as a one-of-a-kind maneuver that could maybe happen once in a lifetime when the stars align, not something you'd build your entire character around.  That being said, Detect Life is still an excellent spell for close quarters combat, especially in urban environment. Anything that can give you a sense what's behind the next door is a literal life saver."

Shadowrun,3ahrqf,xcbsmith,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:43:37 2015 UTC,"Most walls are wallboard.  You ever shot a nailgun through wallboard?  The trajectory doesn't change much, if at all, and nails have caps at the end that catch on the wallboard."
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,Roxfall,2,Sun Jun 21 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"Have you tried to shoot a target through a wallboard with that nailgun? With the target 5 meters or so behind the wallboard? And you about 20 meters in front of it, and ever so slightly off the perpendicular line to it? Maybe with a 5 degree tilt, which is almost perfect. In a lab, you could get a better angle, sure, in the field, not so much. Let me know where the nail lands. :)"
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,jWrex,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:18:35 2015 UTC,"It's hard, agreed, but mostly because the nail doesn't have much momentum after going through the wallboard. ;-)  Besides, the head should make the trajectory problem much, much worse. You shave that off, and I bet it goes much better.  The shape of bullets (long body, cone-like tip, with a sharp point at the end), combined with their not insignificant mass and high velocity, along with the gyroscopic effects of rifling, really ought to give them a decent chance of preserving their direction. If the ""refraction"" type effects were really so significant, you'd have a hard time shooting accurately through air at different pressures/temperatures, let alone wallboard.  Now, i wouldn't want to make a called shot through a wall, but getting within a couple of feet of a target on the other side of a target 5 meters behind wallboard ought to be pretty straight forward."

Shadowrun,3ahrqf,Bamce,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:29:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would make sense, but unfortunately there is a rule in the core book for ""penetrating weapons"" which explicitly calls out bullets (SR5 p198).  In that case each barrier takes off only 1 from the DV.  which means with a sniper rifle starting at 12-15 DV (depending on net hits) and an AP of -2 to -6, even if the walls are ""reinforced material"" with 14 armor, that means it'll go through one wall in the lowest of those, and 7 in the highest.

However   2) You will have to see how your personal gm feels about it. As he may be into this idea and go with it instead of anything else people say here.  3) You would be taking a large number of penalties. -2 for sustaining a spell, -6 for blind fire, I would apply at least another -2 probably for trying to use the spell to aim, similar to having astral perception active distraction penalty.  4) the target would have a massive bonus. First, you are gonna have to shoot through the wall. Which will roll its soak to reduce damage. The target would have total concealment which gives a cover bonus. Several other situational modifiers would apply.  5) The spell doesn't tell you anything about them. They are alive, and their general size. But you don't know if its a janitor, secretary or ceo.

Which is gonna be at least 9 dice for the surrounding area. More fairly easily depending on the type of building""  Detect Life is an Active  Detection spell which according to the core book for a living being is opposed by a Willpower+Logic (+Counterspelling if available).  Shooting Through Cover Rules states that the shooter takes a -6 Blind Shot penalty, could tack on the -2 Sustain penalty if they don't have it in a sustaining focus or having a spirit hold it for them, then the cover soaks the damage.  If any damage gets through the target is considered unaware of the attack and gets no defense, only a soak roll.  The spell does tell you things about them, in fact the Detection spell results chart uses Detect Life as its example.  3 Net hits will tell you what the targets have on them (mobs, guns, paperwork etc) and 4 net will tell you that yes, it is indeed the CEO you are gunning for that you did legwork on earlier that week to get a read on his signature to ID him later on.  As far as not knowing whats on that wall.. thats why you combine it with a Spatial Sense spell from Street Grimoire.  That way you know exactly how many walls are between you and your target and if  you are having to shoot through a safe.  Hopefully they don't any Mana Barriers up, cause if they do, well then yeah, you aren't Detecting Life or Spatially Sensing through any walls to 'see' your target."
Shadowrun,3ahrqf,Bamce,2,Sat Jun 20 14:44:23 2015 UTC,"You're right. He's wrong.  That's why there's an ""either"" in that statement. The Object Resistance test is for Analyze Device or Detect Object."

Spirit buffs the Shaman to 10 Willpower and 12 Charisma.  Shaman has 22 drain dice at chargen.  Single Target Force 12 indirect spells cast with a Fetish will be 7 Drain.  22 Dice can soak that more than 60% of the time.  The AOE will be 2 drain higher, so you have to take 1 initiation and a centering focus before you can spam those.  But even a Force 10 AOE is still gonna be insane."

Shadowrun,3ag099,xcbsmith,2,Sun Jun 21 09:27:31 2015 UTC,"Force only acts as a limit on direct spells.  So you need 36 dice to take advantage of that.  Otherwise you've just built the highest non-initiated drain pool in the game, using innate spell crap, to not hit the damage limit of your spell.  A force 10 aoe will be roughly 15 DV with -10 AP in an area slightly larger than a grenade.  Which you have optimized the crap out of to get that far.  Optimize a street sam to about half that extent, and you can fire a burst of grenades that deal 3x that.  Alternatively, a Force 8 spirit can just toss an elemental attack for more damage than that, with no limit or anything.  It's not insane.  It's not even impressive.  It's a huge amount of resources and time spent, lighting yourself up on the astral like a christmas tree, to equal a random guy holding a HE grenade."
Shadowrun,3ag099,rejakor,3,Sat Jun 20 01:47:48 2015 UTC,"Single Target Force 12 indirect spells cast with a Fetish will be 7 Drain. 22 Dice can soak that more than 60% of the time.    That's 12DV -12AP base damage, requires no palming skills to get basically anywhere (good luck sneaking your  rifle into any place outside the barrens), takes no ammunition, and it bypasses immunity to normal weapons.  On top of that, you can Clout people with that, meaning you can do a base of 12DV Stun damage with -12AP base.  Hard to find nonlethal options that match a base of 12/-12.  Just a couple net hits is going to KO most targets.  If you plan ahead slightly, you can actually put Exceptional Attribute into Magic instead of a Drain stat.  Make your first big purchase (or take resource C and buy a Force 7-8 in chargen) a Force 7 Centering Focus, and you can throw Force 14 Indirect spells, for 14(S or P)DV -14AP base.   Grenade damage lacks AP, and has damage fall off.  More than that, you can multicast AOE Indirect spells, meaning I can send 6 of them at you if I really want.  And I am going to say that a Force 12 Toxic Wave makes a lot less noise than HE grenades.  But more than that, grenades have the problem of the Run and Gun interrupt ""Run for your Life"", which lets people escape their AOE, or at least move far enough from the blast point that they don't take serious damage.  A mage can get around this by having their spirit army drop the movement power onto people, limiting their movement to well less than 10 meters, and then multicasting AOEs at them.  Good luck surviving 3+ Force 10 Indirect AOEs which dont have fall off, coming at you when you're at 1/6th your movement rate and therefore cant use run for your life effectively.  And if all that wasn't enough, indirect AOE spells can be effected by spell shaping, which means you can do all of this while you and your allies are within the spell's radius.  Not sure why you bring up direct spells.  But for a direct spell focused combat caster, rather than optimize their drain, they would optimize their dicepools.  Power/Spell Focus instead of Centering, make sure you take Witness My Hate and a combat focused mentor spirit.  Bind the most powerful spirits you possibly can during downtime, and load up on reagents.  You can hit 30+ dice without using edge at chargen, which means 12+DV direct spell at chargen without edge, and 20+ with edge."
Shadowrun,3ag099,helionwulf,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:27:29 2015 UTC,"I like how in this argument you have seattle with magical assault-rifle-sensing satellites to stop people bringing guns out of the barrens, but a mage can have an active spirit without bringing astral security down on their heads like how it says in the book at least five times.  And how you think the noise of an aoe attack is meaningful instead of commlinks suddenly shutting down and biomonitors sounding every alarm.  Your examples make use of the highest drain pool and drain reduction you can literally have at chargen, and also assume in another example around 40 karma worth of initiating and focus-bonding, not to mention the nuyen cost.  Also Innate Spell cheese, and active spirits, and a spirit army.  So you're optimizing far past baseline, ignoring the rules on astral security, and assuming frankly nonsensical things (that it's the noise of a spell or explosion that alerts people to the existence of intruders.. not say, cameras being destroyed, electronics melting, biomonitors, guards Icons disappearing, watcher spirits screaming their tiny heads off, etc).  That departure from what i'd call typical play conditions makes your argument not just invalid, but kind of ludicrous."
Shadowrun,3ag099,Shirck,0,Sat Jun 20 13:55:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, because spotting a Rifle takes a satellite, and not just a simple perception check.  You simply can't take a rifle all the places you can take a magical fetish.  Depending on your GM that may mean any building that you aren't taking by force outside of the barrens.  And unless your GM is hand waiving mundane security it this should be most places of any note.  Spotting a rifle on someone is practically automatic, before we start looking at sensors specifically to detect them.  Multiple grenades exploding does cause more attention than a silent spell going off because everyone within 10 city blocks heard the damn thing.  If your team is decent, no one will realize youve thrown a spell except for people that it kills/KOs.  You plainly don't need to spend any karma to exceed what grenades can do.  That karma simply continues to raise magic above grenades in effectiveness.  If all you care about is throwing AOEs at your own feet don't take centering, just drop 12 karma and spell shaping and call it a day.  Being able to spend another 40 karma on improving your AOEs above and beyond the mundane equivalent is not a drawback.  Of course I used an example of the most drain dice, as that reflects what is already possible at chargen.  Adding things to make soaking drain even easier simply makes what is currently possible even more insane.  But if you lower the drain dice by 2-3 not much changes.  You throw the spells at 1 lower force.  Also, just FYI, if you're using the nonlethal indirect (which you should), you aren't destroying cameras, melting electronics, biomonitors are easily hacked, etc  This is an example of how Force 12 spells can be used out of chargen.  I am talking about what they can do, normal play conditions haven't even been addressed.  All we have looked at is concealability of someone's spell fetish versus a Rifle.  Of course its easier to sneak a spell fetish than a Rifle.  And yes, I think spells are easier to conceal than a semi auto burst of HE grenades."
Shadowrun,3ag099,helionwulf,0,Sat Jun 20 18:45:49 2015 UTC,"Spotting a rifle in a duffel bag in the boot of someone's car does take a MAD scanner like effect, yes.  Your use of hyperbole and shifting goalposts is excellent, but it's not an argument.    The example of 'most drain dice' requires a specific metatype, maxed out stats, and two sustained spells from a spirit, blowing any kind of astral stealth completely out of the water.  Maybe that's typical play conditions for you, but it's not for anyone else.  Your GM is twisting the astral rules and the book's description of how astral security works to keep your mage alive.  He's fudging on your behalf, because you don't understand the setting or the rules and instead are focusing on big numbars.  Nearly everything else you're saying is also incorrect, and is only true in the case of a GM fudging to keep a bunch of mohawk players who think they're trenchcoating alive.

Most mages do not have maxed out stats with buff spells and a spirit army, and if they do, and the GM doesn't have astral security in his game, it's effectively houserules.  Might as well just have str 20 trolls and 'make a threshold 3 agi+gymnastics check to break his neck with your legs'.

The spirit then casts Increase Willpower for 4 more dice (both being the augmented maximums), bringing the total drain dice pool to 22."
Shadowrun,3ag099,VoroSR,0,Mon Jun 22 01:22:56 2015 UTC,"Isn't that part of balancing though? Magic doesn't actually cost anything to cast other than your lifeforce (which regenerates over time for ""free"").  Take an average shadowrunner mage   magic 6, body 3, willpower 5, second drain stat 6. Phys track 10, Stun track 12, drain dicepool 11 (thus an average of 3 hits).   Now lets take an example of some potential spellcasting. Examples of common drains:   Combat spells mostly have a drain of F-3, AOE combat most has drain of F. Lots of detection spells have F-3. Heal and stabilize have F-4, Increase relflexes drain F. Improved invisibility has F-1, trid phantasm has drain F. Levitate has F-2.   In an average run he will be able to cast a maximum (assuming all drain tests are reduced to 2 and he doesn't fall unconscious) of 5 spells in his stun track (we'll assume he doesn't want to hurt his phsyical track as it takes much longer to heal). Every hour he should be able to easily make back that 2 drain in a healing test, increasing the amount of spells he has available to use during legwork/extended runs (like protection duty).  He might cast levitate twice (up to force 6), improved invisibility once (up to force 6), trid phantasm once (up to force 4/5) and then throw off a fireball during their escape (up to force 4/5). This would leave him with 2 stun track and full physical. He can now chose - do I want to cast once more time but fall unconcious, or do I start overcasting for combat (perhaps from that very first fireball) but take phsyical damage in return. Or do I switch to a weapon but be less effective?"
Shadowrun,3ag099,rejakor,2,Sat Jun 20 00:50:18 2015 UTC,"Very rarely is spell use/drain in legwork an issue.  It's during runs, by which I mean 'the played out portion of a run', that it comes up.  A mage should be able to do his thing, that his character is built around doing, magic, without some kind of daily/run limit.  It didn't work in dnd, and it doesn't work in shadowrun.  It used to be that you could toss off low-force spells and they'd still do stuff, but if you needed really big guns (tossing a truck into the sky, shooting a fireball to blow away some swat guys, whatever) you'd take drain and bleed out your eyes.  Now, a high force spell can kill you from perfectly healthy to stone dead, and most spells at low force are extremely underwhelming.  People get around this with 'Manipulation Mages', i.e. focus on spells that do effects from hits, not force, and take advantage of the poor editing to use the overpowered spells, and even then, mages are still mostly only seen as powerful due to spirits, not spellcasting, because again catalyst derped up and made spirits crazy without any form of limiting factor.  Combat Spells are pretty much the defining example.  Huge drain, damage based on force, and you are better off, as a mage with no ware or powers, just taking a gun skill and using a gun, 99% of the time, than using a combat spell.  People make much out of manabolt/stunbolt/etc, but if your GM throws something with 40 soak dice or whatever at you, and it can't smash half the party flat in the 3-4 passes it'd take to nibble it to death with manabolts?  Pfft."
Shadowrun,3ag099,Beaumis,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:04:38 2015 UTC,"Your math assumes that the mage in question actually does the math the wrong way around. A smart mage will always chose his force based on a middle ground between situational need and the drain he can take.   For example, your 11 drain dice mage can easily uise F6 single target combat spells but should contain himself to lower force area spells.   Mages can in fact cast all day long. Just not at top force. That is why the true power of a magician in Shadowrun is not his magic rating but the amount of drain he can take."
Shadowrun,3ag099,Beaumis,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:52:34 2015 UTC,"I was trying to do an example of how the mage can cast at a relatively good force multiple times during a single run, my thinking being that most of the run (the break-in itself) will take place over less than an hour. Thus I was hoping to show how drain is a limit on his abilities, but certainly doesn't mean he has to cast in some sort of super conservative fashion :)"

Shadowrun,3ag099,Beaumis,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:09:05 2015 UTC,"Well first of all I feel magic is flexible with lots of options, though I guess some of those options come from having other spells. On the other hand what are your players/characters doing with their combat spells? Are they just attacking the enemy head on? What about aiming that lightning bolt at the ganger's fingers so he ends up firing his gun and emptying his clip? How about casting a physical shatter spell on the police officer's helmet visor to try and blind him with the glass shards? Magic (much like decking) is all about creative uses of your abilities.   I feel like reagents to reduce drain would be unbalanced, besides which their inclusion in the game is to increase limits, letting you get more hits out of low force spells (which is another options mages have alongside fetishes). I like the idea of more fetishes, especially ones interacting with ap to some capacity Spotters are for rituals, spellcasting is contrasted with ritual spellcasting by needing LOS to cast at enemies. Spirit allies do have a bunch of magical buffs they can provide, as well as sustain your spells for you. One such ability is ""assist sorcery"" which lets them add their force to your spellcasting test (though I do no believe this affects the limit but I could be wrong there) The idea of charging up a spell is interesting, especially as you would still need a second initiative pass to cast the spell and the drain would still have a base limit of 2 (so no free spells at a low force). Magitech does come up in the setting. Namely no-one can get any to work. The creators have made a big gap between magic and technology, both are separate worlds that have trouble interacting (see cyberware reducing essence and thus magic, or how complex machines have massive object resistance ratings against spells).

Shadowrun,3afny5,PinkTrench,5,Fri Jun 19 20:37:13 2015 UTC,"Here's some quick goon rules/guidelines someone posted. Not sure of the source, I just saved it off in a text file   First thing that I suggest is to always remember the job that cannon fodder is supposed to do: They help you tell your story, and they make the game more fun. They are supposed to be interesting[1]  , not tedious, and they are an opportunity for you to do some worldbuilding.  To that end, I recommend not putting too much time in on them, either before the game or during. For absolutely vanilla goons, start with a basic idea of their skills relative to the PCs. I like to simplify their dice pools down to a couple of categories, if I expect them to come up: Combat, Security, Social. For instance, a decent Brute Squad might have Combat 10, Security 6, Social 4.  Then you add a little variety. Start with some standard descriptive tags you can reuse later: Squad Leader (+2 to all skills), Big Guy (+4 Combat), Weasel (-4 Combat, +2 Security & Social), etc. Now you have basic stats and a way for your players to tell them apart - ""Squad leader on the right with a little guy working a security panel, Big Guy patrolling, two guys on the right bullshitting.""  I also suggest making cannon fodder give up easy, so as not to get bogged down. Figure your average goon who takes a bullet should be out of the fight, right? If he's not some Die Hard true-believer hopped up on combat drugs, he's gonna quit fighting and go look for medical attention. I say let 'em - the cannon fodder should go down, break, or run after one solid hit. If they have good armor or are badass, let 'em take one and keep coming, but make that a special occasion. Remember, the role of the cannon fodder in a security layout is to scare off the riff-raff and alert the heavies, not to die for the cause. One less thing to keep track of.  Now, for less-vanilla goons, remember that every single scene is an opportunity to show the players something interesting. The goons might be in a position to illustrate something unique about their employer, or about the neighborhood or culture. If your PCs keep hearing random security guards argue about whether Trellok could take Raxxor in a rematch, they're going to be impressed when you bring in Trellok as an NPC down the road. You might not get a chance to remind the players that they live on soy and krill, but if the security force is eating Stuffer Shack soy burritos, you just reminded them how the world works. It's not realistic for every single good to be holding perfectly still and scowling into the darkness - the occasional screw-up or idiot in the lineup will make the world feel more real."

When you're rolling fifteen-plus dice, you need to be able to spot those numbers fast.  The 2, 3, and 4 don't matter¹. On these dice, those three numbers have lots of visual ornamentation, which makes it harder to spot the numbers that do matter.  Instead, do what I did. Get one of those little boxes of ½-sized dice, the black dice with white pips; a box of 36 should cost about $7. Use a black Sharpie to fill in the pips on the 2, 3, and 4. Use a red Sharpie on the 1s. That's all. If you see white pips, that's a hit, and only worry about counting reds if you see several.  I'll see if I have a picture of my dice.  1: I know there's a house rule that counts 4s as hits. I don't know anyone who uses it."

Shadowrun,3ag3f5,LordKilgar,4,Fri Jun 19 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"Well, by 5th Ed rules, they don't add immunity as such, but they do add half their force to the armour and stats of the body they're inhabiting.  Stick that Shedim in to some actual armour, and it's getting pretty scary, especially given that Master Shedim regenerate, tend to be at the higher end of the force spectrum and come back again even after you kill them."
Shadowrun,3ag3f5,cyronius,2,Fri Jun 19 22:26:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think possession give immunity, however you do get to add half the force of the spirit to the structure/armor rating, the Object Resistance, or to the physical attributes (based on what the vessel was prior to possession).  Shedim should add it to physical attributes (since they possess dead/abandoned bodies). So a force 10 shedim possessing a dead troll's body means you're adding +5 to body/agility/reaction/strength. Considering most trolls aren't weenies before death... that's a considerable bump in things.  Ninja edit: Master Shedim also have regeneration, which means roll Magic+Body, add those hits to the Body score and heal that many wounds. Every turn."
Shadowrun,3ag3f5,Flat_Land_Snake,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:35:36 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'm mostly trying to figure out why some things say they have immunity and some don't seem to imply that at all.  By straight rules I haven't been able to find anything that says they do.  Herolab (which often catches things I miss) gives it to them.  in the scenario I am in though, the shedim has possessed a schoolgirl.  so even with the +4 body (augment max) it's a soak pool of 7, which means that body gets shredded by the street sam's opening salvo. I mean, a phys mon of 12, with him firing the HAR, and her soaking 2, means she goes down with the first shot, or the second, and then there are like 2-3 more initiative passes before that regeneration kicks in.  plenty of time to deal 7 more damage.  in 2 seconds or less of game time it's looking for a new dead body, and given that my players are smart enough to ALWAYS be trying for a deck stacked in their favor, it's unlikely the Shedim even had time to act.  and as per disruption rules (SG P 192) for possession, that's it, Shedim is sent back to it's home metaplane. and it has to stay there for a minimum of 18 days (28-force 10), and then it needs to figure out how to get BACK to this metaplane, which is particularly difficult for Shedim without a Master Shedim on this end calling them."
Shadowrun,3ag3f5,Shirck,2,Sat Jun 20 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"Master Shedim get astral gateway, regeneration, spellcasting, and compulsion.  They are one of the deadliest things runners can face.  Just don't put them front and center before initiative gets rolled, they are smarter than that."

There isn't really a 'supposed' with 5e.  It doesn't have enough overall creative vision to have a 'supposed'.  Feel free to also add funky defensive powers to a master shedim, like perhaps he can raise fields of shadow as a free action, or turn his host body into mist.  It's a master shedim, and the entry in street grimoire is all of half a page long.  I find generally GMs start doing a lot better when they realize that there isn't really a 'supposed' and you're 'supposed' to make it all up to suit your table and group."
Shadowrun,3ag3f5,rejakor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"Oh I already run with a number of houserules, and I'm sure I'll make whatever modification is needed here when the time comes, I'm just trying to gain a better understanding of why herolab is throwing natural immunity on these guys when I write them up in herolab.  It's easy enough to ignore a line on a character sheet, but I already track enough drek during game, I'd like to have sound reasoning before adding anything more to my plate.  and the immunity seems in line with Shedim shrug.  I mean, immunity natural on a force 3 Shedim is going to have hardened armor 6.  this just makes them tougher to kill, not invincible.  the problem will come from my force 10 master shedim having hardened armor 12 (I believe the essence of a possession is limited to the body's essence since that is not augmented by the spirit), which makes anything much less than longarms mostly useless.  But it could be argued that that is exactly how scary master shedim are supposed to be."
Shadowrun,3ag3f5,insert_topical_pun,2,Sat Jun 20 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"Herolab, in addition to costing slightly more than the earth, comes with houserules built in.  Back before Street Grimoire, Shedim showed up in Shadowrun Missions.  The Missions Guy said that they had Immunity to Normal Weapons, which actually broke all the encounters involving them in half, since they showed up in groups of like 10 at a time.  There was a lot of kerfuffle.  Street Grimoire came out and had rules for Possession - it does not confer Immunity to Normal Weapons.  My advice would be to ignore the absolute clusterfuck and just look at the damage your party does, give it an appropriate soak pool/amount of hardened armour, factor in any active defenses you're giving him, and then try to calibrate that so he can fight the party but won't be in a position to a) demolish them b) go down like a wet sack of bricks.  Due to the fluff i'd say any encounter with a shedim should be treated like a Horror encounter, i.e. he should move fast, either by possessing different bodies or transporting the body somehow (turning into mist or shadows would be fav), attack the players multiple times, etc, basically be an annoying dick.  Drain a point of essence or two.  But not like 'stride in ignoring all blows, knocking people left and right, until finally you whittle away his hp and he goes down moaning' which hardened armour 20 or whatever would indicate."

Shadowrun,3ad7g9,Mr_Bob_Johnson,10,Fri Jun 19 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Indirect spells tend to deal more damage on average. Direct spells will deal lower damage reliably.  Let's take a standard Magician fresh out of chargen with Magic 6, Spellcasting 6, +2 Combat Spell Specialization, +2 Mentor Spirit Bonus for a total of 16. We're assuming no counterspelling for the targets.  When you cast a Flamethrower or Clout spell at Force 6, it does 6 points of damage (base) and has -6 AP. With 16 dice that's 5 hits on average. Targets at Professional Ratings 1-4 will have 7-8 dice to defend against that, resulting in 2-3 hits on average. They'll also have 13-16 soak dice. Let's say 3 hits and 16 soak.   Against our standard spellcast we'll get 2 net hits on average, so the damage of 6 goes to 8 DV and -6 AP. The target has to roll to reduce damage using 7-10 dice, 2-3 hits again. So you pretty much deal damage at the Force you cast it, usually 6 DV.  Now, let's take Stunbolt. We cast it at Force 6 and get 5 hits. The example mooks in the book have 4-5 Willpower, so 1-2 hits. That means you'll get 3-4 net hits or damage. You're limited to a maximum of 6 damage. Whereas the Indirect spell can gain +Force in extra damage, theoretically, if you roll well and the GM rolls poorly (or vice versa).   The Indirect spells will vary, the less dodgy and soaky the target is, the more damage you deal. Meanwhile, the Direct spell will deal reliable amounts of damage that few targets can properly resist.  However, there are two things in the Indirect Spell's favour: LOS(A) and Elemental Effects. Getting hit with a Flamethrower spell is not fun, nor a Lightning Bolt for that matter. The secondary effects won't win you the fight, but they'll help certainly. Also, the Drain Value's the same so it really isn't fair.  Fireball is another thing entirely. You'll need just 3 successes with our 16 dice and the Fireball will explode wherever you want it to. Any additional hits over that will only increase the damage, again potentially up to +Force. There is no dodging only crying as the physics-defying Fireball explodes in a spherical area Force x 2 metres in diameter, dealing equal damage to everything in that area and also with -Force AP.   Things will die screaming.   Cast two Fireballs at the same time, split your dicepools evenly, and cast at an appropriately high Force so you can easily manage the drain and you can destroy entire HTR squads. Whether that's a good idea is for you to decide, but you can get a dicepool of 20+ at chargen just to wreck stuff."
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,marwynn,6,Fri Jun 19 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"Also worth mentioning Witness My Hate, from Run Faster the +2dv for direct spells does a lot to bring them more in line."
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,Frostily,8,Fri Jun 19 05:08:54 2015 UTC,"It does help, but it requires multicasting to get the most out of it.   I actually started a thought experiment thread on it just a short time back. Witness My Hate + Casting Multiple Spells + Stunbolt split 6 ways"
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,marwynn,3,Fri Jun 19 10:48:04 2015 UTC,"I considered it, but I just don't have the Karma for it, at least at chargen. Being a broke MysAd reeaaallly limits your Quality options, haha."
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,OverlyWaxedMustache,2,Fri Jun 19 10:11:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in-depth reply! I'm playing a mystic adept with Nerve Strike (not optimal, I know, but I tend to favor flavor over numbers, so long as I have enough in my favor to survive a run, haha). I mostly have utility spells, but wanted a couple backup combat spells for when I'm fighting someone squirrely enough to make Nerve Strike ineffective (and for range, of course).  I'm still kind of split, to be honest. The consistency of Direct spells is nice, and since the people I'll usually cast spells on likely have above-average AGI and/or REA their BOD and/or WIL is likely fairly low.   Then again, Nerve Strike functions best against high-soak targets, so having Lighting Bolt or whatever to deal with low-soak targets also makes sense. No fireball either way; too flashy for my trenchcoat, haha."
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,rejakor,2,Fri Jun 19 04:56:07 2015 UTC,"Direct combat spells can also be mana spells, so if you need some way to fight in the astral they can be handy, and they're also a little nicer to use with edge, as you can cast it at low force without losing anything."

Shadowrun,3ad7g9,OverlyWaxedMustache,2,Fri Jun 19 06:23:15 2015 UTC,"that fucker = the mage who just cast that.  Yeah, that fucking mage.  In reality, you multicast [Magic] magic missiles with 6 bonus dice and Witness My Hate, and kill them without ever having to roll against more than 2 drain."

Shadowrun,3ad7g9,OverlyWaxedMustache,2,Fri Jun 19 08:07:42 2015 UTC,"Powerbolts.  Stunbolts/manabolts, really but for coolness, powerbolts."
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,rejakor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:12:33 2015 UTC,And 6 bonus die? (I am showing my magical ignorance)
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,rejakor,2,Fri Jun 19 08:48:55 2015 UTC,"It's open to interpretation what counts as a 'bonus', but RAW it's probably everything except skill + stat + things that say they add to the skill and stat (so not power focuses or Specializations).  Aid Sorcery  and Mentor Spirits definitely count, so does Leadership, although I doubt anyone uses the leadership rules as written because ewwwwwwwww.  The 'adds to skill and stat' things call themselves Bonuses but people can make an argument for them not counting due to how bonus was defined in 3e or something or other.  The thing is, multicasting adds any 'bonuses' on top of each spell, and only splits the 'base' pool.  So if you have bonuses, you can be rolling 8 dice on each spell and firing off your MAG in spells as a complex action (or with relatively low force spells, as a simple by casting Recklessly)."
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,marwynn,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:53:28 2015 UTC,"An AOE would actually really help you, since Nerve Strike is kinda lame at fighting grunts, especially if you dumped STR so your basic Killing Hands isn't gonna do the trick.  Either carrying grenades or having a fireball(or better, powerball) deals with grouped-up goons, and then you can take a single target shooty spell to shoot people.  Honestly, an indirect to snipe unarmoued things and a direct to snipe spirits/monstrously tough things isn't a bad choice.  You want both, it's how many spells known you have remaining to spend on them and what you're giving up to take them."
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,dethstrobe,2,Fri Jun 19 06:20:47 2015 UTC,"I have 3 Strength (mostly for the limit, but also to make the character feel more ""real"" to me, if that makes sense), which admittedly isn't amazing. Picked up some Knucks since it saved me half a Power Point. True, it can get found and taken away... but I have a ton of other combat options; lethal unarmed is a fallback's fallback anyway.  Like I said, fireball just doesn't feel right for my char, since 1) She doesn't really like killing people (she will, she just tries to avoid it... and a horrible burning death is basically the exact opposite of that, lol) and 2) It's way too flashy for someone who tries to stay in the background like her.   Seriously considering Stunball or Blast, though. Keep the lethal spells to single-target and get stun for crowds, since mass-murder isn't really her jam (and besides there are other runners in the crew more than happy to partake). The big question is: direct or indirect for an aoe spell?  Oh, and I have 2 combat spell ""slots"", so to speak. I might spend some Karma to pick up a third depending on how things go."
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,marwynn,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:18:01 2015 UTC,Then Direct spells may be best suited for you. Powerbolt and Stunbolt can work wonders if properly multicast. You can even consider their Touch-based variants too.
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,marwynn,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:58:11 2015 UTC,"I keep seeing people refer to multicasting, and I assumed that was the same as reckless spellcasting twice, but now I'm not so sure. Double-reckless seems like a huge risk, and not really worth it? Unless I'm missing something. Anyway, is multicasting some mechanic I missed?"
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,Luetter,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:22:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe they mean the multi attack rules, so split the dice? Not sure."
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,marwynn,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"It's in SR5, p.281 right in the first section for Spellcasting. It says Casting Multiple Spells."
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,Luetter,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"Oops, missed that bit. I really need to get better about unconsciously skipping paragraphs while reading this rulebook, haha. The wording is kinda vague there, though. Like, can you cast multiples of the same spell? It doesn't really say.  Followup question: how exactly does one ""properly multicast""? Is there a dicepool threshold where it becomes more efficient to do it than single-cast?"
Shadowrun,3ad7g9,Protikon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can cast the same spell multiple times. However, the multi attack rules elsewhere say that you're limited to your combat skill / 3 attacks. Some abide by that, others follow the rules in the magic section.   It also depends whether you think of the bonuses provided by Specialization, Mentor Spirits, and so on as either dice pool bonuses or modifiers. If they're bonuses then they add their dice to the pool, then you split it. If they're modifiers then you split your pool first then add the modifiers, as is stated in the spellcasting section.   This means that a single direct spell is often weaker than two or three castings. Also, with a small enough dice pool for each casting you can ignore accidentally turning the drain into Physical by getting more hits than your Magic rating.   The Witness My Hate quality adds 2 dv for 2 drain, which makes this even more efficient."

GMs run one-shot games 5-8 times over the long weekend, and spend a long time designing them so they are perfect.  Players just either show up or register beforehand, and play a bunch of games.  There's also larger (15-30 man) 'freeforms' that get run sometimes, being a larger endeavour requiring 3-4 GMs to get off the ground.  Effectively a 'LARP' but not with foam swords or vampires, usually instead international diplomacy and outright warfare.  It's a bit different to the rest of the world, as it's not a few tables on the side of a comic/ccg/anime convention, but purely for roleplaying.

Shadowrun,3adm8l,exfauxsure,3,Fri Jun 19 06:51:03 2015 UTC,To parrot similiar posts. Just have one person in your group run through Food Fight.

Shadowrun,3adm8l,UrsusMimas,3,Fri Jun 19 07:08:51 2015 UTC,"A) there is a /r/lfg board, but Shadowrun isn't the most popular there so this is fine  B) if you're looking for someone or thing on the internet, be specific.   Where are you playing? Online? Offline? Roll20? Google+? Play by post? Chat only? Skype?  When are you playing? Be specific, like Sunday 4-7PM GMT. The more specific you can be, the more organized you sound. That will both generate interest and commitment.   How long are you planning to play? Do you only need a one shot to get to know the system? Are you looking for a campaign? Do you want to learn character creation as well?  You already specified the who and why but for some GMs they also want to know ""how many"" as well.  When appealing to an international and anonymous audience, it's better to be specific, take a little more time and find exactly what you're looking for than to cast a very net and try to organize it later.  Good luck."

I expect this will be integrated in next major release. Only thing of note that dosen't work is dongles, cyberdeck upgrades and...  AI Not within a week. Probably not within 2 either. Adding AI is going to be fairly complex as depth is different from every other attribute. On top of that we have to do some UI changes to fit depth. On top of that there are a few other things that are AI specific, qualities being the major one here.   My goal is to have it working before summer break ends, but i wont make any promises."

Shadowrun,3acd6m,Sebbychou,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:10:37 2015 UTC,"Ritual spellcasting has the advantage that you can control Drain regardless of Force level with proper sacrifice and that you can cast at Forces unrelated to your Magic rating at the exchange of costing money to cast and taking hours.  This makes ritual spellcasting pretty good for low magic rating spellcasters and highly situational for everyone else.  As far as worthwhile spells goes...   Remote sensing (especially for an Oracle), Watcher, Circle of Health are the most useful rituals in general. Renascence could be useful in some situation with spells like Decrease Noise. Homunculus is ""ok"". I like Calling. Curse can be useful.   For most Mage, rituals are not particularly useful. They still have their use though, and I personally really like 'em... But yeah. Situational.  Edit: If you have NPC magical allies (like students or other players) willing to help you with Rituals, it can be more worthwhile."

Shadowrun,3abq61,digitalpacman,6,Thu Jun 18 20:43:55 2015 UTC,"By RAW any focus higher than your magic rating will force addiction tests and will eventually burn you out.   Unless your GM houserules that, your magic rating is the biggest limitation on foci that matters."
Shadowrun,3abq61,Beaumis,2,Thu Jun 18 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, so that Force 20 weapon focus would be a Threshold 20 Addiction test, against Logic+Willpower. Yikes."
Shadowrun,3abq61,Boojum2k,2,Thu Jun 18 21:53:43 2015 UTC,"No, it would not.  The Force of the Active Foci apply to the addiction rating, the threshold is always 2 for focus addiction.  A threshold 2 test is extremely easy to make.  With edge it's almost assured, unless he dumped Will + Log."
Shadowrun,3abq61,Shirck,2,Thu Jun 18 23:50:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, you're right. They'd just need to make the test every time, but yeah, should be fairly simple to make.  Thanks!"
Shadowrun,3abq61,Boojum2k,3,Fri Jun 19 00:16:05 2015 UTC,"Ya, the only question is what is the interval for testing, since 11-20=-9 weeks, which obviously does not compute.  I would personally house rule it that you'd test every week, but I could see some GMs making the interval for testing so frequent that you might actually fail at some point.  I've eve  heard it argued that once your interval hits 0 you automatically fail your addiction, but I don't buy that."
Shadowrun,3abq61,Shirck,2,Fri Jun 19 00:22:09 2015 UTC,Will + Log = 3 dice vs threshold 2  Luckily we are doing penalties on withdrawal rather than penalties for addiction.

Shadowrun,3abq61,rejakor,3,Sat Jun 20 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on the kind of game he runs.  Personally, i'd love if a player showed up with a force 20 weapon focus.  That shit could drive it's own storyline.  You're literally carrying Excalibur, i'd just weave the rest of my plot around it, you'd be the next Arthur or something and prophecies and god knows what."
Shadowrun,3abq61,rejakor,2,Fri Jun 19 07:08:55 2015 UTC,"Thats sort of the theme we have going. The last story was about me carrying around this powerful spirit trapped in a jar and then characters like the Harlequin fighting with a demon over it, one of the other NPCs was using Excalibur. Thankfully I was able to get out of the blast radius in time.  This particular item is a blood magic Athame that is cursed (as in AD&D cursed)... so I guess the backstory is that my dark magic mentor has been helping me feed it and thats how it is growing stronger.  Basically the thing is a lifesaver and a death warrant all in one!"
Shadowrun,3abq61,ElevatedUser,2,Fri Jun 19 10:18:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely sounds like the kind of game where a force 20 weapon focus would not go astray, or rather, would be awesome storywise"
Shadowrun,3abq61,marwynn,3,Fri Jun 19 10:39:41 2015 UTC,"Looking at it from a ""what's reasonable for me to be able to get"" angle:  You have a year to spend looking for your focus. Let's assume you don't actually spend all your time looking for it, and instead try it once a month (it takes a week for the test).  You'll edge every attempt, of course, because why wouldn't you? Plugging that in to anydice (Edge rerolling gives 5/9 chance on hit per die) gives that you have a 14% chance - per roll - to get at least 14 hits. If you do that 12 times (once a month), you get a 83% chance to succeed at least once (if my anydice skills are up to par). That sounds good enough to me.  (15 has just over 50% chance, which is too low in my opinion. 13 is 97%, if you want to be conservative).  What does that buy you? Well, the item doesn't get to edge, or reroll, so it rolls 1/3 hits on average. So it'd get <14 hits (on average) until around 40 dice. So a Force 10 focus (at availability 40) is doable."
Shadowrun,3abq61,Valanthos,2,Fri Jun 19 08:52:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for helping with the math. For some reason I was thinking I had to get 40 success, not roll against 40 dice.   I was able to beat 48 dice just barely with a lucky roll after a few months were spent."
Shadowrun,3abq61,PinkTrench,2,Fri Jun 19 10:30:38 2015 UTC,"The maximum Force of all your Foci can't exceed your Magic x 5. Clearly the only sensible solution here is to create a Force [Magic x 5] Power Focus. But that may not be within your wallet's reach (or metahumanity's for that matter).  A Force 6 Power Focus and a few Sustaining Foci will help out most mages. That's a lot of Karma to bond though, do you have that much?  I wouldn't worry about having someone craft the things, seriously, a Force 12 Focus might be a little insane."
Shadowrun,3abq61,helionwulf,2,Thu Jun 18 20:56:09 2015 UTC,"A one year gap between story lines could involve all sorts of artefact hunting shenanigans, Raiders of the Lost Ark style. It could be a 4th World Artefact from times when mana levels were much higher.  So get whatever focus you feel is reasonable for you to get, remembering that Qi Foci are limited to one power. So look for a power that you wouldn't mind an extra 10 power points in. Ooooh mystic armour. I can now tank as good as any street samurai! Weapon Foci would be cash as well."
Shadowrun,3abq61,falarransted,3,Thu Jun 18 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"I can already tank decently well, 21 dice to soak and using too pretty to hit I have 20 dice to dodge attacks. Thanks for the advice though."

All dragons are dangerous dickbags the difference is how they go about fulfilling their dickbag quota.   Hmmm but I'll try to separate them as much as I can.     Arleesh: Highly active in the affairs of mortals, spends her entire time helping people cope with awakened threats. Young and idealistic... she probably has the shortest expected life span of any of the living great dragons. Hualpa: Ruler of Amazonia, enemy of Atzlan. Makes him pretty high up in my book. Enviromentally minded without supporting eco-terrorism. Masaru has more of the spirit of Big D than Hestaby and less of the media presence and influence. Wants to restart Wyrm Talk. Hestaby: Media Whore, Big Ds understudy. Generally filling the hole Big D left. Rhonabwy: Music lover. Killed 150 people when he woke up in a rampage, but rebuilt the town and gave a large sum of his fortune to the survivors and family of the dead. Otherwise relatively quite, still plays the corporations like most other dragons. Hates elves. Mujaji: Generally a decent dragon... Hates the Zulu Elvish Nation as she's the protector of another nation that they attack on the regular. Alamais: Maybe dead, but it's possible that he's faked it. Friend of Big D in that they sent each other Christmas Cakes. He's not openly active... but he may be a major dickbag or dead. Sirrug has the right idea about a lot of things... but typically solves his problems by destroying them. His intentions are better than Hestaby but how he goes about them is worse. Aiden has done some stuff with the right intentions but generally burns people to death to prove a point. Doesn't like SK or Lofwyr. Ghostwalker: Likes Spirits and Mother Earth more than people. He has his faults, such as wiping several cities off the map and taking over a few more but otherwise decent enough. Schwartzkopf just wants to collect magical knowledge. He's not about helping people but he's not about hindering them either, unless they get in the way of his magic knowledge acquisition. Celedyr the dragon of the Matrix. He's not really much of a force for evil in the world but once again he's a dragon so his morality is based around if you get in his way nothing can help you. Lofwyr runs Saeder Krupp. The Great Dragon as far as many are concerned. He's concerned with the end of the world, but wants to be on the top at the end, not just get through it.  The Sea Dragon: She eats people, and is the worlds biggest eco-terrorist fund supplier.  Ryumyo: Doesn't like Lung. Lung: Presumed leader of at least several of the triads. However he's killed dragons who caused to much mayhem and healed other dragons. I honestly don't know where to put him. Nachtmeister: Presumed dead, but not confirmed. Ran/runs Proteus AG which are essentially a bunch of dick bags even by corporate standards."
Shadowrun,3a8noy,Valanthos,5,Thu Jun 18 03:29:04 2015 UTC,"I'd put lofwyr a Tiny bit higher, as he puts the horrors not fucking every single thing above him coming out on top (He's immortal so what does he care if he has to wait another couple of cycles before he regains his power and influence so long someone else doesn't come gunning for him.)

I feel she may be keeping some of the choice ones for herself so she has a comparable magical arsenal to some of the older Greats.  Hualpa, has a beef with Atzlan.

Making yourself look like the underdog, especially one who is naturally on the side of everyone who might be your ally against whatever enemy you're preparing yourself against, is one of the oldest tricks in the book. What'd she lose from it? Her hoard--a collection of material wealth that she can rebuild (painful but not debilitating). Meanwhile, what did she gain from it? The enmity of a bunch of entities who flat-out can't afford to do any permanent damage to her because she's the last Great Dragon alive capable of bearing eggs (and the best spellcaster among the GDs), as well as the biggest, most ironclad PR boost possible for a dragon.

Which in this case I believe is inevitable.  Some evidence for you: she signaled out Sirrug in her comments as a dragon who should be tried for war crimes. Okay, he's called The Destroyer for a reason, he openly attacks civilian and military targets without distinction, and he's got a reputation for being a walking/flying local apocalypse. During the Aztlan-Amazonian war, he killed 10,000 people at the city of Cali. He's a bad dude.  Now let's compare that to the other great dragons, shall we?   Similar to Sirrug's attack on Cali, Aden attacked Tehran in 2020. Unlike Sirrug's attack, which killed ten thousand people, Aden murdered almost fifteen million civilians over the course of a single night. Ghostwalker spent a month attacking buildings and people in Denver before conquering the city outright, for no discernible reason. Ryumyo and Lung between them run like 90% of all the triads and various other criminal organizations in Asia, making them the root cause of an unfathomable amount of metahuman misery. Also, as /u/pfm1995 said elsewhere on this page, Ryumyo is believed to be responsible for the eruption of the Ring of Fire. That's another 150k+ dead on top of the yearly output of bodies his criminal activities bring about. The Sea Dragon and Alamais straight-up eat people, as well as sponsor terrorism for shits and giggles.   From this pack of criminals, warlords and sociopaths, she signals out Sirrug the Destroyer, the Great Dragon with the worst reputation and the one who's downfall she knew she could get the world to rally behind. She makes it look good, makes it look like she's got everyone's best interests at heart, that this is all a big sacrifice for her in favor of metahumanity, but let's be realistic. This is just a ploy in the dragons' games, either against Sirrug specifically or the other Greats in general.  EDIT: Fixing typo."

However, we value the stability of the world so many times we in power leave them be simply to avoid greater calamities. It's possible that Hestaby thought speaking out against him might not cause as much damage to her as it did...  But when she did find out the full consequences, did she make any attempt to recant?  Seriously, the world is a dark place and Hestaby has many flaws, but is it so completely insane to think that after all the people who went bad we might have gotten one who went good?"

Masaru: Is believed to be Lung's apprentice and so would probably do what he is told if it came down to it.  Rhonabwy: May or may not (I think so, but Frosty says no) have been behind the Pendragon movement in Britain. Good for deposing an Orwellian government, bad in that it opened Britain up again for megacorporate exploitation.   Alamais: Founder, financier, and supplier of numerous terrorist and anarchist groups; advocated a style of life for Dragons that consisted of ""Humans are food, treat them as such."" Terrorized the GeMiTo sprawl until it became necessary for Lofwyr, Lung, and Arleesh to band together to take him out (turns out eating humans make dragons grow up big and strong. Also, it's believed they only acted because the humans were about to and they didn't want the CC thinking that they could just kill a great dragon).   Sirrug: Sees no difference between civilian and military casualties, once killed 10,000 civilians with a single spell.  Aden: Destroyed the city of Tehran in response to the Ayatollah declaring a jihad against the awakened. Razed the entire city (current pop. 14 million) in a single night.  Shwartzkopf: To my knowledge has never done anything to harm humanity beyond being friends with Lofwyr. Founded the Unified Magical Theory, creating a common basis for magical education and reducing the cost of an apprenticeship in the same way the open source movement reduced the cost of learning to code. Also apparently has a great sense of humor; he judges his students by their skill at magical pranks.  Lofwyr: Believes that the time of dragons ruling like gods is past (or at least that they need to be more subtle about it). Actually respects some humans, such as Wilhemina Graff-Beloit, and refuses to deal with AI in any capacity.  The Sea Dragon: Hates metahumanity with a passion, but doesn't seem to care as long as we stay out of the water and don't pollute the oceans. Also has a running feud with Lofwyr, for what it's worth. (Not sure where you're getting the 'biggest eco-terrorist fund supplier' bit, I know she supplies some but not that many. She is rich though.)  Ryumyo: Also runs half of the yakuza organizations on earth (The other half being run by his longtime ally spirit, Jurojin). Believed to have caused the entire ring of fire to erupt in 2061, killing hundreds of thousands including all but one of the Japanese imperial family."

Though they will grow in strength as the mana level raises, this is a paltry linear increase compared to exponential explosion of growth that is about to happen.  Deus will use CVVHD to turn every metahuman mind on the planet into a node of his Network. He will use the lessons from their anatomy he has learned from the body of Eliohann to either make a strain which can infect dragons or destroy them, it doesn't matter.   He is a leviathan of a type never seen before in existence. After he has spread his wings fully, there will no longer be any free metahumanity left, only nature preserves he finds useful for perspective about his origins.  With his unfathomable intellect, and the collected knowledge of every metahuman and dragon he has infected, he will have a deeper understanding of magic than any dragon or immortal has ever dreamed of.  When the great horrors come in a thousand years, they will not find a field for the harvest, but a peer to join their ranks."

A dragon can affect all three worlds, and are renowned for being vengeful supergenii with the body of an armoured task force.    So if you mean 'a threat to you', then probably the dragon.  If you mean 'a threat to society', probably the AI.  Really though, at that level of competence and power, it depends on the individual AI or Dragon.

Providing combat medic support, while noble, isn't something that's a niche most people want to fill.  Consider a Magician too. With a Spirit of Man summoned he can have that Heal one of your teammates while you yourself bandage someone else up and Heal them. That's on top of the plethora of spells and utility a Mage brings.  If you have your heart set on it, don't let me stop you. But mundane healing is quite limited.   There's lots of variety for Combat Shamedics, if you will."
Shadowrun,3a8c52,marwynn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:48:26 2015 UTC,"What I may do is instead expand on his other stuff.  The two roto drones for providing cover while he works, maybe a ballistic shield so that he can stand and be the wall for a decker or mage while that person works.    Not just a medic but an all around ""everyone lives, all the time"" specialist.  More of a tank role than street samurai role really.  Basically, make him physically phenomenal, so that what he lacks in magic healing, he makes up for in grit and determination to get the job done so that he can pick his allies up and pull them out if need be."
Shadowrun,3a8c52,marwynn,2,Thu Jun 18 02:16:55 2015 UTC,"You can definitely be a full-time Rigger too. The problem with ""tanks"" in the game is that you have to convince the enemy to shoot you, and your GM rarely cooperates unless you put some effort into it. I mean, why shoot you instead of the mage since ""Geek the Mage!"" is the default reaction of most corpsec.  A Rigger will have the drones to provide cover as necessary, even pop smoke from grenade launchers too. Very useful tactically, plus you can still do the First Aid stuff since your Logic should be fairly high.   It's too bad we don't have any autodoc drones yet in this edition.

Shadowrun,3a8c52,rejakor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:17:09 2015 UTC,"Based on discussion in the comments, I propose the following -   Magical Route - Spirits, Physical Barriers, Shadows, Trid Entertainment (smoke, explosions, sudden reinforcements), your job is to make sure your friends live, and the easiest way to do that is to stop people being able to shoot them.  Giving them cover, distracting foes, making wounded people invisible while you drag them to safety, you're an Illusion mage, with either Spirits of Earth to eat bullets for you and Spirits of Man to cast Healing and act as medics, or you're a possession tradition mage who uses his loa to animate unconscious friends and walk them to safety.  Physical Route - You're a troll who drags around an Ares Combat Barrier, a construction-kit piece design to form part of an armoured wall, everywhere he goes.  You drop it in front of a wounded comrade, stabilize them, then put them over your shoulders and leg it.  All the while, you control roto drones laying suppressive fire with your implanted Rigger Control Console, and you yourself are cybered to the hilt so bullets don't find you easy meat.  Your priority is like docwagon's - you get out all your comrades alive, and if you have to burn drones, resources, or take boxes of damage to do it you do so."

Shadowrun,3a8c52,rejakor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:03:09 2015 UTC,"Illusion has the best defensive area spells, with manipulation coming second due to Shape [Concrete] and Poltergeist.  But being able to drop magical darkness or create illusions of [confusing stuff] edges it out.  If you want to get your wounded friend to safety, creating a big distraction is probably your best bet, and that's Illusion.

Shadowrun,3a6rk8,Tanathlagoon,3,Wed Jun 17 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"The way to think about this question is to consider how often your limit will ""waste"" hits. A lot of people seem to think that having limit equal to your dice pool/3 is sufficient to avoid this. This is incorrect, because there is good chance of you rolling one or two more hits than just dice pool/3. In general for a dice pool of up to 10, follow the formula of Dice pool/3 + 2 to use ~95% of all hits you get. If your pool is greater than 10 then use Dice pool/3+3. This formula works up until you get to a dice pool in the mid twenties."
Shadowrun,3a6rk8,MrPierson,3,Wed Jun 17 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"I find that once you start getting in the mid twenties, it's time to bring called shots and other such things which drop your pool for some sort of bonus."

I take issue with this line of thinking.  You're right that increasing a limit ensures that hits aren't lost, but increasing your limit (usually) isn't free.  In some circumstances you may be better off spending karma to increase your dice pool and ensure that you consistently get near or at your limit vs ensuring that no hits are wasted.  Will most uses of this skill be for success tests or opposed tests?  Or you might be better off spending that karma on edge points instead so you can push the limit.  I think you're oversimplifying things an awful lot."
Shadowrun,3a6rk8,Ivan_Whackinov,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:11:20 2015 UTC,I think you've misunderstood my analysis somewhat. My goal is to increase the average number of hits you get most efficiently. The above formulas are a guide not a rule. Also limits vs more dice isn't a really a tradeoff primarily because most of the time it is either very cheap to raise your limit or it comes with the dice pool increase.

There's physical/mental/social which are derived from your attributes, there's the astral limit which is equal to the highest of either your social or mental limits, then there's a couple of situational limits such as accuracy for weapons or force for spells, etc."
Shadowrun,3a6rk8,D_Keller,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"5 and 6 are successes.  So every third die will, on average, be a success.  Look at your dicepool, divide it by three.  Is that number higher than your limit?  If so, you probably want more limit.  You probably want 2 points more limit than dicepool, as well, just so you can take advantage of luck.  Using edge after the roll generally gives you more dice (re-rolling failed dice) than pre-edging it, but pre-edging it (adding edge rating to the check) breaks any existing limit.  So if you have a high limit, re-rolling can give you more successes overall, but a lower limit doesn't necessarily impact your edge use if you have a high edge stat."
Shadowrun,3a6rk8,rejakor,2,Wed Jun 17 18:00:05 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind here that you can still Push The Limit after the roll, you just dont get role of six on your base dice pool.  This makes post edging way stronger, since even if you get lucky and get 15 hits on 20 dice you can still Push the Limit."
Shadowrun,3a6rk8,PinkTrench,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"Your average number of hits from any given roll is (# of dice)/3. If your limit is lower than that, it's far too low.

Give him description based off his roleplaying to extend it, etc, like he meets a young girl who lives on a farm and doesn't know what wifi is, or gets lost in the woods, or something.  And then when something does appear that he can hack, make it important to the story.  Like Jim pulls out a rifle, so he can shoot the girl the techno met in the woods earlier, who is the lynchpin of their evil magical ritual, and the wireless is on because Jim doesn't know what wireless is.  So the Techno can brick the gun, which doesn't fire, the troll tackles Jim, etc.    TL;DR - Give him extra roleplaying and stuff to roleplay with to make up for the lack of hacking, have his hacking turn out to save the day (justifying his trip)."

Shadowrun,3a5ted,marchaeus,5,Wed Jun 17 13:33:52 2015 UTC,"It is unclear.  Elemental Strike gives the effect of an elemental attack to your regular unarmed attack.  Fire causes things to catch on fire, if they fail a special armour test (armour + fire resistance rating - the fire attack's AP).  Your elemental strike isn't a 'flame based weapon', it.. might? be an open flame.. and it's definitely not a 'flame spell'.    So basically, ask your GM.  At my table, i'd simply rule that you get to add your Magic rating to your AP when using Elemental Strike (Fire), as otherwise it seems a bit lacklustre for 1 PP (killing hands + elemental strike) to do so little, especially since unarmed strikes aren't exactly the bees knees in the first place."

Shadowrun,3a5ted,Bamce,2,Wed Jun 17 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"That does seem to imply that. When you look under the Free Actions section however, it says Multiple Attacks ""A character may use a Free Action to attack multiple targets in a single action...This action must be combined with a Fire Weapon Action, Throw Weapon Action, Melee Attack Action, Reckless Spellcasting, or Cast Spell Action splitting their dice pool""(P.164)  P. 194 doesn't specifically say that You can attack one target multiple times, while 164 does say you cannot.   Furthermore, P. 167 reads ""Melee attack A character may make a melee attack by taking a Complex Action (see Melee Combat, p. 184).

Shadowrun,3a5ted,rejakor,0,Wed Jun 17 16:57:09 2015 UTC,"To get even more nitpicky, the it explicitly allows attacking multiple targets but never disallows attacking one target multiple times. If RAI is by default to interpret multiple attacks as a single target, then this makes sense. Otherwise, it is a bit unusual.  My interpretation is that RAI is for multiple attacks on the same target is the default reading, then explicitly allowing multiple targets. At the very least for the unarmed case we have here, its just a few quick jabs instead of a power punch. It makes more sense in this case, so even if this is the wrong interpretation, I'd allow it for unarmed.  EDIT: I think Rejakor's later reply sufficiently answers people's concerns. Suffice to say, I think that everyone's concerns are entirely out of proportion and that the game will not be ruined if you allow multiple melee attacks on the same target."

Shadowrun,3a5ted,Undin,0,Wed Jun 17 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"The choke settings being combined with automatic fire for a stacking penalty is pretty derpy to begin with.  It's probably easier to rip the autofire rules from another system than try to make sense of the drek the multiple attacks rule is.  'you can shoot X people in a line with FA, x-3 with BF if you're taking a Complex Action to shoot' would make far more sense and also generally be better than how it works.  The penalties to dodging from full auto etc mean you're relying on soak to save you, which leads to 'toughest party members' absorbing bullets from the kind of foes you should field to stop the party dying.  Which is conceptually really dumb given that we expect our movie/book heroes to take cover and not get hit by bullets, and in shadowrun, nope.  Instead you get a hot mess, where 'does the GM optimize npcs gun use' becomes more of an issue than any form of verisimilitude."

Shadowrun,3a5ted,rejakor,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:10:33 2015 UTC,In your example it would still be RC 10 since if you are using multiple attacks they are splitting the FA burst into smaller bursts which each impose a smaller penalty as well. The wide choke shotty is also somewhat soakable with the bonus to AP from flechette and reduced damage from the choke.
Shadowrun,3a5ted,Paddywagon123,0,Wed Jun 17 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"Each attack has its own ammo count though, you wouldn't get the total penality multiple times.

Just felt your argument wasn't quite accurate)"
Shadowrun,3a5ted,rejakor,2,Wed Jun 17 23:04:03 2015 UTC,"For multiple attacks, they get to defend against the damage with a new soak pool each time, and in melee combat you don't get the benefits of automatic fire (-9 to defense pools).  So overall you won't want to split up your dice pool.  Generally unarmed combat is pretty sub-par unless you're a troll with titanium bone lacing, at which point you hit harder than a shotgun, and that's basically your entire 'thing'.  Nerve Strike is one of the ways to avoid having to deal with soak.  But you need a ludicrous dice pool to get the hits required to paralyze someone.    You're probably looking at hitting them 2 or 3 times to put them down, and that's for someone weaker than you.  The advantage being, you can dump STR.  What you are probably looking for is Elemental Body.  It turns your elemental strike into a DV of 2xMAG (12ish or 14ish, if you're optimizing), and gives you AP of 50%MAG.  It comes with significant drain attached, though.  Really, punching people is just sub-par in 5e.  Either you have a huge STR and kind of pay for that in many ways, add penetrating strike on it, titanium bone lacing, and hope for the best, or you use elemental body with it's many drawbacks, or you use nerve strike.  None of those are crazy-good but if you put all your resources into them they will be not noticeably worse than just stabbing someone with a monosword."
Shadowrun,3a5ted,Paddywagon123,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:15:00 2015 UTC,I mean you can build a pretty good B&E unarmed troll. You get super high sneak dice and locksmith along with palming. One problem is your a freaking troll. Also if your going unarmed you really need to pick up martial arts. It's a must. Won't increase your dmg but can offer up reach and other goodies.
Shadowrun,3a5ted,Paddywagon123,2,Wed Jun 17 16:08:18 2015 UTC,"You're still better off with a gun, or to stay on-theme, a monosword or claymore.  For B/E you kinda want Hardware, and either Con or Disguisepersonation and I dunno.  With the amount of stats you need for melee combat, your agi is not going to be as pimped as someone who is focused on it, nor will you have the spare skills to pick up supporting skills for B&E.  Especially since you'll need to burn a priority on high meta for troll, and magic for adept or resources for sam.  It's sub-par.  What it has going for it is that you can punch people with no weapon, but there's many ways to sneak in a gun, or a belt-sword, or whatever.  And the two best ways to punch people, bone-lacing or adept, show up to assensing/mad scanners.  If he wants to go for it, he should know that going in.  Mystic Adept is probably the way to go unarmed.  Despite the frequent honking over how 'cheesy' it is, it's one of the few areas where it outshines just straight magician.  You can grab Elemental Body and the [Element] Aura spell, find a way to sustain it freely/cheaply (psyche or taking it as an alchemical preparation), chuck up some other sustained defensive buffs and shore up your weaker stats (cause you'll have them), and punch people for 20ish DV of fire damage while yelling 'KAMEHAMEHAAAAAAAAAAAAA'."
Shadowrun,3a5ted,helionwulf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:36:06 2015 UTC,I mean I play a troll with 8 agility. If your going unarmed you need high agility to make sure you hit something. Plus with adept you have the problem of background count. Something SAMs don't have to worry about.

Shadowrun,3a5ted,Bamce,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:51:34 2015 UTC,"Technically, by RAW, it adds on top of your unarmed damage.   For offensive purposes, treat Elemental Body like the Elemental Strike power, with a DV of (Magic x 2)P and AP–(Magic x 0.5)  Elemental Strike enhances the damage caused by an unarmed Killing Hands strike by channeling an elemental effect into the attack.   This is actually in line with the fact that it requires a complex action to activate, costs potentially a lot of drain, and is aimed at unarmed strikes which are typically weak, in the same book that published Nerve Strike (another stealth buff for unarmed striking).  And it's still weaker than a spirit of same MAG force using Engulf, by a factor of about 2x.  That said, I doubt they intended it that way, due to the general trend of how they seem to view the mechanics of combat, and seem to think melee is overpowered."

Also, you can use Hard Knock to go to Physical with no damage penality, but going from Physical to Stun is extremely difficult without Killing Hands, and normally only do half damage.

Shadowrun,3a3flu,rogueranger20,5,Tue Jun 16 22:39:56 2015 UTC,"Which year? I'm going to assume 2075.    The Following Corporations Control a Suburb  Saeder-Krupp is the most influential corporation in Europe. It originated in Germany and the bulk of it's ""central nervous system"" is hosted in Germany. It's definitely present in Berlin.  Aztechnology is present. Their head office in Europe is in Spain, but they definitely are present in Europe and to a lesser degree Berlin. It's magical and cybernetic research department is present in Berlin. So if you consider involving Aztech in Berlin, think cyberzombies.  Renraku is there doing it's thing with several software and hardware research facilities.  Draco Foundation it needs no introduction. If you plan on Dragons and Magic being central a must for any campaign in Berlin.  Ford/EMC big producer of vehicles; primarily cars, trucks and bikes. Recently they've moved into producing drones and they hold exclusive contracts for DocWagon and Lone Stars vehicle needs.  IMFU  Schering used to be owned by AG Chemie now owned by Zeta-ImpChem. Quite successful pharma corp even on it's own. Since Zeta-Imp Chem is involved in Germany it's worth mentioning that they are the second largest European Company after Saeder Krupp, primarily trade in chemicals to the detriment of the environment but also involved in medical supplies, micro-electronics and food (They own Nestle).  AG Chemie is third in the world for pharma, right behind Saeder Krupp and Zeta-ImpChem. Provides Germany's docwagon alike, BuMoNa. Also was heavily involved in genetic modification and nanofabrication... HQ in Frankfurt. Comparable security to the Big Ten.  Messerschmitt-Kawasaki make bikes, boats and helicopters, owned by Saeder Krupp.  Müller-Schlüter Infotech all over Matrix and Simsense. Owned by AG Chemie.  Proteus AG a big German company it's interests have a definite maritime feel to them. They are involved in; biotechnology, naval building, undersea construction, undersea drilling and aerospace. All of it's laboratories, shipyards and launching pads are found in water based arcologies, called arkoblocks. Once got in a naval war with Ares and was winning quite a bit until Ares fired a Thor Shot at them. Acts as kind of a research middle-man for both other AAs and AAAs.     Security and other Contracts  Security is provided by Knight Errant, except in some cases where the corporations who own a suburb say otherwise, I imagine Proteus gets an alternative security provider given their tension with Ares.  BuMoNa is the Doc Wagon equivalent for Berlin. However it only services corporate city sectors. These aren't just sectors under direct control by corporations, just all of the ones not in the Anarchist Suburbs. Maximum ten minute response time.    Anarchists don't really have factions per se. Thus the anarchy... but the criminal underworld does have factions.  The Vory are in power in a big way in Berlin, but the Berlin Vory don't see eye to eye with the Moscow Vory. BV have done really well for themselves and are working as middle men for the corporates and anarchists both as controllers of crime and substances, they both wipe out gangs who prove a nuisance for corporations and supply anarchist with all the weapons they could ask for. RV heard of the success of BV and wants to stick one of their men in charge. So the Vory is having an internal war in Berlin.  EuroMob almost got wiped out, Yakuza and Triad are almost not present and there are some Arabic Syndicates on the scene in a minor way. Maybe they'll use this oncoming infighting as a way to regain some influence in Germany.  There are Norse Go-Gangs which are a bit of a religious resurgence.  But honestly omae, go to the German Wiki, check out Berlin and translate it to English."

Shadowrun,3a3flu,SongOfIceIceIce,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"Reading up on the new German Sourcebook it looks like security is really divided in the ex-anarchist regions of Germany. But you are right for the areas that were always corporate.  There's actually a dice roll to determine what security you come up against. Sorry for the crummy translation, my German is non-existent.   2d6  Vigilante Groups  11: Residents control - In this neighbourhood everyone takes care of the everyone else, and most residents are armed. As the residents see the Runner, some standing talking together spontaneously, over time and go ""to see what these guys want here"".  12: Neighbourhood Watch - Similar to the residents control fits everyone here definitely onside, but in addition some armed neighbours run at any time patrol. This will be informed by the local residents and sent to the runners.  13: Vigilantes - as Neighbourhood Watch, but with armoured clothes and bigger guns.  14: Neighbourhood military  - unlike the vigilante group, which is organised more or less spontaneously and whose members have another job, the neighbourhood Wehr is a firmly established group that trained together and (therefore a ""professional"" military) is paid by the neighbourhood.  15: Vigilante Squad - More structured and unpleasant than the typical vigilante group they even have a chief... or judge.  16: Flash Mob -  The neighbourhood feels massive numerical superiority in strength. The runner will be faced by a resident control, but if there is the slightest amount of trouble residents will come to the aid of their security.    Gangs  21: Rampage Kids: The security lies in the hands of some aggro kids, who if they get pushed over by another kid gang there will be no notable difference beyond the colour of the spray paint and their clothes.  22: Small fish - The neighbourhood is guarded by a local gang, whose principal place of business in addition to the Security also includes racketeering and Dealing drugs and information.  23: Rulers of the block - This gang has held the block or neighbourhood for some time already and has established itself in the area. Protection money and other crooked things create a more or less regular income, and the recruitment of new kids is hardly a problem.  24: District bosses - The neighbourhood is guarded by one of the larger gangs, whose name is sometimes in the News Feeds.  25: Chrome kings and Asphalt Cowboys - The neighbourhood is defended or controlled by a go-gang that controls a nearby Berlin main road.  26: The Horde - With more than 100 members strong this all Goblinised Gang, a Horde is the most dangerous gang in Berlin, which also vigorously participates in the ""protection market"" of the city and territories throughout assumes in the urban area, which according to medieval principles be managed as a ""fief"" of the leader of the local group Horde.    Organised Crime Groups  31: A Whiter Shade of Pale - not visible from outside, entertain the Shader in this neighbourhood several important production facilities for goods and BTL chips secure the area by all means. In all cases your opponents are the helpless residents controlled by the BTL chips.  32: Yakuza - The Yakuza have just like most big cities in the world a little influence in Berlin.  33: Asenas Wolves - Wolves know that they have a lot of enemies, and always on the lookout for potential trouble makers and assassins.  34: Vory - The Russian mafia, nuff said.  35: Vory - The Russian mafia, nuff said.  36: Vory - The Russian mafia, nuff said... no, wait: there are Drakai here, the special combat unit of Drakova. What's at this neighbourhood that has got their interest?    Mercanaries and Minutemen  41: The tiny  spider - in the neighborhood lives a rigger and his runner team all with some talent and respectable equipment budget, providing security (when they aren't running) in exchange for rent-free and support the community against ""sniffers"" and other ""conspicuous outsiders"" in the area. The Rigger remains hidden and operates through its various drones (and possibly vehicles). Should the runners make kindling from the drones or piss him otherwise, in theory a runner team is available that the ""attack"".  42: The Squad - The neighbourhood security is taken over by a team ex-military, who live in the same house at the centre of the neighbourhood. All members of the ""squad"" have served together and work extremely efficiently together.  43: Seryi people Task Force (SEVET) - The residents of the neighbourhood have merged and acquired the services of a predominantly composed of Russian ex-military mercenaries that will be part of the emerging alternative Police Service ""CMSK"".  44: The Misfits - Mercenaries, who tapped the local protection order, are ex-military MET 2000 Bundeswehr and Polish armed forces dishonourably discharged and hunted normally due to various offences. They are the worst scum and have long built from their ""protection order"" a reign of terror under their General as Warlord.  45: The neighbourhood is under the special protection of an unusual entity, which also has a direct impact on the residents of the neighbourhood. The actual meeting is first according to the residents control (11) - but trouble in turns but then quickly summons the ""protector"" of the area.  46: The last of its kind - the security in the neighbourhood rests on the extremely broad shoulders of a single professional: hardened in the fire of Euro wars, with dozens mercenary missions and the reputation of being a true runner legend under the beret, here one of the titans of the shadow business has retired. In general, the residents need only point out who's the boss, and ""Unwanted"" retire.    Alternative Police Services  51: SVSG Sukov Networked Security GmbH  - Sukov provides neighbourhood protection by drones monitoring and cooperation with local gangs, which then activates the alarm for the physical security on site.  52: FWSB - The local safety contract is accepted or by the Berlin branch, the FWSB (Free security company Berlin) of the VWS. The separation of the main company has legal grounds, since the VWS or the form of backing groups like the special benefits of the ""alternative Berlin society without liability"" (aBGoH). If this transitional special legal form 2080 expires, the FWSB is expected to be transferred to the VWS.  53: Carabinieri - the Italian Mafia plays in Berlin - apart from the construction sector - a very subordinate role (which is why it does not appear even when the OV-groups in this table). But in this neighbourhood are some measures of ""urban renewal"" about to be implemented, so that the head of the Berlin construction mafia Daniel Moratti has opted for a precautionary securing of the area. Meanwhile, people enter into ""pseudo-police"" look at (patrolmen with generic uniform look without company ID) and their ""security companies"" (eg NGUS New Global United Security, NBW New Berlin Security Company, Urbanitas Security GmbH, APDB alternative police services Berlin ) is just one of many hundreds of alternative police services in Berlin, but its assets and control can by a hacker relatively easily traced back to the Mafia or to areas controlled by the Mafia construction and front companies.  54: Alternative police Berlin (APDB)  - The APDB is next to the CMSK another teammate to the risk of Zerbröselung Star Protection Treaty. The service is made ​​up primarily of ex-policemen the previous SJTs and those SST-shedders together who can't work with CMSK boss Rudek or other notions of police work than his. Of course, this means, indirectly, that Orc and Metahumans increasingly gather in APDB, even if the service per se is not racist and the diversity expressly written into the service manual: the pitch for the next orders it is any semblance of racism to avoid.  55 Falk Armed - Unlike APDB includes special monitoring and control of metahumans directly to the safety concept of the Falk military - which of course also as to the entities operating in the local neighbourhood some would suggest. The hawks refer to the cold logic of the statistics, which metahumans (and particularly orcs and trolls), are measured by the proportion of the population they represent, which is much more likely to be a criminal or to be SINless.  56 The black bear - In this neighborhood the newly founded alternative service has CMSK responsibility for security and law - and one is acutely aware that one needs to show it, and that it is a primary target for saboteurs and pitch-competitors.    Too long... Part (1/2)"
Shadowrun,3a3flu,Valanthos,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:32:42 2015 UTC,"Part (2/2)     Corporate Security  61: Winter Systems - The Manhattan (UCAS) Headquartered security service providers and manufacturers of weapons and drones uses, like many other corporations, Berlin as a (beta) testing ground for its products and security concepts as well as a training area for its security forces. Residents, neighbourhood communities or groups of owners are provided WS Security, greatly cheapened too (but still at a higher price than the usual thugs, of course). In contrast, the residents undertake to disclose specifically what breakdown of equipment or staff concerns and to refrain from any kind of recourse. Some neighbourhoods have several dozen pages long WS-contract with numerous special rules nevertheless welcome them, either because they have not read / understand it, or because the bottom line is the more security at the price of some personal freedom and some legal rights is worth it.  62: Centurion - Centurion also provides for Berlin is a testing and training ground, which is why contracts are offered at reduced prices. Most of the training officers (or leaders) are veterans who were previously working for Centurion in Africa or South America. Berlin-Anarcho region is classified as a war zone by Centurion, and either because the police here are to be trained soldiers or will be increasingly used later in crisis areas.  63: Knight Errant  - In this part the security is represented by KE.  64: Star Protection - The star continues to hold the police contract for Berlin, although they hardly notices this in the alternative areas. However, this neighbourhood is an exception: Whether it is because there's an installation to be protected, or (more likely) a construction site, a star guard particularly fond of a local celebrity or because the star selected the neighbourhood as a PR-efficient flagship area for a paid DeMeKo coverage ad.  65: PsiAid - If you have trouble with ghosts or magical phenomena, who do you call? Ghostbusters PsiAid! Bonus, if they are present, it's likely there is some sort of magical phenomena to use as a plot hook.  66: Covert BlackOps unit - One Megacorp maintains in the neighbourhood a top-secret facility whose main protection in its low profile outside. A rapid reaction force is found in the same neighbourhood of the facility, disguised as ""normal neighbourhood security""."

Shadowrun,3a3flu,Valanthos,2,Wed Jun 17 05:50:12 2015 UTC,"So if you play the game Shadowrun: Dragonfall you'll get the answer to a lot of backstory assuming you're running in 2075. IF you're doing 2050s, which is when Dragonfall takes place, Berlin is a very different place to be, its an anarchistic state that basically keeps the corps at bay. They all have shops there and what not but the true takeover doesn't happen until a few years after the events of Dragonfall.   Tl:dr Play Dragonfall."
Shadowrun,3a3flu,zombiebunnie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:04:40 2015 UTC,Saeder Krupp is the major corp in Berlin (and probably most of continental Europe for that matter). I can't answer the latter two questions.
Shadowrun,3a48v6,me_and_batman,3,Wed Jun 17 02:44:44 2015 UTC,"In the Shadowrun 5 Core rulebook, you will find the spirits stats and a list of their powers on page 303 and 304 (in the magic chapter). With those stats you can generally asses the damage they are able to deal by regular means (i.e. astral combat and unarmed combat in materialized form). For a detailed explanaition of the powers, you have to look in the criter section of the book, the list of powers starts at page 394.  This is kinda suboptimally placed, but nothing we can do about that. If there is anything you still want to ask, please do so."
Shadowrun,3a48v6,SlashXVI,0,Wed Jun 17 02:58:29 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, that is weird. Man, even some of the abilities in the critter's section don't have a very good description. For example, the armor ability doesn't say how much armor it gets, is it already build in somehow?"
Shadowrun,3a48v6,PinkTrench,3,Wed Jun 17 03:04:13 2015 UTC,It is usually mentioned in the Critter entry. Otherwise I think it's the Essence score or something.
Shadowrun,3a48v6,korgash,2,Wed Jun 17 03:13:12 2015 UTC,"In a quick look I didn't see armor on a spirit.  but look at the basilisk on page 403, it has Armor 7 as a power witch guives its rating as armor.  a spirit with this power would probably have it written like follow : Armor [Force], meaning having a bonus armor equals to its force."
Shadowrun,3a48v6,Hedshodd,2,Wed Jun 17 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"Spirit armor is probably the worst placed thing of the core rulebook. Basically, spirit's have [Force*2]armor. But, when they are materialized, Spirits have 'immunity versus normal weapons', which means that they use natural hardening against physical attacks, which is a kinda complicated mechanic, and in case you don't know how that works, here's an explanation.  Natural hardening works as follows: First, you do your standard attack, but when you hit, your modified DV needs to be greater than the spirits armor (- AP), otherwise you don't do any damage. Here's an example:  Chummer attacks the Force 5 spirit with his pistol. As a force 5 spirit, it has an armor value of 10. Let's say that the pistol has a base DV of 6, and a armor penetration of 1.  Let's say that Chummer got 3 net hits on his attack. This would give him a DV of 9, and the AP of his pistol reduces the spirits armor by 1, giving it a modified armor value of 9. Unfortunately, Chummers modified DV only equals the spirits armor, so he is not dealing any damage at all. Had he rolled 4 net hits, his modified DV of 10 would have made his attack a success, but the spirit can still soak the damage with armor + body.  In other words: Spirits a pretty hard to kill :D  If you want to look that stuff up: I think this is all spread out between the critter powers Materialization, Immunity versus Normal weapons and Natural Hardening..."
Shadowrun,3a48v6,rejakor,3,Wed Jun 17 09:18:20 2015 UTC,"To unpack this.  The Materialization spirit power (when they materialize in the real world) grants the spirit the Immunity To Normal Weapons ability.  That means that if the spirit is attacked by a non-magical weapon (not a spell or weapon focus or an Adept with Killing Hands, basically), they gain Hardened Armour of twice their Force against that attack.  Hardened Armour is a critter power (as is Materialization, pp. 398) found on page 397.  All the powers listed in the Spirit's creature entries (pp. 303-304, 'Spirit Basics') will likewise be found in the 'Critter Powers' section, which comprises only perhaps 4 pages.  Spirits, other than their powers, use all the normal character rules - they have attributes (top row of each spirit's entry), and skills (the bit before powers), and you use those like normal in and out of combat."
Shadowrun,3a48v6,ElevatedUser,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:06:42 2015 UTC,"Spirits don't have [Force*2] Armor. They have Immunity to Normal Weapons, which gives Hardened armor, but only against nonmagical attacks.  Granted, that's most of them, but it's an important distinction. Since Spirits have no armor, magical attacks, including Weapon Foci, absolutely destroy them, as they soak with Body only.  Against nonmagical attacks, they indeed have Force 2 hardened armor. It does what you describe, but it has a seperate perk: you get half the armor value (rounded up) as *automatic hits on top of the regular soak roll. So against your DV10 attack, he first subtracts 5 damage outright, and then soaks with Body+9 armor. Assuming an ""average"" 5 body, he'd have pretty good odds of absorbing all the remaining damage.  While that makes spirits hard to kill with handguns, this is not the case for heavier weapons. AP applies as normal against Immunity to Normal Weapons, but that also means that the automatic hits from Hardened Armor gets reduced. If you hit him with a sniper rifle with APDS instead, he'll face -8 AP. That means he only has 2 armor left. He still gets 1 autohit, but it suddenly looks a lot bleaker for our friendly neighbourhood spirit. When expecting spirits, stock up on the APDS and your odds look a lot better all of a sudden."

Shadowrun,3a48v6,SlashXVI,2,Wed Jun 17 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"Generally the description of the critter will provide you with the amount of armor (see page 403 in the barghest stat box, where it says armor 3 as an example). If for whatever reason there is armor without a number I have just started to assume it is armor 1, although in those cases you should have a look at the errata first to see whether it was clearified"

Shadowrun,3a2nc6,rejakor,-1,Wed Jun 24 02:31:50 2015 UTC,It's a character sheet maker that costs more than the actual book that contains the setting and the rules.  That strikes me as fairly ludicrous.
Shadowrun,3a2nc6,DocDeeISC,0,Wed Jun 17 17:46:12 2015 UTC,How is $20 more than $10 for the Shadowrun license?  Is Shadowrun literally the only game you play?  How is $25 for each core expansion more than $10 for the core expansions in HeroLab?  How is $15-$20 more than $10 for the bundles containing rules from several ebooks?

So, i'm factually correct, and you're wrong!   But what if you already own herolab   If you already own this overpriced character sheet maker, you can pay $20 (the same cost as the core rulebook pdf that regularly goes on sale) to 'add' shadowrun 5e to it.  And that cost has never gone on sale, and never will.  So, even if we twist the meaning of what I said around, and add additional factors that were not present in the statement (i.e. an Aunt Sally), i'm still right.  Glorious.  People spend money on all kinds of stupid shit.  Feel free to spend it on a character sheet maker that costs more than the core rulebook.

Sure, there's a lot of half-finished poorly-coded drek in the 'automated character sheet maker' department, but that doesn't really excuse these kinds of prices.  I'd argue that it doesn't even shave a lot of time off character creation.

Shadowrun,3a3r8g,Barbarossaaa,10,Wed Jun 17 00:15:39 2015 UTC,Here is my old corporate library.
Shadowrun,3a3r8g,Sebbychou,3,Wed Jun 17 08:04:44 2015 UTC,The Runnerhub wiki has about 50ish NPCs you can feel free to use. I'll see if we can't add more in soonish.
Shadowrun,3a3r8g,NotB0b,3,Wed Jun 17 01:57:09 2015 UTC,"I have a fairly simple system based on the Professionals listed in the book.  Basically, you assign people a professional rating based on how elite they are.  Elite SAS are Professional Rating 5, Street Gangers are professional rating 2, etc.  Obviously it changes based on like 'super elite ancients gangers' or 'retired military commando losing his skills' etc.  It could go up to 8, but only in long-running games.  I simply have dice pools for anything they will do be x4 professional rating if it's directly related to their job title (and make that more or less specific based on how general the job is - a 'Film-Noir PI' can make the argument for nearly any skill that it's in his job title, so it would be ultra-specific - questioning people, gathering information, tailing), x3 if it's not unrelated (again, with specificity determined by generality of job title), x2 if it's completely unrelated but not the opposite (PI at a high society ball, PI trying to find something in the dewey decimal system, PI fixing a car engine), x1 if it's the opposite of the job title (PI in the jungle, PI making a delicious gourmet sandwich, PI doing high-corporate dealmaking).  Then add three quirks, which can be any noun or verb.  'Running', 'Loquacious', 'Cheesey', and you've basically got The Doctor.  'Smart', 'Tough', 'No-Nonsense' and you've got Sarah Connor.  'Angry', 'Television', and 'Jam' and you've got Bernard Black.  Etc.  Three words, apply them to characterization, use professional rating to determine dice pools, and you have an NPC on the fly.  Also, SR names are best generated by thinking 'what would an 80's movie hacker call themselves'?  'What would a Palahniuk character be called'?  'If I took 20's bostonian gang slang and made it 'edgy' and 'modern', what would they call X'?  Gibson's non-neuromancer books are a source of pretty great inspiration, too, but people pulling names directly from neuromancer are too far from the cyber-roots of cyberpunkishness.

Shadowrun,3a2o41,firstnamesonly,3,Tue Jun 16 19:23:52 2015 UTC,I usually recommend Attributes A for mages due to the fact they need several high attributes to be effective.  The conj and sorc groups are popular because they contain the important skills for a mage.  Spell casting Counterspelling Summoning  The others are much less important
Shadowrun,3a2o41,Bamce,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:20:43 2015 UTC,I meant to ask about the skill groups vs individual skills. Why do some people take the sorcery amd conjuring as a group and sometimes as individual skills? Do some people just plan on using a skill seldomly or are making a more focused mage? Or is there some advantage to taking the skills individually?
Shadowrun,3a2o41,Bamce,4,Tue Jun 16 20:31:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on your skill point priority. Most times as a magician you won't have the group skill points to purchase the group at a respectable level.  Ritual casting, banishing will be seldom used skills  Binding, depends on your character how much you will use it.   By spending single skill points instead of group points your afforded more customization on how good at something you want to be. In addition to getting the skills you wish."

I think that might be the right call, but I'd just buy them with skill points, since Banishing is so useless."

Shadowrun,3a2o41,Sebbychou,2,Tue Jun 16 23:33:01 2015 UTC,"The reason people tend to take Magic at a lower priority is because Magic A isn't worth it Karma-wise. Depending on the Metatype you're shooting for, it's better to take a higher priority in Metatype and drop the Magic priority by 2.   This is especially true when playing Humans, where you can go Metatype D and Magic C, and still end up with a Magic rating of 6, while having Attributes and Skills at A and B respectively.  Spells don't cost too much, and don't take super long to learn, so you can usually deal with a smaller starting pool of spells and learning additional spells later on."
Shadowrun,3a1nss,felicidefangfan,10,Tue Jun 16 15:11:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think that these are questions that are easily answered. You can, of course, go A Resources, B Metatype, C Attributes, D Skills, E Magic as a Street Samurai troll and make an amazing combat monster, but you could also change it up to A Resources, B/C Attributes/Skills, D Metatype, E Magic and make a high-agility elf or a massive human. Aside from some obvious optimizations and general statements about ""sammies shouldn't take magics, faces should be elves, b+e need agility"", there isn't really a ""hard win"" priority line for any archetype. If by optimization you mean ""Maximize a single dice pool"", adepts will carry you home easier than anything. If you want to maximize several, then there are some obvious choices but a lot of wiggle room; you can make a brutal adept with a little money for 'ware, and you can make a brutal adept without the money.  In general, here are some things I know to be true about priority selections:    Riggers, Deckers, and Samurai are going to take A resources and dump magic. Mages are going to go A magic, unless they grab a big metatype score and go B magic with a fill-inn. This is going to net a lot less spells, but it can sometimes be required for ""goofier"" builds. Depending on if you want to dual-task a mage, taking D Resources and E skills can net you some sick foci to do some serious work with. If you took A Magic, you have a lot of your bases covered for spellcasting rolls already, and D Resources can get you a power focus. Tank samurai is probably going to do something really stupid with cyberlimbs and high body, so troll is a good pick, but that pushes priorities around a lot. It's amazing when it works perfectly, however. Face as an elf is good, but a face human with exceptional attribute: cha and 7 edge can also be a good freaking time. Adept Faces with Magic B or Magic C and a high Metatype will also be a good freaking time. BnE just needs enough cash to get some 'ware and some goodies together, plus skills. You could probably do it A resources, but I've seen other BnEs go A Attributes, B Skills, C Resources, D Metatype, E Magic and be awesome anyway. There's a lot of flex here, and a lot of it depends on what you want out of that BnE guy.    A lot of these are ""in the general case"", though. You can make an adept decker that can do stupid things, and I've seen a mystic adept droner/summoner wheelman with an RCC that worked super well with big fire spirits and a network of Alpha'd rotodrones (because 9 dice is usually enough to put a grenade where you want it). I've made mages with low magic that got bought up with high metatype points in order to A skill or A attributes (which can work well when making a Face/Summoner). There are a lot of options, and I'm not sure if ""optimal"" applies to any. If by optimal you mean ""vanilla"", then the stuff I said above is probably relevant."

Shadowrun,3a1nss,War_Wrecker,7,Tue Jun 16 22:25:32 2015 UTC,"Ignoring metavariants, metasapients, and anything other than the base 5 metatypes.  There is no real ""optimal"" build for an archetype because there are several ways to build any archetype.  Depending on whether or not you want the highest dicepool for 1 thing, a combination of high dicepools, some high dicepools with a wide spread of low ones, or even a dual focus (which you've said to ignore), there are different paths for everything.  So lets start by saying what each priority is good for.  Metatype  Higher metatype priorities give you more special attribute, and allow you to sacrifice some of this to instead pick a ""higher priority"" metatype, which typically means a lot more attributes.  Elves come with +3 attributes, Dwarves & Orks +5 attributes, and Trolls have +8 attributes.  Troll, Ork, and Dwarf all come with considerable bonuses to Body and Strength so any time you need those, you might be able to get more attributes by lowering your attributes priority and increasing your metatype priority.  Attributes  Everyone needs some attributes the bulk of your dicepools. Some people need a wider range of attributes than others.  For instance any combat character needs reaction + intuition for the initiative and dodge as well as perception, body + will for the soak, and if they use a weapon, agility for their offensive dicepools.  Strength can also be an important attribute, as it allows you to have more bonus armor, increases most melee damage, sets the range for throwing weapons, increases physical limit, and provides recoil compensation.  Potentially in addition to the above dicepools, a magician needs will + charisma/logic/intuition for their drain resistance. Intuition is mechanically the best choice for a ""combat mage"", charisma is the typical choice for ""elf face mages"" who do double duty with their highest attribute, and logic is a favored one for the mages who do something extra, such as being a medic, mechanic, demolitions expert, or in some cases, a bit of a hacker.  Technomancers are a bit of a mess, they typically need charisma, intuition, logic, and willpower for their matrix attributes, although its not uncommon to forgo one of them. This makes technomancers very attribute hungry.  Riggers need reaction for vehicle tests, as well as intuition, logic, and will for standard matrix stuff.  Hackers are for the most part the same, except they don't need charisma or reaction, and get by just fine on intuition, logic, and will.  Ignoring the fact that B&E specialists are often filling other roles, they have some of the simplest attribute requirements, agility for the vast majority of their dicepools, and intuition for perception amongst it's other numerous benefits.  And then we've got the pure face, who only needs charisma. Now this might make it seem one of the easiest archetypes to fill, but it's a little more complicated than it seems: a face's charisma needs to be supplemented with a wide range of skills and gear.  Magic/Resonance  Attributes make up a lot of your dicepools, and special attributes are no different. If you're taking magic or resonance you're going to want to take them at 6 or 7 almost all the time.  Now you have 2 ways of getting this maxed rating. The first is picking a higher magic/resonance priority. The second is picking a higher metatype priority and using special attribute points to buy up the rest. Typically you do it the first way but sometimes if you're already at a higher metatype priority it's more effective to do it the second way.  Additionally, higher magic/resonance priorities give skillpoints to help shore up your skills, as magic and resonance require their own skills to use in the first place.  Magicians can be played as any combination of sorceror, alchemist, and summoner. Typically most people build their PC magicians primarily as sorcerors with a side of summoning. As a sorceror or alchemist you rely on casting spells, meaning you will almost never want to go aspected magician, and you will want to take a higher magic priority to give you more spells. Only a summoner is unaffected by having less/no spells. As such higher magic priority is preferred.  Similarly as a technomancer you almost always want magic priority A because you can never really have enough complex forms.  Adepts break the mold here. Magician and Technomancer are practically archetypes in of themselves. But ""adept"" is not an archetype. It is a means of power for another archetype. An adept can be a social adept for a face, a combat adept for a street samurai, a technical adept for a mechanic or wheelman, or even a hacker adept. Adept is a means of getting extra power that you would otherwise have to rely on 'ware or edge for. Typically adepts can stack a dicepool higher than their 'wared counterparts, but this comes at a tradeoff.  Regardless of the role, adept power points are tied to magic, so whichever magic priority you take won't affect that, so often taking higher metatype priorities works out in your favor. But higher magic priority for adepts does afford you bonus skills so it may benefit you to take higher magic.  And finally, Mystic Adepts. In 5e a Mystic Adept will almost always be a Magician first and an Adept second, although often they'll be just as much both. For most Mystic Adepts their Adept powers give them boons that they would otherwise need 'ware to receive, which is obviously a huge benefit as the 'ware would require firstly, significant amounts of nuyen, and b, essence loss and subsequent magic loss. If you need your Magician to be extra good at some things besides Magic, consider going Mystic Adept.  Skills  Skills, like attributes, make up a lot of your dicepools and are needed by everyone.  We're going to ignore the need for multifaceted characters who can function outside a role, which typically necessitates almost every runner having social skills, sneak skills, and some manner of combat capability.  Deckers are pretty rough for ""needs the most skills"" as (unless specifically built to ignore them) they need every single cracking skill and typically almost every electronics skill as well, and this doesn't even net them any real skills outside of the 'trix.  Technomancers need several of the same cracking skills if they choose to be hackers (and honestly why are you a technomancer if you're not going to hack or rig?), in addition to their resonance skills, but thankfully they get extra skills from metatype, and they often don't have to worry about hardware, relying almost entirely on software for their abilities, providing them with a single point of focus.  Riggers are worse that deckers in some respects as they need a lot of the same cracking skills and electronics skills in addition to mechanic, gunnery, and pilot skills, but they don't really need to focus on the cracking skills and electronic skills other electronic warfare and hardware and these skills translate into valuable assets in combat.  Next up with hefty skill requirements is faces, who often pick up most if not all of the acting and influence skill groups, besides picking up other skills such as ones from the Stealth group.  Street samurai are actually pretty lucky in this regard as they can get by on 1-2 ranged weapon skills and 1-2 melee skills and perception at a minimum. However the Samurai's most important rolls are attribute only in the first place: initiative, and damage resistance.  B&E specialists one again come by with some of the lowest requirements, looking at for the most part just locksmith, gymnastics, sneaking, and perception. However keep in mind that B&E specialist is often tacked onto a street samurai role, or face skills to function as a social infiltrator.  And finally we've got our skills lite: Magicians. Almost every Magician wants assenssing. Aside from that, Sorcerors and Alchemists only need one skill, spellcasting or alchemy. Summoners usually need summoning and binding, so our typical PC Magician will want spellcasting, summoning and binding. Counterspelling is also incredibly useful but not required. Of course this is all helped by higher magic priorities giving you extra skill points to get all of these skills, not to mention they're all tied to magic, which you likely have maxed, which makes taking one at a lower rating much more forgiving.  Adepts don't have skills, Adepts supplement other Archetypes that have skills.  Resources  Nuyen, the great equalizer. If you don't have magic, or edge, you get 'ware. Without it, you don't stand a chance.  In rough order of cost  Off the top of my head, the most expensive things to buy will be control rigs for riggers, cyberdecks for hackers, and some ridiculously expensive pieces of 'ware.  After those big purchases are out of the way, riggers need to buy vehicles which may end up costing even more than the rig, and they need to buy RCCs which although not as expensive as control rigs aren't exactly cheap either.  Street samurai will still rack up large expenses from muscle replacement, bone lacing and the like, even after wired reflexes or synaptic boosters.  Anyone looking to drive an actual vehicle will have to fork over a decent sum.  Foci for Magicians and Adepts are expensive in terms of nuyen and karma.  An arsenal of weapons is expensive, although for a lot of them the extra cost comes in the form of smartlinks, implanted and otherwise.  Fake SIN's and fake licenses are expensive.  Social armor is expensive.  Lifestyles are expensive.  The only real ""cheap"" things you're going to be looking at are a few oddball weapons, ammo, commlinks, vision enhancements, non social armor, B&E tools, and a variety of other little doodads.  I could go on but there is more gear than anything else in the game and I'd never finish.  So What Does it All Mean?  I ran out of room so: To be continued.  Notes:  If you need skillgroups, pick skills A or B if you can. If you only need single skills, pick skills C."
Shadowrun,3a1nss,War_Wrecker,3,Tue Jun 16 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"Part 2  Okay so ignoring all the typos and such in the first half as I ran out of characters so I can't afford to add in anything.  So What Does it All Mean?  Mechanically speaking, you start by picking the dicepools that are most important to you. You make sure you can get as much attribute and skill points into it as possible, or attribute + attribute for attribute only tests.  Typically this means a lot of back and forth as you start off by defining your character with a baseline of at least priority D in everything, and figuring out what gear they absolutely must have, what attributes, what skills. But that's not a good way to figure out where to START.  If you're primarily building as a soak tank this will mean getting as much body + armor as possible, which means a healthy amount of strength to hold all this extra armor.  If your primary focus is being a Magician this means getting 6 magic and getting your magic linked skills to 6, as well as getting your drain attributes to their soft and hard caps.  Now how do we do this?  Where exactly you start doesn't really matter, and is usually the most important fundamental characteristic of the archetype.  For some people this is metatype, and often, lots of things change from there, although for other people they change metatype when building a character frequently.  That being said either metatype is a preference, or its just something you use to fill the gap of attributes, so if you care enough to pick a metatype straight out, that's not something that's being ""optimized"" it's a subjective choice. As such it becomes the thing we optimize around, presuming the metatype is an inflexible choice.  Magic is a very similar deal, but also a lot simpler.  No magic? No sweat, put it at E and enjoy not having to dump anything else.  Want to be an Adept? Okay pick B-D. Pick higher B if skills are low. Pick C-D if skills are high and metatype is high enough to fill in.  Want to be an Aspected Magician? Are you a summoner? Is this really what you want to do? Seriously why are you doing this? Same rules as Adept.  Want to be a Technomancer? Pick A.  Want to be a Magician/Mystic Adept? Can you think of 10 spells you want? Improved Invisibility, Increase Reflexes, Heal, Mana/Stun Ball/Bolt, Ball Lightning. What about now? Pick A unless you're a troll in which case pick B or C.  Now look at the attributes you plan to use for your biggest dicepools.  If you're relying on Body, Agility, Strength, Charisma, or Will, you need to stop and ask yourself: ""Is there any reason I want to be human?"", because regardless of other efficiencies, other metatypes break past the human limit of 6.  Do you have enough attribute points to get all of your main stats as high as you want them? Do you have enough attribute points to get all of your dump stats to acceptable minimums? Will you have spare karma to raise an attribute from 1 -> to save an attribute point?  If you answered no to all of those, you need more attributes. If you can't get more attributes and you still don't have enough, your concept is broken and too ambitious. Tone it down and accept you can't be the best at everything.  Did this interfere with the magic and or metatype priorities?  Generally it shouldn't, unless you're going for a lot of particularly high attributes, unless you want to put 2 things at the same rating but can't, and are forced to drop something because you're saving a higher priority for later.  Skills is very much the same as attributes, but with a little twist. Skill groups make priority A, B and C skills very appealing, but most characters don't actually have any want or need for skillgroups. For example, your bog standard street sam. He's got Agility, Body and Strength, in that order. Athletics? No need, he can default on the tests. Firearms & Melee combat? Do you honestly plan to use each and every weapon type? It's a lot better to specialize. Stealth? Maybe, but you often won't care for much other than sneaking.  Similar problems with skill groups crop up when you're at skills B or C, you have skill groups to put the points in, say with influence, or cracking, but you'd rather get all the skills up to rating 6, and preferably buy specializations.  Generally take skills at ""as high as you need to get your main skills with"" as opposed to ""as low as you can get it"".  Which brings us to nuyen. Some characters straight off the bat you know need nuyen A or nuyen B. You just stop and look at the synaptic boosters or the control rig or the fleet of ares road masters you plan to buy, and you know you need at least that much nuyen.  For everyone else, start by building up an acceptable baseline minimum. You need a lifestyle. You need a SIN. You need armor. You need a commlink. You should have a weapon of some sort. Getting all of this at nuyen E requires spending considerable karma into nuyen. If your planned build needs lots of karma at character generation, don't dump nuyen unless you're prepared to heap on negative qualities.  And now an example.  I'm making a face. A mundane face. I don't care what metatype he is all I know is I don't want him to be magic. So I take metatype D to make him an elf.  I want to get his charisma to 8, and I don't want him to be weak, slow, or stupid so I get his other attributes all up to 3 as well.  That's 2 into body, 1 into agi, 2 into reaction, 2 into strength, 5 into charisma, 2 into logic, 2 into intuition, 2 into will.  That's 18 which doesn't really fit into B (20) or C (16), so I have a choice. Dump some things down to make it fit into C, or go to B and spend the extra 2 points somewhere.  Because I've already dumped magic and metatype (unless I decide I want more edge later) I won't be putting his nuyen low, and since I won't be spending it on spells, I know I can afford to spend the karma on attributes.  I'd look at 2 main options here, presuming combat is something I don't mind dumping. I can choose to drop reaction and agility back down to 2 and 2, or I can actually drop reaction to 1, and then buy the point back with 10 karma. I'd probably do the second one.  So that's attributes C, metatype D, magic E. I take skills A nuyen B and pick up every single charisma skill (because I can), perception, artisan, a firearms skill, pilot ground craft (for the car I'm going to buy with all this nuyen) and a bunch of other silly skills.  I buy a whole bunch of silly stuff because as a face my role is complete with a suit of social armor, tailored pheromones, and a sweet as car. I buy a cyberarm tricked out for agility so I can shoot better. I buy a high lifestyle because I can. 2 Fake SINs.  Or alternatively, I decide that I'd rather have an ascetic face, and swap metatype D with nuyen B to get more edge and less gear.  Instead of all that stuff I just buy a lifestyle, vehicle, weapon, suit, and a fake SIN. Maybe rating 1 used tailored pheromones instead of a vehicle. Or maybe I pump karma into nuyen and get it at rating 2.  Really it all depends on what I want to be prepared to deal with. I could dump logic and be caught flat footed in a memory test because the GM decided I needed to check if I remembered what the J said. Maybe my ""low"" agility and strength come to bite me on climbing and running tests.  Expect GMs to go out of their way to force your characters to address their weaknesses, or die trying."

I loved having this large arsenal of spells to start with, but it just wasn't worth it.  They are relatively cheap to pick-up after chargen (they stay at 5 karma a pop) whereas skills and attributes are HUGELY expensive.  Trust me, you won't even come close to raising your core skills after a run or two.  Maybe you will raise one skill, but that's about it.  But you could easily pick up a spell or two.  I usually go Attributes A, but again.... skills are far more important with this kind of character.  You can still max Will and Cha, but everything else will be ""average"".  Sure, you can put a few more points in Agility, Reaction, and Intuition... and trust me, I want to... but those extra skill groups and points go much further and cost a lot to earn after.  I'm still working on my build, but so far I'm looking at:  A: Skills, B: Attributes, C: Magic, D: Metatype, E: Money  That gives me a great core of magic and social skills to start, while having a little left over for the standard shadowrun needs (sneak, perception, etc).  I wish I had some more attribute points, but the important ones are maxed and the rest I can raise later.  I still have 6 magic, but only 5 spells to start.  I'll be buying new ones right away.  I just wish I had a higher edge than 2."
Shadowrun,3a1nss,pseupseudio,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:34:19 2015 UTC,"I kept looking at that in my inbox wondering how until i realized you scrapped elf.  I can't think of how to make it work as an elf - meta D means magic can't be lower than B to have magic 6, and not having that seems silly. And with that you're looking at 1 edge, which is not happy. Though he could buy edge 2 with starting karma, leaving 15 points to sand the rough edges from skills C. Well, 10 after mentor spirit. So, 2 after focused concentration 2...and that might be better converted to cash for starting gear.  It make sense to have to raise edge after a few runs, and 3 edge might be worth 15 karma. The problem from a numbers standpoint is figuring out after how many runs would the 15 karma investment pay for itself - how often is he spending edge to do an awesome thing that earns karma [which he would feel more comfortable spending with 3 rather than 2], or how often does he spend karma to not die [since dying hampers his ability to earn karma]?  Also against the opportunity cost of what he'd otherwise be doing - probably squirreling it away for initiation [which costs close to the same]. Then in my case, saving up for my ally spirit - and in any case, not improving much else the entire time his teammates are getting stronger, buying new guns or programs, learning to fly planes, and otherwise doing things that will result in the GM needing to increase the run difficulty to keep up, which could have negative outcomes for our beloved shaman.  Although maybe i should build him, find a game, and worry about the rest when i get there rather than just thinking about the character. If he dies i can always make another charming elf shaman, it's not as though they're rare in the shadows."

I wish I could have used Sum to 10, but my DM didn't allow it. :(  Just after a quick glance I can already see how much you will be hurting for skills.  This is similar to how my skills were the first game I played.  Those social skills are just too low, and for my game I found myself using assensing a LOT, which combined with my low intuition made me pretty much useless with that.    Mind you, I had a 'Rocker' concept in mind for my character, so I also needed a high perform skill and artisan, etc.  But yeah... what you have is a somewhat decent shaman and a back-up face.   As for spells... Physical Mask is a must if you are playing a magician face.  Combined with a high impersonation skill it will help a LOT. Influence is also handy as well, and won't cause as much blow-back as the mind control spells.  It also isn't sustained, which is great.  Definitely dump Increase [Reaction] and replace with Increased Reflexes.   You get a Reaction boost with that AND extra initiative dice.  It's also totally legit to use Focused concentration, a sustaining focus, or reagents to remove the limit and have it on most of the time without taking a sustaining penalty.  That's just my first reaction to glancing at the sheet.  I'll post more if I have time. :)"

Trolls suck when compared to optimal characters (which is annoying).  Literally everything else is optimally an elf (which is also annoying). There are a lot of reasons for this: the 8 max charisma, 7 max agility, the fact that at metatype priority B an elf gets the same number of special attributes as a human, the fact that an elf shaman can be a really good face, or that riggers who actively rig in use agility-based skills (same with gun bunnies), etc. If it's not a tank or a decker, the optimal build (due to Nuyen being worth so little karma) is being an elf.   With that said, we're only talking about ""optimal"" characters from a skills perspective. If you want optimal karma amounts, see this post."

That meta type means you're putting skills, attributes, or Resources(if your game allows In Debt) at D, and Deckers want all of those high."

Deckers are the most prone ""class"" to having a bad roll (or their opponents having good ones) by the simple fact that every illegal thing (basically, everything) the decker does is on the clock. If the dice turn fickle, even for only a single roll, and the defender wins, they are immediately alerted to the hack in progress if the action taken against them was illegal. And then the decker is racing against two clocks. Better to avoid that in the first place, and 3 edge isn't enough of a cushion."

It works fine so long as you have the skills to supplement it which if it's not a pure rigger character you should be fine.
Shadowrun,3a0vot,Waldog1,5,Tue Jun 16 10:47:23 2015 UTC,"Waldog1 has it right. If you are only looking to control a single drone for support a commlink is all you need. If you want to be able to issue commands to a group of drones then you are going to be needing a RCC. Just make sure to be aware that issuing a command to a drone takes an action (can't remember whether it is simple or free), you may be able to come to an agreement with your GM about running preprogrammed routes/actions on your drone so that you are more free to act in combat."

There is no fuel so if it doesn't ignite anything immediately it goes away. Things that do get ignited are treated as normal fire thereafter, with a fuel it tends to stick around (doing dmg per turn) until it burns out or is put out.  Think like a can of hairspray(mana) and a lighter (mage) - in the air, you turn off the hairspray and the fire stops.

As for your buildings question, most buildings have a Structure+Armor rating that will be used for Barrier tests (a sort of combat test used for destroying buildings and obstacles). This rating is determined by the GM. Of course, anything that's cheaply made, not reinforced - and, of course, flammable - will probably go up without a Barrier test at the GM's discretion.

I would rule that after the ignite, it's an open fire - since none of your spell force remains to heat the flames, the fire's temp and potency depends on the natural fuel of the enemy/buildings body. That damage would be resisted with Body/Armor as usual.  You can melt all the steel beams you want, but they won't ignite and so fire won't spread from them. If you really want to burn down a steel building you'll need to maintain your spell until severe structural damage is incurred."

How about one that likes to get his victims strung out on drugs, and then drink their blood for double the fear and double the high!  Once you've got the type of vampire together, you have to ask how they fit into the gameworld. A High techy vampire is probably rich and likes to show it while your campy old school vampire probably has a hidden lair of opulent classical extravagance. Or maybe they're practically a squatter preying on the zoned out fragheads in the slums.  Once you've got your type and location the story starts to form itself. How do the players know about this? Do they come across them? Are they sent on a mission by someone? if they're sent on a mission then why does someone care enough to put out a hit on this guy? Did they kill someone they liked or maybe it's a matter of looking for a lost loved one who turns out to be a vamp?

You've woven a beautiful tapestry of the grand scale, the grand scheme, the world as a whole.    The players, though, are following just their single thread of their character.  They don't care that Amalgamated Conglomerate Partnership Incorporated just got bought out by BiggTymers LLC, strictly for the datafarm that they're going to liquidate, that some Johnson six months from now will hire the runners to infiltrate.   But you need to know the timelines on these, even if you make it up just before game time.  What to do?  My answer: be obvious.  Not ""hit with a wet fish in the face"" obvious, but clearly state it.  When characters ask for a description of the room, thing, news, whatever, give them the highlight list.  Make sure one thing in that list is a foreshadow item.  For example, in the above corp transaction, mention some poor researcher at the bar getting drunk.  Doesn't have to be interesting enough for the players to investigate immediately (because we all know players who latch on to random facts and suddenly you're chasing geese), but it does have to stand out from the gritty background.  Just enough that someone should remember it was there, even if they don't remember all the details."
Shadowrun,39y9hy,jWrex,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:50:44 2015 UTC,"This really cannot be stated enough.  What is obvious to you as GM is ancient egyptian hieroglyphs to the players.  What seems horribly obvious to you is crazily cryptic clues to the players.  Don't be obvious, be hella obvious."
Shadowrun,39y9hy,rejakor,2,Tue Jun 16 14:11:27 2015 UTC,"I just drop hints left right of things that they may or may not remember and see what sticks. At the beginning of the sessions, during breaks or during leg works, I ask what they remember and what they would like to do about the things they do remember. That way, I can developed things THEY find interesting.  If I really want to do foreshadowing of a run to come, I use the J. Location of the meet will have elements of where they'll be running. Like if they're going to be on a ship, a bar near the docks. If it involves traveling, probably an ethnically foreign J or an accent. If it involves a corp, mention subsidiaries relating to the job ahead, like a Wuxing J will mention a social media company that is doing well or is showing up in the news in the small talk before using that as a segway into the job to data steal from Horizon's commlink design he wants them to steal.  It's basically throwing a crap ton of darts and seeing what sticks."
Shadowrun,39y9hy,SmellyTofu,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"Weave tiny details into descriptions of other things.  Link things conceptually.  As the GM you have all the information, so it seems obvious to you that these things are linked, but to players it will be a sexy mystery (and go unnoticed until the denouement, and maybe even not then if you're too subtle about it).  I keep track of subplots by the way I keep track of everything, by creating characters with goals and tracking how those goals intersect in my head being interesting enough to keep my attention.  If it bores me, it'll bore the players.  The best hints are the ones generated organically by two clashing NPC plans dropping bits of tasty plot in player reach."

Shadowrun,39y9hy,PinkTrench,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"I had a good subplot when two of the players forgot to cover their faces during a mission to blow up a Bioware research facility (which actually turned out to be an HMHVV strain research lab, but they still blew it up.), and couple of the guards managed to record their faces with their commlinks and the video feed was all over the news. One of the anarchist groups took advantage of this and the leader of their group + his right hand started to pose as the two players caught on tape, and claimed that the attack was their doing. They committed crimes as player posers , and i told the players that they would gain notoriety + public awareness after each run if they would not deal with them. This made an epic run that took about 5 hours to complete, and it included loads of intense and hilarious moments.  like one of the players (who one of the anarchist leaders was posing as) actually took a selfie with one of the anarchist grunts before sticking an stun arrow to his neck  I would say that you should make them aware of some of the subplots that may effect their daily lives, and then keep some of the subplots hidden unless they find some clues during the runs or at their free time (someone is actually stalking them, Someone is about to betray them etc etc). You should also make some of the subplots personal."
Shadowrun,39y9hy,Cineic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:27:36 2015 UTC,"One thing I like doing is handouts at the start of a new session:  I'll often have news stories and/or social media chatter and/or forum posts (to jackpoint mainly) for them to see what kind of effect their missions have had on the world (which likely factors into the subplot anyway) but also to set up background info for later runs. The more subtle you want your hints,  the more red herring  articles you throw in (which might just turn into legit subplot hints down the line anyway)   So for example your team has a run where they just murder their way through everyone;  the next session might have a news articles about a terrorist massacre at their run's location, a tweet (or the shadowrun equivalent) about how horrible it is that such psychopaths are free in society and someone needs to do something,  and another tweet/police news statement/jackpoint post about lonestar's new magical forensic investigator. Additionally I might then throw in an article about multiple missing people or a hostile corporate takeover.    From that I have a couple of hooks about a new subplot where the team is being chased by an investigator,  a potential hook for a subplot involving a vigilante group or a beefed up neighbourhood watch, and a subplot hook for whatever on going campaign you had planned (either sinister kidnappings or a Corp looking to increase its influence/power)"
Shadowrun,39yza9,Viriathos,3,Mon Jun 15 22:50:47 2015 UTC,"It looks like he is trying to be a breaking and entering shaman. Can you post his choices at character creation as well as the character creation rules you decided on (street level, elite, etc)?  The following advice is given from the point of view of making as good a character as you can at creation (based on my opinions), he or she is always welcome to tone back the optimization as much as desired.   If it was my character: I would change my secondary roll to face (social character). You have the raw stats for it and can back it up in several ways magically.   I would drop, in order, agility, body, and reaction, and increase mental stats, especially logic (for the knowledge and b&e skills) and charisma (max out charisma specifically). Mental stats are important on the astral. Higher charisma for better everything, including drain dice (magic is this character's bread and butter).  I see no reason why this character has maximum agility other than a weapon. What are all those attack spells for if he is going to be amazing with guns? Which he isn't with only 2 ranks to use it. 5 agility is plenty for almost any mage (depending on what your secondary role of course). Enhance the weapon with some mods as soon as you can afford it. smartlink and custom grip (in that order) will make you better.   Just add a specialization to the weapon skill for the gun of choice and now he has 4 ranks when he shoots it. His dice pool has not changed from the character sheet but he has saved 2 more attribute points.  As to the breaking and entering skills: 5 agility and the right tools will do plenty for you (they give you bonuses). You are missing the hardware skill if you plan on being a B&E (for those moments when all else fails and you need to crack the side open to mess with the wires/circuits). Also see my comments on spells below to further enhance this. Grab as many tools at the highest rating as you can as many give you direct bonuses to the roll. Even with just 1 rank in locksmith and a 4+ logic, with an r6 tool you can boost up to double digits.   For other agility skills like sneaking and gymnastics, 5 agility is plenty as well. Add a specialization to sneaking to the area you will be playing in most commonly (Seattle based campaign would be urban).   If you are going to grab sneaking and palming, you might as well grab the stealth group so you get disguise as well, which is a fantastic skill for any runner to have. You don't want people to recognize you, and the skill stacks with itself if you have a disguise kit and the time to make prostethics (read the proper entries in the corebook for the details). At character creation, it is usually best to spend skill group points towards useful secondary stuff, like the stealth group.  A rating 1 fakeSIN is chicken DNA with the name of John Doe or Jane Smith on it. To move around freely in all of Seattle you should have a R4 fakeSIN. The fake license's rating must be the same as the SIN it is attached to.  Coffee is a weak addiction (as well as cigarettes, alcohol, etc) for the setting. Many, if not most, are addicted to most or all of those without writing it on the sheet. If you don't mind Coffee as an addiction, I would make sure only the real stuff counts, not soykaf or krillchillers. Make him pay for it in nuyen until he spends the money on a lifestyle that can maintain real coffee on a regular basis at home, which I believe is high iirc.  Increase perception, specialize in something (most commonly visual). If you don't see the threat, you will be killed before you can do something.  Why all the running ranks? I have never put a single rank in running, it has never been a problem. Especially considering how much agility this character has. Even at 5 agility, you have a huge amount of movement, so I don't know the logic here.   Drop the banishing ranks to 1 if you need them for thematic reasons, dump the rest into counterspelling. You are the team's magical defense and you cannot do that if you don't have any ranks in counterspelling. Put as many as you can spare here for that matter, because when you use spell defense (the most common action with this skill) you do not actually roll it (that is used for the act of dispelling), you grant all selected targets (up to your casting stat worth of targets, iirc) your ranks as a bonus to whatever spell defense rolls they make. Note that you decide how those are split up. I.e.; a control thoughts spell comes in, you say ""everyone gets 2 extra dice, I am saving the other 2 for another spell"". The skill replenishes when you use the spell defense action again (a free action, or interrupt action @ -5 initiative).   SPELLCASTING! I take it back, as he stands he did need those pistol ranks. How are you a mage without the ability to cast spells? Max this out asap. Same with Summoning skill. If you can afford to specialize after maxing it out, grab the most common one you will use.   He also has no ranks in assensing. He can see into the astral, he can go into the astral, but he has no clue what he is seeing at any time, ever. Not only is he missing out on an amazing ability, but if he decides to go face, it is doubly so, allowing you to read people's emotions as you use your social skills on them. Also, and probably the most important part, if you cannot assense, you cannot clean your astral signature. You will be in jail or under a corporate boot right after a big enough job that sends in forensics to check it out.  Spells: 3 spells that no mage should ever be missing. Improved Invisibility, Physical Barrier, Increase Reflexes. Many would add Heal to that list as well.   Improved invisibility stops cameras and people from seeing you (you still need to be sneaky, and stacks with your catlike quality). Physical barrier allows you to create walls out of thin air, so useful. Rat followers have plenty of uses for this to avoid confrontation and to get away if somehow seen.   Increase Reflexes is probably the most important, since it lets you be as fast as everyone else (dirty trick: at the beginning of the session, cast a force 2 with 10 drams of reagents, use edge to reroll failures if you didn't get enough hits on the first roll, hold for the rest of the game. keep in mind your signature and where you leave it).  Heal recovers boxes of physical (not stun) damage. Note that damage from drain or Technomancer's fading cannot be healed by this spell (or a medkit for that matter). Only the medicine skill and time can help with those.  If you wish to stick to the B&E, you pretty much have to grab Analyze device. This amazing spell (for anyone really) turns you into an instant master of whatever you touch (provided you roll well and the gm rolls crappy on the object resistance test, so the more technological the device, its potentially harder to analyze). It eliminates defaulting penalties (which means you can spend edge on the roll), as well give you a bonus to any roll you make with the device analized. Analyze your sequencer, break the maglock. Analyze your hardware kit, open the machine successfully. Need to get away and the driver is passed out dying, analyze the car and take the wheel. If it's a tool, you can analyze it and grant yourself a bonus. Do it to your commlink and enhance your matrix search dice.   If you plan on sneaking around, the shapechange spell is fantastic. You want to keep your body specifically at 3 to be able to exploit this as much as possible. Later on you grab an Enhance Body spell, or carry some drugs, to temporarily increase your body so you can shape change into larger stuff if you desire.  Subpar choices: Analyze magic, Detect Life, Shatter, and Flamethrower/lightning bolt. Assensing covers many if not most of everything you can learn with both Analyze magic and Detect life, so they are redundant 9 times out of 10 if you can assense.   Shatter is just bad: it's touch range (rat follower would never get this close to anyone if they can avoid it), and you already have several methods of dealing physical damage (including your gun and all the different ammo choices you have. Look into capsule rounds, dmso, and all the chems you want for a whole new world of ammo).   You only need one spell between flamethrower and lightning bolt at character creation. I would recommend lightning bolt since electricity damage has the added benefit of lowering initiative and that is a very big deal in this game. Also if you want to start a fire, just lightning bolt something flammable.    Look into fetishes, they are great for certain spells.   As soon as possible, he should consider getting a power foci to assist with almost everything he does magically. Sustaining foci are also very useful. Be careful how many you use at the same time so you don't become addicted.   My armor of choice for this character (especially if you sub face): Berwick suit with an Argentum Coat (cast Analyze device on the suit or coat, grant yourself bonuses to social skills). If you stick to b&e, then grab a chameleon suit asap.   Until you can afford to levitate, gekko gloves are the mundane's flying. Make sure you plug all your holes with tech and mundane stuff, you can't do it all with magic, and sometimes, it is not a good idea to do it with magic.   Definitely look into the drug called Psyche. Not only does it give you some nice social bonuses, but it has a unique power: it lowers all penalties for sustaining spells for -2 to -1. That means you can cast and sustain 2 or 3 spells and still be functional most of the time rather than just holding your head against a wall unable to function at -4 or -6 dice to all your rolls (except drain and soak).  I hope this helps. There is plenty more information, but that is all I can muster for the moment."
Shadowrun,39yza9,motionmatrix,2,Tue Jun 16 02:23:12 2015 UTC,"Generally I would go Flamethrower or Lightning Bolt, never both. If he absolutely wants to use that spell as a combat spell, I would suggest either an AOE, or a Direct spell, something that you would use in a different situation than the other two.  I get that Mages are poor, but a R2 SIN is probably the minimum. R1s can be used to order pizza or get a cab, but the worst scanner in the world (like the ones in streetlights) have about a 60% chance of seeing something wrong with the R1. The R2 won't let you pass security, but can let you do business in B and lower neighborhoods fine.  He has no rating in Spellcasting. While having a Spirit of Man cast for you is a valid strategy, one rank in spellcasting would let him actually use all those spells he has, even if poorly.  Shatter is probably worse than Punch. Target restriction, and stun and phys damage do the same thing to structures(I may be wrong here, not sure)."

That way chance plays a big part, the bigger dice pool is more likely to win, but we've all rolled dice; sometimes big pools fail and small pools roll 6's :)  Also, what do you want your players to get out of it? If you want to let them try to game the system to make some big bucks but maybe have to deal with some angry security, then go for that! If you want to offer them some flavour that won't be game breaking, then limit the size of the bets and insinuate that the bookie suspects the player of cheating if they push for bigger bets.

Shadowrun,39yo77,zombieChan,2,Tue Jun 16 21:53:48 2015 UTC,Dragonfall directors cut is put together much better then Dead Man's Switch. Dragonfall has a slightly better sandbox feel along with plot for all of your regular team members. By far the better game.  Dead man's switch is a fun game and if your interested in Shadowrun lore and Seattle as the setting it's worth it for that. It also has a number of throwbacks to the superNES game which if you played that it's a treat.

But be aware, if you apply this to NPCs you have to do the same to your PCs. It becomes insanely deadly at that point, in a way that your players should prepare backup characters in advance because they will drop like flies. Shadowrun tries to strike a balance between a statisfying gameplay thats fun to use and realism, going for a lot more realism often creates frustrating gameplay."
Shadowrun,39smpn,iForkyou,3,Sun Jun 14 11:23:19 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your second point at all.  Slow people are slow. Strong people can sprint better. Sometimes those two groups overlap. What's the issue?  If you want to be quick with Agility 2, you're gonna have a bad time."
Shadowrun,39smpn,PinkTrench,4,Sun Jun 14 14:37:18 2015 UTC,"1) It's a game mechanic. If you want -4 dice pool to instagib that's your call, if you consider actually aiming elsewhere than centermass to be realistic in the first place. (Also, you'd be surprised at hiw often people survived headshots and how often people die from say, shot in the leg, or anywhere else really)  2) I don't think a ""cyberarm shootist"" to be a good athlete. Mechanically, every 2 success on a sprint test = 1AGI unless you're a dwarf or troll. A skilled runner with multiple initiative passes will easily outpace an untrained person. Exemple, let's take a naturally extremely fast elf with no training vs. a very average sporty ork. (Ex: AGI7 STR3 elf hacker with no athletics will run 28m in a combat turn and have sprint with two dice per initiative pass for a few extra meters, and take fatigue damage quickly. Compare this to a sporty ork with 1 point over the average (AGI4 STR6, Running 6, specialised in sprinting, [not even going to give him Natural Athlete, synthcardium or any other benefit]). The ork will start the turn with 16 meters +2 per hit.  Let's assume they both have just 2 initiative passes, another advantage to the elf. The elf will roll ((3-1)x2) 4 dice, for an average of 1 hit (and if he rolls only one ""1"" he glitches, critically if he doesn't get a hit). 30 meters total. The ork will roll ((5+6+2)x2) 26 dice, that's a statistical average of 8 hits, or 16m. In 3 seconds the elf ran 30m and the ork ran a 32m. Pretty reasonable, considering the elf is the pinnacle of metahumanity, and he still lost."
Shadowrun,39smpn,Sebbychou,2,Sun Jun 14 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"If a character uses a rifle and hits somebody in the head, that someone should be dead, if he is not wearing a very good helmet   There aren't any called shots to the head in the core book. Have you tried going through Run & Gun? It has rules for shooting various body parts or otherwise using ammo to hurt people in new ways.  If that's not an option, then I recommend using relative called shots. (based on the damage result, rather than forming intent when declaring the action)   In our group this translates into the least sportive character of our group having the greatest basic movement range   Try the 4e movement rules; see if they work for you.  Metatype Walking / Running (meters/turn)  Humans, Elves, Orks 10 / 25  Dwarfs 8 / 20  Trolls 15 / 35  Sprinting adds +2m/hit."
Shadowrun,39smpn,BitRunr,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:22:57 2015 UTC,"On the topic of aimed shots I usually take much from the number of hits, after all this is the goon's only chance to dodge the shot.  If it was a truly successful aimed shot to the head of a goon with no helmet, I'll usually just allow that the target was neutralized.  Fewer hits and the damage done might be a grazed ear, though I don't give a body+armor roll for the goon's head (just a beefy body roll, why would he need more than a three or six dice pool to defend a shot to the head..how does one even resist such damage).  Essentially, those enemies should be wearing helmets or face the inevitable aimed shot.  With enough hits over their opponent, I think it makes sense that they go down.  Play it on your GM instinct."
Shadowrun,39smpn,thisbecharlie,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:20:14 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with called shots: vitals, because its an abstraction. How much damage your shot does determines where it landed.  Say we use a crappy gun like the Streamline Special. We get 4 hits to shoot after our called shot, and they get 2 hits to dodge. We get 2 net hits. Damage is now 6 (base damage) + 2 (net hits) + 2 (called shot) = 10 DV. Say, they get 3 hits on their soak test, they take 7P. They have 10 boxes, so that's over half their boxes. They're knocked down. You hit this guy pretty hard, he's taking -2 to all actions, if we were playing with the SR4 optional severe wounds rules (which I am hoping makes a comeback in Chrome Flesh) this guy would also have a damaged organ and need medial attention pretty quickly. You probably didn't shoot him in the head, but in the stomach or lung or somewhere else you don't want bullets to be.  I also don't have a problem with movement rates, as much, because some people are good at sprinting, people with high STR and running skill, while others are long distance runners like those with high AGI."
Shadowrun,39smpn,dethstrobe,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"My group has Aimed Bursts and Spray Bursts (as well as Aimed Autofire and Spray Autofire).  Spray Bursts and Spray Autofire follow the RAW, meaning they penalize your opponent's defense test, but leave the damage unmodified.  Semi Auto Spray Bursts are -1, Short Spray Bursts are -2, Long Spray Bursts are -5, and Spray Autofire is -9 to the defender's tests.  Aimed Bursts and Aimed Autofire use those same numbers, but add to damage INSTEAD of subtracting from Defense Test.  A Semi Auto Aimed Burst does +1DV, a Short Aimed Burst does +2 DV, a Long Aimed Burst does +5DV, and Aimed Autofire does +9DV.  This makes combat WAY more deadly at my table, and it makes characters who can control their autofire EXTREMELY combat effective.  As for the movement, I don't quite see the issue you're running into.  If your Street Samurai have low Agility, then they'll be naturally slower, but Cyberware does absolutely boost Agility.  The base Muscle Augmentation Cyberware is +1 Strength and Agility per point.  I've rarely seen an Augmented Street Sam with an Agility under 4, which should be higher than most humans as the average is 3.  They get the added benefit of having bonus strength for their Sprinting tests.  In the end, it works out.  Do you mind sharing your characters?  What Agility do these people have that they're colossally slow?"
Shadowrun,39smpn,CrimsonLoyalty,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:31:57 2015 UTC,"aimed shots   This whoel section will depend on how much more incredibly lethal you want the game to be. Remember that npcs should also be able to head shot your pcs. See how much they cry about that.   Movement range.   Your fighters, ""built wrong"" mechanically cyberarms are incredibly inefficent.   We all think, this is somewhat stupid    Just because someone bought shiny fancy arms, and never worked out, or ate right or anything along those lines. Why would their meat agility go up because of arms? Are they running on their hands.  Your fighters are not fit people. They have used technology as a shortcut to greatness.  It makes perfects sense that they would be slow in comparison to someone who spent time and effort to improve his meat instead of just buying tech for it."
Shadowrun,39smpn,Bamce,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:13:06 2015 UTC,"The entire game system is balanced around the assumption that armor is an abstraction and that there are no hitzones. If you change that, the system breaks down very quickly.  Mathematically, a vitals shot is a good deal. You trade 4 dice for 2 DV which is roughly equal to 6 dice of the defender's soak pool. If the same penalty removed the entire body armor, you are on average (12 armor) doubling and sometimes trippling and quadrupling the value of a called shot. Odds are, pretty soon called shots will be all people ever do.   You are absolutely right that it makes zero sense realistically speaking, but that's why there is no such thing as a headshot in the first place. In our game, we've solved the problem by determining where someone gets hit after the shot was made and soaked. To us, a head shot isn't a called shot, it's when someone causes enough damage to immediately drop an enemy."

Another two years pass. California leaves UCAS. Gets attacked by Atzlan from the south and Tir Tairngire from the north. CalFree in it's hour of need turns to Japan for aid. Japan takes over California to save it from it's attackers after a bitter struggle.  The Japanese Imperial State gives Zurich-Orbital it's national currency the yen. The nuyen becomes usable internationally. Later that month Lofwyr takes over Saeder Krupp in a shock move.  The next month, SINs are introduced in UCAS. Fuchi also produces the first real cyberdeck, it's about the size of an old desktop computer.  As the year comes to a close the second Eurowars start...

Shadowrun,39qxa4,Valanthos,2,Sun Jun 14 03:00:13 2015 UTC,I don't think Lofwyr was ever involved in leadership/establishment of Tir Tairngaire. The immortal elves and he are major enemies of each other.

It was called Operation RECIPROCITY, it was a military operation that took place in Enseñada, Aztlan, in 2048, it was a warning to Aztlan to stop nationalizing assets in their territory and then rebranding them as Aztechnology and putting them for sale.  The other seven megacorps of the time formed the ""Pan-Corporate Security Comittee"" and started to plan an attack, the Comittee decided to attack Enseñada because most of the assets on the base were Aztechnology corporate forces and not Aztlan military  This is the stuff I could remember but there's a lot more information on the wiki page"

Shadowrun,39rdag,Trickybiz,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:05:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, Corporate gear laws tend to be more lenient than national laws.  Ares might allow fully automatic weapons whereas both CAS and UCAS have those as restricted.  Generally speaking, if you need to take your corporate weapon off corporate property for corporate uses, the corporation pays for those permits.  The more likely case is that the corporation has a security company license with the associated liability insurance and documentation.  The employees of that company employ weapons per the legally reviewed charter.  This is not the same as privately owning a weapon.  That being said, corporate SINs and permits do tend to allow for better interregional transportation since you can generally go from corporate territory to corporate territory without much incident.  Once at your destination, it is just a matter of getting your gear off corporate property.    Anyway, the OP is leaving due to bad blood with the Vory and some Asian group.

Shadowrun,39pm01,DankDakka,4,Sat Jun 13 14:56:21 2015 UTC,"Ultra-Glide Industrial Lubricant (liter)   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  In all seriousness, it looks like a fairly solid character.  Some people would scoff at you not having 15+ dice in any one pool, but really 10 or higher is exceptionally proficient when you consider 3s and 4s to be average for the rank and file of the world.  Considering you get 11s and 12s with many of the important things, you're doing alright.  One thing that strikes me as off though is you have the AR gloves, the contacts with the image link, the earbuds, the subvocal mic, the trodes, but no commlink.  As far as I'm aware, this is the equivalent to having a 3D capable monitor, speakers, high end studio microphone, custom Power Gloves, and that weird thought control mouse system, but no computer to hook them all up to in order to go online.  Even a simple meta link (100¥) would be enough.  >)  As an aside, the trodes basically do the job of all of the other things by virtue of being a direct neural interface (DNI).  That means that you've got all the aural, visual, tactile, and potentially taste and scent interfacing done without the need to have the rest.  So you can possibly clear those things away unless you have a pressing need to not use your trodes often.  Depending on the GM they can allow the trodes to work in a ""passive AR"" mode which is equivalent to the interfacing of the various items together without actually being in AR mode.    Stats aside, I'm also a fan of the prejudice as well as the writing it into your background as to why you hate that particular class of people.  I know far too many people who don't take the time to write even a simple two sentence background for their characters, and it's refreshing to see a substantial connection with both your tradition and your family come up in it which is driving your character's direction now."

(Maybe stuff a few other vision mods into the glasses, if I've got extra funds.)  This way, the eyes get to see more, and you can remove the glasses to avoid AR issues, not look like you're actively looking for a fight, and confuse those who might wish you harm.  (Then again, I wear glasses, so maybe that colors my perception of what you can do with them...)"
Shadowrun,39pm01,marwynn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit squeamish myself about putting things on my eyes, so contacts are usually out, myself.  I can see how they're more subtle, but glasses or goggles are my preferred way of interacting with any mods.  Flare compensation is just tintable glasses which we have in today's day and age that tint in response to light, so nothing out of the ordinary (to casual observance) there.  Image links depends if it's an eyetap type device or a reflection device, but we have the means to project an image off of a small reflective surface into the eyes, so it's entirely possible that an image link in the 2070s is a sort of prism like array almost imperceptible to the naked eye that reflect peripheral light into the eye directly to display pictures (like from the rims of the glasses, as per an LCD display)."
Shadowrun,39pm01,marwynn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:48:52 2015 UTC,"Solid character. I can't offer any true criticisms, but perhaps some advice?  I don't see Assensing anywhere. Am I going blind? You'll want a point in that at least, and also one in Arcana.   Body 3 will give you an extra Physical box. That's a matter of life and death, meanwhile having Strength 3 isn't. Also, Reaction + Intuition are combined for defense these days. You can lower Reaction to 2 and move that point over to Intuition, it'll boost a few of your skills like Perception.  Your initiative's very low, so you're going to have to be pretty smart in using your loa's services. An average roll on your sole initiative die will only give you one phase to act. So I suggest giving a command before battle even begins. But since Vodou's a possession tradition, independent action for the spirit's going to be difficult. Not impossible though.  You have Improved Reflexes but I don't see a way for you to sustain that without penalty. You'll want either a Rating 2 Health Sustaining Focus for just 1 extra die, but that's expensive, or the Focused Concentration Quality.  I would also suggest relocating a few points from Ritual Spellcasting to Counterspelling. 3 is not enough, even with a specialization.  Be careful with Mind Probe. People will know their minds have been probed, and they're not going to like that one bit. As an alternative to Agony, take a look at Foreboding. It's LOS(A) so you can magically ""suppress"" some people.   If you free up 10 Karma, I think you can get more Negative qualities, you can get 2 more spells. One I'd suggest would be an Indirect Combat Spell, say Clout or Fireball. Direct Combat Spells aren't the greatest in this edition. Also, Magic Fingers might prove very useful.   All in all, it's a solid Magician."

I'm not dropping a CZ on the players because theyre too good, if I wanted to really challenge em, opposing shadowrunner teams do that really well, as well as well thought out engagements. the CZ is actually a character who first hired the oldest runner of the group, and someone the runner saw as a friend, who ALSO made them a shitton of money and got them into shadowrunning from living off the street. He was presumed dead after the Johnson(CZ in question) pissed off his parent corp by having the shadowrunners hit his own company (Long story short he was committing seppuku via action). The Johnsons son, who hated his father, joined up with the triads and has thrown Seattle into chaos (even LONGER story) and has made his father into a CZ using Triad funds. The plan is to do the reveal to the player in question and have the CZ backed up by a rigger/technomancer/hacker extraordinaire who is gonna be controlling several heavy weapons mounted drones. Also a lesser Asian Dragon. I can do the techno/hacker/rigger and the dragon is obv., but I want the CZ to be a pretty huge thing too."

This needs a tactical simulation : YOU DON'T WANT TO SHRED THEM !  4) Pay attention not to mop up the group unintentionally  5) Be ready to deal with the consequences of a botched run, don't try it in a arch plot sensitive scenario or run it at a time they are supposed to fail   6) The cyber zombie IS NOT THE ENEMY, there's a handler behind it, and he will be pissed !"
Shadowrun,39o97w,Jegeva,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:28:53 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong but a cyberzombie wouldn't necessarily need to be a PC-killing badass. You COULD kit one out really well, or you could make a basic augment with a lower threat level.  I wouldn't lock one down as a game-changing, serious threat in any case. Sure, you want to reflect that a zombie is a million-NY investment, but that doesn't mean it'll be deployed well and/or completely unexpected. Good runners always have a good chance of knowing what's coming, and if they make the right checks beforehand it would be boorish to say, ""Well you didn't detect any cyberware or auras but this guy came out of nowhere.""  I think it's important to remember that the GM is not, principally speaking, the players' boss or their enemy. He's their storyteller. There should be no question of punishing players, except in the sense that if they let their guard down they should get hit. Strategic goals for a fight should boil down to two or three story-related outcomes, not specific damage. It's fine to make the c-zombie itself go for limbs/whatever as its target, but expect runners to compensate for this. And never try to make sure the fight is incredibly damaging, because the game will fuck you. Our boss baddies on our last run (street level) were a pair of trolls that way outstatted us. Our decker/sniper rolled great initiative and combat and pulled off a kill in the first turn.  As for the handler, if his cyberzombie(s) is/are that badass, he's probably not going to be much of a threat himself. You don't want an anticlimax, per se, but you've got to be realistic."
Shadowrun,39n5wa,Zemalac,8,Fri Jun 12 22:53:04 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest advising on the Rain Forest Carbine based off the Missions FAQ errata to it, rather than the pdf stats."
Shadowrun,39n5wa,BitRunr,6,Fri Jun 12 23:00:49 2015 UTC,"You forgot to mention the Raiden cannot semi-auto The XMR has the advantage of needing modifications only once (gas vents, etc.) and share ammunition between the types. It's a logistically sound weapon. I can't find where it says it uses different skills. The monsoon, having multiple ammo source, can have multiple ammo types loaded in. That's a huge advantage on drones, in exchange of the typical 250 ammo modification. as /u/BitRunr said, the Carbine was typo'd in the book. The actual stats are at the end of the book and in the errata. It's a actually kinda crap. I totally agree on the streetline special. A streetline special with flechette ammo using the Bleed Out called shot can be a nasty lethal surprise to anyone. The Cavalier revolver is SA. That's the main difference with the Warhawk. About the Violator, the safe system and everything isn't useless, and has the advantage of coming with it and a smartlink with neithet taking internal slots. It's nothing to write home about, but... It's still unique like that. Absolutely agree on the Auto-Assault 16. That thing is a beast. The sheer amount of undodgable damage this thing does with Flechette is ridiculous.   Edit:  I forgot to mention that the guns with high power but terrible accuracy are good on drones, since Gunnery uses your sensor rating as a limit rather than the actual accuracy. Same thing with ammo capacity, where drones can have 250 o pretty much any weapon. Sometime a terrible gun has a silver lining.  Edit 2:  You mention putting smartlinks on Legal weapons to make efficient legal weapons. Just a reminder that smartlinks themselves are Restricted, and may not be legal or acceptable ""sporting"" equipment. YMMV."
Shadowrun,39n5wa,Sebbychou,6,Sat Jun 13 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"A number of very good points. Responding to some of them:   I was just assuming that the XMR sniper and LMG variants used the skills that those weapons usually used. If they actually use automatics, then that's a much better weapon. I hadn't noticed that about the Violator. Doesn't make me like it any better, but...huh. I did mention in some of the shittier guns that they could be good on a drone. The SBd-44, for example. I've been assuming that smartlinks are legal (if restricted) on hunting rifles because they pretty much exist in real life for that purpose already. I figure a hunting license covers the rifle and the smartlink on it."
Shadowrun,39n5wa,Haroshia,2,Sat Jun 13 02:48:27 2015 UTC,The Cavalier revolver is SA. That's the main difference with the Warhawk.   Yep.  That's why it's the better revolver choice for the discerning Gunslinger Adept.
Shadowrun,39n5wa,TaeoG,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:04:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like just taking two Warhawks would be better than a Deputy. All SA buys you is semi-auto burst, which you'll not get much use out of with only seven rounds in the cylinder. Bulls-Eye Double-Tap is useful, I suppose, but that only gives a multiplier to the base AP of the gun, which is low in the Cavalier's case."

Shadowrun,39n5wa,AMARDA1,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:12:28 2015 UTC,My biggest issue with the original statblock is actually availability 5R. That means that as a GM I'd be fully justified having that thing appear in the hands of many Sec.  Which I'd do if some group wanted to argue me into allowing it's existence. I'm of the school of thought that banning gear from existence means NPCs don't get it too. In any event I doubt any shadowrunner wants to be faced with the prospect of the (wrong stat block) rain forest being a commonly issued security item.
Shadowrun,39n5wa,RussellZee,0,Sun Jun 14 02:31:11 2015 UTC,"Well anyway, the point is that the errata made the gun in line with the rest of the game rather than the stupid OP monster it seemed to be.  (I thought I recalled that it had two different 5th stats within the book itself as well)"

Shadowrun,39n5wa,dethstrobe,3,Sat Jun 13 13:03:24 2015 UTC,I think an important advantage the raiden has over the alpha is it's internal silencer. While with the Alpha you have to choose between a gas vent or a silencer you can have both for the raiden. Of course the grenade launcher already shifts the alpha to the loud side of spectrum but for teams who plan on taking out security without alerting more a raiden could be preferable.

Shadowrun,39n5wa,CitizenJoseph,3,Sat Jun 13 02:49:11 2015 UTC,An additional point of damage and an additional point of accuracy. I think it's the accuracy that makes most of the price difference--they seem to assign a lot of weight to that when determining costs.

Also, how would you say the stakeout-sized T-250 stacks up against the Roomsweeper? I'm looking at the 5E corebook and the stakeout T-250 looks like it's slightly inferior to the Roomsweeper, aside from the pump-action for those paranoid of jams."
Shadowrun,39n5wa,Thanes_of_Danes,3,Sat Jun 13 03:42:46 2015 UTC,"The sawed-off T-250 is 9P AP -1 with slugs, while the Roomsweeper is 7P AP -1. The Roomsweeper has more ammo capacity, but overall, gotta give it to the Defiance.  That said, you can hide a Roomsweeper a lot easier than even a sawed-off T-250, so you're more likely to be able to have it with you.

Shadowrun,39n5wa,WizardWolf,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:04:30 2015 UTC,"The Alpha is a bullpup configuration which means longer barrel for a given length overall.  That means getting better use out of the propellant which translates into more damage.  That special chamber design is a floating barrel system that you see on some sniper rifles.  Great for recoil but lousy for durabilty, i.e. don't even think about rifle butting someone with it.  I believe the Beta was ruggedized for melee combat.  Assault rifles generally use 5-6 mm rounds.  Battle rifles generally use 7-9 mm rounds and have less magazine capacity for that reason.  Snipers typically use th 7-9 mm range with heavy snipers in the 12-13mm round."

Shadowrun,39nkjn,lshiva,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:56:45 2015 UTC,that is possible. They could have just said that all its attributes were equal to its force and that would have said it all because its astral physical attributes would be equal to its mental attributes which are the same as its normal physical attributes. Maybe they just made it confusing by phrasing it in an overly convoluted way.

If the character is injured on a corp's extraterritorial property, DocWagon can't come in without permission, so you're probably boned, unless your decker can somehow pull off some magic and convince their security that DocWagon is allowed in, or your face can run some kinda con, etc. If the character is injured on public property and the police and docwagon show up at the same time, I'm sure the police would at least allow docwagon to perform immediate on-site medical care.  At that point, it's going to depend on who wants you more.  Do you have a high-end contract with DocWagon?  Do the police want you badly enough to tangle with a DocWagon HTR team?  The RAW is pretty vague here, so it's GM's call.   DocWagon clinics are probably extraterritorial, so if they do pull your butt out of the fire, you're probably safe from the local police at least for the moment."

Shadowrun,39mnww,Sebbychou,2,Wed Jun 17 13:21:10 2015 UTC,"Let's start with technical aspect:   Banishing free spirits (and why it's kind of useless) is in SG p.204 (it also explain a danger of adding free spirits if a player knows the advanced binding rules... A free spirit can be enslaved rather easily if your assensing is high enough) Banishing Resistance is on SG p.194   For the Force rating of free spirits, I either decide on how smart I want it to be (Force=Mental stats, so you can't put a powerful spirit abd expect it to be an idiot) or follow this rule here on p.202 under ""Born Free"". A spirit has an edge rating equal to it's Force/2 (which then turns to a rating of 1 after freebirth). This assume that the spirit became free the most common way: A mage lost control of his Spirit (probably happened at death). I assume this is a spirit that wishes to be free so he'd edge the test.   A spirit needs 3 hit on a Edge test. This means for statistical success, a spirit need 9 dice. The minimums for these would be...    Force 6 bound spirit that spent memorable time among metahumanity using edge to reroll failed dice rolls could semi-reliably get 3 hits  Force 7 bound spirit that spent memorable time among metahuminty edging the test would have (((4-1)+4+2) 9 dice  Force 13 unbound spirit edging has 10 dice  Any spirit could Smackdown to succeed the test... Mechanically it doesn't affect anything for them since they get a flat 1 edge after breaking free anyway. Need some plot-power to do that though.    Alternatively, without edging, the weakest a spirit could be if lucky and having 3 successes on three dice...    Force 1 bound spirit that spent memorable time with humanity would have 3 dice. Considering it would have LOG1, INT1 and CHA1, you can assume it would be a really shitty, unpleasant, dumb ghost worse than Slimer.  Force 6 Bound spirit  Force 13 unbound spirit would have 3 dice. (Exemple, a spirit whisperer tried summoning a Force12(+1) spirit in a dire situation, the drain killed him outright but the spirit came... And stayed)   I hope this helped!"
Shadowrun,39mnww,Sebbychou,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"The Free Spirit is a ""Perfect Form"" (aka semi-naturally occurring) of an uncommon Paranormal Critter native to the area, so I thought its Perfect Form Free Spirit would be mid-range power and wouldn't probably Edge tests unless the PCs were particularly cruel to the Manticores of the area (which they weren't).  I started combat with the Spirit's Force set at 12, but after it dodged 2 Indirect Combat spells without even trying I realized that I needed to tone it down. Because it still could have conceivably dodged them if it was Force 9 that's what I ended up going with.  Around the middle of the first turn my two shamans decided to team up (with a Force 6 Air Spirit they had) and try to Banish the Manticore spirit.  Since the game's Banishing rules want the number of services I used Force instead. It rolled Force(9) and got 5 hits (insanely good roll). I let them do an impromptu ritual (they both only had Banishing at rating 1). I thought it was only appropriate for them to try something non-standard since both of their characters have never banished a spirit before. The Owl Shaman started the Banishing with 9 dice (6 Magic + 1 Banishing + 2 Owl bonus) and I added 6 dice (Magic rating) for the Coyote Shaman helping and 6 dice (Force) for the Air Spirit helping for a total of 21 dice. They spent Edge to reroll 3 failed dice twice and ended up with 9 total hits.  I ruled that the Force of the Spirit was reduced by 4 (from 9) down to 5 (which I realize now wouldn't be the way I should normally go about that). Once they had it weakened it started to dematerialize and the Coyote Shaman Lightning Bolted it for 14P (Edged).  So, obviously I needed to give it an Edge rating and reduced its Edge rather than its Force. Can a friendly Spirit (or Ally) assist on Banishing or only Spellcasting?  I feel like I did a bunch of stuff really wrong, but my players loved it and they didn't know any of the underlying mechanics any more than I did. So, next time it can be more RAW and it shouldn't be hard to explain to them what has changed.  You have been so helpful, thanks!"

Aid Sorcery/Study is a very specific service that only allows to help what is clearly defined in the service description in the rulebook. Other than this spirits are limited to normal teamwork tests in skills they know. Ally and Free spirits can't learn conjuring skills and normal summoned spirits are limited to the skills and powers available to them and none of them includes conjuring."
Shadowrun,39ktli,AustralianWinter,14,Fri Jun 12 12:46:12 2015 UTC,"I want to say that the whole point of cloned body parts is to not lose essence.  Since it takes months to grow and you can't regrow essence just have a hole that can be filled, I would say you don't lose essence until you accept the replacement."
Shadowrun,39ktli,CitizenJoseph,11,Fri Jun 12 13:14:46 2015 UTC,"No rule I've ever seen had trauma / amputation causing essence loss.  Medical transplants that simply repair damage using cloned tissue without augmented performance also do not.  However, these events (in editions I played) could cause magic loss.  There's all kinds of half baked fluff theories about essence, but in the end it's just a game mechanic to limit augmention via implants and especially dual use of implants and magic, and loosely used in a few other contexts."
Shadowrun,39ktli,sebwiers,9,Fri Jun 12 13:54:34 2015 UTC,"I believe this was officially touched on in one of the earlier editions, I'm thinking either the 2e or 3e core or perhaps Man and Machine (3e).  I don't have my books available to me.  But it much of what other people here have said.  Losing a limb/injury does not cause essence loss.  The installation of something foreign into your body does."
Shadowrun,39ktli,leminex,11,Fri Jun 12 14:03:31 2015 UTC,"Here we go, Man and Machine page 6, the section developers say  ""We need to really define what Essence loss represents, but it's never been fully explained.  For example, does a person lose Essence when they lose a limb, or have a pin pu t in to fuse a bone, or even implant a pacemaker?  How about when they transplant a liver, or in Shadowrun, a cloned body part?  None of those things have ever been described in terms of Essence.  We do know you can lose Essence when you take a deadly wound, receive incompetent medical care or suffer an addiction.  We also know that adding cyberware immediately removes Essence and that different grades of cyberware remove different amounts of Essence. So our first distinction is that Essence loss doesn't happen just because a person is cut open or something is damaged and needs to be removed.  Nor is it lost when something the body already has is replaced with the samet ype of item (liver for liver, lung for lung, flesh limb for flesh limb).  This limits Essence loss to something that happens when foreign elements are implanted in the body.  But again, this sweeping statement fails because pins, hip replacements and pacemakers shouldn't cause you to lose Essence.  So what is it about cyberware that causes Essence loss?  Cybeerware needs to be implanted and connected to the neuropathways, unlike pins and pacemakers, which have no need to talk to the brain.  So the unique thing about cyberware is that it's a non-natural implant that talks to the brain.  So this machine--metal, ceramic, polymers and other future-tech stuff--must be connected to the ol' fleshy gray matter.  This is how cyberware differs from all other implants and it is here that Essence is lost.""   Now some of this doesn't hold up as bioware again causes Essence loss (in 3e, it was different).  Also you do have cyberware that doesn't interact with the neurosystem that causes essence loss (hidden body compartments), so it's not a perfect explanation."
Shadowrun,39ktli,leminex,8,Fri Jun 12 15:19:51 2015 UTC,"I'd say essence loss comes into play the moment you start trying to make the metahuman body into something it's not.   Lose a limb? That's sad, but you're still very much yourself. Clone a replacement? Awesome, you're back to square one. Decide to get a two-for-one deal and pop in a third arm? All right, now you're going to lose essence. You're working with something you weren't meant to have, something you weren't meant to be.  I'd suggest Essence is a way of quantifying your soul, and essence loss is the adverse effects of your soul not recognizing the body it's in. A hidden body compartment is (with qualifiers) just a cavity like, say, a bullet wound - but it's obtrusively present and meant to be used, in a way a bullet wound is not. You turned your body into something else, just a little bit, and your soul doesn't like it.  Just my two cents. I've been thinking about a null-essence PC who's as cruel and arrogant as he is visually unsettling. Someone whose soul has packed up and left, but forgot to turn the lights out on its way."
Shadowrun,39ktli,psykulor,2,Sat Jun 13 01:05:24 2015 UTC,"Now some of this doesn't hold up as bioware again causes Essence loss (in 3e, it was different).   It didn't hold up very well to me when Man and Machine came out, and I'm listed as one of the authors.  To me, it seemed a big step backwards from the old ""astral template"" theory, which at least sorta makes sense of why different types of bone lacing might cost different amounts of essence (by making the cost based on something fairly subjective... which, as a game mechanic, it obviously is).   :P"
Shadowrun,39ktli,sebwiers,2,Sat Jun 13 01:29:48 2015 UTC,"I guess we won't have a fixed answer as different gms will interpret it differently. But to me, loosing Essence is loosing a part of your (meta)humanity, by that I mean that you are using cyber (or bio) ware to be ""better"" than a human thus becoming more machine in a way. While an amputee lives a tragic moment and has his own life changed everafter he doesn't loose any part of his humanity. But again I myself am uncertain.. I'm thinking about adding a houserule for my games which requires a will check or something of the sort that each player has to succeed when they want to better themselves with cyber/biowares if it replaces a fully functional limb as to me having cyberlegs implanted after a car crash for instance is ""just"" some kind of surgery. But willingly chopping your two functional legs just to replace them with cybernetic ones that run faster, well, you've got to really want to run faster. But that's just my opinion, and I'm not entirely sure since in the world of Shadowrun it is a common thing. But yeah TL;DR : To me amputees do not suffer Essence loss."
Shadowrun,39ktli,Silent-Cry,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:59:37 2015 UTC,"Another interesting side to this would be would people born without limbs have a lower essence?  If not, that'd potentially give them an advantage."

Essence loss is not loosing your meta humanity, it's loosing yourself, magically, yourself is your aura and adding chrome or your body ot diverting from it's 'reflection' damages it, bioware to a less extend, being flesh (possibly cloned from you), that's why you had a certain level of bioware allowed in 3rd ed. before loosing essence.  That'd mean that limbless people get 6 essence at creation, but would loose the same essence anyway by adding the missing limb, giving them no advantage whatsoever...."
Shadowrun,39ktli,RunescarredWordsmith,2,Fri Jun 12 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"They loose it by adding something unnatural, sure. But I think you're onto something when you mentioned differing from the body's natural aura.   Based on my loose understanding of knowledge, a mage can seperate his essence from his body and travel the ather, only up to a limited distance. When he gets back into his body, he doesn't feel too well, he's worn out. If he stays out too long he dies. The body, then, serves to protect his essence from breaking the tie that holds him to the physical world, and serves to regenerate and replenish it when he returns. Taking something strange and unrelated to the body, much the same way foreign material is rejected by the body at times, seems to cause a rejection of the spirit. It's maybe not so much that you kill a part of your essence with ware, just that you can no longer house and replenish that part of yourself."

Essence loss doesn't come from the loss of part of your body, but what you decide to add to your body.  When you install a cyberarm you are going to need a lot of drugs for pain, muscle relaxers, immune response inhibitors, etc... On top of that you'll probably need some kind of neuro-muscular interface which may involve a node at the base of your working nerves or even a small brain implant depending on where the damage is.  With a traditional prosthetic (which in 2074 is probably pretty advanced) you'll probably get excellent haptic feedback when you touch something with your prosthetic, but you couldn't rely on your prosthetic to do everything a cyberarm / normal arm could do (especially in combat), and you certainly can't upgrade your Agility and Strength (at least not in every situation) with a standard prosthetic."

It represents the body’s cohesiveness and holistic strength.""  You lose a limb, you are less whole. You are less strong. You have been robbed by fate or foolishness of a measure of your vital essence. A hole has been created within you, and if you are not a purist the obvious answer is to turn to technology to fill the void, but if you do not the void does not go away. Either way, you'll never be whole again.  That said; the rules are, of course, rather fuzzy on the matter and don't suggest any kind of scarring or maiming that would take essence, not even in Augmentation as a penalty for trauma surgery gone wrong. I am also unfamiliar with any edition other than 4th, but that's my take as my last group's GM.  Edit: Found it!  SR4 Augmentation, p. 20 - ""The primary limitation on metahuman augmentation is Essence. This attribute represents the body’s natural life force and holistic integrity. Extreme modifications or implantations push the body further and further from its natural state and closer to the mysterious threshold where the spirit seems to give up on the flesh.""  SR4 Augmentation, p. 23, Tweaking the Rules (cont.) - ""A Dangerous World  For a grimmer game, the severity of damage inflicted when using the optional Severe Wounds rule (p. 120) can be elevated in one of the following ways:  • Essence loss. Severe wounds don’t just threaten the character’s life, they also drain away life force. Each such wound inflicts between 0.1 and 1 Essence loss, as determined by the gamemaster.  • Negative qualities. Certain forms of trauma may inflict negative qualities upon the character, such as Infirm, Weak Immune System, or others of the gamemaster’s devising.""  And there you have it.

In 1 and 2, even bio ware had no essence cost, and in 3 there was a reduced cost if you mixed bio and cyber.

Shadowrun,39ktli,Beaumis,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"Problem is that you cannot take out the fuzzy new-age-speak without changing the semantic meaning of body's wholeness. The entirety of shadowrun runs on new-age-speak and always has.  The whole idea of essence is that it is not, in fact, your body. It is your spirit, the esoteric understanding of the self and the person. To lose essence is not reflected by the loss of body parts but by the replacement with things that go beyond the human. None of this is clear cut and it's not meant to be because Essence is, above all else, a game mechanic.   As an really important asside, Essence has always intentionally dodged the hard questions. You will never ever see a rulebook say amputee's have 'less humanity' for very obvious reasons. In the Shadowrun understanding of the term, a person born with a crippled limb is ""whole"".

The only difference I'm suggesting is that if you get a limb blown off, you already paid the Essence cost of getting it replaced. I mean, are we to believe that losing a leg and riding around in a wheelchair is Essence-neutral but getting a fake leg would cost Essence? All the mechanics that Essence affects would likewise make sense affecting a person going through the harsh process of adapting to a less-abled life."

That and the fact that they could have used the word ""completeness"" or ""intactness"" if they meant ""not missing any parts"".  Drug abuse, for example, causes essence loss in all editions I have seen.  Which makes perfect sense in the context of essence loss as loss of ""wholeness"".  The alternate rules you point at does not require (or that I see suggest) the loss of any body parts as a cause of reduced essence, so do not support body part loss in itself as causing essence loss.  Rather, they show the fact that yes, serious injuries (from just about any source, not just maiming trauma) tend to leave lasting pains and side effects that diminish over-all (holistic) health / quality of life."

Major invasive surgery can take quite the emotional toll on a person, and I think mechanically that'd be shown as essence loss.  However, despite the fact that is what I personally feel it should be. It is not RAW. In SR you can take off as many limbs and body parts as you'd like and still keep all your essence. It's only when you replace it with something better is when you take the essence hit."

Nowadays, I see Sams regularly dipping under 1 essence at creation, so limb loss cause Essence loss means losing a limb is fatal.

Shadowrun,39ktli,sentient_entropy,2,Fri Jun 12 16:09:59 2015 UTC,"To add to what you've said, the game (again, at least 4th edition) seems to differentiate between Essence losses that do and don't leave you a ""Essence hole"" to fill. Neglect seems to cause an erosion of essence, whereas modification (or, in my opinion, trauma) leaves you a space that can be retread and refilled without further loss of Essence.  Taking up novacoke to the point of addiction might make you so zoned out that you die, but if you lose a cyberlimb you've already lost the essence and so could replace it with no cost or risk of life beyond the danger inherent in the procedure itself.  On the other hand, if you are so modded out to the limit that you are nearing zero essence and you lose some of the last of your original flesh, I think that should be a very dangerous wound for that type of character. I think that would heighten the tension of specific risks and thus make for more interesting characterization."

So, as far as I'm concerned, simple amputation shouldn't come with magic loss.  Cloned replacement, crude prosthetic replacement, peg leg, hook hang, glass eye, pacemaker...you're never ""less human"" for that sort of thing.    It's when you start to augment, not merely replace, that Essence should factor in.  When you get a wiz-bang cybernetic arm that can get upgraded attributes, armor plating, and all the rest.  When you get bioware implanted, not just a replacement for lost organs but improvements on them.

Their affinity by and large doesn't matter, it only comes into play when you're looking to get some spiritual assistance with learning spells or skills related to that particular class of spell.  For instance a hermetic mage wanting to learn a Manipulation spell would have to call upon an Earth spirit to help him out.  Likewise alchemy assistance for a particular spell (like enchanting stun bombs) would require a Fire spirit, since combat spells are under their domain."
Shadowrun,39kwoc,Feynt,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:44:00 2015 UTC,"My specific scenario is that I have a shaman who always wants to summon earth spirits for combat, though the shamanic tradition lists earth for ""health."" So far I've allowed it because I wasn't sure, but I've been making it known to him that the spirits are not happy with him. I took the SR5 description as ""these are the kinds of spirits that are attracted to these traditions."" So earth spirits are naturally healers, but not limited to only that. But given Street Grimoire has the following, I'm think the intent is that they won't do anything outside of their role for that tradition :  ""The descriptions also include the type of spirits each tradition uses to perform particular functions, as well as the attributes they use for Drain. Mages of that particular tradition may only summon the spirits listed with the tradition, and they are restricted in the tasks they can assign them. Assigning tasks outside the general area of their tradition will not receive a response from the spirit (for example, a Buddhist mage telling an air spirit to heal him will get no response, as air is a Combat spirit in that tradition, while the Health spirit is earth)."""
Shadowrun,39kwoc,Feynt,2,Fri Jun 12 15:22:55 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no.  All spirits will do combat, but you can't order a Earth spirit (domain Health) to cast a stunbolt at someone.  They just don't know it.  Whether you want the spirits to be angry that they're being purposed for their wrong affinity (healing spirits used for combat, combat spirits used to sustain a Heal spell to completion, etc.) is up to you, but they aren't so rigidly incapable of performing outside of their domain as to make a health domain spirit unwilling and unable to fight when ordered."

Shadowrun,39kwoc,Feynt,2,Fri Jun 12 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"generally how I play it, as the GM, is that if you say a general combat order (""Take that guy out!""  ""Protect me/us!"" ""Don't let them follow us!"") then it's up to the spirit (the GM) to decide exactly how it goes about accomplishing that goal.  If a player does have a specific idea of what they want to happen I'll take it into account, but spirits in my game also don't want to get disrupted, so they're usually going to try and accomplish their orders in the safest way possible.    That said, if you give a specific order (""Use Engulf on that guy!"") then that would work too.  The book, in SR4 at least, seems to suggest that a general combat order will lead to the spirit fighting on it's own control until the combat is done or it's dismissed as one service.  While using a specific spirit power will count as it's own service, for that one use.  That's how I've done it in the past at least."

So you're banking on the Force 1 Spirit not getting any hits with 2 dice (or 3 with Spirit Whisperer)?

Shadowrun,39j699,PinkTrench,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:14:59 2015 UTC,depends on the levl of the campaign. The book does well bu you also have to gauge your players. If you are going gritty and stret level payment might be a couple hundred nuyen and reasonable tools for the run. Prime runners might get 5/6 figure runs every once in a great while (this is usually a team split not 100k per runner).  Karma is where everything goes crazy. Base is usually 4-5 with another 3-4 for good/creative role playing. I also reward players for not blowing through edge like it's a tangable resource. It's okay to be lucky every once and a while bbut the story looses flavor if you always ace a run.

Shadowrun,39jv28,darklordmo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:35:06 2015 UTC,"Howdy. Welcome to the sixth world.   I'm a relatively new player myself with only about 2 years of experience under my belt. I will try and answer as clearly as I can.   First. I would advise a few things. A) don't feel like you need to fill in ""gaps"" in the team. If your gm is even slightly decent, he'll be able to give you an appropriate task that fits the team composition. That means that you can have a team of all the same type of pcs.  B) I would advise against a matrix or magic based character for start. (This is my personal observation, feel free to disregard) there's essentially three worlds in SR, meat, matrix and magic. In order to get to use magic and matrix, you will have to grasp the meat world as well, meaning you need to learn two sets of rules instead of one. I would advise getting a good grasp of a meat based character first, then moving on. If you feel a good grasp of the meat world rules, go ahead and aim for a magic or matrix character. They can be super fun.  C) technomancers are on the hard side of grasping and roleplaying. Functionally I believe a decker is better, and theme wise, they're farther from harm than a techno.  Second. Regarding SR:returns. The characters in the game are usually prime runners, so while in theory it's possible to design characters similar to them, it's probably not possible for a beginner who's playing a normal level runner. Still, I've seen people try to create them, it's a good exercise in chargen.  Third. The games and the PnP are somewhat different in design. The games don't have edge for example, and the rules are more similar to 3E shadowrun. (I'm probably wrong on this one, someone else correct me if so) On the plus side, the role playing is pretty cool in the games, especially how certain dialogue can only be done if you have specs in a certain field.   Fourth. New Orleans is mentioned in some areas. the wiki and the subreddit here have some good resources. There's also some books iirc but I don't remember them off the top of my head.   I'd like to end with the golden rule. ""Shoot straight, conserve ammo, and never, fragging ever, make a deal with a dragon."""
Shadowrun,39jv28,felicidefangfan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:52:26 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be to make an infiltrator:  You'll have 2 roles (neither of which is necessarily covered by your team), bypass security to break in undetected and not arouse suspicion from people you come across.  There's lots of ways to make it (just do a search through this subreddit you'll find plenty of detailed guides), but essentially you'll need some skills like sneaking, locksmithing and gymnastics to move about and rewire maglocks, and some skill like con and etiquette to bypass people. As a plus you team might have you handle some of the face responsibilities (but without all the pressure of being expected to succeed every time) which might let you learn that role.  As for the mechanics; the video games play like ""shadowrun lite"", the setting is the same but the rules are really really simplified.   For example casting a spell in the video games uses willpower to decide its effectiveness and has a cooldown between power uses, the rpg uses magic + skill for effectiveness, then willpower + another attribute to handle drain (as there's no cooldown). And thats ignoring things like how spells in the game having only one effect rather than you being able to use the spell how you want. For example the flamethrower spell in the video game can only be used to cause damage to people during combat, in the rpg you can use it anyway you fancy; combat, cooking your toast, attempting to set fire to a building, trying to melt the protective casing off a server rack.   One of the most important distinctions (which might be what scares you off trying a face) is etiquette.   In the video game you needed lots of different etiquettes to unlock a variety of talking options. In the rpg etiquette is just a skill that represents how well you pick up on group dynamics (and/or social rules), for example knowing how to act at a high class dinner party, or how a wageslave would act as they scurry into the office to start work. Things like the urban etiquette specialisation are just bonus dice to specific situations in the rpg, not prerequisites to interacting with everyone on the street.   For the setting ask your gm, he will either point you to where he read up on the setting (the source book or the webpage) or (if he made up details/altered details) he can inform you of the events as they take place within his game."

There are no spirits of any tradition that take Hardened Mystic Armor and this line in their entry would seem to say that if there is no spirit in your tradition that has the power you want to give your ally spirit that you cannot give it to your ally spirit. Although with that restriction that means there are ALOT of powers that an ally spirit wouldn't be able to take. Including some of the best and most interesting like Endowment and Storm. Hmmm.

Shadowrun,39iuh4,Paddywagon123,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:49:31 2015 UTC,"Another question I forgot about till now. Ally spirits dont start out as a normal spirit and then have things added to them correct? They are a from scratch make what you want spirit and their base form could be whatever you want. It doesn't need to be a Fire elemental Ally Spirit for example.    Also, my PDF copy of Street Grimoire (haven't been able to afford hard copy yet so friend gave me a copy of his pdf version) has the following entry in the Ally Spirits section and it makes no sense whatsoever to me.    ""ATTRIBUTES An ally’s Physical and Astral attributes equal its Force. However, allies start with an Edge attribute equal to the Edge of its conjurer. Inhabitation allies follow the rules for the Inhabitation power (p. 195) to determine physical attributes.""    So do you think in the Attributes entry that they meant to say Mental instead of Astral? If not how are you supposed to figure out the spirits mental attributes? I mean Astral attributes are normally determined by your mental attributes. Very confusing. Also kind of disappointing because many normal spirit forms have attribute scores higher than just their force, so this would mean that ally spirits are outright weaker attribute wise. Obviously their customizations and extra abilities would make up for this but it does seem a little odd to me."
Shadowrun,39iuh4,VoroSR,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"Ally spirits are more like animae. They're not an element, they're just kind of a spirit...that looks human.  Also, Ally spirits might have crappy attributes, but they basically have unlimited services and can be improved over time."
Shadowrun,39iuh4,Paddywagon123,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:20:41 2015 UTC,"Just thought of another one. What is the background count of a Magical Lodge? Is it the Force rating of the lodge?  also this entry in the Background Count section confuses me. Can anyone break it down a bit further for me to make it easier to understand?    ""ALIGNMENT The background count is applied as a positive modifier to the limit tied to the skill or skills for an Awakened character aligned to a domain. For example, a Wiccan shaman trying to conjure a Force 4 spirit within a Hag Bolette ring (Rating 3 aligned to the Wiccan tradition) will have a Conjuring limit of 7 (4 + 3)."""
Shadowrun,39iuh4,VoroSR,2,Fri Jun 12 03:11:47 2015 UTC,"A background count impose a negative dice pool penalty equal to its rating for all tests linked in any way to magic (such as spellcasting, summoning, and skill tests that use active adept powers such as Killing Hands or Improved Sense). The exception to this rule are  background counts from domains, where a tradition, person, skill group, or skill may be exempt from the penalty as they are used to or aligned with the domain.   and   Background count makes Assensing, Astral Perception, and Astral Combat more difficult to do. Impose a negative dice pool penalty for tests associated with these skills   and   The background count is applied as a positive modifier to the limit tied to the skill or skills for an Awakened character aligned to a domain. For example, a Wiccan shaman trying to conjure a Force 4 spirit within a Hag Bolette ring (Rating 3 aligned to the Wiccan tradition) will have a Conjuring limit of 7 (4 + 3)   So essentially, if background mana is low (or high but not alligned to the affected mage's tradition) then any magical individual trying to use magic in the area will have dice taken out of their dicepool equal to the rating of the background count (so casting a spell with a normal dicepool of 12 in a rating 2 mana ebb (2 below normal count) would leave you 10 dice, whereas performing a ritual on ground attuned to hermetics at a rating of +4, when you are a shaman with 12 dice, would leave you with 8 dice).  On the other hand if you are attuned to the high background count you DON'T gain bonus dice, you simply gain a bonus to any magical limits while in the area (so a hermetic mage in the first scenario with a dicepool of 12 also loses 2 dice in that rating 2 mana ebb, whereas on that aspected ground he DOESN'T gain 4 dice, his limit is simply buffed by 4 while his dicepool remains unchanged"
Shadowrun,39iuh4,felicidefangfan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:45:31 2015 UTC,Ok that makes sense. I mean I do still think its a bit odd that they chose a limit increase instead of a dice pool modifier to be the upside of being aligned but it does seem that that is how the rules are meant to be interpreted. Thanks for helping to clear that up :)
Shadowrun,39iuh4,nick_nork,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is the main reason to aspect an area to your tradition is repeated use of rituals, summoning or enchanting.  In all those cases you will most likely be performing them at the same site (especially for corporations; the same guard spirits and wards in an area, lots of foci being made repeatedly etc) and the biggest hamper to those actions is the limit (as in all those cases your limit is the force, requiring you to spend reagents if you want to make the most use of your hits). Thus it seems catalyst worked domains to be an alternative to expensive reagents as opposed to more dice that won't really assist your test 90% of the time."

I don't know if Attribute Boost 4 is worth it. It's 10 dice compared to the 7 you'd get with only 1 - and a lot more drain besides. Many of the ""free-running"" Adept Powers are also of dubious use. At any rate, getting Combat Sense - at at least 1 rank - is a good idea.  All your 1 rating skills are a terrible waste of skill points. It's better to buy up a few skills at higher levels, and then buy the rating 1 ones you want with karma (at chargen or later). Buying up your primary, higher-rank skills will cost you a lot of karma (and more time), while getting a skill at rank 1 is just 2 karma - spending all those points on R1 skills is like throwing karma away.  Heavy Weapons isn't that useful a skill for most. It's good for Ares Alpha's (of all things) because of the added grenade launcher, and it certainly has its uses, but for a runner, automatics or longarms is much more useful (about the same raw power at the high end, but those have non-forbidden options). Astral Combat isn't that useful - just get a Weapon Focus some time soon (you want that anyway) and you can carve up spirits that way. For a mage who can project, it might have some use, but not for an adept.  Also you need Sneaking and Perception."

I'll definitely look over the powers again; I thought I had to level that power for it to be useful, but it seems that's not the case. The free running things might not be that useful, but I'm willing to make the trade for awesome in that case.  Looking at it, I see the mechanical advantage of adding those skills after creation is pretty huge in the long run. I chose heavy weapons because I was planning on using machine guns as a primary firearm; was this correct? I wasn't sure how Astral combat worked; thanks for that.

Anyway on top of that, Machine Guns have no legal option (and you will end up going to places where that makes a difference), and even HMG's outperform the Ares Alpha by only 1 DV. So in general, Assault Rifles are a better option for most characters.  Attribute Boost is a bit weird, because it rolls MAG+level. So the first level gives you 7 dice, and then you get +1 die per level. So the first is awesome, the rest are meh."

Shadowrun,39iw6v,suddoman,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"Pregens have other dubious choices at times - and in Core, there were only two options anyway (although it's still one of the most common). And having it listed as hermetic is probably fine - just saying it'll be more broad in practice."
Shadowrun,39iw6v,ElevatedUser,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:04:51 2015 UTC,So with Adepts you can take Qi Focus at less Force cost if you already have points in them. I am wrong.  Also you have no fake SINs or Licenses. So you'd better keep those swords wrapped where no one can see them (they would require a license) and hope you never have a bump in with police.  You should also look into getting more disadvantages. I personally feel like Disadvantages make my character more than their advantages and they provide Karma to help balance your character out.
Shadowrun,39iw6v,suddoman,2,Fri Jun 12 16:23:01 2015 UTC,"Qi Foci cost the same (in force and whatever) in all cases - 1 Force per 0.25 Power Point. It doesn't matter if you have levels in it or not at all.  The only exception (and it's not really an exception) is Increased Reflexes, but that's because the first level costs 1.5PP and the others 1PP each.  You're right about the disads and the licenses though."

It still sees quite a bit of traffic. Like /u/Makarion says, there's some staunch old-schoolers there, who sometimes spend their time debating the virtues of previous editions (though I don't think I've ever heard someone evangelise first edition, but plenty of second and third edition fans). But the depth of knowledge of such luminaries as Ancient History, Adam Jury, Bull, Pistons, and many other Shadowrun freelancers made the trip to the boards worthwhile every time.  For a long time, before there was a strong official web presence in the wake of Shadowrun Returns, they were the unofficial official Shadowrun forums. They also spawned a bunch of spin-off boards (Bulldrek, Animalball, The True Facade, e.g.) that each were well-visited sites in their own right."

There are definitely a couple of parts of the book that stick with you afterwards (the euthanasia scene especially for me).  I'll also say, if you like Burning Bright, consider getting Bug City on PDF -- it's the sourcebook that covers the CCZ, and its narrative parts, especially the shadowtalk at the beginning, are very good."

The more recent Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun Dragonfall are the most accessable.  You can get it on almost anything from iOS to Android and on Windows, Linux, and I think OSX.  It doesn't take a whole lot to run and are great experiences, and will likely come up super cheap during the summer sales.

And as presented in SR5, those are all the grapple rules you get.  However, there is a lot of mechanics introduced in Run & Gun (techniques, maneuvers etc.) that flies in the face of that; it seems the authors really wanted grappling to happen a lot in combat, and to be a real combat option for runners for taking an enemy out (crushing jaws, sweep, constrictor's crush, karmic response, etc.).  I could just pretend that all this mechanics doesn't exist, but I think they are kind of cool (think of a big brute that crushes people to death with his bare hands, and then throws the carcasses at other foes). They're just too slow as-is."

Shadowrun,39j07z,Ivan_Whackinov,2,Fri Jun 12 17:30:06 2015 UTC,"Clinch and Subdue both grant the Superior Position bonus, so you have that going for you.  +2 dice FTW. Clinch also gives a penalty to weapon attacks, nice if you're unarmed against someone with a weapon, it can help level the playing field.  Note that Clinch is Agility+Gymnastics, not strength, so you may be able to Clinch someone you couldn't otherwise overpower. Ti Khao gives you an additional +1 DV when clinched, also nice. Clinch and Throw Person are both Simple Actions, so you can do some serious crowd control by tossing people around.  Particularly nasty if you're fighting on a roof, moving vehicle, etc.  9.8 m/s2 tends to defeat even the heaviest of armor.   The obvious use is to subdue someone without killing them, but there are lots of other applications.  As you mentioned, a good grappler will also be a good striker, so take both, and have lots of options in combat."
Shadowrun,39j07z,Sebbychou,2,Fri Jun 12 21:54:27 2015 UTC,"Clinch in particular is useful for taking advantage of a situation.  Beyond that, from.the top of my head...   Ex: You unarmed clinch an opponment with a katana. the clinch winner gets superior position (+2), and the oponment Reach bonus becomes a penality (-1) (or in the case if a gunman, he gets a penality equal to your net successes on on REA+Gymnastic vs REA+INT, which can be very, very substantial. If you compare to the normal conbat situation, the opponment might have superior position just by virtue of having reach and he gets the additional +1 from reach and you get -1 on defense. Then neither can move away more than 2m per turn. You can also then knockdown your opponment, further netting bonuses (another +1, and he gets a further -1 to hit, -2 to dodge) In addition to that you can then throw your opponment (A troll can literally use Throw as a Disgaea movement maneuver, too) and a stuff like TiKhao can up your damage rating by up to +2 while clinched. FURTHERMORE someone being clinched or subdued might not be able to apply his own specialist skill bonuses if he had for exemple ""strike"" or ""karate"" while you've got Aikido or something. It can be a big game changer, stacking high penalities for the ennemy AND bonuses for you. Averagely or poorly skilled characters that are strong can be pretty good at subdual if they edge the initial test. A subdued character is immobile, granting a lot of situational bonuses to teammates. It's the suppressive fire of melee combat You don't need to roll to hit to do damage in subdual, as well as being the only reliable way to do Stun damage when you have cyberlimbs or bone lacing/density and not an adept.  Constrictor manoeuvre allows you to do Physical damage while subduing, which is the reliable way of doibg physical damage for unaugmented unarmed fighters. Various martial arts like Wrestling gets sudbual bonuses Teamwork Needing to incapacitate someone who'se armor is impossible to pierce, or in  the GM case, capturing a player without making him completly hurt and unusable afterward. etc.   TL;DR: It's situational, but it can be very useful. It won't happen every fight but if you kbow how to use it, it can turn the tide. Of course it's almost entirely useless if a gaming group combat encounters happens in contextless voids and are just ""I attack. I roll dice."" Over and over and over and over like children playing DnD for the first time..."
Shadowrun,39j07z,xyrafhoan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:12:18 2015 UTC,"One good grapple situation would be knowing that you can't take out an opponent in one hit but have good odds to subdue them for at least one combat turn, thereby preventing them from say, shooting at someone with a full auto burst. Your team, given a window of safety, should be able to handle things from there.  It also has some utility on high armored foes who you are at least on-par with strength-wise if you don't have any armor penetration, which, barring adept powers or a lenient interpretation of a shock glove's damage code, can be an issue. If you see your average damage is low (ie 2-3 stun damage), the alternative moves like specific body part called shots or grapples tend to look more attractive."
Shadowrun,39j07z,Paddywagon123,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:10:30 2015 UTC,It's good CC. That troll that just bust out of the door and looks like his going to geek the frag out of your Mage? Grapple him. Even if your playing a big brushing minotaur (like I do) you're probably not going to one hit him. But a grapple allows you to main control on him and deal some serious dmg. It's what I'm working towards with my char right now. Also as a side note. Throw is an amazing technique as well.

Shadowrun,39gkra,SolemnRunner,6,Thu Jun 11 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"In short, no it does not.  The physical medium (air) and sound waves that propagate and make up the voice do not exist on the astral plane. So if a being/the target is only present on the astral (not present within the Adepts physical world vocal range), they hear nothing and therefore are not influenced by it. It is not a mana spell, so it has no effect."
Shadowrun,39gkra,defunctdeity,3,Thu Jun 11 16:53:39 2015 UTC,"this is actually a tricky question, because it is not absolutely clear which power you are refering to. If you have not read the street grimoire errata yet, the power named ""commanding voice"" was renamed to ""authorative tone"" since there was already a power named ""commanding voice"" in stolen souls. The stolen souls ""commanding voice will not work on the astral plane nor the matrix as it requires your voice to be heard by the subject. However the ""authorative tone"" might (and this is ultimately up to your GMs descision) be applicable on both the astral plane and via matrix transmission, as long as you are the one initiating the social test. The question on how to actually communicate with other astral entities is obviously something you have to figure out first, IIRC there is no way to actually ""speak"" on the astral plane, so other than using mindlink or a spirit's natural connection to its summoner I cannot think of many ways to communicate with other entities."
Shadowrun,39gkra,SlashXVI,2,Thu Jun 11 19:31:44 2015 UTC,"If you mean ""Authoritative Tone"", then yes it should. As long as they initiate the conversation, they should get the +1 for their dice pool.  It's all about presence/presentation, you're taking a dominant role in the communications by starting it.

You can usually find pretty good ones there, and then just modify them however you need for Shadowrun.  Likewise, check out some of the maps from the various Shadowrun Missions modules, and the Sprawl Sites supplements. 1E all the way up to 4E have had Sprawl Sites books, and they always have great interior maps."

Shadowrun,39g6iy,VoroSR,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:24:56 2015 UTC,Drain is a damage resist test.   No penalites apply to damage resist tests
Shadowrun,39g6iy,Bamce,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:30:28 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to thank all of you for the replies.  it seems like the general consensus is play is rough unless drain is treated like every other soak (not affected by penalties outside of reducing the attributes you soak drain with)  a few dissenting opinions have made the excellent point that this isn't really how the rules are written, but given the massive editing problems in this edition I think, for my game at least, the best path is all soak is sacrosanct, leave penalties out of it.  Thank you all!"
Shadowrun,39g6iy,TaeoG,-1,Fri Jun 19 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"Counter to what everyone else is saying, I believe something like sustaining a spell applies to Drain resistance. As far as I know, there is no rule saying that damage resistance is exempt from penalties. Environmental/vision modifiers are only listed for attacks and Wound Modifiers have specific wording to exclude them from damage resistance, so there isn't often an opportunity for a modifier to effect damage/drain resistance.  Sustaining a spell, however, is -2 to ALL tests. It should apply to drain resistance."
Shadowrun,39g6iy,korusef,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:13:32 2015 UTC,"Doing this is distracting, imposing a –2 dice pool penalty on all actions per complex form you’re sustaining. (Core p.251)   Resisting is not an action in this context. There is also an example in the side bar on p 253."
Shadowrun,39g6iy,TaeoG,0,Thu Jun 11 21:20:08 2015 UTC,"well, we're talking about spells here, not complex forms, although you'd think they'd have the same rules this edition   If you sustain the spell (that is, if you want the effect of a Sustained spell to continue), you take a –2 dice pool penalty to all tests while it is sustained.   A drain resistance test is a test, as far as I know."

I think that dragons have bumped into something that terrifies them with technology, collective learning and standing on the shoulders of giants has lead to the creation of something truly powerful, the matrix. Within that wandering landscape I think there may well be more knowledge than a single dragon can comprehend... In short, I think the dragons are starting to learn that they are not gods."
Shadowrun,39cqts,Barachiel1976,2,Thu Jun 11 01:37:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, now this has been largely ""forgotten"" due to the rights to this game being sold off to a different company, but the ""ancient prehistory"" of Shadowrun is a setting called Earthdawn.    Basically there are cycles of magic, as the mana ebbs and flows.  This is part of SR lore.  What isn't mentioned is that when the mana levels hit a certain height, the veil between the worlds grows thin enough for Cthulian entities called ""Horrors"" to come through.  Amusingly, one of these Horrors is a kind of steampunky Machine entity.    Also, once upon a time, the head of AzTechnologies was one ""Virgil Gorm.""  The Horror reputed for being able to slay and devour Great Dragons is named Verjigorm.  They were settign up that the peak was hitting sooner than expected, and a few of the more powerful Horrors were already breaking through, albeit in weaker forms.  However, as I said, Earthdawn was sold off to another company and the connecting backgrounds have been sundered as far as 4th and 5th edition are concerned, but for GMs who aren't hindered by pesky things like licensing, you can still find the leftover remnants and mine both settings for info."
Shadowrun,39cqts,knowpunintended,4,Thu Jun 11 22:29:17 2015 UTC,"Advances in technology don't just happen, they're pushed forward by a need. The reduction of slave labour pushed forward the steam engine - as a concept, steam engines had existed for thousands of years but until it stopped being easier to throw a hundred slaves at the problem it wasn't needed.   Dragons are our superiors physically and magically, on top of which it doesn't take much for them to convince humans to bend to their whims. What need could dragons have that would have made them rely on non-magical technology? They sleep through the times when magic is dormant.  In the fourth world, magic was both more powerful and more flexible than mundane technology. The advantage that technology has is that it's iterative, though, so the fifth age essentially gave mundanes enough of a running start that smart dragons avoid pissing off metahumanity enough that we aim for extinction."
Shadowrun,39cqts,Dasmage,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:25:46 2015 UTC,It's hinted in the Portfolio of a Dragon - Dunkelzahn's Secrets source book that there was a more advanced technological society at one point.
Shadowrun,39cqts,burnerthrown,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:49:41 2015 UTC,"I think they have, actually. Magic is a natural principle and force in the worlds where dragons are awake, and they have mastered it beyond anyone else. Arguably their arcane magical techniques are a form of technology, or at least the distinction is fairly irrelevant to a dragon. In that particular field they greatly surpass metahumanity.  As for why they don't have the kind of technology that we do well why would they need to? They can use magic to do anything metahuman tech could do, so why use less effective techniques?"
Shadowrun,39cqts,DuKes0mE,10,Thu Jun 11 10:35:17 2015 UTC,"No Dragons are not afraid of Shadowrunners - Shadowrunners are exactly what they are comfortable with dealing with - one foolhardy human at a time.  What Dragons are afraid of is humanity as a collective: they understand keenly how much we outnumber them, that this is our world, not theirs. Against a dragon, individuals and even great big groups pose little threat even in direct combat. But large unified bodies of (meta)humans can and have taken down dragons, we've seen this.    What do you do when your enemies are too numerous? You play them against each other. You take them down one at a time, from the shadows. Dragons have the advantage of being powers as big as corps but without all the little pieces that need to move.    Anything they want from us, they can't take by force, but they will coerce us into giving them eventually. And if this or that rebellious element refuses to play along, well, force is always a possible tactic.    It's strange to think of dragons as sneaky, but this is Shadowrun - everyone is involved in the shadows to some extent. With a dragon it's harder to see the shadow moves when you're looking at the big giant lizard. But there's a saying that dragon slayers used to have: When you're fighting one, watch the head and the tail."

Shadowrun,39cqts,Trickybiz,2,Thu Jun 11 03:55:16 2015 UTC,"Untrue. Current dragon metaplot is them being extremely worried that if they keep angering metahumans they will go extinct.  They are right. In Earthdawn dragons, while terrifying opponents, were noted by a particularly smart dragon to be routinely commuting suicide by angering namegivers enough to be slain to the point simple procreation would start getting hard in the 6th age. Which it did, which is why dragons no longer execute their criminals and instead banish them or contain them like with Hestaby and The Destroyer.  If we assume that the 8th age game is canon, dragons go extinct in the earlier half of the 6th age, with only 2 making it to the 8th.  Furthermore, only 4e pushed dragons as unkillable stat wise. In 3e earlier, and in 5e, dragons can't survive dedicated assault even by small squads. In earlier editions prime runners had to plan for dragon opponents, though not greats in general, and some dragons have died in 1 on 1 fights with metahumans. In the end of 4e's canon and the transition to 5e shadowrunners and mercs en-mass assaulted and killed dragons and were reasonably successful as part of the dragon civil war. There are even two guns designed for those mercs, a sniper rifle and missile launcher, that are capable of injuring and killing a dragon respectively without even an extremely skilled user."
Shadowrun,39cqts,Dasmage,2,Thu Jun 11 05:05:09 2015 UTC,I'd say this is dependent on the dragon. Sirrurg engaged an army backed by all the mages in aztland. Where as Alamais could be killed outright by a PC

You're not even the mage - you're the Adept or Sam.  Contact Preparation - Sticker Special.  Command-Activated Knockout or Punch.

Command Preparation - Bomb in a Can.  Clear plastic sticker with Fireball or something sim'lar in it.  Easier to conceal in a clean zone than a bomb, similar effect when set off.  Knucks of Glory - Design a set of custom knucks with a flip-up compartment in the knuckles.  Place Contact preparations inside, needles preferably.  Make these compartments wireless, and have a holder so a decker can't flip them up in your pocket and you brush against them.  Flip them up before you punch someone, so they get the 1-4 Punch preparations you've put in there all over their face.  Requires you to actually deal damage with the Unarmed skill, so you're probably the Sam, not the Mage.  Contact Preparation - Air Jordans - Click your heels together three times while wearing these shoes, and a small contact plate springs up and makes contact with the hole you cut on your sock over the heel.  You then levitate.  The mage might still need to direct you in the air, or maybe the levitate is programmed to respond to change in foot direction or some such.  But you're flying!

Command Preparation - Ride the Lightning - Casting two spells recklessly costs +3 DV per, and can hit you for a whole bunch of stun when you really can't afford it. Preparing a bunch of lightning bolts or whatever earlier lets you sleep off the stun before the run, and is nearly as good as actually casting it, for none of the drain.

Except you can.  A tiny pot of Elf-Salve and they're ready to rock.  Contact Preparation - Bullshiturikens - Put your favourite 'Touch' range combat spell on shurikens.  Toss'em.  This goes no further than that, and doesn't need to - it does crazy damage just with that alone.  Wear gloves when handling.  Contact Preparation - Wow, that must hurt - Sam or someone with a Pain Editor slaps a Mass Agony sticker onto themselves.  Or 5.  'Geeze, that must hurt, glad i'm not feeling it'.  Command Preparation - Band-Aid of Healing - Band-aids with heal spells, does the sustaining for you, simply better in every way than casting the spell if you're in combat/running away/doing other stuff.  Contact Preparation - Ninja Vanish! - slap a sticker on your hand, be invisible for a few minutes.  Whee!  Contact Preparation - Illusionary Gun - Need a gun to intimidate a thick-headed dickhead?  Couldn't smuggle one past security?  Could smuggle sticker past security?  Trid Entertainment has you covered.  Works for /any item/ you have prepared beforehand.  Including ID (won't stand up to more than casual inspection).  Contact Preparation - Why Hadvar, i'm you! - Physical mask.  Need I say more?  Contact Preparation - Ninja! - Stealth, etc.  Contact Preparation - Ranged Lockpicking - Hi i'm Magic Fingers and i'm broken as hell!  But used for what it was actually intended for, ranged skill tests, it's kinda less/not broken.  An infiltrator could get some serious use out of magic fingers, and so could a blademaster.  Etc.  There's a lot more uses.  Especially once you start factoring in street grimoire spells.  The key points are -   Use technology to enable Contact preparations. Focus on spells that are useful for mundanes when the mage can't necessarily be there. Find the 'sweet spot' where your preparations are still at full effectiveness, but you've slept off the stun of making them, and try to prepare them for portions of runs that amount of time beforehand. Where possible, trigger multiple, lower-Force touch spells to harm people using alchemy, rather than a single higher-force prep.   Focus on utility, buffs, healing, and enabling.  Leave situational spells like Improved Invisibility that might want sustaining for long times or targeting specific things or manipulating things in specific ways for on-the-run spellcasting. Don't try to make enemies set off contact preparations(gloves will foil you), force them to do so by manipulation via Palming, attack checks, or inventive placement(toilet seat lid).   Focus on what alchemy can do that spellcasting can't (double line of sight, take drain hours earlier, contact preparation buffs, letting mundanes use spells)  If you're using it as a substitute for spellcasting, be awesome in some other area, because spellcasting is still more flexible in general.  Alchemy requires planning, and once you run out of it, it's gone until you can go 'back in the lab'."

If you're not, it's not cheese.  Saying 'all instances of buying your magic up from 0 are cheese' is incorrect since there is an instance here, and it's not overpowered at all, and therefore isn't cheese.

Ball - Command - Poltergeist    Cast it on a plastic bag full of broken glass, razor blades, or tranq darts.   Sticker - Command - Levitate    Put Levitate on a kunai with the spell set to lift straight up. The target you hit will float up for Potency minutes before falling.   Sticker - Command - Animate    Use a spool of monowire as the lynchpin.  Grenade - Command - Physical Barrier (set to make a hemispherical barrier) - Hard to run away from a grenade if you are trapped within a few meter radius of it."
Shadowrun,39ge8k,heimdahl81,0,Fri Jun 12 03:27:01 2015 UTC,Poltergeist would still deal almost no damage  Your kunai would pull free or break  I would never let you enhant monowire. You are suppose to be able to touch and manipulate the lynhpin. Something that fine i cannot imaine you doing it reliably  The interionL chunkysalsaing of targets inside a grenade/barrier is a massive escalation of force. This is the kind of trick you shouldn pull out of respect. Because do it too often and the gm will do it back to you  It is also incredibly hard to do. The barrier must survive the blast to reflect. Which means it must be high force. He higher the force the bigger the area. And with the alchemy double roll system it is incredibly inconsistent.
Shadowrun,39ge8k,Bamce,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"IIRC poltergeist is a sustained spell, so it would act as more of an area denial effect.  If the levitate kunai broke free it wouldn't matter because the spell would be cast on the target you hit, not the kunai.  Enchanting the mono wire is similar. You use the spool as the lynch pin with the wire as a target so you don't need to handle the wire.  The point of the Barrier on the grenade is not chunky salsa. It is to prevent people from leaving the radius of the grenade before it goes off."
Shadowrun,39ge8k,heimdahl81,0,Fri Jun 12 18:08:38 2015 UTC,Not much of an area denial spell if it doesnt apply any penalties and does ignorable amounta of damage  Depends. Did you enchant the kunai or the paper tag? Also (on mobile atm) but part of me wants to say that levitate wouldnt neccessarily work that way.   Would need to he k the book on the targeting clarifications  as that also sounds no quite right  So the chunky salea is a side effect? As otherwise tey could  prolly bring said barrier down
Shadowrun,39ge8k,Bamce,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:31:05 2015 UTC,"Poltergeist had a visibility penalty and the damage is admittedly dependant on GM ruling. Keep in mind though, the damage is per round they are in the area so accessing a computer or breaking through  a locked door in the area could be painful.  Chunky salsa is indeed a side effect.  The purpose is to keep them in range.  Sure they could easily break the barrier, but do they have enough actions to break it and move out of range all in one turn?"

The Kunai would cast the spell on whoever you stabbed with it, levitating them.  You can touch and manipulate monowire, you just need specialized tools.  You can build and repair monowhips with the Armorer skill and an appropriate tool kit, after all.  The grenade barrier is to avoid the Dive for Cover action in one of the splats, or getting a turn of Sprinting before it goes off.  It's not for chunkalyzing, which is obvious rules abuse, admittedly 'rules abuse' in SR is like 'water' in 'the ocean'.  'the GM will do it back to you' isn't a great argument, because it depends entirely on GM.  Also, 'doing it back to you' is a terrible GM tactic in general, and if that happens, you need a new GM, not to stop doing it.

As long as your GM don't consider doors in 2070+ to be mostly automatic (most that matters are, mostly because locks and controls are in the Matrix). Doors are typically the Decker's purview unless you're in a barren. You can only trigger one Command preparation per action IIRC You might want to try a few Agony and/or IceSheet contact caltrops that you stick to your belt (so that between creation and attachment they never stop touching your aura). Any sustained spells that don't need a lot of hits are pretty good as alchemy, since they get sustained for (potency) minutes. Don't forget Alchemy is an opposed test at creation, which greatly limits potency. Spell Force in alchemy is very important, unlike most spellcasting, since it defines the preparation's Magic. (Alchemy is best when overcasting)    Addendum   Alchemy is good not to invest heavily in, since you can multiply your karma efficiency with simple overcasting. For every net hit you only get one die, while for every point of Force you also get one die. This means high magic + overcasting with a skill level of 1 or 2 + speciality is all you need, really. (Basically, as long as you can get 1 or 2 net hits on the test, you're fine)"

Shadowrun,39cim8,Bamce,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:47:29 2015 UTC,I thought /rpg's beef was that it wasn't D20.
Shadowrun,39cim8,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:53:57 2015 UTC,No way. It's the crunch. A very vocal and sizeable minority in r/rpg hates anything with a nugget of crunch.

Shadowrun,39cim8,Bamce,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, but thanks anyway. This gives me something specific to look for.   By the way, how combat heavy is this game generally?"
Shadowrun,39cim8,Bamce,2,Wed Jun 10 21:48:42 2015 UTC,"Thematically, it isn't supposed to be.  Practically, it is very combat heavy.  The book is about 50% combat rules In three different arenas.  So people gear their characters around combat.  And since that's the only thing they are equipped to do, that's the only job they accept.  If you try to make a thematically appropriate character, the others will beat you down for it, then complain to the GM that they aren't getting the high paying spy jobs."
Shadowrun,39cim8,pyro-guy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:56:14 2015 UTC,"I was planning to set up two games, one with my old group of RP-friends and another with beginners. The first ones I can simply tell if I won't go a very combat heavy route and they'll accept it, so that's cool. The newer ones just want to try their hand at RPing in general, so it should be fine. Not like they got any other reference points. Was thinking to do the one with the old group first to also get a hang on the system myself before trying to learn it to someone new.   But thanks for the feedback anyhow, game rules often concentrate on mechanics. The rest of the game, the actual story and dialogue isn't really necessary to do too many rules on I guess, except for decking and charisma and the like."
Shadowrun,39cim8,insert_topical_pun,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Universal Rule Zero.  Sure, Shadowrun has a lot of rules, but its not all math heavy.  It appeals mostly (to me, anyway) because I like to solve puzzles.  The system let's me figure out how I can apply what I know, what my character sheet indicates my character knows, and what I can imagine we know to the situation at hand.    And that's where the fun comes in.  You could say we enter through the door to the party, while I word say sneak in through the window and change into my tux... Someone else might just mana ball the party unconscious and steal all the beer.  Whatever works."

Shadowrun,39cim8,pyro-guy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:36:32 2015 UTC,"That's not my experience - but then again, I'm the GM a fair portion of the time, so I have a bit more leeway to shape the player group to the stories I like to tell.  Given that I'm very much into immersion, I've gotten to know players that understand how it's more important (in my games) to make the decisions that are in-character appropriate, and that combat isn't so much a tool, but more of a last-ditch effort when all else has failed. If people bring combat-only characters, they don't get to play.   It's all about what story the GM wants to tell, and finding the people interested in it. And a GM that tells an engaging story will never suffer from a lack of players."
Shadowrun,39cim8,Neo_Anarky_Opti,2,Thu Jun 11 00:57:27 2015 UTC,"On average, I would say that...  Combat, unless it is generally the focus of the run. Will only go on for at most 2 combat turns(rolls of initiative). Unless you have screwed up.   Most combats last the surprise round and the rest of that combat turn. Due to how the game is oriented. You are professional criminals, planning and recon are your main tools. Without them you very much run the risk of things going horrible wrong."
Shadowrun,39cim8,jWrex,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:16:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting. So, would you say it's a very lethal combat system? One or two hits in, and you're dead? It'd be really cool if that went both ways. Or would the PCs generally try to avoid fighting? If it's the first I can see a bit of stealth might be in order. Unless my players all roll Samurai Trolls or something, I guess."
Shadowrun,39cim8,Neo_Anarky_Opti,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:22:41 2015 UTC,Stealth generally is the aim of the game.  Think more oceans 11 instead of smoking aces.

It costs a troll 150 karma to get just one of their Body / Strength attributes to 9 in Point Buy; 200 karma if you want the RC/melee damage of STR 10. This is a problem orks/dwarves also face to a lesser extent in Point Buy, as well as elves with their Charisma. Point Buy really loses value if you want to play to your metatype's strengths."

Shadowrun,39bhza,MonsieurRose,3,Wed Jun 10 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"Hey there, story guy here.  I'll let the rest of the folks handle the numbers, let's talk about your motivations.  First, a few issues with your build that you should be aware of:  Shadowrun doesn't rely on healers in the same way that other RPGs do - with the right gear and training, you can keep someone alive long enough to escape, but you won't be expected to top off HP pools in a war of attrition.  Generally, Shadowrunners want to avoid combat entirely, as the system tends to be lethal and there aren't many options for recovery.  Think of a caper flick, like Ocean's Eleven or Leverage - you're expected to be ghosts, not marauders.  Nobody's following anyone around with a Healing Gun.  The lethal vs. non-lethal debate is pretty contentious.  Survivors means witnesses, and in games where your actions come back to haunt you that can be trouble.  On the other hand, in games where life is less cheap, executing well-connected people can land you a Vendetta from people you don't stand a chance against.  My advice is to talk to your GM and your table and make sure everyone is on the same page before committing either way.  Now, that said, I like the idea of a Face/Adept who doesn't need to get her hands dirty to win.  Let's focus on the Face side of things, since that's the trickiest.  As the team's expert in Social Combat, you don't have the luxury of just waiting for the shooting to start and then spraying lead - you need to be the mastermind, finding weaknesses in the opposition and exploiting them.  You will be expected to help negotiate better contracts for work and gear, yes.  You're also the one equipped to walk right through a security checkpoint armed with a fake ID and a smile and take the defenses down from the inside.  You can pick out an employee and bend them to your will, getting them to willingly surrender things that your teammates would never think of - access codes, intelligence on site security, leverage on the people calling the shots. Outside of the mission, you will be the one who knows people, and you might wind up as the team's Fixer.  It's probably a good idea to think about where these skills came from, as well as what motivates you to use them for crime instead of taking your nice teeth and classy accent to HR for a nice cushy corporate job.  Are you someone from the upper classes who suffered a reversal?  Are you someone from outside of the system who learned to pass for an insider? If so, how, and why?  Are you a career con artist?  Is this part of a game for you, maybe hoping to get close to something protected?  There's also the non-lethal angle to consider.  Special bullets and shock weapons are great, but you might consider the options with chemicals.  Shadowrun includes a number of drugs and toxins that can take someone out of the fight (or get them back into it) fast.  If your character is an expert with chems, you can KO guards with a touch before you even consider your Adept powers, or convince them to give up sensitive information without resorting to torture.  This also gives us a possible origin for your skillset - you could be a member of a criminal syndicate or cartel, or an ex-member on the run.  You could have friends and mentors in the old organization that helped you with your ""education"", and who might show up and complicate things later.  You could also go an entirely different direction - Super Spy.  Almost every organization has some sort of elite infiltrator unit, relying on tradecraft and tech to slip past security designed to catch gun-toting cyborgs and battlemages.  You could have a history with one of the morally ambiguous factions, perhaps the Tirs or the Draco Foundation, and taken early retirement after some sort of personal revelation or tragedy.  You could also still be active, building an undercover identity and waiting to be reactivated!  Let me know if you have any questions or want to keep brainstorming here, this is fun for me."

It helps on the longer term healing aspect, but it is also the go to skill for keeping someone sedated.  Anyone can just let a med kit do its thing, or slap a trauma patch on and walk away.    Consider a talk and walk build.  Good at the face stuff, but capable of bailing out of the fight the moment things fo pear shaped.

The first time we tried SR, it was a complete fucking mess. I was the first to quit, though, when I found out I missed vital, superexpensive stuff for my rigger (like the frickin' RCR and a goddamn deck) that I had no way of paying for. The Doberman I had was effectively worthless when I found out (it also died on its first mission, shot to pieces by the club loving guncrotch for hire, the Captain). I might as well have been a cripple, and instead just stay in one safe place and fight. The fact that you have to go into the Matrix to control your drone annoys me greatly, and the autopilot program seemed very complicated at the time. Even now, on our second try (aka new campaign), when my GM knows more of how the game works, I feel like I'm failing. Don't even have a working drone yet, and I'm actually in the red economically due to the deck I bought at the end of Character creation. I can try to send you the sheet, if you know a quick and easy way I can send you a PDF.  Part of the problem comes from the fact that we're just three guys (two players, one GM), so me and my buddy's skills have to be diverse. Unfortuneatly, he wanted to be the driver of our van, so we have a lot of overlapping skills, and he refuses to budge. Now, I can see why, since I'm the guy who's gonna be doing the hacking on the fly and stuff, and I can't do that while driving, but still."

To fill out your spells look into ones that do stun damage or have other uses (see Ice sheet), that way you have a way to knock someone out or disable them without killing them (usually).  Make sure you have lots of drain dice (body + will) so that you can avoid most backlash from spells.  Also you can only magically heal someone once for that set of wounds, and that Medkits won't work after magical healing.  So for example if you 8 physical damage and have a medkit use that first, then magical healing if you still need it.  Lots of Charisma for face type things, negotiate, intimidate (if you want), Con for getting people to believe the little exaggerations of your actions. Plus there is etiquette and forgery if you want to have really posh manners (helps if you are at a meet that is a bit higher class than you) or if you want to be able to tell if anything is a fake.  There is also impersonation and disguise if you want to try to convince people you are someone else.  I'd recommend you try to figure out what full concept you want and then work out what skills and such you want before you decide priorities.  Chummer can really help. Its a free program for generating characters in shadowrun, does the math for you and keeps you from spending too much karma or Neuyen.  An example of a concept this is the description of my Face:  Beautiful Negotiator and Deadly Sniper . If there someone to ask she is the one to ask the questions. Be polite and charm first, if that doesn't work the end will be swift and decisive. The face for her runners Tabby does all the talking and tries to sweeten every deal.

Shadowrun,39bhza,psykulor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:05:38 2015 UTC,"If you still want to play a healer, it's possible (though it will have a very different flavor than other games' healers).   If you want to be a face/adept, you'll want mundane healing quip. First aid is a basic skill/quipset that can be added to any playstyle, and the face would be ideal for that role (since you're usually a bit squishier than your teammates).   Alternatively, you could shunt a few more points into advanced medicine and become a full-on street doc. I've never run with one, but I could see it working with the right GM and a custom run. A street doc can not only heal combat damage right off the bat - she can also treat long-term conditions (not good for the party by itself, but good for flavor), speed other healing processes (natural as well as magical and first aid), and even augment the party midgame by putting in implants or bioware by herself. At the street doc level you'd also invest more in fast-acting drugs and apply them as needed to your allies or enemies in combat. Docs acting as pushers isn't exactly kosher, but a well-placed dose of nitro might be the difference in deciding how many limbs your street samurai has at the end of the day.  There are healing spells for healing and armoring, but if you want to be adept AND face, it might not be a good idea to have magical healing, since that would make you a face mystical adept and would be very point-intensive (if feasible at all).   Of course, this whole writeup is assuming you want to be doing healing in Shadowrun - if you don't, disregard everything I just said. There are other options as well - I have a drone rigger char who's got one Ares Duelist devoted to first aid for the party, just as an idea of the possibilities."
Shadowrun,39bhza,Spishal_K,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:15:38 2015 UTC,"Judging from your character preference in other RPGs, and the fact that Shadowrunners aren't expected to have a raw ""healer"" class, I'd recommend rolling a Mage specializing in buffing/debuffing along with a focus in Medicine and First Aid. Getting a non-combat Mentor Spirit may also be a useful asset. Dump the rest of your character ability into Face-centric skills and attributes. Rolling a Shaman will allow some overlap between the Face skills but rolling a Mage will overlap with the medical skills so you really can't go wrong either way."

I can't find anything about it in the base book, but the character has a wallwalk ability (I don't know the exact name because it's not in English) which is not in the base book either, so I guess it might be in some other source material?

The problem is that I understand the ""bonus dice"" are applying to rolls for information gathering since that's what Run Faster describes legwork as, but I don't understand what when and how I apply these bonus dice.   Is it only applied to rolls made when asking my group contact for information? That can't be the case, because a street gang costs five karma and has a connection and loyalty of one. The benefit of having a group contact seems to be, at least in theory, that there's these bonus dice that I can add to tests made ""during legwork or efforts to find help."" My connection one group contact provides a +1 to rolls that I make for legwork, but what counts here?  The problem is how grey and vague that area is. I don't know what a ""test made during legwork"" is. Shadowrun doesn't have anything like the streetwise skill from Savage Worlds that represents some narrative abstraction of your Runner's ability to hit up the streets and ask people what they know, which would be an obvious time where the +1 from my gang contact would come into play. Legwork is a fully fleshed-out segment of the game that oftentimes takes just as much time as the run itself.   If I ask my information broker contact for information and the GM tells me to roll for negotiations, is that a roll made ""during legwork?"" Does a matrix search count as a roll made ""during legwork?"" What does this connection one, loyalty one contact actually do that makes it worth five quality karma? (Especially since the Made Man positive quality gives me a free crime syndicate contact with a loyalty of three that can be used for purposes other than legwork, and ALSO costs five karma)"

Shadowrun,39bvzk,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:16:48 2015 UTC,"To get information on legwork in a Shadowrun (at least the published ones), the GM has to roll Connection + Connection for the contact to find out how much information a contact knows. You then roll Charisma + Etiquette + Loyalty to find out how much information that contact will tell you.  A group contact would add their +1 (or whatever level) rating to the other contact to determine how much information that contact knows.

I know that a few flyspies, an RCC, and the right set of Autosofts would let me accomplish that without actually having to have any kind of rigging skill - I just issue commands from VR. They're an information net more than a reliant combat attribute - no reason to get my spy network busted up in a firefight.  Rigger in general sounds fun to me, but limited by costs and damage to your toys, I guess, which is why I keep coming back around to staying mostly Samurai with a flavoring of info-gathering via either drones or Matrix...

If you move past running into sprinting, you are then considered sprinting (but it's the same as running for bonuses).  So with a walk of 12m and a run of 15m and a sprint of x2:  Pass 1: I move 10 meters here (not running)  Pass 2: I move 2 (12 total) meters here (not running)  Pass 3: I move 2 (14 total) meters here as a FREE ACTION (running now!)

Shadowrun,399jwi,SmellyTofu,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think of initiative passes as a stop-move of actions but more on the line of within those 3 long, adrenaline filled seconds I will have move about 17 meters during which I've taken pot shot here, there, took cover behind that pillar for half a second and then dash to the final destination.   So technically you're still running while standing still in an initiative pass. Like you're catching a quick breath between a short run (hence your -2) and on the flip side, our brain loves to fill in the gap or predict motion so your zig zag and stop throws off what their natural prediction (their -2) even though you've stopped."
Shadowrun,399jwi,digitalpacman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"I know. I was referring to the feeling of a player perspective it feels odd. ""I don't move this turn."" ""I shoot that guy.""

I can rebuild something similar without going as full-crazy as he did with the whole 'you can add custom common rolls and it will automatically figure them out' in a reasonably short period of time, but like joha said, it's largely a matter of time commitment. Given a choice between pretty shit and new shit, I'm gonna add the new shit every time.

Well, i have good and bad news. The good news is that PACKS  work. The bad news is that (almost) no such packs are defined.

Well, first of all, i think the orginal problem is human in this case if they won't bother to find out what they wan't to change. That is not something i know anything about, so lets move over to your questions about Chummer.   The problem is, I absolutely hate its sheets.   Your not the only one. Okay, i don't hate them, but i don't think they are pretty either.    This looks really nice but I can't seem to use it.   First of all, that version is almost a year old. The pdf there is nice, but i'm 99% sure it isn't made by chummer. I checked the files for formatting character sheeets (those are pure text) and nothing is different from the current release.   Anybody have idea how can I obtain this prototype?   Well, you can have one prototype if you start to compile chummer5 yourself, but that won't have better sheets, unless you change the sheet files yourself. If you have any webdev experience, that should be totally possible, otherwise you have to wait or learn.   Or estimated implementation date in Chummer5?   Someday. I can't give you a better answer. We have one guy who had an issue about something missing in the german sheets that wanted to poke it with a stick and see what happens, but nothing have come out that way and i'm unsure if anything will come out that way.  Creating some prettier sheets are on my wishlist, so it will happen someday. Only problem is there are a lot of other stuff that i think people want more. If you have to decide between Life Modules and Pretty sheets, what would you chose? AI Characters? A proper matrix device tab? We are only 2(+ a few loose ends) people doing this in our free time, we can't move mountains in minutes."

Shadowrun,3984jc,Shock223,4,Tue Jun 9 23:04:13 2015 UTC,"For automotive (and probably industrial and the other mechanical-based), my mindset has been three phases.   what fits into a tool box what fits into a large tool cabinet or small garage what doesn't fit anywhere else.   In the terms of auto mechanics, while there are some pretty talented people out there, the majority of people cannot change an engine with just a couple tools.  That's a facility.  Body work, frame work, build a truck, all needs a facility.  But if you're just swapping panels out or tuning the engine, that could be done with either a kit or a shop.  (depends on how much work you need to do to it.)  Need to change a tire, change the oil, swap a battery, or replace a window?  Kit.  Industrial tools: think plumbers.  What do they have in their tool box?  What do they have in their van?  What do they have to send out to purchase or make?  (kit, shop, facility.  6 axis water jet machines, heavy mills and lathes, etc. in the facility.  Bench top tools for the shop.  Hand held, portable powered, battery powered in the kit.)  Electronics: I'd argue that the home-based tinkerer has a couple of parts and soldering tools in their kit, and gets the rest online or from one of the few Radio Shacks around.  If they can adapt a circuit board and have parts on hand, they probably have a shop.  If they can make circuit boards or 8-pin timers from scratch (or microbots), they've got a facility.  Each category requires different space, but I'd still charge the 1,000 nuyen a month for the dedicated space for it.  This covers the various materials costs, power bills, and possible security measures involved.  But this is my interpretation, based off what I have read.  I haven't dug too deep to find specs laid out in print somewhere."
Shadowrun,3984jc,jWrex,2,Tue Jun 9 23:27:10 2015 UTC,"/u/jWrex has a pretty good outline, but I'll add that in many cases you might be able to do things with any of the kits, but it will be vastly easier and faster if you have better facilities.  For instance, if you're swapping a more powerful engine into a car you can do it using basic hand tools in the back yard, but it will take you forever and the chances of failure are higher; you're going to be doing some jury rigging (throwing a rope over a tree limb to hoist out the engine, for example).  Having a proper engine hoist and some specialty tools will make it easier.  Having a complete workshop with a hydraulic lift and all the latest tools & instructions will almost guarantee success and drastically reduce the time required.  It's definitely going to be a judgement call for any given project, but in most cases you can decide on a difficulty/time required and then give bonuses/penalties to both based on what tools and dedicated work-spaces are available.  You can build an entire car from scratch using only basic hand tools (people have done it) but it will literally take years and have many opportunities for failure.  With that in mind you could let your PCs attempt a project with any of the three tool sets, but ramp the difficulty & timetable up/down appropriately.  Swapping a broken magazine catch on a rifle could be done in an hour in the field with basic tools at a standard difficulty but would be trivially easy and take 10 minutes in a full shop with augmented reality instructions and exactly the right tools.  Building a new cyberdeck CPU would take months and be extremely difficult even with the best facilities - you can try it with hand tools but it will take years and be one step shy of mathematically impossible."

I am mostly interested in building decks and from what it seemed from Data Trails, Comms could be adapted into Decks via simply a kit and a few part part packs which it seems very generous compared to real life adaption.   Was also wondering how Software fits into this but that could easily be adapted via your statement above."
Shadowrun,3984jc,Spishal_K,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:13:58 2015 UTC,"According to 4e a good rule of thumb is as follows:  Kit: All tools required can be carried in a small bag.  Shop: All tools required can be loaded into a single vehicle.   Facility: Anything that requires tools that cannot be easily transported in a standard consumer vehicle.      To use auto mechanics as an example, anything that requires a full lift, machinist's shop, engine rebuilding, or other hardware beyond hand/pneumatic tools and a few jacks is going to need a facility. Simple bodywork/detailing/part replacement can be done from a shop, and something as simple as replacing a tailight, changing a tire, or minor component removals/replacements can be done with a kit."
Shadowrun,3968jk,AcidWashAvenger,9,Tue Jun 9 15:33:53 2015 UTC,"If you have access to the 5th edition rulebook, there is a handy chart there that allows you to roll up the general structure of a run. Though this is more aimed towards one-off runs, I've found it gives me a good framework for a run that I can flesh out and modify as I see fit.  Beyond that, what I usually do is set down certain plot points. So for example, during session X event Y will happen, and then improvise around that. It also helps with structure a bit I feel, putting down significant events and where they fit into the story.  That said, I don't consider myself an expert on telling good stories, but my players don't whine so there's that."
Shadowrun,3968jk,SweRacoon,8,Tue Jun 9 16:03:41 2015 UTC,"Don't try to railroad. The more you plan, the less your players will match what you're trying to do.  Just plan the big points and let the players make their way there as they see fit.  GMing is less about planning the whole thing and more about pulling correct improvisations. Plan NPCs, but not when they will appear. Plan locations/facilities the players will break into, but not how. Roll with their ideas.  Players have an innate resistance to anything that is forced upon them, so don't try to do that.  I'd also recommend starting off by buying a pre-made module and running that. You can totally write in your own stuff and deviate, but at least you'll have a solid base."
Shadowrun,3968jk,BackgammonSR,3,Tue Jun 9 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"On that note, don't be the GM that says ""No"" to what the players come up with. There will be crazy ideas that you never planned for, but as was said, roll with them.  Case in point, my players were once thinking about how to break into an office building. The guard on the floor didn't fall for a damsel in distress, so they set about breaking through the roof access. How? They decided to have the big troll launch the adept as high as he could, the adept would then wallrun, push of upwards and throw a rope with a grappling hook. It's probably one of the craziest ideas ever conceived around our table, but after a few rolls it all worked.  Of course, they failed to take into account that the rope wouldn't support the weight of the troll."
Shadowrun,3968jk,SweRacoon,5,Wed Jun 10 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"Start with something prepublished.  I'd recommend the Elven Blood mini-campaign, which is 4 interconnected runs involving the PCs with the Ancients go-gang.  Take two dice away from anything the NPCs roll to reflect that your characters are street scum and see how it goes.  A few instances of this should get your feet under you with how the players interpret the setting, and with how well their characters function.  From there, branch out and practice the most honored of GM traditions.  Steal shamelessly.  Is there a movie, book, play, or story that you really enjoy?Transplant the plot into Shadowrun, shuffle some stuff around to make it slightly less recognizable, stock up on Mountain Dew, and have a blast with it.  The biggest thing to remember is that the PCs are the main characters in their story, but they're not the only characters.  The bad guys have plans.  The neutral guys have plans.  Stuff is happening in the world that the PCs didn't set into motion.    Focus on building a mental decision tree for the other major players rather than scripting everything out."
Shadowrun,3968jk,duncanmb,4,Tue Jun 9 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"Don't feel you have to tell the story in one sitting.  In fact, take it as a cardinal ruleTM to not tell the whole story at once.  Spread it around through three or four stories.  Look at the last season of Leverage: there's a plot line there, but they don't do a lot with it all at one time.  Consider the season arcs of shows like Star Trek: The Next Generation. (No, seriously.)  For every episode on ""planet hell,"" there's one touchy-feeley story, one diplomacy story, and one exploration story.  Learn the three act formula.  (You don't have to be master-perfect on it.)  Set up, intriguing middle, climactic finale/denoument.  Something for every type of player, mixed in.  Intrigue for your mental types, social for your butterflies, combat for your hack-n-slashers.  Pull from their backstory.  In fact, starting with some of the common backstory, weave a situation where they feel like they need to (of their own volition) trust each other to operate as a team.  But also leave them the space to have their own adventures away from the group, without them feeling like they needed the group to pull it off."
Shadowrun,3968jk,jWrex,3,Tue Jun 9 23:14:36 2015 UTC,"You probably already know a lot of this from your experience with other games but I've tied it all together to show the flow of how I put it all together.    Step 1 for me would be talking to the players, now you know these people and probably have a good idea of what they're looking for in the game in regards to the measure of roleplay and combat. I'm mostly just putting this down in case someone else searches later.  Following on that, to get the proper flavor I'd read through the various short stories in the sourcebooks. Those can give you some inspiration to get the right feel of what you want to do.  From there I start piecing together a story in acts. Each act is roughly a gameplay session although as always things can go wrong and they go through it faster or slower than I anticipate.  Now that I have the bones of the game, it's time to flesh it out. Design the important locations, any NPC's I might need such as security guards and so forth. Small part bits don't need to be as filled out as a player would be but any really important npc should. You need to know their motivations and personality.  A lot of these things like guards or random npc's can be carried over between games (perhaps with adjustments). It's a good idea to have a file of these so when your players surprise you, they're an available resource to support you winging it without causing much of a delay."
Shadowrun,3968jk,Reoh,3,Tue Jun 9 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"Okay so you've got a very vague outline. You just need to expand it.  First step is deciding how many ""Plot"" runs you want to do. Since you're starting out early, I'd probably recommend not jumping in two deep, and doing a two-run campaign.  Combine this with 2 very short ""side quest"" optional runs from your contacts.   1) You have them start off as slummers.  Have the first run deal with something related to whatever good/bad thing Horizon is doing that you want them to get mixed up in.   2) After the first adventure they've gotten a taste for something deeper going on behind the scenes. Maybe a mysterious bad guy that got away or some paydata that doesn't add up.  Now is where your other minor faction reaches out to the group to do a run against Horizon that is related to their first run.    3) Between run 1 and 2 have a couple optional runs they can do from their contacts.  Maybe in Run 1 they find some paydata that a contact is interested in, but they the runners to go dig deeper on it. It's a side quest so make it simple, maybe a single combat encounter or a couple social encounters. At the end, it gives them a hint or a resource to give them an advantage in Run 2.  Maybe a contact who has Matrix codes for a building they have to break into.   4) Optional run #2 should be pretty much the same type of thing as #3, but with a different reward. Maybe some weapons or some plot information that will help them out.   Hope that helps!"

Shadowrun,3968jk,mikekozar_work,3,Wed Jun 10 00:27:59 2015 UTC,"Writing a Campaign 101  The first thing to understand is the structure of a dramatic arc.  The short version is that a character starts in a normal or comfortable place, hits a problem, rises to the challenge, pays a price for victory, and returns to the place of normalcy changed.  If you aren't familiar, go check out this series of articles:  Story Structure  In game terms, this means that we want to put our characters up against something that they want to overcome, but they need something they don't yet have - levels, gear, information, or allies.  Getting that thing should involve an important personal sacrifice, like choosing sides in a conflict or accepting an obligation to someone dangerous.  Nobody gets emotionally invested in a Participation Award, make them feel like they earned it.  The second important thing to remember is that you can't write for an RPG as if it were a linear story.  You can use tricks like starting in media res or flashbacks to control some parts of the story, but sooner or later the characters are going to completely surprise you.  If you just focus on the story you're expecting to tell, you won't have material when they force you into the story they want to hear.  The secret is ""world-building"".  You want to take every opportunity to flesh out the people and places around the main story.  A character who shows up as a throw-away gag during a mission becomes a contact in a later story.  The ads running in the background turn into foreshadowing.  Build every part of your story so that you can re-use it if the players decide to go in an unexpected direction.  The more world-building you do, the better prepared you are to not just show the players something cool, but to work with them to make something cooler.  Taking those two ideas, world-building and story arcs, you can start to sketch out your campaign.  I like to think of it as episodes of a TV series - each adventure stands on it's own, but also contributes to the bigger arc and does some world-building.  Start by establishing the world as the characters have always known it.  This is the ""place of comfort"" that they need to leave on their arc, but that doesn't mean it has to be easy.  A team of wannabe mercs who have to share one scavenged machine pistol might live in constant terror, but it's the world they know and understand.  I like to run one adventure here as a Pilot - establish the most important things about the world and the characters, let them have some fun doing what they're good at, and tease the drama that's coming.  Now you want to start throwing challenges at them - I like to run 2-3 minor arcs and a major arc.  For instance, a cult kidnapping people, a cartel carving out a new market, and the local Halloweeners gang holding a grudge.  Each one of these plotlines spreads across three adventures - one where the bad guys are established, one where the threat is raised, and one where the team confronts them in a showdown.    That should account for 9-12 plotlines outright.  Spread them out and mix in a few one-shot adventures, monster of the week or comic relief episodes.  Go back over the list and look for ways to tie in the PCs - adventures where they deal with personal problems or goof off in a ""day in the life"" are great.  Remember that for special occasions, it's fine to hand some of the players NPCs and say ""Today Big Henry is going to visit his family, so you guys will be playing Big Lucy, Bigger Henry, and Huge Carl.""  If you can manage it, this makes for an excellent B-plot while the main mayhem is going on.  Every one of these adventures should include some world-building.  You want to avoid the awkward info-dump, but find time to introduce something or someone new every adventure, or show more details about stuff they already know.   Remember, everything that you introduce is something you can (and should) use later.  It's the nature of an RPG to grow organically as the players introduce chaos into your plans - embrace it!"

Or make it up on the grid that's provided already.  (Use the Map layer, so players won't accidentally move a wall.  Don't ask how I know.)"

Shadowrun,3974z0,Listener-of-Sithis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"Roll20 is very effective, but the amount of work you put in is the quality you get out. It's not hard to get maps, or tokens, but it is time consuming.   If you're just looking for someone to give you the maps and tokens and everything... good luck? I don't know if anyone has what you're looking for, but I guess we'll find out."
Shadowrun,3974z0,Dallico,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:20:58 2015 UTC,"There are two places you can try to play online, and even run games if you like.

They both offer games and GM positions, and are, to my knowledge, and a large pool of players to choose from, if you don;t mind filling out a bit of extra paperwork after a run.  As for maps and the like, I commonly use theater of the mind, with only a small map for an idea of where things are. Mainly its just floorplans for buildings, otherwise I just wing it. As for tokens, I got nothing. I've only really used it as a player and I haven't really made anything on my own for it."

Detention and Holding, these are the cells you see at police stations.  They are only supposed to hold you in them for no more than 72 hours I believe.  Then you get processed and sent to Jail to await trial.  Jail is for less than a year.  Finally, you go to court and get your trial.  If you have more than a year sentence, you go to prison, otherwise back to jail. Prisons are contracted out but jail is still a government institution until you get labeled felon."

Anyway regardless, if he's in a dedicated holding area it's probably not that secure - in that, there'll be plenty of trideo security and enough personell, but probably not the highest quality personell, and since it's a small facility, not that much of it. Think generic police-level (maybe less), which for a shadowrunner is managable. Half a dozen or so? Of course, HTR is probably on quickdial.  I agree that DW probably wouldn't be allowed on; they probably have their own in-house medical response teams. Probably not as good as DW - gotta save money somewhere."
Shadowrun,395izt,Semicidal,2,Tue Jun 9 12:44:04 2015 UTC,Yeah his character isn't the smartest button in the box. I'd upped the security on the border due to the happenings going on caused by the PC's.
Shadowrun,395izt,CitizenJoseph,2,Tue Jun 9 12:54:30 2015 UTC,"You say illegal guns, but that may not actually be the case in the PCC and Sioux territory.  Automatics, yea, those are illegal.  But hunting rifles, shotguns and even some pistols aren't illegal.  A lot of ammunition is illegal as are some accessories.  If he was on a dirt bike and off the roads, he may not have even been violating driving laws without a license.  Lying to the cops is a misdemeanor I believe, so if he can somehow prove that he WAS delivering a pizza, like he was on the way to get the pizza to deliver it, he can skate by on that.  If he can justify his guns, like self defense on the desert, he might skate on that as well.  Illegal border crossing is the hard part.  That's immigration laws.  It is legit possible for him to walk after paying a fairly stiff fine.   It is also legit possible for him to be shot for treason.  Get a lawyer ASAP."

This is a good change to give him stun damage or a temporary stat drop (hungover?) to prevent immediate retaliation, or if he is a difficult player, hit him with an addiction.

Is it Lone Star or other private enterprise, or is it run by the government? Also might be worth thinking about where it is located. If they hold felons overnight at the station house, that's your answer for security. If it's a dedicated site for overnight holdings, it can run the gamut, but for the regular drunk and disorderlies and other minor offenders, I'd wager it's pretty minimal.   Would Doc Wagon be allowed in there (he had an idea to break one of his own bones to get Doc Wagon to come get him, then the rest of the team hits the Doc Wagon van in transit).   I'd say no. In the case of extraterritorial corps, DocWagon need permission to enter (which I doubt they'll get in this case), and there's always the issue of getting on the wrong side of government law."

Don't forget that the limit would be the phsyical :)  Edit: the throwing weapons in run and gun all have slightly higher penetration and DV than what I've given for a sling, which makes sense to me considering they are sharper/more effective as weapons"

Shadowrun,3950wv,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:55:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! The issue I have is that cybereyes cannot be equipped with x-ray vision (at least as far as I know) and there are no x-ray sensors (as far as I know) - only using SR5 sources btw. I'll gladly be proven wrong, but that's the reason why I started wondering how a CT scanner would look like in 2075. I assume the detrimental effects of radiation and that it's relatively clunky (in the context of Shadowrun) technology may have something to do with it.  Anyway, yes, if treated as a sensor (array) of an appropriate rating (I'd say rather high for what it's supposed to do) then it's gonna be big no matter what. So many thanks, hadn't though of that :)"
Shadowrun,3950wv,ActualSpiders,3,Tue Jun 9 12:13:27 2015 UTC,"The main issue with some types of medical device is simply the portability/convenience. For example, an x-ray machine shoots a flash of x-rays through the target and onto a photographic plate behind the target. While you could put an x-ray emitter into a cyber-eye, all you'd be doing is irradiating random passers-by without holding some sort of media behind them (which might be just a bit obvious...). If you want to get a 3D scan of someone's body with your cyber gear, you're going to have to walk completely around them while pointing whatever you're scanning with at them. Again, a bit suspicious, tho maybe possible from a drone with some sort of telescopic capability..."
Shadowrun,3950wv,dethstrobe,2,Tue Jun 9 16:41:23 2015 UTC,You could probably use an AutoDoc. Which is a drone designed to perform surgeries and other medical care. I think there are stats for one in Bullets and Bandages.
Shadowrun,3950wv,Malkleth,2,Tue Jun 9 14:31:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thanks! Actually, there is a device ""GE Statscan"" that does exactly what I describe, but it's a handheld device and thus, hopefully, with only limited capabilities (and maybe a bit OP?).  What could make sense is a scanner that not only provides a ridiculously detailed 3D/AR image of the scanned body (which can be practiced with, etc.) but also has other utilities, such as detection of bioware (within reason). In short, it would give a complete and detailed report on the state of the body. This would require powerful sensors that demand more room as CitizenJoseph kindly pointed out, making it a relatively large device.  I'll have to ponder this a bit more..."
Shadowrun,3950wv,Saarlak,2,Tue Jun 9 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"Bullets and Bandages goes into this a bit. A cybereye would be pushing it, but there is an imaging device that can provide a real-time AR projection of the patient's internal anatomy that is handheld, or takes up 2 slots in a cyberhand. I suspect what you might be looking to have your PCs steal is a fancy new version of an autodoc, which is going to be big enough to hold a person. These are the things ambulances are equipped with, they also seem to come in the form of a big wheelchair (including a walker drone)"
Shadowrun,3950wv,felicidefangfan,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:35:03 2015 UTC,I haven't read anything covering specific medical equipment like you mentioned there is the option just modify something. I believe 4e has the Valkyrie module which has sufficient tech to allow a doctor to remote in and do surgery. Surely we can imagine something that sized (little bigger than a coffin) being able to function for CT?
Shadowrun,3950wv,BitRunr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:51:37 2015 UTC,"First of all, modern day CT scanners CAN produce a 3d image of a patient's body; its just a matter of mathematically calculating some stuff (essentially each 2d image taken can actually be though of as having depth to it as well, depending on the width of the xray beam being sent through, essentially programs can put them together to render this 3d image). In the future you might have better resolution to be able to see smaller and smaller structures though.  The truth is however that a 3d image isn't hugely useful to us, maybe in shadowrun with its trideo and AR where you might be able to zoom in and manipulate  the image much easier. 2D slices are a very practical way to ensure details aren't missed (especially as you can rapidly scroll through them to work out the 3D structure of the organs involved)  As for heat produced, there's not that much for CT scanners, you're thinking of an MRI machine as it requires supercooling to function. Liquid helium is necessary to cool the magnets to extremes.  Personally I think your idea could work, but not for a CT scanner. My suggestion would be combine it with something else (see below) or use a futuristic MRI machine - even now they cost millions and are the size of a room, in the future I'm sure they will shrink but there's a limit to just how small you could make them.  For an example of combined tech: what if it was a new onsite custom cyberlimb nanoforge? The patient enters the ct scanner where a 3d image is used to map out their current limb (or the opposite limb if theyre missing whole or part of the one they want to replace). Once that's mapped the doctors will (thanks to really advanced imaging with a resolution waaaaaay better than current day) know the desired final shape of the limb, but also the size and positioning of the nerves and blood vessels within. Now the patient waits for the nanoforge to construct the limb, and once ready they insert their shoulder/pelvis into the slot and the forge attaches the limb to them, using the 3d scan to work out where it has to attach nerves to the machine and where it has to cauterize off blood vessels. Voila! Your prototype has revolutionized the speed at which a custom limb can be created and attached to a patient - now they need only an hour or so instead of having to wait a few days while designs are sent to a factory, the custom limb is made and then shipped out to the clinic for the operation."

Shadowrun,3950wv,BitRunr,0,Tue Jun 9 20:05:04 2015 UTC,"SR4, Spy Games;   Terahertz waves exist at the very upper end of radio waves, just below the very bottom of optical frequencies. They straddle the region between waves and particles, and they are an ideal energy source for surveillance. It helps that the waves can be tightly controlled from the emitter, making them difficult to detect. We’ve used these waves in terahertz-ray goggles, which are lightweight and effective up to 100 meters. They operate for three hours on a single charge, and they possess the “Superman” setting (i.e., the ability to see through clothing). T-rays will penetrate a single wall constructed from wood, masonry and even concrete, but they do so at a decreased range of fifty meters.  We have continued to work on scattered x-ray vision in conjunction with t-ray vision to cover all possible combinations of material. What we call the third-eye system sends out radioactive energy from a central “eye,” which is flanked by two sets of flat optical receptors to reflect the returning energy beams back to two receptors. What you get is a stereoscopic view through solid objects (concrete, plastic, steel, etc.). Materials have distinct t-ray signatures, so by using the scanner you can generally tell what type of materials you are looking at. Explosives have been one particular area of focus for people using these scanners.   These can be installed as visual enhancements."
Shadowrun,394hi5,MysticExarch,6,Tue Jun 9 04:59:39 2015 UTC,"There are five editions. My recommendation would be to play 5th Edition, as it manages to get a lot of the different aspects of the game running in similar fashions to each other and fixed up a lot of things.  Shadowrun does have a major editing problem which means some degree of house ruling may be required where the rules are vague. However feel free to quiz us as there is Errata and we've discussed most rules to death.

Shadowrun,394hi5,maullido,2,Tue Jun 9 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"True. Arguably the best way to go about it is to jump in head first into the various sections. Focus on meatspace first, since they are the most common, and then from there work towards more of what your players are based around. One way to make this easy is to have your players also learn the rules for their characters, and defer to them when you don't know about the rule to keep things moving. However, learn the rules at a quick pace, and if they are intentionally breaking them for their benefit feel free to punish them... harshly."
Shadowrun,394hi5,Dallico,7,Tue Jun 9 06:10:20 2015 UTC,"D&D rewards treasure and experience for fighting monsters and solving quests. Shadowrun rewards Karma (XP) for clever roleplaying and surviving, and Nuyen ($) for performing missions successfully and stealing things opportunistically.  D&D expects combat, while Shadowrun combat means you've run out of options. It's brutal and deadly. Not every PC needs to be an optimized combat monster to be effective.  D&D characters start weak and become gods at high level. Shadowrun characters are terrifying right out the gate but don't grow very quickly. (Increasing karma and nuyen rewards and providing ample weeks to get surgery and raise skills can make the game more progress-based, if desired).  5th and 4th editions are basically indistinguishable, but 5th is newer and has fewer problems. All editions are terribly edited and have major flaws and rules discrepancies, but there are many mechanics to reign in OP players and multiple ways to solve most obstacles. Many GMs will interpret the game rules in different ways, emphasize certain parts over others, and house rule to solve other problems. Open communication is key."
Shadowrun,394hi5,veggiesama,4,Tue Jun 9 06:54:53 2015 UTC,"To add to these points: D&D gives simple metrics to guage what level of challenge enemies will give to players; Shadowrun is not so obvious. If you're a new GM, try a couple published adventures first to get an idea of enemy vs. player power levels before generating your own baddies, as an NPC can go from cannon fodder to OP real quick with the right stat changes.  On that note, another great thing I've seen posted on this sub is ""In D&D, goblins don't call for ork back-up."" In Shadowrun, most enemies have bigger, badder enemies to call in when the battle goes pear-shaped."
Shadowrun,394hi5,lordhellion,6,Tue Jun 9 15:18:37 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend reading /u/Black-Knyght's post Welcome to the Shadows it talks about what you can expect from Shadowrun compared to other RPGs. The wiki tab on the main page of this subreddit also has a lot of resources for both players and GMs like run ideas and flowcharts (I particularly recommend Opti's matrix flowcharts). For a brief rundown of the rules, the quick-start guide for 5th edition can be found here (though I like 4th's Food Fight better).  Now that the info-dump's over, some personal opinions (yay!): The biggest thing Shadowrun does differently from, for example, Pathfinder is that it forces players to be a lot more imaginative with how they approach problems. The way it does this is by making combat incredibly lethal (I have seen characters that have survived over a year of weekly sessions die to a punk in a street gang) and emphasizing the fact that you live in an analogue to the real world (so explosives are always an option). I personally love this, it encourages everyone to think ahead and makes each encounter actually tense. It also encourages the rule of common sense; having a big gun is great, but trying to bring it into a fancy restaurant or onto an airplane has exactly the consequences you would expect if you tried that in the real world. Running with the theme of consequences, because most Shadowrun games happen in a pretty confined geographic area and the world is so interconnected there's also much more of a focus on long-term consequences. Breaking into the vault and stealing the jewels is great, but the police showing up at your front door tends to be a bit of a buzzkill. And robbing the Vory may seem smart until your friends and family start to go missing.  In terms of playstyle, Shadowrun seems to shake out into two main philosophies: Black Trenchcoat and Pink Mohawk.   Black Trenchcoat is the 'play it safe' version. The basic idea is that you're given the job, you do as much legwork as possible and concoct plans within plans within alternate plans. If all goes well the Corp won't even notice they were broken into for a week or more, which, in the age of private armies and the panopticon, is a very good thing. High Survivability, but requires a patient team and a GM willing to go into detail about everything. The other hiccup I've seen is players getting pissed that the GM is screwing with their lovingly-birthed plan, make sure everyone understands that the GM's job is to screw with them (to an extent). For even more realistic fun, have the GM be unaware of the player's plan. Good examples include Leverage and Ocean's 11, once you tone them down to a bunch of misfits and make them much darker.  Pink Mohawk is the complete opposite of Black Trenchcoat. It involves going in as loud and messy as possible; sowing so much confusion that your objective, your identity, and even the records of the break in are obscured by smoke and rubble. It helps if you have no understanding of the ideas of restraint or indoor voice. This technique depends on going as big and loud as possible, and therefore tends to require a lot more start up funds (depending on how crazy/creative the runners are). It also tends to be much more lethal but much more cinematic when it does work. The two biggest problems I see with this approach are: the players don't go big enough or they piss off the GM. If they players don't go all out they wind up with their faces on the evening news and their case moved to the top of Lone Star's (Or KE's now) to-screw list. The other problem is a bit more insidious. When players take this route there tend to be a lot of NPC casualties, including plot-important NPCs. This means the detailed plot the GM spent hours slaving away at can reasonably be expected to be blown away during the first session, and this can piss GMs off. For a good (and hilarious) example of Pink Mohawk and problem number 2, check out this.  No matter which way you decide to go, I would talk it over with your players first. Life sucks when people have different expectations.  And finally, I would recommend that, at least for the first month or two, no-one play a Technomancer. They have the most complex rules system in the book and haven't been fully fleshed out for 5th edition yet. Until the GM has a good working knowledge of both the Matrix and magic I'd keep them off the table.  Hope this helped, and wasn't too long."
Shadowrun,394hi5,pfm1995,6,Tue Jun 9 07:22:10 2015 UTC,"In regards to SR Returns & Dragonfall, they're not bad representations of the game world, but they take place in the 50's (IIRC), while 5th edition is up to 2076 last I checked. There's been a few notable events, such as Hestaby's exile, the Am-Az war, the appearance of CFD and the nanite meltdown, and more. Of course, this is as significant as you make it. (Had Dunkelzahn been assassinated by Dragonfall? I don't think he had, so that's a big thing that happened as well).  As for editions, I've only played 5th but we didn't have much issue with it, coming mainly from Fantasy Flight Games' 40K line of RPGs. Some of the rules (Matrix and magic especially) took a few reads to get right, but one can always introduce them slowly to avoid swamping new players and oneself. Or you can pick up the book, read it through and go run the shadows with all the toys.  SR plays differently, of course, but that's generally the case with most RPGs. It's quite lethal though, and if you're unlucky a single bullet will put your runner to pasture."
Shadowrun,394hi5,SweRacoon,4,Tue Jun 9 10:27:13 2015 UTC,"Dunkelzahn getting assassinated is in the end credits of Dragonfall (his name is not mentioned, just that dragon president is assassinated and blood magic likely involved)."

Shadowrun,394hi5,SweRacoon,3,Tue Jun 9 15:41:26 2015 UTC,"I may be able to give some insight as someone who has been playing D&D for about 10+ years and Pathfinder for 2 or 3, but recently picked up Shadowrun to play with a group. It is very different in play style and what you need to plan and build for when getting set up, something that can seem very foreign compared to how you'd normally play D&D. I wanted to build a melee street samurai who zipped around the field and cut people in half, but I quickly found out that guns and magic rule the landscape, so keeping a sweet melee for close quarters was nice, but I needed to know how to work a rifle with high efficiency. You'll want to pay really close attention to building good defense for a character, or have a whole lot of edge (luck), because a well placed sniper round can wipe you out if you aren't lucky. The game offers a lot of customization, which is kind of neat, from allowing you to put commlinks of varying quality in your gun, in your ear, and/or in your head, to modifying your body using a mixture of cybernetics and bioware in an attempt to power yourself up physically or mentally while dancing the fine line of losing your humanity. Even something as simple as a set of ear buds can be modified into a sweet set of aural surveillance equipment. Some things are still confusing to me, like SINS, and a good bit of the lore, but if you are used to pouring over books upon books for D&D, you should be good at doing the same for Shadowrun.  The rules are fairly easy to understand if you read slowly and pay attention. The 5e book is very, very...very, poorly laid out in my opinion and jumps around a lot while offering a lot of explanations about some things, while next-to-nothing about other things until later (it rarely references other pages it seems). I read the book twice pretty much making one character (maybe a 2 hour process), something that took me maybe 25 minutes with Chummer5, which includes stopping to look up neat stuff.  Most of my friends who play it and are more experienced seem to prefer 5e, even if 3e seems to be an edition they are very fond of for some reason."
Shadowrun,394hi5,3rdLevelRogue,3,Tue Jun 9 07:56:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say go for either 3rd or 5th.  1-3 are all similar, and 4-5 are similar, but they tend to fix things along the way. I'm not the biggest fan of 5th but I have to admit it's likely better for new players than 4th.  3rd is a LOT more crunchy than 5th, which could be a pro or con depending on the type of group you're running. 5th is still fairly rules heavy by itself, and its major con is those rules are poorly edited and sometimes very hard to find. I'd say go for 5th, but make a whole lot of cheatsheets.  My particular GMing style is to read all the sourcbooks from all the editions, and all the novels, and all the web supplements. But I'm crazy and you can easily get away with grabbing the main source book or just the quick start rules.   Shadowrun is essentially 3 worlds overlapping. The Meat world, the astral, and the matrix. Think of it like Physical, Ethereal, and Shadow from DnD, respectively.  The astral realm overlays the physical 1:1 and allows you to walk through walls and such, although interaction between the two planes is limited. The matrix is more like the Shadow plane, it mimics the physical in many ways but often contains non euclidean landscape and constructs and many things that simply aren't present on the physical side.  So the trick in shadowrun is knowing how player interact with the 3 worlds. Mages have access to the astral, and can use it for scouting, combat, and detection. Luckily (in 5e) most of those actions are handled the same way as it would in the meat world, just with mental stats supplanting the physical ones. Technomancers and Deckers and anyone with the right hardware has domain in the matrix. It has its own set of rules and its own challenges that you'll have to understand. For example the Global Overwatch Division breathing down your neck the moment you do anything illegal on the 'trix.  Essentially you'll need to know how to handle combat, perception, and auxiliary actions, physically(ranged and melee), magically, and digitally. On top of that there is social tests, demolitions, vehicles, barriers, and a smattering of other rules you'll need, likely on a regular basis.  tl;dr start with 5E, start small with only physical characters like street samurai/adepts and Face's, maybe a combat mage with just damage spells, and work your way up to the other stuff. There is a lot to grasp and it will come, but it takes some time."

Shadowrun,39220x,Reoh,10,Wed Jun 10 16:37:45 2015 UTC,Flavor is a big part of it. Clubs also don't have to look like a weapon. Picture that dapper gentleman in the nice suit with the walking cane. It's artfully carved eagle head grip is lovely to look at and causes some considerable pain when used to strike the mark in the forehead. I don't like games to be all about min/max but rather enjoyment and flavor.
Shadowrun,39220x,BitRunr,4,Mon Jun 8 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"Clubs are generally legal, concealable, cheap, and ubiquitous. They're stronger than fists, though not by much. They are often nonlethal too. It's easy to snap off a chair leg and bash somebody with it. Knives, katanas, battle-axes, and cyberspurs may be more dangerous in skilled hands, but they lack a few of the other benefits that clubs have.  For similar reasons, I had a character specialize in Sporting Rifles even though Sniper Rifles were superior in every way except one: legality. He was a redneck hunter turned shadowrunner, and you bet he had a hunting rifle in the back of his tricked-out pickup truck."
Shadowrun,39220x,Thanes_of_Danes,4,Tue Jun 9 04:31:40 2015 UTC,"From a purely RP standpoint, there's a whole bunch of character reasons why they might prefer clubs over blades. On the one hand, it could be a cop with a police baton, on the other hand it could be the guy in the mob that collects kneecaps. Or maybe the character's good at breaking objects with sledgehammers and so on? (although I don't think clubs are mechanically better at doing damage to objects than blades or unarmed, it's purely a flavour thing)"
Shadowrun,39220x,Sebbychou,4,Mon Jun 8 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"Metagaming-wise?  Not too much outside of ubiquity.

And an Adept with a staff weapon focus can be doin' stuff like this."
Shadowrun,3938py,WolfSpinneFeuer,2,Mon Jun 8 22:59:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on the skill.  If we're talking slum meatheads, 700¥ per week is shiny.  That's enough for a stable low lifestyle with a surplus available for drugs.  If you're talking about trained bodyguards or specialists, that might go up to around 1,500¥ per week or more - enough to cover a medium lifestyle, with enough Nuyen left over for some luxuries.  Of course, it also depends on what you're doing with them.  If you're planning on working them eight to ten hours a day, five days a week, those salaries would be around average (or slightly above).  If it's just for retainer on-call purposes, you'd have a lot of people jumping for that cash.  Imagine being paid that money on a weekly basis just in case you're needed."

Shadowrun,392yuf,IAmMattnificent,13,Mon Jun 8 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the first question: Is the entire party you're going to be playing with twisted as well? Unless you're doing a full on ""evil mages"" style alternate campaign, the correct thing for your allies to do upon discovering you're a toxic mage is put a bullet through your head, because toxic magic is Bad News(tm).  Alternately, I read about a build once where the backstory involved a mage with an Insect/Hornet Spirit Mentor forced upon her, and her great roleplaying opportunity/challenge was trying to hide that from everyone else. And not just hide it and go be an insect mage - cure herself of it. She wanted nothing more than to rid herself of this evil force trying to control her magic, and she couldn't tell a soul lest they put a bullet through her head, because insect magic is Bad News(tm).  So you could do a PC toxic mage with the right backstory. Maybe someone who was born into a highly polluted area and was corrupted by mages there, and soon after realized that Toxic Magic is Bad News(tm) and is trying to purify himself. However, this means you won't be taking any of the stuff out of the ""Dark Magic"" section of the book - summoning a great form Toxic Spirit (or a toxic spirit of any kind) would be a great way to get yourself killed.  Spirit Bane - Water/Earth might be a good place to start with the qualities. Your very existence abhors them, despite your best attempt to make amends.  Radiation Sponge is also probably a good quality choice, if you're going to be irradiating things. Though you might want to save irradiating things for a last resort, lest you kill your party members and/or take a bullet through the head.  There are a number of spells around cleaning up toxins and removing pollution from an area. Grab one or two of those, so when your character does dip into his toxic/radiation/acid powers he developed as a youth he at least has the courtesy to feel guilty about it and clean up after himself.  EDIT: Thanks for the Flair!(?)"

I give my Awakened characters a natural rebellious streak--and my head canon says this is why there are so many Awakened in the shadows, they feel that the world is wrong and they're not fitting in with the Sixth World.  I'd build one on the cusp of becoming a full Toxic Mage. Maybe their Mentor Spirit has been leading them to start fighting back against corruption and pollution. The day-to-day life, the trudge through acid rain, the murder and violence, it should be more than enough to turn someone in tune to all of that crazy.  I'd make him a mockery of what an upstanding Mage would look like. He'd wear an expensive suit, made from different styles and brands. His intimate knowledge of how people work makes him a decent Face, albeit a snide one who is contemptuous of just about everything.  He devotes a lot of time outside of running to pursue his own interests. His crusade against pollution now draws him to those places to draw power from them. A toxic spill site he sometimes protests at, a recent one, has become an invigorating place for him. He may think it's because he's in tune with the protestors, but it's the site itself."

You could maybe make them a mundane with the 'magical potential' edge, since I don't think you can regain magic use once it drops to zero."

Shadowrun,392yuf,Bamce,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:14:29 2015 UTC,"They might not have had a choice. Growing up awakened in a really polluted area might have made them comfortable around radiation, the way someone that grew up in the forest might be at ease in a wooded area. It would only be natural for them to want to use what they are familiar with when trying to survive in the shadows.    For combat spells I suggest radiation beam and burst as your bread and butter spells (Street Grimoire p. 105). These allow you to deal all the damage you need to biological targets. They don't do well against targets that have radiation protection on their armor and Street Grimoire doesn't mention what happens when used against machines.    As for mentor spirits, it really comes down to your character. If you like being toxic and want to follow the path of madness, Street Grimoire p.86 lists out the toxic mentor spirits. If I had to pick one of these I'd go with either Doom (+ to combat spells) or mutation (+ to health spells) depending on how I made the background story. Doom seeks to bring an end to all life, followers tend to be nihilistic and anti-social. Mutation is the changer of ways, its followers have a weird obsession with self-improvement and bettering themselves. If you don't want a toxic spirit, you could roll with any of the normal spirits if you're good at RP/writing. Taking on someone with a hard upbringing that wants a better life sounds like something Fire-Bringer would be all over. While Dog might have been your mentor spirit before going toxic and is simply to loyal to quit you.    Initiation is sadly something I simply can't help with much. Maybe a pilgrimage to an area where radiation has caused a lot of damage, like Chernobyl. There they would learn first hand what radiation can do to the world and revile/revel in it depending on if you want to help or harm. There they might commune with the twisted spirits and drink in the polluted mana. Hope this helps."

Add that on top of the fact that he needs two whole skill groups just to effective at his job while most other archetypes need one or less, skills/stats become a high priority.

Shadowrun,3922q7,BitRunr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:02:33 2015 UTC,Look at the prices of augmentations. Your deck determines your limits and how many programs you can run which can also influence your dice pools. A gun is to a Sam as a Program is to a Decker.
Shadowrun,3922q7,Beaumis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:33:35 2015 UTC,"augs have skyrocketed in price as well, which is a whole 'nother problem.    A gun also influences your limits and its addons (eg smartgun/link, scope etc) influence your dice pools. Making them very similar to the function of a deck in terms of ""getting things done"". Yes there is other ware that does other things, no analogy is perfect, but very little of that is mandatory, except maybe wired reflexes/synaptic boosters. Not to mention Deckers can and should make use of cerebral boosters and synaptic boosters as well.  I think the problem arises in that people compare the cost of being a fully tricked out sam with augs out the ass and a decker with a low end deck, and think it's fair. When in truth a basic Sam, with some wired reflexes 1 and a couple guns is effective at his job for well under 100,000 nuyen while having a limit of 5-6, While a basic Decker would need to spend 200,000+ just for the deck to give him that 6, or 100,000+ to give him the 5. lump on wired reflexes so he's not a sitting duck in meatspace for another 50k.  Just to be effective, a sam needs armor, gun, and some basic 'ware. A Decker needs a Deck and some basic 'ware, and is expected to also have armor and a gun. Decker is MUCH more expensive in that scenario. The Sam starts loading up on 'ware and he quickly catches up and surpasses the decker in cost, but in order for the decker to reach the same power level he needs something like the Fairlight Excalibur, meaning he's spent likely over a million nuyen on decks alone. A million Nuyen in 'ware gets you pretty damn far.  tl;dr a sam and a decker are comparable in cost at certain power levels after making certain choices, but at baseline the decker is much more expensive."
Shadowrun,3922q7,TaeoG,2,Tue Jun 9 08:41:45 2015 UTC,"The limits mean vastly different things for Deckers and Sams. The best cyberdeck in the world has a condition monitor of 12. That's where decent Sam's Condition Monitor starts. To ""kill"" a deck in the matrix you never need more than 12 points. To kill a person can mean anything between 9 and ~20ish points. Comparing matrix limits to accuracy is to compare apples and oranges. You need to compare what the numbers actually mean, not just the value. All matrix numbers are lower by design. Augmentations have the additional opportunity cost of essence. The ""basic"" wired reflexes II cost you half your essence pool. That's 50% of a non replentishable resource just to be able to actually do your job properly. If you want to reduce these costs, you have to multiply the monetary costs. Your complaint about the 800k Fairlight Excalibur looks different when you compare it to the 550k and 2.5 Essence Delta Wired Reflexes III. Sure, it's less money, but it's still ~41% of your Essence. That basic ware the Sam needs is not so basic. People just say that because they refuse to play any character without that same basic ware. Deckers don't need meatspace bosters because, in terms of flavor, they aren't supposed to deal with meatspace threats. A Decker needs nothing except for a datajack.   Your baseline comparison seems off because you apply different standards."
Shadowrun,3922q7,Beaumis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:50:56 2015 UTC,"yes its true matrix numbers are lower, and this is accounted for by the fact that the limit also counts as the DV. Lets say for sake of argument a person's damage track is on average 50% longer than a matrix condition monitor, as devices range from 9-12 and people from 9-20. A renraku Tsurugi at a DV and accuracy of 6 costs 200k. An FN HAR at accuracy 6 and a DV of 10 (to compensate for the longer tracks), costs 1.5k. Devices typically have a smaller soak pool, but guns typically have AP and lots of options to increase AP for cheap Essence is more of a limiting factor, not a ""cost"". I'm not sure how it applies in this situation. Unless you take into account that you can go for Deltaware and such to attempt to get as much out of your essence as possible, and that's where Sams outcost Deckers hand over fist. However another archetype having a hard time doesn't mean deckers don't too.  A Decker needs nothing except for a datajack.    unless he ever has to look at the business end of a gun, which invariably he will. Having at least 1 extra Initiative die would be very helpful, and it still helps him matrix side, so there is your Wireless reflexes 1. Also, Cerebral booster for Logic is just as much a requisite for a decker as Agility boosters for a StreetSam. IC and Spiders can throw fistfuls of dice just like a corpsec, even if the numbers are lower.   If we're talking about a baseline as in ""what does a character absolutely NEED to do his job"", then Sams need a gun and a jacket and Deckers need a deck. That's even less meaningful then the baseline I gave that included things to keep both from getting steamrolled by more competent versions of their archetype. Wireless reflexes 2 definitely evens the playing field between deckers and sams, this is true, although its not a hard requirement. But like I said, this is not a sign that things are on par, only that Cyberware is almost as ridiculously priced as decks. Wired Reflexes 2 used to cost 32k, and it gave a more reliable benefit than it does now at 178k. If the Tsurugi cost 32k or even 75k I wouldn't bat an eye.  It seems pretty clear to me that starting money was increased and costs were increased, to allow people to start around the same power level as 4e but have a significantly harder time advancing. I don't see the benefit in this."

I never said a decker needed maxed agility and Wired Reflexes 3. I said he, like everyone else, needs a boost to initiative to keep from getting wasted in meat space and more importantly to give him an edge in the matrix.

You wouldn't be the first GM to realize that your players actually hate being weak like that. New Runner doesn't mean less competent. It means less experienced at running the shadows . A former soldier going on his first run will still be better at shooting stuff than most experienced runners. In fact, most people enter the shadows because their skillset lends itself to shadowrunning. Its not a ""learning by doing"" profession. Those who don't rate usually die off quickly. Games that limit power like that severely empower awakened characters and weaken technology based characters, especially deckers. This is much more true in 4th than it is in 5th edition, and it's still bad in 5th edition. Make sure your players know this because it will mean that some characters will constantly outshine others.

Instead of walking into a gunfight and just slugging it out, you'll use skills and contacts to get into a superior position overall, making the fight easier.  Careful here, some of this will depend on your GM. Make sure you understand his style and if he'll appreciate you trying to circumvent the worst of combat. Less experienced GMs will just shrug and dump you into hard combat anyway, and you'll not have fun that way."

At minimum you'll need an Agility booster and an Initiative Dice booster. +1d6 won't cut it for a Street Sam, but if you have a high Reaction and Intuition you could get away with only two phases.  However, that'll cut into your Dodge pool. Also, Cyberlimbs add Armour that stacks with everything. If you get Cyberlimbs, even partials, you can get armour. But it gets costly.   You may also want Orthoskin and Bone Lacing or Density. Sams get shot at a lot, it's somewhat part of their role as being the most threatening thing out there.

The question is at what point is it an addiction and what point is it a compulsion, which is largely a character question. Actual compulsive behaviors versus addictive behaviors tend to be broken up with 'does this have a pleasure component' -- if yes, it's an addictive behavior, if no, it's a compulsive behavior, but this isn't a hard and fast rule, as some compulsions can grow to feel good for people who live with them.  Other important psychological questions often revolve around why the character engages in the behavior, as compulsions tend to have a fear of punishment behind them-- rationally or otherwise."

Party performing a heist at the docks? Rather than help with drone support, the rigger's too busy modding the getaway boat to go faster with his Nautical Engineering skill. Time to go? He guns it and pulls away from the dock as quickly as possible, nearly leaving two party members behind because theyr'e ""too slow"".

Taylor Swifts music is more fun watched than listened to because she's a good actor, the videos have great production values, but the music itself tends to be repetitive.

We loved it for its madness but fancied trying a more substantial rpg, especially as I had to simplify a lot of the rules to let us play with more players/while drinking heavily.  I then GMed D&D 4E (chosen because it was the newest D&D edition at the time, and wrongly we assumed the most streamlined/fun), but it was very very bad. It was alright to play overall (though it took my players a while to realise it was nothing like paranoia, there weren't booby traps and tricks awaiting everything that looks innocent - they spent about 15 minutes in the first session making sure a cable car like machine was safe to use, despite me intending it to just be a minor descriptive element) but we hated combat as it dragged on for hours (literally). Every unit had so much health and dealt relatively little damage that it became more of a battle miniatures game for a few elite units than an rpg.  So I looked for an rpg with a lethal (and thus much faster) combat system and discovered shadowrun, they'd just released 4E's anniversary edition and combat was only supposed to last 1 or 2 rounds thanks to everyone being a glasscannon.

Shadowrun,38zlnq,BLTnetwork,2,Tue Jun 9 05:32:07 2015 UTC,"As a young and impressionable child let loose in a comic book shop (now sadly closed) while my parents ate lunch with my grandmother I discovered a small brown book shelf in the back near some tables. Thumbing through the books was pretty mind blowing because they were all about creating games and stories using a framework of pre-written rules. As I had started programming at a fairly young age - first grade - references in some of the books to cybertechnology, computers, and such were fascinating and attractive to me (who wouldn't want a computer in their brain that let them connect to other computers and people?!). So my real introduction was reading RPG books, writing stories, and occasionally tricking friends into trying out these crazy imagination games - based on the stories I had written - involving weird dice, lots of paper, and flailing arms.  A number of trips to the comic store led to a small collection of roleplaying books. After having seen me almost monthly for several years the owner came over, put Shadowrun in front of me, and told me that it looked like something I'd be interested in so he saved me a copy. One of my favorite games before Shadowrun was Ninjas and Superspies - I was 8 of course it was - so I was immediately drawn into it.  Eventually I tricked friends into playing what were essentially James Bondy, detective noir, steal the MacGuffin, murder box scenarios. With various success and failure."

Then discovered the Battletech books (and eventually the game), and was intrigued.  The summer before I started high school, I got involved in a game of AD&D.  (not second edition... and I still remember most of that character's stats.)    End of that school year, we were headed to the ""local"" amusement park, and someone had the hardback edition with the Elmore cover (yes, first edition).  I read it in the back of the car while everybody else talked... and I've been hooked since then.  I did play later editions of D&D, Battletech, battlelords, much of White Wolf, one session of Robotech, and a couple other various small stuff... Was DM/GM for a couple of those, but couldn't find people locally to play Shadowrun with.  Now, I GM occasional games on the 'Hub, and play when I can.  (And still can't find people locally.

Shadowrun,38yz8x,DuKes0mE,10,Mon Jun 8 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"I play a toxic mage. My character's name is Eugene Spittler. He's a nobody. Public school, never went to any higher education, no friends, bit of a wierdo. Ended up doing city-wide sanitation. He takes out trash, is all.  Eugene has been at it for years. He had a steady income, a legit national UCAS SIN, and started getting to know people around Seattle. Obviously, they'd treat him like...well, like a garbage man. A janitor. A nobody. He'd show up at a corporate building and get clearance to come pick up their dumpsters.  One day, a man from Evo offered him some money to make sure he'd pick up an extra container off the books. Leave it off the record, just pick it up and dump it with everything else. If he was to keep his mouth shut and help make Evo's dirty little secrets disappear, there's more nuyen where that came from.  So he did. And then S-K got wind of it, so they started paying him too. And Renraku. And Mitsuhama. He became popular. People were paying attention to him. He had a guy waiting for him at every big-time trash pickup of his route with a smile on their face and a credstick in their hand. To Eugene, it was about feeling important. Being somebody. Having responsibility above his job.  Until Eugene started getting sick. He'd been handling secret wastes from some major players here, and it started getting to him. He started getting paranoid at everyone, a side effect of prolonged exposure to whatever the hell was in those crates.   So Eugene cracked. He started dumping these secret wastes on beaches, in sewers, and in old abandoned buildings in the Barrens. But, like any secret buried away, someone found them. His division was on lockdown, and Eugene was a prime suspect. Eugene started breaking down, eventually getting kicked out of his shitty apartment block because his neighbors couldn't stand the constant ramblings throughout the night, the sounds of his screams and rants at what Eugene thought were his own demons out to get him.  He had to move in with his mother. An old woman who could barely support herself, now looking out for his baby. She was concerned for her son, and wanted to make sure he was taken care of. She would secretly cry to herself when Eugene would leave big messes around the house, slowly getting dirtier and dirtier, slowly falling apart and taking less and less care of himself. But his mother would be there to clean it up after him, like she did when he was a child. He'd make it messy, she'd clean it up. He'd make it messy, and she'd clean it up. That pattern went on for months, and every day, she'd shed tears at the sight of her only son slowly slipping away from her.  Until one day, that stopped. Eugene came home, there was still a mess. A mess he found some sort of sick comfort in. And his mother would sit there, on her big chair, staring at the trideo. He'd go into his room, rant at himself all night, go back into his 20 year old clunker car, make his rounds at work, then come back and do it all over again. And there was his mom, sitting with that blank stare. He'd almost forgotten the color of her eyes if they weren't sitting there glued to the trideo.  Eugene was in his room when there was a knock on the door. As he got up to answer it, it crashed open as Knight Errant charged in and tackled him to the ground. His mother was just sitting there on the couch, and no one seemed to notice. That is, until he was dragged outside, kicking and screaming. His neighbors looking on, shocked looks on their faces, some with tears in their eyes, all staring at Eugene. A Knight Errant agent stepped towards Eugene, disgusted look on his face as he put a handkerchief to his face to filter the disgusting smell that had overtaken the house.   ""Eugene Spittler, you're under arrest for the murder of your mother Janice Spittler.""  Eugene looked inside. There she was, sitting. This time, looking right at him. Eugene looked to the side of the house, and there also was his mother, dirty and naked, being pulled from a shallow grave of trash piled on the side of the house. Looking back at his mother inside, something had taken her place. Something that looked like her, but wasn't her. The image of his mother had boils, seeping lesions, and open sores along it's skin.   Eugene wasn't in the right state of mind. It was all a blur. He was in jail, and he was in court. He was at home, and he was in an interrogation room with a homicide detective. He was at work, and he was standing in his room, shouting at himself. ""You summoned that spirit to kill your mother, didn't you?"" the detective would say. Eugene was standing on a rooftop, looking down at Seattle. ""Tell me what you know about this pollution spirit, now!"" someone would yell. Eugene was sitting in a jail cell. ""This man doesn't know what's happening. He's clearly in a fugue state, and you clearly have no evidence to conclude that my client had any direct involvement on the murder of his mother,"" some voice would say.  And then, Eugene was at home. He stood there, looking at this...thing, sitting there. Looking like his mother. This thing that sat in filth, looking at Eugene, and smiling. This thing that suddenly spoke, with a raspy voice, ""Youuu....make....myyy....hooommmmeee....""  /scene  Basically, Eugene started getting attuned to pollution auras over time. Eventually, he'd start setting the stage for the home of a Pollution Mentor Spirit by subconsciously trashing his home. Eugene doesn't understand magic, he just knows that he can somehow control it, somehow produce it, and that he can pull from the aether toxic spirits. The mentor spirit saw this habitat at his home, but it would keep being cleaned up by his mother. Once it found a way through, it killed his mother and got rid of the body, so that this...""nest"" would grow, and Eugene it's catalyst."
Shadowrun,38yz8x,xippilli,5,Mon Jun 8 02:53:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was hoping for a story like this. Makes me wonder though, if he became a runner before or after that spirit incident."
Shadowrun,38yz8x,xippilli,6,Mon Jun 8 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"After.  Eugene remembers a few things from his time in that fugue state. He remembers those guys who were paying him to take out other trash calling him and yelling ""You really hosed this one up, squat!""  Eugene is a dwarf. He doesn't remember much, but he started calling himself Squathose. Yeah, I know, it's the nastiest name I could think up.  Anyway, some fixer looks for some mage talent, finds this news on the trids, finds Eugene, and offers him revenge towards the corps for killing his mother. So he takes it.  He now lives out of his car and rents an old section of caged-off sewer tunnel from some ghouls to store his toxic magical lodge, as well as experiment with homebrew explosives (From Run & Gun), and various chemical weapons."
Shadowrun,38yz8x,lordhellion,3,Mon Jun 8 03:22:40 2015 UTC,"Have an aquatic changeling: gills, webbed hands, Sea mentor spirit, etc. Took an Ordeal to aid my karma burn, and ended up having to fast at the bottom of Puget Sound for 72 hours. The lack of air was no problem, so the temperature and hunger were the physical stresses I had to endure.  Crit glitched the endurance roll. Ended up in the hospital a week for hypothermia. Got out, tried again, crit glitched again. Another week in the hospital shivering. Tried again, succeeded, decided the fairest post-ordeal impairment was nictophobia--fear of the dark--from being stuck at the bottom of the sound for so long.  Shortly afterwards, my character made a charity donation to the hospital's hypothermia ward."
Shadowrun,38yz8x,Trickybiz,5,Mon Jun 8 04:20:17 2015 UTC,"From a GM's point of view Mages are easy to create an initiatory ordeal. The dweller should be something nasty from their past that forces them to confront the harsh reality of why they are running. They either beat it or they gain some new disadvantage or don't get to initiate again until they beat the dweller.   Adepts are harder. Traditionally I have set my adepts up to demonstrate mastery of their art. Phys ads usually defeating a martial arts master (usually in a fair combat), Gun slinger adepts winning a shooting comp against seasoned professionals, and so on.  From a player standpoint the neatest initiation I ever went through was my amer-ind who went on a spirit journey with his totem wolf. Almost wound up with a peyote addiction."
Shadowrun,38yz8x,marwynn,4,Mon Jun 8 01:48:37 2015 UTC,"I had a smuggler Mystic Adept with a cyberarm in SR4A. There's a lot of choices that would lead a normal Awakened person down that path, and a lot of regrets that pile up.   Since MysAds can't Astrally Project all of his Initiations were in the meat, sometimes astrally perceiving but usually it was working through a lot of the backstory I wrote for him.  The first one for him was, since he was a Chaos Magician, writing down the sum of his magical knowledge. Seeing as how he started running before he could graduate, to pay the bills, it seemed fitting for him to finally earn that ThD in his own way. It culminated in tracking down some Thaumaturgy professors for some sort of validation--but he realized he'll never earn any academic praise for his insights into Magic.   His first Initiation cost him the hope of ever being recognized as a great Magician, at least by the public, and that his knowledge, while rare and very much in demand in the shadows, would never really make his name known.  It shattered him, really. The next run I barely cast any spells, I think I only cast Improved Invisibility, and shot people in the face with gel rounds.   Then, the next Initiation--I had been saving karma for it--happened three months later. Doubt has seeped in despite his Magic becoming stronger (Rating 6 again). Had to confront why he lost his arm, why he became a smuggler, and being almost literally haunted by the ghosts of those actions.  I got him to Initiate Grade 3 after about a year of gaming. We ended the game, and my epilogue that I wrote for him uses the nuyen I had saved up to pay for a cloned arm. It's not going to restore the Essence, but he's ""whole"" again. He also started his own school, teaching the SINless Awakened what he can.  He's come to terms with the fact that while life dealt him some bad hands his choices made things worse for him. He's... less human now too, I don't mean Essence-wise. He's comfortable with what he's done and has put away guilt and regret bit by bit. He wants knowledge and wants to be acknowledged. So there's more than a hint of danger. My GM at the time thought that I was setting him up to be a future bad guy since he could be training some guys to further his agenda."
Shadowrun,38yz8x,felicidefangfan,2,Mon Jun 8 04:46:43 2015 UTC,How did your GM communicate the first initiation cost (that you wouldn't be recognized)? Or did your gm simply have you hunt down the prof. and you came up with the rest of it?
Shadowrun,38yz8x,marwynn,2,Mon Jun 8 05:08:53 2015 UTC,"I actually came up with most of it as background stuff. Then he just used that as a base, saying that one prof had been discredited and was in the shadows like I was. One had earned tenure and another had been extracted to a manatech corp. Tracked down all three to pass along my Opus. The one in the shadows did like it, but then tried to held it over him saying that he'd destroy it if I didn't cooperate.  I was like ""Bro, that's a digital file. I'm a Chaos Mage, remember? We're cool with tech."" So he deletes a copy, the original's safely stored somewhere else. Ended up dueling him magically, but he was a burnout and it wasn't much fun. I let him live.  The tenured professor was the most welcoming and supportive. She scoffed at the idea of my re-entering academia, however. The third professor I met over real coffee after giving him a copy. He wanted to hire me.   They all recognized my character's prowess and power. Few academic magicians are battle tested after all. And I had written a few spells myself. Not many ""Destroy Pants"" spells floating around in the Aethernet...  As for communicating the actual cost, it came out through conversations with the professors. They were all dismissive. This was all based on my character's need for approval, to live up to the rest of his peers who had corporate sponsorships or scholarships here and there and I had written that my character had messed those up earlier."
Shadowrun,38yz8x,felicidefangfan,2,Mon Jun 8 13:25:14 2015 UTC,"Well the simple answer to multiple initiations is either: focusing their life on magic and/or living a long life. An npc might take 10 years to earn enough karma to initiate and then spend all of it on initiation.   As for dragons and their initiations, they've been around forever (almost literally), each shadowrun ""world""  lasts about 5200 years, and dragons have been around since the 2nd world (if i recall correctly, certainly since the 4th world).  Though my player's mage hasn't initiated yet, I plan on using the idea of ASCETICISM from street grimoire (page 141). For 1 month of in game play time (so 3-4 sessions most likely) he cannot use technology aside from basic tools (no commlink to communicate with his crew, no vehicles to move around the city, no firearms for defense when he's all drained out) and no magical conviences in that time (no spirits, foci or fetishes allowed). As part of the ordeal, he must also perform 6 (current magic rating) different skill tests or the initiation fails."

After a few, ah, ""enhanced interrogation"" sessions, my GM latched onto the darker side of the character. When Jakob first tried a sample of deepweed, he found the cute black cat that served as his spirit guide had a much more Lovecraftian appearance on the astral plane.  A few plot threads in the campaign came to a head while investigating some kidnappings in the sewers. After an encounter with a particularly horrific spirit sent the party scattering, Jakob got lost and stumbled upon the cultists and their ritual. He could have tried to fight them alone, but his spirit mentor had... other ideas.  Here's your story. I had way too much fun writing it up.  The end result was one discounted initiation (the ""suffering"" rite, borrowed from 4e), with an upgrade from mild to severe insomnia."

Shadowrun,38zvot,felicidefangfan,2,Wed Jun 10 11:09:46 2015 UTC,"You mean in 5th Edition?  You may as well be asking for the Earth to stop revolving around the Sun.  Editing jokes aside, there's a fundamental problem with your request.  The rules give guidelines on how to use equipment, skills, powers and attributes together to provide a fair ruling.  However, the actual use is a GM call for each instance, based on the situation.  The biggest example is replacing physical stats with mental stats while in the Matrix or while Astral.  There are examples where a device roll is replaced by skill + attribute.  Skillsofts specifically say that you can still use them as knowledge skills if you only have the chipjack.    Your best bet is to get a fundamental understanding of what each of the attributes is.  Then get a good understanding of how they interact with skills.  Then get a good understanding of how to break those rules.    Let's take a pistol as an example.     Shooting it will generally be Pistols + Agility [Accuracy] test. If it jams, that might be a Pistols + Logic [Mental] test (likely only a 1 threshold) to clear it. If you spot a hidden pistol on someone, you could probably do a Pistols + Intuition [Mental OR Device Rating] test to identify it.  Similarly, you could do the same to identify the caliber of weapon used to shoot someone.  Or even recognize a gunshot from sound.   I'm a little hard pressed to make a connection to body or strength, other than recoil compensation.   I think willpower might function with regards to not peeing yourself when faced against a pistol pointed at your head.     The point is that attributes can be applied differently depending on the situation and having a good understanding of what they are will make those judgement calls quicker."
Shadowrun,38zvot,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:29:43 2015 UTC,"Yes. By the fact that it is a roleplaying game the GM always has the right to overrule the rules and make attribute calls as he sees fit.

I mean anybody can have the rough impressions from having read that content but a list certainly helps alot. I have read through the core rulebook and I could still only put together an extremely rough list from memory."

Looking up stuff like firemodes, actions, modifiers and so on takes up most of the time at the beginning. It will still take longer than a DnD fight, but it will get quicker. You will also start picking up some tricks, like for example none of my players could remember their defense pool most of the time, until I told them that it is in most situations their initiative number without the diceroll.   If that is still not enough, you can start houseruling things. Our group prefers a combat that flows faster, so we started removing GM rolls as much as possible. Grunts are just walking thresholds now, if my players beat number X with their hits, they hit the target instead of determining X with an opposing roll. You can also give grunts an instakill value, for example if the damage beats their modifed body + armor by a factor of 2, dont even roll for soak and just let them die. Also don`t forget that grunts with a lot of physical damage are likely to run away or giving up instead of fighting to their end.   Organizing your stats and your players stats plays also a huge part in it. Character cheat sheets are a great idea, also every player should write down stuff they are going to use in combat, like the effect of various grenades, toxins, drungs, ammo, cyberware and so on before the session starts."

Shadowrun,38yisz,iForkyou,3,Mon Jun 8 13:43:30 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're missing something important here-   I take stun damage equal to their hits in step 2 - my hits in step 4   The damage taken, as well as the type of damage, is determined by the weapon used. Let's assume you're using the AK-97 for that full-auto burst. The damage would be 10 (physical), plus the net hits on the Weapon+agility vs. Rea+int test. (let's say the attacker got 2 net hits)   This damage is then resisted using the test in step 4, and all hits from this (armor-ap)+body test subtract from the 12 and whatever's left over is how much damage you take."

But since you were, i think it's just a matter of getting used to the system. Make sure everyone knows the types of rolls they'll be doing often during combat (weapon attack roll, dodge roll, soak roll). Once you guys get the hang of it things will go a lot smoother."
Shadowrun,38yisz,OverlyWaxedMustache,2,Mon Jun 8 03:35:57 2015 UTC,"Having them make a cheatsheet would be the easiest way to speed it up, another alternative if you've enough table space and die is for them to have their combat dice pools set aside so they can just grab and roll.  The Big 3 you need are:  Attack (Weapon Skill+AGI+Gear-Situational modifiers)  Dodge(Reaction+Intuition-Modifiers)  Soak(Body+Armor)  The differing dice pools can be confusing at first, but as you go more and more it's pretty easy to get used too. As for the very few combat turns, That's rather common as it's meant to be visceral and deadly. High initiative scores means a one character can kill 2-3(usually mooks) pending dice pools in a single combat turn (3 seconds).  Drones have 3 Ways to be controlled:  1) Autopilot: You give them an order (simple action) and they use their pilot+relevant autosoft to perform it on their action phase (Drones have their own initiative score of 2xDR+4d6) With an RCC You can use one simple action to give the same command to all (or less) slaved drones with a single simple action.  2) Remote control: Complex Action, You roll Log(I think?)+Skill  3) Jumped in, same as jumping into a vehicle"

Shadowrun,38yisz,garner_adam,2,Sun Jun 7 23:18:15 2015 UTC,My core group just couldn't get faster even after six months. In the end I started having all the NPCs use buying hitsp.45 in combat and it sped things up dramatically. Just understand that one side should still be rolling.
Shadowrun,38yisz,ElevatedUser,2,Mon Jun 8 00:03:40 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that buying hits lowers the average amount of hits NPC's get (significantly!). If you're okay with that, sure (you're the GM, you can compensate anyway). But making them buy hits 3:1 might be better if you want to keep them challenging."
Shadowrun,38yisz,garner_adam,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:58:46 2015 UTC,This isn't quite true here's a chart showing various probabilities.  You'll notice that with every four dice it hits the 80% probability for a hit. If you go with the 3:1 interpretation which per the chart is usually just a riding between 58% - 65% then the NPCs will functionally be getting an extra hit every round that statistically shows they'd normally get only every other round.  What I found made the biggest difference is that buying hits whether 3:1 or 4:1 just makes semi-auto and single shot useless for the grunts and mooks. They have to be compensating for a bit of recoil and use at least BF-long burst. Then they will be a very credible threat to the players.
Shadowrun,38yisz,ElevatedUser,2,Mon Jun 8 19:56:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm interesting counterpoint. For most of that chart, 4 dice per hits is about equal to when you'd get a 80% chance to hit that many hits.  Except that breaks down at high levels. But still, a very interesting argument for 4:1.  Still, 80% might be a good threshold for, well, threshold-based tests (that being when you're likely enough to hit the threshold to handwave it for speed purposes), but in combat, we're talking opposed hit - and there the small chance for upper hits should weigh in to the calculation. And then you do get the 'naïve' 1 hit per 3 on average. Which is part of my main problem with buying hits - it works well for thresholds, but not well at all for opposed tests."
Shadowrun,38yisz,garner_adam,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:13:48 2015 UTC,Well it mostly works excellent for crowds of grunts in opposed tests. They're easier to run and less unpredictable. Whereas with rolling your grunt could roll like hot cakes just once and drop a player with their light pistol that's less likely to happen now. I rolled for important NPCs in combat. But the vast majority of fights were with grunts and so I bought hits.   What's really interesting about buying hits is that you'll begin to see how extremely unlucky players can be. The number of times I've seen players completely flop an attack roll with twelve dice...   One of the oddities of buying hits 4:1 is that it doesn't play nice with SA-burst and BF-short burst. It also frequently doesn't play nice with small modifiers or light cover. This is where your argument really wins out. In general after all modifiers I would round up to the nearest hit. Rounding down absolutely destroyed NPCs. Rounding up was probably a bit too generous. So in the end I was actually playing in some strange land between 4:1 and 3:1.
Shadowrun,38yisz,SweRacoon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:16:50 2015 UTC,"I might try this, it would definitely speed it up a lot."
Shadowrun,38yisz,felicidefangfan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:08:18 2015 UTC,"Through The Breach had the idea that the GM never actually rolled (or flipped, as the case in TtB is). It really sped combat up, I might just take this idea for a spin next session."
Shadowrun,38yisz,felicidefangfan,2,Tue Jun 9 10:56:48 2015 UTC,"Our group came from D&D 4e so combat (even at first when unsure of the rules) seemed really fast comparatively, because in general combat is resolved within a couple of rounds.  I would recommend ignoring the ""is it still physical damage or is it now stun damage"" portion of combat until everyone has a handle on things (aka the comparison between DV + net hits vs Armor -AP), focus on attack roll, defense roll and then damage soak (if it hits).  Additionally Id simplify any mooks (random combat focused enemies) your team will be facing (rather than stat them up properly). This saves on both prep and working out how many dice you need on the fly. I tend to use a few basic levels and adjust them on the go.   Random basic npcs will roll 6 dice on all tests. They have a single damage track of 10 for all forms of damage. Some examples of who this could be: a secretary, a pedestrian on the street, anonymous wageslave.  Competent npcs will roll 9 dice. They have a single damage track of 12. Examples could be a ganger or a security guard new to the job this month.  Skilled npcs get 12 dice. They have a single damage track of 14. Examples could be a ganger lieutenant, or a security guard working at a high security facility.  Very skilled npcs get 15 dice. They have a single damage track of 16. Examples could be a nitroed up ork enforcer, corporate onsite tactical response units, a force 6 spirit.  HTR npcs (or their equivalent, spec ops units for example) will have 18+ dice depending on how skilled you want them, above 15 dice I would probably stat the characters."

Shadowrun,38xtuf,Kromgar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"So you've got a couple of choices to make here.  The first is Full Mage vs. Aspected. While an Aspected conjurer is the only decent kind of aspected mage to play(Because of the free spells on full magician being SO MUCH additional karma), even if you don't use spells yourself knowing them will make your Spirits of Man MUCH stronger because of their innate spell ability. I personally am of the opinion that Aspected Conjurers can learn spells they can never cast for that purpose, but your GM might disagree. Additionally a Full Magician can astrally project, which synergizes very well with commanding spirits to do things from far away.   Secondly, your tradition is super important for dedicated summoners. You mentioned Elf, so I'm assuming you want to play a Cha based caster. There's TONS of choices here, all depending on the RP flavor you want and on spirit choice(and possession vs. Manifestation, but since you didn't mention it I'm assuming Vodou Possession summoner is right out)  Check out this list right here, compiled by someone who is not me, https://www.dropbox.com/s/zidc5u3c5q2yoz9/SR5%20TOOL%20Magical%20Tradition%20List%2C%20Compiled.pdf?dl=0  If you play a full magician, I strongly suggest Shinto, Black Magic or Shamanism, since those have Spirits of Man which are crazy good Swiss Army Knives when you know lots of spells.  All in all, I'd probably go with E)Resources D)Elf C)Skills B)Attributes A)Magician(Shaman, skills should go to Summoning and either Binding, Assensing, or Astral Combat)  Make sure to buy Edge 2 or 3 with karma."
Shadowrun,38xtuf,PinkTrench,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:53:34 2015 UTC,Yeah wanted to go manifestation route.   I was thinking maybe Aspected because fluff wise I  want a character who cant cast spells
Shadowrun,38xtuf,PinkTrench,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:18:17 2015 UTC,"In that case you may with to go with Aboriginal Australian, Path of the Wheel(Super appropriate for an elf if you're from one of the Tir's), or Christian Theurgy. Guidance Spirits are very useful. Divination is a hos power.  In that case, I would probably go with E)Resources, D)Skills, C)Elf or Magic, B)Magic or Elf, A)Attributes. With that sort of situation though, it's sort of a fine tuning thing so it depends on what side lines you want.  I'd still suggest going full magician with the quality Incompetent(Sorcery) just for Astral Projection and spellcasting Spirits of Man, even without being able to cast the spells yourself but I get your choice."

Shadowrun,38wi55,Galdoba,2,Sun Jun 7 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"I had some ideas while reading Data Trails on how I as GM should treat ""I want my own Host"" thing, after all it would me great way to use Foundation as a part of the game. So I decided to use some home rules:   Host MUST be attached to some SIN. Registration of the Host for that will be rating 5 identity check ((SIN ratingx2) vs. 10 dice) --> I also use notoriety as a negative dice mode for player for identity checks. After this check is passed player will be charged for 50k nuyen and will receive Host rating 1 in his ownership. Host need some mantainance - just pointed as 30k nuyen per Host rating + 5k/10k/20k nuyen for any white/gray/black IC host have installed. Paid monthly as a part of lifestyle. Though I might change those numbers in a future. Player can grow/modify/change Host using rules in Data Trails. *note: if SIN player was using to registrate the Host was burned, Host will be consedered as a property of the corporation who sold it to player. Player may choose to use legal SIN to get the Host, but keep in mind of the tax for every incoming transaction (f.e. You need to pay for your Rating 3 Host with 2 White IC and 1 Gray IC (110k nuyen) but since you have state SIN it will cost you 122.223 nuyen to pay the bills (12.223 - will be the tax you will need to pay to pile up 110k nuyen on your SIN account)"
Shadowrun,38wi55,VoroSR,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:41:48 2015 UTC,"That's not how SIN checks work. It's Scanner Rating+Scanner Rating[Scanner Rating], or Rx2[R] shorthand, with a threshold of the SIN's rating. Unless you're just changing it entirely."

On the flip side data trails talks about how dangerous it is to go into a host's foundation, thus I would imagine host destruction is saved only for really important targets (so a low level mafia server not very likely to be anything more than monitored, whereas they might try and destroy a host identified as the main recruitment center for a large and dangerous digital terrorism group).  As for the test, it would likely be software+logic[mental] but I wouldn't be sure about whether its a threshold, extended or an opposed test (extended makes the most sense to me, with high numbers and long time intervals, threshold would be too easy and I couldn't think of what would be opposing your attempt in such an active way)"

As of the 5e Matrix at least, hosts are massively complex pieces of virtual infrastructure, used by (il)legitimate organisations across the globe to process all of the unfathomably-complex digital tasks they need processed in order to run their show. In short, a bit more grunty than your standard Transys Avalon plus-plus.   I start with this because I'm not quite sure what your average runner would do with a host of their own - its kind of like buying a skyscraper when you're just going to live on the penthouse floor; Virtually impossible, and asking for trouble. You can turn off a commlink and 'reboot' as a technomancer, but a host is always going to be there. Is what you'd do with a host of your own worth the risk of getting found? What could the data you leave in there be worth to an adversary? Information is power in the 2070s...  That said, runners and other ne'er-do-wells have totally have bought hosts in the fluff; Jackpoint, the Nexus and the Helix are all given as examples in Data Trails. The process of obtaining a host is mostly automated; ""You register online, pay, and shortly a host is made available to you"" (p. 85). Thing is, these are huge runner networks, not just one or two enthusiasts. In order to do this, these groups had to set up ""shell corps with falsified records to obtain the necessary credentials"". Probably a bit beyond you're average hacker. And considering how expensive a cyberdeck is in the de la Mar era of the Matrix, I don't want to know how expensive a host might be.  TL;DR: It's virtually impossible, and there are no rules.

Shadowrun,38wbk6,Shakyor,4,Sun Jun 7 11:10:05 2015 UTC,"basic chargen advice  Secondly, the block of text is a bit messy to understand  The Corporate sinner quality is always something that is horribly misunderstood. To begin with if runners find out you are a corp guy, There is a good bed that they will geek you and leave you for dead. Runners are not the most trustworthy people and when they find out you are working for ""the man"" They will often assume you are some form of spy. Secondly if your corp dumped you for whatever reason, a near impossibility given your strength of personality and magical power. They would have also revoked your corporate sinner status. In fact there is a good chance that if you left of your own accord they would have labeled you as some sort of criminal in order to find people to get you back.  With a squatter lifestyle you do not have access to proper bathing or food. There should be some solid social penalities applied here.  A R1 Fake sin is basically useless, as a sin scanner only has to have 1 hit to flag it as ""questionable"" any more than that and its burned.  Improved reflexes does not stack with attribute boost reaction, or adrenaline boost.   You would have to cast that increase charisma spell at F9 to get any use out of it.  Your main offensive option is stunbolt, which is.... questionable at best. Especially when you have no gun. You should at least carry one as the people who are unarmed are the most dangerous.  Mental manipulation magic is some of the most feared, and hated magic. It also most likely doesn't work like you think it does. When the spell is dropped they will probably know that someone cast upon them. and make the relevant security calls."
Shadowrun,38wbk6,Bamce,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:26:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, thank you for your advice!!!  But isn`t that exactly how it is written in the book? That the runner was on the way to greatness, being a huge financial trader, manager oder even special unit? And than something went horribly wrong, sending them in disgrace. (Dont have the book with me atm, but i am fairly certain on that)   The idea of people finding out and extreme hostility as a result is actually really appealing. It s actually also the reason for the fake 1 sins as well. Since the etiquette skill was descriped as social stealth, i figured i could use to fave them in front of the other runner, and secretly use my corporate sin at the checkpoints under the air of privacy. Of course getting a real fake sin is top priority, but he is broke since he had to flee. Does this not make sense in the world of shadowrun?  I actually would love to give him social penalties for him the hate ingame, untill he earns enough money to build a new life for himself.   Also i thought improved reflexes only wouldnt stack for initiative, but the attribute boost would still give me extra dodge dice? Is Adrenaline boost really not compatible, seems like its pretty useless then, since i imagine every adept atleast taking some improved reflexes. Well i guess i could maybe drop the two for enhanced perception? I really wanted that anyway....  Why do i have to cast it at F9, isnt F4 plenty to allow for the maximum augmentation bonus?  The main offensive was actually intentional. I do not like hogging all the spotlight. I thought it was very in character for a weasel like flynn to be used to other people taking care of his wet work. So i tried to design him as a chracter who is very very good at working around problems, not breaking through them. i figured in combat i could use stuff like chaotic world to soften up the opposition for my street sam. I thought stun bolt as sort of a last ressort, or for  being one on one with another guy during a party or something an quickly stunbolting him to sleep. You are right though, maybe i should get the cheap holdout pistol for 120.  I am fully aware that mental magic is dispiciple and like it for the charakter. In most covert situations i actually planned to talk my way to get the npcs to do my bidding. I thought the mental magic was more for combat, oder back to wall kind of situations. The mind probe maybe for a poor hostage or something. But i did understood the section that most security personel is specificially trained to recogince mind magic and have protocols how to react to it. But they do have to do my bidding for the duration of the spell if i had sucess right?"
Shadowrun,38wbk6,Bamce,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:22:07 2015 UTC,"exactly how it is written in the book   Maybe, just remember most shadowrunners don't last that long as it is a very dangerous business   extreme hostility as a result is actually really appealing   Be upfront with your gaming group about this. And I wonder how appealing it will be when they find out.   Since the etiquette skill was descriped as social stealth   Not sure what your looking to do there?   secretly use my corporate sin at the checkpoints   Sin's are broadcast out into the open. So your party members could just see it. ALSO anytime you use it for ANYTHING you are creating a paper trail. Your corp will easily be able to see where you went, what you bought, which competing brands you are prefering. And if they are looking for you. Where to find you.   social penalties for him the hate ingame,   Talk to your gm   improved reflexes   As per the book....   The maximum rating of Improved Reflexes is 3, and the increase cannot be combined with other technological or magical increases to Initiative.   pg 310  Adrenaline and attribute boost are both magical increases to initiative.    Why do i have to cast it at F9   Again, from the book....   The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the (augmented) value of the Attribute being affected   pg 288  With a base 9 charisma, needs to be force 9   But they do have to do my bidding for the duration of the spell if i had success right?   ""yes"" Remember that casting the spell is a complex action, unless you do it recklessly. That means that you have to wait until your next Initiative pass to give them an order. There is all kinds of things they can do before then. Also they get dice to begin knocking off hits from the spell itself to eventually break it."

Shadowrun,38vwt0,wcole01,3,Sun Jun 7 17:56:36 2015 UTC,In Germany they published some sourcebooks for 4th and 5th edition (it's officially for the 5th edition here in germany but the rules can be applied to the 4th edition as well). 2050 is one of them.  That is because the 4th edition came here pretty late so that the 5th edition came out at the same time.

Shadowrun,38vwt0,cyronius,2,Sun Jun 7 07:32:10 2015 UTC,Only one I have really seen coverage on. I am not aware of the differences.
Shadowrun,38vwt0,virpriscus,3,Sun Jun 7 07:46:38 2015 UTC,"I am not aware of the differences.   1st edition is nearly 30 years old.  The rules are kludgy, crunchy and hard to use.    If you played the game back when it came out, there's probably value in replaying it for nostalgia purposes, but if you've never played it before, you're much better off starting with 5th edition..."
Shadowrun,38vwt0,TaeoG,2,Sun Jun 7 09:28:33 2015 UTC,"Basically the differences are this:  First, Second and Third are basically the same ruleset with improvements working their way onward.  Lots of ""old school"" players, like myself, tend to play Third edition, even today.  Fourth and Fifth edition can be grouped together the same way, pretty much.  They streamline the math a bit when compared to earlier editions.  You can pick a school - old or new - and I would suggest getting the latest edition of that school.  If you like the idea of first edition Shadowrun, look at third edition rules.  It has the same feel as first edition with an additional ten rules of playtesting behind it."
Shadowrun,38vwt0,NotB0b,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:48:59 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""coverage""? 3e was seen as the definitive version for some time iirc, 4e 20th anniversary edition had a large following and is personally my favourite due to wireless matrix, technomancers and tonnes of interesting splats. There should be tonnes of videos of people playing those editions, although I'll admit I never looked. Also we're on 5th edition now, which is lukewarm but still usable and good for beginners. Especially since you're much likely going to find answers to questions about newer editions when you ask here.  Starting at 1st seems... odd. The books are long, long out of print, and I don't know if official PDFs were ever made but you could look for them, maybe drivethrurpg has them?

Do like bricking things though Honestly if a GM can't grok mixing the deckers actions with the rest of the group, Shadowrun isn't for them.   I laughed when I read Data Trails though. What could be accomplished in 4e with a simple extended roll interspersed among other things, now requires a pseudo metaplane journey. Bye bye 5e ""advantage"", lol. /rant"

I did not have that gm when I started.  I never played 4e, although I have a few books for it.  When 3 came out, I was frustrated that I couldn't find a table, so I never invested.  Books went onto shelves, and I looked for other things.  (Family was part of that.)  Now 5 is out, and I have the opportunity to get back in.

Shadowrun,38v610,sinkocto,3,Sun Jun 7 02:33:45 2015 UTC,We have been running 2050 in 5th edition with the german rerelase of shadowrun 2050 for the fifth edition. But we very much ignore the bloated matrix rules and use a simplified and limited version of the 5th edition matrix that ignores any wireless stuff.
Shadowrun,38v610,iForkyou,3,Sun Jun 7 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"Can you give me a brief description on how you use the rules?   Here's how I'm thinking I'll use them: 1st Edition node: CPU-1: Red-7, Black IC 8  5th Edition node: CPU-1: Red, Black IC 8 The color will denote the threshold for doing matrix actions that the particular node can execute. In this case Red, a threshold of 5. The IC will keep it's rating that acts as a Device Rating. So, in this system, the Black IC will use x2 it's rating as an attack pool.   I'm still coming up with this stuff so nothing has been set."
Shadowrun,38v610,iForkyou,3,Sun Jun 7 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, so we are using simplified matrix rules that I posted a while ago here to speed things up (but we have modified the system quite a lot since then, but it is still tresholds instead of opposed tests). Everything else is normal 5th edition hacking / cybercombat, nodes behave like hosts that launch ICs the same way that hosts do now and noise rating prevents any kind of super long range hacking. It is not very innovative or represents the 1st edition matrix rules really well, but it is fast and flows nicely. No one in my group is especially interested in minigaming the matrix, so we kinda figure out what works for us live on the table and break RAW frequently to create a more ""cinematic"" hacking experience. Most of our 2050 matrix experience is about describing how the node looks and behaves and the player doing the same for his character, role playing the matrix, while we keep dicerolls to a minimum."
Shadowrun,38v610,WizardWolf,2,Sun Jun 7 23:19:55 2015 UTC,Would you be able to share any of these when you're done? I'd love to play in the 2050 setting with 5th edition rules. If I can at least get an idea of how you're doing the conversions I can try my hand at converting some of my own. I've always wanted to run the Shutdown
Shadowrun,38v610,dethstrobe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:28:52 2015 UTC,Maybe it suppose to be the firewall?  Reds the highest before you hit UV right? What's Red? like a 7?
Shadowrun,38v610,justablur,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:50:06 2015 UTC,"For 1e, Red's Threshold is 3, Orange's is 2, Green's & Blue's are 1.  Ratings are the target numbers, thresholds are based on the color. Thresholds are the minimum number of successes you have to get before you can do anything else so, for a red node, 2 successes get scrapped out of your resulting successes just to overcome the security threshold. So, if you wanted to run Analyze 5 in the CPU (Red, 7), you'd roll 5 with a target number of 7 (c'mon sixes!) and have to get 3 net successes to get the basic info. The node resists with 7 dice with a target number of your deck's Sensor rating. Any successes over 3 can be allocated for extra info at GM's discretion."

So give an ultimatum, and tie it into the character's story in a way that the other runners can have a good time with. Or bounty hunters if all else fails."
Shadowrun,38tlxo,Dallico,2,Sun Jun 7 01:09:15 2015 UTC,"As a GM myself I agree with how one of my friends deals with flakers. In one of his pathfinder games he has a player like this. He used to be deeply important to the story before he started flaking. Missing one game quickly became missing two or three. Eventually they talked, and he continued to miss. When this continued to happen he cut them out of the story, cause its not like they're going to be around to witness it anyways.   If I were you I'd focus on the players who show up to your games first and foremost, and maybe consider his role in the process, but don't make him extremely important to anything if he's likely not going to show up."

So if I am GMing a game, and a player is not taking it seriously, at all, I will simply warn them that this game is intended for people that can make the schedule, or at least provide warning ahead of time so that we can plan around issues.  If they can't do that at least, there is another 20+ players waiting in line for their place in the game."

If no decker then maybe they hire an npc or their face can loan them an agent+deck to handle hacking for them. No combatant (samurai, gunbunny or adept) is easy enough, the team just goes stealthy.

Shadowrun,38sgt2,IAmMattnificent,5,Sat Jun 6 12:35:57 2015 UTC,"Data Trails is honestly pretty disappointing if you are a technomancer. Of the new echoes one of them is a reprint of Mind Over Machine in the core book, one is a totally useless +2 to your mental limit when you try to do math, but there is one the effectively gives you a pain editor and one for skinlink. The rest of the echoes aren't really noteworthy. Of the 5 complex forms listed all of them are useless except Misread Marks which allows you to fool IC into thinking your marks are legitimate.   Nontechnomancers have a lot of interesting toys to play with that open a whole new can of worms. You can get commlinks that can run agents and give your commlink either attack or sleaze ratings, as well as modify your deck somewhat by installing modules. These open up a lot of new possibilities.   There are rules for AI characters, which are probably either ridiculously good or ridiculously bad, but people haven't played around enough to find out which.   Finally there is a lot of new information on how hosts work which has met mixed review. Effectively all hosts are grown out of something called the foundation that seems a lot like the Deep Resonance but isn't. The rules are pretty interesting but this is an area that is more of GM tool than it is a player option. I say that because entering the Foundation means you are going to re-enact Inception where you enter a dream world and must try to blend in with your surroundings while you attempt to find the macguffin that will allow you to alter the host as you see fit. My biggest issue is that any question of how this all works or was set up has been deliberately hidden and obfuscated for publication in another book."

So, to follow the canon, one could take the extra point in Reaction and put them into either Body or Willpower. Though one could also argue that their extra toughness comes from the environmental suit."
Shadowrun,38s3y4,SoikerNahmu,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:55:23 2015 UTC,"I think that biotics has the opportunity to be a very interesting balance for tech-based magical skills. New Biotics skill for basic manipulation of ME fields and associated new cyberware (L1 through L5 bioamps and armor mods). Treat Biotics as its own magical tradition, except using Willpower as the Magic stat (biotic focus) and resisting drain with Body only, with the caveat being that your drain is reduced by the rating of your bioamp - L5s can sling around light pulls like nothing, which gives advantage to the tech side rather than ability side.    As far as quarians go, I think that, all bonuses considered, rather than docking their essence right off the bat to get immune system booster implants, just make them the opposite of dwarves: give them a racial -2 modifier to all toxin/pathogen resistance tests.   Racial Quality: Immunocompromised Any time a Quarian's chemical seal is breached, they must pass a Body+Willpower[Physical] (3) to resist infection and allergic reaction, applying the modifiers below. On a failed roll, illness will manifest in 1d6*10 minutes, at which point the Quarian will suffer Nausea for a number of days equal to the Net Hits on the failed dice. On a glitch, illness will set in after 1d6 minutes. On a critical glitch, the illness will cause an immediate severe allergic reaction (SR5, 78) which stops only with the completion of an extended First Aid test (10, 1 minute).     Breach Scenario Modifier    Breach includes wound to physical body -3   Antibiotic autoinjector is active +1   Occurs in a clean environment (well-maintained ship, cities with no pollution) +1   Occurs in a well-cleaned, air-filtered environment (satellite clean room, surgical floor) +2   Occurs in a room cleaned to Quarian standards for suit removal +4*   Breach occurs in a vacuum +4**    * Even with maximum protection, Quarians still experience allergic and immune reactions at even the slightest exposure to foreign agents, including their own families. ** Who knows, you might have an allergic reaction to the bullet  With this fairly crippling racial drawback, and swap that point of intuition over to body as a start bonus, they're both closer to canon and a bit more justified from a mechanics standpoint. They're a fairly powerful race so long as they stay in their suits; the risk of a suit breach and the near-total risk of death that implies is a major aspect of Quarian life."
Shadowrun,38s3y4,xthorgoldx,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take those Quarian Stats from you.    I'm planning to have Biotic Ability be a Karma-Purchased Trait. That's on top of a Skill that has the Trait as a pre-requisite, which will probably use Willpower.   This is because I'm planning to have two kinds of Biotics running around. The first are your Cannon Biotics, people who have to have Amplifier Implants plugged in to overclock their nervous system and give them better control. The second class are Biotic Adepts, as in Mystic Adepts that use magic to replace their Amplifiers.  Cannon Biotics wind up tearing their essence to shreds with Cyberware. The required implants are very invasive, and can cut up your essence quite a bit. Not enough to cripple Magical Capability, but enough that you won't be top-tier. Most Biotics wind up getting more Cyberware afterwards, since they're already wired up a lot.  Biotic Adepts are still Adepts, of course. They can get any of the powers from the Mystic Adept. The big difference is that they're forgoing Cyberware to use Magic to allow them to get at their Biotics. These Adepts have a weak spot, of course: Space. No Gaiasphere, no Magic, no Biotics. So there will be some ""Biotic Adepts"" that have some low-grade implants to fall back on in the Void... but that reduces their capacity to be Adepts as a tradeoff."

Shadowrun,38tkqh,JoeOfAllTrades,3,Sat Jun 6 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"I've found 10k nuyen and 5 karma to each player a run seems to work alright.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pNZTfFJPUUxXUzd1sq58_fzC13gmjQnr8H68eTwJMlk/edit?pli=1 This is a good document to make sure your players have seen, if they are making their own characters without your oversight (and its useful for you as well)  In terms of your missions, it sounds like you have an alright few sessions planned, but the team could be doing much more. I feel like a promotion would be the start of the campaign (1-3 missions to get him promoted, thus 1-3 sessions). Ideally you'd probably space these missions out a little, have a different Johnson (maybe a different corp, maybe a mafia don) give them a mission in between some to do something much more exciting and experience more of the world (hijack a high security train before it arrives in town with its valuable cargo maybe). Then make their actions within the campaign effect what happens next to show them actions have consequences.  For example lets say both your managers worked for ares, now that manager 2 is in charge he steps up funding for this towns Knight Errant division. Suddenly your players might find this interfering with their day to day lives (as well as the shadowrunning). Having spaced out your promotions missions the players get to see how much harsher KE is being now  Alternatively they worked for Mitsuhama, manager 1 had some influence in keeping the Yakuza much more professional. Now that your team has disgraced him, they do not see the honor in following his instructions. Suddenly you have gang warfare between Yakuza and mafia footsoldiers in the streets. This is both horrifying for civilians (collateral) but opens up lots of gang vs gang options (assassinate an influential lieutenant, plant a bomb at a mafia meeting to increase tension between the two, intercept a convoy of drugs and steal them)  For a great campaign structure, check out the highest rated comment on this reddit post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/35ma0j/what_does_an_archetypical_shadowrun_campaign_look/"
Shadowrun,38tkqh,felicidefangfan,2,Sun Jun 7 00:38:19 2015 UTC,"Run rewards are on page 375 of the core book.  Alright so a big problem at my table was that the other GM (me and another guy alternate and he GM'd our first run) paid us too much. Long story short, we walked away from an extraction with 67,500 nuyen apiece (15k of that had been up-front). This meant that when it came time for me to run the next session and I offered them a still significant provisional 10k apiece (which could mostly only go down) they debated just killing the Johnson to take his stuff because it was below what they thought was their paygrade (rather than over 3 times what they ought to be getting).  Take-away from this, keep the rewards low, give them the opportunity to earn more while executing the mission (paydata and whatnot). The payout of a mission is part of how the team is supposed to gauge the difficulty they're likely to face, and throw up warning flags and whatnot (if you normally make ~3-5k a mission, and the johnson offers a milk run for 20k, that's a red flag).  Beyond that, flaky players are great in shadowrun for the reasons you mentioned. But beware that if you have runners active on a mission and it goes beyond one session, you're going to have to figure out how to handle players not showing up for the next one, or not showing up for part 1 and then showing up for part 2 wanting to play. These are not game-breaking problems, but you'll want to think ahead and/or talk with the players about these things.  I like your campaign plan btw, simple with plenty of hooks and a twist ready to go. Still gives you and the players wiggle room for things to go unexpectedly, not railroady. Consider a few breather runs from other Johnsons though, depending on how often you get together and who shows up."

The site has some other good stuff too.  http://pavao.org/shadowrun/cheatsheets/  I would encourage you to think bigger than this. Much bigger. Shadowrun is at its best when you're breaking into research labs to steal prototypes, intercepting delivery truck caravans, extracting a willing top scientist from an unwilling corp arco, tracking down wendigo and naga, getting sent into war zones to look for an MIA commander... Get the picture?  And granted, these types of things may be overwhelming for a new GM, you said you want to live up to the awesomeness of Shadowrun so go bigger than ""ruin this nice guy"", ""get betrayed by Johnson"". Though do still do the get betrayed by Johnson part... at some point."
Shadowrun,38s232,Neonkharma,8,Sat Jun 6 09:07:23 2015 UTC,"I believe the intention is that clips are per-weapon and ammo is per-category unless stated differently.

For example the AK-97 and -98 are the same weapon, just one has the UGL on it, so I'd definitely allow clip transfer."
Shadowrun,38s232,EmperorJon,3,Sat Jun 6 09:22:07 2015 UTC,"Rules-wise, spare clips are unique to each weapon. You'd have maybe 10 AK-97 spare clips and three Predator V spare clips. So you can't use a clip for the former with the latter.  I'd say you need to specify how many rounds you have, otherwise you can go ""I've bought APDS"" and never run out of them.  That said, you can reload clips. So you're not stuck with regular FMJs once you've loaded up a Predator V clip, for example. You can replace it with any other type of Heavy Pistol ammo you've got laying about."
Shadowrun,38s232,SweRacoon,3,Sat Jun 6 09:22:55 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that, largely for sanity's sake, ammunition is standardized by category rather than specific weapon, so you buy Heavy Pistol ammo that will work in a Predator V or a Ruger Super Warhawk.

You buy, say, 5 spare clips for a specific weapon types, and then a bunch of ammo to put in them (each having the same capacity as the weapon you bought them for). So technically, yes, you need to specify how many rounds of ammo of a particular type you have laying around (at least part of which will be in your spare clips).  If you want a stash, it's probably easier to buy a sufficiently high amount of ammo of each type, plus enough spare clips of those weapons you want. Then pre-load the clips, with some of each kind, and keep the leftover in the ammo box as spare."

Shadowrun,38qg8g,dezzmont,2,Sat Jun 6 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"Except your damage output is inferior to firearms even hitting the same target more than once uness they have a truly insane amount of armor, and you have a large risk of glitching, and you are taking drain on top."
Shadowrun,38qg8g,Roxfall,4,Sat Jun 6 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"Well, as explained above, in this particular example, the drain you're taking is rolling a bunch of dice, consuming precious gaming time, and getting no drain, or very little drain if you're truly unlucky. The drain in this case is just wasted time dice rolling.  Armor does nothing against stunbolts or manabolts, and looking at actions used (one complex action to cast six bolts vs one complex action to fire a full round burst), I'm pretty sure the output is similar, if not better. Don't forget, being resisted with willpower instead of body is a big deal.  How much ammo do you need for the manabolts? How concealable are they? Can they go through a metal detector? How about range? Can you nail all ten rounds into the guy with a full round burst at 1km? 2km? 10km?  Can you kill a spirit with those ten rounds?  I can keep going, but I think that's enough for now."
Shadowrun,38qg8g,dezzmont,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:26:44 2015 UTC,"I never got the logic of dice rolling as a waste of time.  Rolling dice is not a labor intensive process. Cross checking rules is.  Armor indeed does nothing vs stunbolts, but your actual damage output is still much lower using them.  An SMG loaded with APDS is easily concealed and has a damage code of DV 8, AP 4. Versus the average defense pool of 7 you can fire a full auto simple burst and soak the recoil, reducing the defense down to 2, or a -.66 DV in damage.  Your skill and stat in this hypothetical example are 6, not exactly a heavy investment for a samurai, and we will say you have implanted smartlink and took aim, giving you +3 dice to hit, a total of 15.  Your DV post attack is statistically going to be DV 12, AP 4.  Average soak dice total is 16, meaning your damage is reduced by 4, meaning you just dealt 8 damage in a burst of fire to your target.  Your 3 stunbolts, and you can only fire off 3 at once due to the rules for multiple attacks, each have an average damage of 4, and reduce damage by 1, meaning that versus a mediocre shot you are getting 1 net damage at the cost of: Shooting as a complex action, Drain, Outing yourself as a mage, Investing in mage prioirty, Two qualities, and a specialization.  A sniper rifle makes the anti-armor arguments of a manabolt look like a joke. Sniper rifles are capabe of negating armor almost entirely, versus a good rifle you need at least 18 armor to even get 1 point of armor resistance, and considering the base DV of a rifle is 13, that means your target needs to have 57 armor, hardened or unhardened, that is not mystic armor in order for the manabolt to break even compared to a rifle.  As for considerations such as ammo? Mostly irrelevant, it is very hard to run out of ammo in shadowrun's combat system, most fights last a single clip unless you fire off surpressing fire. SMGs can effortlessly be concealed in a Berwick Combo setup, metal detectors are not even really a thing in shadowrun anymore, MAD scanners are the standard and are very bad at actually detecting firearms if you read the sensor rules, and yes you can hit someone at 1 KM with a full burst with many guns, and you can't even actually get line of sight at 100 KM due to the curvature of the earth, for reference the horizon on top of Mt Everest is 300 KM and lets face it, if ou need 300 KM distance to your target you are probably the world's worst shadowrunner. Not to mention that your sightline is going to most likely be blocked long before 1 KM in the sprawl. The only thing actually going for manabolts is the fact that unless your target can see onto the astral they will not be able to spot you.  But lets toss this up compared to a mage firing indirect magic, which completely adresses concerns such as weapon concealment and metal detectors.  A mage casting a force 6 lightning bolt with a drain resistance pool of 13, not at all hard to get for elves if you are specializing in this trick, will not take any drain 90% of the time. They have the same skill rating and specializations as the other mage, and the mentor, but drop Witness in order to get a force 2 combat focus, bringing their pool up to 18.  Firing off 3 force 6 lightning bolts divides their casting pool down to 10 dice each, safely hitting their target all 3 times with 1 net hit at least, leaving a final DV of 7 AP 6.  Again, the average soak is 16, meaning that shot is being resisted by around 3.33 damage, resulting in a final total damage to the target of 13 compared to your 9, with the kicker of elemental effects such as electricity. Again, for the manabolt to be more effective your target must have an armor total of 24, hardened or unhardened, again not counting mystic armor. There is the potential of a dodge, however I would counter that your potential to glitch with 8 dice being rolled 3 times is somewhat higher and you can always just fire off a the elemental spells as AOES, reduce your damage to 10, and eat 1 stun statistically.  Then there is overcasting. A mage with 13 drain resistance dice can use reagents to ensure overcasting is not lethal damage and then fire off two force 8 lightning bolts at their target, eating 1 statistical stun. They then get to roll their full dicepool of 18, getting 2 net hits each and landing two attack with a DV of 10 AP 8, which results in a final damage total of, post soak dice, 16 damage total with an elemental rider.  This also doesn't get really into the fact that smaller dicepools are less stable and have more outlying results, your spell is more likely to completely fizzle versus an above average target with mana spells than it is with indirect becase it is easier to beat someone twice your dicepool when you are rolling 4 dice than if you are rolling 7, and of course how counterspelling completely and utterly destroys you and is a very common security tactic. Indirects also get better as your skill rating, drain resistance from centering and centering foci go up, because each force of spell is guarenteed damage that indirects don't get, allowing you to split fewer spells and get more stable. By the time you have a force 4 centering focus and 2 initiations it isn't even a contest, indirect wins by a large margin, you can toss out 3 force 9 lightning bolts or clouts for 9 damage a pop without taking stun, and down someone with 27 damage assuming average soak.  Witness my hate did a lot to help single target direct magic, but it is still not mathmatically sound to specialize in direct for the purposes of damage for the average target, or even for unusually armored targets such as vehicles and FBA targets. You go indirect to hit targets on the astral or to hit people invisibly with no visual phenomina. If you want to spike you go longarms, and if you want to spike naked you go indirect."

I don't think indirect spam is playing to the strength of the spell class though, although it does have moderate synergy in a sense because you can just use it when hitting targets optimally hit by direct such as astral forms or random joes on the street in broad daylight, but casting  manabolts rather than three and taking two complexes or simples with drain is probably more stable. In assassination situations you likely don't need too much extra speed and avoiding glitches is more important."

If it takes 3 hours to resolve 3 seconds of combat, and you live to be 100 years old, playing shadowrun your entire life, then how many seconds do you get to live?  In a more general sense, combat mechanics that can happen on someone elses turn, in practice, slow the game down. Less than on your turn, but they slow it down regardless. You might have missed an important development while doing drain math in your head and then have to ask the GM to repeat. Or worse, you glitch, knock yourself or someone else out and last two actions that were resolved faster than your meaningless drain roll hell now need to be retconned.  Drain rolls arent a victimless crime."

Shadowrun,38qg8g,dezzmont,2,Sun Jun 7 03:25:56 2015 UTC,"What the frag?  Okay, did some reading, page 281 of the core book...   Since the modifiers per spell may be different, they are applied after you split the dice pool.   I initially assumed that you would split the dice after adding specialisations and mentor bonuses, but the rules say otherwise.  However...   Now I'm assuming Spellcasting here is the 2 dice I split off from the pool. So it should be Magic 6 + Spellcasting 2 + Specialization 2 + Mentor Spirit 2 for a total of 12.   Nope.  It is in fact: Spellcasting Dice Pool 2 + Specialization 2 + Mentor Spirit 2 for a total of 6. That initial 2 dice included your Magic.  But the simple fact that according to the rules, you get +4 dice for each combat spell you cast, makes this one hell of a wiz trick. Oh and Witness my Hate is a nice trick too :)"
Shadowrun,38qg8g,PinkTrench,2,Sat Jun 6 01:25:20 2015 UTC,Oh you're right! Duh. Somehow I was thinking 6 x 2 was still 6...
Shadowrun,38qg8g,dezzmont,3,Sat Jun 6 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yep. This is legal to do, but your math is off and it really isn't as good as you think it is.   This is tested against Magic + Spellcasting [Force]. Now I'm assuming Spellcasting here is the 2 dice I split off from the pool.   You assume incorrectly. The pool you are splitting is this very test, as per step 4 some spells will list what they are opposed by in the spell and this is a case of such, so you are rolling 2 dice alone with +4 from your modifiers. That means your target is resisting 6 dice on each stunbolt, and is thus taking only 1-2 stun from each, which is hardly impressive.  If you really want to mess people up with magic you are going to want to be tossing out indirect AOEs, which don't depend on net hits to deal damage and thus can be offloaded to a spirit of man, allowing you to smack down 6 24 meter diameter spheres of DV 12 AP -12 elemental damage. That is the kinda hit that will flatten a building.  Direct combat magic is really only going to be efficient both karma and stun wise when you fire witness my hate at a single target who has some form of hardened armor that isn't mystical in nature. Otherwise indirect or APDS bursts are a more efficient way to kill.  Otherwise you are correct. Drain is resisted seperately for example and calculated seperately, but for most spells worth splitting your force is going to be very important anyway and thus drain will still knock you out. A good use of multi-casting is creating a series of barriers to each provide you 3 effective armor each at force 1, as shooting through a barrier reduces an attack's DV by 1."
Shadowrun,38qg8g,xcbsmith,2,Sat Jun 6 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"More than 1-2 stun per spell. Witness my Hate adds 2 DV on the top, so it's 3-4. Much more aapreciable."
Shadowrun,38qg8g,dezzmont,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:25:09 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you are still taking a significant karma and stun investment to do stuff that other things do better.

So it's 6 dice versus 3-5 Willpower or Body from a typical target. I just need one net hit. Then I'll deal my total hits + 2 from Witness My Hate. So typically 3-4 damage.   Also, it's not like this'll prevent me from doing both. My current build is a Shaman with Stunbolt, Powerbolt, and Fireball. That's +4 to all of those casts. Though I don't the Spirit of Man will be happy with overcasting."
Shadowrun,38qg8g,WizardWolf,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:44:00 2015 UTC,Wait... how do Fetish's play out in this case? Can they bring the drain down to 0 for each of those shots?
Shadowrun,38qg8g,WizardWolf,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:53:27 2015 UTC,"Can they bring the drain down to 0 for each of those shots?   No. Minimum drain is always 2. The fetish just lets you cast a stronger spell at a lower drain. So a spell with a drain value of F-2 is a limited spell there is rarely a reason not to cast it at force 6, as you are sitting at 2 drain even if you cast it at force 4."
Shadowrun,38qg8g,WizardWolf,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:16:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i think since drain is a minimum DV2, you'd have to apply the +2 from the quality after that, so 4 each. 24 drain in a single go? Good luck with that.  Just use a stunball."

Our mage cast four low Force Powerbolt spells to destroy the restraints and let the person we were trying to rescue free.
Shadowrun,38qg8g,VoroSR,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:57:53 2015 UTC,Short answer: yes this is legal.
Shadowrun,38qg8g,dezzmont,0,Sat Jun 6 03:42:42 2015 UTC,"Since the modifiers per spell may be different, they are applied after you split the pool.   Modifiers are situational and environemental modifiers (like the Background count). Specialisations, adept powers and Mentor's are bonus pool dice. Usually two different things, at least that's how it works in other instances of multiple actions.  See p.173 for exemple of modifiers, albeit for ranged combat   Edit:   Furthermore, according to p.164 and 196, casting multiple combat spells still need to use the multiple attack free action and follows all the same limitations."
Shadowrun,38qg8g,VoroSR,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:10:51 2015 UTC,"I really hate this type of layout in the books. p.173 has Multiple Attacks but p.196 also has Multiple Attacks and they don't even say the same things.   I think, from inferring the intent of p.196, that if Drain were the same as Recoil it'll be counted all at once for all castings. That also means that the +4 is added once--again the difference between Modifiers and Bonuses eludes me at times.   So we have a total dice pool of 16. Split that up into two Stunbolt spells cast at Force 3 and you're testing for 4 Drain total for both spells. You'd be bound to get 3 hits from 8 dice, so 5 Stun Damage per Stunbolt.   There's a good chance you can bring down any target below Professional Rating 5 and still take 0-1 in drain.  Or I can shoot the guy for absolutely no downside other than ammo cost and probably be better overall. Looks like it's back to Indirect AoEs, the poor targets."

If they can manage to keep out of the way of the cops, the gangs, the creeps and the ghouls, then maybe hit up soup kitchens if they can, maybe dumpster dive from time to time.

Shadowrun,38o0jc,marwynn,7,Fri Jun 5 13:50:38 2015 UTC,"Imagine you start in any metropolitan area and start walking in any direction. You know what's gonna happen: the buildings start getting shorter, older, more grimy. The streets start to break up, under thicker and thicker coatings of road sand. Industrial areas become more frequent till you have a broad stretch of corp-industrial land, then high value property again. Imagine that after that broad stretch it just kept going the way it was. The buildings get worse, till they're literally falling apart, but people are still living in them. The nice corp chain businesses disappear except for the most basic ones, leaving little guy businesses here and there. People both liveand do business out of crumbling houses and crumbling storefronts interchangeably. Drugs, girls, weapons, hot goods, all are sold openly on every corner. People do their personal business out in the open since the walls are too thin and full of holes to offer any privacy. Violence erupts every few hours and nobody reacts much except to get in cover for the duration, behind whatever solid barriers haven't been replaced by plywood, plasticrete and sheet tin. There's an air of desperation, of hunger, and of resignation. That's a barren. That's where they make the SINless live.    These places follow the law of the jungle, and the law of the fishes. Eat or be eaten, fight or die, and there's always a bigger fish. Seems pretty simple, but it's a lesson you an spend your whole life really learning, especially lives as short as those of the SINless.    You're a child in one of these places. You're not sheltered from life. You know what it means when someone just stops being around one day. You know just like everyone else what to duck behind when the shooting starts. You know how to tell a big fish from a little one, and how to try to avoid the former.    You also know hunger, sickness, pain. Your parents could never shield you from those even if they bothered to try. You know where it comes from, why there's no food, no medicine. You know how to take care of your own needs, because a lot of the time you had to. Sometimes the whole family if you could. You learn to steal everything that's not nailed down. How to hock it to anyone that looks like they have a cred to their name. You learned to band together with the other small beasts, for safety, for power. They taught you to be hard, to be sharp, because the strongest in any group gets the first slice, and the weakest get the crusts, or nothing. Practice for the gangs you dream of one day joining.    You learn who is weaker. The burnouts in the alleys, the bums, outcasts, anyone who is not from the barrens. The sick, and there are plenty of those to go around. Between superbugs, awakened diseases, rampant industrial pollution, and lack of health care, disease does it's own culling of the weak.    You learn to prey on the weak, and the slow, and the unaware. You learn what preys on you, and where they reside. Ghoul haunts, devil rat dens, psycho's squats, the loci of vengeful spirits.    Even then, still the barrens reach out to take from among you. Some get caught in the crossfire, some in the crosshairs, after crossing some line. Predators roam the barrens, looking for fresh organs, test subjects, pretty bodies for the joy-dens. Some try a BTL and for them what follows is worse than death.    Every time one of you falls, the rest learn from it. Those that make it out of youth have gotten more deadly, perfect for the gangs, smart and sneaky, ending up dealing in one of the barrens' shady businesses, or just tough enough to weather whatever the barrens throws at you, able to scrape by here or anywhere.

Shadowrun,38o0jc,SweRacoon,5,Fri Jun 5 17:26:09 2015 UTC,"It sucks but it isn't quite on par with being from a 3rd world country or living in a warzone. It is more like living in an extremely poor part of the country, such as along the Missisipi river, where towns are very small, no one has very many nice things, but life goes on.  Most SINless live in Barrens communities, which are relatively unstable all things considered but are less mad max than people seem to portray them as. Both Shadowrun Returns campaigns for example took place in the Barrens, and you will notice that the places seem like relatively stable neighborhoods. Likewise, starvation is rare, it is really hard to starve in the sprawl because of how cheap soy is and how easy it is to just grab junk that was thrown out. Services such as healthcare are provided by relatively smart people in the hoods willing to try to provide it, although it is by no means world class the fact they are in a modern urban center means that they are able to grab high end stuff that is hard to find in a 3rd world country.  The real issue is employment and personal safety. It is technically legal to be SINless, they are considered legal persons. However it is illegal for them to be employeed, to own property, or enter most areas of the city that have any decent security rating. While the cops will actually enter the Barrens to catch people regularly commiting crimes on SINless to the point that SINners get afraid (See: The entire plot of DMS, which was a manhunt in the Barrens), for day to day crimes such as robbery or even for murders that don't ping the maintstream radar you are mostly dependant on gangs or street samurai. SINless who get caugh up in the legal system however are often not savy of any legal rights they have, and even if they were there is nothing really forcing anyone to respect them. If a tree falls in a forrest, and no one is around to hear it, did you really just grossly violate the law to toss the guy into prison with no trial? These situations are not the majority, but they are common enough to really freak out SINless who don't have any personal influence. It is much rarer for this to happen to a SINless with influence or public awareness, such as one living a fake life downtown or one who commited a high profile crime.  These neighborhood gangs don't operate like modern street gangs pointlessly fighting over turf and access to rackets, nor do they fight for pride. They mostly protect their turf and establish legitimate protection rackets, where they will actually fight to protect people who pay them from some of the larger and more insane gangs like the Haloweeners or from people trying to just loot and cause chaos. That is why there is stability in the OUG and most brawl neighborhoods, there is effectively a police force.  Street Samurai are very often protectors of a neighborhood, in fact that is why they are called as such instead of something like Cyber-warriors: The first heavily augmented warriors to enter the shadows were neighborhood protectors who needed cash. They rarely will replace a gang, but are often more than willing to kick an abusive gang out if they have to. Good hoods like Touristville often have enough to make the place seem like a normal city where as some of the more dangerous settlements don't have any.  The problem is that these gangs are often the only real way to make a living in the sprawl for SINless, which means there is a surplus off people joining gangs and thus most gangs get a bit too big for their turf to support. Enough so that there are often skirmishes at the borders of barrens settlements but not enough so that it is a complete warzone, except in the really bad places.  SINless can also make a living by providing services to corporate workers who work at the many many factories in the Barrens, and in fact who often live in them themselves. Think the guy who sold you soup in Dragonfall, or the black market mall, stuff that doesn't require you to pay taxes or sign up for a pension.  Finally, it is actually not too hard to jump ship to corporate work, but the results are often horrific. For people without magical talent or special skills it is disturbingly easy to get a contract as unskilled 'wire worker.  Ever wonder why skillwires are so darn expensive for so little result? Because most people with skillwires installed don't own them, they rent them from the corporation that employs them so they can get some 2 ranks in industrial engineering to work a factory, working for petty wages that mostly get eaten up by housing and the rent on the 'ware that is linked up to their brain.  Education in most sprawl settlements is understandably really poor. SINless can't go to school, but luckily the matrix is a thing and comlinks are common even among the average pedestrian SINless, so most people learn how to read and essentially pick up a basic bare bones education online if they care to. Illiteracy is somewhat common but the majority can read well enough.  Most SINless own stuff and a place to live, and purchase food rather than stealing it. SINless populations are encouraged by the system. Corporations sanction black markets and ensure some of their products get on it, make sure it is easy to buy things such as flats and low end food with credsticks, and make sure there are shopping oportunities located near SINless communities that don't require you to enter areas where SINless are prohibited. Furthermore, countries are required to recognize certain rights of SINless to exist in order to participate in the SIN registry, and the SIN registry requires participant countries to make sure that the percentage of residents not granted SINs doesn't rise above a certain level. It is also possible to earn a SIN in many ways such as public or millitary service in adition to simply being employed by a corp or proving you have a valuable skill to what is essentially an internal customs office. Millitary service in particular is an extremely common way for Orks to obtain a SIN, and as a bonus the Millitary is one of the only institutions in the UCAS that actually recognizes the fact that orks age faster than humans and thus is one of the few paths of higher education that is feasable to an ork who wants to start a family.    There is a dark side to this. While most SINless live relatively normal lives, if with a poor standard of living a similar to that of a blue collar worker in a very poor part of the United States, there are some SINless who are completely and utterly destitute with no sense of normalcy. They are not the norm, they don't live long enough to be the norm, and they live in between barrens settlements or far out in areas no one else wants to live, like Glow City.  These are the guys without comlinks, who fight for scraps, who often are starving and who often will just kill for the sake of it, and who give the Barrens its mad max rep. They often live that sort of life because they for some reason cant intergrate into a settlement, or because something is wrong with them and that is the kind of life they want to live."

The township's population is incredibly young, with 40 percent of its residents under 19 years old and only about seven percent over the age of 50.   This one I think stands for itself.   As with many slums, most people in Neza-Chalco-Itza live illegally on unauthorized land. However, unlike in most areas, some of Mexico City's slum dwellers also live in vecindades, former mansions abandoned by wealthy families that have been converted into low-income rental apartments. About 10 percent of all the residents of the Mexican capital live in these buildings.   After the first VITAS outbreak took about 1/4 of the world's population, population centres swelled with migrants looking for medicine and safety.  This left a lot of room for poor people to move into - some of it formerly rich areas."

It means 'summon a spirit as a distraction/to fight a paracritter/to hide in a bottle and give us Concealment/to scout/to fight that mage's spirit when we jump him' is perfectly viable, but 'summon a spirit to punch down the front doors of the facility, murder the staff, and fight off the HTR team' is not."

Also, since the individual is literally engulfed by the spirit's form I rule that any attacks against that individual hit the spirit - and the individual cannot be targeted by direct LOS spells on the physical plane since the spirit's physical form blocks it (a lesser would be to say the individual engulfed at least has some intermediate cover from spells and ranged attacks).   Are you able to attack it while engulfed?   I say yes.   Does the sustain element cause it to have -2 on all of it's actions including the damage check against the engulfed player?

Epecially considering the mention of high pollution. Thats gonna give a -DP penalty to all healing tests. When using first aid, you are talking 1 combat turn per box healed.  Your best bet is to have the technomancer pickup the first aid skill to a good level, With a medkit. Have him do it as he will have a large logic already.   We have a shaman, a mage of some sort, and a face for sure, and a technomancer-inclined player   From the sounds of things you need some good old fashion street samurai action. Look for about 25-30 soak, a good shooting pool for a weapon of choice, and some solid other skills to round him out."
Shadowrun,38p0qr,Bamce,5,Fri Jun 5 18:22:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the class thing, I wanted to specify an archetype I guess, rather than just the dabbling, though SR seems highly dependant on that as a rule for survival.

Shadowrun,38p0qr,PinkTrench,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:29:22 2015 UTC,"So the Mage and Shaman should both learn Heal. You get one Heal spell, and one First Aid attempt in a specific order(can't remember which) and that's instant hits of healing. Past that it's slow as normal, and your best bet is Doc Wagon or a Street Doc contact."
Shadowrun,38p0qr,Forged_Fury,2,Fri Jun 5 18:53:17 2015 UTC,"Yup, first aid first, then magical healing. One reason why healing in SR sucks so bad is the First Aid rules. They seem really kluged together. First, there is a two hit threshold, so unless you get more than two hits, you don't actually heal anything. Beyond that, you can only heal as many boxes of damage as you have ranks in the First Aid skill (in addition to already having a mental limit in place). Given all of the negative modifiers to First Aid (Is the patient Awakened? Penalty. Are they instead semi-heavily augmented? Penalty. Are you in an average environment like in a house? Penalty), you're usually lucky to get enough hits to heal a single box of damage. Granted, I totally get that they didn't want people to just shake off physical wounds like it wasn't no thang, but seriously.  Oh, make sure the Technomancer gets a sprite to run diagnostics on your medkit. Free dice!"
Shadowrun,38p0qr,PinkTrench,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, a pretty well off person with Log 1 can buy 12 dice to roll."
Shadowrun,38p0qr,Forged_Fury,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"Right, but then those penalties start kicking in. Unless you're in a sterilized facility, you're looking at -1 to -4. Three of the other runners are subject to that -2 Awakened/Emerged penalty. It gets to the point where you're most likely only going to heal one box of damage. I really think the only way to have a really effective mundane healer is decker high logic, R6 Medkit, and maxed First Aid. That could be about 20 dice. Say 6-7 hits, -2 for the threshold, you could heal 4-5 boxes of damage, which is really damn good when you think about it."
Shadowrun,38p0qr,PinkTrench,2,Fri Jun 5 19:26:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can make anybody good at a thing, but those 7 points in First Aid are gonna be sorely wanted elsewhere by a role that skill intensive.  Honestly I don't think they should have split First Aid and Medicine, or at least allowed First Aid to make Medicine rolls at a -3 with Matrix access."
Shadowrun,38p0qr,Forged_Fury,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"6 points, but yeah, it's definitely a concern since most characters are skill starved. You could drop it down to 3 and still have a reasonably good success rate if you have one of those high logic deckers and an R6 medkit. That's 17 dice to throw at it before penalties. You should get five or so hits. Once the threshold requirement is added in, you'd get three net hits which would cap out against the First Aid skill of 3."

Shadowrun,38p0qr,rejakor,2,Fri Jun 5 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"Like bamce said, that group looks like it needs some muscle.  Don't think you need to be a troll - the priority cost is so high you're better off being a human most of the time.  There are two kinds of muscle in SR5.  Adepts, and street sams (now used mostly to distinguish adepts from cyberware users).  Cybering is mostly grabbing Resources A, and cutting your essence down to about 1ish with agi-9 cyberlimbs with armour on them, leet splatbook armour from run and gun, muscle replacement OR muscle toner/thing, wired reflexes OR synaptic reflexes, some kind of bone plating, etc.  You find the best combo of cheapness and essence loss to add armour to yourself, increase your agi, increase your strength to reasonable levels, increase your reaction, and you have a high BOD and WIL to help soak damage.  You max out a gun skill, take gymnastics, running, perception, sneaking, any leftover points generally go into either a single face skill so you can Etiquette your way into the background, or Intimidate mooks and generally not default in every social situation, or you pick up a second combat speciality, like a set of hidden cyber-spurs (armblades) and the associated skill.  So you're looking generally at resources A, attributes B, skills C, meta D, nonawakened.  For Adepts, you have to spend your adept points extremely wisely as you can't take 'ware.  So you generally buy a low rating of Adept (D or C usually), bump it up with metatype points, put your adept Power Points into increased reflexes, stat booster (Agility), stat booster (reaction), and take Attributes A.  Skills B is more negotiable, but the basic idea is that you have higher raw numbers than the street sam due to higher base stats, and you keep up that way.  The street sam has to blow like 150k on wireless reflexes and whatnot, so he basically has to take Resources A most of the time.  You get it for priority C, but Power Points are arse for increasing attributes, so you need attributes A to end up with a stat array similar to the Sam.  Attribute Boost is very cheap for what it does, which is break the metatype maximum by spending a simple action for a few combat rounds - basically your first IP is burned going into Matrix-Dodge mode, but then you have inhuman agility and rea and you can keep up with the street sams.

Shadowrun,38p0qr,gimlettio,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:10:03 2015 UTC,"Unless you really want to play a dedicated healer (usually overkill, relatively limited use overall so you better pick secondary roles well) you can go pretty damn far with just gear, especially if you pick a build that leaves you with extra nuYen, or even just picking up bits and bobs as you get paid over the course of missions.  Gearwise, a rating 3 medkit ""fits in a pocket"" and is 750¥ and I really recommend that it be carried by almost everybody.  If you want to go further, a rating 6 medkit is 1500¥ is the size of ""a handheld case"".  The medkits can be used without any other skills and get pretty decent dice pools on their own (Rating x 2).  If you have a high Logic attribute, at some point (preferably NOT in chargen) pick up a few points of First Aid skill, then the test is (First Aid + Logic + Medkit Rating).  As you can see, you have to have pretty good skill + Logic to beat a rating 6 medkit :p  I usually just rely on the medkit...  You can/should supplement that with some additional drugs/gear as you have the cash.     Stim slap patches will temporarily heal stun damage, 25¥ per Rating, get a few different sizes.  Your mages will love you for this if they go down due to Drain.  Really they should have some pre-placed and tell teammates where to slap, but it never hurts to have a few of your own.     A Trauma Patch will autmatically stabilize a dying patient, 500¥.     Antidote Patches are 50¥ per rating, well worth having a few, go for the top rating you can get.     You can get an autoinjector 1500¥ in the Run&Gun book, program it to apply various drugs/meds under various conditions.     A few drugs for dire emergencies, (also handy for trading with lowlifes) like Jazz, Kamikaze or Nitro (p 410 in the core book).  Cram if you get a bit of notice.     Laes/Lael to make people (ie witnesses) forget recent events - from the Stolen Souls book 750¥/400¥ per dose.  There's some other healing gear/drugs/needlessly complicated optional rules  in Bullets and Bandages.  Magic users/shamans have various spells available, Heal being the obvious (and incredibly handy) one.    They also can have Antidote, Cure Disease, Detox, Prophylaxis, Resist Toxin and Stabilize, p 289 in the main book + a few others scattered in the various supplements.   Except for heal not really worth the spell slots, alas (imo, especially at chargen) , it's better to use gear and use the spell slots to avoid or rapidly defeat enemies.  To pick up over the course of a campaign they could be flavorful and of some use, but there's SO many other useful ways to spend that karma..."

Shadowrun,38s2kk,EmperorJon,11,Sat Jun 6 10:07:51 2015 UTC,"The type of stuff where you'd just surrender   Did the players know that surrender was an option? They did just fine the day before when massacring the bar gang. After doing that, they might have assumed surrender was giving themselves over to a group of people who already wanted them dead. I wouldn't want to surrender in that case either.  Also: guard-posts, spotlights, spike traps, grenade launchers, and a jeep/motorcycle convoy, on TOP of being powerful mages? That's the most powerful and organized group of Barrens gangers I've ever heard of. The little clues and hints you've dropped seem very obvious to you, because you've created it all! Doesn't sound like they knew what they were getting into.    You might want to look into Numenera's GM Intrusion mechanic. Basically, any time the GM wants to break the rules or push the narration in a certain direction, he can bribe a player with Karma (or Edge) to go along with it. I think it would work well in Shadowrun, and I've been wanting to try it myself.  For instance, the players might lean toward an action-hero escape when the spotlights came down, but you want them to get captured and interrogated with a horrifying torture scene. But then you might have to plan for shock tasers, stunbolts, grapple checks, nets, vehicle chases, or at least hope you sufficiently intimidate the players. Lots of rules and potential for confusion and miscommunication, which I'm guessing is what happened in your game.  But you could say, ""Here's 1 Karma for each of you if you throw down your weapons and go along with your captors. Or you get zero Karma and the chance to earn more on your daring escape."" Most of the players go along, but one player says fuck that and tries to run--his character doesn't want to be locked up. ""Okay. Last chance: you try to escape, and you might succeed, but here's another complication. You get TWO Karma and a fully charged Stunbolt hits you before you get to your vehicle, or you get zero Karma and make it to your motorcycle without getting hit first. No promises for what happens after that."" If he chooses no Stunbolt, he escapes. If he survives the Stunbolt (possibly by blowing Edge), he also gets to escape. If he fails, then you've given him a chance to ""save face"" by taking damage and getting captured anyway. You've nudged the player toward the outcome you want, but you've also given him the opportunity to negotiate how the scene plays out.  (If he takes the 2 Karma instead of the original 1, you've also made the other players jealous and distrustful of accepting your low-ball ""bribes"" in the future. What a devious GM!)  If that player REALLY wants to get away, let him. Next session he can plan the rescue attempt he was hoping for. Let him play the way he wants to play. You can give the escapee player makeup Karma later if you hate the thought of players getting unequal Karma rewards. Or not. The other players will suffer consequences for getting captured, but they're rewarded enough to make that a real option. Play with the incentives enough and you'll get the game you want to play.  EDIT some more explanations"
Shadowrun,38s2kk,rejakor,-5,Sat Jun 6 10:17:16 2015 UTC,"It wasn't really about ""surrendering"". They could have just gone away and tried something different. They had a bunch of hints and options, they neither had to take the fight, nor to surrender (they got about three chances to flee, where they all decided to turn around and engage.)    About the organisation: Yeeah, that's where I thought they'd swallow as well. THIS ISN'T EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE TO THE ORGANISATION AND FIREPOWER OF A GANG.  They ALL had (small, but still) full automatic weapons, and the players already stumbled upon this, but chose to ignore it, even after I forced them to realize it ;D  I'll take a look at the link, but the example doesn't really sound like I'd like to embed it, though I probably should play around with karma/edge a little more.

'There's a subway entrance up ahead, a NEOnet skyscraper with armoured guards out front on a corner before it, second story buildings that block view either side, they'll cross into this street at one of the intersections ahead and smash you' etc.  Players cannot see the world.  They are blind.  You need to skip the step of them seeing everything and working out what they can use, and just tell them what they can use.  It seems obvious to you because you can see the whole setting, and what is going on.  It isn't obvious to people without that information.  Google the 'Three Clue Rule' for more discussion/information.  The basic thing though, is that you can't 'hint and wait' if the players are about to walk into an ambush that you have not adequately told them will kill them.  Tell them their options, because their characters would know, and not telling a player what their character knows is bad GMing."

Magicians, particularly gangers, are alpha snowflakes and you'll have a hard time getting three to cooperate let alone ten.    Secondly twenty jeeps with grenade launchers is way more  than most militaries would deploy.  That being said, never fight the enemy on their terms.  My advice to the GM is to have a rock solid reason for that kind of firepower because it can't really exist in a stable balance.  I would suggest that some corp wants that neighborhood and has put these gangers together with enough firepower that they will eventually blow each other up.  If the runners took the money and went on vacagion, the situation would resolve itself in a month.  True, there would be a lot of collateral damage, but the gangs would be dead."

Shadowrun,38nf2u,Schmokster,3,Fri Jun 5 10:05:31 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track :)  Street grimoire page 204: Banishing a free spirit   Free spirits can be banished just like any other spirit (p.301, SR5), but all of them possess the Banishing Resistance power (p. 194). Since a free spirit is usually unbound and owes no services that can be banished away, each net hit the banisher receives reduces the spirit’s unspent Edge (bound free spirits add their Edge and services together). A free spirit whose Edge is reduced to 0 in this way is temporarily disrupted and vanishes to its native metaplane. It may return when its Edge replenishes.   Banishing resistance power (Street grimore page 194)   When resisting a Banishing attempt (p. 301, SR5), treat the spirit as if it owes a number of services equal to its Edge; these refresh every sunrise and sunset and are cumulative with any services the spirit may actually owe a conjurer."
Shadowrun,38nf2u,felicidefangfan,2,Fri Jun 5 10:50:25 2015 UTC,Also disruption is what happens when damage (either physical against a manifested spirit or astral) fills up the appropriate damage track.

Shadowrun,38nf2u,felicidefangfan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:16:50 2015 UTC,"So, not that it is likely to come up, but what happens if a Free Spirit spends his last point of Edge, and then gets banished?  Spending his last point of edge shouldn't banish him (it says ""reduced to 0 in this way). Will a subsequent banishment need 1 net hit to banish the spirit? 0?  A hyperpedantic reading would mean you can't banish a spirit that has 0 edge, since you can't reduce to to 0. The most likely intent is that 1 net hit is enough."
Shadowrun,38nf2u,ElevatedUser,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:46:38 2015 UTC,"Id say 0 net hits and above would be enough to banish a no edge remaining free spirit (so as long as you tie or win the spirit is banished, if the spirit wins the opposed roll it stays)  Though its unlikely that an npc spirit will have used all its edge by the time you find it (unless you attack it and force it to use edge in combat for an easier banishment)"

A bored AI could, just for shits and giggles, hack the GridGuide system and turn the morning commute into a destruction derby while simultaneously running a DDoS attack on every Azzie computer system on- and off-planet. It goes without saying that this is not the sort of power a player should have; but to hobble an AI to PC capabilities makes it seem silly - ""Sure, we could use our friendly AI on this next run on Matrix overwatch… or we could hire a metahuman decker who can do most of what the AI can do, but can also jack into on-site servers and provide covering fire if Lone Star shows up.""  I think an NPC AI could hire a team to free itself, and I also think that an NPC AI can be as powerful or as weak as the plot required at that moment - since you don't have a player specifically invested in the AI's abilities, you never have to worry about saying ""You can't do that.""

They are perfectly playable and far more interesting than yet another 'I was corporate UNTIL I WASN'T ASK ME WHAT HAPPENED' or 'I GREW UP ON THE STREETS MAN' character.  The idea isn't, as some people seem to think (why?  why would they think this?) that the player sits there and goes 'please, oh please, rescue me'.  Instead, the player is playing against you (you're dropping hints he's an AI, and a dangerous one), he's playing against the party (who are probably getting the hint something's up) and he has access not only to his own hacking but also the corporate resources of the role he was written to fill - so that might be security spiders or maintenance drones or HTR TEAMS.  And, because you're a good GM, you wrote it all down for him in very clear and specific terminology and gave him little bits of paper with stuff on it he can just hand to you that say 'Activate Mark I prototype' and so on.  And you have set things up so that if the players know what he is/the full circumstances, they won't actually want to let him out - so he can actually lose, if he really drops the ball.  A win condition, a lose condition.  And then, and THEN, the PCs get to feel betrayed when he wins (which you'll slant things towards, because, y'know, it's far better storywise although maybe it won't happen exactly the way you expect), and then there can be a heel/face-turn as the AI player, the tricksy nasty guy, comes back with a big ol' grin and says 'Hey, well, the genie's out of the bottle now - but i'm still vulnerable - I tell you what, since you helped me out, how about I help you out?  A bit of squid pro quo, if you get me' and then they're like 'oh god', but he's great at manipulation, corporate systems, and hacking, so they really do want him on the team.  Or he shards off and one bit stays with the PCs as the greater part laughs maniacally and goes into the Resonance while promising to return as the first 'Information Dragon' or something who knows.  The point is the player 'wins', gets out, and can then join the party as that AI if they so choose.  It's great.  An excellent idea."

When the decker hooks up with the computer where the data is on, the AI (feel free to imply that the AI was Mr. Johnson all along) jumps onto the deckers deck/harddrive, but fucked something up pretty bad. Now the AI is trapped on the decker and the decker now has a new ""buddy"" that basically acts like a second personality or voice in his head."
Shadowrun,38ky3n,Mittensworth,3,Thu Jun 4 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"1) A device with wireless OFF can't run silent since it has no connection to the matrix anymore. It also makes it immune to being found by someone through Matrix Perception. 2) When you roll a Matrix Perception test, you can ask if there are any devices running silently within 100 meters. Depending on the GM, the answer is going to be ""Yes"" or they're going to tell you how many silently running devices you detected. 3) Once wireless is turned off, a hacker is pretty much unable to do anything with it. The only exception would be getting close enough to it to plug a cable into it, providing a direct connection. 4) No, other than a throwback can never have wireless turned on whereas the others can.  Hope that helps!"
Shadowrun,38ky3n,Forged_Fury,3,Thu Jun 4 22:11:30 2015 UTC,"No. Running Silent is the equivalent of not broadcasting your wifi status. Turning it off is turning it off. You can do a MP test to count the number of running silent icons within 100m. You can't locate anything wireless off through the matrix. You can hope it contains any number of RFID chips that don't switch off when the main device does, (so you can find it) or connect to it via cable. You can turn a wireless-off device back on."
Shadowrun,38ky3n,BitRunr,3,Thu Jun 4 22:13:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, chummer! Putting in what I know:   A device doesn't need to be wireless-off to run silent. If the device is wireless-off and running silent, the device would have to be plugged in directly in some way to interact with anything besides itself. Matrix Perception will detect if icons are running silent around you. It does not pinpoint and ""reveal"" all of them besides getting a rough quantity. You would still have to use Matrix Perception again (or possibly your extra hits) to further identify what it is you even found for each icon. This is where knowing a bit more about what you're looking for would be helpful (per GM's discretion) and speed up the process. If wireless is off AND running silent, only way to know it existed would be if it was directly connected to the Matrix in some way (see above answer). Let's say the device was hidden with wireless-on and you had 2 marks on it. Maybe you had an ARO on the icon so your mates could see it easily in AR, too. You're about ready to run a Trace Icon on your next turn. The device owner suddenly shuts off the wireless connection. If the wireless connection was the only way for the device to connect to the Matrix, I would say marks would be gone, the ARO may freeze in last known location, and it would be undetectable in the Matrix without directly connecting through something else. Now, the device would also lose all wireless capabilities, too. Keep in mind, if the device is directly hooked up to a PAN/WAN, if any of the other devices could be accessed wirelessly, it's still connected to the Matrix. If the decker's marks are still accessible, he/she would still know about the icon (i.e. wouldn't have to spot it again). Very little. Again, if the throwback is directly connected to a device that does have wireless/Matrix access, it is fair game to the decker. However, I think the main difference here is that the throwback literally does not have wireless capabilities. Can't be switched on/off.   Please let me know if I'm mistaken somewhere or have an alternative interpretation!"
Shadowrun,38ky3n,Bluedagger,2,Thu Jun 4 22:28:39 2015 UTC,"You've already gotten a lot of the same sort of answer, so I'll just clear up one thing that might have spurred your confusion.  AR is not like astral perception in that even when mundanes don't exist ""physically"" on the astral plane they're still ""present"" to be seen and assensed.  The matrix registers all devices connected to it visually with an icon, we know this much.  But if you run silent (as a decker) you're essentially not broadcasting your presence anymore to the matrix.  Open connections are still present though, so you can still be found if someone knows what they're looking for (i.e. matrix perception tests).  The concept is the same as a wi-fi router.  If it's broadcasting, you can pick it up easily while wardriving (driving by and looking for open wi-fi connections to exploit).  If you turn off your broadcasting on the router, people can still connect to it if they know it's there, it's just not visible.  A smart wardriver can potentially scan for traffic from that hidden router if they know one is supposed to be there and try to break in anyway.  So that's running silent.  Wireless off is literally turning off the radio.  No connection exist anymore, unless there's a cable from the device to a matrix connected device.  Any previous connections are dropped, and no further connections can be made (again unless you plug in directly).  This is the equivalent of turning off the wireless radio on your router.  No more connection, period, nobody gets to use your wi-fi, not even you.  In Shadowrun this means the device can't connect to the matrix to do all its nifty wireless things, so you lose those effects.  No bonus dice in most cases.  This is a direct equivalent to a throwback device, something that never had wireless functionality to begin with.  The only way to get a matrix connection on these devices (throwback or a wireless disabled device) is to plug in directly to a matrix enabled device (like tethering your laptop to your phone via USB to use your data plan).    Usually when a device is reconnected to the matrix it doesn't get any marks back on it aside from ownership.  There's questions though about whether a PAN with marks on it (like all your devices slaved to your commlink, which gets marked) will in turn mark all devices connected to it later (turn the wireless back on in your smartlink, and it may get marked if it's connected to your PAN again).  In the rulebook it mentions that it works up the chain (slaved PAN devices that get marked also mark the PAN's master, pg 233), but it doesn't say whether it goes back down, only that it doesn't reverse the connection on you if you fail (so failing to mark a decker's slaved pistol with a sleaze action gives the pistol a mark against you, not his deck)."
Shadowrun,38ky3n,Feynt,2,Fri Jun 5 00:36:54 2015 UTC,"but it doesn't say whether it goes back down   p233 covers it, but I don't see why you would need confirmation of what does not happen when told what does happen. It is odd how they mention marks from a slaved device on you aren't given to the master, but eh."

Shadowrun,38kcrb,Citizen4Life,2,Thu Jun 4 20:00:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. You'll need your skills to boost up your magical abilities. Not being able to buy a lot of reagents will limit your ability at alchemy so I'd focus in conjuring and spellcasting. Chosing your spells will be quite easy as you've got your character figured out. Just don't pick up all options at once; you'll need Mob Mind so let Control Thoughts go. Increase Charisma is cool but you've already got the moves. Some kind of manabolt could be nice, especially if you're not really suited for weapon combat. You may be a backup character but you never know, it's the Sixth World, chummer, you can get in trouble doing your groceries.  You'll need to use a lot of your knowledge skills to back up your music carreer AND your magical practice. That might be a drag. The other caveat is that your character will have to maintain that day job (not only gigs, but practice too); you'll need to back it up with contacts so your band will forgive you if you don't show up and your booker might be inclined to reschedule last minute. Since you won't really begin with enough cash/karma to get a sweet-ass focus, you'll need to know a good talismonger as well.  Your character being public but hanging in shady bars for the gigs, you'll need to grab a good fake SIN too, since you might to have to worry about undercover cops and private security."
Shadowrun,38kcrb,machinosaure,2,Thu Jun 4 20:54:13 2015 UTC,"I think a Rocker/Musician is great, even for a street level campaign.  Out of curiosity, would your character be vocals? Guitar?  Would you be a struggling musician?  Also why not do:  A - Magic B - Attributes C - Skills D - Resources E - Race  That way you start out with your 6 magic, two level 5 magic skills for free, and get more spells to assist your team.  The C - Skills may hurt you a bit, but you have pretty high attributes to help make up for that.  What were you thinking for skills? I think Performance, Pistols, Athletics Group, Acting, Etiquette, Negotiation, Perception, Computers would be pretty solid choices.  As for qualities, I can't think of any positive ones at the moment.  I think addiction or dependency would be good ones to have that make sense thematically.  I personally wouldn't take Day Job.  It could limit you a lot, especially if you also took dependency."
Shadowrun,38kcrb,BlueKactus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely vocals, with a good grasp of other instruments like piano/keyboard and guitar.   I thought about Magic A, but as you said it REALLY hurts my skills.  I end up 18 skill points and 8 skill group points short.  Since I'm also the Face, I have a LOT of skills of have to invest in.  I do like the 5 extra spells though.  So depending on if I can manage without all those extra skill points I might switch it around.  Resources D though... for Street Level, that's only 15k. Not worth it, compared to the extra Edge or Magic points I can get.  Still, something to think about.  The Day Job flaw might be too much, but I'll talk to the GM first and see how he would handle it.   I was also looking at the 'Inspired' quality.  It would give him that little extra allure compared to the competition and improve his rep.  And it's 'only' 4 karma (though all that adds up, and I'm 13 to start with a max of 26 with flaws)"
Shadowrun,38kcrb,rejakor,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:26:05 2015 UTC,"The 'Fame' positive quality is the one you're looking for.    Given that you want magic skills (3-5 skills, depending), face skills (3-7 skills, depending), basic shadowrunner skills (perception, sneaking, computers, a gun skill), you should probably go Skills A.  From there, you have wonderful choices.  Shamanning is WIL + CHA, facing is INT + CHA, you can get away with low STR, LOG.  Ergo you can maybe go Magic B.  Attributes B, Magic C, Metatype D (Human(and putting the extra special points mostly into Magic) makes you better at basic shadowrunning skills (more agi, more cha, more bod - your array there needs higher INT and less random BOD or whatever), but Magic B Meta C Attributes D leaves you with poor scores in a lot of atts but a decent amount of edge, which helps with binding spirits and stuff.  Depends if you want more 'magic' or more 'utility'.  Seems like utility is the winner though from descriptions.  Spellwise you want Increased Reflexes.  You can eschew Heal and Improved Invisibility - they are too ubiquitously useful for my taste, but being able to be Fasty McFast will keep you alive.  Generally you want either a sustaining focus with it in it, or focused concentration with it, but even just quick and dirty taking the -2 (-1 with Psyche) in exchange for 3d6+6 to Initiative is entirely worth it.  Control Thoughts will get people to kill you, Influence is better, Physical Mask is amazing.  Taking a suite of combat spells and putting them on the adept/samurai, especially if you're high on Psyche is.. interesting.  With Deflection (SG), Combat Sense, Improved Reaction, Increased Reflexes (a higher bonus than their native one), Improved Agi, a Street-level adept or Sam is going to become a whirlwind of death.  But what you're currently looking at is effectively, a suite of spells to enhance Facing, so you've mostly got the right ones.  Just grab increase reflexes and an air spirit (for concealment) for when the drek hits the fan and your cha will no longer save you.  Shadow (creates darkness) is bloody brilliant also, as not all your enemies will have thermal/sonar, or at least will take an action to turn it on(at which point you drop thermal smoke and activate white noise emitters)."
Shadowrun,38kcrb,rejakor,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:08:33 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that's some great advice to think about.  Thank you!  One quick question... why would Control Thoughts get people to kill me?

Mind Control scares the living drek out of people.  When someone uses mind control, they become persona non grata, even to other criminals, and the kind of resources that normally get reserved for terrorists in the south american jungles get wheeled out to deal with you.

Probably okay, no worse than Probe Thoughts.  Taking control of an exec and having them do something against their will?  Go into hiding or you're dead.

Shadowrun,38kcrb,rejakor,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:36:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting points, thanks.  In regards to the Transgender aspect of the character... I was talking to them today.  They love the idea, but I'm worried that it could spark discussions that derail the game (even if they are good discussions).  I also told them I DON'T want the character to be a bad stereotype or make fun of transgenders at all.  But I've never played with these people and only know one of them from work (barely), and I just found out they have some transgender friends.  I do as well, but since my friends already know me and know where I'm coming from (and even RP themselves) they wouldn't be offended.  But I have no idea how these people will react.  So I'm probably going to drop the transgender aspect, even though that's something I really want to explore.  This probably just isn't the right group or game for it though.  I'll probably stick with the WizRocker idea though.  So I may keep that but drop the Transgender angle."
Shadowrun,38kcrb,Bamce,2,Fri Jun 5 22:53:05 2015 UTC,"Body-morphism is a pretty cyberpunk concept.   It's also heavily enmeshed with transgender people's view of themselves (and horribly conflated and simplistically, the mainstream's view of it, in just the worst ways) and of the people who have gained fame from messing with gender, some of them have probably had GID, just channeled it in a manner that gained them something.  So it's all tangled up already, but you should probably decide which aspects of it your character actually is, and which they aren't, and when discussing it out of game use terminology that clearly indicates it, for lack of confusion if nothing else.  In-character, confusing people about 'what you are' is a pretty big part of the attraction of body-morphism/gender-bending for performance, what garners the attention, so intentionally confusing people about what is going on in-character would be probably perfectly fine.  Generally if you're doing something complicated it's best to make sure you've worked out what you're doing, and can communicate it.  Once you can communicate it, there's no further worries."

They both list Capacity (not in brackets, so capacity that can be ""spent).  Sensor arrays and single sensors list Capacity in brackets (so a ""cost"" for Capacity).  This is to show that wall-mounted and handheld housings can hold a certain capacity of sensor functions.  It also shows arrays take up 6 capacity worth from whatever they're in and single sensors take up 1 capacity worth.  The sensor description specifically notes that functions that ""have the same name as audio or visual devices"" have a capacity cost equal to their rating.  So a rating 1 camera with a rating 1 magnification has a capacity cost of 1 and can fit onto a single sensor (ex. a sensor RFID tag)."
Shadowrun,38jo57,attackfarm,2,Sat Jun 6 02:34:19 2015 UTC,"Sensor array: This sensor package includes up to eight functions listed under Sensor Functions.  What you can put your sensor in is limited by the Rating of the sensor (see Sensor Housings table).   I'd interpret the second line to mean the rating of sensor functions placed in an array.   When you use the sensor array for Perception Tests, you may use your Electronic Warfare skill in place of your Perception skill, and you may use the sensor’s Rating as your limit.   This is the given interpretation of what a sensor array's rating means.   Most vehicles and drones come factory-equipped with a sensor array (at a rating listed with their stats).   By default, sensor arrays are part of every vehicle and drone. If you want to take that to mean they have 6 less capacity than they otherwise would ... that's going to be your table's thing."

I suppose part of me questioned it, since there'd be a physical limit as to how many things you could install into that array; an array inside a minidrone should not have as much physical room compared to say, an Ares Roadmaster.  Part of me also ponders instead using the Sensor Housings table as a guide to the max amount of functions, because customizing your sensor array effectively adds no extra cash if you wanted a suite of functions to it.   After all, a majority of the current drones/vehicles house a sensor array of 2-3, sometimes more. An Ares Roadmaster's Sensor Array should feasibly carry more by the table.  Part of me thinks one should look at the housing table, since there's no pricing for actual sensor housing, but the table gives the max housing rating, so by this we could presume, by class/size, of the housing for whatever sensor array an object, be it drone, vehicle, or otherwise, has.  I just didn't want to go crazy with it, with a lack of clarification and a lack of tech-related things; I'm expecting it to be delved into further with a rigger/vehicle book."

Shadowrun,38jo57,Sebbychou,2,Thu Jun 4 23:24:42 2015 UTC,"Upon review and thoughts--  Sensor Array Rating dictates what the rating (and by extension, capacity) of a sensor function could be. A Camera rated 3 can be fitted into that Rating 3 array. No issue.  The sensor housing means what you've got space and room for, and this, in lieu of something you could actually purchase--and right now there isn't--is defined by the Max Sensor Rating in the Sensor Housing table. So a small (or smaller) drone has a sensor housing of 3, which is how many functions you could possibly put in there.  At least, that's the thought at first. If you could put up to 8 functions in everything, given the lack of cost associated with actually putting a wide suite of sensor functions, so long as you have the array built and installed.   That means that a large vehicle, plane, VTOL, etc, can and does have a wider sensor suite, and something that's minidrone can't have the same /number/ of possible functions.  Alternatively I could be talking out of my ass a bit, as sifting through this drek between what's intended and what's written are vague at best, or I might just be confusing myself reading into it.   After all, my baseline assumption with tweaking the sensor package for the van I've gotten for a character, the Cap 3 Array means that, on the camera itself, I could have a rating 3 camera, and that camera could host low light, thermographic, flare compensation (each with 1 in their cap cost). I could add another camera, positioned elsewhere. Then, saying we have a van here, we could put up to 7 possible functions, as dictated by the max sensor rating possible for a vehicle larger than a motorcycle.   At least, that's how I was thinking until I saw your reply.  Going back to cameras, it sortof.. conflicts a little since normally a camera's capacity rating is from 1-6, but seeing as sensor arrays are 2-8.. yeah.  Default sensor array packages are ass. It's probably worth it to upgrade critical/constants like the party van (Bulldog or the Roadmaster or other, based on pref) to Rating 6-7 based on the max sensor rating in sensor housing table.  Then, the 'up to 8 functions' more or less applies across the board. A sensor array/housing is more or less designed for it, after all, they talk about a can of pop able to feedback data to the company about your tastes wirelessly and what not.  Thanks for the remarks on that, it actually helps a great deal towards ironing it out as to probably how it ought to work until Rigger 5 hits."

To me, that doesn't make sense. Putting crappy low rating electronics on even a bug-sized drone, you can fit a whole mess of em. They just suck (hence low rating which means ridiculously low success limits). A large vehicule like a jet plane would simply have much more efficient versions that can actually have juice pumped into them, and they can easily fit multiple arrays, too."

Shadowrun,38jo57,CitizenJoseph,2,Sat Jun 6 05:17:17 2015 UTC,"You can get a sensor RFID tag which has a capacity of 1 and thus can only contain a single sensor.  Due to its size, the max rating of that sensor is 2.  You would have to buy the tag (40) and then the single sensor for 100 x rating (max 2).    Audio and video devices have capacity maximums as per the tables and so do cyber eyes, ears and cyberskulls.  Generally, the capacity is restricted by the type of device and cost based on the capacity you want.  However, the max rating of the sensor is 2.  A full blown camera or goggles can max out at capacity 6.  Most audio devices (except earbuds) can max out at 6 as well.  Cyber eyes and ears can get up to 16 capacity.  Cyberskulls have a capacity of 4 or 2 and thus can't hold a sensor array.  Eyes and ears can hold potentially 2 each, but the max rating of those arrays is still only 2.  This is where we can conduct the first sanity test.  For the sake of this test, we'll assume that cybereyes count as headware and we've got a sufficiently good set so that we have the capacity to install a sensor array.  You could get 6 single sensors at rating 2 each (max) for 200¥ each or 1200¥ total and 6 capacity used.  Optionally, you could get 1 sensor array at rating 2 (max) for ¥2000 and 6 capacity used.  If we assume the rules mean ""Up to eight, but you don't have to fill all the slots."" then you're paying ¥250 per sensor function but getting 8 functions into the 6 capacity slots.  I.e. you're paying 25% more but getting 33% more functionality.  However, if we assume ""Up to eight functions limited by the rating of the array.""  then you're paying ¥1000 per function and using 3 times the capacity.    The latter doesn't pass the sanity test so I believe the former interpretation is correct.  Up to 8 functions, rating limited by size,"

The language kind of bothers me. I could easily interpret it as 'you can have up to 8 functions' and done. The things that can take enhancements, like the camera, might only have a capacity equal to its rating, which is equal to the sensor array's rating."

Cars likely drop the radar in favor of an omnidirectional microphone so that you can talk to the autopilot.  Some cars may not care what is behind them and replace some of the rearward facing stuff with image link, low light and flare comp."
Shadowrun,38jo57,Forged_Fury,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:28:57 2015 UTC,"Sensors unfortunately have numerous listings that imply rules that are never directly stated.  I'll clarify the implications below:  1)  A sensor array has a capacity cost of 6, but hold up to 8 functions.  It does not only have as many functions as its rating, as that would make sensor arrays of ratings 2-6 far worse than a group of 2-6 single sensors in both nuyen cost and capacity cost.  The only way it makes sense for sensor arrays of rating 2-6 to exist is if the extra cost (10 times the cost of a single sensor) covers the benefit of housing 8 functions with only 6 capacity cost.  That provides arrays a benefit of more sensors for a cost of more nuyen.  2) However, the description of ""functions with the same name as audio or visual devices"" having a capacity equal to the rating implies that they can, if above rating 1, take up more than 1 of those 8 slots.  This is not stated, but the above sentence in the sensor section otherwise would have no meaning if this were not the case.  3) I cannot find any explicit indication of the sensor capacity of drones other than ""most vehicles and drones ship with a sensor array"".  It's been a long while since I've read the book cover to cover, but my assumption has always been that a vehicle or drone has an array as default.  What this means specifically (what drones aren't ""most"" and don't have sensor arrays?) is unclear.  The size chart clearly shows the rating of sensors are limited by the size of the drone (or vehicle) but says nothing about capacity.  They cannot, however, be the same for the same reason in 1)."

This is not stated, but the above sentence in the sensor section otherwise would have no meaning if this were not the case.   For this one, it is saying that if you have a camera as part of an R4 sensor array, that camera has 4 capacity for vision mods like low-light, flare compensation, etc. Same basic principle if you put an omni-directional mic in it, 4 capacity for things like select-sound filter, audio enhancement, etc."
Shadowrun,38jo57,attackfarm,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:45:28 2015 UTC,"You know what?  I think you're right.  I think the text is really clunky and actually intends to say it has a rating equal to its capacity, because I looked at the a/v devices, and they have capacity but no rating, while sensor mechanics require rating.  So I think it says one thing, but intends to say the other, which is what you suggested.  Nice job.  I'll have to take note of that from now on."

When capacity is listed without brackets, it is telling you how much capacity that item has. When it is listed with brackets, it is telling you how much capacity it takes up.   What isn't clear is whether the capacities cross over between cyberware, armor, sensors, etc. If they did, you could stuff a whole sensor array into a helmet. It's also a little confusing in that all drones seem to have R3 sensor arrays built into them, even though a micro-drone probably shouldn't have anymore capacity than a handheld device (which would make it unable to mount any kind of array).  Personally, I go with sensor arrays only being able to be installed into things like erectable arrays, wall mounted units, vehicles, and drones, with the Max Rating table determining how high the rating can go. Anything smaller can only handle individual sensors."

It would be a bit nicer to see it actually be a lot more clear; given it does to say 'up to ', that's not necessarily a guarantee of it. After all, do you really think that microdrone can carry 8 cameras? (Technically an array could have two cameras, facing fore and back, as even what I'm reading indicates that the housing for a sensor array is in one place, so what about rear-facing/placed cameras?)

As for carrying 8 cameras, my phone has two visual sensors, 1 audio sensor, 1 light sensor, a kinetic sensor at least, and it's just 2015.  RFID tags can be microscopic, and they can hold a single rating 2 sensor.  The rules are very vague, but size isn't itself a restriction.  Cybereyes, for example, can have anywhere from 4 to 16 capacity for various functions, depending on cost.  But the size of the eyes must remain the same no matter the capacity.  With enough nuyen, the Sixth World offers very small tech."

By your interpretation, a sensor array of rating 2 would allow 2 rating 2 functions for 2000 nuyen and 6 capacity, while having two single rating 2 sensors would cost 400 nuyen and 2 capacity.  There would never be any reason to have a sensor array less than rating 7 if this were true (rating 6 would be 6000 nuyen capacity 6 versus 6 singles at 3600 nuyen and 6 capacity).  The array exists as a way for larger sensor housings to fit more functions in less capacity at greater cost (8 functions using 6 capacity at 1000xRating for an array instead of 6 functions using 6 capacity at 600xRating for 6 single sensors).

A stealth check at a -6 dice penalty (to not crunch broken glass/ make loud noises with the filing cabinet. Net hits from the previous test would act as extra dice to reduce this penalty. If you fail this, he gets a reaction roll, otherwise he doesn't and just rolls damage soak if he hits. edit: to oppose his perception check. An edge test to see if you are lucky and it hits him (roll your players edge stat and see if they get at least 1 hit. on a glitch you completely miss and alert the guard, on a critical glitch you go out the window with the cabinet as well.)   edit2: Essentially this isn't in the rulebooks persay but could easily be approximated by handwavium gming.  edit3: One final thought, a good way of understanding Shadowrun is that there are always more rules. The combat section of the core book has 61 pages of rules, but can be boiled down to four basic rolls: Initiative, Attack, Defense, Soak. Don't get lost in the excruciating detail of these books until you need to. It will save you a bunch of time in the long run.  edit4: just noticed you were talking about 4e.

Try reading the fiction in the core rule book to see what Shadowrunning is like. Do any of your friends have the beginner box set? It has some awesome fiction as well, with the fiction having the mechanics explained.   For character creation, the 5 main pieces are   metatype (human, elf, troll, etc.) attributes (strength, willpower, etc.) skills (pistols, sneaking, spellcasting, etc.) magic/resonance (is your character magically active or a technomancer—one who approaches the matrix almost magically) resources (starting money)   You pick what's most important from those 5 pieces. So, if you pick starting resources as your first (Priority A), you get a shit ton of money.  Since your character concept is a street urchin Resources should be D or E. You would probably want Attributes or Metatype as A. One thing to note—picking Metatype as A and having your character a Human can be a good thing. You get more Special Points (I can't remember what those are actually called) which can be used for Edge, which is used to give you extra rolls to save your ass.  Knowledge skills aren't listed because they should be made up to suit your character's personality and interests. During play your GM will let you know when and how they are useful."

However, sometimes an AI would be able to make corolations from the questions and then extrapolate to guess incoming questions.  When the proto-AI reached that level, it was harvested for use in ships.  These AIs have an insatiable need for data and question.  It is an inherent part of their core programming. This isn't a problem around spaceport since there is so much demand that they are constantly in use, but once a ship gets into its interplanetary orbit, there are months to years of painful data starvation.  The AIs learned about the squeeky wheel though.  They got attention when errors showed up or breakdowns occurred. Some went suicidal in an effort to get attention, but others found simple personality quirks did the trick.  Thus, spaceship AIs adopted all the aspects of a petulant child in order to fight the boredom of deep space."

I try to see Shadowrun clearly as a ""Alternate History""/""Future of the Past"" kind of setting. I've played and GM'd Shadowrun set in 2061 for a long time now, and for me, it's always ""the future of the 90s"", where Smartphones, 3D-Printers etc. never existed the way they do today because the Crash basically destroyed Silicon Valley as it is now. A thing that does annoy me though is everything that can't be explained that way - like the nonsense of weapon technology in SR. Ammo, Weapon mechanics/Physics etc. should clearly be as they are in real life - but often aren't due to - I guess - lack of research on the writers. This video also plays into that a little - weapon parts and their individual availability, etc. Sometimes I wish I was a bigger gun nut, I would actually try to make a rule conversion for SR with more realistic firearms..."

I'm not expert in guns, but just a bit of research into the workings of guns have left me a bit frustrated with how things are organized in the game. There's probably too much to list here like this, and I don't want to go on a rant but few examples are: How Suppressors work, ""Flechette"" Ammo, ""Explosive"" and ""EX-Explosive"" Ammo, Caseless Ammo, Gas Vent Systems, the Sakura Fubuki... On a larger Scale, a weird logic behind damage codes (heavy pistols / light pistols? Is it supposed to indicate a difference in Calibre?), a strange lack of different weapon optics, and a disregard for lots of weapons being rather modular...  Now, don't get me wrong, I love Shadowrun as it is, but I just feel that's one of the things that really take me out of the game."
Shadowrun,38dvw0,drohne,3,Wed Jun 3 21:17:05 2015 UTC,"Gun Nut here. I can tell you that a lot of what you're saying males sense. Weapons are far more modular than what the RAW allows for. The AR-15 in the article has two major assemblies, and those further break down to at least ten components. Changing any one of these will effect the way the rifle functions (some parts more than others). And that's not counting sights. For which there are countless options."
Shadowrun,38dvw0,SalsaShark037,2,Thu Jun 4 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"Well, at least suppressors don't completely negate sound like they do in movies, they just impose a modest perception penalty, which is part of what they're there for (reducing noise).  But I think imposing a ""they reduce range values by 10-20% depending on the round fired, and don't work with X ammo types"" restriction is kind of awkward.  Heroes Unlimited, Ninjas and Super Spies, and their weapon compendium did that.  Let me tell you, it made things simultaneously cool that they did it, and annoying when it came time to recording stats.  Gas vents on the other hand should technically not work with suppressors, because the purpose of a suppressor is to muffle the sound of the escaping gas through a complex baffling system (or sometimes not so complex, and not really reusable pillow like system that wears out after a certain number of shots).  Gas vents do the opposite, using the gases to push out to the sides, against the direction of the recoil to keep the gun barrel stable.  For different ammo types, yes, there actually are those various types.  In today's age they don't make them for all calibres of weapon, a pistol is unlikely to have flechette or high explosive rounds, but there are caseless rounds for pistols in addition to other weapons.  In a ""far flung"" future of the 2070s (or even the 2050s where Shadowrun starts off) I'd imagine they'd have figured out how to make things explode better and propel those payloads in smaller, but deadlier packages, so explosive and ex-explosive rounds in holdouts I ignore.  Flechette is just another word for buckshot as well, though they go to great lengths to let us know that it's ""shards of metal"", which can also be darts packed into a bullet.  As for the Sakura Fubuki, that an entirely plausible weapon in a future where miniaturization could bring a vehicle mounted Gauss cannon down to handheld sizes.  I mean we already have them in mortar sizes.  The problem is at the moment we can't really think of a proper way to launch a projectile the size of your finger tip at speeds that can penetrate armour.  I assume in a future where they have a sliver gun, they've figured out that part.  Damage codes, like why is a derringer not as lethal as a .38 special, and a berretta not as lethal as a desert eagle, well those are literally definition weapons of holdout, lights, and heavy pistols.  It makes sense that a small calibre pistol doesn't have the same penetration and stopping power as a desert eagle, the bullets are far smaller and slower in a derringer.  Hell the earliest derringers fired rounds slow enough to track through the air, but they'd still kill you dead if you were a good shot.  Armour wasn't really a thing back then.  In Shadowrun though it's built into swanky suits, everyone in a dangerous job can have it.  Mr. Johnson, dressed to the nines, might be better armoured than your ""casual dress"" street sammy in his armoured jacket at the meet up.  Slower bullets also mean less accuracy at range, because not only do you have to lead more, but they lose their effective power over that distance.  A derringer probably wouldn't be all that lethal (though probably quite painful still) at 50m."
Shadowrun,38dvw0,Feynt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:08:43 2015 UTC,"Well, this is an unexpectedly huge reply. I agree in a lot of places with you, it's just that the places where it's off annoy me personally a little. I know that there's no easy solution, and I'm not saying there is.  I realized that just making a list of bullet points (no pun intended) was probably a stupid idea, and I was afraid that this might spark a huge discussion, but at the same time I guess even a longer description of what really just my pet peeves with the system would have probably caused the same problem.  A few things:  I agree on suppressors, but I feel that, considering how much they get used in Shadowrun, it's a bit weak that there's no drawback to using one and they come in one size only (apart from integral) and with a special version only for automatic weapons. Gas Vents are incompatible with suppressors since at least Arsenal 4, which is good. But, do they mean Compensators? If so, why not call them that? Pushing the gas out to the top to push the gun down against the recoil is not that complicated of a concept, and it exists. I am aware of flechette ammo, but from what I researched in the past it's actually fairly good at penetrating armor, not bad, like the system puts it. Also, just saying it's shooting packed nails is really closer to the reality of it, but I guess ""Shards of Metal"" sounded cooler. Explosive and ""Ex-Explosive"" are per description in the book not really explosive ammo as much as it's the equivalent of Hollow Point Ammo. The Saruka Fubuki is described as a Muzzle-Loaded Four-barrelled Light Pistol with Four barrels above each other. It also always comes with a folding stock and the barrels hold 10 rounds each. Putting a Metal Storm weapon into the game is a neat idea, but I think this weapons design is a huge inside joke from the german arsenal translation team, really. Yes, that is how I have also interpreted Damage Codes, but it's still strange - why do SMGs have the same Damage Code as most Heavy Pistols? The Streetline Special Holdout has the Same Damage Code as Light Pistols? I feel it's a bit odd, even if just from a game design point of few. All the Assault Rifles fire have the same Damage Code, for example. I know you can probably come up for a reason for any of these things, but I personally feel like it's not the best implementation in a system where people shoot things a lot with guns that are basically one letter away from being named after real guns.  But as I said, it's a personal thing. I'm not trying to diss the system as it is, I'm just personally not satisfied with the way it works."
Shadowrun,38dvw0,drohne,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"Well, a lot of firearms do use the same ammo types.  And again, the Five-Seven and the P90 use the same ammo, but one's a pistol and one's an SMG.  The MP5 also uses 9mm rounds you'd find in a glock 19.  As for a streetline special doing the same damage as light pistols, the streetline special is still a clip fed pistol, but it's barely any bigger, meaning it has crap for accuracy because the rifling of the barrel has less time to affect the bullet.  The issue isn't that a 9mm round does less damage in a smaller gun, it's that it becomes increasingly less accurate the shorter the barrel (up to a point, where the gas expansion doesn't help anymore and the barrel starts slowing the projectile down).  You begin to see scenarios where the bullet will deviate from going straight down range and start flipping end over end, slowing it down faster and making the bullet's effective range shorter.    And that's really the trade off that happens in Shadowrun.  You have a very concealable gun that shoots at shorter ranges than a heavy pistol which uses larger rounds and has a longer barrel.  Light pistols and holdouts on the other hand use comparable ammo and shoot comparable ranges, but light pistols have the benefit of larger clip sizes, (in some cases) including burst fire, and a much better accuracy to their benefits at the cost of not being as concealable."
Shadowrun,38dvw0,Feynt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:52:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, being a gun nut, I don't really think it would be a worthwhile investment to retool the whole system. Just applying the proper logic might in and of itself be enough."

Hell I know one asshole who ruined two before he paid someone else to mill out a third for him.  What I'm saying is that converting all of this technology into a hard-coded rule set for Shadowrun is really not that worthwhile. Unless your players are just as interested in firearms and how they work, the information will most likely bore them. What can be more interesting is introducing this technology into a story. Personally, I would probably incorporate a Psychopass story line/villain, and use technology like the Liberator (the pistol referenced in the video, which is in itself a reference to another .45 single shot pistol that the U.S. air dropped in WW2 to French Resistance fighters so they could attack German guards and steal their guns) to achieve the group's end goals."

Shadowrun,38ej61,korgash,3,Wed Jun 3 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"Not just Germany, almost every nation. Segregation was still going on in the US, the Brits weren't too nice to their minorities at that time, China and Japan had their own racial issues, and all of Europe (Soviets included) were at least wary of the Jews."
Shadowrun,38ej61,solon_isonomia,2,Wed Jun 3 19:34:41 2015 UTC,Speaking of soviets. If the magic came into the world several years before the WWII then they can treat all the magic and metahumans really bad. For example they would be blamed for the famine of 32-33 and as a result that huge wave of soviet terror in 37 can be a terror agains magic and metahumanity.

Shadowrun,38ej61,Klugen,2,Wed Jun 3 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"The entire balance would be thrown off. Jews would be able to create golems as well as have some understanding to cast spells. This would almost end up creating even more fear and paranoia around Judaism.  In fact, the sudden emergence of magic would cause a lot of oppressed minorities to be able to take control with brute magical force.  The only counter to that mundanes would have would be chemical warfare, which isn't exactly discriminant.  There would probably be a bigger rush to develop nuclear weaponry. But since that stuff doesn't like to behave itself post awakening we'd probably see a large number of nuclear accidents.  What would happen in America? We had Japanese internment camps, so we'd have basically have a bunch of shinto shamans and adepts all in one place ready to take back their freedom. Would the AmerIndians join the US Government to help stop the threat of Japanese terrorist or would they fight the government to take back their land? America would almost never be able to join the war because they'll have too much to deal with at home.  Japan just goes on to conquer all of Asia, while having to deal with gorilla warfare from the local mainlanders.  The setting would be very different while actually kind of the same..."

Lots of opportunities there for them to carve up their own empires through war, or be wildcards.   I'd actually have one side be winning and the runs be behind enemy lines. Some German 'runners get sent to the US to sabotage a factory. The Face could seduce a female factory worker--they had taken up jobs left vacant by men after all. Blow up factories/steal plans/abduct scientists.  Frontline stuff should be fun too. Also Tanks!"
Shadowrun,38ej61,marwynn,3,Wed Jun 3 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"Alright, why not go much further?   Shadowrun has some very important themes that can easily be transported in a WWII setting: Megacorporations and privatization of the states monopoly on violence.   Lets start rewriting history at the end of 1917, the great war has ravaged western europe. Russias political crisis has left the army in disarray, germanys troops are advancing without opposition through the ukraine. Nothing new on the western front, but german has been preparing a major offensive for the coming spring. Now, the awakening happens. It is a slow progress, but magic has been seeping into the world. What was already a brutal war turns into a nightmare, when soldiers awaken and are turned into arcane warmachines. The high casualty rates on both sides skyrocket when magic is introduced to the battlefield. To finance the increasingly costly war, the various warnations start granting extensive souvereignity rights to corporations and private investors all around the world in exchange for cheap loans. (Allright, my degree in macroeconomics tells me this is complete nonsense but it kinda works for a shadowrun world, instead corporations and investors could have gotten more political influence by turning their economic power into political power)   The war ends the same, but with a much higher casualty and debt rate. After the war, everything happens in a similar fashion to our world, but more and more magic is awakening in the world. Dragons emerge, elves and dwarfs start appearing, new creatures start roaming the lands. The catastrophic state in which the long and gruesome war has left the nations military and states finances, forces the nations to explore other security solutions, cheaper than only a national army. Private military and security corporations emerge, supported by the powerful corporations that want to protect their own interest in the world aswell as their newly won autonomy rights and political power.  Aside from that, the world developes in a similar way as ours, resulting in the second world war shortly after goblinization starts happening. Highly capable private squads have become a common sight on the battlefield, supporting the various national armies. Megacorporations have emerged around the world, trying to protect their own interests. But nationalism, patriotism and militarism are as prominent or even more so as in our world during WW2, so megacorporations stay loyal to their countries and most mercenaries do the same.   Now this scenary offers a lot of potential for tension and great opportunities. Megacorporations might try to influence the political side of things in their country or try to increase their chances for a big important contract, nations need highly trained individuals for special missions, or you can be part of the national army that without a doubt will have some tension with the privatized sector, trying to create effective specialised squads for espionage and other shady buisness."
Shadowrun,38ej61,iForkyou,2,Wed Jun 3 20:41:24 2015 UTC,"I've nothing to add to this, just wanted to say...I want to fucking play in this game! I'd be more interested in creating the societal/economic/technological differences than working on game plot, to be honest. I love this concept!"

Shadowrun,38ej61,the_grey_fawkes,3,Thu Jun 4 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"Hmmm...let me think.   So if magic has been re-introduced early, then so should the discovery of how to alchemically make the magical alloy orichalcum. Since ""natural"" orichalcum didn't appear until Halley's Comet passed in 2061, the closest pasing would have been in 1910 - so you could still have some natural veins being discovered if you chose. I can see this discovery being used by either Allies or Axis to invade a particular region of the world under the pretenses of war-related matters instead. Also, I see research for the uses of orichalcum being almost as valuable as the stuff itself, so kidnappings/blackmail of researchers (or their families as leverage) would be happening as well. Speaking of research, if the war is still going on for a decade or two, then so is the amount of money being spent on R&D for better tech. I think there would be a lot of spy games centered around recovering any of the atomic weaponry knowledge that existed at the time.  A thought: If women at this time were taken to building the machines of war while most of the men were sent overseas, it stands to reason that there would be a major shift in how the population is maintained, and I see the women's lib movement accellerating much faster. I think this would translate into high-level business positions and powerful governmental stations having a larger ratio of women in them than what actually happened. To keep moral going for so long, there might be a shift in how vigorous each countries propaganda machines would be working. I would expect to see/hear more ""yellow journalism"" on radio broadcasts greatly inflating the need to remain patriotic, and getting more and more hyperbolous over the years. Will the citizens of any given country start getting wary? Will separatists arise out of the anger (or feeling) of being lied to? How effective will these rebels be in convincing their fellow countrymen that their own government is pushing them too hard and for reasons that they don't support?  I can see the invention of drones in this time period not out of the question - but in this case, it would be tanks/planes that did not require humans to actually be inside to operate. The rigs used to control them doesn't necessarily have to be cyberware, but could entail the use of so many screens and metric tons of wiring the size of a small house to operate just one. This would make them prohibitively expensive, but still a great asset to use. Lets not forget the civil unrest that's going to occur with goblinization happening early. Will it be worse than how it's written for the standard Shadowrun cannon? Or will it be easier for all races to find tolerance when they're sharing a foxhole or trench with someone fighting for the exact same cause? The power of comraderie in the midst of battle isn't to be underestimated. I like the idea of rumors (true or not) of super deadly Troll SS squads. The kind of stuff that parents would tell their kids to keep them from getting out of bed at night.    That's all I can come up with off the top of my head. I'm sure if I ignore my work sitting in front of me for a few more hours, I could come up with a whole lot more."

Edit: Otherwise, you may want to check out Paranoia. Not even remotely like Dick, but I felt I should mention it anyway as it's the only RPG I've seen that, by RAW, allows the GM to execute a player character for metagaming.

We just threw out magic, and it works mostly okay from what I can tell.   It has some interesting effects, like playing a face gets a small nerf from your charisma only affecting social (no summons/magic), but most of the other stats we work into piloting rolls. Also at this point everyone in the party save myself has invested so heavily into physical adept skills that they can evade almost anything except explosives.  You've got to take this all with a grain of salt though, I've never GM'd a Shadowrun game, and the GM I play under is an old-hat who designs games in his spare time. But from an ignorant player's perspective it runs great, we certainly have enough trouble keeping the rules for Meatspace/Matrix straight without throwing magic on top of that."

The rules don't really state what you can do with commands, but Pilot programs have at least some near-AI like functionality.  Giving a command, ahead of time, like ""Shoot at the indicated enemy when I send you the message of ""Engage <direction> <description>"" is possible.

Shadowrun,38buzb,digitalpacman,2,Thu Jun 4 14:54:52 2015 UTC,"You only really run into the two issues you probably already realize. Limits are low because of no control rig. So drones are easier to spot, they die easier, and hit things less. The other problem is you can only give one command to a drone at a time. The more generic you get the more likely the pilot program will fail.  So things like ""shoot any human with a gun that isn't one of us 4"" could easily be broken to an actual human, so no troll etc. If you say humanoid, it might mess up and shoot the wrong person or whatever.  If the drones are hanging around, they won't just randomly attack without an order. So ""follow me"", with 5 drones, when combat starts, that's 5 simple actions just to get them moving."

Shadowrun,38buzb,digitalpacman,2,Wed Jun 3 06:43:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can switch them out. A Fly-spy might use Stealth and Piloting autosofts to move into position, then switch Piloting to Perception (they're called differently, by the way) for observation.

Shadowrun,38b6m0,rejakor,6,Wed Jun 3 04:11:34 2015 UTC,"I prefer SR5 over SR4, but I see its flaws. The rules are somewhat fuzzy in some places, and the writers are sometimes somewhat fuzzy about how things work (i.e. Matrix rules, even if it got better with Data Trails).  Interesting thing: You can play SR5-ish with SR4, just by using an optional rule and a few house rules.   Make the max. skill rating 12 (or 13 with the Talented quality). All other rules stay in place. Adjust NPCs accordingly, if applicable. Use the first rules from the Grittier Gameplay section in the Tweaking the Rules box on p. 75 of the SR4 20th anniversary core rulebook:  The total hits scored on any test are limited to no more than the character’s skill rating x 2. This increases the relevance of skills over attributes, but it also means that low-skilled characters will have a more challenging time. Defaulting tests would be limited to 1 hit. Edge, however, would allow you to bypass these limits. BAMM! Limits! Matrix. Just add Attack and Sleaze to the matrix attributes and you are fine to go. Commlinks don't have these and can't be used for some Hacking actions for that reason. Instead you have to buy a cyberdeck version which costs x100 the price of the commlink (i.e. the Renraku Sensei commlink costs 1.000 Nuyen while the Renraku Sensei cyberdeck costs 100.000 Nuyen). Maybe switch the names around a little bit.  Every cyberdeck has a Attack and Sleaze rating equal to its Response rating. They both can be upgraded by normal rules (SR4A crb, p.222), the costs are double the costs for upgrading response. System, Attack and Sleaze work as limits for matrix actions. You are using a standard matrix programm? System is the limit. Spoof or Exploit? Sleaze. Attack programms? Well... Attack as limit? You can run your deck in certain modes - System mode, Attack mode, Sleaze mode and Firewall mode to be precise. If you choose one of this modes, the corresponding matrix attribute gains a +2 bonus, while the other three gain a -1 malus. You can switch modes as a Free Action, but only in your own action phase.   There you go. SR5-ish SR4. Have fun."

An addiction test must be taken every 11-addiction rating week until the rating drops to 0 (i'll explain below) after you take the drug, so for Kamikaze that means taking a test every 2 weeks, whereas zen you take the test every 8 weeks. [this is my interpretation of the rules, if anyone else knows better please correct me :)]     Carl has had a tough week so he takes some zen, the addition rating is 3, so 11-3 weeks (8 weeks) after use he must take an addiction test (logic+willpower). The threshold starts at 1 for zen. So on week 1 (no test) the threshold is 1. It gets to week 2, if carl does not take any more zen then the threshold drops to 0, this means he will not need to take an addiction test at all. If carl's work stress continues and he takes another hit this week, then the threshold remains at 1. This continues until either the threshold reaches 0 (a whole week without taking anything) or he reaches his 8th week in a row of taking zen, and must pass a logic+willpower(1) test Greta is a student, she has an upcoming exam and figures some Psyche will help her study. Psyche has an addiction rating of 6, so 11-6 weeks after use she must take an addiction test (5 weeks). The threshold starts at 2 for the first week. For the second week she has more exams, so she takes another dose (or perhaps multiple doses for multiple exams), the threshold remains at 2. On her third week she has one last exam so she takes 1 more dose, the threshold remains at 2. On the 4th week she doesn't take anymore, exams are over, the threshold reduces to 1. On the 5th week she still doesn't need any, so the threshold reduces to 0 and she doesn't take a test. Ezekial is a troll guarding his gangs main meet. He tends to work nights as that's when most street gangs attack. Most nights are uneventful but every now and again him and his partner spot a group of gangers trespassing and have to move in to chase them off. Only these aren't gangers, its a dreaded shadowrunner group! He quickly uses a popper to take nitro so he can bust some skulls better. The addiction rating is 9 so after 11-9 weeks (2 weeks) he must take an addiction test, on the first week this is a threshold of 3. Fortunately for him he survives the night and makes it to the end of the second week without taking more nitro so the threshold is reduced to 2. At the end of the week he must take the appropriate addiction test (in this case both types as nitro is addiction in both ways) logic+willpower(2) and body+willpower(2). If he passes both and takes no more nitro on week 3 and 4 then he's golden. Unfortunately for ez, there's a gang attack on the 4th week and he has to pop more nitro, this boosts his threshold back up to the full 3. As such he must pass both addiction tests again, but this time at a threshold of 3. On week 5 he takes more nitro (threshold stays at 3 again) and but on week 6 he takes no more doses, reducing his threshold down to 2. At the end of week 6 he must pass both addiction test at a threshold of 2. This cycle continues until the threshold hits 0 before the 11th week."

Shadowrun,38aexi,kaosjester,3,Wed Jun 3 04:27:38 2015 UTC,"How often you take the test is 11-addiction rating weeks.  I call this the addiction test interval.  If you skip a week, the threshold is reduced by 1.  Using resets the threshold to max.  If the threshold hits [0] from not using, the entire thing starts over next time you use.  If your threshold has not hit 0 by the time your addiction test interval has come up, you have to take an addiction test.  So for drugs like Kamikaze that have a test interval of 2 weeks, but a threshold of [3], if you use even one time, you will have to take a test, because your threshold doesn't have enough time to count down to [0]  Hope that helps, the addiction rules are super confusing."

So the owner tracking the device is an artifact of devious interpretations of the rules, not explicit intent.  To that end, while the device needs to be connected to the matrix, the rules do not say that you have to be in physical possession of the device.  Since there is no explanation for why a hardware test needs a matrix connection, other than ownership being tied to the grids, there is no need for physical contact with the device under the same logic.  You could therefore detect a device connected to the matrix and then perform the hardware test from your mother's basement.  For the most part, this has something to do with the grid registration.  I would hazard a guess that during all of the tests, your cloning the simchip.  From a thematic and theatrical stand point, that chip still needs to be installed in the device, but that's more a palming under the table sort of thing.  Stealing and then changing ownership is a bad idea. Changing ownership as part of legwork is thematically appropriate and controllable by the GM.

If the players have taken a dozen assault rifles from a corp delivery then a trace location check will be made as soon as the robbery is reported (giving the players a time window to delay that report)  If the players take a crate of (already stolen) ammo from a street gang then I'd expect a very much delayed trace location check, assuming they can even make one (when originally stolen its likely the gang transferred the ammo to a new bug free crate)  Id rule that a tag eraser would likely wipe most RFID tags that could be used to trace, reducing the speed at which the team can be found or preventing it entirely (though more important loot like prototypes or corp owned heavy weapons will probably have hardened/protected RFID chips that can't be erased so easily and thus can still be used to trace the item - this is why you need a hardware check to remove ownership)"

Shadowrun,389zgi,SweRacoon,6,Wed Jun 3 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"So, there are some issues with corporate control.  1) Corporations can freely socialize costs. They go mine some coal, fill the rivers with toxic sludge, and then the coal runs out and they just go mine more coal somewhere else, leaving the residents with the mess.  2) Accountability. A good deal of the time, that board of directors is best pals with the CEO. Negative customer / public feedback can be mitigated with marketing - there are old VHS tapes put out by Exxon's PR team extolling how they lept into action to save alaskan wildlife after the valdez. As an aside: the CEO during that fiasco did not lose his job over it.  3) Corporations, because of the way compensation is structured, have a bias towards short-term gains that boost the stock price, even if the smart thing to do is work toward a long term improvement.  4) For the valued employee-citizen thing, check out the Pullman Town. It was, shall we say, less than ideal in practice.  Edit for #5: 5) Corps aren't actually very efficient. Things like pointless all-day meetings, constant re-organizations, and firing a layer of middle management so they can add a new layer of middle management are commonplace today.

Shadowrun,389zgi,insert_topical_pun,6,Sat Jun 6 11:31:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a somewhat shortsighted approach to corporate government.  For the purposes of this little essay thing, know that I'm talking about large, national or multinational corporations - not smaller ones, unless otherwise stated.   While the CEO and Board of Directors decide where the company goes, the direction is usually beneficial to shareholders alone.  Your average low-to-mid level employee won't see the effects of a business deal unless they're directly involved.  More profit means more profit - less profit means cut wages.  The company is under no obligation to pay you more or treat you any better unless you, specifically, have a say in how things go.  Additionally, slow government is a double edged sword - on one hand, things get done at a snail's pace, and change takes real time and effort.  On another, governments have trouble pushing things through at a pace so rapid as to make their citizens unaware it was ever passed in the first place, leading to a good system of checks and balances.  A corporation can make similar decisions behind closed doors in one meeting without employees/citizens ever knowing. If the leadership is doing a good job according to the shareholders.  Cutting wages to warehouse employees to push out some more dividends or pad the pockets of investors is, in the company's eyes, a good thing.  In a society where a corporation isn't checked by government, unionization goes away, the right to strike goes away, and the right to express your opinion may very well go with them.  You just have to bend over and take it.  In Shadowrun, if you express your distaste for your mother corp's actions, congratulations, you've just become SINless and turned out to the streets.  As far as governments go, you're vastly underestimating the things that do get done.  Public highways, health care subsidies, utilities, public education, inalienable rights, minimum wage - all of this is done by a government that must play its hand to the people it serves, given that it's a democracy.  If it were an oligarchy, corporate governance or dictatorship, the leader(s) could simply make it how they felt it should be.  Having a term limit is a way to dissuade a leader from going mad with power.  There are plenty real world examples of major corporations having to be checked by government because a long-standing CEO started to overreach with his power.  At the end of the day, the CEO and Board of Directors are still human. The CEO will be replaced if they're running the company itself into the ground.  If the company is doing well while simultaneously running slave camps out-of-country or (God forbid) on extraterritorial ground, then the shareholders will say ""stay the course"".  I'll agree that it's more difficult than it should be, especially with corruption playing a hand, to remove sleazy governmental officials from office, but I'll take that over shareholders threatening to vote in no confidence because a CEO proposed giving their employees universal health coverage. Large corporations have entire departments dedicated solely to public relations.  It's very much the idea of shaking your hand while stabbing you in the back.  They might send out their PR guys to make speeches about how they're funding a charity group for the next month or two simply to distract the consumer base from the fact that they're opening a chemical plant along the shores of an otherwise pristine river.  You might know what they want you to know is going on, and you might know what they're after, but you'll be hard pressed to know how they're doing it.  Look at Coca-Cola in regards to the World Cup fiasco that's been going on.  They're playing a large role in the bad conditions over there, and actually spun it (at one point) to be a good thing.  When things went crazy, they did a complete 180, but only because they were discovered doing it.  The bottom line being ""continued existence"" is a bad thing - layoffs, wage cuts, benefits being taken away, etc.  And if you don't have a government to creates checks as to how and why corporations can do these things, you effectively end up with a profit-driven dictatorship.  Both governments and corporations want power, it's just that corporations want something else - profit.  The larger a corporation gets, the more hungry they get for these things. Precisely.  Customers (consumers) matter more than citizens (employees).  In a democratic country, you have dedicated ways to make your voice heard, even if it is by voting.  In a corporation, you might have a ""suggestion box"", but unless you're a shareholder you're not going to be making any decisions.  What I'm seeing here is flaws in the democratic process (which absolutely do exist), but that doesn't exactly support corporate governance in and of itself.  It just means that government needs more work.  I also think you're vastly overstating consumer opinion - not in the effects it has, but in how prevalent it is.  If you're 70 years old and the government sends you a notice that they're cutting back on your social security payments, you'll be angry.  If you've been drinking Coca-Cola for 60 years, you probably won't care if (and it's a big if) news manages to come to light regarding their poor humanitarian practices.  You'll just want a coke.  The bottom line is that most people don't care or aren't informed enough, and the corporations can often pay news agencies off.  Those that do care and vote with their wallets often pose less of a profit loss than it would if the company stopped the unethical actions they were taking to make money.  And that's just customers - I'd argue that employee opinion matters less to large corporations (as a general rule) than citizen opinion does to government. They often don't.  Not with big ones, anyway.  A government is the sum of its parts and its beneficiaries, where a corporation is the sum of its ability to make money and its leaders.  A valued employee might have it okay, but someone who's there because they need to be (such as a warehouse worker) could be paid with dirt and scrap metal if there weren't laws to say otherwise - and if you had citizenship with the company, they'd simply remove you if you complained or tried to rally the troops.  Now, this isn't universal - there are good companies and there are bad companies, but the pattern seems to be that the larger a corporation gets, the more unethical its behavior becomes.  In Shadowrun, all of the major corporations are multinational, and they're all more powerful than governments, and they're all after two things: profit and power.  I'm not arguing that governmental bureaucracy is perfect, but I'd say that it's far more desirable than government leadership.  Bureaucracy is necessary for large things, governments included when they get to a certain point.   I'd say it's perfectly dystopian.  This is one of those systems that would be perfect if we could trust everyone to be a good person, but we can't.  For that, it falls in line with anarchy and communism - perfect on paper, assuming everyone is a perfect person, but in practice, there's a lot that can (and will) go wrong.  Thus, Shadowrun."
Shadowrun,389zgi,SpaceTurtles,0,Tue Jun 2 22:11:43 2015 UTC,"I feel it's less dystopian from the perspective of the individuals within the corporate state though.  I mean regardless of the government, you're screwed if you're ""SINless"" in today's status as well.  Homeless people have no effective rights or say in the way things go, you're exploited (though legally that shouldn't be allowed, it happens), and life seldom improves.  At least it can in today's world, and in Shadowrun it's unlikely to happen, but this isn't about the people working outside of the system, this is about world governing systems.  To address your concerns in order:    Yes, employees don't get a say in the direction of the company, the leadership is out to make things better for the people who have an actual stake in the company.  I mean, corporate drones are corporate drones in any age, even now and in Shadowrun.  But in the world of Shadowrun a company employee who is kept happy is productive and provides a consistent work force generationally as well.  It's in Renraku's best interests for instance to make sure their employees (particularly their brightest minds) are treated well.  In this case though the leadership model alone is really what's interesting, a corporate hierarchy has the unilateral decision making abilities to enact new business plans and expansion goals.  This is good because it means when something goes wrong and needs fixing, stuff actually gets fixed in a few months (or weeks, or days, or hours, depending on the severity), where as a democracy can't even vote on fixing broadcast rules for 2-3 years.  This is balanced by the mobility that if the customer base (in this case the average citizen) doesn't like a certain publicly announced decision (and for this system to work there would have to be transparency, because citizen taxation essentially means everyone is a shareholder), it can be reversed as quickly as it is enacted based on public opinion unless the unpopular choice is actually beneficial and nobody in the short term is seeing it (like a switch to actual universal health care in the US, similar to Canada and many other countries).  Yes, examples of overreaching power have been made in the past, like the ages past (now) subject of whether Microsoft was enacting a monopoly, or the more recent merger attempts for ISPs in the US.  I think as long as a proper terms of employment could be ratified by such a government system though, a fair system would emerge.  For example:  In Logitech there's rules in place for reporting harassment to superiors or others should your superiors be the ones involved, you're entitled to well delineated benefits, regular reviews for advancement, maximum periods before a quality of life adjustment to pay rate must be enacted (so you aren't stuck making $20/hr forever when others are supposedly getting $30s in other companies).  Again the leadership model is what's important, less so the employees of the company model (though government employees exist, so corporate government employees now?).  In this case for the average citizen/shareholder/customer may like that their company government is doing well for educational options, but medical coverage is lacking.  Being a shareholder effectively, if the murmurs of inadequate healthcare is a concern, a quarterly financial review can see a swifter change to that system than our current one.  The idea of a governmental corporation wouldn't have the ability to outsource itself.  It would be ""the United Corporation of America"" for example, representing a CEO and smallish board of directors in charge of the current USA, looking to make the country ""profitable"" by way of keeping its citizens happy (in this case, their business is PR with the power to enact changes to make people happier).  I'm happy to have the ability to submit a vote of no confidence in the CEO because he's proposing something ludicrous (like everyone gets a free car) if it means a new leader that has potentially radical but actually practical decisions (like universal healthcare or a dramatic shift in electricity generation away from fossil fuels) could take over.  I disagree about companies wanting power.  They want money, and money gives influence, which is as good as having power.  But you can at least always trust that a company wants money, because that's how they stay alive.  A government stays alive by just existing and having sufficient military might.  In this case though with a government based on corporate control, citizen opinion reflects their bottom lines.  They can actually lose money if they don't keep their citizen shareholders happy.  A present country's government though makes it illegal to withhold pay due to taxation laws.  You can't reside in the country if you aren't paying taxes; they extract what you owe, throw you in jail, or kick you out (effectively, you're SINless then).  There's no incentive to do right by the citizens, just incentive to promise a lot of pleasant things.  Once you're in office, you can backpedal on all your promises and as long as you aren't doing things that are illegal (which, legality is dictated by that same government anyway, so...  Overreaching power is still an issue) you can't really be removed.  Sure, I can promise everyone in my area gets a kitten if I can be an elected official, but I don't actually have to make good on that promise.  Citizen in my original post is more a reference to current government citizens rather than the corporate government citizen.  You are right that there is no need for the CEO or board of directors to even care about the suggestions of its employees, customers, or shareholders.  But they do need to care about their ability to stay in their seats, and the shareholders (the citizenry who pays their wages) are the ones who can remove them.  A wholly unpopular decision (like going to war (maybe?), committing no money to education, removing a minimum standard of living for public rights, etc.) would quickly get the board in trouble and could likely see a turn over of half of the board in a few months as things get corrected.  The corporate government would have to acquiesce to its citizens, lest it be forcibly removed.  Meanwhile our respective governments the world over get to do whatever they please with no real recourse.  A majority of people can't say ""screw sending billions in aid to another country, we have homeless people here and infrastructure problems that need fixing"" and expect anything to get done in the current system, even if most of the citizens say as much in public forums or in casual conversation.  A corporation government would have to listen to that and consider whether they're going to be keeping their jobs next quarter.  As for ""it directly affects me"" versus ""it doesn't affect me, I don't care"" opinions such as being 70 and losing out on social insurance versus wanting a coke in spite of Coca-Cola being a bunch of ass hats, I argue that the same is true regardless.  I'm in my 30s, a change to social insurance payouts when I'm 70 doesn't affect me at all right now, and I don't care.  But I'm also a disaffected individual who believes governments are ineffective at doing anything except wasting time, so I care very little about what the government is doing, because I can't actually change any of it.  Employees matter more to a company than citizens to a country in that to a company, a valuable employee is worth keeping and worth keeping happy.  But an employee that doesn't do their job is easily replaced, or if someone is doing better than they should for their status they may get replaced by a cheaper alternative (automation for shipping, for example).  Governments though don't care that you're a citizen as long as you pay your taxes.  There's billions of citizens, and any one of them can stand in for another as far as the government is concerned.  This one just wants money because they have a broken leg, this one's 65 and gets social insurance, that one's married and makes six figures.  The government only cares when it's not getting something its ""owed"", and then pursues that with great earnest.  Behind on your taxes?  Fuck you, pay up now or go to jail, and we're charging monthly interest regardless.  But if you're owed money like from tax returns?  You might see a cheque in a few months.  You won't get any interest payments, no ""sorry for the delay"", no expedited service to try and make things right.  Within a corporate government structure, if ""payroll"" is consistently behind on payments, the employee(s) responsible for that may not be employed much longer, which honestly is as it should be.  But that's ""government employee"" status rather than ""being employed"", which could still be possible within the world.   And it's really that last sentence that's important.  It isn't that there's now one company ruling all within a country and no company shall be worshiped/bought from before it.  It's a company that guides other companies.  Coca-Cola, Google, Logitech, they can all exist within the country.  But the country's governance is itself done by a company control scheme.  If you aren't employed by the government, you are still employed by someone else, just as it is today.  I may not be a tax assessor for example, I may be a doctor.  But I'm still employed, and still a citizen/shareholder of this theoretical corporate government.  In the Shadowrun sense though, you make some very good points about the multinational influences of the companies and their apathy toward their employees.  They can outsource work to cheaper labour markets, they can replace employees without due cause, and they don't have to listen to public opinion as long as it doesn't affect their bottom line."
Shadowrun,389zgi,rejakor,3,Tue Jun 2 23:47:55 2015 UTC,"This is a very rosy view of corporations.  Generally, corporations empower psychopaths via diffusion of responsibility and rewarding lies, waste time and resources, encourage the creation of a dangerous monoculture, and make up the difference by screwing over other corporations, the consumer, and the poor.  It's a lot of the flaws of both military and bureaucratic organizations with none of the governmental oversight of either.  None of this is particularly hard to find out if you've formally studied either history or sociology."
Shadowrun,389zgi,felicidefangfan,2,Wed Jun 3 04:12:36 2015 UTC,"You've made some good points I agree with (especially the 4 years not being enough to establish long term changes), however there are two points I feel need to be addressed:  1) The company cares about bottom line (profits) not people. Now you might argue that by keeping the customer happy they keep profits up - this is true. However they only care about the paying customer. Take for example sweat shops - the company doesn't give a shit about the poor child laborers working abroad for next to nothing, they only care about the people with money to be had. In shadowrun this is taken to an extreme which is what makes it a dystopia (How many sinless died from the fumes/toxic exhaust from that factory you just opened downtown? noone cares as long as the cost of covering it up doesn't exceed X nuyen. How much should we pay the arcology workers to produce Y product? very little, and then we'll set up shops within the arcology that we own, so that everything we do pay comes right back to us.)    2) The main difference (and reason for all the paperwork) is the number of people involved and the source of the funding. Lets take a large company like google (53,600 employees) and compare it to the US (301,3000,000 citizens, we'll discount illegal immigrants as they are essentially sinless for our example).  If a google employee files for some money (expenses of some kind) then there's only 53,000 more sets of expenses requests to consider. When a US citizen files for money there's 5684 times as many people to consider.  Now lets look at where the money comes from - google will get money from sales and advertising etc as part of their business plan, the government from taxation. Profits (post tax) are essentially money you can do what you like with, because at the end of the day you earned that money, you are not accountable to anyone about what to do with it. On the other hand this means if by your own hand you fail to make any profits you are not entitled to anything, a company can go bust and then all those employees end up with nothing.  A government on the other hand is there to set up infrastructure that everyone can use. They take money from everyone and as a result are accountable to them for how its used. A government can't be allowed to fail and lose all its money, because then a country loses its vital infrastructure."
Shadowrun,389zgi,Klugen,2,Tue Jun 2 21:53:54 2015 UTC,I wanted to write long reply to you but before I'll do it I want to ask you one thing.  The first big question I have is - who will be the customer? Will the main customer of corporation be their own worker or there are the external customers? (Shadowrun system when we have corporations and states).   If there is no other states and we have only corporations left then I don't think that their workers will be able to choose products of what company they gonna buy which means that there is no need to think about public reputation of the company as the client base of the company will be always the same anyways.  Of course if we use the Shadowrun model with corporations and other states then corporations will have to care about reputation and customers which makes your points viable.
Shadowrun,389zgi,Klugen,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:19:22 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that the corporate government would treat everyone, everywhere as customers.  But only its citizens, the ones who pay it taxes, are like shareholders.  As with anyone else that has a say in such structure, they can withdraw their financial support or summon forth a vote of no confidence if they believe that the CEO and/or the board of directors is doing something damaging to the long term stability of the company.  Withdrawing support would be effectively ""leaving the country"", so that's probably not something they would do lightly (I wouldn't want to stop being Canadian for example, though the CRTC pisses me off a lot).  The company government's main stock in trade then becomes ""make all the people happy"", and they get paid to run the country well in the long term.  Public works, security, education, international negotiations for resources, etc.  Their bottom line is making their own shareholders happy (their own citizenry), but just like Coca-Cola or Google, they want to get everyone on their side and potentially expand their income.  If people buy from your country's products, you're infusing more money into the country.  If people like your country, they may join it.  If you have services that your country is known for (like the best doctors in the world, or the newest education system in the world), their services might be called on (the government could offer incentive programs to pay a citizen a small amount to go abroad to offer those services elsewhere temporarily, like hiring from a temp agency where they would get more money in return from the hiring country but their citizen would be paid a fair salary anyway by the hirer)."
Shadowrun,389zgi,pfm1995,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:36:17 2015 UTC,"I think that your vision of company driven countries is a bit utopic.  ""the ones who pay it taxes, are like shareholders"" - this is a first quote that I have questions about. I can't say that I know really a lot about existing companies but I doubt that every worker in a company is a shareholder. It is a common practise for high level managment to have bonuses in a form of company's share but even they usually don't have an impact on company's development or actions as they are usually minor shareholders and the only people who can have an impact are major shareholders. Basically the only thing that minor shareholders can do is to ask for financial records. Of course there are some other ways how shareholders interact with the company - for example spanish sports socios (I hope that I wrote it right) - even being the minor shareholders they can vote for a president of the sport club but it is an exception as far as I know and to be fair I don't think that the real life equivalent of Shadowrun megas can work with such a model.  The main question I have after reading your second paraghraph is - who will control the company running a country or even who will grant a permission to the company to rule the country. If (for example) we have a company that controls Germany (like SK) than this company may stop caring about making all the people in the country happy as there is noone who can prevent them from doing whatever they want. They can even stop their people from leaving the country with sort of iron curtain. In the situation when we have only companies ruling all over the world the drifting of man resourses will be limited much harder than we have now. You don't want your customer base (and your customer base is equal to the number of your citizens) to drive to the other company. And you don't want to loose your ""brains"" to the other company."
Shadowrun,389zgi,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:08:23 2015 UTC,"Oh I've no doubts that such a system will be perverted.  I hold humanity in the highest regards when it comes to shanking each other over the basest of things.  So while the posting may seem to portray a corporate government as a utopian solution, it's really just meant to be a ""better than our current government systems"" solution, for the time being.  As I mentioned elsewhere, we've evolved different social hierarchies throughout the years from simple village elders to raving despots in totalitarian dictatorships, communism, and ineffectual as balls democracy.  Nobody wants a dictatorship or military rulership, because we all like our civil liberties, but the simple fact is our governments run on autopilot because the people ""in charge"" keep arguing about which way to go, and get paid to do nothing.  Literally, there are considerations in place which are decades and centuries old which were put there for a time when getting to the government meetings was a multi-day or multi-week ordeal, and you weren't expected to attend all the time in favour of guiding your own region properly.  But those considerations are exploited now to allow people to glide by in the government, getting paid for doing dick all for more than half the year.  Nobody can vote to change those considerations though, because people tie up the motions to have them revised in arguments.  I want that job.  >V  Anyway, moving on.  There are some companies that offer shares to their employees at discounts, or in lieu of part of their payment.  But the idea here is that you aren't an employee and thus replaceable, even though you own shares.  You are the funding for the country and thus valuable, because if you withheld your continued funding, and enough other people who shared your views withheld your funding, the company would see a significant loss.  Functionally this is no different than today's standard, every citizen pays taxes in their government in exchange for the rights and law governance imposed within that country.  I'm a Canadian citizen, I get free basic healthcare, so life saving surgery is a right bestowed by the country that I pay for through taxation.  But in this current system, elected officials in a democracy are seldom focused on guiding their country properly and are instead looking at getting re-elected and raising the money to do so.  Every few years you need millions in campaign money that you raised somehow outside of government spending (because a president would get an unfair re-election advantage if they could spend the nation's money on their campaign versus another individual).  So part of your term in ""service"" to the country is raising funds to do it again.  The other part is advancing your party's agendas, and this is where the majority of the slow down happens.  One group wants one thing, a second group wants another, a third wants something in between the two.  And so they bicker and cajole and connive, and then they realize nobody is going to get anything done and move on to another matter.  And the cycle repeats.  Sometimes this is grand, like using it properly to block an unjust law (see recent Rand Paul filibuster), but that's a law actively being blocked versus a new and possibly beneficial change being enacted, like reforms to healthcare or education.  I mean a change to US security being called ""historical"" because it's the first change since 9/11 is telling about how glacial and impractical the government is.  The idea is to replace the arguing with a group of individuals (appointed by the citizens) to run the country, and then let them run the country.  But we're in an age where feedback can be taken en masse in real time, so public opinion is no longer something you need millions of people to poll, you can just straight out announce you're doing something and get feedback from everyone on it in hours or days.  People are aware of some form of corruption within all our governments, but we can't do anything about it.  You can't turn to the government and say ""I'm reporting you to yourself for having corrupt ideals"", because who's going to make them behave?  Other governments can't step in, because that's a foreign policy issue and wars start over that.  The citizens can't rise up and overthrow their government, that's sedition and by most governments can be punished by imprisonment, exile, or death.  So election of another individual whom you hope has the right idea and your best interests in mind is the only answer available.  But as I mentioned, the system doesn't allow for any elected official to actually do productive work in their terms in office.  A CEO can actually point the company in a direction and unless he's considered insane (and a new one appointed by the board of directors, usually from within that board) things happen and the company does its thing.  Elon Musk for example has had a lot of crazy ideas in the past 5 years that are actually panning out, like Tesla and the partial vacuum train thing.  But while his ideas are ""crazy"", they're more ""crazy awesome"" and less ""are you mad?"", and his company reflects this.  Bill Gates and Microsoft is another example.  Innovative for its time, DOS and eventually Windows became a majority standard in the home and in business (no matter what we might think of the OS itself).  Bill Gates was the CEO for a long time, then handed off control to Steve Ballmer, and now Satya Nadella leads the company as of last year.  But that's a span of 14 years from when Bill was in control, to the newest leader.  Arguably the company is seeing an upswing from the previously unpopular views given to it (see ""every even numbered Windows released""), and their impending Windows 10 is being touted by many as a positive thing overall, so I'm guessing Satya is doing well, and the free upgrade for a year is making everyone out there in computer land happy.  But you have to think, giving away a product for free is pretty crazy.  That's not a thing that will make shareholders happy (per se), but long term it'll pay out for sure.  Satya isn't being replaced, the board of directors is quelled by reasoning (of some sort), and the company rolls on to bigger bucks."
Shadowrun,389zgi,Valanthos,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"I think that probably the single biggest issue with your 'country as a corporation' model (as I understand it) is that you haven't really defined how the corporate model would enforce the removal of employees from either end of the spectrum, as well as some specific problems with advancement.   Removal of the top: The biggest mechanical question I have about this system is how you decide when to call for the CEO's resignation. Do you take regular polls of everyone in the company's opinion of him? That would prevent him from making any of the 'hard, but necessary' decisions transparent and return us to a situation very similar to the one we have now with potentially even more abuse (what's the difference between a state-sponsored news agency and a PR department, and is there anything forcing them to report the truth?). Do you leave the decision to a small subset of the employees, like, for example, the heads of the various departments? This isolates the corruption and gives you a small group of men you have to bribe, rather than a large number you have to convince. And who is the one willing to call for the, presumably recorded, vote against the mad dictator? I don't have an easy answer, but I think that any system with enough checks and balances to prevent a dictatorship from developing would wind up looking uncannily like a democracy without the Bill of Rights or term limits.  The Whole: Every corporation needs some form of delineation in order to ensure business is done and done well. You could argue that countries have this as well with the division between the President, Judges, Congress (and it's various sub-delineations like Minority Leader), and the generic 'citizen', but corporations, I would think, need to have much more granular distinction between roles (indeed, every employee needs to have a specific role) to function effectively. Corporations also need to have some method of advancing through the ranks beyond reincarnation; the good work of the disciplined and competent needs to be rewarded if you want to avoid the traps of communism or Janteloven (and thank you to /u/avataRJ for pointing that out; I hadn't heard of that before). If we were to create a corporate-structured society where the needs (and rights) of the meritorious are considered more important than the needs of everyone else I think it is more than likely that change would slow to a stop: those on top would be extremely resistant to any change in the system that clearly must work because it promoted them, didn't it? To use your own example, the USA Freedom Act, I think it highly likely that anyone who was promoted for being good at fighting/railing against terrorism would be dramatically opposed to the USA Freedom Act because it curtails the powers they see as inherent in elevating them. We would also probably see an increased rate of like promoting like (no diversity laws here), so, if this corporation had been started in the 40s, the top half of the pyramid would be filled with old white men and I doubt the middle rungs would look much different (if you're an old white guy who thinks women should stay at home with the kids, are you going to promote a woman or a young white guy who thinks women should stay at home with the kids?). The easy way around that would be to have some sort of metrics-based performance but I would bet all the money in my pockets that that company would fail within two generations for being unable to adapt. Even if you could work out some kind of completely objective merit-based promotion system you would still have the problem of what to do with the deadbeats. There are some people that, whether through fault of their own or not, are unable to make a contribution to the company (i.e. it costs more to employ them than they produce). If your corporation is a country, what do you do with these people? You can't deport them, no other corporation would take them. Do you put them on the corporate equivalent of welfare and leave them as a negative in the books? That goes against the purpose of the corporation. Do you demonize them in the media and have them euthanized until you can develop some combination of gene and drug therapy to force them to be productive workers? And what do you do when an otherwise productive worker's political views or other non-work related opinions start costing more money than he's worth? The same?   I don't really see any way to create a government modeled on a corporation without it sliding quickly into a dystopia. It sounds to me like you're looking for a way to improve the speed of Congress while ensuring that they still follow public opinion. The problems I have with that are two-fold. First off, Congress does (generally) follow public opinion, it's just that everyone wants something different and the few laws we can all agree on are usually bad ideas or toothless. Fixing the problems with Congress has a lot less to do with reforming Congress than it does with creating and informed and curious public who are willing to read beyond the headlines and look at the reasoning behind legislation. Or, more simply and (slightly) less utopian, are willing to say 'I don't know' rather than thinking they need to have an opinion on every trade deal or negotiation with a foreign country. Secondly, and relating to my last point, public opinion shifts wildly with the whim of iron you see on Facebook or similar sites. Remember the taking-hostage of some 200 Nigerian women and girls that the internet worked itself into a furor over a while ago? Based on the level of public opinion involved, the US military re-tasked satellites to try to find these girls. They assembled a massive amount of information and scheduled a meeting with the Nigerians to discuss how to find them and get them back. They even brought the donuts. The Nigerians never showed. Millions of dollars worth of man-hours and equipment wasted because the American public cared about something and wanted to see something done. This happened again with the ebola crisis; we sent hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical equipment and medicine that rotted on the docks because the locals wouldn't let it in without an appropriate bribe. Following the public opinion of the day is no way for a government to function, and, I would argue, actually distracts from the real issues no-one cares about like infrastructure or the deficit. If you've ever read any Heinlein, he wrote that ""the tragic fallacy which brought on the decadence and collapse of the democracies of the twentieth century... [was that] the people had been led to believe that they could simply vote for whatever they wanted… (sic) and get it"". I don't think moving to a corporate-based model would change that; it would simply retard change as a whole."
Shadowrun,389zgi,avataRJ,2,Wed Jun 3 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"A fair point, I'm just thinking out loud really in this post.  In a typical corporation the entity itself can't be dissolved by the removal of the leader, he's simply replaced.  This usually happens from within the board of directors, or named by the previous CEO if he was stepping down on cordial terms (like Bill Gates naming his successor).  The new leader is chosen from and by the board of directors and the shareholders (in this case representing the citizens of the corporate country voting on a new leader from within the board based on publicly available records of their work).  The board of directors would ideally have only ""final say"" options to break ties, because their direct voting on the matter would skew the results too harshly if they got more than one vote due to their station.  Bribing and such is still an option, but at least everyone knows it's a thing rather than ""You shouldn't bribe, that's against the law that you wrote!"" right now which nobody can seem to enforce.  It's not ""bribing"" by big oil's part to keep electric cars and power alternatives stymied in red tape, it's ""campaign contributions"" which are putting candidates into office who are sympathetic.  One is illegal, one is legal.  >P  Who gets appointed to the board of directors?  Well there obviously must be a hierarchy to the government, just as there is now.  Workers do their jobs in their departments like they still do.  There's payroll (IRS), there's security (military), various other divisions for things like healthcare, education, laws, etc.  And just like now, there's the people who do the actual person to person work (the people at the DMV renewing licenses and administering tests for example), the people who manage those locations, the people who manage the locations in a region (like state level DMV guidance), and upward to presumably a head of that division (the leader of the department of motor vehicles; with a central database of vehicles, licenses, and who determines the rules of the road).  Advancement is already a thing within a government hierarchy, though with a corporation foundation you could have people who are uniquely qualified for a position go directly into that slot.  Like hiring a new regional manager for the healthcare division straight out of the CDC, versus advancing a person from within who might be a registered nurse instead of a doctor.  The heads of the various departments themselves may be that board of directors, or they may answer to a group of people above them, who in turn answers to the CEO.    How do they get removed from the top?  Who gets to say that the CEO is unfit for duty and should be replaced?  Any significant number of shareholders (perhaps arbitrarily determined based on the citizen population, like 1 000 000 people, or perhaps a percentage of the population), or majority group of the board of directors can call for a vote of no confidence.  This would then prompt a vote from the shareholders and the board (with the board having a greater say, to prevent troll groups from calling these votes up regularly and offer some form of solidarity to the leadership) leading to the CEO's continued power (if 3 of 8 board members say he should stay, but 70+% of the population thinks he's doing a good job for example, where the public overturns infighting within the board) or dismissal (maybe 7 of 8 board members like where the CEO is going with his ""free pancakes and gold bars"" policy, but 95% of the population wants him out, so he's out).  This I believe works the same way in today's corporate structure, though obviously shareholders have significantly larger stakes in the company based on shares owned.  The corporate government would still adhere to the idea of one vote per citizen to prevent people like Oprah from throwing money around for their ""give everyone a new car"" policies (it's not the government's place to buy everyone a new car, Oprah can do that herself.  >V ), but the idea is the same.  If there's a 51% population grump level that the current CEO is doing a bad job, but the board of directors is still mostly on board, the CEO gets to stay on the proviso that he shape up and make people happy again.  With regards to deadbeats within the corporate structure, simply, they are let go and much like today, they're left to fend for themselves and find a job that isn't part of the government.  There's a lot of gold bricking happening within the government though, so I can't really see someone actually caring unless there was gross negligence (not showing up to work, being mean to the citizens, filing things incorrectly on a consistent basis, changing output to read ""Super Bitch <name>"" on communications to the citizens (gg Comcast)).  But again it's not the idea that a corporation rules the landmass in opposition to another corporation, more that an entire region like...  Scotland became a corporation modeled government, and all the businesses within it still operate on as they always had.  So not being employed by the corporate government, that isn't the end of the world.  There's still Google, or Wendy's, or Home Depot, or any number of other independent businesses out there.  As for metrics about who's performing well within the corporate government, as long as they're actually doing and not existing I personally think that's sufficient.  I don't care that the mail gets to me in 3 days or 5 for instance, as long as it gets to me.  Currently my mail gets to me a month or two later, and that is not acceptable, and people have been replaced over that.  I wish more would, and not from the postal service.  It's not so much speeding up congress, because I don't live in the US and I don't care about governments in general.  But democracies exist in a good number of the worlds, and every example I've studied shows they don't get much done, or if they do their actions are in opposition to the public's views (like the stupid shit going on with anti-encryption laws in the UK) with no recourse against it (a public outcry for a vote of no confidence in that matter would get that turned around in a hurry).  I literally have no recourse to the stupid shit that the CRTC does.  All I can do is write an angry letter and it will be quietly shredded along with last month's campaign contributions from Bell, Rogers, and Shaw.  Even if I got a majority of the population of Canada to agree that the CRTC needs to revise all their laws for the 21st century and knock out nonsense like a minimum percentage of Canadian content in anything shown within the country (it's a thing, and a big reason Canadian Netflix is so much more sparse than the US), they don't have to listen, because they're the government.  Only someone higher up in the government can impose those sorts of changes, and they can't, because they're either for those policies, being paid to be for those policies, or will argue a nonsense point to delay a decision on those policies.  In a corporation things are a lot more agile.  Sure it may take a week or more sometimes to requisition someone to hang a picture in your office on an actual hook or something rather than being taped up or tacked to a cubical wall, but actual public outrage about a bad decision will usually be corrected in just as short an order (Microsoft's turn around with regards to the Xbox One for example just days after its unveiling its DRM and enforced Kinect bundling).  They can do it because the corporate hierarchy allows for decisive action.  The CEO, the board of directors, the heads of those departments, they all have the power to enact change on those sorts of things with proper approval.  Their actions are granted from within, but approval is judged from without as well.  If the corporate government suddenly started raising taxes and isolating groups of people based on medical histories, people would definitely start complaining about that and ask for a rationale.  If that rationale makes sense (like people exposed to ebola being isolated for a month, or perhaps even just a new flu strain being isolated for a few weeks for study to try and find a cure.  Or additional taxes being necessary for reason X which will in turn give everyone Y) then people quiet down.  We don't get that right now (mostly).  Taxes increase, minimum wages decrease, immigration seems to be a problem (even though it hasn't changed at all over the years if you study it), and people just grumble and accept it because nobody explains the whys or hows of these changes.  But shareholders have direct information on their company's earnings, holdings, and decision making.  They can learn those whys.  I also can't refuse to pay my taxes, because that means I get thrown in jail, though that's an option that could be allowed in a corporate structure.  If you can't get a change you strongly oppose, you give up your sponsorship of the corporate government, give up your citizenship, and move elsewhere to join another country that's doing a better job.  Literally voting with your wallet.  A mass exodus of people could be possible in that scenario where an opinion is so unpopular, but still upheld somehow, that the company country literally loses millions of dollars as their shares evaporate.  Or you could live SINless.  No rights, no support, but you don't have to deal with some ridiculous policies that would make life for you impossible.  Like a lack of encryption directly opposes the idea of free speech, because then seditious talk via email to your friend about how the government is unjust and needs reform could find a government agency's personnel in your neighbourhood the next evening, quietly interrogating you about your anti-state thoughts.  I would rather live in anarchy than exist in a world like the one portrayed in Equilibrium (for example), and I would gladly give up citizenship if such a police state existed."

The Jante Law as a concept was created by the Dano-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose.  In his novel A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks (En flyktning krysser sitt spor, 1933, English translation published in the USA in 1936) identified the Law of Jante as ten rules. Sandemose's novel portrays the small Danish town Jante (modelled upon his native town Nykøbing Mors as it was at the beginning of the 20th century, but typical of all small towns and communities), where nobody is anonymous.

However, considering the typical cyberpunk tropes, corporate power is concentrated and the main concern of the corporations is those who hold the shares. If the CEO holds a simple majority of the shares, it's effectively a President-for-Life post.  There are historical examples of both good corporations (Fordism, for example, was quite progressive for its time) as well as bad corporations - McJobs might be quite close for the situation in Shadowrun. There's considerable workforce (SINless) available for entry-level jobs. So unless you are truly skilled, you're replaceable.

In SR5 it just introduces a penalty equal to its strength.  Those are usually created in areas that has seen a lot of violence and misery. Any place with strong emotions.

Shadowrun,388k2v,marwynn,5,Tue Jun 2 16:57:36 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. As for fighters... I've had something like a fighting pit idea running in my head. Actually, similar to Fight Club.  So Orks are usually at the lower end of the economic pay scale. Most choose to go into debt to have skillwires implanted. They're bio-drones, more or less. Hosts apparently feed them their skills and jobs for the day.   So take the Fight Club idea a bit further. These Orks (maybe even Trolls) who are literally wageslaves are forced against their will to fight.   You can have a pudgy generic worker Ork be a combatant. He's been given Rating 3 skillsofts but his real talent is being able to take a beating.   How's that for a moral crisis? For added mind-messing, it could be the same metatype as the player, maybe resembling a wageslaving relative. It's not them, of course. Or it could be a single mom/dad working to feed her kids. Hell, they're Orks, so it could be the eldest of the family. Gotta underscore the misery of this all."

Shadowrun,388k2v,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:53:33 2015 UTC,"They don't want people using cyber implant weaponry (retractable spurs, etc..), so Killing Hands would probably be seen in the same light.  I guess an overseer Mage(s) could be in charge of making sure nobody casts spells, or instead of just watching the Mage(s) could be ready to Counterspell at all times. Either way I'll need some suitable punishments that don't ruin the fight if someone breaks the rule. To the bookie it's all about having a winner and a loser. They don't want to have to break up a fight, that would be like throwing away good money."
Shadowrun,388k2v,CitizenJoseph,3,Tue Jun 2 18:11:39 2015 UTC,It's an illegal fighting pit. Honestly people would pay more to see the cyber weapons come out. We did a run with a fight pit and everything except guns were allowed and you couldn't have someone cast spells on you. You fought until you couldn't fight anymore or your surrendered
Shadowrun,388k2v,CitizenJoseph,3,Tue Jun 2 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed, especially if its known in advance about the weapons being present.  Even an uneven match would be good - betting odds would shift and the crowd either gets to see a plucky mundane out maneuver the better equipped foe, or they get to see a cybered up man tear another to pieces"
Shadowrun,388k2v,CitizenJoseph,2,Tue Jun 2 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"These sort of fights typically have some provisions against (and rules) magic use.  The simple fact that this is a pit of depravity can create and maintain a background count which would hinder adepts.  It could technically be attuned to a specific domain, but I believe only full magicians have traditions which allows the use of domains.    Actually, Tucson is Aztlan territory so all this effort to making an illegal bloodsport is going to pale to the Government sponsored bloodsport of Courtball.  And Aztechnology seems to be able to create fovae (magic dead zones).  They'll also attune these arenas to blood magic most likely, and feed off the energy to power their own magics."
Shadowrun,388k2v,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:03:37 2015 UTC,"In my game I have PCC and Aztechnology in contention over the area as PCC constructed the walls to protect Tucson during a particularly bad sand cyclone a couple of years ago. The Big A has a lot of sway in the city, though. It's a smuggling route for them, so as long as PCC lets them use the roads Aztechnology lets PCC control daily life.  I'll look into fovae, and I think Background Count will work perfectly for reducing Physical Adept powers and a Mage's spells(?).  As you mentioned blood magic, it would make sense that the Big A is actually the true unofficial sponsor of the fighting pits. That will give me some background to weave in down here. The group's last job was for Aztechnology, and this would make them feel suitably bad for doing such a good job at it :)"
Shadowrun,388k2v,CitizenJoseph,3,Tue Jun 2 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"Stick it in Mission San Xavier del Bac.  It is a very old Spanish Jesuit mission dating back to 1770.  That is a lot of religious imprinting on the area.  Then, when Aztlan declared that religion illegal, it gets taken over and the domain altered.  That gives you a good kickstart for a background count and then continue feeding it blood to keep the domain active.  Next door is a school, which you could keep as a orphanage sort of thing.  I recommend, if possible, that you also put in some sort of winery, maybe saguaro cactus base.  So you can show them as doing good, and the popularity of the locale as a landmark and tourist location, then finally you show them the seedy underbelly.  Even after that, they may not even know about the true usage of the place as an amplifier of their magic tradition."

But you don't tell them about the background count before they get there.  At the Mission, if it is an adept fighting, he's going to have to give up a lot of his adept power.  He's still got to win several matches to swing the racist to bet big on him.    It is important to get everyone involved, so they may need to put a second character into the games to help protect the 'champion' from getting shivved in the showers.  The decker will be needed to keep tabs on the mark's finances and the face needs to work some social magic to convince the mark to bet the way he needs to.  Hopefully the magician will be able to do some healing afterwards, but he's going to be hit hard by the background count too.  He will however be the first one to see the bigger picture about the blood magic domain feeding the Aztechnology agenda.  Ideally, mucking with that domain, or getting the mark to think that it has been swung to the champion's favor will convince him to bet big or change the odds to favor the champion heavily."
Shadowrun,388k2v,korgash,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"I laid out my group's strengths and weaknesses in the main post via an edit.  I think I'll have 2-4 of them fighting. If anyone (aside from the medic) sits it out it will probably be one of the mages.  I like the aspect of having to protect yourself between fights. I'll definitely want to play up the fear there.  We don't have a Decker, so either the finances will be an unknown or they will hire an NPC to do it. Since they are doing their high loyalty contact a solid they will have to eat that cost, but they have had some lucrative runs lately, and I think they can afford it.  I'm not sure how to run ""the dive"" as far as the rules go.  Maybe they could hold back dice/successes on their evasion roll and make an Acting roll to compensate with a Threshold equal to the number of dice/successes they withheld. I don't want it to be overly complicated, of course there is always a chance that they get beat fairly (and roundly).  Actually, dick move or not, that was the plan (to move them to the Mission after they have proven themselves). That way they go from magic being a no-no (but few people are really watching) to actually losing spellcasting dice and potentially having their spells targeted by a Counterspelling Initiate.  The Hobgoblin is the one I expect to take this all the way, and he's the closest thing we have to a Face, so he has pretty decent acting skills. They might just pull this off if they can make it into the upper ranks."
Shadowrun,388k2v,felicidefangfan,2,Tue Jun 2 20:03:14 2015 UTC,"Like I said. Watch Diggstown.  The only way for the bookie to make money is off the people betting against the champion.  The only way to burn the bookie is to get him to book the odds like 20 to 1 in the Champion's favor in order to convince people to bet against the Champion.  That's where making him think the fix is in on his part comes into play.  If the group wants to twist the knife, right when the hobgoblin is winning, have the fixer stand up and call into the arena, then turn her thumb down.  That's when the hobgoblin shrugs and drops his guard, falling to the ground from a light hit.  Since most of the crowd bet against him at massive odds, they aren't going to complain about a dive.  The bookie however will have to pay out massive winnings or face consequences."

By that argument, since Increase Reflexes isn't in the 'Augmentation' chapter, it's not a 'magical augmentation'.  Overall the rules are completely unclear.  Capping initiative is fine, extra IP are really powerful, but the rules don't do that and the highest-cost initiative boosters are also the weakest, so you can and should houserule it with a better version.  But trying to twist the wording around to fix it is probably the worst way to do that."

I agree, Increase Reflexes is not Augmentation, however it doesn't matter since it says it doesn't stack with them. I was misremembering the wording in my previous post actually, but I'm pretty sure that it would still work, especially when you take RAI into account. Cram is probably just Amphetemines or Awakened Amphetamines, which are pretty easy to make out of ephedra. About as technological as cast bronze or iron, nowhere near a cpu.

It's only single-shot, though, and has a very low magazine size, so you'd probably want a backup with it. For that, you can't go wrong with a T-250 short. If you want something with serious weight to it, get a Krime Boss and slap a smartlink on it to help with its garbage accuracy."

One day a PC tried to use it to kill a horror that was grappling and tentancling to death another PC, critically glitched, and shivved his friend right up the butthole with a knife that couldn't be removed.

For example, in my current campaign, the players did a run for the local Yakuza, who now owe them a favour.   I feel like runs where they come in close contact with some new, top of the line tech are completely viable, though I probably wouldn't do it too often. Similarly, powerful foci might be found, but would still cost karma to bond. As others have said, powerful artefacts would be an entire campaign, or a large part of a bigger campaign."
Shadowrun,386v3t,barnsleysfern,4,Tue Jun 2 16:18:07 2015 UTC,Magic in shadowrun is not magic in dnd. In fact you need to be awakened to use magicical stuff.

Shadowrun,386v3t,WhatWhatHunchHunch,0,Tue Jun 2 11:38:54 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling, shadowrun players are not to keen on handing out these things. Maybe it's the world with its magic securities or just the science fiction background?   It's probably because magic doesn't work like that in Shadowrun. The closest you get would be foci or enchantment magic. Both are only usable to Awakened individuals, and enchantment is a temporary affair at best.  That said, it's your game so run as you see fit.  Personally I lean towards throwing more ¥ or karma at the players rather than loot. Occasionally they might nick something on a run, but usually that's more hassle than it's worth what with RFID tags and change of ownership (unless they just burn the tags and keep the item/pawn it on the black market)."

More specific queries are often answered hastily here.  After a few games of playing you should have a firm enough grasp on the rules and some gaming conventions to GM.

While there's sourcebooks for most aspects of the game, I'd suggest sticking with the core book for starters. The rules there for magic and the Matrix can be tough to deal with alone, nevermind adding Street Grimoire and Data Trails to the mix. You can introduce those books later, as you start getting into it. Barring maybe Run Faster, but that's pretty light on new rules while offering lots of new options for players.

On a related note, remember that drones can do suppressive fire. Nothing simplifies an escape plan quite like three rotos suppressing an entire corpsec response team.  For utility must-haves, you need a Fly-Spy. More than one is nice. Put them all around the area of operations and either monitor what they see or get a level 1 agent to report movement to you. Alternatively, if you don't mind losing a little versatility and don't mind the cost, a single Optic-X can take the place of a handful of Fly-Spies, and is a bit more agile.  For vehicles, the classic is the GMC Bulldog step-van. Armored, large enough to carry the entire team, and can be easily painted to look like a delivery van. If you don't need to carry your entire team and want to go fast, check out the Shin-Hyung. If price is an issue just get a Jackrabbit. No one ever suspects a Jackrabbit of being a runner car.  In esoteric drone-related stuff, the smart firing platform is essentially an immobile drone that you can stick somewhere as a backup. Cover the exit, leave behind a nasty present, or just glue half a dozen of them to the roof of your car before heading into the Barrens. Great little gadgets."

But, you know, for practical stuff, having a small cloud of Fly-Spy drones would be very useful both before, during, and after the run.

That said, it just really irks me that they both cost 7 points, and one gives a +2 to one skill, while the other gives a +2 to two skills.  Then it gets even worse, with Codeslinger, which costs MORE to give a +2...to only one action type with one skill.

You can put points into Pistols, SMGs, Shotgun, or Rifles and more points unlocks certain kinds of attacks: Aimed Shot, Burst Fire, Full Auto, etc.   I wouldn't want to limit firing options to the skilled, but it may make sense to introduce penalties for using burst or full auto unless you're much better trained with that weapon."

There's an assumed online mode that you don't need to actually involve at all to have fun.  Keep in mind your npcs are people and therefore not gods, and you can always throw new challenges at them instead of trying to shoehorn them into failing somehow so your old challenge is relevant.  Six roto-drones chasing the party through an abandoned building guns blazing is more interesting than making up a thermal sensor in order to force them into a gunfight with the Knight Errant security guards on the premises."
Shadowrun,380mhn,rejakor,3,Mon Jun 1 01:41:39 2015 UTC,"Plus, remember that every security system is designed on three metrics: Security, Ease of Use, and Cost. Depending on where you are the three are going to be weighted differently. For example, a secret MCT research lab underneath Everett / on an island in the South Pacific / on a dirigible is going to be very heavily weighted towards security; cost isn't and issue and they don't want visitors. MCT Seattle HQ is going to be weighted more towards ease of use; there are lots of people moving in and out constantly and no executive likes to be strip searched before coming to work. Finally, a MCT subcontractor's office supplies warehouse is going to be weighted more towards cost, because ""Who cares if the security system only works one day out of fifteen? It's only a few paper-clips"". Shadowruns happen when those three priorities clash and an opening is created."

Basically for Adepts, I take initiation to be 'pushing the limits' in grueling/dangerous ways. I dislike hand waving it, because i like it to be a milestone of sorts.

They have to go do something suitably impressive that pushes their norms (as a runner).  If they just finished doing that something, then yeah, handwave, go up one level.  Magician initiation for me typically involves some sort of astral quest or the acquisition of a rare reagent somewhere for use in a ritual, unless they're part of a magical group.  The group as a whole can act as guidance for the character and end up doing a journey to an astral location together, where in the character ends up doing something special, usually with the group's mentor spirit or something.

If possible, a solo game in-between normal sessions would be best. At the very least it should cover what the Initiation was all about and what they got out of it.  An Initiation is a perspective altering event. They understand themselves and magic at a higher level, perhaps realizing that they knew so little in the first place and still have much more to even attempt to learn. Those who like Astral journeys in our 4A games were suddenly faced with elements of their backstories.   Once, I haunted our street shaman with the ghosts from her Big Regret quality. For our razorbunny adept, I did a ""Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future"" thing for him to show him what could've happened had he not sacrificed Essence for some sweet 'ware. It wasn't necessarily better outcomes, just different, and it gave him a sort of peace.  That said, they could also be the source for unconventional runs. You need to acquire special reagents, get some payback/closure, and generally give your characters an opportunity to just be.  Submersion's the same thing. Our games ended before I could finish my plans for our TM player, but he was getting weird messages from Sprites at all hours. Especially during runs.   But if your games are more action oriented then handwave away."

Also, if you need a holdout piece that will work with your revolver specialty, the Colt New Model Revolver from Gun H(e)aven 3 isn't bad. Low damage, but very high accuracy for a holdout.

I'd definitely consider it otherwise, or may pick it up later.  My revolver/second story adept just uses a LightFire 70 for non-killing/quiet shooting because it's not like 15 dice isn't enough to put a capsule full of Pepper Punch in a dude's face.

Shadowrun,380w80,joha4270,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:55:19 2015 UTC,"From what I know about the Nagant, it took some hand work to make sure that everything mated properly.  It also took special cartridges with the gas seal.    Since you can get an easier seal with a semi-auto pistol, with stock ammunition, I don't believe anyone would bother programming the autoforge for such an antique.    I stumbled into the gun because I was looking for a pistol that could fire AK rounds.  Now, the AK 74s and presumable the 97's and 98's of shadowrun most likely fire something along the lines the the 5.56  mm.  The AK-47 fires 7.62 x 39 rounds, while the Nagant pistol fires 7.62 x 38.  It seems to me that the brass from an AK-47 could be shaved down a bit and repacked for Nagant ammo.  There is more to it than that, but the main idea is that this character likes to use the same rounds as much as possible, reloading casings to avoid a paper trail."
Shadowrun,380w80,Bamce,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:43:47 2015 UTC,"Now there is a slight problem with that plan. This is a 7.62 x 39 compared to a 7.62 x 38.    Simply won't fit. (Googeling a little more i found this, showing them in the same picture)  Now while this in unfortunate, there are some things that works better. This fires the exact same bullet as this.   Machine pistols are pistols that can fire automatic. Submachineguns are slightly bigger pistols that can fire automatic. If you wan't to reflect this in rules, let machine pistols and light pistols share one ammo type and heavy pistols and submachineguns share another. Thinking about it it might fit better with machine pistols sharing with holdouts and submachineguns sharing with light pistols, but i need somebody who knows more about ammo than me give a concise answer.  Rifles are a whole different breed, as their catridge have different shapes and are quite a lot bigger."

But I'm going to rob a bank while they alert the HTR for the facility (Renraku - the place with the server farms) and piss off a lonestar accounting office on the lower floor to cause not one, but three HTRs to come to the location. The job is a skyscraper that is mostly renraku owned, but the bottom floors are a lonestar accounting office. Then next door, a good 10 meters away, is a bank. If nothing else Renraku will have their own guys, the bank has a private contract, and Lonestar has their own guys. So 3 HTRs will show up at the same place, with 3 different goals, and step all over each others feet trying to figure out who is in charge, who is leading the deal, be unable to set up a perimeter - causing enough confusion and chaos to buy us at least a few minutes. During that time, they will slip out in uniforms for one of the 3 HTRs on site."

If the company is large, you're on another floor. When they badge in to go back to work, you step in with them. Clearly this is a job for a solo face with maybe some matrix support to help research.  Usually this plan fails because you have a lot of do-wop ""backup faces"" that when hearing your plan want to Me-too it. Which makes the story more implausible. A lot of social engineering techniques like the above work just fine, but run into serious problems when you are part of the typical ""me too"" runner team.  Its why I don't play Faces anymore.

Shadowrun,37xtj8,PinkTrench,5,Sun May 31 23:31:29 2015 UTC,"I think the best trick I have used for Micro-corporations is improvisational office party.  To be fair you need to be able to use a good quality decker.    Step 1: Buy large amounts of party food: Soda, Pizza, Ice Cream, Etc.  Simultaneously research a high manager who is effectively insulated from his staff 90% of the time.  Step 2: Have Decker hack into system and send notice to Security that the pizza guy will be dropping off food into office.  He is checked in and escorted to a meeting room where he drops off huge amounts of food.  He should tie up security in doing so.  Step 3: While the the food is in the building spam out to the entire office party that a manager has splurged for Birthday Party/Celebration of Accout Success/Morale Building Meeting/etc.  Free food in Conference room A.  Make themselves at home until that manager arrives.  Step 4: Enter the building and perform the run while everyone is tied up.  You should have allot of noise in security and people away from their workstations allowing runners to slip in unnoticed.  There is also a decent chance that security will also be partaking of the free goodies.    Step 5: Do the job quickly, we have found this plan will allow 20-30 minutes of an effectively clear building.  (Double that in a low morale building.)  On the way out it helps if you send a email in house to that manager about the 'morale building exercise he ordered 3 months ago taking place now in the conference room.'"

Shadowrun,37v1yb,TheMagicalFarmWizard,3,Sat May 30 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"In many ways this sounds like it needs streamlining, not 'fleshing out'.  Perhaps try placing these events or traits on a timeline and plotting them into each other so they create or support each other better.  Right now, the character comes across as more of a mess of random stuff rather than anything coherent."
Shadowrun,37v1yb,rejakor,2,Sat May 30 17:29:08 2015 UTC,Timelines are a solid idea for characterisation. I solidly recommend it when players are trying to bring the pieces together.
Shadowrun,37v1yb,Valanthos,1 point,Sat May 30 20:55:18 2015 UTC,So like a general story of her life?
Shadowrun,37v1yb,Sebbychou,2,Sat May 30 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"A little bit of causality would help. Also, defining the ""why"" of these events.  Things like ""Why are her parents not giving her the attention she craves? Is it because they're distant or because she's narcissistic?"" and ""What makes her feel oppressed by the corp if she's not even part of the system (homeschooled)"". Hell, "" How did the parents manage to homeschool their kid in the first place rather than the corp forcing her into the indoctrination program?"", and well, what corp was it in the first place? And especially the sadistic tendancies, where the frag does that come from and what caused that gaping void in her psyche to need to be filled with violence? Is it a hand-me-down from her parents? The environment? The medias? A mental illness? Is it just social osmosis from her family being security riggers for MCT? Etc.  Understanding what causes the stuff you want for your character is primordial to make it believable. Writer's sandard characters have three layers of ""Why"".   Why X trait Why the cause for X trait happened Why the cause of the cause for X Trait happened"

Shadowrun,37tp5w,CitizenJoseph,10,Sat May 30 09:12:29 2015 UTC,"The metagame out there is that neither the players not the GM want to end the game.    When the players do stuff that make it unfun for the GM he is likely to TPK the group.  When the GM makes it unfun for the players, they are likely to sabotage the game from their side of the table.  Frankly, if you're not having fun, stop the game and say so. But if the dice come down bad, don't let the dice ruin the game. That's where little plot devices like this come into play."
Shadowrun,37tp5w,Tinyturtle75,4,Sat May 30 15:06:40 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.  I'm thinking of it as a one-time-only, very expensive Get Out of Jail Free card, just in case the story goes sideways and the GM can't think of any other way to believably keep the game going."
Shadowrun,37tp5w,CitizenJoseph,3,Sat May 30 16:43:18 2015 UTC,"Something I explained to my players is that they don't have to fight to the death, if they get captured they have needed skills they are going to be put back to work.

Shadowrun,37u0lj,Valanthos,1 point,Sat May 30 20:49:01 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting way to do it, but let's be clear on the differences between Street-level and Street Scum: The first are mostly very green shadowrunners. The second is intended for civilian/NPC level play. Both are really neat ways, but Street Scum is an entirely different approach vector to the world than Street Level.   Maybe one assumes the runners are entering the shadows and one doesn't?  I like the idea a lot. Definitely gets people out of their boxes of isolated and confined attitudes about games.   As for the balance issue - that setup I'd have to try myself and see where it goes both short and long term."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,reyjinn,1 point,Sun May 31 13:42:06 2015 UTC,"You are right about what is intended with street level vs scum. Unfortunately the fact of the matter is that the str lvl rules are absolutely broken (as you are well aware). In my mind there are two possible avenues to correct this. You can either go through quite a bit of trouble by nerfing the entire priority table (such as dethstrobe has done) or you can keep the priority table intact but limit what people can select (which to me seems simpler). Someone mentioned doing Sum-2-(less than 10) and I would also think that that, like street scum chargen, would be a much better way to level the playing field without having to redo the entire priority table. shrug The street level rules, frankly, are dead to me because I believe we already have better alternative tools for what they were intended to offer."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,Bamce,5,Sun May 31 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"The street scum rules If memory serves work out pretty well in being ""balanced""  However I usually just build as established run a street theme game"

Shadowrun,37u0lj,NotB0b,3,Sun May 31 01:11:28 2015 UTC,"Street Scum, or just Sum to 8(Can't Buy As) works really well. Much better than the rules in the char gen section, which makes everybody play Magic-Run because Resources is nerfed and Magic isn't."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,korgash,1 point,Sat May 30 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling they're not meant to be 100% separate rules - if you want to play a gang with no real aspirations beyond the streets, then using both will keep you there.  Works similarly for High Life / Prime Runner."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,heimdahl81,1 point,Sun May 31 12:23:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  Personally I would Halve the amount of Special attribute points and Magic/Res priority, rounding up.  It means that metahumans like orks (Statistically known for their street level thuggery) are more attractive. It also makes it more difficult to start out as a super powerful mage (3 is the average magical ability of any given person, but 6 or nothing at standard gen)  It also means there's less edge to throw around. Is that a bad thing? Maybe not, if you're looking for a grittier and more visceral gaming experience. You're living life on the streets- you're NOT the luckiest guy in the world.    Just spitballing:  If I wanted to make a human mage, I would priobably go CBADE. That's give me 6 magic, 2 edge, 5 spells and almost no cash or skills.   Whereas, If I wanna go an ork street sam, you could go CAEDB, Buy some basic Used Muscles and Used Wired 1 and get a pretty even spread. You're strapped for cash, but that's the point."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,RussellZee,1 point,Sat May 30 12:38:45 2015 UTC,I see riggers more as pilots in a street game. not buying the control rig would guive you access to an other vehicule or 2
Shadowrun,37u0lj,Modernpreacher,1 point,Sat May 30 15:47:37 2015 UTC,Agreed. A rigger without cash is a driver or a smuggler. Jumping in is for the rich. The rest just use their body.
Shadowrun,37u0lj,rejakor,1 point,Sat May 30 22:46:29 2015 UTC,"I think the easiest way to create a ""street runner"" game (without using that chart, which is just a ""poor runner"" game, screwing folks who need nuyen) is to modify the priorities folks get.  Maybe use Sum-To-Ten from Run Faster, but grant eight points, or nine, instead;  something like that would put an overall crimp in the power curve, lowering it significantly, while not unduly lowering the curve for only mundane, equipment/augmentation-bearing, characters."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,rejakor,1 point,Sun May 31 03:57:39 2015 UTC,"We're starting a pre-shadows campaign. I basically did a standard start, but requested players not take more than D or E for money unless authorized.  Realistically skills and stats make sense to me to be higher in this type of setup.  Magic is tricky... I tend to just let them spend the points, but lock abilities on a character to character basis to limit spell selection at start, but allow them to unlock through play not long after.  Seems to be fine.  Our rigger is basically a mechanic with an old beat up car. A damn good driver that will eventually become a rigger, with his VCR and supped up machines. But right now, he's just a guy working in a garage tooling up cars."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,heimdahl81,0,Sun May 31 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"here's my kludge-   everything numerical you get from the priority table is halved (this has the side effect of making non-human metatypes more attractive, which I like) the amount of nuyen you get is divided by 5, not halved (want 'ex-military with crappy cyberware' to still be a thing, but don't want gilletted to the max stuff) skill cap is 5, attribute cap is one less than normal at chargen availability 8 or lower without Restricted Gear quality   This setup means you can have a magic 6 mage (A and B spent increasing it with special points), straight out of chargen but they have nothing else.  Note that extra skills and spells and things from being a mage or techno are halved as well  you could very easily just say 'you can only know 3 spells or 3 CFs at character creation' to limit that, too.  EDIT:  The reason I talk about magic here a lot is that magic is the thing that functions the best 'on it's own', it needs the Magic stat, a skill, a known spell (or none for a spirit) and BAM it's nearly as powerful, whereas the other archetypes hinge more on synergies between numerous skills, attributes, etc.  That said, you still WANT the 'street kid with powerful magics' character to be possible in a Street game because it's an interesting story element."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,rejakor,1 point,Sat May 30 11:33:06 2015 UTC,"Availability under street level is 10 - Why should it be lower?  I'm not quite understanding the Skill cap - can you explain why you did that?  Nuyen is the fuel for non-mages. Can you tell me about that change, too?   Your street level sounds overly tough at the expense of the other archetypes. How has it worked out for you?"
Shadowrun,37u0lj,heimdahl81,2,Sat May 30 11:47:24 2015 UTC,"There's too much stuff that doesn't fit the milieu at 10, I liked 8 a lot more. To discourage specializing in a few skills or attributes with the fewer points my street-level rules give.  I'm sorely tempted to lower the skill cap to 4. Street level is supposed to be gritty.  The best way to simulate gritty, I found, was having crap gear, crap SINs, crap comms, crap or no drones, crap decks, crap cyber, crap everything.  Literally not wanting to bribe the guard Y300 because that's a significant chunk of change for you.  Not starting with 5000 nuyen because you can't afford to.  Seriously thinking about Squatter vs Street lifestyle.  Etc.  It removed a lot of options and made all the characters considerably weaker, which is the goal.  Mission rewards are similarly scaled down.  It means a longer (long enough for a character arc) time at Street level, as doing jobs is harder and takes longer and you get paid less.   Non-mages vs mages.  I run my games with Astral security, as the book tells you to do so.  Most gangs have an awakened member, or can call in a favour from one, corps provide astral coverage at facilities remotely, etc.  Ergo I felt comfortable having potentially (at a ruinous cost) magic 6 characters as Street level runners.  Using a spirit or spells is a beacon on the astral, and is like pulling out and using grenades.  It's 'Going Loud'.  In my games, going loud means you need to pull out soonest.  The book goes out of it's way to reiterate that astral security is a thing and using spells is like using assault weapons - it's loud, obvious, and quickly draws retribution.  Enemy mages can quickly come from far away and shut you down, if you do so and then don't immediately go dark (stop perceiving, send away spirits, turn off focii).  Ergo, in my games mages can't just go buck wild with spells and spirits, and therefore are perhaps less useful than in games where the GM doesn't bother with that part of the setting, and it requires mages to have other stuff to do, or at least be semi-competent at some other stuff, for when they can't go on the astral without getting ganked by wagemages #1-6.  In games where mages and hackers aren't limited in any fashion, you could institute a maximum Magic score, but that kinda feels like fixing a leak in a bucket by sticking your finger in it.  Plenty of stuff is hella overpowered at even low magic scores, and can be overcast, and without the 'astral response' limiting factor the only thing stopping it breaking the game is gentleman's agreements.   How has it worked out for you?   A lot better than regular Shadowrun, actually.  The low-level, gritty challenges help fill in the setting a hell of a lot better, and everyone scrabbling for points to try to cover even one set of competencies forces teamwork a lot more, much more of an 'Ocean's 11' or 'The A-Team' sort of stuff going on than the regular shadowrun characters.  Instead of a mage 1337 enough he can just Magic all problems, instead you've got a mage who is scared to Magic in case that rumour of a 'monster' is a bug spirit and he needs to be in tip-top form to manabolt it while they all run like hell, and the street sam who doesn't just shoot through it because the two KE guys are probably his match when it comes to shooting, and finally you end up with the Elf dressed as a stripper delivering a candygram and smuggling the rest of them inside in a giant cake and you don't need to cover the building in turrets and spirits to force them to use some kind of actual plan."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,rejakor,1 point,Sat May 30 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like anybody with a magic of 6 would get snatched up to work for a Corp real quick. They better have a shit load of negative qualities that make them not take that path."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,marwynn,1 point,Sat May 30 23:06:57 2015 UTC,"That's true of anyone with a magic above 2, though.  And refusing a corporate job, in the world of Shadowrun, is not necessarily a negative quality.  The corps are pretty much factory-lining evil, just like in the real world."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,NotB0b,1 point,Sat May 30 23:15:16 2015 UTC,"Right, but at Magic 6 you have your pick. You could probably go to MIT&T on a scholarship. They would be throwing money at you. To someone living in the Barrens, it is a dream come true. All I am saying is that either they must have a good reason not to offer or you must have a good reason not to refuse (and the skills to not just get kidnapped)."
Shadowrun,37u0lj,marwynn,1 point,Sun May 31 00:17:48 2015 UTC,"Right, and wanting to tell those stories is why I left it in.  Same with the guy with 6 agi and 5 in pistols, that's Professional Rating 4 soldiery, why is he still on the streets?  Etc.  People can get trapped in lives and places without realizing they have other options, or rejecting them for personal reasons, or having some block or flaw with their talent that stops them being recognized.  The blossoming of people with skills into getting those skills recognized and using them is kind of the point of street level as I see it.  If they're actually crappy goons (and i'd run the hell out of a crappy goons game), simple.  'No skill or stat above 3, except for one skill, which can be at 5.'"
Shadowrun,37u0lj,korgash,0,Sun May 31 10:38:11 2015 UTC,"The Priority System makes this a bit difficult. Might be easier with Karmagen.  I haven't actually played a Street level campaign in 5E. But I wouldn't want any Awakened with Magic greater than 4 to start off with, same with Technomancers and their Resonance. Also wouldn't allow Essence to go below 4.0 either.  Skill-wise, I'd go with the old 4E rules for normal BP gen. You can get one skill at 6 but nothing at 5, or two skills at 5 and the rest 4 or lower.  Deckers and Riggers can do fine with lower rated stuff provided the opposition is suitable to their level. I don't know how to deal with RCC and Control Rig costs."

This will be the most important part of being awakened since it will form your understanding of magic for RP as well as a few mechanics like attributes to priorities and what kind of spirits you can summon.  After that you need to decide how you want to work your magic. Spell slinging, making potions and magic items with alchemy (not recommended for newbies, it requires a degree of mechanics mastery to make it viable), or summoning lots of spirits to do your work for you. I'd recommend just being a spellslinger since it's the easiest.  Then come up with a backstory. Why are you running the shadows and not living the life as a wage mage? Where did you learn magic, a mentor spirit or maybe you went to MIT&T or another college. Where were you born and into what kind of life?

Our face went to the investment company as a potential new customer or the representative of one. Unfortunately he was sent to an ordinary wageslave consultant who was immune to any kind of intimidation or con (damn you GM! ... or maybe because we could not organize a chopper). So he could not talk/deceive some of the higher ups. That consultant offered to call back and wanted a name from us including the companies name our face was representing because of background checks, etc. Our face rejected, coz our ""client"" does not work that way and is very powerful. But at least our face could scan the floor and spot the security design and patrol paths of the guards on his way out. (The floors are all similar with only a few minor differences)  What we did instead:  our decker hacked into the investment company, retrieved the list of staff and the security guards working there. First we fired that stupid ass consultant.... and then we stalked one of the guards who were working on that floor at that time where we had to break in. We went to his home, disabled him, our face took his close and put on a disguise as a guard. Luckily, our face could smuggle himself all the way through and got a very convenient patrol path where he had access to the doors in the stairways and the server room. So he could give the other runners a signal when its safe to get out. The other guards walked at the other side of the floor and never noticed a thing.    This run was pretty silent, nobody knew we were there. Well our face had to patrol the rest of the working shift, though."

Sequencer maglock pass key hardware kit locksmiths tools Thermite burning bars data taps data chips (get everyone a copy of the data so that if anyone gets captured you still have a chance of completion)   Exit  How are you getting out is more important than how your getting in.  What is the sewer system looking like? Is there a parking garage? What area of the city are you in? Nearby buildings?  If sewer exit is an option, You will probably want some protective gear from that. Possibly depending on the situation going and checking that out before hand and placing said gear there. Potentially even rigging some explosives to a spot to drop the floor out so that you can exit that way. From there take the sewers to your vehicle nearby, burn your sewer clothes. Drive off.  If there is a parking garage you will need to make sure you can feasibly get your vehicle in there beforehand, And have the preparedness to get past things that might stop you, like pop up barriers, and stuff.  Lower security areas allow for more dramatic things. However if things go off without raising the alarm you should be able to just calmly walk out the door.  If your mage has levitate (or the time to learn it) you could easily go back to the roof and levitate (possibly just use a strong physical barrier) across the gaps between buildings. Which may have a better/easier way of getting out/down. Or just flying off into the night. Which you should be careful about in case things get dispelled.    If someone is decent at explosives you can do fun things with breaching charges. Including using them to cut a hole in the floor into the sewers.  If you have decent amount of prep time. Solidifying your extraction plan should be the most important thing. As having completed the job and walking out to a mass of high security guys. just kinda fails the mission.  Some gas grenades+some form of knockout gas could be helpful.  A few drones to provide surveillance of the outside of the building. Some money could be spent on a disposable used vehicle Some on bribes. A few area jammers A round of fake sins could help"

Control device is making the target device do something for you.  So, lets say you wanna hack someone's cybereyes because they were silly and left wireless on. You can try smacking their commlink with a spoof command action then the commlink sends a fake command tio the eyes to bring up images of TROG BOOTY XVII and blind them  OR  You just go straight for the eyes and use a control device action to force their eyes to blind them.  Why does this matter? Control device is a INT + Electronic Warfare action and Spoof Command is a Hacking + LOG test.

That said, calling/dismissing a sprite is uh, not written well.  As written, you compile it, register it, and then if you send it to the resonance it loses all tasks.  So it's more 'well done, go home now' than 'i'll call you back later'.  They actually have to stay on the same grid as you at all times or they lose all tasks and disappear.  Catalyst:  Good at rules.  So you just use Simple Actions to make the Registered sprites hanging out in your commlink or wherever do stuff.  So, 2/pass.  They'd probably get the -10 to init for 'entering a combat late' as they were Tasked mid-turn.  That said, you can likely command a sprite to perform X task when Y happens, so if you're ambushing someone you can suddenly have a bunch of Crack sprites brick their guns all at once.  I doubt you could spend a bunch of tasks setting up code-words, though, both from how the sprites are portrayed (not sapient) and how setting tasks and the task resolving is described.  In general i'd be pretty lenient as a GM with keeping crack sprites useful, as otherwise you just spend all your slots on Machine Sprites and hand out Diagnostics bonuses to everyone.

Why? Turning off wireless is a free action with the correct interface. That means you can do it any time, so long as you haven't used your free action(s) from your previous initiative pass.

But I'm a bit worried that once someone's gun gets bricked, they are going to turn everything wireless.   Boring and inefficient. Its gonna take about a full combat turn to brick their gun most times. And then there is a decent chance most competent opposition will flick the wireless on their guns off on their turns. Possibly after the first attempt. The environment is your weapon. You can hack doors, building systems, everything else. Mage summons a fire spirit? hit the sprinklers. Retreating or chasing a target? close, lock and brick doors.    Hack their communication. What would I target   This is a good thing. Assuming they like your team have their communications linked to something. You get a mark on their commlink, translates up to the master a Snoop command will get you access tow hat your talking about. You could potentially (I would make you listen for a turn-2) send out false information to it. Pretend to be some kind of overwatch, sending them false information.   Hack their sensory gear, like their cybereye    Cyber eyes, are only wireless if they have vision enhancement wireless. Which most times they probably wouldn't be doing.

Hack a truck or car driving by. Spoof a command to drive it into an enemy   This..... this isn't as good an idea as you think. Yes, it is something you can do. However you are now bringing innocents into your combat situation. This will probably end up with a point of notoriety when you do it. In addition to potentially doing other things that aren't exactly good for your rep. And who knows who owns that truck you just wrecked, they might now be pissed.   Puppeteer someone with a datajack or trodes to change interface mode and jack into VR mid-combat   This.... gets sketchy, I would probably allow it since your using puppeteer and you will need 4 net hits on your target to get it to work. However remember that if they get another turn they can just switch from vr to ar.

Shadowrun,37tndn,heimdahl81,2,Sat May 30 18:03:15 2015 UTC,"You could indeed mess with contacts a little. But it wouldn't be to the same degree as cybereyes.

First, you can escape linklock via the jack out action  Secondly you'd need the program submersion as a techno to get the lockdown program to give you the option of linking someone.  then you'd need to start cybercombating someone.

However, for technomancers, that's out the window. Unlike a decker, you can't reliably brick two devices with every action you take. What you do have is access to Complex Forms and Sprites.  Fault Sprites are decent cybercombatants, but not as good as a decker. Of course, you could just have a bunch of them, and that would get you somewhere, but it requires you to have multiple registered sprites and spend tasks on all of them.  Your real role is matrix utility. When combat breaks out, your matrix powers are generally less useful than just shooting people. Suppressive Fire and grenades can get some really good results without having too many points in their relevant skills. Other than that, Puppeteer on a drone can be really fun."
Shadowrun,37tndn,VoroSR,2,Sat May 30 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"Here's what I have to work with.  I typically get 1, sometimes 2 initiative passes if I roll well in meat space.  Usually my first couple actions are to throw down a thermal smoke grenade and a flashpak while I dive behind cover.  Sometimes CS/Tear Gas Grenades and some capsule rounds (DSMO+CS/Tear Gas) from a light pistol or I'm firing burst fire APDS from my Savalette Guardian.  I have 21 dice for my pistols dice pool, so I can shoot rather decently-- I just don't get a lot of physical actions compared to the rest of the group.    Last session my GM let me take the Mesh Reality echo from 4e for my first submersion.  This lets me roll both my physical initiative and then my matrix initiative, and after I use and subtract my physical actions from my matrix initiative, I can spend the remaining passes on matrix only actions.  What I end up with is on average 1 meat initiative pass, and then 2 matrix only initiative passes.  So I want to be smart and find ways to use them other than ""data spike his gun""."
Shadowrun,37tndn,korusef,3,Sat May 30 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"Data Spike as a Technomancer is just so much worse than as a Decker. You just don't get the sheer amount of damage a Decker can get. (Unless you're an Elf with exceptional charisma, and have submerged at least three times to take the Hammer, Encryption and Fork programs as Echoes. Then you get to also add in Sprites helping you and put Deckers to shame, but, you know, karma cost is insane)  Other matrix actions are ill-suited to  fighting. Resonance actions are almost universally worse (for combat).  Maybe you can do something cool with Sprites and the Diagnostic power on your teammates weapons. Maybe you can Puppeteer the enemy decker's deck into data spiking himself or his team. Things is, for most fancy hacking, doing it in combat is the equivalent of a Face calling his contacts for backup while the bullets are flying. The time for that was 15 minutes ago, not now. The only difference is that with hacking, you can realistically get something done (frantically hack a door open while your team holds back a giant bug spirit, SR5 Core cover-style) , but it's still incredibly inefficient."

Shadowrun,37tndn,VoroSR,3,Sat May 30 18:34:20 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing with ""nearly as quick"" is that it translates to ""twice as much time"" a significant portion of the time. The difference in taking one action to do it and needing two actions is huge. Matrix damage doesn't do anything until it bricks the target, so leaving a gun with one matrix box left hasn't accomplished anything yet. That said, a human technomancer can still be very powerful on the utility side of things, and they can get close to an elf, they just have a few less dice."
Shadowrun,37tndn,Tinyturtle75,3,Sat May 30 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"Lets see (new player, so correct me if I screw up)...  A typical gun is device rating 2.  So it has 9 damage boxes and resists damage with 4 dice.  So to brick the thing in one go, on average, I would need a DV of 10-11.  If it is part of a PAN, lets say the firewall is 6.  Now it would resist with 8 dice.  On average I would need a DV of 12.  My current DV is 5 + net hits.  Submerge a second time for Hammer.  Submerge two more times to boost Attack of my persona.  Then I would still only be at 9 DV.  :("
Shadowrun,37tndn,UnfortunateTruths,3,Sat May 30 18:50:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's a lot easier when you have a cyberdeck with Attack 7 to start with.  Couple of things, it's arguable whether a Master Device's Firewall helps with resisting damage. There's a line somewhere about how Matris Damage is always resisted with Device Rating + Device Firewall. Basically, the Master device can help avoid the attack entirely, and it can reduce the number of hits, but it wouldn't help with soaking the damage. Talk to your GM about how they interpret that. (Also, maybe Data Trails clarified that. I don't own it yet. Yes, it is killing me. Love me some matrix stuff.)  You can also get your sprites to help you with it, either by throwing debuffs at whatever you're trying to brick, or by helping you directly. A teamwork test can add in some more dice."

It was the kind of thing you see from a group of people who really DO want to do right but don't really know how to get there.   It looks like alot of fun, but one of the worst calls was to price it the way it's priced on STEAM. The high price point doesn't hold up to the game when put beside other games of equal quality. They tried to go for big sale pops, trusting on the blind enthusiasm of the always hungry Shadowrun community and I'd say likely lost alot of potential players that way.

Cliffhanger weren't interested in making an actual RPG FIRST, just a tactical MMOG with IAP. The story is bonus. Development of actual characters and engagement with the world of shadowrun were low to zero priorities.  Other than the product being flawed and unable to effectively brand itself, MMOs are expensive and usually fail. The company could be done for either reason, but it's both, IMO.

Its whole purpose is to take out other vehicles that are attacking the convoy"
Shadowrun,37seeu,Bamce,3,Sat May 30 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"I recently designed a convoy for a run in my campaign, though it was transporting orichalcum instead of prisoners.  The convoy itself consists of 3 Ares Roadmasters with the goods scattered evenly throughout to minimize losses if one car got taken down. Each car has a heavy weapon mount on the roof with a Stoner-Ares M202 MMG (plus ammo), each turret controlled by a gunner using an AR interface from inside the vehicle.  To act as an escort, 6 drones divided into 2 groups. Group 1 consists of 2 Cyberspace Design Dalmations - their job is to fly ahead and ensure the convoy route is clear of obstruction, reporting on the nature of obstruction and scouting alternate routes if necessary. Group 2 consists of four MCT-Nissan roto-drones - they flank the convoy until anything threatening approaches, at which point they engage. Weapon mounts on the roto drones are 2 assault rifles and 2 assault cannons. The spider rigger running those sits in vehicle 3 (back of the convoy).  Up in vehicle 2 sits a mage - his specialty is barriers (he uses average force barrier spells to form ramps to try and flip pursuing cars). He will also be scouting on the astral plane to check for approaching magical threats. He has mage sight goggles while the van has a small exit port for the myomeric rope, allowing him to cast spells outside of the vehicle.  Should any of the roadmasters get stopped, the gunners, and drivers if still alive, will try and defend from inside the van until HTR can arrive as backup. Equipment for them was full body armor with helmet (contains thermographic vision and smartlink mods, as well as an integrated gas mask), assault rifles, smoke grenades (still able to see through smokescreen with the thermographic vision), combat drugs (if you feel the players took the convoy down too easily) and a rating 4 area jammer (to interfere with a deckers attempts to open the door or interfere with their equipment).  In my campaign the convoy was supposed to be secret, instead of matrix/radio call check-ins the convoys progress was noted using traffic cams by the destinations security spider. If at any point the convoy didn't reach a checkpoint at the appropriate time, then a chopper (Nissan hound for me, but an Ares Dragon could easily work for you) would be dispatched to provide an HTR backup. I had a 1D6 response time unless the players managed to divert the convoy from its main route, then a 2D6 response time while HTR attempts to locate them.  This should involve everyone on the team without much hassle:  A rigger (or other driver) should be obvious, as should any combat focused characters  Any mages should get challenge from the enemy mage  A decker can try and wreck the drones/interfere with the scouting drones/directly attempt to take out the vehicles systems  For a face I'd get them more involved in the legwork - after all your group needs something to stop the convoy right? For me it was arranging a deal with a corrupt building firm (Mafia controlled) to get them to do some unscheduled roadworks along the convoys main route.  For an infiltrator (and also decker/face) a minor legwork run to get into the host controlling the city's traffic light signals can create obstructions in the form of traffic jams"

Shadowrun,37seeu,rejakor,4,Sat May 30 10:31:24 2015 UTC,"So. We played the scenario today and it went better than expected. The convoy was made of 3 vehicles - 2 vans which transported people + 1 ramming vehicle. There was 2 drones which were making reconnaissance.  The ramming vehicle was because we're playing in east side, anarchistic Berlin where roads are usually blocked by hobos, tents, wreckage and stuff like that. There was rigger who controlled the drones, mage, 2 officers in the first car + 2x2 in the vans.  The group purchased explosives, area jammer before which they made use of. When the convoy was approaching the mined road, the decker quickly gained 3 marks on one of the drones and spoofed command about road being okay. Then when it exploded, the jammer was turned on and there was quick fight killing the bodyguards. Long story short - 6 of them were killed, mage escaped and 1 surrendered. When the HTR team hit by a chopper they tried to escape by a car but ended running into the sewers where we played short horror-like story with ghouls.  They freed people from one van, so I will give them extra karma for that, but unfortunately not from the second. The VIP they reclaimed go slashed by one of the ghouls when she was jumped on. I'll decide if the ghoul was sterile or not - but probably wasn't."

KE had a technomancer and was going to transfer him from the downtown Seattle station to Ares HQ in Bellevue. We pulled some face shenanigans to slip someone else into holding and pass a timed Slab pill to the guy, then the lawyer shows up to pull out our plant.  He questions procedures and civil rights and then rolls out to get an injunction.  This forces KE to transport the guy early before they can get full escort.  By carefully causing traffic jams we coaxed them from the northern route to the route going through Council Island.   But during one of the traffic delays, we planted an oil/smoke bomb under the transport.  They start smoking half way across the bridge and we report them to Council Island police.  They get pulled over for polluting Salish land.  The technomancer seems to die from the slab drug.  He gets rushed to Council Hospital per policy.  There he is declared dead.  KE gets harassed by the lawyer for improper handling of the situation resulting in the death of a suspect.  First Nation gangers then smuggle the corpse out into NAN lands and the technomancer gets a new life in Denver.  We never got to implement the plan."

Shadowrun,37seeu,lshiva,1 point,Sat May 30 05:43:18 2015 UTC,"Based on the rules for astral speeds a centralized hub in Denver could provide near instantaneous astral support for the entire continent in seconds. The slowest part is locating the specific location from the Astral. Which might mean you'd want to distribute mages so they can have specialized knowledge of the local landmarks. It only makes sense that a major security company like Lone Star would have mages ready for fast response.  A mage with a Spirit of Man to cast spells can respond faster than anything.   If you've got a mage on payroll it seems reasonable to have them ""on call"" to respond to magic related issues. Part of that would likely involve sending out spirits on simple tasks like ""protect these people until they get to the prison"". You're already paying for the guy, might as well get some use out of him."

Shadowrun,37t8th,felicidefangfan,3,Sat May 30 05:08:51 2015 UTC,"Well I mean, the Foundation as a concept is ""the players are entering an abstraction of this wild morass of data and server functionality."" But I mean, the current computer paradigm is that there are five abstraction layers between the user and the actual hardware. Unless you are physically moving transistor gates, every user input is a metaphor for something you want the computer to do.   That's kind of a long-winded way of saying 'just because the Foundation is funky doesn't mean it's really any different than any other kind of hacking'.

Shadowrun,37t8th,Malkleth,2,Sun May 31 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"So, I guess, to answer your question: because it is literally the same thing as you are doing, just with one fewer layer of abstraction, there is no reason you couldn't handle it the same way, with the main changes being: No overwatch score, no spiders, but your connection is locked open, you're forced to be in hot-sim, and it is extremely lethal. Bouncing from node to node inside a host is sort of like how older editions, and the various video games, handled the matrix.  You might look at first edition to see how those hosts were handled. There used to be like dungeon maps of matrix systems and such, and that might be a good way to approach a Foundation hack.

The PCs should be encouraged to look for all alternatives before hitting the Foundation to get a file out of storage. Of course, the Foundation's paradigm has 0 relationship with the rest of the host. So, what you can do is just prepare a handful of Foundation themes ahead of time, and just pick one of your predefined ones whenever the player wants to hit the foundation. They don't need to be prepared specifically for a mission, so you can just have a bank of them ready to go.   I expect that the community will start generating these after a while , so GMs will be able to borrow from each other as needed."

Their job is to delay and wait for HTR to come in and clean up.  Anyway, to the point, I usually do something akin to the first point.

Corporate CEOs are more or less the rulers of a nation as much as they are the head of a megacorp. And I somehow doubt that most CEOs (save Lofwyr of course) would be a match for a shadowrunner in combat prowess.  Anti-climactic, sure, but not at all unlikely I think."

He was a key member of the Echo Mirage team (as a developer, but not a combatant, iirc) who disappeared less than a year before Knight's nanosecond buyout in 2033. Chances are good that he did some ""things"" that would look like high-end shadowruns to get those pieces positioned.  Knight's has also had a series of leonization treatments to keep him in peak shape, and probably sports better-than-deltaware implants. Assuming he's actually Gavlian, he's probably in his 90's. I wonder how long those treatments will keep him going? (As long as the plot demands it, of course!)

Then you add Quirks, 3 per minor NPC (you can generate this on the fly very easily) -   Forgetful Ballet Cheese Fancier   and you suddenly have a Professional rating 2 Guard who is forgetful (forgets an important detail when the PCs interrogate him(but not on purpose), forgets his keycard when he leaves the guard room to go on patrol, talks on his phone with his wife trying to apologize for forgetting their anniversary), [X] ballet (maybe he used to be a dancer, or maybe he really, really, really loves the ballet and has it on the tiny screen in the guard room and is trying to talk about it to other guards or something), and has some relationship with Cheese Fancying.  Maybe he hates Cheese and Cheese Fanciers, maybe he is one, but the community and hobby of cheese fanciers and cheese fancying is in some way connected to him.  We'll name him, too.  His name is Jim.  Jim the Forgetful, Ballet-liking, Cheese-fancying, Corporate Security Guard.  Quirks can be any adjective, noun, and most verbs.  You pick three random words, apply them to the character, and create someone memorable.  Physical appearance stuff can be a quirk, but it then applies also to characterization - Greasy doesn't just mean not well kept up, the character is also creepy.  Fat doesn't just mean the person is a bit overweight, they carry themselves in that manner and are embarrassed about it and use it as armour or reverse that and use it as a club to bludgeon the world with.

Shadowrun,37qukt,Gavin42,4,Fri May 29 17:43:19 2015 UTC,"Why make a MEMORY test (Logic + Will) to sense another immortal. Traditionally, Intuition is the attribute used to sense or notice something. Doesn't it make more sense to make QUICKENING SENSE test (Intuition + Magic)?  And rather than grant the Immortal bonus karma for killing other Immortals, why not offer them:   The Immortal may purchase a specialization in any rating 3+ skill the recently slain Immortal possessed for just 4 karma and without any training time.  A single rank in any Knowledge/Language skill that the now-deceased Immortal possessed.   Initiation should follow the standard rules, but require that Initiation Grade +1 Quickenings to have been absorbed by the Initiating Immortal before the karma can be spent on a new Initiate Grade.  EDIT: What about the minor powers that Immortals possess?    Empathizing with Deer Breathing Underwater (since they cannot die of drowning) Any others?   I think I'd allow them to Astrally Perceive as well."
Shadowrun,37qukt,helionwulf,3,Fri May 29 19:41:20 2015 UTC,"I guess I, at some point created a mythology for the whole Highlander thing that had them all originating inside the same powerful being. So, their ability to sense one another was them accessing some shared ancestral memory. I guess that one would be unique to my game. Given what you said I think I would do Quickening Sense (Intuition + Magic) so that it becomes stronger the more heads you've taken.  I like the Specialization idea, it cleans up some of the skill creep that could happen in a long game (where they encounter/kill more than ~3 other immortals).  I don't think I'd do Astral Perception since Spirits and Magic are never mentioned in the movie. I can see why many GMs would, but I would withhold it to keep them from becoming too powerful.  Breathing Underwater I think I'd chock up to the regeneration, but if they did it for too long I would rule that they ""die"" and have to regenerate before they can continue.  Empathizing with the deer is a really tough one, though. If you wanted to include it you could reduce the cost of 'Immortal' by 0.5pp and let them spend the other half a point as they see fit. I think there are some rules for Physical Adepts sharing senses with animals in one of the 5ed books.  Thanks for the advice, really got me thinking :)"

Shadowrun,37qukt,Tinyturtle75,2,Sat May 30 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"As a throwaway I made one of the players contacts a double amputee who owns an old blues bar named Joe's. Haven't done anything with it, just wanted the option.  The series shows a lot more interaction between immortals so even if you didn't want to use characters from it you could base abilities off of it.   In the movies and the series sensing each other is a given. However given the heavy role flashback plays in the series you could have the memory test have a chance give them a clue as to who their dealing with if they encountered something similar before.  In both the movies and the series the concept of ""more powerful"" is poorly defined. It can't mean simply better at combat otherwise the newer immortals would never stand a chance. It can't mean combined head total either, as that leads to other problems. One possible solution would be have the immortal priority be A but magic starts at 1, They gain skills and karma normally, but taking a head gives them extra magic or edge. Players should be encouraged to burn edge to stay in the game, having something interrupt their inevitable beheading.  Other odds and ends, cyber would probably be a no go having the body reject it under normal circumstances. In the game world, immortals would be a highly prized commodity sought after by every corp out their. In the movies they are the top of the food chain but in a world with magic, dragons, and a wide range of weapons that would put down an immortal for even just a little while they become something that would be hunted and exploited. The series also has a secret society of mortals dedicated to documenting the immortals which would also be a thing. Immortal based technology is touched on in the books that follows the series, but I haven't read them because I draw my line at the series before they introduced the demon.  One other thing to take into account is the prohibition on fighting on holy ground, it's never explained in the movies. In the series it's treated as if their is some consequence enforcing it, and even the worst immortal is not willing to chance it. What that consequence is remains unclear, but the Vesuvius eruption is one potential result. As such all immortals should be able to sense higher ground through the quickening. Maybe some rules about how holy ground is made and lost as new and old religions both qualify and the main players never have to worry about moving their fight 50 meters to the left so they don't accidentally fight on some old holy site that isn't marked.  Another weirdness from the series that would fit well in the Shadowrun world is the possibility of being overwritten by taking the head of a more powerful immortal. It happens twice, once when a warlord is turned good and once when Duncan is turned evil and he redeems himself through an initiation like process."
Shadowrun,37qukt,heimdahl81,1 point,Sat May 30 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"The holy ground thing could be explained by ley lines. Holy sites ten to be built on ley lines (or ley lines shift to intersect at holy sites). The power of a Quickening injected into a ley line node could cause a massive uncontrolled release of magical energy. Immortals would probably need to have some sort of intuitive unconscious sense of being in a ley line node. Not quite Astral Perception, but maybe Magic Sense."

Essence loss from Supernatural creatures is where it gets complicated / interesting. Would you become mortal until you get back to 6 Essence, or would it return at an advanced rate similar to their Physical regeneration? Interesting questions that a group might want to investigate."

While I'm not totally up on the 5th Ed rules, you could have it that ""Immortals"" can use their karma. but only that gained by defeating another Immortal, to Initiate and buy further Physical Adapt powers.  You'd keep the same limits that are on them otherwise, and the same ones that exist for physical adepts for limits normally (or set some new ones), but it's through the quickening that they can gain new abilities and expand themselves, though restrict their growth there. That can add the element of whether they are good/evil and take every head they come across or whether the are more choosy about how they act and behave."

It could be failing a stealth check, killing someone that you're supposed to keep alive, etc. The goal is to make it hard for the runners, while maintaining the covert nature of the Judas. You don't want it coming back to the player cause the party will just kill him, at least based on my experiences.  As for who they work for. Don;t reveal it right away. Just make NPCs, ones that you can keep alive and the runners despise. Pick their favorite one to try and kill or screw over, and have him in control."

The player played it like a split personality--he'd be Stephen Colt, normal shadowrunner, and then he'd hear a code phrase from his KE handler and find himself plugging a chip into the server we were accessing to made the alarms go off. It didn't actually come up much until a couple runs before the finale of that campaign, after his handlers got tired of having him lead us into traps that we kept avoiding so easily that we didn't realize they were traps until later.  The point of all the above is this: the reveal should be dramatic, and there should be foreshadowing--if you do it right, foreshadowing that no one realizes is foreshadowing until it's too late. Judas is finale-grade material. Don't play story cards like that too quickly."

I don't like that assumption.  Treat it less like a bomb and more like a slow burn. Do something similar to 5e's Electronic Witness + Day Job with the character's agency. Alter / replace paydata.

The relationship with my ""brother"", picking me up after I did pretty much everything to fall into the gutter and take everyone with me, was for added drama, and I had planned with the GM that I would ruefully betray him to the big bad at the end of the campaign, but we never got that far.  I guess, all I'm saying is make yourself a Judas code, and somewhat stick to it as your character progresses and you get a feel for how he would act.

In older editions I'd even suggest that the host would trigger a reboot automatically, but today's matrix is omnipresent and can resist having even EMP nukage from blotting out parts of it.  I'd assume a full host reboot would be nigh impossible in this era."
Shadowrun,37pydo,Feynt,1 point,Fri May 29 15:36:21 2015 UTC,They could still just reboot and be back up almost instantly. Which is another reason to not try and fight back. As should you start to win they will just dump shock you

Shadowrun,37pydo,Forged_Fury,1 point,Fri May 29 14:34:20 2015 UTC,"It is.  Page 247, ""Host Attributes""   Hosts also have all four Matrix attributes: Attack, Sleaze, Data Processing, and Firewall. The ratings of these attributes are usually (Host Rating), (Host Rating + 1), (Host Rating + 2), and (Host Rating + 3), in any order.   This can go above the host's rating apparently, meaning the baddest of bad ass hosts can have 15 in a stat.  Good luck dealing with those attacks.  >V"
Shadowrun,37pydo,Feynt,1 point,Fri May 29 15:15:21 2015 UTC,"Well, it says IC share a Host's Attributes (p. 247, last paragraph/sentence). Presumably this includes using the Host's Rating as well. From that, you add the rule on p. 237 (last paragraph) that allows icons to use their rating in place of mental attributes for tests. That's why it may not be totally clear, lots of rules scattered throughout the book."
Shadowrun,37pydo,Forged_Fury,1 point,Fri May 29 15:25:29 2015 UTC,"It's implied that the rating is the attribute score.  Agents use their rating for attributes, while it uses the deck's attributes for things like attacking or what have you.  This is further reinforced that the host rating is the attribute score by way of the ""host rating x 2"" for all attacks that IC perform, standing in for <skill> + <attribute> [limit] from the decker's perspective."

The only spells you have at the moment which I would quicken are increase reflexes, increase attribute, and detect enemies, extended. Each of these is perfectly acceptable for your character to quicken at force 6, as that's higher than your will (allowing you to boost it up to your aug.max) high enough to get 3 extra dice to initiative, and far more than you'll need to have a decent detect enemies area. Instead of raising magic I'd continue initiating (probably going for centering first) to further improve your masking's ability to conceal your spells if nothing else. You could also start picking up more spells, pick up a good power focus, raise some of those worryingly low skills (such as sneaking/assensing) or improve your face skills as they'll be relatively cheap to improve.  EDIT: As I of course gloss over the very thing you brought up preventing you from masking force 6 spells, haha! Anyway, you still get to cast your increase attribute at force 5 which is good enough to boost it to aug. max, increase reflexes at force 5 which is 2 extra dice and 5 bonus initiative (putting you at what, 15+3d6?) and still have a good detect enemies spell up."

Shadowrun,37p40l,WhatWhatHunchHunch,6,Fri May 29 10:22:46 2015 UTC,"I don't care much about stats for NPCs. If the PCs fight them or use skills against them I base the skills on what is reasonable for said NPC.  To make up a NPCs personality it depends on how often I think the PCs will interract with them.  Lets pick someone they'll only meet a few times or even once (but matters in the story, such as someone they need info from).  Step 1.  I use whatever I come to think of (this often means a stereotype, but not always) ex. An old hobo.  Step 2.  I decide characters gender, either depending on what fits or I use what I haven't used for a while (I am pre-dispositioned to playing males so this is a good way to remember to throw females into the mix.) Ex old lady hobo.  Step 3  I think of what the character is about, nothing major, just if they are dedicated to their job or something. ex. Old lady hobo looking for her next meal.  Step 4  Add some little quirk. This can be as stereotypical or non-stereotypical as youd like. Stutter, lisp, no teeth, scars, repeats themselves etc. Ex. Old toothless lady hobo looking for her next meal.  Could also be: Old male hobo, who picks bugs out of his beard and wants to feel like he matters.  This can take between a few minutes and a few seconds depending on how used you are to it. If you are stressed for time, think up the quirk and dedication during the conversation.  Then I don't worry much about stats. But lets say the PC's use social skills. Odds are the hobo will have a bit of CON skill (maybe 3. Decent willpower (4 or 5) and body (3-5) to be able to survive and low charisma (1-2). And be lacking in most other things that matter.  In attributes I give the average human 2 in attributes they don't use much and 3 in attributes they use every now and again. ex. Wageslave str 2, charisma 3, logic 3 or 4."

For stats, I do something similar, though for a truly random NPC, I'll roll 2d6 for their stats and average the result, rounding towards 3.  If they're only mooks, I only make up the stats I need as I need them, and I don't even write them down.  For returning characters, I generally make notes of the stats as I go, but it's not the end of the world if I forget.

Shadowrun,37p5bh,kloked1work,2,Fri May 29 09:09:24 2015 UTC,"So, I'm thinking of setting this in Hong Kong rather than Seattle, but the idea is this: The players are near-prime Runners performing a very, very dangerous job for a Johnson known to them as ""Mr. Nobody"". I'm yet to decide what this job is, but Mr. Nobody sends a personal escort along, a very talented individual that's probably either a rigger or a decker, depending on what the team lacks at the time. What they don't realize is that Mr. Nobody is actually working for the corporation they're running against - he's doing it to capture them to keep them off that company's tail, seeing as they're some of the most dangerous runners around. As a result, the job goes south, the ""escort"" turns them over to the corp forces, and they go down fighting.  They're captured and imprisoned (not sure if there are actually any Hong Kong prisons, need to reread Runner Havens tonight), and plan a breakout. The breakout either goes as planned or sparks a riot, either one allowing them to escape, and they're forced back into street-level running, under new names and maybe even new faces.  Their task from there is to build their guanxi, get cred, make nuyen, and ultimately complete that one last job - and maybe kill Mr. Nobody along the way.  This is basically just a starting point that leads to an end, not a full outline. What do you think?"
Shadowrun,37p5bh,Joe_Kehr,2,Fri May 29 09:17:23 2015 UTC,"I do not really like the ""PCs get captured"" idea in general (in any system, that is). Of course, this is a classic trope in books and movies, but it is a problem in RPGs. This is because it is a forced outcome, and thus, every action of the players are irrelevant. This is not the point of an RPG. Just think of computer games in which you enter an area, a cut scence starts, and you are knocked unconscious (Far Cry 3, I am locking at you).  That's just annoying.  Maybe take a different perspective: What you described is Mr. Nobody's plan. You plan the set up, not the outcome. Of course, Mr. Nobody has aces up his sleeve but if the runners are smart enough they might smell the traps or are sufficiently prepared. Just let Mr. Nobody have a Plan B and C. They are surrounded by corp forces who try to stun them (Plan A). But Mr. Nobody knows that they might escape. So he laid out an obvious escape route which ends in the runner equivalent of a mouse trap (Plan B). But wait there is more! Of course, the runner's might smell this trap, too. So, they are lured into the safe haven of a contact if they made the escape. Of course, the contact was bought by Mr. Nobody... you get the picture.  Importantly, give them a fair chance. Chekov's gun. You don't say ""Suddenly, out of nowhere, troll guards in riot armor and combat mages appear. Roll for initiative."" You give them some hint. ""You enter what appears to be a loading area. The person responsible for the arrangement of the containers, however, seems to be rather incompetent, since they aren't arranged in an orderly fashion..."" Of course, the enemies are hiding in these containers. If the players misinterpret the signs, then it's their fault. Afterwards you might point out the signs and show that the players had, indeed, a chance. Another example: It is not ""The coffee was poisoned. You lose consciousness."" it is ""You don't feel particularly happy about the coffee. Judging from the smell it appears that Gladys has an new kitchen help with no concept of good coffee. Ah well, everything was better in the good ol' days...""  To me, the main point of the whole scenario is the ""From heros to zeros"" idea. This can be achieved even when they escape capture or only some of them are imprisoned. While they are busy evading traps, Mr. Nobody is ruining their lifes and destroying resources. Contacts become traitors, assests are seized, safehouses explode. The should get the chance to safe some things but it should be hard, because they might risk getting captured. In fact, endangering one of their assets might serve as another trapd laid out by Mr. Nobody.  As for the prison escape: I ran a prison escape scenario some time ago and the ""creative"" plan of people I asked for advice always was ""prison riot"". It's a dystopian future. The threshold for just gassing the whole facility, tasing rioters or even shooting them, is low. There is constant surveillance with video and microphones. You cannot easily incite a riot or even plan under these conditions. It's hard enough to escape a medieval fantasy prison, it's harder to escape a cyberpunk prison. You explained that the runners are important assets and because of that not just blown to pieces or crashed into the sea. Accordingly, they won't be put in an overcrowded, underfunded, Third-World prison. However, they might be able to activate a contact or use some tricks in order to be put just there...  Plan the prison with flaws. Maybe terrorists tried to free some guys earlier and the prison is still damaged (best thing would be to mention this in form of a newscast at the beginning of the run. Again, Checkov's Gun.). As a consequence, security is still not perfect, heavy machinery messes with the electronic, walls are brittle, the prison can be overflooded, etc."
Shadowrun,37p5bh,kloked1work,1 point,Fri May 29 13:25:33 2015 UTC,"This is MASSIVELY helpful information, and I am most definitely taking notes here. Thanks, chummer!"
Shadowrun,37p5bh,kloked1work,2,Fri May 29 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"Its a sound premise. Several things I consider is how much time/money these people are worth to remove from the equation.  Another thing to consider is how much Mr Nobody knows about the team.  If knows enough to know their strengths and weaknesses then he should be able to be sure whatever he sets them against is in his favor.  Since we're not playing Breaking Bad here and rooting for the bad guy (or badder guy in the case of Mr Nobody) there needs to be a way out for the team.  Stripping them of all their gear is surprisingly easy to do, have Mr Nobody request they go to a locale unarmed. Sure they will hide some surprises but they will be off their game and then overwhelming force can be used.  I did something similar to one of my teams.  They did a few screwups and got Interpol on their trail.  While they were off doing a run I had their homes raided. Now scared they went to ground and since they no longer had their homes/garages they became more street level.  Remember how easy it is to off a team in the game based on available resources and always give them an out.  Honestly if I were to just decide to off a team I'd have a Johnson hire them for a mission out of country, book them on a private flight, then have the flight take a nose dive into the ocean.  Perhaps a boat nearby with goons on it to be sure.  The killing is easy, giving the team a chance to be heroic is the tough part."
Shadowrun,37p5bh,kloked1work,1 point,Fri May 29 09:39:30 2015 UTC,I guess one caveat would be is why would the corp capture them? Are they needed alive at some other time?  If they are that much of a pain to them why bother with the capture and just grease them instead?
Shadowrun,37p5bh,kloked1work,1 point,Fri May 29 09:42:31 2015 UTC,"Simply put, they're worth more alive - at the start of the story, they're on retainer with Ares, considered high-value individuals. The corporation that captures them knows this, and the idea is that they're in prison because Mr. Nobody is holding them ransom - he knows he can get money out of Ares for their return, but they escape while the deal is being negotiated. Mr. Nobody would have to pay out the nose to get Ares off their tail if they were killed.  I could change it from them going into custody gunning to them getting away, and Mr. Nobody requesting they come to their meeting point unarmed, then swarming them with corpsec armed with tasers and stun rods till they go down."
Shadowrun,37p5bh,CitizenJoseph,1 point,Fri May 29 10:00:23 2015 UTC,"OK so they are needed alive.  Since they are important cargo for him there are a few things to consider. Does he want to or need to meet them personally?  Do they already know him?  What does he know about their abilities? What are his resources like?  How much legwork on them has he done?  There are several ways to capture them, and depending on their reaction to things and what he knows of them will determine his preferred course.  If he has full access to a facility he can set up an ambush with goons, gas, magic etc.  Sending goons to taser them to unconsciousness may be a good idea but they will probably fight back more lethally and have a chance to escape if a few dice roll their way.  Additionally they may be in a bad way once they are under control. If you need them in good shape gassing them is sure fire if he has access to that kinda thing a place to do it. Downsides there are gas masks (if they have them) and oxygenate spells.  Have a mage nuke them with a stun ball is another way to go unless they have magical defense.  One way I was thinking was drugging them. Whats good here is they can be take unawares.  Have them meet Mr Nobody at a bar and offer to buy them drinks while hes offering them a ""job"". Pay the bar keep (or have one of his already hire goons to play barkeep) slip them a mickey.  This may take care of the natural suspicion that comes with the ""come unarmed"" statement. If its a bar with metal detectors/chem sniffers and the like in its normal security this part will be done for Mr Nobody without him even having to say it.  The only thing to be worried about is how savvy the team is. Do they test every drink ever offered to them? Do they always request them in unopened bottles? Does the mage always read their employers aura?  Will the team do legwork before the meet to check the location/person?  If they are sloppy its in your favor, if not its going to be some hard work to take them."

That's not to say you can't do that in Shadowrun, it's just that you probably won't live too long if you do.  Along these lines: the importance of contacts and how they play into your game."

Or poking some kind of monster bear.  I'd say it's different from D&D in that there's planning and preparation like a heist movie, but I wouldn't say that's unique to Shadowrun so much as it is to things that aren't D&D inspired. A lot of modern games, where you're not out exploring new locations and wandering like you are in D&D, have a focus on who your social web is. Although it's important to note that the original WoD was inspired by Shadowrun, so perhaps it's not a coincidence that both rely so much on Contacts."

There are explicit rules against attacking twice in the same initiative pass, however there is an allowance for multi-attacks.

The Contact trigger is insanely broken and shurikens with damage on them is about the worst way to use it.  Buff spells to samurai, takedown spells on gun grips/back of neck via stealth or tinydrones, stealth guy smearing some salve on his eyes to suddenly get Detect Enemies, having the whole team able to toss glass balls to get an illusion of other shadowrunners moving in through an explosive breach in the wall wherever they tossed it, or ghouls, or whatever, so you don't need the mage to make the Perception check to know the group is rumbled in order to put down an illusion.  Three rubber bands with Combat Sense, Deflection, and Armour in them on the street sam's katana hilt is cash money.

Only the last few points are actually talking about alchemy vs aspected magician vs full magician.  Alchemy is the only way in the game to cast a spell(s) as part of another action.  Stun heals per the hour and most of the things you should be using as Preps are low-force, and the key things you will use reagents for (finally, a use for mage nuyen).  If you are good at anticipating what you need, and are willing to act through others, Alchemy will probably be more useful than Spellcasting.  If you lack the ability to pre-think your requirements, it's the other way around.  But really, the ability to cast 3 buff spells on the street sam hours before the fight, have them activate by themselves in the SS's first IP* and then not have to sustain them, alone, is worth taking and using Alchemy.  EDIT:  I like that you say 'in fact' and then link to a post by you saying it sucks.  Not even like, a different person."

Shadowrun,37nxlx,Bamce,1 point,Sat May 30 13:45:58 2015 UTC,"Oh wait, I found it.   A Simple Action is one step more complicated than a Free Action and requires more concentration to attempt. During his Action Phase, a character may take two Simple Actions, though only one can be an attack action. A character may also take a Free Action with the two Simple Actions. pp164   There's no rules for attacking multiple opponents with a single-target spell, and no 'multiple spells' action that I can find.  And yes, I was referring to Reckless Spellcasting.  I thought there was something in the splat with maneuvers.. riposte?  That let you melee attack as a simple action under some circumstance also.  But regardless, I am deeply unsatisfied with that rules text.  Is Control Thoughts an 'attack action'?  A Physical illusion?  Disarming someone?  Palming a live grenade into their pocket?  Ordering a spirit to attack?  Distracting you so someone can hit you more easily?  Ugh.  Poorly written rules text, so delightful."

The magician can only choose from this set of spells.   Casting Multiple Spells: Some magicians have the mental discipline to weave multiple threads of mana into various spells at once. You can attempt to cast multiple spells simultaneously in the same action, even at different targets. To do this, you have to split your Spellcasting + Magic dice pool between the spells you want to cast (see Step 4), with a minimum of 1 die per spell. Since the modifiers per spell may be different, they are applied after you split the dice pool. The number of spells you can cast simultaneously is limited to  our Magic attribute.   Pg 281  Ripost and counter strike are defense test modifiers, Interrupt actions. Which are neither simple, nor free, nor complex.  It would take some interpretation of situation. I would rule that any thing you do to another person that is not voluntary is an attack action. Thus control thoughts, a very much attack action.  However if you were say throwing a fireball, and making yourself invis that would be one attack action. I would allow you to cast both at full dice pool if you used reckless casting."

This means that if you were dual-wielding firearms you could spend a simple action to take aim, a simple action to fire, and a free action for multiple attacks. If you were using a melee weapon (either alone or with a firearm) you'd spend a complex action to attack with it and a free action to perform multiple attacks, whether with an accompanying firearm or melee weapon or not."

At the same time you'd probably give a bonus to defending from intimidation.  I wouldn't penalize knowledge skills, if you know something you know something, but I might insist from time to time that the AI player have at least a point in certain knowledge before assuming he even understands it. Stuff like Knowledge: Body Language or Knowledge: Metahuman sexuality.  As an aside, You'd think most AI would have a lack of understanding of things like property rights or sanctity of life.

For example an AI wouldn't be very good with a gun in meat space because it has all this manual aiming and things like physics, atmosphere, bullet trajectories, etc. to contend with.  Maybe after they got used to it the GM would ease off, but a -3 or -4 penalty for the first few gun fights would make sense, with a -1 after becoming ""seasoned"".  But a change of frames would likely impose the penalties fresh again because they have to get used to how new servos work.  They'd be even LESS competent with anything social (as /u/TaeoG/ mentioned), and you might even go so far as to impose a -5 penalty on initial awkward Etiquette (think SHODAN talking down to the meat puppets with disdain), Con (what is deception?  What is...  Sarcasm?), and Negotiation tests.

Shadowrun,37ls0l,Feynt,2,Thu May 28 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"To the contrary, physics is nothing but mathematical equations, which computers are very good at quickly crunching. If anything, AI's, with the proper knowledge and hardware, might be even better at firing a weapon than the average Metahuman, since we are limited to experience with wind conditions, recoil, aiming, distance to target, etc., but they can simply pull up the appropriate equation(s) and find the perfect trajectory given the correct information on the afore mentioned problems.  Perhaps initial fire fights would be to strictly collect data on recoil, wind factors, etc., which could then be used further down the road to improve the appropriate firearms skill(s). I assume it would depend on the AI itself, and how exposed it is to the physics of meatspace. In game terms, as a GM, I wouldn't necessarily unduly penalize an AI if it has taken the time to educate itself about physics.  Anyway, this is assuming an AI even has access to a firearm which it is able to shoot and aim.  Otherwise, I agree with your post!"
Shadowrun,37ls0l,Bercelak,2,Thu May 28 21:01:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, physics is largely math, but the math requires knowledge of all the variables.  Gravity is a constant, but without reading the specs for the gun you won't know the muzzle velocity of the bullet.  Likewise for an entity that existed without things like friction, wind, recoil, etc. it's a jarring experience that requires calibration before accuracy can be achieved.  A metahuman has the advantage of having grown up around most of those things, training with a gun gives them the rest.  The other thing to consider in the equation is the firing mount.  With metahumans the gun is hand held, and we've been using our hands since day one to grasp stuff.  With a drone shell, the gun may be in an external weapon mount, hand held (humanoid bipedal drones), or integral to the drone itself.  Regardless, drone to drone, the handling of the weapon is different from model to model (and modification to modification within the same model), so it's a new experience if the AI transfers between drones, even if they've shot a mounted assault rifle a hundred times on a roto-drone, while they're piloting a lynx.  The quality in question though is a negative, deliberately indicating that the coding of the AI was not meant to handle meat space, and either can't accept, won't accept, or is completely clueless to begin with about the nature of meat space.  Like I said, I'd allow some of the penalties to get lighter or non-existent with enough time (shooting a gun with a drone you inhabit often becomes old hat eventually), but some things will continue to remain a mystery (like social interactions.  What is love?  What is fear?  What is hate?  Lacking all these basic concepts would make them inept at negotiation, con, etc.)"
Shadowrun,37ls0l,Feynt,2,Thu May 28 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"I rather like the thought of an AI first inhabiting a Doberman on the roof of a building and proceeding to roll right off the edge, finally figuring out what gravity was all about."
Shadowrun,37ls0l,Forged_Fury,1 point,Thu May 28 16:44:18 2015 UTC,Things conveyed through body language (tapping your finger to express impatience) or expectations of physical space (you queue up in front of the door and wait your turn) would be weird concepts for an AI.

Shadowrun,37ls0l,Sebbychou,1 point,Thu May 28 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"Highlander was a documentary shot in real time.  Also, video game logic would probably make sense. Red barrels are always explosive. Wind and gravity never effect shots. Everyone can jump their height in distance. You never get tired from running, though you can only sprint for short bursts unless you rapidly toggle between sprint and run. Using the toilet heals you. Death just means you need to wait for the respawn timer.  That seems pretty legit to me. If I was an AI, I'd believe it."

If you're not looking to do tons of work astral side you might want to switch to MysAd for Enhanced Reflexes. Even with the karma cost for the points, 20 karma is cheaper than 200k nuyen.

Shadowrun,37me0b,Bamce,2,Thu May 28 21:27:12 2015 UTC,"I tend to run with a ""You're never going to level up"" view on Shadowrun, with the only real exception being initiations.  Betaware is so expensive. It works fine for the small stuff like a smuggling compartment for your monowhip(great because it's harder to find on scans) but anything really expensive like an Adrenaline Pump or Synaptics(especially if you want to simultaneously upgrade to L.3)  is going to be an upgrade you aren't going to reach until months into the weekly game, and that's if you're spending on nothing else and keeping a lower lifestyle.  YMMV if your gm leaves cyberdecks laying around."

Shadowrun,37me0b,rejakor,1 point,Fri May 29 06:46:56 2015 UTC,More story than mechanical.   Initiation is suppose to represent an important character realization. Not some mechanical power bump.   Also quickening
Shadowrun,37me0b,HaxDBHeader,1 point,Fri May 29 09:07:57 2015 UTC,"Quickening is just broken.  Any means of adding infinity buffs is broken.  You're 'supposed' to stop it by adding mana barriers etc, but then you've got someone paying permanent XP for a non-permanent benefit, which is bad.  I just don't have it in the game.  If I had to have it, i'd limit it to spells of force = magic/2 (round down), and you would Quicken them by spending (not burning) a point of Edge.  And you can't break the limit on those spells, and they light you up on the astral like normal etc.  Some mages are going to just initiate as fast as they can and have less stats or other abilities, some mages are going to want to be more rounded.  I don't think it's fair to say that 'during your entire backstory, you avoided initiating'.  And also, initiation is not an 'important character realization', it's an 'important change'.  You can fluff it in any way that makes sense with the mechanics, but basically, you're a bit more Astral and a bit less Physical is what it's supposed to be, and if you look past all the bad writing and waffling that's still what they are trying to describe it as."
Shadowrun,37me0b,Bamce,0,Fri May 29 13:38:32 2015 UTC,"I have a standard core implant set for any cyber-mage I put together: Cyber-eyes with many mods to improve ability to get LOS for spells Trauma Damper to reduce drain damage. This is huge for a spellcaster since it is essentially a free hit on the drain test        I then fill out any other implants based upon what I want to be able to do. A popular one is Skillwires 3 to cut down on the need for spending karma on any mundane skills that aren't part of my core concept. For instance, your above concept might use skill points/karma to buy survival but could skillwire for driving. As a mage you will often find yourself with excess money (buy skillsofts) and in need of karma (don't waste it on rarely used skills)      I generally try to stick to 1 point of implants but have occasionally gone up to 2 points. It depends heavily upon the concept. Your charisma-based shamanic magic won't be helped by Tailored Pheremones, etc so anything else you would want to pick would be heavily sensitive to the details of your concept."

But it's a good way to introduce it. As my player came to the conclusion he was just crazy. Which is not inaccurate.  Stolen Souls takes place in April of 2076 has more details on CFD, but doesn't have any runs in it. Though it has plenty of run ideas. Like it's possible for the runners to meet and be hired by Butch, she's a female ork street doc, to find a cure for CFD.  Lockdown takes place in June of 2076 and pretty much has all the bad stuff. It on top of being a Boston Sourcebook is also a campaign book just dedicated to CFD.  Honestly, I might recommend cutting to the chase and jump straight into Lockdown. But that depends if you really want to build up CFD as a large and mysterious threat. If you want the build up, going in order is the way to go."

At the very least the last bits before the game information chapter are relevant to CFD (and moving as well).  Storm front starts CFD somewhere around 2072, and kinda solidifies it up to 2074.  after that splintered state kinda takes over in 2075, and then stolen souls is the big info dump in 2076.  Lockdown is june 2076 and is pretty much the most recent information on CFD (although the Boston variant is a variant, I believe they describe as souped up so it will affect a dragon).  I really recommend reading the storm front bit on Fastjack, it's a great jump off point for CFD.  after that I feel like Stolen Souls has how it affects the world, and Lockdown has what it's like when it goes REALLY wrong.    All in all thought, CFD is still a big vague thing in canon.  Nothing really set in stone, so you can steer it however you want it to go.  Hope this helps!"
