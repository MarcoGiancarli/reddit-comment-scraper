GamePhysics,3e2cjr,biasio95,32,Tue Jul 21 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"Really sad that the sequel won't have any gunplay in it. I can understand the reasoning behind why... but I don't know if I entirely agree with it. For a game that's aiming to be more open and dynamic in the way the world is presented to the player, it seems like a ""one step forward, two steps back"" scenario."
GamePhysics,3e2cjr,mmiski,47,Tue Jul 21 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you, but people shouldn't be downvoting you for having a different opinion. Personally, I thought the gunplay was easily the worst part of the game, slowing down the feel of movement that the rest of the game did so well."
GamePhysics,3e2cjr,niktay,29,Tue Jul 21 15:52:40 2015 UTC,"It definitely slowed it down, but it was must an option. You could just not do it if you didn't like it.  It's like a game like Hitman not allowing you to kill civilians because killing all in a map would be tedious and pointless. Sure, but what if I want to anyways?"
GamePhysics,3e2cjr,Cyntheon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:32 2015 UTC,"Some levels towards the end, like the server room, really made using guns almost necessary though. While you could technically do it without guns, it was really tedious if you chose that route."
GamePhysics,3e2cjr,ShazbotSimulator2012,18,Tue Jul 21 19:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah for the record I'm not asking for the ability to collect guns and carry it around throughout an entire level or anything. It's clearly not a game that's focused around gunplay (that's what Battlefield is for). But personally I found it fun to disarm someone, use their own gun on them, then use it on a buddy of his, and then throw it away as I parkour my ass to the next objective. It felt very Matrix-y and fun.  I'm afraid that the sequel will be missing some of that variety and finesse with the combat system. I'm afraid that combat will dumbed down into melee button mashing and nothing more. It's fine if some people like that, but why limit the gameplay and remove options? Especially when there's all this talk of having more pathways and solutions in some type of open world system."
GamePhysics,3e2cjr,mmiski,3,Tue Jul 21 16:34:44 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed the takedown and disabling maneuvers though. I hope they at least stay
GamePhysics,3e2cjr,davi00a1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Maybe they could have kept it around, but added in some sort of punishing mechanic for relying on them. I agree with you, just think it would be nice to still have them around as a crutch for people who can't evade or melee well"
GamePhysics,3e2cjr,LurikeenCosantoir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:16 2015 UTC,"removing gunplay allows the developers to emphasize the rest of the gameplay mechanics. people will say they didn't like the gunplay in the original because it was clunky and unfun but the biggest reason gunplay didn't work was because it was thematically inconsistent with the atmosphere of the game. 90% of the game, your goal is to run as fast as you can and use your wit to bypass obstacles in your path. then, randomly, the other 10% you're meant to stand your ground and go full rambo. not only was this contrast incredibly jarring and unexpected but it was also not conveyed well to the player. gunplay, as a result, felt like it was in the way of the game rather than an addition to it"

Did the E2 unbreak itself at all? I would love to even have that E2, even to just see how it works. Trying to learn it, but it's been tough because the one friend that usually taught me things has moved on to C++ and C# coding and has thus forgotten much of his Lua and E2 memory, sadly. It's also been hard to find E2s since I usually build only on my private server and many other servers don't have a lot of my favorite tools and models.

GamePhysics,3dhisr,addisonxb,76,Thu Jul 16 12:36:38 2015 UTC,"Sleeping Dogs is one of my all time favorite games. It hasn't aged as well as it could have, but they released a remastered version last October called Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition that helps with that.  All around it's a good game, but it's real strength is that it has a large cast of unique and diverse characters in a really amazing setting and story. I think the characters in Sleeping Dogs have the most personality of any video game in recent memory.   There's also a lot of beating shit up and driving fast cars, which is nice."
GamePhysics,3dhisr,UndersizedAlpaca,8,Thu Jul 16 13:13:24 2015 UTC,"It's also an open love letter to '80s Hong Kong action cinema, and they absolutely nailed every single aspect of that, from the John Woo slo-mo gunplay to the Jackie Chan-like use of the environment and parkour, to many other martial arts star nods (they even included Bruce Lee's trademark front leg hook, as well as his jumpsuit from Game of Death) and an Infernal Affairs-inspired plot for good measure.

GamePhysics,3ddvmn,InexorableToast,86,Wed Jul 15 15:56:30 2015 UTC,Well the water has a bit of a bounce effect when boats fall into it (like from a wave) so I think it just has some really weird interaction when amphibious vehicles fall into water since there is really no reason for them to be doing so (since they don't nearly have to speed to get airborne off of a wave)

But I've said before and will say again, he operative word for describing ME2 was ""overcorrection"". The inventory system in ME1 sucked, but that doesn't mean I wanted to have such a limited selection of guns and no choices in armor. The mako's controls were bad but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable (and the firewalker DLC showed that they knew how to fix the controls, too, so it's not like it was that).  I could go on for ages, but you get the idea.  Still haven't played ME3.

This is going from vague memory. ""Overcorrection"" is the perfect description to me. The games got smoother and more focused I guess, but I think they sacrificed some of the intelligence by doing so. I liked the Mako too, but I guess it would have made the new planet designs impossible, or at least jarring to have both beautiful, detailed planets and generic procedurally generated ones... or would it, I dunno. It's been ages since I've played either though, and despite my gripes about the changes made, the 2nd game still blew me away as much as the first did. My first time fighting one of those flying machine dealies in the 2nd game was so intense."

Sort of was thinking when I play it that I might just play up until the end, and then imagine the ending instead. From what I've heard it should give roughly the same sense of catharsis... But maybe people exaggerated and it's fine.  And of course, by no means was ME2 a bad game. I'd hazard to say that it was still better than the first one, overcorrection aside. I think the real problem was when they tried applying those same fixes to Dragon Age. Going back and playing DA: O after playing DA2 just makes you feel bad for the series."

GamePhysics,3d7uei,BlueAndContrary,64,Tue Jul 14 12:28:45 2015 UTC,I'd guess the fighting system fixes positioning slightly when you hit enemies so the animations don't look like crap and everything stays nice and fluid.  Batman seemed stuck but for some reason the attacks still triggered and the fixes were somewhat less subtle?
GamePhysics,3d7uei,Tarmen,25,Tue Jul 14 13:08:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds right, for anyone unfamiliar with the batman arkham series. you can tilt the movement stick in any direction when directing an attack and provided there isn't any terrain (such as a car or trashcan) in the way then batman should clear the distance between him and the assumed target in one long floaty animation regardless of the range between them.  It works pretty well, if you're aiming the stick towards a target that would resist your attack (and break your combo) and someone else is close to them then it will ignore the bad target and hit the good one."

GamePhysics,3d7uei,BlueAndContrary,2,Tue Jul 14 14:53:05 2015 UTC,"the fight system shown here is a lot like the vats system from Fallout 3. Batman can choose enemies in slowed down time to instantly takedown if his ""fear"" metre is full.  This system is used to take out enemies with guns who are too peskie to silently take down individually. What happened here though is the player dropped down to these armed goons and got stuck on top of the autoturret whilst doing the quick multitakedown move. Instead of batman jumping from goon to goon, the goons were positioned to batman because he wasn't able to move through the geometry of the turret."

GamePhysics,3d5h0i,DickmanComedy,3,Tue Jul 14 07:29:15 2015 UTC,This made me laugh the hardest I have in a while.

GamePhysics,3d5h0i,Infernal_Dalek,2,Tue Jul 14 03:29:05 2015 UTC,I must go.  My people need E.

GamePhysics,3d5h0i,ATadVillainy,0,Sun Jul 19 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"I seriously thought this game was from about 2002 before I read the title, those graphics are horrendous for a 2015 game..."
GamePhysics,3d5h0i,Maxtsi,12,Tue Jul 14 04:31:12 2015 UTC,The WWE games are seriously cheap budget titles pretending to be AAA because of the license. They've never had great gameplay and the customization and presentation has gotten worse every instead of better. The menus in 2k15 are completely broken and have a terrible interface. It's rather shameful to be honest.
GamePhysics,3d5h0i,NotSafeForShop,2,Tue Jul 14 12:27:40 2015 UTC,"""They've never had great gameplay."""
GamePhysics,3d5h0i,Colorfag,-11,Tue Jul 14 17:16:06 2015 UTC,"If you use terms like ""AAA games"" you deserve to be ripped off."
GamePhysics,3d5h0i,Maxtsi,13,Tue Jul 14 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"It's a shorthand for ""full $60 release."" Relax."
GamePhysics,3d5h0i,NotSafeForShop,3,Tue Jul 14 13:47:28 2015 UTC,Or short for big budget
GamePhysics,3d5h0i,Maxtsi,-12,Tue Jul 14 15:22:04 2015 UTC,"No, it's a rating designed by gaming companies and then perpuated by gamers who think that made-up ratings will result in a higher quality of game."
GamePhysics,3d5h0i,NotSafeForShop,11,Tue Jul 14 13:50:11 2015 UTC,"You haven't been following the games industry for very long, have you?"
GamePhysics,3d5h0i,alexrmay91,-12,Tue Jul 14 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have actually. I just don't get sucked in by the marketing departments of big gaming companies like you clearly have."

GamePhysics,3d6znc,753509274761453,25,Tue Jul 14 00:36:15 2015 UTC,Driving into the map boundary was always my favorite thing to do in that game

GamePhysics,3d6znc,CohnJunningham,14,Tue Jul 14 06:31:10 2015 UTC,All I remember from the first game was this song
GamePhysics,3d6znc,NoblePineapples,7,Tue Jul 14 08:45:52 2015 UTC,"I don't remember if it was this game or the MX vs BMX game but where was a train track that ran through the map and everytime I played it, I made it my goal to jump onto the train and ride it around the map."
GamePhysics,3d6znc,Emperosabi,4,Tue Jul 14 13:09:09 2015 UTC,I think it was MX vs ATV Unleashed. I remember the freeride mode and when you hit that invisible wall you'd get sent flying across the map. Fun times indeed.
GamePhysics,3d6znc,MiNombreEsBread,3,Tue Jul 14 14:30:56 2015 UTC,"Oh jeez. I remember finding a glitch in that game where riding up some stairs and hitting a door at the right angle would send you flying into goddamn oblivion. I remember once it sent me so high up that I never came down, so I had to turn off the PS2."
GamePhysics,3d6znc,MX64,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:13:17 2015 UTC,This game also had a train you could ride.
