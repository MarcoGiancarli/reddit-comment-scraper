Lovecraft,3dzsc3,vhite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:25:09 2015 UTC,"Lovecraft's imagery, ideas, and general je ne sais quoi is notoriously difficult to translate to visual media, especially film. Things like the lingering dread, the appearance of the unknowable, mad narrators, and so on make filming a direct Lovecraft adaptation tricky.  That said, I would love to see something based off of the prose-poem Nyarlathotep. Shorter, simpler works like From Beyond or The Picture in the House or even The Outsider might work better though.  As an aside, I feel obligated to mention a couple of pre-Lovecraft weird fiction works that I would like to see on screen. Robert Chambers The Repairer of Reputations and In the Court of the Dragon (stories in the King in Yellow Cycle) and Algernon Blackwood's The Willows. These stories were a huge influence on Lovecraft, and contain many similar themes"
Lovecraft,3dzsc3,G-Riz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:24 2015 UTC,You might want to try The Festival. It's a good story and for the most part it would be rather friendly to your budget. Though you would probably have to tweak the ending a little too keep it that way.
Lovecraft,3dzsc3,burgundyblack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:46 2015 UTC,"The Music of Erich Zann, The Shadow Over Innsmouth, and The Case of Charles Dexter Ward would be good candidates. The level of ambiguity is relatively low, decreasing the amount of interpretative headache along the way, and each has enough substance to actually make a short movie."
Lovecraft,3dzsc3,SIRoldharry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:42 2015 UTC,"After watching Penny Dreadful, I'm convinced something like that series would be great for Lovecraft. The mythos is already cross over heavy, so with a little tweaking you could combine multiple works. Randolph Carter is a shoe in for a main ""lead"", ""assisted"" by Harley Warren and Professor Armitage. From there, you'd probably need to create a few characters whole cloth, notably some women, but it could easily turn into a macabre romp. Focus more on the human/cult aspect, sprinkling in magic, the deeps ones (Obed Marsh as a major villain would be fun), and things like the Dunwich Horror as the cast slowly finds out what is really at stake. They would of course be based out of Miskatonic University. I think it could work well, especially as the mythos is so rich in cross over potential as it is."

The award represents Lovecraft's contribution to the literary world, and in no way reflects his personal views on race. People still demanded it be changed because Lovecraft was a racist. People who have received the award. People who are definitely well-read.  Never underestimate the ability for an offended person to be completely unable to separate work from belief. To many people, even well read people, honoring a racist's work is the same as honoring racism.  But beyond that, the majority of the people likely to be offended at anything being named after Lovecraft or his work would not be well read.

Lovecraft,3d93ag,Swagceratopz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:56:49 2015 UTC,"I mean to be fair. I was always a fan of the band LostProphets, and while there music is still good, I refuse to listen to them anymore after their lead singer was convicted to 29 years of prison for 13 counts of sexual offences against children, including rape. I feel as though even though their art does not depict their own intent I cannot bring myself to support their older music.

Thinking back to The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (easily one of my favorites), Randolph Carter makes it to the moon as well as heads towards the center of universe (to the court of Azathoth) due to being tricked by Nyarlathotep.  Now Azathoth's domain is considered outside the normal Cosmos, being described as ""beyond angled space"" which reminds me of the Hound of Tindalos and the fact that they can travel through sharp angles. But humans come from curved space so guess would be that the Cosmos Azathoth resides in is somewhere far beyond both the physical and dream worlds."

Lovecraft,3cx6lc,sheriff_gingerbeard,3,Sat Jul 11 15:52:51 2015 UTC,"I think you might be missing the degree of Moore's work on this one, as Joe Linton and I discuss in the annotations. The idea that Lovecraft's fiction ""really happened"" is an old chestnut - even cliche - but the idea that Lovecraft's fiction is a fictionalized version of real events in the way Moore is portraying it here is decidedly uncommon. I agree he's relying on intertextuality a great deal, but that's because he's deconstructing a lot fLovecraft's stories and building up a ""new"" mythology. For Mythos fans, it's a treat; for people just reading the surface story and not getting any of the references, I agree that it's a bit lackluster so far.  That said, I don't think you're giving enough credit to Jacen Burrows - this might well be him at the top of his game in these issues. I really love the attention to detail in the setting, the clothing, all the little details of orientation and period furnishings and the like. It's extraordinarily well done, especially compared to a lot of mainstream comics."
Lovecraft,3cx6lc,AncientHistory,2,Sat Jul 11 16:38:12 2015 UTC,"I definitely disagree about the degree. Namely:   the idea that Lovecraft's fiction is a fictionalized version of real events in the way Moore is portraying it here is decidedly uncommon.   I absolutely disagree with this. All he's doing is saying the referent is the Kabbalah or Yazid instead of the Necronomicon or al-Hazred. I can think of several books, even recently, that use the same idea: The Strange Adventures of H.P. Lovecraft, Lovecraft, and Five Ghosts are just three offhand examples from the same medium. There are many, many more. The idea is tired. And really, the impulse is even a bit of a rehash of the principle behind one of Moore's own works, Promethea.  And really, I think you give him too much credit here:   I agree he's relying on intertextuality a great deal, but that's because he's deconstructing a lot fLovecraft's stories and building up a ""new"" mythology.   All he's doing is drawing the referents to extant mythology, and it's not adding any layers to the text. It's just copying the layers from all of Lovecraft's works and all works on Lovecraft, including the ones I mentioned, and altering it so Moore can flex his research/knowledge muscles. I don't see anything he's done that's truly working as an engaging reflection of Lovecraft's work, or as an engaging text on its own, that others haven't done before. I would say I'm a pretty huge Mythos fan (hell, it's a pretty big part of my life now), but I find the story more disappointing because of it. It's allowing me to see how much of this book is just typical Moore schtick rather than reminiscent of his more interesting works.  I will admit that I did not give Burrows a fair shake, but I want to emphasize that I'm not so much critiquing his work as much as the way he and Moore have chosen to approach it. That's as much, if not more so, Moore's fault, because we all know how meticulously he outlines panels at the structural and detailed level. Next time, I will be sure to include some more work with Burrows' work within the panels, although a lot of that can be left to your annotations for significant detail, given the nature of the annotation model."
Lovecraft,3cx6lc,AncientHistory,3,Sat Jul 11 16:47:23 2015 UTC,"All he's doing is drawing the referents to extant mythology, and it's not adding any layers to the text. It's just copying the layers from all of Lovecraft's works and all works on Lovecraft, including the ones I mentioned, and altering it so Moore can flex his research/knowledge muscles.    We're going to have to disagree. Look at what he's setting up with the American coven, drawing together elements of Lovecraft's fiction in a way that Lovecraft did not do. Remember that HPL wasn't looking to build anything like a consistent mythology; he doesn't draw these connections in his own stories - maybe never even thought about doing so - and had very limited knowledge of the occult; so Moore is taking the opportunity to tie together the looser elements of Lovecraft's mythos and try to integrate them together with elements of real occult practice and history. Hell, look at how he tied the Necronomicon into ""Cool Air"" - that's no-prize worthy material, at least.  Like I said, the surface events aren't terribly engaging yet - but that's because Moore is doing a lot of exposition, introducing readers gradually to this layers-of-the-onion expose on the ""real"" Mythos-behind-the-Mythos. It's incredibly wonkish, and too early to say if it'll pay off in the end, but I have a bit of faith. Whatever your beef with how Moore does things, the man does have a fair bit of experience at deconstructing and reconstructing genre fiction.  /edited to be less of a prat about it; we may disagree on our takeaway from this issue, but it's still subjective and I don't want to say that your opinion is wrong - only that I think there's more merit to what Moore has done here than you have yet found in it."
Lovecraft,3cx6lc,AncientHistory,3,Sat Jul 11 17:00:46 2015 UTC,"All fair points. It seems to me like we're seeing the same thing, but one of us is more optimistic about the potential than the other. And no worries about being a prat; the internet is hard to communicate tone on—I usually muck it up—and I've seen enough of your posts to know you're pretty even-handed.  My issue is that I've found Moore's work to either be engaging and intelligently* deconstructive, or indulgent and masturbatory. Thus far, Providence feels like the latter, telling us over and over again how deep it is and how amazing it will be, but not giving much justification for us to believe it (disclaimer here to note, of course, that this is just my opinion). I just don't like Moore enough to give him such a massive benefit of the doubt.   I don't doubt the possibility that after all 12 issues are released, and I read them all at once, that I might find the work he's doing to be insightful and well-built. In the current release model, though, I think whether Providence works for you or not is largely predicated on your feelings toward Moore, and that says a lot to me about the uncertain quality of the stories released so far."

Lovecraft,3cmonh,androidbitcoin,3,Thu Jul 9 02:33:52 2015 UTC,"If you are asking about copyright in the United States, then /u/MylesMDT's post is what you would need (though if you are talking about copyright law in other countries, it depends, with Life+50 and Life+70 countries already seeing the works lapse into their public domain).   However, if you are talking about actual trademark, there are a few specific instances - Chaosium's ""Call of Cthuhlu"" line being a good example - where Cthulhu is part of a companies trademark. You can search via the USPTO to see the live trademarks. A recent filing by Lovecraft Holdings LLC is for the use of CTHULHU as a trademark on clothing, but I am unsure how well that will hold in that there are lots of clothes with the word ""cthulhu"" on them, so it might come down to specific font design, etc. As for the cephalopod-headed great old one as an image icon, I do not see any listings for trademark, though it is possible that someone has it described without the use of the actual word ""Cthulhu"", which could make it harder to search.  Note: Left out the USPTO would be governing over trademarks in the US, other countries might vary."

You have to search the market.  That said, it's pretty well known that Chaosium uses that trademark for RPGs, for example.  (And I bet they are registered, so a search would turn them up, but I'm using them as an easiest-possible example.)  But if you're selling oil drill bits or dog food(*) or genetically-modified roses that are resistant to sea spray, chances are (and yeah, this is a matter of chance) nobody else is selling Cthulhu-brand those-things yet.

Lovecraft,3c7gp7,AncientHistory,5,Sun Jul 5 17:00:37 2015 UTC,Any chance of you sharing more about the letters?
Lovecraft,3c7gp7,AncientHistory,6,Sun Jul 5 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"Sure. These letters are from the outrageously priced booklet Arthur C. Clarke & Lord Dunsany: A Correspondence (1998), edited and assembled by Keith Allen Daniels:   Kings College, Strand, W.C.1 16 March 1948  Dear Lord Dunsany,  I think that the enclosed magazine, which I have just received fromt he States, may interest you a good deal. (Arkham House, I notice, is publishing ""The Fourth Book of Jorkens"".)  ""The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath"" made a considerable impression on me when I first read it some time ago. Have you ever come across any of Lovecraft's work before? As you will see from the editorial note, he was strongly influenced by your earlier writings. His output was very large, and somewhat uneven, but his best stories were masterpieces in their genre. Although they only appeared in magazine form during his life many have now been reprinted in anthologies and collections.  Perhaps you will let me have the magazine back eventually, at your convenience.  My examinations are now looming very large on the horizon, so I am retiring to the country for a month's steady reading.  Very sincerely yours, Arthur C. Clarke   And:   Dunsany Castle, Co. Meath March 20, 1948  Dear Mr. Clarke,  Thank you very much for the Arkham Sampler. I see Lovecraft borrowed my style, and I don't grudge it to him. Indeed, I am glad to be able to read his tales. The Necronomicon reminds me of a brief scene I once sent to a paper called Rhythm, or The Blue Review (I forget which), that was edited by Middleton Murry, which I called The Fifth Act of the Thlobbon of Sapphanal. Middleton Murray printed it, but I don't think he quite made head or tail of it. That was a very long time ago. I will send the magazine back to you shortly. Perhaps when your examination is successfully over & when we are in England, as we shall be from the beginning of April, you might care to come & see us at our small house, Dunstall Priory, Shoreham near Sevenoaks, Kent. It is only 20 miles by electric train from Victoria; & to anyone who contemplates the journeys that you contemplate it is not far, unless you should mistake, as many do, our little Shoreham for the larger on on the sea, in which case the journey to reach us is of a more interplanetary nature.  Yours sincerely Dunsany   The issue of Rhythm in which ""The Thlobbon of Sappanal--Act VII"" and is available online: Link  Some years later, in 1952, Lord Dunsany sent a letter to August Derleth:   Dunstall Priory Shoreham Nr Sevenoaks March 28, 1952  Dear Mr. Derleth  I have been told of an article which I never saw in print, written about my work by the late H. P. Lovecraft, in a book published by you called Marginalia. It would be very kind of you if you would give me a copy of this book because I cannot get one here, & have an odd interest in Lovecraft’s work because in the few tales of his I have read I found that he was writing in my style, entirely originally & without in any way borrowing from me, & yet with my style & largely my material. It would much interest me to see the book if you would be so kind as to send me a copy.  Yours sincerely, Dunsany   The essay in Marginalia was ""Lord Dunsany and his Work"", which also appeared as a foreword in the 1976 edition of Lord Dunsany's Tales of Three Hemispheres."
Lovecraft,3c7gp7,AncientHistory,3,Sun Jul 5 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, so he was definitely aware of Lovecraft, enough to have read most of his works.  I wonder if the sense of utter insignificance written in Childhood's End were influenced, then?"
Lovecraft,3c7gp7,AncientHistory,3,Sun Jul 5 21:00:06 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. The thing is, in Lovecraft, the greater realities of the universe are utterly indifferent to humanity; Azathoth doesn't care if humans superevolve or if beetles superevolve. The Overmind, on the other hand, takes a deliberate interest in beings that are going to evolve to be part of it's self.  On another level, I can totally see how Arthur C. Clarke was an influence on Jack Kirby."
Lovecraft,3c7gp7,gonzohistory,3,Sun Jul 5 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think humans would ever survive to become anything important to a Lovecraftian universe, but if they could, who is to say the beings of Lovecraft wouldn't take an interest?   Azathoth resembles the Overmind in capacity, but I think Nyarlathotep is a better analogy. Nyar seemed interested in guiding humanity, and its affect on the Earth is not unlike the Overmind's, ultimately: the followers become sort of autistic to the world around them and humanity as we know it ceases to be.  I think the Overmind is indifferent to what evolves until it evolves, but the pattern is there: the loss of universal innocence, that inescapable change in humanity's understanding of the universe and its place in it. In Clarke's world humanity grows and flourishes in unexpected ways; in Lovecraft's world, humanity drowns in insignificance.  As far as intervening, that was all the Overlords doing. The Overlords seemed more interested in helping the races reach a certain point than the Overmind itself, probably to stop the universe from being destroyed by wildly out of control psychic gestalts, and out of some voyeuristic need to feel involved beyond their limited existence.   Jack Kirby   Yes, the Overmind closely resembles Galactus, and the Overlords the heralds. Uatu, too."

Lovecraft,3c7gp7,DiscoJer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:17:47 2015 UTC,"Well, the idea of ""space gods"" was pretty current in the 60s and 70s, surely? It's not like that's the only place where it appears.   Jason Colavito (IIRC) has argued that that whole thing owes its origin to Lovecraft, though, so in the end you may be right after all, just at several removes."

Lovecraft,3bxdoi,gonzohistory,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:43:21 2015 UTC,"It's just that the early Carter stories will seem a bit odd if your vision of Randolph Carter is that he's the Carter from the later ones. He sort of ... escalates throughout them. Similarly, the other stories listed -- ""Call,"" ""Shadow"" and ""Thing"" -- refer to concepts introduced in earlier stories, but there's no intended continuity, really; Lovecraft is just expanding on or glancingly referring to ideas he introduced elsewhere."
Lovecraft,3bxdoi,kmallon12,2,Mon Jul 20 08:35:52 2015 UTC,"I've got Necronomicon myself. ""The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath"" was the only story that felt out of order. If you read it where AncientHistory has it listed, you'll be good. ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"" only has a very brief mention of Carter. What time you read that story won't make a difference. ""Out of the Aeons"" is not in Necronomicon. I have yet to read it myself, but from what I know about it, Carter's appearance will only make sense if you've read ""Through the Gates of the Silver Key""."
Lovecraft,3bugj2,Avagantamos101,5,Thu Jul 2 06:29:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree this is one of his best stories. What I found most intriguing was his parodying and almost mocking the tenants of German supremacy and even white supremacy. I know people are uncomfortable discussing his racism but for me, one of the things I find most intriguing is how strange and weird his racism was even for the time. To explain where I'm coming from, I read a lot of Civil War letters and journals from the South for research. He's totally different tonally and has an odd sense of awareness about it that is absent from most people of that era.    I think that much of his ideas about race are actually intrinsic to the nature of his mythos and cosmicism. Bringing it back to The Temple, part of what's engaging is that the German is encountering what is basically a superior alien species and he's not even aware of it. It's not even a competition. So many of Lovecraft's ideas about aliens comes from this basic idea of, ""If I'm superior to these races and these are my feelings of contempt, what must an alien think of me?""    Bonus: Here's a great podcast reading of this story, very well done."

I think hard sci fi has a lot more in common with Lovecraft than most horror writing.  He had concepts bigger than his writing ability, bigger than anyone's writing ability for that matter, but these guys glimpse it."
Lovecraft,3bugj2,Werewomble,4,Thu Jul 2 12:36:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree that he did not in fact go insane. It was quite interesting. Lovecraft went way out of his way to parody Germans in that story, to the point that it was a little absurd. But the one stereotype that he got right was that the German character was logical and analytical all the way through."
Lovecraft,3bugj2,McHardism,3,Thu Jul 2 12:52:50 2015 UTC,"The German is my favorite Lovecraft protagonist even though he's a caricature.  His devotion to science, even in the face of his own death, is inspiring.  His refusal to accept a supernatural explanation even when it's staring him in the face would be very impressive if he wasn't stuck in a Lovecraft story.  A true hero, except for that little thing about murdering every other human in the story."
Lovecraft,3bugj2,priestofazathoth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:40:56 2015 UTC,"OP, that sounds like something Clark Ashton Smith would write, he was one of HPLs closeest friends and corrospondants."
Lovecraft,3btx5f,PanSexualMan,2,Thu Jul 2 03:03:10 2015 UTC,"Downloaded Darkness Within 1 this morning because of your post, and I've been playing it for a couple of hours. Bearing in mind that I am only a couple of hours in and have not completed the game, I can say that so far I'm seeing a lot of similarities between this game and several stories, most notably The Festival and The Horror at Red Hook.  The main focus, at least at the moment in regards to where I am in the story, seems to be the well in the basement of Clark Field's house. There are mentions and suspicions of it being connected to a great network of tunnels and caves, which absolutely screams Red Hook to me, as in the story there is a network of underground canals and caves that are accessed via hidden wells and openings, which cultists use to navigate the town and also to chant and worship at night.  The monotonous chanting and use of instruments also seems very similar to the practices of the strange civilisation that is mentioned in the game.  The description of Clark Field's neighbourhood seems very similar to Lovecraft's description of Kingsport, the setting of The Festival. (Kingsport is also the manufacturer of the radio in Howard's apartment, nice little easter egg there.) The Festival also features a network of underground tunnels, in this story accessed by the basement of an old church, and similar to Red Hook ritualistic music is played within these caves.  There is also the madness aspect that a lot of Lovecraft's tales contain. When I started the game I was introduced to Howard writing a journal, questioning what he has seen and wondering how this affects his sanity. This can be found in a lot of tales, such as Dagon and The Statement of Randolph Carter.  I hope that answers your question, if you haven't read either of those stories I really recommend it, especially as The Festival is my favourite. Thanks for bringing the game to my attention through this post, I can't wait to finish it and start playing DW2!"
Lovecraft,3btx5f,KingGhidorable,2,Fri Jul 3 16:56:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! That is the best answer I have gotten. And I am really happy you got into the game! I liked it a lot, the second one is different, but I still like it, it is not point and click but I wont ruin anything about ir for you. And I rlwill for sure read those stories! I have yet to do so, so thanks a lot!"
Lovecraft,3btx5f,KingGhidorable,2,Fri Jul 3 20:05:58 2015 UTC,"Okay! Just finished the game! Boy have I got a lot to tell you...  I'll just start with character names and their connections to Lovecraft stories:  The man named Pickman, whom you encounter on the side of the road - Inspired by Lovecraft's tale Pickman's Model about an artist who creates terrifying images.  Howard's friend Arthur Jermyng - Inspired by Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and his Family, a story about a man who discovers that he is the last surviving ancestor of a strange lineage. (You can see that the game also draws from this plot point at the very end.)  Samuel Poer, who's crypt you find in the cemetery - Inspired by the family name de la Poer, to which the narrator of The Rats in the Walls belongs.  One of the coffins inside the Poer crypt has a name very similar to Abdul Alhazred, the mad Arab who wrote the Necronomicon.  The temples with the statues of reptilian humanoids and coffins inside alcoves within the walls are straight out of The Nameless City, it tells the story of a man who discovers a huge underground desert temple in which coffins line the walls of small tunnels and glyphs depict small humanoid creatures with heads similar to crocodiles.  There are also a few elements from The Shadow Over Innsmouth here and there, and there are many notes in the game that describe expeditions to odd places in deserts and jungles, a lot like the expeditions in The Shadow out of Time, The Late Arthur Jermyn and The Nameless City.  Basically, this game is an absolute gold mine of Lovecraft easter eggs, homages and references, and I'm very happy that I came across your post. I will download the sequel tomorrow and I suggest that you just go ahead and read every single thing that Lovecraft has ever written, you will not regret it!"
Lovecraft,3btx5f,Daimonin_123,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:46:53 2015 UTC,"Oh thank you so much! This is exactly the answer I was looking for. I had expected it was an amalgam of different Lovecraftian stories. De la Poer?  Samuel Poer? Damn I cant believe I didnt catch that. This game is actually what got me into Lovecraft in the first place. I have Lovecrafts complete works and am actually currently reading Call of Cthulhu, I just finished Shadow Over Innsmouth, I can really see the similarities now. And I will FOR SURE read all the ones you mentioned and then some.   One question, so there is nothing in Lovecraft about a Dversahe hallucinogen?  I am glad you enjoyed it! The second one is really good too and I cannot wait for your reply about that one, thanks again! And make sure you look up on the internet about all the hidden clues in both games, some are hard to find."

Lovecraft,3bp1wq,jaytchavez,52,Wed Jul 1 00:07:26 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of the original horror in Lovecraft (at least in his later writings) comes from his nihilism.  The idea that we are completely and utterly insignificant.  We don't matter, and nobody cares about it.  We weren't created by a benevolent force.  Best case scenario humanity was an accident that didn't get cleaned up by the elder things, or we were a joke.  The problem is that's not remotely new anymore.  A good portion of the population just takes that as fact (not the elder things bit, but the insignificance).  Then there's also the Seinfeld is unfunny problem.  Not only did Lovecraft pull influences from Poe, Dunsany, and many others, but he in turn has inspired countless other authors, artists, musicians, and filmmakers so that nearly everyone had experience SOME kind of Lovecraftian media.  Heck, the main premise of the first Mass Effect game was practically Lovecraft in space.  All that being said, it's still frightening on an intellectual level - the idea that there are forces beyond our comprehension out there that aren't malevolent (that implies there may be good guys, too), but that just don't give a shit about us.  And some of his stories, like the Colour out of Space, can still creep me out if I'm reading them alone at night.  EDIT:  Frankly, I'm a bit suspicious that Alan Moore is going to try to get us out of our comfort zone with tentacle rape."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,alexthehoopy,22,Wed Jul 1 03:22:05 2015 UTC,"still frightening on an intellectual level   I'd say it only ever was ""frightening on an intellectual level"". Because of the way the stories are written it's not something that makes you afraid to turn the page - it's more like you have to read the entire story and let your brain comprehend the implications of the conclusion."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,sleepymole,12,Wed Jul 1 08:20:17 2015 UTC,"That's very true.  There are a couple of stories that creep me out if I'm reading them in the suitable surroundings, but generally the most frightening parts are because of the implication."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,alexthehoopy,10,Wed Jul 1 13:49:57 2015 UTC,"I feel that you have definitely touched on the core of the problem. Another problem is that we have begun to focus on the elder gods as antagonist figures. They should never be viewed as such, as we do not view tornadoes, tsunamis, or mass extinction events as antagonist figures. The elder gods are a framework for the story, the antagonists are helplessness, fear, uncertainty and self loathing. The draw of Lovecraft is that we lose to those antagonists."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,Old_Trees,8,Wed Jul 1 12:05:09 2015 UTC,"Heck, the main premise of the first Mass Effect game was practically Lovecraft in space.   You exist because we allow it, and you will end because we demand it"
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,Gingrel,9,Wed Jul 1 07:18:45 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I'm a bit suspicious that Alan Moore is going to try to get us out of our comfort zone with tentacle rape.   One of the few things I felt worked in Neonomicon (and I really mean few, I thought the ending sucked) was how the rape scene as it played out against reader expectations.  I imagine a fair few people were hoping for some T&A when they learned the protagonist was a nymphomaniac, but what they got instead was her being violently assaulted by a group of normie cultists. Not very sexy.  The scene contributed to the theme of sexual dysfunction running through the story, which is something Moore has been very vocal about when talking Lovecraft."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,MrCarcosa,8,Wed Jul 1 13:27:49 2015 UTC,"That's actually a good point and I hadn't thought of that.  Generally I hate that kind of thing.  I've never been on board with the whole repressed sexual stuff that a lot of people see or read into Lovecraft (not saying it's a complete load, I've just never cared and it's never interested me).  I completely missed the subversion of expectation, and I now dislike Neonomicon a bit less."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,alexthehoopy,4,Wed Jul 1 13:48:14 2015 UTC,"From what correspondence I've read Howard 'did his duty' as a husband, and wasn't all that bad. But I think his awkwardness in sexual matters was just a part of his greater social problems.  I'm on the fence about Moore's interpretation of Lovecraft's 'nameless rituals'; I feel their vague description is more to do with writing effective cosmic horror than anything else."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,MrCarcosa,3,Wed Jul 1 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"It's pretty hard to argue anything else, really.  ""The oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.""  Or, to paraphrase Yahtzee ""all a good horror game needs to do is hand you the sandpaper while you vigorously massage your own undercarriage.""  If you're scared or made uncomfortable by sex, that's what the rituals will involve for you. The beauty of leaving it vague (which Lovecraft often did very well) is that it lets you fill in the blanks with the worst thing you can imagine."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,alexthehoopy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for that. I've been wondering for the longest time what the point was of her being a nymphomaniac.  The ending made Neonomicon, imo. All throughout, there's been this motif of the decidedly ""unnameable"" horrors of Lovecraft being related to sex, which makes sense given biographical anecdotes of the guy being deeply grossed out by it even as an adult. The Old Ones' apparent timelessness turning out to be just ripples from the higher dimension of Leng into our dimension, and the conception of the Old Ones as perceived within our dimension to have been a result of the nastiness we've just been witnessing, is a kind of narrative coup de grace where the cosmic and the sexual are finally, ruthlessly mashed together where there had hitherto been only a kind of foreplay in the form of a mere side-by-side juxtaposition (I'm sorry, I just had to).   Come to think of it, I've just been skimming through Issue #4 and on page 4 where Brears comes out of the water, in the narration, she describes a dream where she meets Lovecraft. She's naked and has a tentacle where her hoo-ha should be. Lovecraft sees this and starts screaming. I'm reaching here, but this could in effect be symbolic of Moore's estimation of his contributions to Lovecraft's mythos, compared to Lovecraft's work itself. Naked Brears + tentacle penis = Neonomicon with its combination of cosmic horror and weird sex shit, and Lovecraft screaming = how he would react to Neonomicon as such. Moore is in effect reaming Lovecraft with Neonomicon, and now he's at it again with Providence. What a sick fuck. Poor Howie."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,TobiBaronski,11,Fri Jul 10 21:39:55 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I'm a bit suspicious that Alan Moore is going to try to get us out of our comfort zone with tentacle rape.   Given the way his last Lovecraft story went, I'm certain that is exactly what is going to happen."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,JackalKing,17,Wed Jul 1 06:38:32 2015 UTC,"I think he's right. I don't think Moore has any interest in publiciity stunts, he simply speaks his mind. As far as I see, his comments are a reaction to two developments in the culture:  1) 'Cute-thulhu', an element of the culture which parodies the Derlethian perspective of the Mythos.  2) The Derlethian perspective itself, which tries to systematise Lovecraft's work, and paints his gods and monsters as immoral, rather than ammoral.  Lovecraft isn't about tentacles, cyclopean structures and the Doom of Mankind. These are means to explore themes of inheritance, helplessness, and our insignificance in the grand scheme of things.  Providence #1 feels like a return to Lovecraft for me. It shies away from most of the usual imagery, mysterious manuscripts exempted, and delivers a tale of horror grounded in reality and resonant with the world today. I hope further issues try to remain as mundane."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,MrCarcosa,7,Wed Jul 1 09:48:49 2015 UTC,"The immoral vs amoral distortion in most Lovecraft-inspired media is disappointing. The gods and monsters don't hate mankind, they're not even malevolent. They'd just kill an entire species effortlessly because they can and it wouldn't bother them, not because they're some form of evil within them that they're acting on. They 'are' evil, as men know it, but their moral evil as men see it comes from the perspective of the mortal at threat. The gods in his stories have no sense of right-vs-wrong. Nobody can convey that properly, it seems. All the tales seem to be turned into a sort of 'good vs ultimate evil' scenario. They'd kill us like you'd step on a ant hill or raid spray a bees nest. Most people wouldnt even think about it, and that's what makes the monsters so terrifying. Because they haven't yet, though they could. None of his stories ever seem to be at a point where a typical story would begin, because nothing has happened yet.  Honestly, in that sense, George RR fucking Martin is the only popular author that comes to mind who has properly hidden away his form of 'cosmic horror' behind an adequate veil of forbidden/lost knowledge. His story has a hero and his 'gods' can apparently be defeated, so it's completely different, but he nails this addressed point in that the major godly forces in his stories are largely amoral-seeming (or at least morally vague, though presented as a threat through petty humans), probably only at war with eachother and utterly unconcerned with the fate of mortal man."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,the--mannequin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:19:32 2015 UTC,Not quite everyone who is influenced by Lovecraft writes about good v evil - not even everyone but George.
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,RamseyCampbell,2,Thu Jul 2 09:46:08 2015 UTC,"1) 'Cute-thulhu', an element of the culture which parodies the Derlethian perspective of the Mythos.   That stuff can get so annoying, it's like people ignore the stories and ideas altogether in favour of a popular image.  But the upside is that it may make more people curious to actually sit down and read Lovecraft, which is never a bad thing."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,The7thNomad,7,Fri Jul 3 11:59:37 2015 UTC,"That you can buy Great Cthulhu plushie toys and a thousand other bits of cutesy merchandise is evidence Moore is onto something.   All monsters have a way of becoming acceptable over history. Look at Godzilla, transforming from nightmarish metaphor for nuclear annihilation to doting dad and defender of Japan. Or trace the evolution from Dracula to Twilight. Unicorns used to be destructive creatures, and now they're cute porcelain figures on girls' bedsides."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,ptupper,6,Wed Jul 1 18:22:31 2015 UTC,"Or Odin's portrayal in a lot of media as a kindly grandfather figure instead of his actual role as (among other things) god of berserker fury in battle,, master manipulator, a devious sorcerer, and lord of death, picking souls of the fallen from the battlefield."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,manimatr0n,6,Wed Jul 1 20:19:23 2015 UTC,"I think what he meant was that Cthulhu and the bestiary are now so well-known and pervasive in fantasy and horror literature, that they obscure the original nihilism with their familiar tentacles rather than illustrate it."

Lovecraft,3bp1wq,theslyder,3,Wed Jul 1 07:45:48 2015 UTC,"Knowing Alan Moore and how he usually speaks about things, I feel like what he meant was that people are projecting him into this light of popularity that his work wasn't really meant to be in. He wrote short stories for magazines and commissions so in a way his work was never really meant to reach the mainstream public. I think he's also speaking about the genre of horror that Lovecraft is  known for. Much like how people don't really find the original slasher movies ""scary"" anymore...it's become a horror story that doesn't instill horror because its played out. I am not saying Lovecraft's writing is played out at all...honestly, The Colour Out of Space and The Music of Erich Zann were some of the finest literature in the horror/fantasy genre I have ever read, these are just thoughts..."
Lovecraft,3bp1wq,ImaginaryFri3nd,3,Wed Jul 1 01:54:22 2015 UTC,"I was never really uncomfortable with Lovecraft. I heard about him, read the books myself, and I just felt the entire cosmic insignificance thing just made so much sense."

Lovecraft,3bapv4,stoneleafuk,2,Sat Jun 27 18:38:37 2015 UTC,"Read this one a while ago. A bit short, but a good read and a strong protagonist, and the author's earlier short story collection Shadows From Norwood (which I thought I read as an ebook, but is now out of print?) was a very nicely-done take on some classic bits of Lovecraft, shifted to South London and explored with some nice touches of scientific speculation."
Lovecraft,3bapv4,gurneyslade,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:56:39 2015 UTC,Thanks -- Shadows from Norwood is being re-released this summer by PS Publishing under the title The Dulwich Horror & Others. The Harry Stubbs story continues with the sequel Broken Meats (pm me for a review copy...)

Lovecraft,3bapqs,ltkessler,19,Sat Jun 27 11:57:50 2015 UTC,"In all types of art, it is important to separate the artist from his work. Lovecraft created something unique, that lives on to this day, but he was a bona fide racist, probably due to his own misanthropy and debilitating fear of the other, fueled by the popular pseudoscientific racial theories of the time. After all, Robert Heinlein had strong slight fascist leanings, and Crichton denied peer-reviewed science to claim man-made global warming wasn't real. Even despicable people can produce great art, and in that sense the art not only outlives them, but eclipses the reality of who they were, the good and the bad."

Lovecraft,3bapqs,Lord_Firestorm,5,Fri Jul 3 13:13:57 2015 UTC,"Fascist leanings?    I've always interpreted Heinlein's work as having a strong Libertarian leaning. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress features a character based on Heinlein himself who advocates for 'rational anarchy,' The Rolling Stones, Stranger in a Strange Land, Glory Road, and everything written about Lazarus Long feature strong anti-establishment themes, and both his first novel, For Us, The Living and most of his future-history short stories discuss an idealized society in which the only law is not to hurt other citizens. Even Starship Troopers, despite the description of a post-democratic militaristic world society, is focused on duty and individual responsibility rather than service to an overarching state.    Heinlein was a horny old man and a narcissist, but I don't think he was anything close to a fascist."
Lovecraft,3bapqs,archiesteel,4,Sat Jun 27 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"I've read arguments that go both ways, but even if he wasn't one can find other examples of writers whose personal opinions are unsavory while their prose is of high quality. I could have mentioned Orson Scott Card instead - I enjoyed Ender's Game but his views on the War on Terror, homosexuality and evolution are a bit disconcerting. He even got on the Benghazi bandwagon...  Anyway, the goal isn't to put anyone on trial here, just making the point that it's important to separate the artist from his work. We could look at musicians for even more striking examples."

The same concept can be applied to politicians and their policies, or inventors and their inventions. For example, we celebrate Thomas Jefferson for drafting the Declaration of Independence, overseeing the Louisiana Purchase, and generally shaping the government of America, despite the fact that he was a slave owner and fathered several children with one of his female slaves."

Lovecraft,3bapqs,sheriff_gingerbeard,2,Sat Jun 27 21:49:36 2015 UTC,"It's important to recognize the value of someone's work even if they had hateful and negative qualities, but it's essential not to separate the artist from his or her work. I mean, you should look at a text on its own, and I agree we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater in regard to Lovecraft's work vis-a-vis his racism. But we need to keep his racism in our minds when we read his stories, because a fundamental quality to many of his horrors are rooted in fear of the unknown, and Lovecraft perfectly exemplifies how easily that fear can translate into xenophobia and racism. I don't think his stories are inherently racist or xenophobic, but they represent a (almost universal, and incredibly human) fear that is the root of many instances of those problems. To me, that's one of the most important things about Lovecraft as a writer and human being. He reveals how fear, a fear that speaks to most people, can manifest in truly terrible ways. So, to me, it's important not to separate the two, but also not to dismiss  him and his works in their entirety because of that quality."
Lovecraft,3bapqs,heresybob,21,Mon Jun 29 01:57:18 2015 UTC,"Phenomenal blog post about Lovecraft's racism.   Personally, I've always felt that he, in his heart, was a coward - with a driving imagination that forced him to write.  His characters are all cowards who have run from horrible truths and one lost ace away from the loony bin. The guy dies alone, in poverty, pretty much from malnutrition and apparently refused any doctor's service. In short, he self-sabotaged his way to greatness.   In De Camp's biography, while it touches on the racism, it more than focuses on his inabilty to control his opinions and expectations."
Lovecraft,3bapqs,AncientHistory,17,Sat Jun 27 13:34:54 2015 UTC,"It is a good blog post, and Leeman is a class act. It's important for the man to be presented as he was, warts and all, not as a whitewashed saint of letters with all his sins swept under the rug or as a racist cartoon character.  I would hardly cite de Camp's bio for anything, though.  It is very easy, now that Lovecraft is dead and we have all this information about his life, to go into full 20/20 hindsight mode and say ""Well yes, of course he should have taken up the editorship of Weird Tales"" and ""Oh, it was obvious his marriage was going to be a train wreck from the beginning"" right down to ""Y'know, if he spent more than $1.40 a week on groceries, maybe he wouldn't have been shitting blood."" But if someone took such a microscope to our own existences, I'm sure they would find similar faults and errors. Lovecraft was a guy whom, for all his obvious intelligence and talents, was stuck in a not-great situation - by nature or by circumstance, he failed to gain the qualifications that might have landed him a position commensurate with the upbringing he might have expected; he was unable to land or keep a regular job using his skills, and largely unwilling to or unable to sacrifice artistic integrity in the name of commercialism, even as some of his friends like E. Hoffmann Price were able to do. There are some object lessons in his life for other people to learn, and some meat to chew on and think over in terms of our own life."
Lovecraft,3bapqs,heresybob,3,Sat Jun 27 14:47:35 2015 UTC,What's wrong with de Camp's bio?  It was written in the 70s and been recognized for its direct honesty about Lovecraft.
Lovecraft,3bapqs,AncientHistory,8,Sat Jun 27 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"Well, no. It was published in 1975 and was recognized and decried for de Camp getting his personal opinions and pet theories and criticisms of Lovecraft out - much as, sometime later, he did with his Robert E. Howard bio, Dark Valley Destiny. That isn't to say that de Camp didn't do some solid research, but the book has since been entirely superseded by later, more accurate, less biased, and more complete biographies, especially I Am Providence."

You would be more ostracized for defending blacks, Italians, Irish and Jews in pre-WWII America. Lovecraft was a very talented horror writer, but he lived a very sheltered life, and wasn't an outgoing man. It wasn't until later in life, like his marriage where he started take a more open mind and regret some of his more bigoted instincts."

Lovecraft,3b3ioc,moistyorifices,2,Fri Jun 26 09:52:28 2015 UTC,"I always loved that story, mostly because, to me, it showed that all the horror of our tiny place in the universe and how powerless we are is a temporary and relative thing. That creatures not very much different from us rose and fell and waged war against the likes of Cthulhu to meet their end only at their own hubris, and even now there may be enough survivors in the ice for them to begin making a comeback."

Lovecraft,3b3ioc,King_Buliwyf,12,Thu Jun 25 18:13:04 2015 UTC,"Nope. He has some stand-alone horror stories, much in the style of Edgar Allen Poe. He also has the ""Dream Cycle"" that takes place in and around the Dreamlands. Though whether this is connected directly to the Cthulhu Mythos is debatable. They aren't really mutually exclusive. Lots of great stories in the Dream Cycle as well:  Also, please add At The Mountains Of Madness to the original list."
Lovecraft,3b3ioc,King_Buliwyf,3,Thu Jun 25 18:23:49 2015 UTC,Gotcha. I thought the Dream Cycle was officially part of the Mythos for some reason.
Lovecraft,3b3ioc,Marv134,7,Thu Jun 25 18:27:00 2015 UTC,"Well, like I said, nothing about it is really contrary to the Mythos. So you can definitely see them as being in the same universe with no real trouble. Some people just see them differently.  But actually, now that i think about it, At The Mountains Of Madness is sort of the bridge between the Mythos and the Cycle."
Lovecraft,3b3ioc,Malgas,13,Thu Jun 25 18:28:38 2015 UTC,The Dream Cycle is in the mythos. Dreamquest of Unknown Kadath mentions Azathoth and has a central scene with Nyarlathotep and also references it being in the same dreamworld as the previous dream cycle stories.
Lovecraft,3b3ioc,bjh13,2,Thu Jun 25 19:47:33 2015 UTC,"More evidence:  The Case of Charles Dexter Ward has references to Yog-Sothoth, the Sign of Koth, and Randolph Carter.  Out of the Aeons mentions Yuggoth and has an appearance by Carter (albeit as Swami Chandraputra)."

His stories are unofficially categorized as the macabre cycle, which are more traditional, stand-alone horror, the dream cycle which is a little more high fantasy, and the mythos cycle, which is existential, weird, and scifi.  That being said, the (imo) most quintessential dream cycle story, the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath, references Nyarlathotep and some other mythos stuff directly, so while it certainly can be read stand-alone I also think it is certainly part of the mythos."

Lovecraft,3b3ioc,idontreadorfollow,3,Thu Jun 25 22:14:46 2015 UTC,"I can only think of some Clark Ashton Smith stories, those of his Hyperborea cycle, because they feature characters and locations which HPL references in his own stories such as Commoriom and Uzuldaroum,  Eibon which is the author of the Book of Eibon and probably most importantly Tsathoggua, a god originally created by Smith but which Lovecraft very much favored and whose mythology he expanded upon.  I don't know how ""essential"" these stories are but at the very least they are a good (for the most part) addendum to the mythos."
Lovecraft,3b3ioc,Barl3000,3,Thu Jun 25 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"In addition to the stories people have been submitting, I'd also like to add Nyarlathotep. It's short and it gives you insight into another level of the Mythos of something that is actually malicious rather than something that is ""evil"" by merely existing. Some people may disagree, but I think it's a very important story."
Lovecraft,3b3ioc,JasonMcKittrick,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:43:08 2015 UTC,"Actually a lot of the ""modern"" feel of the mythos also came from August Derleth, I am not that well-versed in him though."

Lovecraft,3b0wfz,Darth_Squid,5,Thu Jun 25 02:01:52 2015 UTC,"Well he has a thousand forms, but the one you're talking about is described vaguely in August Derleth's The Dweller in Darkness, but cemented by the Call of Cthulhu RPG.  This article is a pretty fun read on how awful, yet influential, a story it is!"
Lovecraft,3b0wfz,GirlGargoyle,3,Thu Jun 25 02:12:48 2015 UTC,"While ""Dweller"" definitely made the mold for a tentacled-headed Crawling Chaos, I suppose some note should be given to ""Haunter in the Dark"", in which the Haunter with the three-lobed burning eye is linked to Nyarly in I believe the earliest non-human form."
Lovecraft,3b0wfz,wyrmis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:59:14 2015 UTC,I think I read that one but it was about a guy's head in a basement. No description of Nyarlothotep.
Lovecraft,3b0wfz,ButtsexEurope,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:58:25 2015 UTC,"Neither story is about anything like that. You surely can't be thinking of one called ""Heading Home""?"
Lovecraft,3b0wfz,RamseyCampbell,4,Thu Jun 25 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"I believe part of it comes from The Thing in the Moonlight   I leaped up at once & raced madly out of that car & away across endless leagues of plateau till exhaustion waked me—doing this not because the conductor had dropped on all fours, but because the face of the motorman was a mere white cone tapering to one blood-red tentacle. . . ."
Lovecraft,3b0wfz,Archangel_Azrael,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"I think that makes sense. While the Thing in the Moonlight is not linked (in the story, at least, though maybe in later stories) to Nyarlathotep, the sort of faceless, cone-shaped head (even when the other extremities are noted as being tentacle shaped) is such a specific description that I can easily imagine it getting ported over. Especially when, in the extended version of ""Moonlight"", Miske makes the dream-world a place in which you can be trapped, and has this line - ""But suddenly I parted the weeds and saw before me the ancient railway car—and to one side a cone-faced thing lifted its head and in the streaming moonlight howled strangely!"" - which seems very similar to some of the staging in Derleth's. It might be a sign of extending ""The Motorman"" into a proto-N."
Lovecraft,3b0wfz,wyrmis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:59:23 2015 UTC,"If you go to japan, Nyarlathotep looks like this."
Lovecraft,3b0wfz,KinkotheClown,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:45:04 2015 UTC,That's like saying if you go to America Cthulu is a cute plushie. That series is obviously comedy and isn't meant to represent Lovecraftian mythos except as silly parody.

Lovecraft,3az0e9,Malgas,9,Thu Jun 25 12:40:35 2015 UTC,I feel like many people who watch True Detective miss some of the depths of the Mythos in that show. Not that it's that subtle; but a lot of people who enjoy the show might not even recognize the supernatural elements as being distinctly Mythos-oriented.
Lovecraft,3az0e9,Kexizzoc,6,Wed Jun 24 20:00:23 2015 UTC,"More Chambers than Lovecraft, though.  (At least in the first season, I haven't started watching the second yet.)"

Lovecraft,3az0e9,m_faustus,7,Thu Jun 25 01:22:10 2015 UTC,"The single greatest Lovecraft pastiche that I've ever read is Black Man with a Horn by T. E. D. Klein. It uses some of Lovecraft's letters to craft the narrative. Either pick up The Book of Cthulhu, which also includes some other terrific mythos related fiction (The Men from Porlock by Laird Barron; Nethescurial by Thomas Ligotti; etc) or just get the Klein collection Dark Gods, which is simply great. Either way, you can't go wrong."
Lovecraft,3az0e9,celticwhisper,2,Wed Jun 24 21:14:40 2015 UTC,"I agree.  That's the best one I have read.  Second would be ""Sticks"" by Karl Edward Wagner."
Lovecraft,3az0e9,Omnipolis,6,Thu Jun 25 00:29:28 2015 UTC,Get yourself a GameCube or Wii.  Play you some Eternal Darkness.  The whole thing is a giant love letter to Lovecraft and his fans.

They never reference Lovecraft expressly but the influence is there the whole way through. You even enter several dream worlds. That game got me into Lovecraft."
Lovecraft,3az0e9,babbarker,4,Fri Jun 26 12:24:46 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite Metallica songs, The Thing that Should Not Be is fantastic Lovecraftian fare. Call of Ktulu is also one of there's but not quite as good. Both of these songs were influential in getting me interested in Lovecraft.   Also, anything by /u/sharkchild has been great. While his stories aren't direct references to Lovecraft's work they are very close cousins."
Lovecraft,3az0e9,lobo91011,3,Fri Jun 26 13:26:45 2015 UTC,"The Black Stone, by Robert E. Howard. November 1931.  You can go to Wikipedia for the high notes, but that's no fun.  The original story is short and well worth the read.  This story features many staples of the Mythos and, like most of Howard's work, is filled with thrills and horror aplenty. It is one of my favorite short stories and incredibly satisfying to read.  The H.P. Lovecraft Literary Podcast recently covered it too!  Edit: Ha! Re-read your original request and this is clearly not what you were looking for as it's not subtle and it's definitely a foundation of the mythos! I need more coffee..."

I'd definitely still recommend it, as it's an incredibly atmospheric horror flick with an interesting premise (minor spoiler: it's partially inspired by Richard Dawkins' Viruses of the Mind.) Plus Stephen McHattie has a voice like smooth whiskey.  Hellboy is an absolute must-see, although if you're subscribed here you've probably already seen it!  John Dies at the End is great as well if you're into campy horror."
Lovecraft,3asy6d,bohemica,5,Tue Jun 23 12:51:53 2015 UTC,I just want to listen to things that sound like the radio intro to Pontypool
Lovecraft,3asy6d,shhimhuntingrabbits,3,Tue Jun 23 14:20:03 2015 UTC,No joke. Such a fantastic film.
Lovecraft,3asy6d,solo9,2,Tue Jun 23 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"Love that movie. A friend turned me on to it randomly one day. I had no expectations he was just like ""watch this"" mind blown. I can totally see this as more horrible than a standard horror. More creeping dread of the unknown. Claustrophobic. Everything is familiar but wrong, it made me feel like I was learning a second language that only I can speak. Am I still writing? This doesn't even feel like typing, are my lips moving?"
Lovecraft,3asy6d,TheWarpedOne,4,Tue Jun 23 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"Wait, Pontypool is set in Canada, not Wales? Damn. I'll have to give it a closer look."
Lovecraft,3asy6d,Ghostwoods,3,Tue Jun 23 17:50:51 2015 UTC,I liked reading John dies at the end. I feel like a lot of the author's wording and comedic timing really made the story. The film kinda felt like a disjointed mess.
Lovecraft,3asy6d,solo9,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do agree that the book was better. IIRC the film changed some details and cut out a huge plot point that was a pivotal moment in the original story. It might have been a disappointment to fans of the book, but I still think the film was decent fun and worth a watch even if it isn't quite as good as its source material."
Lovecraft,3asy6d,bohemica,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yup. A lot of the zaniness in the book followed organically from the character development and there was even some pathos, especially with the plot twist towards the end.  The movie just focused on the zaniness, like, oh, look, meat monster! Bratwurst phone! Paul Giamatti!"
Lovecraft,3asy6d,TobiBaronski,3,Sat Jun 27 02:35:17 2015 UTC,"Pontypool was a great film. I don't know if I would call it Lovecraftian either.

Lovecraft,3asy6d,deviger,2,Tue Jun 23 19:44:16 2015 UTC,"(Spoilers going forward) Pontypool is lovecraftian because it is about an interdimensional force corrupting the minds of humans, for most of the movie the events are told second hand using the unreliable narrator idea."

You have regular people in a certain situation, some totally, well, Lovecraftian being come in, starts messing up stuff. Some people live, some people die, some people lose their minds.

They kept up the mystery long enough to suck you into just abour thinking the ancient evil is some Elder thing, only to bring it round to plain old demons, and then they don't even tell you what's up with the demons really. Decent enough movie, but not really Lovecraftian imo, tho your mileage may vary"

I've noticed that a lot of people don't differentiate between the different subgenres and most people use the term lovecraftian to describe the whole weird fiction genre rather than it's specific area.

Lovecraft,3an6wi,HappyPenguinInc,42,Sun Jun 21 21:40:37 2015 UTC,"It's just that it has nothing to do with Lovecraft.  Lovecraft would die of laughter before he got halfway through Simon's Necronomicon.   Basically, some people (99% of the people on this sub) like Lovecraft because he wrote good fiction, whereas the people who read Simon's want to believe that Lovecraftian monsters actually exist and have magical powers.  You can see how the first group might deride the second, especially when the second group's make-believe gets mixed up with Lovecraft's public image, making people less likely to take him seriously as literature."
Lovecraft,3an6wi,priestofazathoth,28,Sun Jun 21 22:26:14 2015 UTC,"not to be a dick, but you give the community on this sub way too much credit. I seriously cringe at all the cthulhu fanclub posts I see on here. unfortunately, I think the people here who actually appreciate lovecraft for his work, and not just his tentacle monsters, are in the minority."
Lovecraft,3an6wi,lucidlife9,10,Mon Jun 22 03:28:31 2015 UTC,"Truly. I get so angry when I see cutsie renditions of cthulhu and him incorporated into comics and as generally a prop anywhere else. If you're not going to appreciate the subtly of his use, don't use him. The public view on lovecraft's work is essentially ""the cthulhu guy"" and yeah thats one of his most popular monsters/stories but the dude changed an era of horror and wrote some of the best literature in the recent age. There's more to it than cults and flying tentical monsters."

Call of Cthulhu was a good one.  Edit: Just wanted to clarify, I don't like Cthulhu the most. I kind of worded it like it was, but it's not my favorite. I still enjoy it though."
Lovecraft,3an6wi,ChokeZero,3,Mon Jun 22 11:54:19 2015 UTC,"I quite agree. My personal favorite deity is Nyarlathotep, but if someone like C'thulhu more then that's fair enough."

As an example, the Star Wars movies aren't about the stormtroopers, but that doesn't stop fans from thinking the stormtroopers are awesome. It even led to more focus on them in video games and other Star Wars media."
Lovecraft,3an6wi,ChokeZero,4,Mon Jun 22 17:08:01 2015 UTC,"my ultimate point being, that if there is to be an obsession over just one of the elements of lovecraft's work (cthulhu) then it should be taken to r/cthulhu. because I, as well as others here, want this sub to be about lovecraft appreciation. its frustrating to see something you love be trivialized down to a single element that is vaguely representative of its origins. cthulhu has just merely become a pop-culture icon, and little more. I'm subscribed to this sub because I have read so much of lovecraft's work, and I appreciate it.   It's comparable to having the majority of the users of r/thegreatgatsby (just an example, not saying this is true) constantly post pictures of clothes from the 1920's because they just really liked the 20's. They threw away any appreciation for the original source material. To these hypothetical people, The Great Gatsby is nothing more to them than just a look back into the 20's. But the book was clearly more than that. and it should be appreciated for more than just the style of clothing that was used in the book.   Lovecraft is more than cthulhu. And if thats all that people care about him, then they can just take it somewhere else."

Lovecraft,3an6wi,MrDudle,31,Mon Jun 22 11:39:49 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of good reasons.  It's a hoax. But it's not a particularly interesting hoax. De Camp's Al Azif and The Hay Necronomicon are both hoaxes, but tongue-in-cheek hoaxes, the kind that don't deliberately mislead the reader. The Libri Prohibiti Necronomicon is pretty as all-get-out, even if not as clever as the Book of Dead Names. The Simon Necronomicon, by contrast, is designed to deceive the gullible. There's no in-jokes, no nod-and-wink to the reader - indeed, there's no acknowledgement beyond a couple names that the authors are at all familiar with Lovecraft. ""Simon"" (Peter Levenda) just feels fine with misdirecting people for a cash-grab, and he's still at it. Which brings us to the next point...  It's not Lovecraftian. All Necronomicons are hoaxes, but most of them make at least an attempt to conform to the source material that Lovecraft & co. provided. But not the Simon Necronomicon. While it does provide something like a full grimoire - which other attempts have not done - aside from a couple names, it doesn't even pay lip service to Lovecraft's Mythos, or contain any of the few passages Lovecraft quotes from the book in his fiction. The Simon Necronomicon is just a plain example of Did Not Do the Research...  It Isn't Even Pretty. There's one or two special editions which are in hardcovers and fairly nice to look at, but most readers don't see those. They're relatively scarce and expensive. Which isn't saying much, because most people won't see those editions; they'll see the cheap Avon paperbacks which are ubiquitous in stores, Khem Caigan's sigil smudged and blurred from too many reproductions.  It's Popular. This sounds like the ""hipster"" reason, but there's some truth to it. The Simon Necronomicon and its various sequels are the most popular and influential of the Necronomicons, and have inspired both a good deal of occult practictionars and, sadly, misled a fair number of the weird fiction target audience with it's bullshit. The Simon Necronomicon is a drab, boring cash-grab that devalues Lovecraftian fiction by association, but it's popularity means that Lovecraft fans have a hard time escaping from its influence. The Simon Necronomicon cover sigil, the one that looks like a pentragram drawn by an anti-conjurer on mescaline, is often used as a catch-all evocative icon to represent the Mythos.  Which I think is a good summary of the major points."
Lovecraft,3an6wi,AncientHistory,3,Sun Jun 21 23:37:59 2015 UTC,"In defense of the pentagram thing, the Elder Sign looks like a pentagram too. The ugly thing on the Simon book is obviously not the Elder Sign, but I can sort of understand the use of a pentagram. And I see the Elder Sign used as a symbol for the Mythos more often than that pentafuckup."

Lovecraft,3an6wi,wildebeestsandangels,4,Mon Jun 22 02:04:09 2015 UTC,"The wikipedia page for it states ""Mythos writer August Derleth described the sign as a warped five pointed star with a flaming pillar (or eye) in its center"".  Although it also had a picture of a twig thing that was apparently how Lovecraft himself depicted the Elder Sign. But I think I like Derleth's better than the twig thing."

The original Schlangekraft was nothing worth getting in a tizzy over, unless you're hot and bothered about first editions; the second edition is the desirable one in terms of appearance, and was a limited edition leatherbound hardcover, which is why the price is proportionately higher (~US$300 is the median, it looks like); the 31st anniversary edition is also a hardback, but not as swanky (~US$80)."
Lovecraft,3an6wi,AncientHistory,12,Mon Jun 22 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"It's tacky New Age dreck in Lovecraftian drag designed to cash in on a fad. It came about in the 1970s when occultism was trendy in popular culture due to movies like The Exorcist and books like The Amityville Horror. The advent of the occult specialty market with publishers like Llwellyn and Magickal Childe pushing out rebranded versions of dry and long-winded esoteric texts from late Victorian era as ""secret doctrines of forbidden arts"" and assorted crap played a part, too.  Check out ""The Necronomicon Files"" for the story behind it and other versions of the Necronomicon"
Lovecraft,3an6wi,PhyrexianDildo,13,Sun Jun 21 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"Basically, it shoehorns Lovecraft into Babylonian mythology. There are none of the references found in the short stories, and the use of ancient Babylonian gods makes it a little more... tame, for lack of a better word."
Lovecraft,3an6wi,Arhadamanthus,5,Sun Jun 21 22:24:25 2015 UTC,"An actual Necronomicon book takes away from the mystery of a fictional one. No one could possibly be able to produce a book that would be as terrifying or disturbing as the ""real"" one, and thus any attempts are doomed to failure.  Incidentally, I also believe this is why most film adaptation of Cthulhu mythos stories are disappointing. The unspeakable horrors are much scarier when they remain vague, unseen and purely the product of our own feverish imaginations. When someone else gives them shape or form, it's not uncommon to find them less nightmarish.  Fear of the unknown is very powerful. When the unknown becomes known, it becomes a bit less fearful, IMHO.  Edit: fixed some awkward sentence structure. Going to bed now."

Lovecraft,3an6wi,4to6,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:03:32 2015 UTC,"I feel people tend to forget that in the Cthulhu mythos the Necronomicon was written by ""The Mad Arab"" which I'm pretty sure that Yemen shared the Sumerian  mythology. And the names Cthulhu, Nytharlotep, etc. I forget where, but I read that the Necronomicon was translated into latin, I feel that Simon was trying to go by a non- translated copy. Which seems valid compared to what people say about the book."
Lovecraft,3an6wi,__Rorschach____,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"I think people on here have pretty much said what needs to be said -- the Simon Necronomicon is nothing to do with Lovecraft; it's a hoax (or a cash-in), but not a particularly funny, well-informed or well-executed one.   I think it's also that it is now pretty prominently associated in people's minds with Lovecraft and his work, which makes it even more annoying for people who already don't think much of it.   It's also one of those things that serves as an insider/outsider distinction. If you know your stuff, you know it's been thoroughly debunked and explained; if you're outside the loop, you might still wonder if it's authentic, not because you're stupid but just because you've never looked into the question. And insiders get annoyed by outsiders with the same old question, while outsiders get annoyed with being patronised by insiders, and nobody wins."
Lovecraft,3aliya,jaytchavez,27,Sun Jun 21 11:38:50 2015 UTC,"""Shadow Over Innsmouth"". Without spoilers, its ending is fairly unique in tone to a lot of Lovecraft's."

Lovecraft,3aliya,Zind3r,5,Sun Jun 21 14:19:41 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, though what I was thinking about was more the way the protagonist calmly internalizes and accepts their place in the horror.

Lovecraft,3aliya,wyrmis,7,Sun Jun 21 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"That's very interesting, I hadn't considered that. It might be that the narrator has not gone mad at all, but only accepted the natural order of things and his place in them.

It's one of those moments I think HPL strove most for: simple awe and terror at the recognition of time and space's unimaginable scope. I think that's the story that communicates it the best, and I can still remember reading it for the first time. It's not a shocking twist, you know it's coming, but the delivery still has an unexpected impact."

Lovecraft,3amlu8,thewriter1,3,Sun Jun 21 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with Ashearmstong -- first get it edited (or at the very, very least proof read) . I thoroughly recommend Red Adept Editing. Then you can start on the long road of agents and publishers (which is hard if you are not a known writer), or the short and easy (but not necessarily lucrative) road of self-publishing.  I'm now working on my second collection of stories, and contemplating a third Harry Stubbs mythos adventure."
Lovecraft,3amlu8,wembley66,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:42:10 2015 UTC,"Short, yes, easy, I would disagree with. At least if you want your stuff to not look terrible. Though it does get easier the more familiar you get with formatting and whatnot."

Lovecraft,3amlu8,RamseyCampbell,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:20:40 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. My thinking is that, especially as a newcomer, you want to make the best possible impression and the batlle to crawl out of the primeval slushpile is fierce. If the first thing a reader spots is a pair of typos on page 1 that you somehow missed (which I do all the time), you're right back in the slime."

There you can also sell it and the platform takes care of everything. Would love to see what you come up with, so do post in the subreddit when you're ready and you can show it off. But remember that if you post it online for free, some publishers may not want to purchase it, because it has been released already."
Lovecraft,3amlu8,nechoventsi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:29:58 2015 UTC,"1) If you want to have a publisher get it, you'll need to query an agent, who will then attempt to find a publisher for you. Sometimes, publishers are small enough to accept unsolicited works, but for the most part, you'll need to find an agent.  2) Self-publish. You have a lot of options. Smashwords, as mentioned already but a warning from someone who's used it: You'll need to follow the Smashwords Style Guide closely and a lot of people find it very frustrating. There's also Kindle Direct. Easier than Smashwords for formatting. Do NOT us Kindle Select unless you're okay with being exclusive to Amazon and you like the KS policies. There's also Createspace for paperback. Finally, I had Draft2Digital recommended tto me by a few folks prior to my release. They're apparently quite user friendly as they auto format for you. You just provide the manuscript.  If you self-pub, I HIGHLY recommend getting an editor. The folks aat www.rockandhillstudio.com are pretty cool and they specifically want to work with indie folks. They offer comprehensive service and, most importantly, payment options. And again, you want a real editor. You might think you can edit it all yourself but you cannot.  Hope that helps!"

There are mighty cities on Yuggoth—great tiers of terraced towers built of black stone... The sun shines there no brighter than a star, but the beings need no light. They have other subtler senses, and put no windows in their great houses and temples... The black rivers of pitch that flow under those mysterious cyclopean bridges—things built by some elder race extinct and forgotten before the beings came to Yuggoth from the ultimate voids—ought to be enough to make any man a Dante or Poe if he can keep sane long enough to tell what he has seen... —H.

If you want something a little closer to Lovecraft, try Dagon, directed by Stuart Gorden. It's really a modern Era adaptation of Shadow Over Innsmouth, but it's fun and tense."

Lovecraft,39ta7w,Earthpig_Johnson,2,Mon Jun 15 12:09:06 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, Earthpig, though I disagree. I'm a huge fan of John Carpenter, but I feel like Prince of Darkness was one of the weaker films in his portfolio. Not saying it was a bad film, just not nearly his best.  Admittedly, I'm a bit biased. I saw The Thing when I was 10 and it fucked me all up for quite awhile. Now it's my favorite movie of all time, in spite of the fact that it's a remake. The tense atmosphere, the anxiety, the ever changing monster...yeah, I love it."
Lovecraft,39ta7w,NRageTheBeast,2,Mon Jun 15 12:29:39 2015 UTC,"The Thing is certainly a masterpiece. I'm a life-long Carpenter fan too, my older brother always did a good job of showing me the cool stuff from an early age.  I think the reason I appreciate Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness so much is that I only saw them once I hit my late teens, when I was fairly certain there weren't any more quality Carpenter films to check out.  There's just certain images in Prince of Darkness that I find highly effective, and I'm a sucker for semi-biblical horror movies that manage to put a new spin on things. Plus, it was like a ragtag group of Carpenter side characters as the leads, rather than Jamie Lee Curtis or Kurt Russell again, which helped change it up."
Lovecraft,39ta7w,Earthpig_Johnson,2,Mon Jun 15 12:35:48 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't see In the Mouth Of Madness until I was 24, during a marathon of movies I wouldn't have appreciated as much if I had seen them as a teen. This included The Shining and A Clockwork Orange.  I, too, enjoy pseudo-religious horror. I also admit it's been a long time since I saw Prince of Darkness, and it was only the once. I had been underwhelmed at the time, but I suppose I may as well give it another chance.  Jeez, this is, like, the friendliest argument ever."
Lovecraft,39ta7w,Cern_Stormrunner,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:06:29 2015 UTC,"That sounds like an incredible marathon of movies! Crazy to me that you didn't see them til your twenties, but again, my brother got me started on stuff early, so I was into The Shining and A Clockwork Orange in my teens. If you're a reader, I highly suggest reading both of those books. The Shining is far different from what Kubrick filmed, and Clockwork had, in my opinion, a better ending. Still fantastic movies, though.  I definitely recommend giving Prince of Darkness another chance. I can see being put-off by it since it is a little more of a slow burn than most Carpenter films.  And I love having friendly arguments! Civility is important, especially when it's merely an argument of opinions."

The Dunwich Horror is also interesting, but the suspense and the ""out of this world"" nature of the colour just makes it classic Lovecraft."

Being raised to believe he's the cream stock of society, and then being forced into poverty after the death of the only real male figure in his life... I'm not going to try and justify his racism, but I can see what caused the resentment and bitterness that birthed it.   On the upside, he became noticeably less racist as he got older. One of his letters even says something along the lines of ""Holy shit I was a dumbfuck. I mean, Horror at Red Hook? WHAT was I thinking!?"""
Lovecraft,39snf8,SquidsStoleMyFace,3,Mon Jun 15 05:04:46 2015 UTC,one of the saddest things in the world is that HPL suffered a lot during his life. I read somewhere that his aunt didn't like Sonia Greene and they wanted him to forsake her (one of his aunt told Sonia to not have kids with him because they should. It's a weird thing to say). HPL had a lots of friends and he suffered one of them died. He became extremely depressed when Robert E. Howard killed himself.

Howard killed himself   It's very sad and something similar happened to the third great of Weird Tales, Clark Ashton Smith. He lost both his parents and his friends in just a period of 3 years which is believed to have exhausted him greatly and contributed to his withdrawal from fiction writing."

Lovecraft,39rwsi,ferocity562,54,Sun Jun 14 04:22:04 2015 UTC,"I think it may have something to do with the fact that cthulu, a creature so powerful that you would be driven insane just by looking at it, is just a high priest for something so much more awe-inspiring. It gives the reader a real sense of scale to the whole mythos. Something that we worship (or fear) because of its power worships (or fears) something else in exactly the same way. Cthulu is beyond comprehension but there are things beyond comprehension even to cthulu."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,calrebsofgix,28,Sun Jun 14 04:37:22 2015 UTC,Interesting. I assumed that it was because Cthulhu had a fairly clear description while the other Ancient Ones (may be the wrong technical term) weren't as easy to visualise. Where is the reference to Cthulhu being a high priest? I don't recall seeing that in any of the stories that I've read (but it sounds scary).
Lovecraft,39rwsi,imcdowall,8,Sun Jun 14 11:35:58 2015 UTC,Never consciously connected that. This is the first time I've ever been scared by Lovecraft stuff.
Lovecraft,39rwsi,Tzun,50,Sun Jun 14 06:07:31 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly The Call of Cthulhu was one of the more prominent writings of Lovecraft around the era. He was not much regarded in his fictions when he was writing for science fiction magazines. However, he slowly grew in popularity, and I believe that throwing Cthulhu into the fold really boosted that."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,JustZisGuy,25,Sun Jun 14 04:06:17 2015 UTC,"For people ""of a certain age"", there's also the role-playing game Call of Cthulhu by Chaosium, which may have been their first intro to the mythos."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,domaubr,9,Sun Jun 14 06:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the RPG played some role in Cthulhu popularity, just because of the name. It also spawned several video games ('Shadow of the Comet', 'Alone in the Dark') that were quite popular in the 90s.   Even if you did not play RPG at that time, CoC was known to be quite special among the various RPGs available at that time because of the sanity rolls, almost certain death and of course its very specific lore. I know that a lot of lovecraftian readers around me were introduced to HPL works via the knowledge of the RPG and it was the case for me, even though I never played the RPG. It was the 'seed' a few decades ago of the current obsession, even if today people may not see the connection to the game.  Maybe the real question is why the RPG is called 'Call of Cthulhu' ?"
Lovecraft,39rwsi,TokyoBayRay,10,Sun Jun 14 06:54:47 2015 UTC,"I think the RPG is ultimately called Call of Cthulhu because, of the Lovecraft titles, it's catchy and feels like an RPG name. The actual game places little emphasis on Cthulhu over the other gods - they're all written up as enemies (somewhat optimistically, as the average CoC adventurer has trouble dealing with a fierce dog, let alone Yog-Sothoth), the adventure in the book is a regular haunted house, and the most famous supplements are The Mask of Nyarlathotep and Beyond the Mountains of Madness."

The rest like Yog Sothoth are all non Euclidean and constantly shifting form. They're all eldritch abominations so they end up being drawn like blobs of flesh and eyes and mouths. Cthulhu has a definite shape. A very distinctive shape, too."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,Berberberber,3,Sun Jun 14 09:06:27 2015 UTC,"Most of Lovecraft's stories in the first person are unreliable narrators, too, so descriptions tend to be a lot like that of Wilbur Whateley's brother. ""The Call of Cthulhu"" represents a series of investigations by men made of sterner stuff, so the descriptions are more dispassionate and sober-minded."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,RamseyCampbell,15,Tue Jun 23 15:06:11 2015 UTC,"Very possibly it began with August Derleth, who insisted on referring to the Cthulhu Mythos (see our correspondence)."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,Travern,9,Sun Jun 14 09:49:14 2015 UTC,"To be fair to Derleth's publishing instincts, Lovecraft's own term, ""Yog-Sothothery"", was a bit too tongue-in-cheek for titling fiction anthologies."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,RamseyCampbell,8,Sun Jun 14 13:47:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, but when I referred to the Lovecraft Mythos, August told me firmly that it was called the Cthulhu Mythos."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,Travern,4,Tue Jun 16 11:28:53 2015 UTC,"Well then, that's less re-branding than outright obfuscation.  Maybe HPL's other term, the ""Arkham Cycle"", would have been acceptable."

Lovecraft Historical Society's ""Shoggoth on the Roof"", or Neil Gaiman's ""I, Cthulhu, or, What’s A Tentacle-Faced Thing Like Me Doing In A Sunken City Like This (Latitude 47° 9’ S, Longitude 126° 43’ W)?"".)"
Lovecraft,39rwsi,SquidsStoleMyFace,13,Tue Jun 16 14:07:31 2015 UTC,I guess cause he's the easiest one to neuter into cute little knick knacks. His appearance is pretty consistent and recognizeable even to those not really into the mythos.  Personally I'd kill for more Nyarlothotep merch.

Pretty much everything else is weird tentacles and feelers and slime and mucous and indescribable non euclidean forms while Cthulhu, weirdly, is the most approachable. He's also kind of the one with the clearest “goal“: drive everyone insane and eat them."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,PhyrexianDildo,8,Sun Jun 14 12:45:49 2015 UTC,"The popularity Cthulhu and name of the Cthulhu Mythos was a product of August Derleth and Arkham House. Lovecraft refered to his semi connected works as the Yog-Sothoth Cycle. Derleth collected Lovecrafts works after his death and attributed more significance to Cthulhu than Lovecraft ever intended in order to capitalize on his own derivative works involving Lovecraft's bestiary and cosmology.   Derleth also popularized the idea of the elder/outer gods having evil intent due to his own Christian beliefs as well as assigning an elemental (as in the four classical elements) significance to some of them. HP being an atheist and materialist never attributed any morality or spiritual significance to his creatures and universe. The eldritch beings populating his world were hyper-powerful and intelligent alien beings in origin with motivations beyond our comprehension and the ""magic"" is nothing supernatural but an infinitely obtuse and incomprehensible form of alien mathematics and physics. Lovecraftian magic isn't incantations but more like having 2+2=5 and it making sense. It's why consistent exposure to it leads to madness. The mind can only take so much paradox."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,pauldrye,5,Sun Jun 14 18:22:04 2015 UTC,"Where did it start? Sometime after Lovecraft's death, when his body of work was dubbed ""The Cthulhu Mythos"" by August Derleth.  Derleth had a peculiar take on Lovecraft. Most notably, he felt the need to organize the mythos entities into a pantheon of evil gods based on the four classic elements (and oppose it with a good pantheon). Cthulhu was promoted to the ""Water God"" position and became more prominent.  That stuck when the mass-market breakthrough of Lovecraft's work came with the Del Rey editions in the 80s. Most of Derleth's other innovations are forgotten, but that and Ithaqua the Wind-Walker made the grade."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,deviger,5,Sun Jun 14 16:40:31 2015 UTC,"Lovecraft himself didn't hold the story in high regard. In one of the Lovecraft scholar, S.T. Joshi's books, he stated that Lovecraft called Call ""rather middling—not as bad as the worst, but full of cheap and cumbrous touches"""
Lovecraft,39rwsi,EclecticallySound,2,Sun Jun 14 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"I think its because the most publicised in pop culture. When people say, 'Who is this Lovecraft or Cthulhu' - most of the time their is a generalised quick explanation that sounds something like. 'he wrote about a series of gods, its horror, its good.'   That is just in my opinion and experience."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,SoulFire6464,2,Sun Jun 14 17:24:56 2015 UTC,Because he's got a fucking tentacle face. Who doesn't love that?
Lovecraft,39rwsi,TenaciousDwight,2,Mon Jun 15 00:40:44 2015 UTC,For me it was because of Metallica's 'call of ktulu'.
Lovecraft,39rwsi,gonzohistory,2,Mon Jun 15 01:02:39 2015 UTC,"I think most people have got it right -- Derleth, then the game. I think it's very hard to overestimate the role the CoC RPG played in popularising Cthulhu in geek culture, even among people who have never read any Lovecraft.   It's also the case that ""The Call of Cthulhu"" is a good type story for that category of Lovecraft fiction -- it's got a lot of the elements you find in other ""mythos"" stories, like the sense of deep time, the alien beings worshipped as gods, the hints of weird science and so on, and all in a very manageable length.   It's also got that spectacular opening."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,paperfisherman,2,Mon Jun 15 09:43:20 2015 UTC,"Because he's the most unique-looking one, and damn scary.  But also I think the reason Cthulhu is so memorable is because he's essentially a representation of all of humanity's existential angst.  When he awakens from his sleep, the world is doomed, and his presence on earth causes all of humanity to have that deep, ambiguous fear.  Cthulhu is the face of humanity's fear of death, the end of the world, etc.  Even though he's just a high priest and not the most powerful god in the mythos, that makes him incredibly scary."
Lovecraft,39rwsi,KicksButtson,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"To me the obsession with Cthulhu specially rather than any of the other arguably more powerful entities of the Lovecraft universe is because Cthulhu is one of the only massive ancient entities present on Earth. It may be scary to think about unstoppable cosmic horrors which make your entire civilization feel inadequate, but having an unstoppable threat closer to home makes for a better story."

If you go deep in the Mythos you will soon realize that most of the deities that you encounter are hard to describe into a physical plain of existence, therefore hard to create a t-shirt based on. For example, it would be extremely hard for one to create a shirt based on some colors coming out of a well, and basing a fan base around it."

Lovecraft,39otuz,svartsomsilver,11,Sat Jun 13 14:34:06 2015 UTC,"That means it's designed with VR in mind - good optimization for the rift, requiring a larger FOV than you would normally have with a monitor, etc. The only major game I can think of off the top of my head that is going to be rift exclusive is Eve: Valkyrie, which is going to be a space dogfighting game.  But back to the topic of the rift in general, it's not for consoles, it's going to be a PC peripheral, and it's actually not available to the general public yet - they just announced the final version and specs a few days ago actually. Developer versions have been around for a year or two, going through a few iterations, so people can get used to the technology and iron the kinks out (mainly preventing motion sickness/disorientation and increasing immersion). Originally it was a kickstarter project, so if you were one of the original backers and spent I want to say 250 or 300, you'd get a developer kit. One of my friends has one and it's a crazy experience to use, even if the game you're playing isn't optimized for it. Playing first person shooters with it feels like cheating, since you just look where you want to aim instead of using the mouse, and it is an insanely immersive experience for space sims like Star Citizen.  Edit: Words"

Lovecraft,39otuz,sheriff_gingerbeard,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:44:33 2015 UTC,The problem with including things that you can't fail at is that more things can be defined as games than what most people would include. How would you define a game?
Lovecraft,39otuz,bagboyrebel,3,Sun Jun 14 00:06:13 2015 UTC,"I dunno, but there have been a lot of attempts to do so, and I pretty much never see any include a fail state. That idea was entirely fabricated by a certain recent movement that wants to redefine games to exclude those they don't like because they challenge the mainstream idea of what games can or should be.  After all, I never see anyone claim Journey isn't a game, and if I recall, that doesn't have any ""fail state"" either."
Lovecraft,39otuz,sheriff_gingerbeard,2,Sun Jun 14 23:30:42 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I've played, but I remember Journey having sections that you could fail and have to start over.  I personally feel like if there's no fail state it shouldn't be considered a game. Now what constitutes a fail state might still be up for some debate. I guess a better way to phrase it is that I believe a game has to have some challenge to overcome, and without a fail state then it was never really a challenge to begin with."
Lovecraft,39otuz,bagboyrebel,2,Sun Jun 14 23:46:50 2015 UTC,"But then, is a game where you can die but immediately respawn not a game? Is simple exploration and uncovering solutions/narrative through exploration not overcoming a set of challenges? Again, I don't think there are any people defining what games are (beyond low-level bloggers) who claim it must include a fail state. Check out the article I linked to. Even Wikipedia doesn't seem to have any. The notion of a game requiring a fail state is a recent invention, and it was made specifically to exclude certain games that subsets of modern gamers have wanted to push out of the community, like Gone Home. It's entirely a political maneuver with nothing to really back it.  I mean, you can consider a game to be whatever you want. You can say a game must include tap dancing. But in terms of the on-going serious discourse on the matter, this fail state business is pretty much fabricated."
Lovecraft,39otuz,sheriff_gingerbeard,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:48:09 2015 UTC,You're the only one making anything political. You're also the one assuming that not considering something a game is inherently bad. I played Gone Home and really liked it. I would not consider it a game though. There are no choices to make at any point. It has more in common with a Disney Land ride than a game.
Lovecraft,39otuz,bagboyrebel,2,Mon Jun 15 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"I'm just recognizing where the idea generated from and what its intent was. And saying something isn't a game when it is, even if you qualify that it's totally okay, still has a whole host of issues that go with it. It's like saying, ""No games can be art. I'm not saying that's bad, just that games aren't art."" You're still making this in-group-out-group thing that can cause a lot of problems, especially in the situation of video games, which is a hotbed of definitions right now.  That being said, as much as this is buried in a comment that will be hidden for most people (the original I responded to), it is veering way off topic. If you want to continue the conversation in public or PM, I'm down. But, well, there it is."

Lovecraft,395zvy,Eldresh,32,Tue Jun 9 14:33:33 2015 UTC,"I will never again unwrap another present and I plead that we immediately end this unspeakable practice of wrapped gifts.  No, Doctor, I am not mad, or at least no madder than the universe from which emerged the seemingly-empty frozen tundra of the uncharted northern Canadian interior.  I know that once you know what I now know, you will agree.  It happened on a Yuletide evening.  I was sitting across from the fire, enjoying the flame-silhouetted form of my cherished cat, Inferior Polack Trash, named for his brutish appearance and dull wit.  Suddenly the flames licked out of the fireplace from a freakish blast of cold air that had blown down the chimney. Inferior Polack Trash hissed and then crystals of frost appeared all over his coat, and he froze solid as an eldritch granite statue of Bast.  ""HO,"" called a hollow voice from above.  Terrified, I fled into the cellar and barred the trap door.  ""HO,"" it repeated, and I heard heavy boots stomping about on the floorboards, just inches above my head. For several minutes, something performed indescribable activities, punctuated by ""HO""s, all sounding both distant and near at the same time.  Eventually the sounds stopped, and after an hour of silence, I braved to venture out of the cellar.  All about the room, were scattered numerous cardboard boxes, each wrapped in garish colored paper, but unlabeled and giving no clues as to their contents.  Inferior Polack Trash was nowhere to be seen, but then I heard a maiow.  It seemed to be coming from one of the boxes.  I picked it up and held it to my ear, but then I heard another maiow coming from another box.  Then began a mad chorus of maiows, all clearly in the voice of my beloved pet, coming from each box.  I fainted, of course, and do not remember the twelve days after that, until I awoke here at the sanitarium. Doctor, if I am not to be released, then I beg you to go to my house and burn all the boxes unopened!"

Stories of mine that directly reference the Cthulhu Mythos: ""Hour of the Cyclops,"" ""Vastation,"" ""Fear Sun"" and a novella I'm working on now. This last, incidentally, touches on Azathoth. I'm influenced by Lovecraft, among others, but in general my work bears no direct relation to the Mythos.  Thanks,  L   P.S.: HaloManash, you are correct. ""Shiva..."" is largely devoid of a plot.

Being one of Barron's first ever stories (at least published), it is also fun to try and see the connections between it and others.

Lovecraft,38od9s,therealemperordalek,9,Fri Jun 5 15:00:13 2015 UTC,"My post on this first issue did not get much conversation going, but I'll post it here for anyone looking for a slightly more in depth and less wholly positive opinion:  CONTEXT  I just finished the first issue  (of twelve) of Alan Moore's comic book series, Providence. The hype has been pretty substantial, both because of Alan Moore's notoriety as a storyteller, and for his previous Lovecraftian tales, The Courtyard and Neonomicon. Avatar Press, the publisher, has pumped it up quite a bit:  >In his most carefully considered work in decades, Moore deconstructs all of Lovecraft’s concepts, reinventing the entirety of his work inside a painstakingly researched framework of American history.  They also claim it will be the Watchmen of horror, which is a bold claim. Personally, I am not too huge a fan of Moore, finding him to be far too self-congratulatory and condescending. Further, he has this sense of ""edginess"" that blew up in the '80s and '90s that has a lot in common with the mindlessness of ""dark and gritty"" reboots we're experiencing now. Neonomicon emphasized to me Moore's obsession with shock value, namely one that exploits female characters (The Killing Joke, anyone?). I don't think Moore said anything new there in terms of Lovecraft, so I held reservations about this book.  Obviously, one twelfth of the story does not justify a lengthy review, but it does allow for some discussion. For me, I was surprised that the main character is merely a Lovecraft cipher, as the way it'd been described seemed to imply to me (incorrectly) that Lovecraft would be the protagonist. Instead, we're having a new character, one who is gay, which is interesting in light of Lovecraft's distaste for the subject (see here). He is also a journalist working for the New York Herald, and meets with a Dr. Alverez, who is clearly an adaptation of Dr. Muñoz from ""Cool Air."".  SUMMARY  Thus far, not much has happened.  SPOILERS We learn that protagonist Robert Black is working a a journalist and needs to find a story to fill half a page for the New York Herald. He interviews Dr. Alvarez about Sous le monde and The King in Yellow, books that allegedly drove readers to suicide or insanity. Alvarez explains that it was likely just marketing, but that the stories themselves reflect interesting qualities of ourselves, namely the distinction between human behavior in society, and human behavior away from society. Black realizes he has no story, but is intrigued by Alvarez, and might talk to him further. However, he's dismayed to learn of the suicide of a man with whom he'd just broke off an affair. This is about all we get from this issue.  ANALYSIS  The themes thus far are merely small strings that could lead to interesting places, or just see Moore returning to a pseudo-metafictional deconstruction of a popular image—this time with ol' H.P. Lovecraft rather than superheroes. The first major theme is the attempt to find reality through or within a text, ""text"" meaning any piece of media, but particularly fiction. In the first page, we see an excerpt from one of Black's letters to Jonathan, in which he says, ""You seemed to break through the mere words to the reality lying beyond them."" The next two panels show Jonathan rip the pages, which fill the panel, to reveal the city of New York underneath. Moore invites us to look at and past the words in order to better see our own world, to understand our reality through our fiction. In essence, he's asking us to look at this text and see not just a story, but it's implications for the author(s) that Black clearly replicates (I note the ""s"" because the name is clearly a reference to H.P.L.'s correspondent and later famous author, ""Robert Bloch""). To me, this feels like Moore telling us that we need to pay attention to how important his story is, without giving us any real reason to. It's like a teenager who demands you recognize how deep and complicated they are just because they say they're deep and complicated.  The other major idea is the one put forth by Dr. Alvarez: there is a ""secret society"" that exists behind closed doors. He says, ""I have my secret and you have yours, I think. Other people, also. There is a concealed country, therefore, hidden below the society we show the world. Uncomfortable truth, it lurks behind our pretences (sic)."" I like to think this is just a general observation that there is a world beneath our own that we all experience, which is in many ways the basis of all horror. This secret that is inextricably and necessarily a part of our lives, but one that we do not wish to confront. However, I expect that Moore is in many ways indicating his intent: to reveal what Lovecraft fans try so steadfastly to ignore. Lovecraft's racism, misogyny, and generally conservative viewpoints are well-known. However, readers tend to write them off as simply normal for the time period, and many more will say that it is hardly a formative component to his writings. Say what you want about that, but I think Moore intends to reveal just how part and parcel the prejudices—a topic that discussions of Lovecraft carefully leave behind closed doors—are to nature of the horror and our interest.  CONCLUSION  I am wont to read into what I anticipate as cynicism, because I find Moore's work to be too conceited and pessimistic. That is subjective and influences my reading. However, I think there's a lot of open potential, which means that Moore can use these idea germs and build them into something thoughtful. Moore does not start out as strong as he could here, leaving the first issue a bit lacking on its own, but it could lead to something quite new for Lovecraftian media.  Anyway, now that I've blabbed, feel free to comment on any of this or share your thoughts."

Lovecraft,38od9s,megagoosey,-1,Sat Jun 6 04:55:14 2015 UTC,"I think many of those are derivitive or alternative for the very sake of being alternative. The Watchmen for instance, its a fairly standard comic/writing arc but the idea is ""Not superheroes"" and they're ""real"". Thats where it ends for me, never got into the characters, the story or the attempt at mythos.  This is just to illustrate that we have differing opinions on what is good, therefore this argument can never be settled as obviously some people love him, some people dont. The quote from him on the cover of the Australia published Watchmen collection calling it the most important work in comics is where I began to dislike him."
Lovecraft,38od9s,LintonJoe,8,Sat Jun 6 05:01:55 2015 UTC,"If Watchmen feels ""fairly standard,"" it's because it's been so heavily emulated. There was nothing like that book before it came out. Watchmen wasn't just about being ""alternative"" or ""real,"" it was about taking a medium that had been dealing in nothing but black and white and exploring the gray. The villain isn't necessarily a villain to everyone, but his character forces you to consider the question of whether it's ever ethical to do a bad thing for a good reason. And then Doctor Manhattan's character forces you to consider whether it all even matters at all, really. The ending lets you decide how you think the public will handle the truth - will they embrace it and want to know more, or will they dismiss it as crazy ramblings because it's hard to swallow? Watchmen stripped away the shine from comics and completely changed the way people thought about them. I've never seen him say that Watchmen is the most important work in comics, but it's probably true. That's not to say that there weren't great comics before Watchmen (obviously there were), but it is a landmark book that changed the landscape of comics in a way that no other book ever had before, and no book has since.   You're right about people having differing opinions - neither of us are about to change the other's minds about anything - but to me, Moore is one of the few extremely hyped authors who I think deserves every bit of the attention he's gotten. He's done everything from nasty crime comics (From Hell), to light hearted, sincere, relatively straightforward comics (Tom Strong, Top 10, Smax), to incredibly well crafted mainstream canon stuff (Superman, Batman, etc), to way out there original work (V for Vendetta), to insane metafiction stories that combine Captain Nemo and the Invisible Man with War of the Worlds (League of Extraordinary Gentleman), to deconstructionist superhero books (Watchmen, Supreme).  I love comics and read all types, but I can't place Moore anywhere but the very top of the hierarchy of my favorites. That doesn't mean I'm necessarily all that interested in meeting the guy, but to me, his talent is undeniable."
Lovecraft,38od9s,nationalmaverick,2,Sat Jun 6 05:32:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly - Watchmen was anything but ""fairly standard"" in the 80s when it appeared... and it's still head and shoulders above 95% of superhero comics. It stands up to repeated readings, unlike most of the ""standard"" comics at that time and most since."
Lovecraft,38od9s,quantum_metaphysics,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:46:04 2015 UTC,"I give him credit for bringing to comics the type of stories that has been in mainstream paperback writing for a very long time. He's not cutting new ground in story telling and thats my problem, people give him credit for things done in novels for a long, long time.  Like I said, there are a few of his works which I love, but others that got way more attention then they deserve for their ""edge"" and ""story telling"".  Its not unlike the current fascination with Game of Thrones, a middle of the road author (at best) got a TV deal, the TV show has spent a lot of time and effort cleaning up his work and making it much, much better and now he's getting credit for this image of incredible story telling and edginess but anyone who's read more then three books knows that he's rehashing better work and adding in murder and rape to make it feel edgy and fresh."
Lovecraft,38od9s,sheriff_gingerbeard,4,Sat Jun 6 06:45:28 2015 UTC,"I think that's being a little harsh; I think Moore was genuinely trying to use sex and rape as both commentary on Lovecraft as well as an exploration of Lovecratian horror in its own right. That being said, while I'd say I enjoyed Neonomicon (to the extent that that word could appropriately be used to describe ones feelings towards the book), I would agree that it failed as a truly Lovecraftian story.  Still, if Providence is to Lovecraft what Watchmen is to superheroes or League is to Victorian and British fiction, I'm excited to see where things go."
Lovecraft,38od9s,quantum_metaphysics,3,Fri Jun 5 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"You seem to have a pretty nuanced opinion on the matter, so would you mind if I asked you to expand on this a bit? Specifically:   I think Moore was genuinely trying to use sex and rape as both commentary on Lovecraft as well as an exploration of Lovecratian horror in its own right.   I know Moore himself spoke of how he saw Lovecraft's squeamishness when dealing with sex in his stories, and decided to make explicit what was previously only implicit. To me, that didn't really justify its inclusion. It's one thing to comment and critique or elaborate on something, but just putting a detail at center stage without any greater point is at best misguided. And in my mind, that's all Moore did. But I'd love to have a back-and-forth on it, if you're willing. :)"
Lovecraft,38od9s,sheriff_gingerbeard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:25:14 2015 UTC,"You give me too much credit! I really didn't have much more to say beyond that. I do think he was trying genuinely, because much of his prior work I believe has succeeded at deconstructing various issues and so I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I agree that in Neonomicon he failed to do so. Nonetheless, I thought it was an interesting read that, if nothing else, succeeded at being shocking and uncomfortable."
Lovecraft,38od9s,Voduar,-5,Sun Jun 7 02:06:40 2015 UTC,"triggered Its not pointless at all, its hugely thematic to the work!"
Lovecraft,38od9s,Word-slinger,5,Fri Jun 5 20:45:57 2015 UTC,"The fact that you're making a joke about a term used by victims of sexual assault is pretty telling.  Something can be hugely thematic to the work while still being lazy. And I think that Moore was very out of touch with issues on sexual assault and decided to incorporate it into his work anyway, because it's shocking. It's hard not to read Neonomicon and feel that that scene is exploitative, reducing the main character to a victim of a scenario in which she not only is disempowered, but (in my opinion completely unrealistically, both in terms of the realities of sexual assault and in terms of that character) then jokes around with the monster who is raping her, eventually welcoming his child into her body because...er...Lovecraftian monsters make people craaaazy!  I'm sure there is more to the text as a whole, but it was hard for me to get past that truly awful centerpiece.  I respect your different point of view, and obviously I don't think my reading is the exclusively correct one. But I think contextualizing this point in the oh-so-Reddit fashion of minimizing a complicated issue into an italicized joke does not contribute to the conversation, and therefore do I downvote."

And I think that Moore was very out of touch with issues on sexual assault and decided to incorporate it into his work anyway, because it's shocking.    I've been saying this about Game of Thrones for two years now. Concerningly, I think this suggests that some folks have a horrifying empathy gap when it comes to this."
Lovecraft,38od9s,T-S-Erik,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:06:02 2015 UTC,"From the review:   ...the ever so slight sense of menace pervading the entire first issue, one that increases the more we become aware that this miniseries is set in Lovecraft’s universe.   So, I'm guessing ""no."""
Lovecraft,38r0yv,callmebrotherg,2,Sat Jun 6 02:07:16 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I've said much the same thing as Ms Peake did.
