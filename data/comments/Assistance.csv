Basically, any other alternative is better. It is worse than throwing money away. You are enabling these predatory businesses to stay in business and cheat other people out of their money.   Second, post a little more detail of your financial situation to /r/personalfinance. The people there can offer some excellent advise for digging yourself out of a financial hole.   Third, if you are in need of basic necessities (food, shelter, transportation, etc), post here and usually someone can help you out.

Assistance,3e3qqe,Pudmeister,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, people who do this sort of thing aren't necessarily in a bad spot. What stores often throw out are perfectly good items that can no longer be sold because they've passed that sell before date only because it has to be removed from the shelves for two reasons: A) make room for the new stock of items in order to keep a constant supply of products on a shelf/rack, B) the dates are only a guideline that tells a store that X item must be sold or removed from the shelves before X date so that certain food items are sold long before they reach this date in order for the item to still be consumable long before their actual expiration. It wouldn't do any store any good if food stuffs had actual expiration dates on them. Imaging if you purchased a loaf of bread only a day before it expires and you only had one day left to consume it before it actually began going bad.  The dates printed on most packages are just estimates. Most food items are perfectly fine even a week after having passed this date if they are stored properly. There are a lot of items that are perfectly fine to consume being thrown out, even clothing, electronics, toys and many other products.  I understand that it's not exaclty seen well in the eyes of our current society, but that's only because they were taught that this was a bad thing. That's why there's so much waste. If stores were to give away the food they're otherwise throwing out, we'd not only be able to feed the poor, but very likely abolish famine. The only two reasons stores don't do this is because it costs money to package and transport this food to locations where it can be given away and becaus it's being given away more people will likely go that route rather than spend money, unless they implement policies to avoid that.  Anyway, just saying."

I'm so sorry that you're going through this, but please know, that shame that you may feel, is not something that should stop you from getting real assistance.    Can your wife apply for unemployment?  Can you list all of your expenses and head over to /r/personalfinance and ask for help with budgeting for the next coming months, and how to deal with your overdue bills? I'd also check out /r/Frugal and /r/EatCheapAndHealthy  I would look up a food bank in your area (this is what they exist for) and get some food on your table, also check out /r/Food_Bank  In the meantime can your wife look into applying for a temp agency, or taking a job below her last pay? You could look at the gigs section, especially childcare, if she is willing, on Craigslist.  Could your daughters look into babysitting or getting minimum wage jobs as well? I'm not sure how old they are, but are they in high school?   I think if you also listed off each bill and the amount in your GoFundMe or here, people might be willing to pay off one or two individually or contact the company themselves and pay it on your behalf.

One that most employees cannot answer with 100% certainty. It pretty much comes down to this:   If he's put on a coaster with a lap rail and the coaster brakes/ goes down an incline is he going to be able to remain upright without help? Or is he going to fall forward and possibly hurt himself? Can he get on and off a ride with your assistance? Ride operators can help a bit with fastening belts etc , but can't lift someone (OHS). If he has a shoulder restraint on but can't 'grip' the handles, are his arms going to move about and hurt him/ others.   And in an emergency situation how is he going to get off a ride?  It's really a case by case and ride by ride situation. Have a discussion with him, he will know his limitations and what he feels comfortable with. Also he is the only one that will be able to tell you how upsetting it would be for him if he was unable to ride.  I'm sure there will be some things he can ride and some things he can't, but maybe a day out at a theme park is still enjoyable for him even if he can't go on all the big roller coasters."

I made it over the hurdle.  In your field you should know that a ~16 year habit of benzodiazepine cross addicted with alcohol can lead to months to years of slowly carefully tapering off to prevent mental issues and even death.   1 week of detox does not do it.  The second i walked out of detox i bought more (legally) not because I wanted to get high (it doesnt get me high it shuts my mind up and kills my anxiety and allows me to sleep)  The reason i bought more was because my bp was stage 2. forget exact figures but was 155/98 or so.  And i felt like i was going to die and was tripping and losing balance and kept having to sit down.  You must not be from the south.  We dont really care about poor or sick people here.  Everyone there but me was trying to re up on their methadone or valium so they could get back on the street full of nutrition and get back on h or alcohol.  I was the only one trying my best to do it right, and it STILL FAILED.  i did 90 hours of aa in 90 days. ive spent almost a  year of my life incarcerated and face more.  I know if i touch a drink i wont stop until im in jail or dead.  And if i recall correctly i mentioned i was TAPERING, not cold turkey cus thats just stupid.  I tapered too quick, regardless i doubt it was a seizure. i think it was the basketball hookshot that i was trying to help my heart out with and take my mind off the benzos.  But very few view addiction as a mental genetic illness and more of a daily choice and losers make, so they lack empathy and consider them subhuman, i would draw a comparison to hitlers thoughts towards jews that is very accurate ( he killed addicts too as well as stalin) but the side of the fence that believes that we make poor choices and have to live with our bad decisins will never get my side of the argument.  Ive suffered the consequences. for the final time, this is NOT ABOUT MY ADDICTION. you can find me in #stopdrinking and #anxiety 24/7 on IRC. thats where i talk to people who have been through it and recovered and i discuss that. I came here for medical advice and possible help, that was all.

Try using a resume template from MS Word (or something similar) and personalizing it a bit. I'm not too knowledgeable about corporate resumes, but some standards still apply: you want your resume to stand out from the bunch, and go on to be concise and easy to read very quickly. If an employer sees a giant wall of unformatted text, that'll be a NOPE. Fit in some action/power verbs (google search will help with this) and quantify your accomplishments. Use numbers wherever you can. Lastly, although it can be a pain, you may find it helpful to refine your resume each time you send it out so that the content matches the position you are applying for. I'm not sure about your state, but most areas offer assistance with resume writing, like your local workforce center and possibly even a temp agency. Again, I would recommend a quick google search for your area. I'm on mobile right now so my hands are a bit tied. Good luck!!"

If you rent it out, you are still responsible for the structure. You can get a rental policy from your insurance agent. The tenant is only responsible for his/her own things inside the house.  If the house is empty, insurance rate is higher, but it absolutely can still be insured. There are also people who will live in/clean/fix up a place for you either for a small fee or for free (depending on the situation). I see them on Craigslist all the time.  Different insurance companies have different requirements, which means they will write different policies.

As far as cremation vs. burial, I was very close to my cat (I would call him my soulmate) and I wanted to keep him with me, so I had him cremated. I might bury his urn someday, but for now he is with me on his own special shelf surrounded by his belongings. I feel comforted knowing he is there, and I think that's where he'd want to be. I also like the symbolism and finality of cremation. So whether you go with cremation or burial, you can still have her with you at your property.  I'm truly sorry you're going through this.

I think sharing your concerns with your wife, and ultimately having input from your children, if they are old enough, will help you make the best choices for your dog. Again, so very sorry."

This will assist with pain numbing until you can find some other solution. I just apply it directly to the pain area. It burns for a minute then numbs out.  It's the base in most dental numbing solutions, and the full-strength/natural stuff works much better for intense pain - you may need to dilute it at first, though, to check for allergic reaction.   If you can only get the ones that use it as a base, though, they'll still help at least temporarily (and being in a paste base helps them stay put, of course)."

It's like there's something missing.  On the porfolio page, have her keep all the images the same size. It looks weird when one of them is a different height.  The Timeline page (Design Process) is just way too long. It took me a while to figure out what all those rows were for, and then I had to scroll forever to actually see everything because of the huge gaps between rows.  The blog is pretty cluttered.  It looks like she's running a Wordpress site, so I'd tell her to try to either find a different template or modify the one she's using to get rid of all that whitespace. I'm just not loving the design at all and find it very distracting.  Since she's selling her design services to people she'll want to make sure her site design is excellent or people will make the mistaken assumption that because the site design is bad her interior design must be equally bad. That's not a fair assumption, but don't give potential customers the option of making that unfair assumption.    Here are a few things in terms of content/copy   She needs some better page titles. At a minimum she should put WHERE she offers her services in both page title and somewhere obvious on the main page.  She should move the ""Services Provided"" out of the ""Connect"" menu and somewhere else. It's not obvious to look there, and the services she provides are how she makes money. I'd honestly make that a top-level menu item right next to Home.  Finally, I'd suggest something about price. If I'm a homeowner and I'm looking for a designer I want to know at least a baseline range. If I have $5,000 can I call her or is that absurdly low? Is the average job $25K or $100K?

As a starting point, though I think the personality in the content is great, I think it could stand to be cleaned up grammar-wise and to be written with a slightly more professional tone. (Not too much though - I would definitely want to preserve the personality in there!)  Overall, I think it could benefit from more examples/describing some of the concepts, and could definitely benefit from more ""storytelling"". It might be a good idea to tell the stories behind some of the design jobs in the portfolios? How you got the ideas, worked with the clients, what the inspiration/influence was for the space? People love to hear about others' experiences and to apply that to their own dream space.  Feel free to ask me any more questions if you have them!"

No matter what, even if the sales contract is an as is contract, if the dealer knowingly sells you a car with all these issues they by law either have to take the car back or pay for the repairs. A bad Trans mission, broken tie rod are not issues they wouldn't have known about. They knew about them but wanted to sell the car without fixing. I would write a letter of intent to sue and send it to them certified mail. Wait a reasonable amount of time for a response then I'd sue. No need to lawyer up, it's clear cut! With a letter of intent to sue give them options to make it right. Make sure to well document everything! As I tell everyone, this is the #1 reason you never buy from small or buy here pay here dealers. They get all of their cars from auctions that no one else wants!"
Assistance,3dq5dv,10220414,3,Sat Jul 18 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"That is a very ignorant statement. I have run a bhph dealerships for the past five years. Just because a car is bought at auction does not mean no one wanted it.  Often times, they are repoed vehicles. Many, many used car dealers spend thousands of dollars in repairs before the vehicle even hits the lot."
Assistance,3dq5dv,ninjabarbie79,3,Sat Jul 18 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"Its not meant to be. I worked for one of the countries largest car dealers (Carmax) for some time. I ran the auctions at carmax and I saw what kind of cars passed through (being a mechanic for carmax) and 99% of them were just plain outright JUNK! Most had bent frames or been put on a frame machine, sludge in the engine, low end engine noise, trans issues or just flat out would cost more to fix then we'd get out of the car. Now there were about 2% if that that were actually repos. Half the time repos were no better. If the person couldn't afford to make their payments you think they were able to afford to service the car. 70% of the repos that came in were trashed. We'd pay a company that hires cheap labor to go through clean them up and sell them for more. I've seen the guys coming in to buy the auction cars and they weren't of any quality either. Im just saying, there may be a few good small used dealers out there but 98% of them will do anything to sell that car to you, up to putting you into a contract that you don't understand to sell the car then repo it back from you. Buy here pay here are well known for this, they write the loans inflate the interest and fees so high that a customer defaults. They are leading to a pool called dead beat buyers and they know that about 80% of the loans will default and they will get the car back. As Im sure you're aware most if not qll install a gps tracker in the car before it leaves the lot.. Why because that day the buyer defaults on their loan more then 15 days they are coming for the car. The best part of it is that the contracts normally state, if you default the lender can request full amount owed on the loan to get the car back. So if you took a 5000K loan and with interest and fees it goes up to 6K they will demand all 6K to get your car back otherwise that sell the car in auction keep every penny you paid and walk away free and clear. Its double dipping on one car. Plus if they don't get what is owed on the loan in auction they can sue you for the rest. So in the end your stuck with that over inflated loan no matter what  hence the reason I tell people to steer clear. I don't care how bad you need a car, they buy the car at 2500 charge you 5k + interest and fees, you pay a year on it and see the principle only go down $300 and you get frustrated. The car breaks down you stop paying, they repo the car. Sell it in auction for 2K and come after you via courts for the 3500 still owed on the loan."

The apartment provided by the company didn't have any yard space I could use, but there was a little balcony that thankfully received a lot of sun.    I just put holes in any containers I could find in the office (mostly plastic boxes that were used to hold a dozen apples, ice cream tubs).  For gardening tools? A spoon, a fork, and one chopstick. All because I didn't want to invest too much money in a new hobby.   I did invest a lot of time though - watering them twice a day (early morning and late evening), removing bugs, singing happy songs on my ukulele, etc.  You really don't need a lot of space and money to plant produce - it's not about a pretty garden, but just a functional one.

No one needs 5 bags unless they are building a large garden. They could start with 1 bag and grow just a few high-yield plants. They bring it home the same way they bring groceries home... In their car, in their friends car, on the bus, or by walking it home. Heck, even Amazon have it so they could request a bag of soil instead of other wish list items. ive seen stakes for under $2 (even cheaper at the end of the season)... Or take a hike and take your choice of free branches. Finally, kids can garden. It's a great skill to have and a ""fun"" thing to do with your kids.   Maybe you need conditions to be perfect in order to dive in, but people can be resourceful. Allowing those who can and want to garden to purchase seeds using their benefits will hopefully encourage more of that resourcefulness. My parents did and do grow virtually all of their own vegetables with very little spending and produce far more than they can eat. Once the garden or plants are set up, it's minimal work that can be done even if you have a full time job.

Assistance,3donzu,whovian42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:52:06 2015 UTC,Thank you! I have my initial consultation for my fertility plan this coming Thursday. I think after the initial tests - they will tell me what will be the best for me. I am hoping it isn't straight IVF right away but the way my doctor was talking - it looked like that was the route my specialist would go. I'm hopeful though that the less expensive treatments will work - at this point I have to be hopeful for anything.   How much did you have to pay for your injections?
Assistance,3donzu,whovian42,2,Sun Jul 19 01:59:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely shop around because one doc told us it would be like 12,000 for IVF and if we had gotten there with our current one it was only like 8. Plus the first doc wanted to jump straight to IVF when there was no reason to. Injections are like $700, there's another $300 or so of blood testing and ultrasounds comes to about $1k a month. With IUI it becomes like $2k a month, with my particular doc."

Assistance,3donzu,DiagnosisImpossible,0,Sun Jul 19 01:57:24 2015 UTC,She went with injection first and that did not work.. Then she went with the IVF and they got the eggs and then when ready they implanted one and it did not take.. Then went and they did 2 and one worked and she lost the other one.. But we are so thankful for the one.. Most of the IVF Clinics will not even consider doing this unless they think it will work.. It may take more than once but they should give you all the cost upfront.. When she went the 2nd time it was not as expensive since they had allready gotten the eggs and she had 12 that they could use.. Keep me updated on your journey.. I will say we do have a beautiful baby Boy and he is perfect and really loved :)
Assistance,3donzu,DiagnosisImpossible,7,Sun Jul 19 02:04:19 2015 UTC,"My only advice as someone who was previously diagnosed as ""probably having PCOS"" and now ""definitely doesn't have PCOS"" is that if you aren't currently, get to a healthy weight range.

Assistance,3donzu,dizzyvonblue,0,Sat Jul 18 01:26:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I appreciate your advice and kind words. It is definitely a struggle to get to a ""normal"" weight with the PCOS. I've had the severe pcos for so long and have tried everything to fight it. Losing weight is definitely a struggle with it. I've tried everything. I'm 5'6"" and 220lbs (which I don't believe to be too extreme or crazy, lol) but the only time I was able to consistently lose weight is when I went on a full liquid diet. I know cutting out carbs is the best for PCOS but that alone doesn't cut it. It seems the less I eat, the better I feel but my weight is stagnate.   I saw a dietitian that kept me on a food plan for my PCOS for 6 months and that was even unsuccessful. I take daily walks with my dogs as well, so exercise is not a problem. I feel hopeless with no solution to the underlying problem that is causing my infertility."
Assistance,3donzu,whovian42,3,Sun Jul 19 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a nurse and am happy to impart whatever I can, if you'd like to hear it. If not, don't feel any obligation to continue reading.   Having PCOS does make it difficult to lose weight. Severe PCOS would mean that you have very high testosterone for a woman which would give you the facial hair, fat accumulation in the belly, and troubles with infertility.   Losing weight (right now we're not talking about whether or not you actually can lose weight), increases your estrogen levels because estrogen is stored in fat and when you lose fat more estrogen than normal is in your bloodstream. This is good and one of the reasons that women losing weight sometimes get pregnant accidentally.   I had all of the symptoms of PCOS, including the insanely high testosterone levels and have Cushing's disease and managed to lose a bit over 100 pounds. It took a while. I was 5'0, 230 lbs and lost 30 pounds in about 6 months. Most of the weight came off toward the end because I was trying to get the right mix of everything (I'll address that later). Then I lost about 65 pounds the following year and this year I've lost about 10 pounds. Thankfully, you have nowhere near 100 pounds to lose, only about 65 which is so much more manageable and not at all crazy or extreme. 220 pounds at 5'6 is a BMI of 35.5, which is obese (anything over 30 is obese) and medical science has proven that regardless of other conditions impacting obesity, fertility is generally poor in obese women.   I believe that you've tried everything. I'm not doubting you. The question is if you tried it all in the right combination. When you have a syndrome like PCOS that impacts your metabolism you really have to get all the pieces together perfectly to lose weight.   Walking your dog is a great start. Are you doing any sort of strength training or HIIT? HIIT doesn't have to be high impact, just high intensity. Strength training is great because it build muscle which increases your metabolic rate.   Food plans tend to be helpful for getting portion sizes right but the real trick is playing with carbs, calories and exercise. Having PCOS makes losing weight more difficult so everything has to be just right. You have to eat the right number of carbs, right amount of calories and do the right amount of the right kind of exercise. That's just trial and error, sadly. Given that you don't lose weight easily due to PCOS, you'll know right away when you have all the pieces just right.   Obviously, take this advice as a grain of salt. I'm not a doctor and I'm obviously not your doctor. If your doctor gives you advice that contradicts mine, obviously follow your doctor's advice.   If you want to talk, I'm here way too often. Good luck! I know you'll become a mom one way or another."

If that is still in effect, I would recommend extending it.   Also, have you called around to find out who would offer the best price on managing a UTI? I've saved a lot of money for pet care just by calling around.   Does he have a pet water fountain and lots of little cups/dishes of water throughout the house? A UTI in cats is often times due to lack of water. Cats don't like to drink a lot at one time (but for some reason they like moving water.. a lot!) so encouraging them to drink can be helpful in avoiding those UTIs.   Is Smeogol on a 100% wet food diet? With a history of UTIs you can encourage even more water consumption by feeding wet food. Canned and pouch food is 70 - 88% water. Any wet food will work, especially since you're on a budget.   Good luck to Smeogol!"

So far none of them have pulled my credit.  Since you don't currently have a lot of income, have you looked into a subsidized apartment complex? You'll still pay something but nowhere near market value.  Do you have any friends with a couple of rooms you could rent while you save up money and/or fix up your credit?   Good luck!"
Assistance,3djbxn,DiagnosisImpossible,8,Thu Jul 16 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"This. You may have the best intentions, but emergencies happen and you may find yourself in a position where you can no longer pay the rent. No one should ever cosign for someone unless they are willing to pay off the obligation.   If you have the choice (and it sounds like your mom wants you to stay) and everyone is safe, don't move out until you have enough in emergency funds (3-6 month's expenses)."

I wish I could send you my original copies of the two books i'd like to contribute to your class library, I got them in high school and both have dramatically changed my life in a way that only about half a dozen other books have, but I gave them away years ago and every time I get new copies I end up giving them away too. My collection is actually missing 4 of my favorite books because I gave them away and every time I get online to buy replacements I end up buying new books instead.  Would it be okay if I buy new copies of the two books I'd like to contribute and sent them once I've inscribed a message? One of the books I want to send will be purchased directly from the author so it will be signed but will also take longer to ship although it sounds like that won't be a problem."

You can always call ahead of time and check on the approximate cost. My mother has been to the facility in Arizona over the years as it was the closest hospital to her home.

Assistance,3d7mqy,RiverKeepsChanging,6,Wed Jul 15 00:54:48 2015 UTC,Thanks so much. I totally agree. We really need to learn to love each other and care about each other a lot more. We're all in this world together.
Assistance,3d7mqy,E_scribbles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:59:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know when I'll eat next, which I think is remarkable.  Remarkable because up until recently, I lived supremely well. I struggled to pay rent, but nevertheless I always had food, electricity, shelter, etc. I wasn't familiar with the concept of going to bed on an empty stomach or being so hungry that your body eventually becomes numb to it. I never knew what it's like to look into the mirror and see oneself lose weight and deteriorate in real time. Sadly, I've experienced all of these self-defense mechanisms first hand: the spontaneous welts, the infected bruises, the deafening migraines, the zombifying fatigue, the endless sleep schedule, so on and so forth.  I simply had no idea what this was like.  Strangely enough though, I'm grateful; I'm now looking at things from a different perspective. For as long as I can remember, I used to be so preoccupied with bettering and enriching my own life. I used to think I was in control of everything around me and that I didn't need anyone.  But I’m most definitely one of the lucky ones. After all, I still have my youth; I have time to learn/change. Not to mention, I have yet to be kicked out of my apartment (so I’ve got that going for me haha).  So OP, even so much as a single packet of top ramen from Amazon would be deeply, deeply appreciated. I promise to Venmo or PayPal you back once I’m back on my feet.  Thanks for taking the time to read this (:"

Office Depot staples all have a great back to school specials and since  she's a teacher she can get an additional discount. Last year I was able to get six hundred and forty seven dollars worth of supplies for under $25. I checked the ads and priced matched. Most stores have a limit of how many you can buy per day but she's a teacher they usually wave that limit. In my case when the store manager found out I was buying for homeless children they waived the limit completely."

Assistance,3d8jp5,writerlib,5,Wed Jul 15 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"Have you tried to see if you can get work study at your school, have you checked to see if your school's tutoring lab is hiring (you'll have to have  a good GPA though). Also, have you looked at your school's job center? The center can help you find jobs that you're capable for and help you with your resume.   A good tip for applying for jobs is to make sure your resume is up to date and professional. Have you asked anyone for help with your resume? Another good tip is when you're applying for a job is to send a cover letter as well, have you ever made one before? I can help point you in the direction of how to make one if you'd like. Another thing you may not think about that affects getting a job is your email/screen name, make sure it's professional.  If I were you I'd print out a bunch of resumes and walk around town, and places near your house, and ask if you can drop off your resume or fill out an application. I would also look up businesses in your area and go to their official websites and fill out their applications there. Sometimes they don't always make it clear that they are hiring, but their websites are clear and even if there's no hiring. Filling out an application can sometimes lead to a job anyways.   Another suggestion, I would look in to applying for temp agencies, they will find jobs for you and while they might only be temporary it will help beef up your resume.  I'd also look in the Gig's section on craigslist for temporary jobs. Some of those you might also be able to add to a resume and you ask people if they would be willing to be a professional reference for you."

Best case scenario these treatments are useless in ''curing'' autism, worst case they are potentially harmful to your child. Chelation is used in cases of severe heavy metal poisoning, the risks associated with the removal of important minerals needed for the body are immense. The ''doctors'' who claim that it's harmless because technically you're not ''adding'' anything to the body and just removing ''toxins'' are quacks.

He's a good guy, I know all he wants is his payments. So I'm hoping he will let me redo the loan. As of right now, the lawyer is not putting in the paperwork, he's waiting to see what I can come up with. I don't technically have the 1500 yet. It was a ""promise"" from the husband that he would have it by the end of this week, and now Monday. I'm holding out hope he actually comes through with at least that. If not, I'm even more screwed than I am now. I can make payments, I can keep our car and pay bills etc. just not that 7400$ thing. Monday I'm going to the courthouse for rent assistance, they pay 1 month if you have a job and a way to keep the payments up. But that still doesn't help the past balance. Keeping hope up, the property is not worth what we are paying, and I think the owner knows that, so if he ends up foreclosing, he won't get his payments and he will have to wait until we legally have to get out, and then he would have to resell it. And the one house is a 70 something trailer, holes in subfloor, plumbing is shot, we have been repairing it where it needs attention. Needs a new roof etc. it's probably negative worth.

It should also be kept up to date with the current sales tax information according to each country, state, territory and/or province.  For example: I live in Quebec, Canada and when I go shopping, I would like to be able to use a sales tax calculator so I can calculate my grocery bill and make the most of the money I have. It should be able to allow me to add each item's price and calculate the total sum + taxes. So if I want to add $2.25 + $3.49 + $17.83 it should calculate the total some of these prices and sales tax: $27.10.  It should also be able to work offline but require internet in order to receive updates.  Basically, I want this as an app (scroll down to the Java applet and let it load).    How about an app that allows grocery/store to upload what sales/discounts they're having so that not only will we/they save on paper flyers, but we'd also have access to hundreds of stores/locations at our fingertips. This app should also allow synchronizing so that information can be updated quickly and on time according to each store as well as give store location information, directions, open hours, etc.    An app that lets me decode Best Before and Use By codes on packages. Certain items don't have an actual date, but just a code, and we're somehow expect to know what each code means. An app that has an up to date code list according to each company/brand would be great."

Assistance,3cynjy,galebird,2,Sun Jul 12 11:50:37 2015 UTC,"Technically it is still true despite the ruling. The article says it does not set a precedent, and that the Jury decided the value of the dog was $39k rather than $10. So yes, the other party is still only on the hook for the value of the dog, and not for the bills.    Dennis and Dr. Flemming stressed that the verdict should not be misunderstood as an emotional distress award. Those are rarely granted for the loss of a pet.  ""This jury did not give an emotional distress award. This jury did not give a loss of companionship award. This jury did not give a punitive damage award. What it did was give a special value award,"" Dr. Flemming explained.   If Op's friends can afford to retain a lawyer (which is difficult during these times of emergency veterinary expense) then Op's friends can file a lawsuit, and get a jury trial if they believe the value of their dog exceeds the price they paid for it (as in the case of service animals, etc). Most people wont, as the cost of losing a jury trial on top of the expenses already incurred by a veterinary emergency is not something they are willing, or able, to risk. I myself was certainly not in a position to. I spoke to 2 attorneys and they both discouraged me from pursuing anything and said to just be glad the other people were willing to pay for my dogs first surgery."

I'm currently working FD at my desk and have a young girl here in a similar situation and she was very nice at check in so when she asked if there was anything for her to eat I set her up with a big plate of danishes. Or you can check to see if there's any sort of soup kitchen or shelter serving food in the area. Is your money on a debit card? If the deposit for the hotel room is a pending charge against your card it will not post until a day or 2 after you check out. You can buy food if you have overdraft protection and hopefully avoid a fee if the deposit is released before the food charge hits your account. If the account goes over and you do get a fee you can argue with the bank that you didn't realize they were holding more than the amount of the room and they would be likely to reverse it.

If you will be doing more serious trail rides or rock crawling then you need a straight axle Jeep. Cheaper to lift. Cheaper to modify. Easy to fix even in remote locations.

Assistance,3cxqlp,Senketsu-Kisaragi,2,Sat Jul 11 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"References are usually one from an academic circle and one from the industry (since you don't have one from the industry, you might want to put an employer if you had one - if you did a summer job, or something similar)    Separate your hobbies and skills.    HOBBIES! BE SURE TO ADD THEM! Seriously. Add your hobbies. This shows that you have interests apart from work, and might highlight some of your abilities not directly relatable to the position you're applying for, but still relevant in general    Here's my (badly translated) resume (I translated some stuff, but left some in the original language - for whatever reason, idk why I did it like that now. But it's on my drive and I'm too lazy to search for the fully translated one on my PC). You can look at the form and the info you can/should provide:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-t1PcbvnM4qaWNxa0RtSGFNMU0  Also while writing my resume. I tended to stay away from phrasing my sentences in first person. I don't know why but it seemed just better like that (it might not to you tho).  Your resume seems more like a letter to your future (possible) employer. A resume serves to usually just list your skills, etc. etc. It SHOULD look like an enumeration. If I were in your position (fresh out of school). I'd also provide a stunningly good cover letter, that'll really differentiate me from the other 99% that applied to the job."
Assistance,3cxqlp,RexGrammer,3,Sun Jul 12 02:36:12 2015 UTC,"Don't use the word ""lacking.""  You should be selling yourself, not highlighting your deficiencies.  Rework that sentence so it's positive (but still honest about no diploma)."
Assistance,3cxqlp,Ehynot,4,Sun Jul 12 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"The very first line where you state you're fresh out of highschool, don't use a contraction, say ""I am fresh out of highschool"" (same with line two, use ""I am prepared to work hard"", not ""I'm"") and don't capitalize highschool. It just seems more professional/serious doing it this way rather than using ""I'm"" in one phrase but then using ""I am"" in another. Simply use ""I am"" all the time. Also, make sure to add a period after line two under Summary.  There should be a space between reference 1 and reference 2 (as well as any other reference you add afterward), as well as a space between 2. and John Doe. The d in Jane Doe should also be capitalized. The t in teacher in the first reference should not be capitalized either. There should also be a space between each Skill line.  Also, remove the hyphen (-) between high and school and make it one word.  Make certain that the spaces between each header and the content beneath them as well as the spaces between each section are all the same. For example, if you used one space between Summary and the paragraph below, there should also be one space between Education and the content beneath it, Skills and its content, etc. This also applies between each section as well. It seems there are more spaces between Summary's paragraph and the Education header (there are there spaces) than there is between Education's paragraph and the Skill's header (there are two spaces).  Also, when indenting, make certain that all of your indented content, regardless of section, are all indented the exact same amount of spaces so they all line up exactly. So be sure that your date beneath Education, the references below the Reference header and your skills below Skills are all indented the exact same amount of spaces.  The red block should also be indented the same amount of spaces on its left as the main content of your CV is on its right of the page. Your John Smith and the content beneath it should be indented the exact same amount of spaces between the red block and the content on the right. So make sure it's centered between the red block and the main content of your CV.  Let me know if any of the above needs clarification."

April also helps out with financial needs, job opportunities, and so forth. It's like a one-stop solution that helps you get your life back on track. I used them before and it was really good.

She could also contact a food bank, like the:   Georgia Food Bank Association (click on Get Help on the food bank nearest you) and see if they can help her. Or America's Second Harvest for Coastal Georgia or Second Harvest for South Georgia, just click on the Contact Us for contact info.

What is the boyfriend doing? If he is working, why is he unable to support the family? If he is not working, why is he unable to watch the child while she works? If he is completely useless, why doesn't she leave him?  Has she looked into whatever day care subsidies might exist in her area?  Does she have any skills that could translate into work-at-home jobs?  Can she apply for financial aid to go to school, and train for a job?

Assistance,3cz1yr,her_nibs,-1,Sun Jul 12 03:15:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply, I'll try to answer as far as I know.    She lost custody due to not caring for her child's health, she was addicted to drugs at the time and is now clean.  The father of the toddler is her boyfriend whom she lives with, sorry for not clarifying that. Her boyfriend has a low income job, he is able to support the family itself, but the money cannot adequately cover all of their bills. I wish I had more to say about him but frankly I don't know much at all about him. I'm not sure, she claims to have applied for all the subsidies available to her, yet was denied. She has experience with video software (she used to live-stream gaming). I'm not sure, sorry. No, she cannot afford health insurance. She described to me that she is having ""heart problems"", I'm sorry for being so vague, but that's all she told me. Whatever it is, it worries her.   I'm sorry for not being thorough, she doesn't like asking for help or advice so I'm just providing what I know, and that isn't a lot."

Assistance,3cu7u2,sageamethystt,5,Fri Jul 10 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"Drawing commissions? Do you have a portfolio?   Also, is this your only reddit account? It's pretty new, that may make some hesitate to help. A lot of the assistance type subreddits require aged accounts to get help. For example, if you had a seasoned account you might be able to borrow money on /r/borrow. A lot of people will be hesitant to help someone with no account history.   Offline, if you have a steady paycheck, you might be able to go to a payday loan place. Payday loan places are SHARKS and it should be a last resort. Exhaust ALL your other options first (and NEVER fall for a title loan against your car).   Also, try calling the old vet and see if they'll send you a prescription. You might be able to order it online.   I don't know where you live, but some Veterinarians also offer free first exams for new clients. In the USA Banfield is one in many states that offers free first exams. Look in your area, check the phonebook (many have ads in phonebooks), google, craigslist. Call around and ask if they have specials for first time clients.   If you have a car payment and you are current on your payments, try calling your finance company and ask if they have a deferment option available. Most finance companies are willing to defer a payment in the event of a financial emergency, so long as you are on good terms. Deferring the payment moves the next payment to the end of your loan. It allows you to use the car payment money for your emergency. Be sure to find out all the terms though, as finance companies usually only allow a deferment once or twice during the lifetime of the loan - so be sure to use it only in a true emergency.   Call the utilities back and ask if you can break up some of your deposits if you haven't already paid them. Most want deposits up front, but I've had luck in the past with some allowing me to split them into two payments when I moved. You wont know unless you ask.   Moving boxes - you can sell your moving boxes easy on craigslist for about $1 each. Everyone wants cheap boxes it seems. As long as they're in decent shape you can probably sell them.   I've heard of people earning money donating blood, but I've never seen anywhere that pays.   Have you bought all your groceries yet? See if there is a food bank or church near you that can help you with some groceries so then you can use some of your grocery budget for the vet.   Pawn shops - pawn the TV or something else of value (the games?). If for some reason you cant pay the pawn back by it's due date, ask if they'll take an interest payment. Most places will renew the pawn if you pay the interest before it's due (ask them to confirm this before you pawn), allowing you to extend the pawn and not lose the item. Don't ever pawn anything you are unwilling to lose like a family heirloom though. Pawn shops experience theft sometimes too (though I had the opposite experience once, where I pawned a piece of jewelry and then someone stole some jewelry from my house - but my pawned jewelry was safe).   These are just a bunch of ideas, maybe one will help. A few years back I had just moved and my dog was mauled by 3 big dogs. It ended up costing over $5200 at a time where I had just spent ALL of my emergency savings moving. The owner of the 3 dogs paid for the first surgery $1400 thankfully, but I had to come up with the rest for additional surgery and a lengthy hospital stay. I went through my house and looked at everything I had of value and asked myself ""would I rather have this or my dog?"" and I pretty much sold or pawned everything that could fetch a dollar. My pup is sleeping right next to me as I type this. Worth every penny.   Best of luck with your cat. I hope she feels well soon!"

Assistance,3csxjv,HanSoLoMein,3,Fri Jul 10 14:49:00 2015 UTC,"I've been through this. Make sure that both of you are equally involved in budgeting and understanding your financial situation, because if one of you is shouldering more responsibility than the other, that will cause relationship stress. Communicate, but don't let it consume your life.   Try making a Paypal/Amazon Payments account and popping over to /r/beermoney and /r/mturk if you have a few spare hours to make money. If you find the right tasks, you can make $20 in a couple hours, which isn't a ton of money but it's enough to buy a few food staples.   Also, don't be afraid to seek out food pantries in your area. That's what they're for. Usually you can go once a month and they'll supply you with some frozen meat, lots of canned goods, some pasta and maybe some veggies if any are available. Anything helps.   Check out /r/budgetfood and /r/Frugal for cheap cooking tips. That will help you stretch what you've got even further.   For short-term help, check out /r/Food_Bank. Make an Amazon wishlist or a Walmart wishlist. I mod there and situations like yours are exactly what we're here for. I hope you can get back on your feet again soon! Hang in there, it will get better."

Every little bit helps.  We called pantries this morning before I posted.  Sadly, none of them could help us as we're both employed and the ones we called only help if someone is unemployed, you're on welfare, or you have children.  We didn't fit the criteria but we did check them out.  /u/power-cube actually helped us out with getting the ability to get some staples this weekend, so hopefully we won't have to hit up /r/Food_Bank as there are probably way more people in need of help than we are at this moment.

Assistance,3csxjv,MayoOfTheNaize,10,Fri Jul 10 22:16:27 2015 UTC,"Budget your food by freezing most of what you're able to.   Portion out your meat into single servings and freeze them so you only take out what you need for that day. Take a portion out for each person the day before and let it thaw out in your fridge for the next day. Portion out and freeze your bread and just take out a portion the day before so it can thaw. Don't worry, it won't ruin the bread. Buy frozen vegetables. Not only are they healthier for you because they were harvested at their peak ripeness, but they'll last longer. Just take out what you need for that particular meal into a colander, run some lukewarm water over the veggies to quickthaw them (don't use cold water, it'll just make them freeze to one another even more) and drain before cooking. You can fry, boil or add them to an oven dish just like you would any other vegetables. They may not be all that great for things like salad, but you want vegetables you can use for the entire month in meals. Buy a large bag of potatoes, don't get those small ones because those won't last long enough for what you'd end up paying for them. If you're able to, get a 50lb bag. I know it may seem like a lot, but in the long run when you realize that bag is able to last you around 2 months if you use it wisely, you'll be thankful you grabbed that big bag. Just be sure to dedicate the bottom half of your fridge to storing them. Also, if you keep them in the fridge, they will keep longer before beginning to sprout or go soft. They can last as long as 2 or so months in a cold, dry place like your fridge. Buy a large box/bag of rice. This will add more meals to your repertoire. Flour and powdered broth so you can make your own sauces and gravies and soups. Find some recipes online. Buy olive oil and use that for cooking your meats/veggies rather than use up your margerine/butter. Using this oil will not only be healthier for you, but it'll make other things last longer and it's versatile. You can use it to cook your meat, your veggies, make a vinegrette, make some cottage fries, or use it to make some really amazing baked potatoes. And don't worry, if you've never used olive oil before, it doesn't ruin the dish or taste like olives, it'll taste like whatever you're cooking with it. (Also, I recommend checking out that Food Wishes channel because he has a lot of really good tips/recipes for making nice things out of very little. And he's a lot of fun to listen to.) Get freezer Ziploc bags and those Ziploc Portion bags so you can portion out your meat and bread. Freeze your milk. Yes, it will taste fine, but just be sure that you leave room in the container because milk expands when it freezes and you don't want your container to burst. Don't just buy at one store: Check out other stores in your area for sales and discounts, check their flyers for special deals. If you have a printer, you can find coupons online that can be printed out. There's also the ramen noodle trick. Before you skip this part, wait. I know some people might find these unnappealing, but if you use them for things they're not really meant to be used for, they can be really nice. For example: Stir fry. Thaw out some veggies and meat, get some spices, soy sauce (or use VH Medium Garlic rib sauce if you're able to find it in your area, it's amazing for stir fries) and some oil. Cook up your meat and veggies with a bit of oil, add some spices to taste (don't add salt if you're using the VH rib sauce), then cook a pack of noodles (set the spice pack aside, you won't be needing it for this) for the 3 minutes, drain and add to your stir fry. Let cook for a few minutes longer so the noodles can absorb all that sauce and flavor before serving. Not only are the noodle packs relatively inexpensive, but they're portioned out perfectly and very versatile. Use them to make soups, to make a noodle side dish, in a stir fry, use the spice pack it comes with on your meats/veggies, use the spice pack as a broth, etc. We can get them for around 25c each here so you should be able to get about 30 for around $7. If you do get to find that VH sauce I mentioned above, it's also able to be used for other things than it's intended for: Use to cook your meats in, pork, chicken or beef (I recommend adding the sauce once your meat is pretty much done because this sauce will caramelize relatively quickly). Or marinate your meat in before cooking. You can use it with rice, pour on mashed potatoes or cook some veggies in like brocolli and snow peas. Use as a stir fry sauce or on your ribs in the oven. It has a sweet flavor but not overwhelmingly much, and goes really well with just about anything. Buy canned goods. Look around your stores to see if they're having sales on soups and the like. Grab them up if you're able to. And buy things that can have more than one use.   When you're buying your grocery, keep in mind that what you're buying has to be able to last you for more than one meal for the both of you. This is why I recommend portioning out your meat, bread, buying the 50lb bag of potatoes and frozen veggies. You need to think in terms of months, not days, so your groceries needs to not only last you a month, but if you did it right you'll notice that it actually carries over into the next month as well. This also ensures that you can both have an actual, healthy meal at least once a day, every day. I know it may seem like it's cheaper to just buy little things like pasta and beans and what not, but it isn't, and it doesn't help you. It's not about the price as much as it's about how much you can get out of every dollar that will last you more than one day. Pasta might be nice, but will that last you an entire month? Look at your local stores, you might be surprised at how little more it costs for more. We live on a tight monthly budget for groceries but we're still able to eat steak and potatoes every night. Some places have 50lb bags of potatoes for as little as $15, and that bag will last you a while if you store it right.  Bonus: If you don't already have one, I highly recommend in investing in a chest freezer. You'll be able to fill not only your fridge freezer with your meat, but your chest freezer with bread, frozen veggies, frozen fruit (that can be used into making jams and sauces), and other frozen goodies that will last you longer. Perhaps a friend can lend you one or let you make payments on it?  Check out your local dollar store if they have spices as well. Find some spices for very little so you can have more variety in your meals. They can also have brand name items that are just fine to use in your kitchen. If you don't recognize the brand name, don't use it, but if you do, then it's just fine."

Some places have large quantities for relatively little.  The most important thing is that you're able to eat a full meal every day. If you're able to scrounge up a bit more, then try to get some of the other items listed."

Unless you got it as is?   What year is it? What did you pay? Where did you get it from?  What do you mean by internals? Did you get a quota for the repairs?   Was the body kit on it when you bought it?  What happened to the bumpers?   Some schools offer a discounted bus pass if that interests you as well.

Assistance,3crx6w,QueenElizatits,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"Adult onset vitelliform macular dystrophy is pretty variable. They suspect that I had it and in the beginning it went undiagnosed by optometrists that I was seeing for check ups for a few years. This is entirely possible.   Even so, it took 2 months for the opthamologists to figure out what was wrong. It's so rare that when I come in for my eye shots every grad student is filed in to look at the slit lamp so they will know what they are looking for/at. And they want to see. Even the attending doctors at the clinic want to see, many have never seen a case of it in years of practice.   They are always trying to talk me out of getting shots, since they are worried about retinal atrophy and side effects. Honestly, if I don't get them I get rampant pigmentation changes and fresh hemes which cloud my vitreous fluid and make things darker. Then I really start to freak out.   I gave up trying to sweep and just use the vacuum now. Occasionally I will clog it by sucking up things I can't see. Then I have to call my son to unclog it for me. This pisses him off, but hey, at least I am trying!   My current machine is Win XP pro w/2 GB ram. They only made a past version for regular XP. Nothing for 64 bit. Sucks, but it's true. Rumor has it at support services that it's a RAM whore.   One of my fellow mods (I am a mod here) has told me to check out Win 7 and above, she says there are low vision and speech recognition built into the operating system. Don't know about that, I have only used Win XP (now set to the biggest text). That would be awesome, and if we can't raise enough to get ZoomText I will be looking into that. The program is $699 (fuck the disabled, right?). But the reason that I need it is that I need to train on it, because it's sort of the standard for the workplace and I do need to find work. Once I get it, I can take it with me (it comes on a flash drive) for any machine I need to use.   Most frustrating about it is that there isn't really a cure and they won't look for one because Best's is so rare and affect only about one in 15,000 people to begin with.

To get rid of your wife and your immigration situation you don't have to get back to Great Britain, you have to get back to the UK or the European Union, because there you can legally work and earn the money you need.    Both the UK and the European Union have oversea islands, for example the UK has the Cayman islands in the Caribik. Flights to these islands should be far cheaper than flights back to Great Britain.

Assistance,3cq27r,MadeUpInOhio,6,Fri Jul 10 02:27:31 2015 UTC,"Hi,   I have just read this leaflet about Uk nationals abroad: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317474/FCO_Brits_Abroad_2014.pdf  As it seems they  state that they don't provide financial  assistance for paying bills/ travels costs, etc because ' it is individual responsibility' to cover costs etc.   But- I have found this section below which might be relevant:    We may be able to provide an emergency loan from public funds to help you return home, but  If something happens to you  this is discretionary and will only be considered in very exceptional circumstances, and only if you have completely used up all other methods of getting funds. If you are eligible, you will have to sign an ‘undertaking to repay’ agreement, where you agree to repay the loan.   In most cases, you will have to secure this loan by giving up your passport to our staff, who will then issue you with an emergency travel document valid for a single journey to your country of residence. The cost of this document will be added to the loan. We will not return your passport to you, and Her Majesty’s Passport Office will not issue you with a replacement passport, until you have repaid the loan in full. If you do not repay the loan within 6 months, it will be subject to a surcharge of 10%.  It is up to us to decide whether we grant these loans – a lack of other ways for you to return home does not mean that we will automatically agree to it.    They also say that they will help you to contact  family/friends etc- and I presume  the embassy will require you to ask friends for money first- because embassy options should be considered last.   You'd also need to make a case that 'something happened to you' & that your situation has no other options.   Also start video recording your interactions with your wife which are likely to escalate into abuse- it will serve as evidence if your conflict ever gets into the legal territory."
Assistance,3cq27r,KimBERLY71,3,Thu Jul 9 23:09:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice and research.  I am currently stranded as I have looked at the potentials of borrowing to get back but it is a very expensive ticket to come out of the blue so no one is able to offer assistance at the moment.  I have no trouble paying back the loan though when I get back to the UK so that should be a potentially good option.  I can't record the conversations any more.  I recorded a couple on the request of the couples counselor and she is wise to that now.  During any rage fest from her she hunts for the phones first before unleashing her rage.

I do have a few questions for you and Sue:  1) Sue, when you said in the deleted Food_Pantry thread that the subreddit had been deleted because it ""was not a nice place"" in the last 6 months, what were you referring to? I genuinely would like to know, because I lurked there and received assistance there myself.   2) A lot of the animosity in the SRD thread was focused on the fact that moderators of Assistance receive assistance for themselves and for their families, both from their own subreddit and from elsewhere on reddit. Many users think that this creates a conflict of interest. Do you plan to address this?   3) A lot more animosity comes from the ""No Judgements"" policy, which users in SRD saw as detrimental to the givers of the sub. Givers are harder to maintain than requesters are, and it's perhaps important to protect them and keep them part of the sub. Do you plan to address this?   These 3 issues came up in the SRD thread far more often than Sue's alleged involvement in closing Food_Pantry did, so I think a lot of users are interested in hearing your answers.   I understand how that second point might be silly coming from me, since I received assistance from Food_Pantry and RAOPF last month myself. I was going through a transitional period, I now have a new job, and I never expected to actually keep /r/Food_Bank myself... I messaged Glinda, McRedson and others from Food_Pantry asking them to take it over and they opted not to. As a mod of /r/Food_Bank, if I ever need assistance myself in the future, I would take myself off the mod team to avoid any conflict of interest.   At any rate, I definitely did not mean to start a shit storm when I posted in Assistance earlier this week asking where Food_Pantry has gone. I miss the old sub, and now all I want to do is resolve and move past this. I hope that we're able to continue helping users in /r/Food_Bank and I thank everyone who has volunteered to be a part of it so far. I couldn't do it without you.   Thanks for your transparency, Wayne."
Assistance,3cqpm8,Girlpirate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:53:34 2015 UTC,"/r/Food_Pantry is one of a handful of subs I started lurking about 8 months ago when I was going through a ridiculously hard time (left abusive husband, was starving, the dude was tormenting me, fun times, etc). I spent a few weeks lurking in different places, getting a feel for how things work, being self conscious and generally hesitating to ask for help. When you've been abused, that's half the battle; reaching out. You spend so long being alienated from people, put down, etc, that you're really uneasy about reaching out. I learned quickly that people being judgmental in the help subs was a relatively common thing.   I ultimately chose not to ask in /r/Food_Pantry, mainly because the atmosphere made me uneasy. A lot of good was being done there. A lot of generosity was distributed, a lot of people fed. But there was also something weird; people could be mean. Not just asking questions or verifying information... but downright mean. I knew I didn't have the emotional capacity at the time to handle it if they were like that to me.   One thing I saw happen more than once, was people would view a user's list, find it full of unhealthy stuff, then berate the user for being fat in their request post.    ""your whole list is junk food""  ""I see by your past posts that you and your whole homeless family is fat""   Nutritional advice, ideas for healthier stuff to add, etc, all would have been great here. Instead half a dozen people were ganging up on the guy. One even linked to old pictures he'd posted of himself to prove he was fat. If this had happened to me, I'd have lost my shit. Anyone who has ever been homeless can tell you that you don't have a lot of options for preparing or storing food. Eating a bag of crisps for dinner isn't healthy, but that 5lb economy-sized bag of dry beans is also feckin useless if you have nowhere to cook it. I felt so bad for the guy... then a few weeks later, I saw something similar happen to a different woman requesting. For a community that did so much good, it shocked me.  The ""no judgments"" policy in this sub may be flawed, but it does have a purpose. As someone who has spent time hovering over the ""post"" button, hungry and debating whether I want to risk bullying or just try my luck at the Pizza Hut dumpster after closing, I can say that knowing there is some level of protection against that shit is damned comforting. I don't envy Wayne one bit having to mediate this; having to decide what comments are too far, putting up with the shitstorms, etc. And at the end of the day, people forget that he's just trying to create a safe place for people to post when they're at their lowest.  Like I said, the system may be flawed. There is a lot to be said for open communication and dialogue. Asking questions is important. Requesters should of course be protected, but so should givers be protected for scamming.  So what to do about it?   I don't know, but none of the shit I've seen going on in recent months is getting anyone closer to answers. The trolling, the downvoting Wayne's profile (no one try telling me this doesn't happen - I see the man tell someone he's sorry their spouse is dead and his comment is -4... come on people, grow up).  Submitting things to SRD (are we 13, seriously). Sending mods death threats?  I see the same usernames slip out of the woodwork whenever there's drama, but those folks are never around otherwise. There's no attempts to bring these issues up and communicate like adults outside of the occasional shitstorm.   What is any of this accomplishing? It's so frustrating to me to see so many people who all seems to want the same thing - to help others - devolving into this sort of clusterfuck.   It's time to set personal feelings and butthurt aside and figure out some real answers for a change.  I kind of went on a tangent with this. I'm avoiding cleaning snake poop."

I've heard that someone got doxxed over the last couple of days as a result of the SRD thread and that's completely unacceptable.   I want to encourage givers to verify and ask questions but obviously abusing legitimate recipients is no good either, so I appreciate your description... I honestly did not see it. Obviously, Wayne is free to run his subreddit the way he wants to, and if that includes a no judgement policy it's his prerogative.   I hope /r/Food_Bank can have a middle ground that helps and protects both the givers and those in need. Suggesting better food items is fine, linking pictures and calling someone a fatty is not. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them. I've never modded a subreddit before, much less an assistance subreddit, so I know I have a long and rocky road ahead of me while I figure all of this out.   P.S. Have fun cleaning snake poop, sounds like a party."

Everything about this is terrifying to me.   I said something nice about Wayne a month or so ago, in a post outside of this sub. One of his haters searched out my old request post and sent me a PM (using an alt that had clearly been created for the occasion) telling me that I'd deserved to be abused by my husband for supporting Wayne, and that they hope all my snakes die. I'm pretty unflappable when it comes to me, but saying those things about my beloved cuddle sausages freaked me the hell out.   This shit isn't just ""I disagree with the way he runs his sub"" anymore. It's a creepy clusterfuck of fail. I hope people can realize this and move away from this extreme level of frightening bullshit to enact some productive changes.    I hope /r/Food_Bank[1] can have a middle ground that helps and protects both the givers and those in need.    This is what I think is important. People can ask questions and even disagree in ways that are polite and productive. No need to make OPs feel like crap.  A few months ago, I installed one of those apps that restores deleted comments because I was curious (after a shitstorm, of course) about the material that was being deleted from comments. Most of it is pointless trolling crap like ""get a job"" or the like. Or comments/questions that are very obviously accusatory in nature or needling the OP.

Report it. This whole idea that Wayne has haters that will track down other users he helps and send them threatening PMs just sounds strange. None of us that I know who disagree with him, care enough to do that.    Between this story, and another one about ""one of us"" supposedly doxxing Sue this week (We didn't, no one cares where she lives), I'm starting to wonder if someone isn't staging or planting these PMs to make Wayne's critics look bad, and make him look better in comparison. Or to gain sympathy. It's a pretty common tactic on the Internet when you need to gain public favor. Just a theory. In the future, I'm not taking any claims of ""doxxing"" or ""being threatened by PM"" seriously unless  there's a screenshot that accompanies the accusation.   Lastly, everyone I know that has been outspoken about this subreddit loves animals, and none of us would condone sending PMs about any harm coming to them. This sounds whack.

It's very helpful in catching people who lie and put a school as their address, or you find the same address registered with a new account, etc.  But the possibility for that info to fall into a vengeful and angry person is there and after seeing what some people do to people they think either: receive too much help, aren't sincerely in need, are scamming, have discrepancies in details, have a less than admirable post history, etc--has made me re-think my original thought that registering personal info is a positive.  I now firmly believe that people shouldn't be required to give internet strangers their personal info, and hopefully /u/sprinklenoms gives this some thought if the idea of similar registration is brought up for food_bank.  Personally, as a giver, I'd rather do my post history checks, ask any relevant questions if I see something I don't like or understand (and be comfortable that other people are allowed to ask as well, so ""we the community"" feel assured that someone may see something that another missed), and give my help.

As someone who gives on this sub I absolutely have my concerns and I've learned the hard way to not be so trusting. I've been scammed, PM'd and guilt-tripped, whatever, it's not the end of my world. Requests for cars, houses, vacations, invitro, bacon and marshmallow fluff equally irritate and amuse me. I just shake my head and move on. My only hope is that ultimately I've sent to someone something that actually helped them through a rough time in their life.   But, at the end of the day, it's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I want with it. My bills are paid, my kid is fed, my tank is full and I'm not asking for help in order to give help.   Anyway, I found this comment to be disturbing, it feels like a dismissive and condescending acknowledgement of her abuse used as a means turn the topic back to your own personal agenda. Which mostly seems like vilifying BPW.      Unless you personally have had the shit beat out of you physically, emotionally, financially and sexually you're not really in a position to tell a survivor what they are allowed to feel in regards to anything which might threaten their sense of safety. Anyone how has been through it typically knows not to make those types of statements. A terse, ""None of us are hunting you down"" isn't necessarily going to be the panacea that cures that fear.       I have not read that /u/Girlpirate has at any point accused a former mod of doxxing. BPW's haters appear to be legion. Trolls gotta troll and trolls target the vulnerable just for the sadistic thrill of the kill. Insinuating that a victim is making up stories unless they provide concrete proof that they were victimized, is in my opinion, very cruel.   As for the users who love to jump on the ""let's go vet everyone"" bandwagon, okay, but I don't really understand why everyone gets their undies in a bunch over money that doesn't belong to them."

In fact, I discussed it with one of my mods yesterday.   While I do think that /r/Food_Bank should be a safe space for givers, I also think that givers should feel able to vet recipients for themselves. If someone receives a lot, or posts on Random Acts subs a lot, you as a giver have the option to read their post history and decide ""I won't give to that person.""   At the same time, you have the freedom to decide that their request is valid and that you want to fulfill it. You have the option to ask the user for proof of their overdrawn bank account, or not. YOU should feel free to do as much or as little legwork as you want to ease your mind.   Users can feel free to share what they've found about a user as long as they're factual about it (e.g. ""This is /u/XXX's scamming alt and here's how I know,"" or ""Your request post contradicts what you wrote on XXX thread,"" NOT ""You have poptarts on your wishlist so you're obviously not in need of food"" or ""You post on /r/trees so you're obviously an irresponsible drug addict."")   Requiring users to give mods their personal information would probably be micromanage-y and also potentially dangerous, like you've said. I love my mod team and I think they're doing a great job, but who knows who might get their hands on a spreadsheet full of usernames, home addresses and phone numbers? After hearing that people have already been doxxed as a result of the subredditdrama thread, I don't want to have a doxxing directly on my own hands.   It's something that I'll have to consider heavily, and I'm sure there are alternatives for vetting users. As always, I welcome advice."

If I got scammed, 9 times out of 10 I won't even know.

Assistance,3cqpm8,myfriendscallmejen,16,Fri Jul 10 04:53:52 2015 UTC,"I think this is enough to stop accusing Sue of being the reason Food Pantry was shut down, even if only because it's not going to get anyone anywhere.  Sue's been called out for the statement she made about the closing, some people want some an apology or statement of fault, you want statements of apologies.  No one is going to get the actual apologies they're looking for, but that's not a bad thing...it's just a thing.  It can be disappointing, but everyone should just let it go.  Some of the comments made in the SRD thread were rather insultingly written, and that's a shame because it makes it harder for rational discussion to take place, in addition to obviously being insulting.  They weren't necessary, but rather than go after anyone for it, let the comments stand so others can see and decide for themselves if someone is being a dick.  With all that being said, the assumed reason for the closing of Food Pantry was not the only thing some were attempting to discuss in that thread, and only pinging on that is deflecting away from a lot of what people were shocked to learn.  What I gathered from the thread was that people didn't feel that mods (and their families) of charitable subs should be active in receiving or requesting said charity.  There was also the issue of making some mod requests stickied.  Anyway, since I was a part of the SRD thread, I thought I should add my thoughts here.  Honestly, run this sub how you want.  You are always going to have people who disagree.  But I think you should also understand why people don't think it's right for mods to use their own sub for repeated gain.  Being a mod elevates your status to the average user and a mod's weight in promoting help for someone is going to go further than the average joe's.  Since a mod inherently has an advantage from this, assistance requests should be few and far between and as ""un-modlike"" as possible (ie: don't sticky a post, don't distinguish a post, etc), or it will be seen as an abuse of power.  *Edit:  A lot of people need to chill with the downvotes all over this place.  It's kind of ridiculous.  Stop downvoting everything someone posts, simply because you don't like them."
Assistance,3cqpm8,CatCasual,2,Fri Jul 10 04:57:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed that your concerns were the major talking points of the SRD thread and it would be nice to see them addressed.

Assistance,3cqpm8,myfriendscallmejen,3,Fri Jul 10 01:30:34 2015 UTC,"Sue ""allegedly"" closing the sub was a symptom.. the disease itself is that users are overwhelmingly not in favor of the moderators using this and other subreddits as their emergency savings fund.  Things happen. Bills show up out of nowhere. Everyone has tough times. But there is a limit. Numerous funerals, IVF, heating oil, groceries, Christmas gifts, Father's day wishlists, Mother's Day wishlists, laptops...  just stop.   Quit playing boss on the Internet all day and find a second job. Buy yourself the things you want, rather than relying on the users you moderate all day. Hold yourself to a better standard.

I would like to state my co-mod on Food_Pantry (McCredson/also a Mod on RAOP) has  been banned from posting to this subreddit along with approximately 6 or 7 other redditors who have dissenting opinions from the current moderation team.  Therefore, I feel this thread is really biased to one side so it truly is not an open-forum.  I will state that Food_Pantry was an awesome sub and helped many people.  I did have a policy there that the givers should be protected, and I tried to run a tight ship; I had zero tolerance for scammers and wholeheartedly encouraged givers to verify, verify, verify.  Sueolsen did not like the way things were run there and has expressed that point quite clearly.  It was not a drama, drama sub as she stated.    Sueolsen is glad it is shut down, and my hope is she gets totally behind r/Food_Bank so truly needy deserving redditors get the help they need.

This is based on a supposed conversation that no one has heard or even knows occurred. Some one please tell me, who was the original person that made the claim this conversation occurred? I mean the only thing used to claim sue had a part in this, is this one imaginary conversation. Who is the person that is claiming that conversation occurred? And why is it being assumed as true.

Did the reddit admins provide you with a /r/food_pantry modmail that was intended to be sent Glinda and Mcredson?  Why would the admins not send this modmail to the moderators of food_pantry when they requested help on getting their sub back and only send it to you?  Do you think this is preferential treatment when they did not provide this modmail to anyone other than you, and you did not ask for it, and they ""reached out"" to you to give it to you?  Have you ever used your relationship with reddit admins to get people like JenGomez and several others shadowbanned? For example, do you message specific admins directly for help instead of going through the general reddit PM?"
Assistance,3cqpm8,myfriendscallmejen,7,Fri Jul 10 01:20:29 2015 UTC,"I think the shitstorm was because she said that the sub owner was a close friend of hers, and that it was shut down because it had turned unfriendly. Maybe a coincidence, but this was not long after there was some drama relating to requesting on multiple accounts there or something like that.  I don't know why the owner made the decision to close it of course, but what you post here doesn't clarify it, and it proves nothing about who was involved or what was communicated. Still, thanks for sharing."
Assistance,3cqpm8,myfriendscallmejen,-2,Fri Jul 10 01:16:28 2015 UTC,"It shows she did not do anything they said she did. The head mod did it all. So if you have anyone to blame, it is the head mod. The head mod there demoted all the other mods and then shut it down. Sue had long since left.  It is absurd to put the blame on someone else because they were a friend of the person responsible. Why has no one even mentioned the person that shut it down? Instead they blame it on a friend of theirs? The logic of that is absurd."

In the beginning, a gym is not really necessary, but if you really want to go to a gym, look into a less expensive one. Planet Fitness is pretty popular at $10/mo and the YMCA will usually negotiate your fee down to $20/mo.   Don't think that a gym is the only way to get in cardio and resistance training. There are tons of cardio workouts on Youtube, everything from step aerobics from the 80s to kick boxing. For resistance training, you can do a full body workout with calisthenics. There's a reason that armed forces physical tests don't involve machines.   More than anything, it is important to remember that you can't out train a bad diet. You can workout for an hour a day but if you eat too much food you'll stay heavy. Different diets work for different people. I was almost twice the size I should've been so I ate whatever I wanted, with an emphasis on adding in fruits and veggies, and I just cut my portions in half. At this point I'm so used to half sized portions that I have no trouble maintaining my weight and I eat whatever I want. Some people like Weight Watchers (which you can do by yourself with materials found online) and other really enjoy TOPS. TOPS stands for Take Off Pounds Sensibly. Membership cost $30 a year. Honestly, though, I didn't use any of it. I woke up one day and decided to change the way I eat and when I had lost about 20 pounds and saw that it was really working, I decided to add in exercise.

Recently I have been getting a lot of hateful messages from folks on twitter, facebook and a few other places I have this campaign shared. It baffles me as to why this is happening but it is.   I honestly have no clue as to why folks are acting like this towards us but it is happening none the less. it may be because they do not consider our plight as a logical financial need. I agree. We could live without the air being fixed but it has been three years now since this air has worked properly for us and it has cost us a lot of money in the long run.   For three years now we have dealt with $200 power bills in the summer and $400 in the winter. It's folks like the ones being hateful that I stopped asking for help from anyone so many years ago. For some reason when you need help you get crapped on or looked at as if ""You are not doing enough"".  A few of you have helped us out and I cannot begin to tell you how thankful I am for that but most of you have ignored our financial need and these are people that me and my wife call friends, coworkers and even some family. Honestly it's what we deserve.  We are giving the campaign a little more time but if it does not pick up we will just have to go get a fourth, larger window unit.

I have called shelters in my area, as well as several church organizations, and everyone told me they would put me on waiting lists.  I gave them my information and have not heard anything back.  I have applied for low income housing/HUD and am on a 6 to 12 months waiting list.  I have applied for food stamps here, and they were not able to process my application until I got proof that I was not receiving assistance from my previous state, Florida.  Despite having not been on food stamps for almost 4 months, I still needed a letter, and they would not allow me to have them fax it to them, so I am waiting for 7-10 (should be soon now though) days for it to arrival so we can start the process over again, and she said it would be another 6-10 days to see if we were approved (which confused me because others I have spoken to said they received emergency food stamps the same day).  Another problem with this is that I do receive a small about in SSI (400), which is what we have been surviving on so far, and because I am ""homeless"" all that money should be applied to for food, but I am using it to pay for food, gas, and payment for the campground, which only lets you stay for 21 days on one location, and 21 at the other (15 in our last day here, and than we will be moving into the van) because we can't afford the prices at the other campgrounds in the area.  The one we're staying in is 11.00 a night primitive site (I use the bathroom plug in for my son's nebulizer) and the others in the area are 25-35 a night for a primitive, no utilities campground.  I have spoke to Human Services, I have called 211, I reached out to my family, and the churches in the area are all apart of http://smarm.org/ and I am on that waiting list, have been for a month now.

Assistance,3cpqs6,Naivy,2,Fri Jul 10 06:34:53 2015 UTC,"I'm very sorry for your friend's loss, but I'm curious what could be accomplished by this petition. In order to convict somebody of a crime, you need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person was guilty. It sounds here like, tragically, it is impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one suspect over the other could have done it.  Basically, your friend is proposing that we take away somebody's liberty not because we can prove that they committed a crime, but because we can't prove that they didn't. This runs contrary to some very deeply-held Western values which have been around for centuries, and which are enshrined in basic fundamental law. I'm afraid of what the consequences would be if the petition were successful, and I certainly can't sign it."

Assistance,3cpuyt,Medicaidthrowaway101,0,Thu Jul 9 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily advise this unless absolutely necessary, but in my state, if you're uninsured, the state will basically take over as the insurance company and pay hospitals for their service to you. It's not Medicaid or Medicare, it's just called the uninsured program. Since hospitals cannot deny you for lack of coverage, you may be able to use this in the short run assuming your state uses this plan.   Secondly, I would take that Medicaid request up the chain of command. You should not be rejected."

I would ask to speak to a supervisor in all my years of helping people apply for and get assistance I have never heard that 198 is all you can make a month. Most states have a fairly high limit on what you can make before you get denied.

We're basically paying for only necessities and they need help with that too. If I don't help, a vehicle, the house, light or phones don't get paid. It's a crappy situation all around.

I have so many medical bills it isn't funny and so far there hasn't been a hospital/lab/doctors' office/etc that wouldn't set up a payment plan with me with no interest.

What more could you ask for really.  lol  My grandmother was awesome.  She lived two block away from me most of my life.  I did yard work for her every summer and in return, she bought me things at the NEX that my mother would NEVER have allowed, like a leather biker jacket.  She was my paternal grandmother, and the only grandparent living during my memory.  Both my parents were younger children of older parents.  Losing your mom is hard.  I think I had a nervous breakdown when I lost mine.  I dropped out of college, fucked up at work, went a little haywire...

To OP and to anyone donating... As you might know, in a lot of places, locals will sell DVDs at really cheap prices to our troops. That's great! What's a lot LESS great is sometimes DVDs are stolen off base and sold back to the service members. Mark the DVD case and the front of the DVD itself with permanent marker to prevent this from happening.   Also...  If anyone wants to help OP but doesn't want to spend the shipping it'll cost you to mail such heavy items (or just doesn't own physical books or DVDs anymore) - consider digital. Depending on the deployment, plenty of people have laptops/tablets (and even XBoxes and Playstations in some cases) while they're overseas.   While he's deployed, I've sent my guy thumb drives full of e-books, movies, and TV shows. He and his buddies like them a lot. They're light, small, and easy to carry around. They can pack them up and take them home if they want because they don't take up room in their luggage. They can pass them around, copy them onto their individual laptops, etc.   One last thing for anyone sending stuff - be mindful of the laws in the particular country you are shipping to. For Muslim countries, you can't send things like any pork products (no little cans of Vienna sausages!), religious materials contrary to the Islamic faith, political materials... And definitely don't think you'll brighten some hot soldier, airman, sailor, or Marine's day by sending a bunch of nudes or a porn stash. I'm not saying you wouldn't brighten his day, you totally might, but people could get in trouble for mailing/possessing illegal materials.

My recommendation? Find a job, find an apartment. Make some money, save some money, and go to a community college for 2 years. THEN transfer in to whatever school you want.   If you're already in a tight spot, adding MASSIVE DEBT to your history isn't going to help you more.   Try NECCO in Haverhill. Dirt cheap, GOOD SCHOOL, rent in the area can be found for reasonable prices.  There is nothing you're going to learn in your first two years at UMassA that you can't learn for like 1/10th the price at NECCO."
Assistance,3cfs7r,scsibusfault,7,Tue Jul 7 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"Fill out a FAFSA.  It's too late for this semester but you'll need it for 2016. Search for all possible scholarships you are eligible for.  You will probably have to resort to loans since the fall semester is fast-approaching.  If you do, be careful and conservative.  Don't get a loan to cover living expenses, get a job to cover that instead.  Only take out loans for the bare minimum that you need.  They can haunt you for life, seriously.  Get a job (or two) and work your ass off, take extra shifts, take night shifts, mow lawns, babysit,  sell stuff you don't need/want anymore whatever.   No one owes you your education.  Don't get me wrong, I feel for your situation.  I have been in it.  I didn't have help paying for school aside from need-based grants and scholarships I earned by getting good grades and test scores.    I worked full time waiting tables and I had a work-study at my university to pay for my living expenses.  I made it work.  I didn't finish school but it wasn't because of the money, it was a personal situation.  I'm just trying to convince you that you don't need to depend on the charity of others to go to school.  Even if people do ""donate to your cause,"" it likely won't be enough.    Do it yourself.  It will be much more rewarding."

Simple visitation without supervision should be a thing you can self-represent for and go through the court system without an attorney and get.  ""How much"" is kind of unanswerable, but figure $2k and up for a retainer and then the sky's the limit depending on how far you and the ex drag the fight out. For free/cheap: often no, unless you qualify for a legal aid scheme and there's some sort of need (is there anything unusual about your situation?). 3. Months to decades; one day in family court I watched the parents of a twentysomething student (daughter didn't want to reveal her address to her father, father thought she should be obligated to because he still had support obligations. Judge ruled: no). 4. Self-represent unless things are very complex or unusual. Try mediation. 5. Document everything; keep your communication with your ex in writing, and don't delete/throw it out.  If your nose is clean, so to speak, and there's no reason you shouldn't have unsupervised visitation, I'd just go ahead and start the court process without an attorney.

Assistance,3c7zub,StakeMeOutTonight,2,Sun Jul 5 21:39:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, so you're trying to go to a different school and they need proof of classes you've taken to transfer credits and all that jazz? (I went to two universities as an undergrad, but they both had residency requirements, as I recall. You couldn't transfer senior year. You HAD to do a minimum number of classes at the new school in order to qualify for a degree from that school, so senior year was too late to transfer. So I was assuming you were staying at the same school.)  Are you in a position to take a personal loan? I know it's not ideal, but... I'm not sure how else to clear that debt to the school in a timely fashion in order to secure transcripts. I think it's perfectly legal for the school to withhold the degree if you owe them that much money.  Maybe someone else will come along and comment with better resources that might be able to help you. I hope so! :("

I'm not a doctor so I would suggest seeking help with handling your schizophrenia and related issues. You need to make sure you have some kind of way to help yourself. There's no point finding your dream job if you start believing it's a DEA shell company set up to entrap you; for example.  Getting diagnosed with that condition is going to make employment difficult. Your best bet should probably be to pick up where you left of and continue your plans to start that business.  If your inventions are what you start they are then it shouldn't be too difficult to get some investment to fund manufacture etc. Albeit in return for equity.

Assistance,3c6k0x,MildlyMoist,-1,Sun Jul 5 13:50:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, but to be honest it's pretty disheartening.    I tried for four years to do it all on my own.  The scope of some of the projects means I need certain types of assistance to get them to market before they become obsolete, and  I ruined most of my contacts in the industry when I melted down.  I haven't the slightest clue where to find investors outside of kickstarter, and I need a working prototype for that.  Even if I worked on finishing this one prototype non-stop it would be months before I get the bugs worked out, and that's if everything goes as planned.  I need to make a tachometer and do all the coding from scratch. If I get a normal job it will decrease the time I have to work on it.  I have absolutely zero resources in this town to help me with that.  I have no health insurance since I can't pay the bill, and I'm down to one pill that I'm saving for an emergency.    Sorry, if that sounds pessimistic, but it's the reality of my situation."
Assistance,3c6k0x,MildlyMoist,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:27:57 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately that's the business you're in. Getting a prototype made is relatively easy to do and doesn't require much money (I have a few prototyped designs myself). Presentation prototypes however are a bit more, but you wouldn't need that for a while.  If this is really what you want to do then you have to bite the bullet and do what needs to be done to do it. If you have to work 12 hours a day at a fast food joint to make ends meet and fund your prototypes and health insurance, then that's what you need to do.  I delivered magazines for two years so I could work towards my life goals. Having an end goal in mind is the only way it's manageable.  Being defeatist and 'pessimistic' will only keep you in the situation you're in now. But that sounds like part of the issue with getting your health concerns managed. I don't see a way forward without you doing that.  In your OP you talked like you knew what was what and you were finishing up prototypes. But in your reply you told me it was all doom and gloom and it would take months. So which is it?   Not trying to be mean but you talked about yourself like you were hot stuff in your original OP, but now you talk like you have no confidence or experience.   Maybe you can clear that up so we can continue to think about what you can do for yourself?"
Assistance,3c6k0x,MildlyMoist,0,Sun Jul 5 16:26:39 2015 UTC,"I certainly never intended to come off that way. I apologize.  I was mealy trying to convey the sense of enthusiasm I felt at the time. That is all.  I am completely confident in my abilities and my ideas.  I discussed some of them in detail with industry leaders at the time, and they agreed that these are viable products, and that no one was developing anything like it at the time.  I was unable to sleep at all last night, and haven't had much to eat.  That always throws me into an anxious/depressed state, and I apologize for that.    I was messing with a program and discovered some interesting behaviour.  After a while I realized this behaviour could be used to do almost all of the things that the user community kept saying was impossible. When I tried to tell them this they pretty much turned their noses up at me and said ""prove it"".  I did, and was mostly treated with more scepticism.  At the same time I discovered another type of behaviour that could do something else that everyone said was unlikely, but it needs a hardware component to function properly.  So I set out designing that.  I am absolutely confident that it would be a success.  I know that I have an awesome design because I put a lot of time and effort into it.  I am proud of it.    While working on that prototype I had another flash of inspiration, and realized I was potentially sitting on some ideas that could propel me to a place in life where I could do something I enjoyed AND help out many different groups of people.  The money doesn’t mean much to me because I have a strong distaste for money and wealth hoarders, but being in a position where I could provide for my parents in their old age, and support a family too, well, that is tempting.  Over a period of 2 years I (a relative novice) was routinely breaking boundaries, and doing things that leading professionals were telling me were impossible/unlikely.  I have pride in that.  I do not apologize for having pride in my hard work and good ideas, but I am sorry if you find that distasteful.   Anyway, my experience is mixed, and I am not a businessman.  I just kinda fell into that role. I don't know everything, but I definitely know enough to back up everything I said as being accurate.  Make of that what you will.    The only reason time is a big issue now is we are approaching a release-cycle that I expect could deliver competing products.  If I had released two years ago (when I wanted) I would have had a whole cycle before a competing product emerged.  So yes this could be obsolete or highly competitive soon.  That's why I talked about needing help to get it to market quickly. Yes, I could do it all myself, but the chance to get a whole cycle to myself is diminishing.

Assistance,3c6k0x,AppellofmyEye,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:23:32 2015 UTC,"That clears most things up just fine.   Sounds like you know what you need to do. It's just the doing it that's the issue?   Can you patent your designs? This could give you some breathing space to get yourself back on your feet. You could licence the patent or force competing companies to create alternative, less effective methods which would give your product an edge; whenever it comes to market.  I feel like you need a little something to give you some breathing room to just work a little, earn a little money and get some kind of medical assistance sorted. Admittedly my knowledge on your condition is limited to the internet and documentaries but I don't think I've heard of anyone managing it entirely on their own.

Assistance,3bzvk4,Virgoan,3,Fri Jul 3 14:30:27 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I handle a service dog for my son who is too young and due to his autism + age unable to handle the dog himself.   I would absolutely love to tell you there's loads of places that offer ""free"" service dogs but sadly, there's not. What you do not put up in money you will have to sacrifice in time waiting. Even if you fundraise or pay out of pocket for a dog, there's a wait because most reputable agencies want to tailor the training of the dog to the recipient's specific needs.   A guard dog is not necessarily what might do him best. Just the companionship of a service dog might fit the bill to alleviate the fears he may have. He could use a mobility assistance dog to help him when his crutches fall, to retrieve items as needed and to do other tasks that help him mitigate his disability. A good service dog is crate trained and able to go into the yard, do their business and return inside when beckoned to do so. Walking without a leash will be a sticking point as leash laws apply to service dogs as well as pet dogs. The only time an SD can be off leash is when they are performing a task directly. However, good SDs do not walk out of step with their handler and do not pull, so as their relationship develops a good trainer or organization can help him figure out how would be best for him to handle his dog. There's lots of different kinds of adaptable harnesses, etc.   One organization that can help is Canine Companions for Independence. They will help someone with a disability like his, but I am unfamiliar with their costs, etc. If nothing more it is a good place to start. If he considers engaging a private trainer to train a dog from puppyhood for this task, be sure to encourage him to properly investigate the trainer. They should be involved with choosing the puppy, socializing the dog from a very young age and building the dog's skills over time - and understanding that your friend is unable to manage the care of a young dog before they are at least finished with the housebreaking and crate training portion of their training.   Good luck! If you have any questions I'll help where I can - if I do not have the answers myself I can ask people who likely do. :)"

I was able to get help with my rent even though it was over the local market rate because I am too sick to work and need accessible housing. It can't hurt to apply and talk with a case manager. If they can't help with rent, ask if they would be willing to cover a motel room for you.  I would also recommend that you get a referral for a shelter. You need to have referrals for them and an eviction notice will help you to obtain one. If you have furniture or items you can sell, sell them in a fire sale. Things you can't sell put into a storage unit. Make copies of all your important paperwork, and put your birth certificate and other important things into a leak proof zip-lock bag and store them somewhere safe.  Contact local charities like united way, catholic charities and salvation army for emergency assistance and if you have any family/friends, let them know what is happening.

Unfortunately, the demand for assistance is far higher than the supply of donations. I don't think I've ever seen help given to pay off student loans. It's seen as a price people choose to pay in exchange for education. Plenty of people have them and survive just fine.   If you hang around here long enough, you'll see that most of the requests that get help are those asking for ""reasonable sums"" (tens to low hundreds of dollars) for emergencies that could make or break that person's finances or for a hand up when that person is so close to being financially independent. Requests that come across as ""I could use a little more money"" don't do well, and for good reason.

To be honest, I don't think there'd be a way to approach someone about it directly, but if you were getting to know someone with a disability you could start to gauge whether they'd appreciate some assistance getting out (I can never get enough help with that), and casually ask if they want to do something with you.  A more direct option would be to check out either organisations in your area that assist people with disabilities- I'm sure there would be PLENTY of grateful people there who would love a volunteer to give some company to the large number of lonely people in the community. Or you could look up forums directly online of illness that cause people to be in wheelchairs or whatever else you felt interested in helping with, and start by asking there how they would recommend you make such an offer- you would probably get some requests. The condition I have that makes me unable to walk is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (pots), mine is caused by Ehlers Danlos syndrome.

Assistance,3bttbm,almostnineam,-1,Thu Jul 2 02:26:42 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that between myself struggling to get the information out there and you trying to read between the lines, some wires were perhaps crossed. I'm sorry that your opinion is that I have poor financial management skills.   I received a large sum of money a year before the divorce began which my ex husband and I used to pay off all of our debts.  This was not a recent acquisition. I only mentioned it to highlight the fact that I had previously reached a point where I had no debt and was working on building my savings  prior to the divorce.   The loan was a personal loan from my credit union. Despite everything, I have pretty decent credit, and managed to secure a good rate. I explained what it was for, and they were able to help me. I hope to pay it back as soon as possible. I also was able to get approved for food stamps, so I can use some of my grocery budget to pay back the loan faster.   The children's summer clothing all came from a resale store called Once Upon A Child during a 50% off Sale. I didn't pay more than $1.50 for anything, but four outfits each for four kids is still substantial.   I have already worked my way up through the ranks in professional kitchens for cuisine, but I am currently working on a degree in baking and pastry so that, as ridiculous as you may think it sounds, I can have that little piece of paper with my name on it and a title. I'm using the GI Bill credits that my ex transferred to me prior to the divorce, which require me to go to school full time and make minimum grades. All of that will hopefully enable me to secure a decent job at the end of the year when I graduate.   This divorce is fairly fresh, but it was a very long and arduous process. I have known J for a very, very long time. The reasoning behind marrying so soon is complex - it allows him to proceed with his entrance into the military, which provides us with housing, income and insurance that we don't currently have. His son needs care that isn't covered by his current insurance but would be covered under the military health plan. We've both been married before and know what we do and do not want in a partner and relationship - this isn't a fanciful romanticized idea, it's a long, thought out and many times hashed over discussion.   You're right, wanting a $4k wedding with $9k debt is silly. I  know a great many sillier people my age.  I am trying to start a new life, with a new partner who treats me and my children with love and respect, welcoming in his children as my own. I wanted to celebrate it with our families and friends before we move to a new duty station and lose the opportunity forever. Mine is a family of tradition, and I wanted to share those wedding traditions with J and his children. I just wanted a pretty wedding with the man I plan on spending the rest of my life with, like every other girl.   If J and I go to the shitty little stuck-in-the-70s courthouse and just JOP it, it's really the end result that matters. I just figured that if you don't ask, the answer is always going to be no."

It sounds like you have some money management problems, ones I can empathise with because I went from being well-off to very low-income very abruptly. Some things in your post stood out to me:  ""I received a large sum of money... Unfortunately... the kids outgrew all of last year's summer clothes""  ...I know that there were a lot of other things in there, but that shouldn't even register. Kids' clothes are dirt cheap at thrift stores. They are also often available for free on freecycle, dirt cheap at garage sales, etc.   Being $9k in debt and hoping for a $4k wedding is a really, really bad idea. There is nothing wrong with going to the courthouse and having a reception in somebody's yard -- one of the nicest weddings I've ever been to was just that. (Conversely, my own US$50k-in-90s-dollars shindig was not that memorable.) It's really not on to expect other people to finance a party for you. If you really want to get married ASAP, do it on the cheap, and plan a fancy tenth anniversary party or some such.  Is there really a rush to get married, though? It's hard to read between the lines here but it kinda sounds like the divorce is still pretty fresh and the boyfriend might be relatively new? Blended families are hard work, and relationships forged under difficult circumstances are also really hard work. You want to start off on the best foundation possible, and your still dealing with custody/divorce hassles, the mental health fall-out, etc -- it doesn't sound like waiting would be a bad idea. You were just hospitalized! I would take some time for you before taking time for a marriage. If he is the good guy you say he is, he will be totally fine with a long engagement. I don't quite understand the impetus to rush to the altar for the military's sake, but that seems like an extremely bad idea, rushing a marriage for external reasons like that.  Is it possible for you to switch to a school program with better job prospects so the earning burden is not on all him? The consensus in /r/AskCulinary and /r/KitchenConfidential seems to be that culinary school is fun if you want to do it, but not a route to a decent-paying kitchen job. Working your way up through the ranks is the usual path there.  A personal loan...like, from a payday lender? That's a terrible idea for a person already in debt. I would post all the details of every last little bit of this in /r/personalfinance, and let them tell you what you need to hear.  Good luck...!"

I searched for ""small bassinet"" at google images and I have never seen anything of the sort in Brazil, neither do we have yardsales here, people I have talked to, to ask for any sort of craddle to borrow, told me they simply threw it away, which I find absurd. That's the mainstream culture here and I feel really sorry for that. Craig's list is also unavailable here.  Moses type basket: I LOVED it, really, I have always seen these at tv programmes and always imagined to buy one for my baby but I never knew the name of it. Unfortunately, I guess that we don't have these here, but I will look at it again. Anyhow, I am also unable to buy something from the internet because my daughter will likely come before the shipment arrives.

My caseworker said I have to find housing on my own. One shelter called me back and said they didn't have a room available this week and I should check next week. I could try 211 again.

Things happen, and after you adopt that animal it's your responsibility. It's up to you now for its care. Before you take that animal home, inquire about its medical history first. Ask for vet records. If there are none, don't adopt from that person. Kittens especially are supposed to get sets of shots and fixed before they go to new homes.

Also, based on what the cop said earlier I didn't think they'd wanna help. I know it doesnt make sense, but that's what my mind thought was the best thing to do.

You have monthly dues, which goes to the organization, then you have your tournament fees which can range $50-75 a tournament and most people play 2 tournaments a month. Its crazy, and as I look around at these games we are in, there are hardly any minorities and since I lost my job and I can't really afford it anymore, I'm seeing why. My sons showcase team has 3 latinos, and 0 african american. My middle sons team has 2 latinos, and 1 mixed race. My daughters dance school had 2 latinos and 1 mixed race. I just started to ask myself why?? Yes I personally need assistance for my kids because I want them to stay active and out of trouble, but I think there is a bigger problem going on here."

My so plays league for free, cause my husband and I volunteer our time on the board.   Im just speaking from experience, but most scouts look at a person as an individual player, not the team.  You can also send scouts your kid playing in a game in any league.  CAPE leagues on the east coast have scouts, attending camps run by professional teams are also ways to get noticed.    There are more ways to play ball and get noticed.  They do look at your SAT scores, more than you batting average.  Why would they just want someone to go there to play ball?  heres a really good article on how to get a scholarship academically and still play baseball in college and get noticed there.  http://diycollegerankings.com/how-to-get-recruited-to-play-college-baseball/78/"
Assistance,3bl9e7,AppellofmyEye,5,Tue Jun 30 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"I think you need to clarify your priorities and reasons for participating. If your child has a real shot at a college scholarship, then these tournaments may be worth it, but don't conflate that with your desire to keep them out of trouble. There are plenty of things they can do to keep out of trouble (like get paying jobs) that would additionally help their chances at college. Admissions counselors love seeing work experience.  The inability to participate in these sports has to do with money, not race. As a minority, it is a pet peeve of mine when I see everything blamed on race. There is real institutional racism, but it isn't the cause for everything. In short, correlation isn't the same as causation.   (sorry for the mini-rant)"

So I know all about other things to keep them out of trouble, and we are utilizing them. He is not afraid of hard work. My point to all this involving race is baseball has become a rich kids sports, that minorities don't have the money to keep up to get exposure like the ""white"" kids. The minorities that do play are very well to do and afford to spend the thousands of dollars it cost to do so.   http://www.theplayerstribune.com/left-out/  I agree with you, about using the race card for everything, I don't use it lightly at all, but this is definitely a race situation, because it involves socioeconomic factors that hinder a large group of minorites from participating"

For our teams, we are able to get donations that get applied to their accounts. Also, sports is expensive no matter the race.  I am by no means well off and live in a very rural area....sports parents all over are facing similar struggles black, white, yellow, purple, blue.  It sucks and for those of us not in an upper tax bracket, we need to be more creative when it comes to fundraising."
Assistance,3bl9e7,Juliana59,2,Wed Jul 1 01:33:20 2015 UTC,"I have been on teams that have had corporate sponsors but they tend to be ""neighborhood"" teams that like to keep the same kids playing together regardless of talent, and like I said before my boys are good, and staying on teams like that hinders their growth, because they don't push themselves to get better, they get content where they are. Since you have a son that plays you understand the different levels of tournament teams and I don't want my kid to be a ""star"" player on a select or elite team (AA & AAA), I want him be a great player on a premier team (majors). That competition helps them work harder to get better to get their playing time, not cause daddy is the coach, and he wants little Johnny to be a shortstop. We do lots of fundraising, but its still not enough. My youngest is playing in a World Series in GA next week, our team raised enough money to cover the hotels for the week for each family, and I was blessed enough to receive donations from my friends and family to help cover gas, and food, but thats not always the case for everyone. I agree with you in general, it is a sports parent thing regardless of race, but if you take a look at the teams playing, lack of color seems to be an issue for the older showcase teams.

I had that opportunity a couple of times presented for my daughter with softball, but the reality was, we did not have the money to easily do it. You need to think outside the box in order for your son to be ""seen"".  There are other ways for that to happen than just the showcases.  I know this because we went through this with 3 of them....stepson in football, stepdaughter in track & field, daughter in softball.  Start getting onto those college websites, get into the athletics area and click on that ""prospective student athlete"" form and fill it out.  Start getting onto the college websites and look to see what camps are being offered (as well as Nike and Under Armor) and take him to those....plenty of coaches at those.  Pay for a recruiter service if you feel he is that talented. Yes it is a bit expensive (we did it with my stepson) but it got his name out there and when we were at combines and camps, they knew who he was and were able to gather info alot quicker in addition to colleges coming to him as well.

Your performance gets playing time, not how much your mommy and daddy donate.  As far as his high school team goes its very political no matter what they say. The activity fee to play on the high school varsity team was $225, plus the uniforms another $250.  That seems to be excessive in my opinion. They allowed us to split the payments but thats as far as it goes.  Booster club donation gets your Freshman on a Varsity team over other deserving upper classmen.

If you can drive, you should be able to catch a flight to Latrobe or Baltimore and drive the four hours or so to get back to West Virginia. From what I saw there is a flight itinerary to Baltimore from Vegas and back for about 335 dollars, and if you get a rental car to make the travel from the airport to WV and back simpler it's another couple hundred dollars. It will definitely cost more than 500, but it's likely cheaper than trying to fly straight there.  Another option, flying into Latrobe and driving west, would really cut costs even further and make for a better trip overall. The cheapest flights from Vegas to Latrobe and back seem to be on the order of 100 dollars, and you can probably drive back and forth in a rental car for another $200 since it's only about a two hour drive.  While unfortunately I can't donate money at this time, I hope that this little bit of research helps you save money on your trip.  If you can't drive there may be bus services that can take you, or you could try to charter a taxi ahead of time, even though 88 miles from the Latrobe airport to Wheeling is pretty far for a taxi to drive.

Plus, the owner will still receive the subsidized portion of the rent, so they will be able to make most of their mortgage payment from that."

Assistance,3bgnqb,Girlpirate,2,Mon Jun 29 17:22:15 2015 UTC,Call your bank first thing in the morning. Most banks offer their customer's protection from fraud/unauthorized charges. Every bank I've ever used has credited my account right away and refunded any overdraft fees charged due to fraud. They'll probably want to cancel your bank card and send you a new one to prevent the company from continuing to charge you.
Assistance,3bgnqb,evylllint,3,Mon Jun 29 03:19:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure how helpful someone giving you the money would be. PayPal takes a few days to transfer to your bank account and by that time you'll already potentially be overdrafted.  What bank do you use? If it's a major one, they all should have a 24/7 customer line that you should call since emailing is never as efficient as picking up the phone and talking to someone. Ask them to maybe decline all uber charges, and report those unverified charges as potential theft and unauthorized by you. Open an investigation, this is absolutely important to make a big deal about. No one should be allowed to just take money from your account like that."

It's great to want to be independent, but I won't do anything to cut off financial help from your parents, until you are 100% SURE you will be able to afford it.  Why do you think you're falling out of favor with your family? Is there anything you can do to improve the situation, or at least remain status quo and not have them follow through with the threat? You're not living with them, so if all it takes is verbally agreeing to something they say, I say, do it for the $600 a month. I know how hard it can be to ""let someone win"", so to speak, but sometimes it might be something you have to do for better future. I endured 2 years of terrible landlords because the rent was dirt cheap - wasn't fun, but at least it allowed me to pay off my debt a lot quicker.  I mean, you said you want to be done with college so you can start getting a real job. So instead of focusing on the negative things your family's putting you through, think of it as them helping you get to where you want to be. I imagine it would be far worse if you end up not being able to complete your education because you ran out of fund to support yourself. Also, if you are serious about this web-comic business, then be more aggressive about it. Promote it beyond /r/Assistance. I can imagine people wanting to fish out X dollars a month to read something they like, but not so much to help pay someone else's monthly expenses, you know? Finally, I don't know much about the working life in US, but is there any way for you to find a part-time job that doesn't require minimum hours? Like, being on-call waiter/tress or something? Or something on campus? Take drawing commissions?"
Assistance,3ba7wi,mhtyhr,-1,Sat Jun 27 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"To address points individually:  Falling out of Favor   My family (or at least the part of it spending the money) has never really liked me. They've made it adamantly clear that they don't respect me, my dreams, or my opinions and it's been this way for years. The only reason they support me is because I'm working towards a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) degree which leads to very lucrative job opportunities. All they really care about is having a successful offspring (which I presume they wish to either live vicariously through or extort, but I can't say I have strong evidence for either yet).  It's never been as simple as ""work towards degree -> get support"". If they could, they'd micromanage every aspect of my life. If I were still living with them, I'd never be allowed to do anything other than study. Usually, I end up hiding most of my personal life away from them. Even then, they're always issuing threats and ultimatums over the tiniest things. Do this. Do that. Don't do this. Don't do that. Obey our every whim or we'll stop supporting you. While the threats almost always end up being all bark and no bite, it's still obscenely stressful and panic-inducing.   Letting them ""win""   I've been putting up with this pretty much all my life. Overbearing, abusive, and flat-out manipulative family. Thanks to that, I went through a period of about 4-5 years of extremely suicidal depression that was never formally diagnosed or treated because I literally had no one to turn to about it. I only really survived that thanks to art as a modus operandi towards catharsis. It's more of a bandage job, though. I still swing back into those lows time to time. While I say it's been mostly ""all bark and no bite"", they have done some genuinely nasty things to me over the years. It's seemingly random and pattern-less but it's a threat all the same. For example, I once almost had my laptop ripped in half for having the gall to surf the internet instead of spending that moment studying. The fact I'm putting myself through college on pure debt is actually a relatively new one. When I first started college, they paid for it out of pocket. And then they decided that, instead of paying tuition upfront in a lump sum, they'd have me take out loans that they'd pay off gradually. It made sense because, at the time, they were retired and, while relatively wealthy on good benefits and investments, were still working on less income. But they either never did or never did it for long as I recently learned I'm up to $24k+ in loan debt. I'm not going to call that heinous but it's certainly demonstrative of... something. A something that really only furthers my anxiety.   On comics   I've been taking a stab at promoting and marketing myself and my comics but I guess I'm just not aggressive enough at it. Or, it's probably just that I'm not good enough at art and story-making to warrant earning money for it. Or maybe people just don't like the fact I'm open about my situation and perceive it as panhandling for pity money (this was one of many reasons I lost a good friend). I don't know.   Alternate income   Current minimum wage in Colorado is about $8/hr. If I were to make the $600/mo, I'd need to work ~75 hours per month, or ~18.75 hours per week. There just really isn't a minimum wage opportunity that would allow me to meet that monthly figure on a very low number of hours. It's all on me for this point but I don't see myself handling a full college load if I'm working more than... 8-10 hours per week. And the only way I could make that figure on that few hours is if I were paid more than twice the minimum wage. As far as art commissions go, I offer them but have only ever gotten 3 in my life. Same three concerns as stated above under comics.   TL;DR: I have crappy family, I'm bad at life, and am having a difficult time attempting to cope and adapt because I am a ball of anxiety and depression and a bunch of other things. Therefore, I'm merely reaping what I've sown and, in my discontent with the harvest, am grasping at the straws of charity because I can't stand on my own two legs. It's frustrating.  (Am I being too critical?)"
Assistance,3ba7wi,mhtyhr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"AFAIK you don't need to start repaying school loan until you graduate. Find out how much you are borrowing exactly. Check if any payment has ever been made, don't assume they did or did not. After that, have a good chat with your parents about their thought on repayment plan. Maybe they will finally tell you ""Screw you pay it on your own"". Either way, you will know for sure. It doesn't do you any good to be anxious about it. Just face it up front.     Or maybe people just don't like the fact I'm open about my situation and perceive it as panhandling for pity money   I find that people generally dislike to be put in a situation where they feel helpless. Some people handle it better than others. Maybe they just, for whatever reason, cannot justify spending money on you, and don't know how to react with anything other than avoidance.  Finally, I think you can be as critical of yourself as you want, as long as you recognize that ultimately you are in-charge of your life. Some people get lucky and have others who they could count on, and some don't. If you don't, it just means you're gonna have to be extra... vigilant (for lack of a better word).  Is a crappy family who is giving you some kind of financial support but with abuse better than no family? I don't know - that's for you to answer.   I am happy to be proven wrong, but I honestly don't think you'll get much help with your request here.  Just have a look at the first  2 pages of requests posted here, and see which ones get fulfilled and you'll get an idea.    I won't stop you from asking for help here, that's your right. But I would strongly advise you don't count on this campaign being succesfull, and instead, make sure you have alternative plans.  You seem to be really good at managing your money. Saving $10k in a year for a 24-year-old is no easy feat. If you really don't want to keep taking money from your parents, then maybe you can consider quitting college to work full time. And one day, when you have saved up enough, you can think about going back again."
Assistance,3ba7wi,mhtyhr,-2,Sun Jun 28 02:39:00 2015 UTC,"Whoops, looks like I forgot to mention that I found out I was in debt the $24k+ because, during one of our ""casual"" phone conversations, they very briefly mentioned not paying for college, something that was news to me. I checked the loan overview and, sure enough there was the $24k+. It's still the case that l don't know if they paid any of it or not (if that's the full debt or just part of it).  You are correct in that it's not as big of a deal but, to me, it still illustrates their methodology in handling me. It's not like they brought it up as soon as they stopped (or never started). Based on tuition costs that I know, this has been going on for at least a couple years now. I have a hard time not seeing that as intentionally malicious. I know that it's also partly on me for not being vigilant in keeping an eye on the loan overview myself but it's really something that never came to mind. I was never really prepared for adult life and responsibility.  I admit that I tend to be very non-confrontational. I've tried being confrontational but they simply just don't listen to me because I'm me. So, I guess I sort of learned to not even bother trying to reason with them.  Maybe I'm alone in the sentiment but I feel that mental health is a high priority. They are damaging to my mental health and I don't know if I can put up with it for the rest of my university time. Furthermore, I can't even guarantee they'll continue to pay my living bills. It's very hard to focus on academics (or anything, really) when my brain is a complete anxious mess.  I'm hardly counting on anybody or anything. I'm just grasping at any possible opportunity and hoping for the best. There's not much I can do in regards to alternative plans.  I've always been saving money. Ever since I was a kid with a weekly $1 allowance. For some reason, I have a hard time spending money outside of being charitable to others. I had about $3k in savings just by saving gift and allowance money for most of my life. The other ~$7k came from working my internship. I've spent SOME money on myself somehow in this time but it really isn't much in comparison to what I've made.  I don't know if I didn't quite convey it properly or whatever but it's simply the case that I cannot put off college. As I stated in the OP, I'm a type-1 diabetic. What this means is that I need a lot of expensive medical stuff to basically keep my body in a proper condition (things like insulin, insulin pump equipment, blood glucose test strips, glucometers, lancets [tiny needles], etc). I also have to regularly go to endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and whatever else. In order to cover most all of those costs, I need to have insurance. At the moment, I'm covered under my family's insurance. When I turn 26 (~2 years from now), I won't be. I'll have to insure myself. From my research, I cannot easily afford this for any significant period of time.  The biggest problem with insuring myself is the deductible --what I have to pay out of pocket before insurance kicks in. Based on what I've seen, the lowest deductible I can probably get is a couple thousand dollars. Every year, I'd have to pay for ~$2k of my medical expenses out of pocket. If I quit college to work, minimum wage would NOT easily cover that, especially since I'd have higher other living expenses to address --my current rent of $485/mo is utility-free and student-only so, if I quit college, I'd have to move elsewhere. The lowest I've seen elsewhere in rent is $500 and that excludes utilities. Simply put, cost of living is too damn high for me to quit.  No, I cannot return to my internship if I quit college. The company specifically takes on interns who are in college and going to graduate ""soon"".  So, I guess to reiterate why I'm here: I don't have much choice in the matter. I have to graduate from college in about 2 years' time. I cannot reasonably hold a ""real"" job and meet this criterion. College tuition itself is not a factor here. The factor is paying for rent, food, and Internet. Family currently pay this. However, I cannot see myself enduring their psychological abuse for 2 more years in exchange for that. Furthermore, I cannot find rationality in assuming they'll even continue to pay those bills as our relationship continues to deteriorate further.  I'm here asking for assistance in amassing enough monthly funding to be able to pay these bills myself and not have to deal with uncertainty and abuse.  I'm not asking that any singular person donate a lot of money. I'm asking if a lot of people would all individually donate some chump change each month.  I'm not asking for blind charity. I'm offering something in exchange. It might not be a great something in everybody's eyes but it's still an honest effort to repay kindness."

Assistance,3b48hq,scsibusfault,-5,Thu Jun 25 21:49:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry, let me clarify the bad wording. In total from the money she cashed from my paychecks, she made over $5000. My parents are divorced, and even though I don't live with my mother she still has the child support payments sent to her. I've asked her how to change it so it's sent to me but she refuses to tell me, and navigating how to do it online is nigh impossible. I don't know how to do it without her consent or a lawyer."
Assistance,3b48hq,Girlpirate,8,Thu Jun 25 21:54:46 2015 UTC,This confuses me and I don't understand how it works. At 19 years old you are legally an adult and responsible for yourself... why would you receive child support for yourself?
Assistance,3b48hq,Girlpirate,-2,Thu Jun 25 22:11:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a college student, so my father is still obligated by the state to pay child support. If I wasn't a student then he wouldn't have to, though."
Assistance,3b48hq,Girlpirate,3,Thu Jun 25 22:14:19 2015 UTC,"Then you need to contract the state directly. Your mother is no longer supporting you, so her keeping those funds is fraud. Show them your school paperwork, lease, etc to prove you're on your own and they should be able to redirect it to you and instruct you how to go about getting any back funds you're owed.  Also contact the counselor at your school and ask about programs to help you financially. Apply for FAFSA if you haven't already.  Food pantries are also a great resource. There are 60+ in your county. Google your city and ""food pantry"" to find ones close to you."

So on the $10,000 example he'd still need 3 grand in excess..  We have been discussing pet insurance and I think he'd get some, but this would cover the excess or things that aren't covered.

If so, what was your EFC? It had to be close to zero with the income you list.

Assistance,3az4eu,nuvistor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:17:52 2015 UTC,"www.caricature.org is a good source .... the hot tip is to use ""card stock"" which is expensive at an art store but dirt cheap by the ream (144 sheets) from an office supply. Use black Prismacolor pencil on this, then color in with ""Art Stix"" which are made by Prismacolor, Prismacolor pencils themselves, or pastels .... one popular way to do color is to use ""pad pastels"" with a cotton glove, you get a nice airbrushed effect.   There are tons of helpful and informative people in the caricature game, and most people do not want an exaggerated caricature, they want much closer to a portrait. He'll find himself drawing lots of kids and young couples. Having a sign saying he can also do pictures from the picture in someone's phone (everyone's got kid and significant other pix) will really boost sales.

Assistance,3axx1k,danybravo13,9,Wed Jun 24 11:37:46 2015 UTC,"The best thing to do starts with self-awareness and understanding. Understand that your possessive feelings aren't actually about her, or even necessarily about the guys paying attention to her.    It's about you.    You've met and fallen for this wonderful person, for whom you obviously care very deeply. She's agreed to be in a relationship with you, so now you have this awesome thing you didn't have, before.    Quite understandably, you're afraid of losing that awesome thing, the relationship you have with this wonderful person. That's pretty normal, really. It's an extremely common insecurity for many people in relationships.    What you need to understand, though, is that those fears and insecurities are yours, not anyone else's, and they are therefore your responsibility. Not your girlfriend's, not the guys who worry you.    Also, you have to understand, deep down, not just in your on-top brain, is that she is a person, not a thing that you can possess, own, or control. She has her own mind, her own feelings, her own rights, her own agency. And with all of those things at her disposal, she CHOSE to be with you. So, she's given you reason both to respect her autonomy, and to trust her decisions.    Trying to control her actions, in order to address feelings that are your responsibility, will likely only lead to pushing her away. Discussing and dealing with your feelings in a mature, personally responsible, self-aware fashion will be much more likely to create a stronger, deeper bond, and a more secure relationship."

Assistance,3awnee,CynicKitten,2,Wed Jun 24 02:32:28 2015 UTC,"This happened to my girl years ago as well. 4yr old rat, got a large tumor, paid $200 to have it removed... lived for another 1.5 years even though it returned after a year. 5 years is a LONG life for a rat, so I didn't bother putting her through the surgery the second time, especially since everything I'd been told is that the tumors are relatively benign and other than probably being massively uncomfortable, don't seem to otherwise affect the rat.   Unless the vet has told you otherwise, my guess is that it isn't critical you have it operated on immediately, so at least you've probably got some time to raise the money for it. I'll chip in a bit when I get to the office in memory of my girl :) She lives on in eternity as one of my most popular selling stock photos!"

Assistance,3awnee,scsibusfault,2,Wed Jun 24 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply! Yeah, it is nice that most are benign - I know these ones are because they are easily isolated. But unfortunately, they are growing quite rapidly, which will eventually kill them if left as they are (Bumble is having trouble walking already). :c  It's great to hear about your rat! What a lovely, long life. May I ask how you dealt with her non-removed tumor? Did it eventually kill her, or did she die naturally of death? I just don't want them to suffer, so I want the best advice for how to handle it. Obviously I should get them euthanized if I can't get them surgery and it becomes a hassle, but I've never had to euthanize a pet and am not sure when I would need to.   Thank you. :3"
Assistance,3awnee,scsibusfault,2,Wed Jun 24 17:54:54 2015 UTC,"Also, side note, I paid around $200 for my surgery. I know it was almost 10 years ago and prices have gone up, but you MIGHT be able to work out a deal with a good vet to get the price down closer to that. Maybe even only a little bit more if you could possibly have them perform the work on both rats at once (not sure if that makes it easier, but some places will work out a package deal).   Also, many MANY good vets will let you put things on a payment plan, which is honestly your best option here. Offer them $50-100 upfront, and maybe $25/month. You'll have it paid off in no time, and your girls will get the help they need."
Assistance,3awnee,scsibusfault,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"I am applying to vet school this summer, so I volunteer at a local vet's office. They give me a discount, which is awesome. Sarabi's surgery was around $240 after medication. Unfortunately, since they are newly opened up, they can't give me a payment plan and need the cost the day of the surgery. But because I get such a good deal (I've compared their prices with all of the clinics that do rats in the two cities I live in) it ends up being so much cheaper."
Assistance,3awnee,Hashtaglibertarian,2,Wed Jun 24 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"how you dealt with her non-removed tumor   Honestly, it was hard to tell. She was 5 and a half years old - avg expectancy for a caged rat is 4yrs. The vet actually recommended I not remove the tumor when she was 4 because it was already estimated she didn't have long left anyway. I have no idea how she managed to push another year and a half, after surgery, with another giant lump on her. I like to think she appreciated me and wanted to stick it out as long as possible! I think it was more old age that got her. She used to sleep inside a sock (would chew out the toe and turn it into a tube and then wriggle in like a sleeping bag), and that's where I found her one morning looking reasonably peaceful.  I think if you've had the rats awhile, long enough to know their usual personalities, you may be able to tell if they're 'off', which would be the best indicator of how much pain they're in. Animals don't generally show pain responses like humans, but they'll do odd things - not eat as often, not be as excited for treats, maybe not grind their teeth as much when you scratch them (if yours do that... kind of like cat purring). If that kind of thing starts happening, then yes - you'd want to look into surgery or euthanasia, and probably fairly quickly unfortunately. Tiny animals go from bad to worse in a surprisingly short amount of time, sometimes as little as a day :(   The saddest part about my rat was, I somehow developed an allergy to her after about 4 years. I'd never had an issue, or any allergies at all, but after about 4 years, any time her claws touched my skin, she'd leave red bumps and welts for hours afterward. Worse if I happened to rub my eyes. I ended up actually keeping a pair of rat-gloves just to handle her for a while, she loved to snuggle up my sleeves and would just purr contentedly for hours.    I'm happy to answer anything else if you feel it'd be helpful. Best of luck to you!"

Assistance,3awnee,mathgod,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:39:54 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, yes. I think originally she had a very tall cage, 3 or 4 levels high with ladder-ramps. I switched it out for a shorter, wider cage with maybe only 2 levels, and either denser wire mesh or solid plastic so that she had an easier time climbing. Walking across ridged plastic ramps was easier than climbing wire ladders, I believe.   I think I also switched out from shavings to that fabric/cotton fuzzy bedding. I don't think I was ever using cedar, which I believe is bad for them, but I figured the cottony stuff would be overall easier on her."

Assistance,3ay698,geological-tech,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:53:36 2015 UTC,"Hi Geological,  I just wanted to reply regarding the above. In regards to getting a loan, I have already looked up my possibilities of a loan, and I am eligible to get a loan of £1000, which does cover some of the tuition costs, but would still leave me a with a shortfall.  My family will give what they can, but as I have mentioned, I would want my father to focus on treatment and getting better, rather than if I have enough money to pay for my course.  Although deferring entry to most would mean they get more time with their family, actually be deferring a year, I would see my family less during this time, as I would need to continue working my full-time job. At least by starting my Masters course, I would have a greater flexibility to be able to return home if and when needed. Also, my father would not want me to put off my Masters for another year, although he always wanted me to be a lawyer, he knows how passionate I am about getting my Masters, and knows my love for psychology. He also knows that tuition fees are likely to go up again next year, which would put me in a worse position.  Plus, by doing my Masters now, my father is more likely to see me graduate, than deferring a year, and remove all hope of this happening."

If you don't like them, don't join that fraternity.   Edit: dues can get expensive. If that might become an issue, speak to the treasurer/frat advisor to see if there's something that might be worked out. Many frats also offer scholarships that not many people apply for."

If they're large orgs with a nationwide presence, they'll have scholarships you can apply for once you've joined. Rush should be free. If I remember correctly, my dues were approx $700 per semester.

Most colleges include a bus pass in tuition that allows students to ride for free with a valid student ID.  Also, if he needs to drive 35 miles to and from school, that's 70 miles a day.

They want to make sure that when you come here its not to just ask for money,  People who do donate on these sites do so for people that are in danger of going hungry or sometimes a life or death situation.

Usually in a bankruptcy, people's homes are protected from foreclosure.  You said your mom has been with him since 93, if she's spent a number of years with him, and he is retired military, she is entitled to a portion of his retirement.  He doesn't get to decide if she is entitled to it or not, the government does.  If he's been paying into a 401K, she's entitled to a large percentage of that as well.  I am a little surprised about the compulsive liar thing.  Usually people with that don't do well in the military.

I think when this whole process began 3 wereks ago, she looked into legal aid and for some reason or other she did not qualify. I will have her look into it again. She is self-employed as a realtor. We are not from this area and she is fairly new at it, so, it's been slow-going. She doesn't make much money from it, at all. That is why I give her what I can from my earnings, while still supporting my son. The biggest issue we are facing right now is trying to find the divorce, pay all our regular bills, and fix this house that has been dumped on us. We can't do it all without help, which is the reason for the GFM account.
