I do feel for these people and they should have been able to clear this up with a phone call and some records.   However this law exists for a very good reason. Still there should be a trial to prove the money was structured intentionally to avoid reporting before any money is seized. Maybe a temporary freeze on the accounts so they aren't emptied put.   You could freeze the assets and give them a loan for that amount to mount their defense that only needs to be paid back if the government wins. That way there is incentive for the government to be careful when applying this law and the money can't be emptied during trial.

Actual review need only occur in those rare instances where a hotel operator objects to turning over the registry.”   So they still aren't requiring a warrant, issued by a judge, based on probable cause, as the 4th amendment requires.  That's like a ""wink, wink"" from Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor to the police to go ahead and bully hotel owners into turning over their registries anyway...

It's long since been dead. Cops know the loopholes by now, and they use them all the time.  I bet you a billion dollars, in all but the 7th circuit, if you gave me a badge, I could search any home in the United States, at any time, without a warrant, without cause, I wouldn't even need an existing case. I would say a CI (which I don't have to reproduce) tipped me off, I showed up at the house to conduct a knock and talk. That's how confident I am.

Second, this isn't saying the court agreed to the administration's request. Tens of thousands of briefs get filed with the US Supreme Court asking them to ignore their own decisions (the Court's, that is).

restorethefourth,38np6g,ProfessorStupidCool,2,Fri Jun 5 20:49:40 2015 UTC,"The logic appears to be: ""if we remove ALL encrypted communications, terrorists will HAVE to use social media!"" which is almost as ridiculous as it is fallacious.  Do they intend to snatch up PGP-guy to compromise his standard?  The only terrorists on social media are idiots."
restorethefourth,38np6g,ProfessorStupidCool,2,Fri Jun 5 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"That didn't even seem to be the logic. He sounded worried about social media using encryption, and seemed to be glossing over the difference between ""social media"" using encryption to keep user-to-user private messages private, as opposed to general propaganda on Twitter feeds anyone can see.  “When a company, a communications company or a ISP or social media company elects to build in its software encryption, end-to-end encryption, and leaves no ability for even the company to access that, we don’t have the means by which to see the content”, he added.  “When we intercept it, we intercept encrypted communications. So that’s the challenge: working with those companies to build technological solutions to prevent encryption above all else."
restorethefourth,38np6g,uncletravellingmatt,2,Fri Jun 5 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"all I meant was that his assumption seems to be that social media is their ""best bet"", while PGP email is no secret, and obviously safer than ""encrypted"" social media (there is no free social media model that would incentivize true anonymity).  So whatever the logic of this is, his position is senseless - these ""terrorists"" are radicalized idiots, and no real enemy of anyone but themselves."

You're damn right I want end-to-end encryption, to keep you and every other nosey-ass, self-important government agency out of my business. Liberty is the greatest victim of terrorism, and taking away end-to-end encryption for the average citizen would be yet another victory for the bad guys. If only the lobby for citizens' privacy was as strong as that of the NRA. Could you imagine the FBI proposing to take away all guns just so the bad guys won't have guns? Like that would even work. Look, the FBI has an important and critical mission. But, to eliminate end-to-end encryption would be short-sited and counter-productive."

restorethefourth,38np6g,ProfessorStupidCool,3,Fri Jun 5 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"Unpossible.  Even if you made SSL connections illegal, the data itself could still be encrypted ahead of time.  And there's really no way to tell that it even has been.  Could be compiled code, or one sort of fragmented file or another.    All this would accomplish is making the average user much, much easier to hack.  (which also means our corporations ) And virtually nothing to stop people who they don't want using encryption from using it..."
restorethefourth,38np6g,Gr1pp717,3,Fri Jun 5 17:31:56 2015 UTC,"Unpossible.   Don't overestimate the technological solution and underestimate the power of tyrannical government. Once the government has outlawed encryption or established that only ""approved"" encryption where the government has the keys is legal, ISPs will be enlisted to help police their traffic for any ""rogue"" encrypted content. Violators will be prosecuted!  Sure, there will be a technological cat-and-mouse game trying to hide encrypted content, but an ISP seeing you send ""random"" data without the proper headers or without being in approved formats that let them decrypt it will be required to notify law enforcement. A good analogy of this is how banks are now required to report any transaction over $10,000, or any ""suspicious pattern"" of transactions under $10,000. ""When in doubt, report it!"" is the mantra that minimizes their liability.  A few high profile cases of folks getting lengthy jail sentences for encrypting is all it will take to make most people think twice before using encryption or other ""terrorist tools."""

Pirating seems to be a decent example of how legal deterrents aren't always all that effective.)  But those who need to send data will find a way to keep it from being noticed or readable -- which is really my point.  It wont stop the people we need to stop from encrypting, and merely make the rest of us vulnerable to hackers.    If I were in a position to need to illegally encrypt a message, I would add it as a string to some code that dumps the string to memory through a series of convoluted pointers on some specific event(s).  Automated detection wouldn't be able to pick it up, since it would look like any other compiled application -- and even if I were being monitored, people would simply find a normal, working application.  And that's just one way it could be hid..."

Passwords to anything are a thing of the past. Telecommunication devices will all share channels. All cabinets will solely be glass, homes must have a prescribed number of windows per square foot. Children found engaging in recreational games such as hide and seek will be sent straight to reformation camps for propagating such dangerous concepts to other impressionable youths. Anyone found with a decoder ring or similar device is to be sent to Guantanamo. People who are forgetful must also be interred as this is a form, albeit involuntary, of withholding information. Ultimately all grade school children must be enrolled in advanced training regimens which will render them incapable of any internal thought and will only be capable of thinking out loud."

""Increasing number""???  Any decent encrypted communications software ever uses end-to-end encryption - anything else is basically fake encryption. Acting like this is some sort of emerging trend is just playing into the government's fake narrative.  If anything the trend is towards caving into the government. Skype in 2003 used secure end-to-end encryption. Once it was bought by Microsoft, they switched to where now Microsoft can see everything and provide it to law enforcement."
restorethefourth,38np6g,zugi,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:26:41 2015 UTC,"The problem with preventing encryption is that the government can't stop someone from writing gibberish, so encryption is a form of individual expression.  So unless the government wants to pass a law requiring everyone to speak into the microphone in clear, Midwestern American English, they are gong to have a hard time preventing encryption."

Even if encryption was nonexistent this would remain the case. Hell, the 4th amendment originally made this the case by law in the absents of any technological barrier. Yet when you don't have to trust the government not to do what they aren't supposed to do it suddenly becomes a problem? Maybe the trust was the real problem?"

restorethefourth,38j27c,fuweike,21,Thu Jun 4 17:44:27 2015 UTC,"If you have a more up to date quote from Senator Paul on the issue, then I'd love to see it.  This is the most definitive statement from Paul I've seen on the issue of Snowden's legal status.   “Do I think that it's OK to leak secrets and give up national secrets and things that could endanger lives? I don't think that's OK,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” “But I think the courts are now saying that what he revealed was something the government was doing was illegal.”  Paul’s implication that Snowden’s ends justified his means yielded a call for leniency.  “I don't think Edward Snowden deserves the death penalty or life in prison. I think that's inappropriate. And I think that's why he fled, because that's what he faced,” he said. “I think the only way he's coming home is if someone would offer him a fair trial with a reasonable sentence.”   Source"
