Music,3dyql5,annoyingbeggar,1007,Mon Jul 20 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"In case the site goes down  Grooveshark co-founder Josh Greenberg, a pioneer in Gainesville’s student startup movement, was found dead in his bed Sunday by his girlfriend in the house they shared. He was 28.  Lori Greenberg, his mother, said Monday he had no health problems and she was told by police who investigated Sunday night that there was no evidence of foul play, injuries or drugs.  She said her son was more relieved than depressed about the settlement that shut down Grooveshark on April 30 since it ended the lawsuit that had been hanging over his head. Several record companies had sued the online music streaming service over copyright violations.  “He was excited about potential new things that he was going to start,” she said.  The medical examiner was performing an autopsy Monday morning and would know if there were obvious problems with Greenberg’s heart or brain, otherwise, toxicology results would be done in two or three months, Lori Greenberg said.  “They are as baffled as I am,” she said.  Josh Greenberg’s girlfriend, Abby Mayer, was away for the weekend and returned to find his body.  “It looked like he was sleeping,” Lori Greenberg said.  Greenberg and Sam Tarantino founded Grooveshark as 19-year-old freshmen at the University of Florida in March 2006. At its peak, the company had up to 40 million users a month and 145 employees, occupying most of the second floor of the Union Street Station in downtown Gainesville and a small office in New York City.  Greenberg helped train other entrepreneurs and computer programmers to get their start in the tech industry through Grooveshark University classes, the Summer with the Sharks internship program and as a partner in the Founders Pad business incubator.  He started MaidSuite with Student Maid founder Kristen Hadeed to provide an online scheduling application for cleaning companies and other service providers and recently helped start the Gainesville Dev Academy to offer computer programming training. He was a founding member of the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce’s Gainesville Technology Council.  In addition to his mother, Greenberg is survived by his younger brother, Jacob, and grandparents, Jerry and Sandy Greenberg. Lori Greenberg, who lives in St. Petersburg, said Josh’s friends would be arranging a memorial service in Gainesville."

I have heard accusations of abuse about him toward my sister, so he may not be blameless, but he didn't kill her. It was asthma and maybe alcohol or pain pills. He has a job now, and has lost a lot of weight. I hope his life gets better, and I hope he stays off the streets.  My sister lived a hard life. My dad is raising her son. His dad has visitation too, shared custody, but he is with my dad most of the time. I'm glad my dad quit smoking years ago. My sister's mom didn't, and now she's got lung cancer.  Tough all around.

I think it hit him as soon as I walked into the room because I just saw him slump a bit(like he was disappointed that I was at his house) when I said hi, and then his head started bobbing weird so I knew something was wrong.    I ran over to him and started calling for my grandma to call 911.  I can remember thinking how he was going to yell at me because I was making a big deal about him just slipping or something.  The look on his face... It was so scared; something I had never seen on his face.  I can remember how frail and light he felt as I carefully took him from the little room; how he kept trying to help with his right leg but it was just meaninglessly flailing.  I pulled him out and I used the wall to sit down.  He ended up laying with his head on my chest between my legs with his back on my chest.  We looked each other in the face; eye to eye.  Then they unfocused and he urinated.  I got up and went to the front door to let the paramedics in knowing he was gone."

Huge weight lifter with a complete gym in his parent's basement.  His mother came home and did some laundry then cooked dinner. She saw the basement light on and heard his workout music so she made enough for him as well. She placed the food on the table and went to go get Stephen so he could eat.   When she got to the bottom of the steps, she found him on the bench press with the barbell across his neck.  At fifty plus years old, and weighing all of 120 lbs, she couldn't move the weights (200+ lbs) off of her son.

Music,3dyql5,StuPickles40122,33,Mon Jul 20 20:02:14 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, if your legs feel uncomfortable and it's a blood clot it's already too late.  That said, just get up every 1 or 2 hours, just for a few seconds to a minute. Grab a glass of water, take a piss. It really doesn't have to be much at all. You're only really at risk at 7+ hours anyway, but no reason to put yourself at risk in the first place, so just every 1 or 2 hours!"

Lori Greenberg, his mother, said Monday he had no health problems and she was told by police who investigated Sunday night that there was no evidence of foul play, injuries or drugs.  She said her son was more relieved than depressed about the settlement that shut down Grooveshark on April 30 since it ended the lawsuit that had been hanging over his head. Several record companies had sued the online music streaming service over copyright violations.  “He was excited about potential new things that he was going to start,” she said.   Unless he was hiding a lot from his own mother (or, I suppose, she could be hiding a lot from us for some reason), it sounds like he was in a perfectly healthy mental state."

Music,3dyql5,bazoos,6,Mon Jul 20 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"Whoa... sad to see such a tragic ending for a site that I used daily for nearly 7 years... Grooveshark was one of a kind when it came to the variety of music you could find and easily listen to (without having to worry about seeders for obscure torrents). It's nearly impossible to find lots of the video game and non-English music it had, and the extensive public user playlist database was a goldmine for discovering new stuff. In 2015 it felt like a relic of a different age before DMCA was really enforced and Youtube/Spotify hadn't made filesharing services obsolete. I hope one day in another legal climate a site like it can exist again. From what a read there was a lot of drama and anxiety behind the site, with employee conflicts and shady business, so this news isn't that  surprising."
Music,3dyql5,bge,9,Mon Jul 20 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"I listen to music pretty rarely (yeah I know weird) and Grooveshark was perfect for me.  Much better than just bookmarking all my favorite songs in YouTube.  It didn't make sense for me to pay monthly for a music service I might not use every month.  It was great.  Also had tons of obscure music and would let me upload my own obscure music when you couldn't find it anywhere else.  As a programmer, I also really admired the sophistication of the site.  It was a fully functioning web app with great performance long before that was ever a thing.  One of the first Flash sites to make a successful translation to HTML5 long before it was even a solid standard.  There aren't any really good alternatives and the music industry is even starting to go after apps that are essentially just YouTube players.  I basically just don't listen to music now and it sucks.  Will miss Grooveshark and I think the cofounder's death is a great loss for the programming community."

But a lot of what didn't instantly match is going to be pretty hard to track down. A lot of smaller bands that only had limited releases or attention for example. Though one of the more annoying parts of that is the fact that I even legally owned CDs from many of them. Just managed to lose them over the years.

Music,3dxtq6,Slip_Freudian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:15 2015 UTC,Joe Walsh deserves a solo spot in the Rock n' Roll HOF.  Also - his story in The Eagles movie is really heart-warming.  Eagles split (orginal) and Joe goes off the rails with booze.  Eagles reform for Hell Freezes Over tour and Joe basically says - shit - that's reason enough to sober up.  Sober since.

Music,3dxtq6,GTE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:21 2015 UTC,I just listened to this- never heard it before. It's pretty cool.   I took my headphones off and could hear it again. Someone waiting in traffic in the road below my flat was playing it on their car stereo! Woah.

Music,3dxtq6,drummerandrew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:40:56 2015 UTC,You gotta check out the live version from the cross roads festival. Joe Walsh is such a character on stage. They start off a slow blues jam and the transition into funk 49 is just so sweet.  edit: forgot the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3lEqVAroX4
