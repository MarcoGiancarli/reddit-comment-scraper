Muse,3e3vsk,michaelt4,2,Tue Jul 21 21:46:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with Revolt being a closer, except I think Soaked should be the opener.   And can we have some pure hearts in there as well, even though there is no soul?"
Muse,3e3vsk,JLAwesome1,3,Tue Jul 21 19:42:40 2015 UTC,"Soaked would be an interesting opener, but it's in chronological order so that's why it's Showbiz-Revolt.  The last chorus of Revolt can spontaneously break into Guiding Light :)"
Muse,3e3vsk,GeddyLeesGlasses,2,Tue Jul 21 19:48:29 2015 UTC,"Most of these songs are my favorites of theirs and regarded as the best... so all Matt has to do is add ""soul"" to every song from here on out! I'm a fucking genius."

Muse,3e2nf7,shoegraze,11,Tue Jul 21 14:14:15 2015 UTC,"Matt Mahurin would be better suited making artwork for bands like Disturbed or Volbeat. This is so shallow and literal.   In his defense though, I am sure he probably didn't bother to listen to the song before he did the artwork."
Muse,3e2nf7,AnalrapistOnDuty,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:27 2015 UTC,He only had the lyrics to work with I believe.
Muse,3e2nf7,jlight119,7,Tue Jul 21 19:54:41 2015 UTC,His artwork for drones was such a letdown. Thankfully the music wasn't a letdown at all.
Muse,3e2nf7,WaterPokemon,6,Tue Jul 21 16:49:57 2015 UTC,Not sure this fits the actual sound of the uplifting poppy song.
Muse,3e2nf7,thisriveriswild57,9,Tue Jul 21 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"Looking at this art while listening to the song is an absurd experience, it's so off.   I hate this art to begin with, but in context of the song it's just so much worse."

Muse,3e2p8l,DaMangaka,10,Tue Jul 21 14:28:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but Matt said that handler was connected to showbiz song."
Muse,3e2p8l,vorlok,4,Tue Jul 21 14:33:51 2015 UTC,"Huh, I missed that one. Is it Showbiz itself or a song from Showbiz?"
Muse,3e2p8l,smith2681,6,Tue Jul 21 14:35:29 2015 UTC,"Matt said that the lyrics to The Handler are ""almost a question and answer with that song"" (in reference to the track Showbiz), but in the song, the only line that can be connected with Showbiz's theme is ""I won't let you control my feelings anymore"" as there's a line almost similar to that in Showbiz.  EDIT: Musically, the middle section of The Handler does have a familiar feel to Showbiz."
Muse,3e2p8l,sidious911,7,Tue Jul 21 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"Well.. Matt did say that The Globalist is the sequel to CE, so I doubt that he told everyone the wrong song. As mentioned, Matt also said the Handler had a connection with Showbiz."
Muse,3e2p8l,smith2681,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"Matt said that the song (CE) was almost a description of what it's like to always be questioned, and to only be able to give answers based on current knowledge and that something always comes along to make you disagree with what you said - almost like you lied per say. The lyrics do paint that kind of picture, especially..   ""Teach us to cheat, And to lie, and cover up, What shouldn't be shared, And the truth's unwinding, Scraping away at my mind, Please stop asking me to describe""   The Handler is all about, as you said, the protagonist of the album wanting to escape from those controlling him. However, I do believe that The Handler connects more with the track Showbiz than Citizen Erased. (another possible connection to Showbiz lyric ""Controlling my feelings for too long"").  So, in my opinion, I don't agree with your theory, looking at what's in front of me lyric wise and using Matt's descriptions of the songs."
Muse,3e2p8l,Zatharel,2,Tue Jul 21 14:49:11 2015 UTC,"Globalist is the sequel.  ""A trillion memories Lost in space and time forevermore""  Adds up to erasing the memories of the people in CE."
Muse,3e2p8l,Sonicvolcano,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"Matt meant lyrically a sequel, not musically."
Muse,3e2p8l,Forhavu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:39 2015 UTC,I believe it is very much lyrically a sequel! I don't see how so many people disagree about the Globalist hitting on the same story.

Muse,3e17aq,TheCelloIsAlive,6,Tue Jul 21 04:13:26 2015 UTC,Probably late this year/early next year. Between the Mexican dates in November and the European Arena Tour which I think they said would start in February or March.

Muse,3e17aq,nachodroids,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"Judging by how spread out the current tour dates are (Asia Sept 19th-30th, South America through Oct 15th-27th, Mexico Nov 17th-20th) I don't think they'd be able to fit in any more arena dates just based on logistics. Pending if they take the full arena set up (the possible 360 stage) to Asia, then the two weeks between there and South America would be transporting the stage across the ocean.*** Not to mention these arena tour dates were announced awhile ago to give time for ticket sales, North American tour dates would need the same amount of time.  That being said, there is the gap between South America and Mexico (nearly 3 weeks). Hopefully they might take some of that, even just a week, and toss in some more small shows across North America just for fun. They don't need to be announced very early in advanced, they could ship the arena stage to Mexico/store it in the trucks for those weeks and just take the gear rigs and a small lighting set-up and play a handful of dates. This is all just a hopeful dream though, I really want to see them play a small show in Canada so they bring back Glorious to the country it was played most in! (Yeah, I'm selfish, so what!)  ***EDIT: Upon further research it looks like the dates in Asia and South America will be with some sort of thrust stage set up (Perhaps close to the scaled back festival stage) and the ""360 stage"" won't debut until Mexico City. Possibly being built somewhere in North America this time, which would explain that random contest that popped up while ago to see the band in San Francisco at a ""dress rehearsal"" for the upcoming tour."
Muse,3e17aq,Patcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:54 2015 UTC,Is there anything concrete that indicates that the 360 stage is a thing? I thought that had been pretty well debunked as old/not applicable to Drones-era touring. A reject concept from a past tour or something.
Muse,3e17aq,Neongreenpanda,3,Tue Jul 21 20:17:07 2015 UTC,"There's a radio station in the Bay Area (California) that said that the band will stop by the bay in the fall. There's a 2 week space in the beginning of October, so that may be true. Might be related to what nachodroids said.  Sorry that this isn't related to the actual tour. I thought it that it might be useful for anyone in the Bay Area. It'd be nice if they had mini shows across NA during those breaks, but it may be some downtime/family."
Muse,3e17aq,nachodroids,2,Tue Jul 21 18:37:01 2015 UTC,"Here's the link to that contest thing/the post about it. Really far off from the fall though, the winner would have already been chosen by now too, they better be on this sub so we get some info!"
Muse,3e17aq,Neongreenpanda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks! But LA is in Southern California. San Francisco Bay Area is in Northern California, so I don't think they're related"
Muse,3e17aq,nachodroids,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, true, didn't even think of that. Here's hoping it's still some sort of small club show tour in the fall."

Muse,3dykt9,dso25,21,Mon Jul 20 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"my guess is that they are saving it for the 2016 indoors tour (where they will deploy real drones), same for the globalist. I don't think they will play it in 2015"

Muse,3dykt9,GuilleBriseno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"correct, but I don't think the ""show"" (with drones flying and everything) is prepared. I mean they've been focused on festivals lately, it just seems to me they haven't had the time to work on the preparation of that tour; I believe there will be a couple weeks without any shows so they can prepare this and start in 2016. but hey it was only a guess, I could be wrong!"
Muse,3dykt9,eric_castro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:07:21 2015 UTC,"and whatever happens, I just hope more oldies will continue to appear in their 2016 setlists. it's still hard to believe there has been Uno and The Handler in the same show. hoping for showbiz to make a comeback and muscle museum to make a REAL comeback not just that damn one time in exeter :p"
Muse,3dykt9,eric_castro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:12:18 2015 UTC,"Certainly, Citizen Erased will be back along with some Absolution gems. However, with the teasing about playing Drones in its entirety during the tour, setlists will be tight. They might play the classic mainstream songs but stuff like Showbiz or Muscle Museum will have to be a rarity rotated with OoS songs/B-Sides. I honestly feel we won't see much of Showbiz this tour. However, I'll keep my fingers crossed for Sunburn."
Muse,3dykt9,AtnertheFox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"I think I prefer Drones in its entirety over some oldies :O  But think about it, the setlist is huge. They have 11 songs (counting JFK, and Drill Sergeant) to play, I'm sure they can fit another 8 - 10 for the tour. Those could be in constant rotation (which gives them a bigger catalogue to rehearse). No city should be left without all of Drones IMO."
Muse,3dykt9,GuilleBriseno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:20 2015 UTC,"They have no gigs from the 25th july - 13th september, which is enough time to take a break and practice the indoor shows. And I do think they have been working on the indoor shows for a very long time now, they have mentioned some details in interviews. For example they will play in the center of the venue, they have drones and in the iHeart interview Matt was talking about some cool stuff but then he stopped talking because he didn't wanna give the entire show away. So I do think it's gonna be ready for the South American gigs and we'll get Defector sooner then 2016 :p"
Muse,3dykt9,JensDanneels,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:21:55 2015 UTC,"They've had the flying machines already made. Matt said so in an interview at BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend. Plus, it would upset many Muse fans if we got stripped down versions of the live show this year. He himself said the drones will be a thing for arenas because they can actually control contingencies in terms of the drones malfunctioning when in-doors."
Muse,3dykt9,AtnertheFox,5,Tue Jul 21 17:13:32 2015 UTC,"This upcoming guitar could have something to do with Defector, or possibly one of the other songs on the album which used the Whammy. It could even be subbed in for Reapers in the future instead of a lot of the Whammy stuff in the solo being MIDI programmed.  But they do have to save some songs for the actual Drones Tour. I actually kind of wish The Handler was saved until then, but on the bright side, at least it has got some play time and Matt has clearly become a bit more comfortable playing it both singing and nailing the solo."
Muse,3dykt9,sidious911,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:40 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the solo in Reapers is done by an octave pedal.
Muse,3dykt9,PotatoesAreUs,3,Mon Jul 20 20:09:44 2015 UTC,Isn't the DigiTech whammy pedal also an octave shifter?
Muse,3dykt9,sabaud,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:36:49 2015 UTC,"It's quite possible, but I've seen a live video where you can see that he's using a pedal. But who knows, he might change with the new guitar!"
Muse,3dykt9,PotatoesAreUs,3,Mon Jul 20 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"Nope classic whammy sound. Most of it is midi programmed, but he does do the very last bit manually live."

Muse,3dykt9,sabaud,9,Mon Jul 20 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"I think they're trying to figure out the best way to sing the 'SOCI-TEE' without forcing it to be a recording. It's an intense high harmony, easy to fuck up."
Muse,3dykt9,fat_over_lean,10,Mon Jul 20 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"Well, they either do it like Dead Inside or Mercy. I don't think it's a problem."
Muse,3dykt9,EffTheRulez,3,Mon Jul 20 17:40:01 2015 UTC,"It's not like recordings and stuff ruin the performance. Some stuff just can't be done entirely live and that's okay. As long as it's not overkill.   The only thing I wish Muse would do is manually do the echos in Handler, so the echo actually reflects the way it was sung the first time."
Muse,3dykt9,Forhavu,0,Tue Jul 21 03:50:22 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, yes. It wouldn't even be terribly hard. Hell, have Morgan handle the delay if Matt can't manage triggering it. I don't mean this as a Radiohead v Muse comment, but if they can do all the vocal samples and delays in Everything In Its Right Place live, I think Muse can work out a way to trigger a few sharp delay repeats."
Muse,3dykt9,ShadyEast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:45:27 2015 UTC,Do they use recordings in those songs?
Muse,3dykt9,disownedpear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:01 2015 UTC,"Er, no. Have you listened to them? :P  However Mercy used to have recorded vocals from the studio version, but I believe that was a one-off thing for... hmm just one TV show performance, can't remember which one it was."

Muse,3dykt9,mattiejj,2,Mon Jul 20 22:15:02 2015 UTC,Maybe the guitar part is a bit hard to play while singing and he needs more practice?
Muse,3dykt9,bobtom8482,9,Mon Jul 20 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"Nah, wouldn't say so, it's not hard as muse riffs go. If he can play the groove and sing, he can play defector. Plus, while recording, he's probably played it hundreds of times so it's ingrained in his brain."
Muse,3dykt9,GuilleBriseno,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:08 2015 UTC,"They must be rehearsing the vocals. The guys said that they can play the entire album (unlike the 2nd Law, or Resistance) from top to bottom."
Muse,3dykt9,Fabsolution,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:44:37 2015 UTC,"Once they play Defector, everyone will lose their minds. Then, during the encore of the same show, they will kick in with The Globalist. But wait, the whistling is replaced by a harmonica! And then... Oh man, another tease, it continues with Knights of Cydonia!"
Muse,3dykt9,Coza_1812,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:29:38 2015 UTC,"While I think it's true they're saving a few for the proper drones tour, the theory seems pretty solid. Defector does have that solo/outro that's constant whammy rocking back and forth, if it was built into the guitar he could move around the stage and not be tethered to his pedalboard.  However he could just have the whammy effects synced with midi like Unsustainable live. Perhaps whatever this new system allows for more spontaneity and improv. Maybe it will be controlled by an XY controller similar to what they did with the kaoss pad."
Muse,3dykt9,sidious911,10,Tue Jul 21 11:23:47 2015 UTC,Source? The Globalist doesn't even make use of Whammy effects.
Muse,3dykt9,Pwoper,4,Mon Jul 20 17:15:58 2015 UTC,"I think a doubleneck would suit the song. Top part for the slide guitar and solo, bottom part is a 7 string."

Muse,3dxe49,Sonicvolcano,6,Mon Jul 20 10:51:17 2015 UTC,"I love this version, I still keep coming back to it. The eurockeennes version of showbiz is pretty cool too, with that final solo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78a9oZR9FUw)"

Muse,3dxe49,Murphy-115,4,Mon Jul 20 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"It's no wonder Matt can't even figure out what the lyrics mean anymore, the song's been rewritten so many damn times! The studio version is basically bits and pieces of previous versions smashed together, so it makes sense that the song is confusing as a whole. If you look at the original lyrics, I think you can sort of see what Matt was thinking when he first wrote it (falling in love with/getting lost in technology), along with the meaning of the titular ""plug-in baby"".  ""I never meant to love these machines  But they obey my commands adeptly  I will never ever die  In their circuits I can survive   Can you hear me?  Cause I am leaving"""
Muse,3dxe49,MailTo,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"Was there not an even earlier version on the Newton Abbot demo or something? Pretty sure the verses followed the same melody as the current versions chorus, could've been a lot different if they'd released that one"

Muse,3duf6z,SiegmeyerofCatarina,3,Sun Jul 19 22:59:46 2015 UTC,Was that the one with Assassin on it?
Muse,3duf6z,xxTheexx,12,Sun Jul 19 19:54:38 2015 UTC,"No that's GH World Tour (the 4th). GH3 got Knights of Cydonia, and to be honest GH3 is the pinnacle of the series: best tracks and most enjoyable to play, even though there were no options to sing or play drums. By the way, GH5 has Plug In Baby and MB as a playable character (red Wembley suit)."
Muse,3duf6z,Fabsolution,4,Sun Jul 19 20:03:34 2015 UTC,I bought GH5 for that exact reason. I honestly hated GH5. It felt like it wasn't even developed properly. I stopped caring about GH after GHIII. Tabbing felt horrendous IMO
Muse,3duf6z,Javi333,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:30:56 2015 UTC,"Yes I understand :( I only own GH3 (later GH5 of which your reason was also one of mine), and I did not really hate GH5 but I've played it way less and compared to GH3 it is such a letdown. I also think that after GH3 the inclusion of options for drums and vocals also negatively affected the fun of playing guitar and bass tracks, as every instrument should be accounted for."
Muse,3duf6z,Fabsolution,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:07:54 2015 UTC,"The main problem was the speed and tabbing of the songs. I think for drums it had like expert+++ I think, so like it wasn't on sync or something"
