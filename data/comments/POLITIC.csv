Thanks to the FBI, CAIR and the mainstream media, every good and decent American knows that where the etiology of the Chattanooga shootings is concerned, he'd be better off declaring a Depression Free Zone or a Disreputable Friends Free Zone.  Those trying to connect the shootings to the sin-expiating blandishments of Muslim fundamentalism forget that Abdul Aziz could just as easily have shot up a Chipotle, or himself alone.  Heck, it's like positing that there's any overlap between ""Islam"" and ""Islamic extremism"" or something!  Finally, the issue became moot the second Abdul Aziz pulled the trigger anyway.   Our Theologian in Chief has ruled authoritatively that the religious self-identification which suffices for others, such as him, does not apply to Muslims, who become ersatz or former Muslims once they kill in Islam's name."

The far.. well, I guess it would be right in Pakistani terms, doesn't believe that they can trust India, so any ""deal"" would be one sided.  This is pretty much the same argument that the far right in America are touting about the Iran deal.  But as with any conflict that involves a region that two nations claim to be their own, and two people who are ideologically and emotionally opposites, it is difficult to separate logic from emotion.  Logically, politically, and economically, working with India helps Pakistan.  Having an agreement that allows them to tone down the ""defense"" measures in place against a possible invasion gives them more available money and man-power to fixing other issues within the country.  But that being said, in a region where feuds and hatred last for generations, it is extremely difficult to put on a happy face and negotiate with nation that you feel is trying to steal the land of your people.  Pakistan is an extremely interesting nation, one who perfectly fits the marxist philosophy of masks.  I'd be shocked if any two ambassadors to Pakistan saw the nation the same.  Pakistan has to keep up their ""strong military"" face, as well as their ""pious Islam"" face, all whilst trying to keep up international relations with a host of nations with vastly different ideals.    This doesn't even take into account the ISI who makes the CIA look like their hands are clean.  There are so many people in power in Pakistan with so many diverse goals, it is hard to really attribute one mind-set to their policy decisions.  tl;dr Pakistan never seems to be able to commit to anything with so many diverse voices screaming out different paths they should take except hate for India and fear of the impending war"
POLITIC,3e2o9t,politicsranting,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:51 2015 UTC,Yes it can be expected. But I don't understand why Pakistan holds India responsible for things that it has no proof of committing.

So, add that in with the intricacies of international negotiations in which most things make VERY little sense to someone who lives life on the micro level, there is significant area for displeasure seeing Pakistani leaders talking with the ""sworn enemy"" of India."

Re what had occurred at a remote aboriginal community, shortly after Queen Elizabeth visited the Flying Doctor Base at Alice Springs, March, 29, 1963.  Some time after her visit images that appeared to have been taken with modern circa 1963 photographic equipment, which resembled official police photographs, were passed from hand to hand at Port Augusta High School.  The one I saw showed an aboriginal girl of about 8 yrs whose body was severed completely in two, from about her breast bone one side to her kidney region the other.  The Northern Territory politician who raised the matter on a number of occasions in the face of hostile criticism, is thought to have met his demise at the height of the controversy, check Hansard.   Edit: At a game of football in Alice Springs in 1966, a middle aged aboriginal man approached the group I was with and told an identical story, that the Royal Party including the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had carried out a massacre at his home community.  His tale evoked memories of the photograph I had seen at school three yrs before, and of the news reports re the questions in Parliament .. he wandered thru the crowd telling everyone the same story.  A local bloke said he was on about the same thing all the time, and that he repeated the same material to everyone he came in contact with, the local consensus was that it was true, but in the absence of an official inquiry what the Hell are you gonna do about it.    As well News.Yahoo should follow up on the matter of 17 yo Latvian Alisa Dmitrijeva, who went missing from her home in August 2011.

I honestly can't tell if the narrative is the view of the author or what he perceives to be the views of white men who vote republican.     Women vote Democrat because they understandably want the convenience of being able to kill their unwanted children. They vote Democrat because they want free birth control and they want free healthcare for the kids they decide to keep. Women also vote for Democrats because Democrats offer special programs to help women get education and jobs.  Women have always depended on men for protection, but they’d rather depend on many men than just one or a few, so they are happy to vote for measures to increase “security.” As a group, women don’t like or understand guns, so they vote Democrat because Democrats promise to take guns away from men–usually those working-class white men–and give them to the big group of men in the government.    Blacks vote Democrat because they are smart and racist. They were going to vote for Obama no matter what he did because he was black, and like sensible people they figure it is better to have one of your own in power. Democrats, as a group, are known for caring more about giving free stuff to black people. Blacks are smart, because they know that it is always better to get something for free than to pay for it.  Gay people vote Democrat because Democrats offer gay people stuff they think they want. Aside from marriage and sadistic thrill of being able to force Christians to make wedding cakes, this includes free healthcare. Free healthcare comes in handy when you’re a man who occasionally has sex with guys he met 30 minutes ago on Grindr, or a lesbian who occasionally gets drunk and has sex with men. (See the first point about women above.)"

I'm sorry for being snooty.   BUT - you are making the mistake of assuming that government is anything like private work. Government work can bureaucratic, slow and extremely political. Due in large part to strong employee protections.   While that makes it hard to get anything done – imagine the pendulum swinging in the other direction. People let go for very little reason, no protection on how many hours you’re required to put in (salaried positions in particular), bosses ONLY caring about production and none about the ass in the seat.   There’s a definite middle ground between work being good for employees and good for managers/owners/etc. And having worked on both sides of the fence – I lean towards protection over efficiency.  For the record, I don't have anything against government work. I'd like to get a job w/ the VA myself. One of the few jobs you can do that does, tangibly, do good for people who need it."

I know people who have to work 100+ a week, because they have crazy hard jobs to do (surgeons, lawyers), but those jobs are usually extremely high payed.    I guess my personal experience is salaried workers in mid level desk jobs, which is basically the reddit populace, sit around and scan the internet in between short bursts of work and ready to clock out at 5 unless something crazy happens.  After doing land surveying, then the military, and then contracting in Afghanistan, it's a harsh reality that people don't put in work the entire time they are at work.  European nations are showing that you can be just as productive on a 36 hour work week as a 40.  But in America, with the focus on minimizing cost (usually cutting workers or useful technology) while still trying to maintain output.  That is just insanity.  If you do things right, it can often be done faster than you'd expect.   I'd like to get a gov't job myself, mainly for the job security.

The author's not saying all whites are racist, he's saying the system is inherently racist, and that whites often are complicit in helping to perpetuate the racism without even realizing it.  But to me this is the most important point he's making:   The reality of America is that White people are fundamentally good, and so when a white person commits a crime, it is a sign that they, as an individual, are bad. Their actions as a person are not indicative of any broader social construct. Even the fact that America has a growing number of violent hate groups, populated mostly by white men, and that nearly all serial killers are white men can not shadow the fundamental truth of white male goodness. In fact, we like White serial killers so much, we make mini-series about them.  White people are good as a whole, and only act badly as individuals.  People of color, especially Black people (but boy we can talk about “The Mexicans” in this community) are seen as fundamentally bad. There might be a good one– and we are always quick to point them out to our friends, show them off as our Academy Award for “Best Non-Racist in a White Role”– but when we see a bad one, it’s just proof that the rest are, as a rule, bad.   When a white man commits a crime, only he / she gets the blame.  When a minority commits a crime, his / her behavior is attributed to their entire race.  Sometimes openly, sometimes subconsciously, but either way it's nearly always the reaction in today's racist society.  And it needs to stop."

Its a shame heads can be more meta, and/or think critically or reflexively instead of exploding; Its also a bit ironic in that the same kind of ignorance that would attribute violence or the predisposition to crime to particular race are the same types of people who would deny the science of genetics when it comes to a question of something like evolution.

The system was made for White people  The entire discussion of race in America centers around the protection of White feelings.  Ask any Black person and they’ll tell you the same thing.  We see this in the way that one Muslim killer is a sign of Islamic terror; in the way one Mexican thief is a pointer to the importance of border security; in one innocent, unarmed Black man is shot in the back by a cop, then sullied in the media as a thug and criminal.   Why are we comparing an Islamic killer and Mexican thief with and ""innocent, unarmed black man""?

He's saying that as white people, we - (I'm white as well) - are complicit a system that has evolved and established itself through reinforcing stereotypical perceptions of others who are not white.  This reinforcement happens in subtle ways that most white people don't even recognize.  But this privileging of white experience over black experience has created a culture where white people are afforded the right to be able to think of themselves as individuals - society grants them this on the bases of being part of the hegemonic group.  The ""I"" in the title I, Racist is the coginito ""I"" of self actualization.   Non-whites, on the contrary have no such luxury and are viewed as a collective ""other.""   There is no similar level of self actualization possible in the black community because the dominant social group has attached their own signifiers to what it means to be black.   Because she clearly dosen't harbour any animosity towards blacks, his aunt takes offence to being judged as racist, she herself, is not being judged as an individual which bothers her.  Yet she can't recognize where her skin colour has given her a social advantage, she's oblivious to all these subtle injustices within a system she willingly (or unconsciously - doesn't matter)  participates in.

The Mediterranean European states and Southern Europe generally are the first ones to go because they've historically had socialism without the work ethic and industry to support it.  That's why Spain and Portugal are also in a lot of pain.  Next up is Italy.  Sooner or later, pretty much all of Western Europe, even the Northern states are going to either have to scale back this socialist stupidity or manage to go broke.  There is no more American taxpayer picking up the tab for European defense and global competition means that you cannot make 30 euro an hour putting in bolts on the bottom of new cars.  The oil-rich nations may be spared this but all of Europe will feel this contagion sooner or later.  Combine that with the death spiral of indigenous population loss all of Europe is undergoing and the continent is doomed, in well less than a hundred years.  If ISIS wants Europe they don't have to bomb anything.  Just move there and have kids and they'll own it in the next century.

There are currently  13 4 star officers in just the Army (39 across all branches), some of whom operate more in the political sphere than in the military. Add in all of their staff members and you have a group of individuals (who are often targeted by lobbying groups which basically amounts to being bribed as most citizens view it)  contributing less to the actual function of the military than the enlisted and lower level officers they technically lead. Granted the most effective way of doing this would be to go to a different criteria for election to political office that would resemble the path discussed in several fictional novels within the last 50 years or so.

Interpret that notion as you will.  From my experience and based off what I've seen, it isn't until higher learning and education that one learns about these political aspects and even then, exposure to these topics are limited unless a person chooses a class or majors in these areas of academia.  Consider how many (or few) Americans go to college these days, and among those who chooses to major in fields like politics or social sciences and you may have something of an answer to your question."

But I'm sure that Stein, with her airy platitudes and feelgood philosophy has a lot to teach someone who's actually been doing what she says needs to be done for almost as long as I've been alive. She's right about a lot of things but one - Sanders is not running to lead the Dems in the direction they've been headed since Clinton, Sanders is running to change the direction of the Democratic party (and the country) entirely."

POLITIC,3c8qca,vieditor,-10,Mon Jul 6 13:46:42 2015 UTC,You cannot have a right to a service provided by someone else. That is literally slavery.
POLITIC,3c8qca,salacio,7,Mon Jul 6 05:41:54 2015 UTC,"If you read the article, it says there isn't a tight correlation between countries that declare healthcare a right vs. those that don't and health services (insurance and/or care).    You can opine that health care isn't a right, but you've lost it when you claim it's slavery.  Do you know what slavery is?    The ACA is not requiring you to provide me a service.  It is requiring everyone to buy a service (insurance), but that doesn't mean anyone has to provide it.  However, if you are a doctor, you should love having more customers.  If you are an insurance provider, you love the ACA too.  But you can shut down your practice and go sell shoes if you want.  No one is enslaving you.   Someone else will happily sell me insurance instead of you.    The ACA is about helping break down barriers preventing consumers from access to services, not telling you that you have to provide your services as a slave.  Big difference.  Literally."

POLITIC,3c8qca,fezzuk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:07:09 2015 UTC,"Oddly that outlook seems to make healthcare more expensive.  With a profit motive and the inability for people to shop around for healthcare, healthcare providers charge more.  With a cost involved, individuals are less likely to be seen for minor issues which causes problems to become worse and require a more expensive solution.  You can talk about ideals and having the right to the fruits of your own labor, but you're still going to foot the bill anyway for the people that can't pay for themselves and got the more expensive treatment because they couldn't afford the cheaper preventative care.  And then you're going to foot the bill again when that person's poverty drags down the value of your community."
POLITIC,3c8qca,Mylon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:14:39 2015 UTC,"Profit motive in every other free market business decreases costs because of so many different groups all competing for the same profit, and inability for people to shop around for healthcare is the government's fault.   It's the government that made it illegal to buy insurance across state lines.   It's the government that started employer paid healthcare plans through wage controls.   It's the government that stipulated an insurance plan has to have such and such features regardless of whether or not the client needs them.   It's the government that regulates that nurses can't perform the same duties as a doctor regardless of if they know the procedure or not.  It's the government that regulates drugs through the FDA causing their research price to skyrocket, potentially killing people that could be saved by experimental drugs.  I don't have a problem with charity focused medical services, my point is when they are forced through laws and regulations. There was plenty of charity in this nation before the government started interfering through Social Security and Medicare style programs. Speaking of government programs, how about the poverty level dropping in middle 20th century and then after Johnson's Great Society coming to a dead halt and fluctuating between 15% and 8% since then.  http://www.economicsjunkie.com/us-poverty-rate-how-the-great-society-programs-reversed-its-decline/"
POLITIC,3c8qca,salacio,2,Mon Jul 6 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"When you're having a heart attack, you can't shop around.  Healthcare costs are also difficult to predict even if you do have time to plan a procedure the hospital can't give you an estimate for your care so you can shop around and compare estimates.  Because of this, it's easy to tack on some $80 aspirin to an existing stay.  Yes, there's a lot of asinine regulations that needs to be fixed.  But it seems the only way to get anything passed through our government is through giant bills instead of lots of small ones that fixes individual issues."

Because of this, it's easy to tack on some $80 aspirin to an existing stay.   Again this is better solved by decreasing the regulations surrounding health care insurance. The government says you can't deny someone service for a preexisting condition (even though that would be crazy in any other industry) so people wait to get insurance until they very need it, or because insurance plans are so focused on group plans that it makes it difficult for the average person to get a single or family coverage plan that they aren't able to take their health insurance with them between jobs even though no other type of insurance is tied to your job."
