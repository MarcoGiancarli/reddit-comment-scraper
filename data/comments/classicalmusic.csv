classicalmusic,3e35ow,Pit-trout,2,Tue Jul 21 21:06:26 2015 UTC,"It's not better, it's just how the style was for many composers of the time. Light, quick movements on the keys, on rather restrained pianos. While that method may be better for that specific style (and Viennese action pianofortes) , that doesn't mean it's better for a sweeping legato crescendo run up the keyboard. On top of that, the pianos (and their strings) could not physically handle the abuse our modern pianos can.  It's crazy to hear something like Beethoven's pathetique sonata played on a Viennese action keyboard from 1800, compared to how we hear it today played on a gigantic Steinway with modern action, and modern expressive technique."

classicalmusic,3e35ow,Creedelback,2,Tue Jul 21 23:42:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing this technique as being radically different than what my professor suggested in college, especially the focus on singular finger movements (mainly to decrease tension, but also for a good legato). The fingers should crawl across the keyboard like a spider, she would say.  Keeping the elbows so close to the body though is something she was not so strict about.  But I wonder how much technique changed due to changes in the action of pianos. I've never played a fortepiano, so I don't know how different they feel.  I also wonder if it's because of the advent of video that, for many, technique has become so varied. For example, people see the strange technique of Gould or Horowitz and try to emulate that."

classicalmusic,3e2qun,malilla,13,Tue Jul 21 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"I seriously don't think the price is what is putting people off classical music, if it is it's more a myth perpetuated by media outlets that puts people off, and then they publish these stories! Then orchestras doing things like this have a problem - on one hand they are destroying the stereotype, on the other hand, they are perpetuating a non existent ""problem"" to fight back against.  I've been to gigs/concerts of pretty much all types, and Classical/Jazz seems very much like the cheapest to me! For instance this weekend I could (unfortunately I am working) go and see a great orchestra play Mahler 8 for a ticket price of between £20-35 just an hour on the train away. Mahler 8 must be one of the most expensive and tough concerts to put on, I would say a maximum price of £35 is very reasonable indeed. If I wanted to go and see a pop/rock equivalent (and I have before), I would probably be expected to shell out £70-80 for a standing ticket, perhaps £120+ if I wanted to sit. I would also have to travel far further, probably stay the night, against costing me more money.   I do think there a few things that orchestras could do to make their concerts more accessible, and definitely audience interaction is one of them. I'm not talking about Andre Rieu style schmaltz and corny jokes, but perhaps just acknowledging them and talking for maybe a minute or so about the piece coming up rather than walking on, sitting down, playing and then walking off. Plenty of performers do that, and some of the most popular through history (e.g Bernstein) have done that in the past."
classicalmusic,3e2qun,Shyguy10101,3,Tue Jul 21 15:41:14 2015 UTC,"I am not familiar with the UK classical market and know nothing about the Halle Orchestra, but I think price is a very important factor for any classical market and it does have a direct effect on consumers.   I used to live in Brussels where I could regularly see interesting repertoire performed quite well for not too much money- I don't think I ever spent more than €20 on a ticket. I would sometimes go to concerts multiple times per week and I wouldn't mind spending the money, since I felt each individual concert was valued appropriately.  Now I live in Washington, DC, where classical music is a scarcity, and where well-played classical music is even scarcer. Our National Symphony Orchestra is average at best, they perform ordinary repertoire, and the cheapest I've ever seen tickets is $39 (around €35). I'm sure many people, like me, paid their $39 or more once or twice, had a forgettable experience, and decided that they've been priced out- they don't value the concert at $39 so why should they pay that much? What would they value it at instead? From that perspective I think the Halle experiment sounds really worthwhile.  So I don't know much about pricing in the UK, but price completely puts me off classical music where I live now, and I would not be surprised if I'm not the only one.  Are rock/pop concerts actually an economic substitute for classical concerts? I've never been convinced that they are."
classicalmusic,3e2qun,RenwikCustomer,3,Tue Jul 21 18:38:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, I wouldn't disagree that price is a factor in anybody going to anything, the narrative I was arguing against is one you continually see in the UK media, that classical music in particular is more expensive than other forms of music and that this puts people off classical in general. I would argue the myth probably puts more people off than the reality, because when you take a look at the reality, you see that classical is actually one of the cheapest types of live music you can go and see, quite remarkable when you consider the training and instruments required (although I suspect it has something to do with popular music not being subsidised)."

classicalmusic,3e4mhg,Rocket_Sciencetist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:35:23 2015 UTC,"You shoudl try Le Gibet from Ravel's Gaspard de la Nuit or his Pavane for a Dead Princess. The latter is quite famous and I really like it (especially the original piano version). If you like Le Gibet check out Charles Griffes' 3 tone pictures, specifically the lake at evening. I'm a huge fan of him and wish he'd get far more attention!  Leo Ornstein's impromptus are very dark and mournful, as are quite a few of his works. Feel free to look into Eller's ""the bells"" or his prelude in bflat minor. Liebermann's 2nd movement of Gargoyles is very eerie too.   The Elegy from John Ireland's Downland Suite is another favourite of mine. Loved playing it in a brass band. If you like that try the 2nd movement of Herbert Howell's Pageantry which is also quite sad. Vladigerov's Autumn Elegy is also really nice as is Mosonyi's Funeral Procession by Liszt which is also quite powerful.  Bortkiewicz has an Elegie op 46 which is lush and really pulls on your heart strings like most of his music. I always end up recommending this composer no matter what the request is because he has so much to offer and gets no attention.   If you like Bortkieiwcz, try Now Lettest Thou Depart from Rachmaninov's vespers. He wanted it sung at his funeral and its some of the best choral music out there in my opinion (though, I'm not huge on choral music). He also has a piece called Tears (op 5 no 3) which is quite sad; His symphonic poem ""Isle of the Dead"" is about someone's journey to the afterlife. His preludes are a good source too, for example his prelude in f major (an obscure piece of his) or his prelude in B minor op 32 no 10. Most of his later works tend to be very dark and brooding, so just have a browse.  Debussy has a piece called ""Le Vêtement du Blessé"" (The Dressing of the Wounded) written in WW1.  The last movement in Scriabin's first sonata is a funeral march. In fact try his sonata nos 6 and 9 which are far more dark. I'd wager you'd struggle to find a darker sonata from any other composer.  Mahler's 9th symphony is said to be the closest to death you'll get in music. Some say it's him coming to terms with the fact he does not have long to live. Bernstein describes it as ""the most musically realistic description of death itself"".  Alkan has a very sombre piece titled 'La chanson de la folle au bord de la mer' ('The song of the mad woman by the seashore') which I really like, too. Lyapunov's last transcendental etude is quite dark as well; you can look at Sibelius' op 103 no 5: in a mournful mood too. In terms of symphonies try Pettersson's 7th or Gorecki's 3rd.  Okay, there's a big list and I bet theres quite a few in there that not many people will have heard of. Hope you find something you like in there!  There is one composer who is renowned for heartbreaking music whose life was incredibly hard. I'm sure he had some kind of crippling disease which he channelled into his music. I can not remember his name at the moment, though. I can tell this going to bother me so much now."

The more I learn historically, the more I understand the subtleties and nuances of a composer's work and world view.  There is a lot of great literature on the subject of music history alone.

How about we extend this attitude to literature just to see how hypocritical it is:  War and Peace is such a great book. It has so much depth to it and it's incredible to see how Tolstoy develops the varied characters and plotlines, all the while considering the nature of history and what drives it forward and pondering the great existential questions which have fascinated humanity for centuries. It's such a rich book and it would be a travesty to read it just as a two-dimensional story about a few folk wandering around Russia while Napoleon invades.  But hold on, Twilight is also a book and it features a love story like War and Peace. Don't you dare point out that it lacks the depth and propensity to be analysed in the same way as War and Peace; you're just one of those snobby people who like Russian literature and uses it to feel superior.  If you treat them both simply as stories and completely disregard the depth which is present in one and absent in the other, then they're basically equal!  It is a hideous double-standard. Why are you allowed to suggest that one form of literature is better than another and should be read more closely because there is far more detail and nuance present therein, yet the instant someone has the audacity to suggest that classical music should be experienced in a different way to other forms of music, they're a snobby elitist?

Altering your personal chemistry to listen to music is one way to experience it from a different angle of your psyche.  Analytical elements of a piece like the patterns and variations of phrasing and the structure might be experienced visually on LSD. Blurring the lines between a critical and a visceral listening is something your good self might enjoy.  I feel like you might be judging drug use negatively because of unpleasant direct experiences you may have had with  inexperienced or thoughtless users of substances. You certainly have a strong emotional reaction to the whole issue of listening high.   My personal preference, having said all that, is to listen straight more than not.

Alcohol or drugs were almost always something that they did besides composing or to the detriment of their composing.  However, when I was 14, 15 and still smoked pot, I credit being stoned to a lot of my discovery of - to speak in a cliche - the wonders of art.

Then I can have a few drinks or smoke weed and sit back and take it all in, less an analytical state of mind and more emotional. Do I need a substance to feel the  emotion? Absolutely not! It does change my thought process, perspective and experience of the piece though. So yes, it does reveal layers to something I might not have found before, or may have taken much longer to get to.  Edit: I would like to add that from the small handful of times I did acid, music was not just a sideshow for my trip, but became the entire universe in a sense. Nothing else mattered but the music playing and getting lost in it.

My grandma loved Beethoven. Didn't know a thing about music other than what she liked and didn't like. She also held Benny Goodman and Pete Seeger on the same level. Did everyone agree? Nope. My grandpa hated Pete Seeger's ""caterwauling"" and my uncle, who was a cellist and held a degree in performance didn't listen to anything but classical music. That sure as hell didn't change her opinion.  Sometimes I listen to classical while driving. Am I giving it the attention it deserves when I do that? Probably not in your eyes, but I'll sure keep doing it.  As a musician I view music differently than those who don't play an instrument. I couldn't stand hearing my sister blast Green Day when we were kids and I teased her for listening to them. Looking back, that was wrong. She got something out of it I didn't, and likewise her and my music.

If you do need to start brushing up on stuff, I would recommend tackling some of the big trends in 20th century music. At least for me, our coursework barely touched on 20th cent, but my comp professors always expected me to know a lot about them.   Although really, as an undergrad you're there to learn. You don't need to be a professional-level expert."

I was upset that the person I was interested in wasn't interested in me, but as I sat and listened I realized I needed to stop feeling sorry for myself. My loneliness was nothing compared to the cruelty of Ludwig's hearing loss (at the time of the composition of the ninth), and yet he'd managed to compose not just powerful, beautiful music, but powerful, beautiful music ABOUT JOY! As I thought about that, listened to the 120 member choir, and read the translation of the text (which you should read! It made me feel both happier and sadder at the same time.) I lost it. Niagara falls. I managed to get to my car before the heaving started, but it was close. Most powerful musical experience of my life, by a wide margin.   tl;dr: I feel you man. #9 is powerful shit."

I am amazed you would take such a leap. I mean, college is a lot of money in america right??   I am not scolding you or anything, I'm just fascinated. Somebody earlier made a post about musicians not having plans very much, maybe I have always planned too much..  Or you might be interested in studying less academic composition perhaps (video games, movies.. less tight formally and intellectually but more freedom to not have to avoid cliche/pastiche)? I guess I just thought everyone who was serious enough to spending big money on learning composition would have at least heard Beethoven.

Then go for Mozart, he has considerably less: 41.  When you listen to Mozart after Haydn you can see how much he pushes the form.  Then... hmm... Beethoven I guess (Just 9 from old Ludwig).  A lot of people disagree on what order to place Beethoven's symphonies on the scale of ""the best"" - I'll give my top five in no particular order: 3rd, 5th, 9th, 7th, 6th, 8th.  After Beethoven it's got to be Mahler - Beethoven had basically brought the symphonic form to its natural conclusion but Mahler's orchestration is truly wonderful.  (This is all just my opinion)."

It is a flawed masterpiece. I know everyone here (as exemplified by this post) likes to get on board with the narrative that this is the greatest symphony ever and a mind-altering and cosmic journey, but sometimes it's necessary to take a step back and actually view it without this narrative clouding your ability to consider it.  In my opinion, it is the least successful incarnation of Beethoven's variation-fugue finale type - this 'nursery rhyme', straight from its nativity can hardly sustain the almost violent transformations it is put through. The introduction to it is similarly unsubtle, and the whole thing is really a reiteration of the hammerklavier's finale - the earlier movements are recalled and cut off by the first notes of the nursery rhyme melody.   I'm not going to argue that the rest of the symphony is bad; far from it (although I still have a slight issue with the exposition of the opening movement which always niggles me as sort of out of place) but it's quite telling that somebody expressing a negative opinion of the 9th gets downvoted. This adoration of the 9th has grown into a dogma and people would do well to realise that."

I do appreciate the things Beethoven does with it though, but when it is finally stated in all its pomposity I don't want to listen to it anymore. The 9th is important for various (compositional) reasons of course, but I do feel the importance of the major melody is overstated (not too mention that it is now the European National Anthem, yuck!)."

classicalmusic,3dzoah,Marvinkmooneyoz,4,Tue Jul 21 05:31:34 2015 UTC,"If you listen to his sketches and listen to the symphony intently you find it a bit more interesting. The whole last movement being a double fugue for instance. And referencing the past movements in rhythm and such. I hate it when people act like his ninth's 4th movement is just the ""Ode to Joy"" melody.   Also, it's beautiful and simplistic, he was setting a poem to music and needed something that felt that music was working and transcending the words.

I really can't listen to Beethoven anymore for that reason - the guy was too serious about his music, serious to the level of being ridiculous for our reality. We are simply culturally advance beings, we no longer get caught in this theatrical installations - our feelings feel bad in those artificial environments, we feel raped. We see there is something deeply artificial in this type of culture, due to a massive experience we get before we even mature. Think about it- how much culture a person 100 years ago could consume? We are overfed with it (but that is what makes us refine our taste). So Beethoven is like a fucking ridiculous giant cake made of pure sugar - we understand the pleasure of it, but it simply is too much for the modern stomach. We seek a more complicated taste than this. And Beethoven is simply not enough enigmatic. The finale just jizzes you all over the face with the bombastic exhiliarating (quite militaristic in tempo - quite violent) feeling, which is almost pornographic.   It is as if Beethoven has moved down on the ladder of art, he is too primitive for most of us today, already too rugged.  All of us know the feeling of joy is not that simple, not that one-sided. The Romanticism tought us the ambiguities of feelings, Schubert, Chopin, and of course Wgner. And the modernism finally revealed the mechanistic, deterministic aspect of it.  Honestly, I get better idea of joy from Bachs light inventions (like a sort of frivolous, but attentive, [not this seasure of Mozart], a harmonious, non-pretentious happyness of playing simple pleasant music) , than from this cannonade of Beethoven, who is trying to shout out something that can only be whispered. So you are really allowed to feel this ridiculous contradiction.  I could go on and on. I think I made my point."
classicalmusic,3dzoah,guitarelf,17,Tue Jul 21 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"the guy was too serious about his music   Coming from the guy with the Wagner flair.   E: To expand I agree with you Beethoven did take music very seriously, just as he took everything seriously. You say it like it's a bad thing. However to top it all off you are a Wagner fan which is probably the only composer I would put above Beethoven in terms of 'seriousness'."
classicalmusic,3dzoah,-muse,11,Mon Jul 20 23:02:41 2015 UTC,I'd LOVE to know why you have Wagner flair then
classicalmusic,3dzoah,Keith-Ledger,-7,Tue Jul 21 01:02:07 2015 UTC,If you listen to Wagner and you are not deaf - you will get it sooner or later.
classicalmusic,3e4vdq,whyhavename,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:45:26 2015 UTC,What do you listen to outside of classical music? I can give you an idea of stuff that will be close to that and you can go from there.
classicalmusic,3e4vdq,Camotes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:52:42 2015 UTC,I actual don't generally listen to music. However I do want to start. and I know that I like classical better than most if not all other types of music as I am in my schools band and I loved some of the songs that we play.
classicalmusic,3e4uph,AdmOxalate,2,Tue Jul 21 23:40:01 2015 UTC,"Bach's is a bit too obvious I guess, but it shouldn't be unsaid just in case someone here hasn't heard it yet.  Berg knew his way around the passacaglia, I can't find a youtube link to it but the one in Scene 4 of Wozzeck is not to be missed. There is also one in the Altenberg Lieder as mentioned in the description to the passacaglia fragment."

classicalmusic,3dztp3,fdsa4321lbp22,7,Mon Jul 20 21:30:42 2015 UTC,"I see you're really into concert band repertoire. I'd thoroughly recommend having a look at Herbert Howells (pageantry), George Lloyd (diversions on a bass theme), Edward Gregson (prelude for an occaision, connotations), Philip Sparke (pantomime, london overture, Music of the Spheres), Peter Graham (on the shoulders of giants, torchbearer), Peter Meechan (the legend of king arthur), and John Ireland (his downland suite). I know some of these are for brass band but they're certainly very similar and many composers work with both ensembles. Also try Macmillan's Jebel if you can find it!  I just think it would be nice to branch out from Holst's suites and Graigner. I'm sure you'll find something you like."
classicalmusic,3dztp3,jaiowners,4,Mon Jul 20 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"It's nice to see some brass band repertoire mentioned on this sub! Some other good examples for OP are Paganini Variations by Philip Wilby, Blitz by Derek Bourgeois, Harmony Music by Philip Sparke and Trittico by James Curnow. Edit: Incidentally, I played Diversions on a Bass Theme recently. The E-flat tuba part is a bitch, but it's a great piece."
classicalmusic,3dztp3,broadgauge53,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:39 2015 UTC,"I really love the pieces which are by composers who also composed symphonies and such (George Lloyd, Herbert Howells, Malcolm Arnold and John Ireland). Though I have to admit the whole contemporary style of Sparke and Graham deserve more attention. It's a whole new evolutionary path for Classical music which seldom gets the attention it should."
classicalmusic,3dztp3,jaiowners,3,Tue Jul 21 00:16:55 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. Brass banding is often looked down upon by some classical music ""snobs"" due to its working class heritage, but the modern brass band movement is a hotbed of avant-garde composition and virtuosic performance. It really doesn't get the respect, or attention, it so richly deserves. Edit: You've probably heard it already, but Sparke's The Year of the Dragon is another great piece. There's a version of it for symphonic band that OP may enjoy, but I still prefer the brass band version."
classicalmusic,3dztp3,broadgauge53,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:36 2015 UTC,"Add anything...and I mean anything..by Paul Lovatt-Cooper. Immortal is especially incredible. After a slow introduction, it's balls-to-the-wall for a while, then a gorgeous trumpet melody, then more wall-balls. Amazing piece."
classicalmusic,3dztp3,Ken_Breadbox,-9,Tue Jul 21 15:11:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, what a shock. Still posting the latest band pieces you found in your high school's library.  Please branch out."

classicalmusic,3dyyz5,SuperBreakfast,27,Mon Jul 20 17:54:09 2015 UTC,"Here is the cook in question.  "" ""he [Gluck] knows no more of contrappunto, as mein cook, Waltz"". This statement is very likely true, but misunderstood. Gustavus Waltz was an excellent singer who performed in many of Handel's works and he was an excellent contrapuntist.""  So, this cook was pretty good at music"
classicalmusic,3dyyz5,LudwigDeLarge,13,Mon Jul 20 18:12:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this information!  It could very well be something of a joke - I may assume. Especially if alcohol was involved in the mix! It is important to note that in the year 1745, Gluck went to England where Händel's music was highly regarded. So another point could be that the German influence was not apt to be exalted at this time (even though  Gluck wrote no operas in German)  I could see Georg exclaiming this after they were all out to supper, having a great time, intending no maliciousness by any means. Their ""competition"" was most likely a myth propelled by the public, not necessarily a true rivalry, as we have seen in music history a few times.  Either way, you are correct, Mister Waltz (what an epic last name for a musician) was a credible musician"
classicalmusic,3dyyz5,ibellifinzi,6,Mon Jul 20 18:19:38 2015 UTC,Handel loved talking smack about anyone and everyone. I think he may have been on of the best in the business.
classicalmusic,3dyyz5,nmitchell076,4,Mon Jul 20 18:34:58 2015 UTC,"Which is funny, because Handel is way more German than Gluck is, stylistically speaking."
classicalmusic,3dyyz5,azdac7,5,Mon Jul 20 20:30:50 2015 UTC,Handel was a notorious shitstirrer.
classicalmusic,3dyyz5,nmitchell076,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:49 2015 UTC,"How much of what Gluck said to Kelly is Gluck saying something true, and how much of it is just exchanging pleasantries? A kind of ""you're English? Handel was in England! Handel's great, as is England, and you by extension!"" It isn't too hard to imagine that he had a similar line cooked up for wherever his guests at the time were from. (Oh, your from Naples? Isn't Pergolesi great! If there's anyone I have spent my life trying to Imitate, it's him!)  It's also worth noting that Handel is responding to a competitor at the time he quipped that remark.   I don't really think there's much of a connection between Gluck and Handel stylistically, TBH."
classicalmusic,3e1csk,SuperBreakfast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:07:56 2015 UTC,"Now, that is cheerful, friendly Bartok.  Likely to appeal to those who don't normally don't go for Bartok (not that I consort with those, mind you).  But I like it, too.  I remember when I was in high school, I read a book on music history that said Bartok was the guy who introduced ""wrong notes"" into music -- on purpose.  Even that author would be okay with this, though."
