losangeleskings,3e48yd,RubeusShagrid,3,Tue Jul 21 20:58:28 2015 UTC,"Someday, I hope for Disney to start a new team in Newport Beach. They can call them the Newport Beach Merman and have King Triton as the logo. With their colors being sea green, sea blue, and beach sand. They can play in the Under the Sea Stadium, with  Sebastian the Crab as a mascot.  Lastly, somewhere in the stadium, around the crowd, there needs to be a podium with Walt's head on top."

A bit of a rant, but with the expansion bids going in, it's all anyone here is talking about. The radio stations this morning were all up in arms and offended like ""just give us a shot to prove we could make it work!""  Yeah, cause the NHL is in the business of just ""taking a shot"" at a franchise."

losangeleskings,3e1j09,CrispyLardon,6,Tue Jul 21 06:15:50 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority here... But I don't see him as being very detrimental to the team.   I like the guy, but on the ice he's big and slow. Good positional D-man, which I guess we need, he just doesn't make my nipples hard is all."
losangeleskings,3e1j09,RubeusShagrid,8,Tue Jul 21 15:52:42 2015 UTC,"I think this season with Big Rig retired it will be easier to stomach Greener's speed, since we won't have two big and slow old dudes."
losangeleskings,3e1j09,mecha_pope,3,Tue Jul 21 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. As long as he plays within his role and has limited minutes, he's good. The locker room presence will be important too, with some young and new faces."
losangeleskings,3e1j09,anexanhume,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:17 2015 UTC,Agreed. His leadership is valuable.
losangeleskings,3e1j09,paranoidpikachu,6,Tue Jul 21 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, Greener--you silly goose."
losangeleskings,3e1j09,Omnivirus,5,Tue Jul 21 06:16:07 2015 UTC,The goal came off an excellent McNabb pass. It shall be his legacy.
losangeleskings,3e1j09,crass_bonanza,6,Tue Jul 21 13:50:04 2015 UTC,I love that Sutter still asked him why he was out of position after that goal. Haha.
losangeleskings,3e1j09,Heighdone,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:10 2015 UTC,Quite possibly my favorite Kings reaction gif in existence.
losangeleskings,3e1j09,Heighdone,5,Tue Jul 21 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"I'm all for Greene as a 5th or 6th guy. But when he needs to be moved up because of injuries, his limitations are quite easily exposed and exploited.   Yeah he's mean and rough and he knows the system. He's just too slow.  That being said, he must be one of the more respected guys in the room if he has an A despite all of this, so he brings more to the table than just his game."
losangeleskings,3e1j09,Heighdone,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:43 2015 UTC,I am intrigued to see if Greene has finally figured out the blue line interference rules.

losangeleskings,3e0k1k,nenright,19,Tue Jul 21 00:56:24 2015 UTC,"I hope he's a King for life. I hope he retires and the Kings build a statue for him at center ice. I hope they make him president of the team. I hope Phil Anschutz just gives the whole franchise to him. If Anze plays until he's 90 and he's terrible for the last 55 years of his career, but all of those seasons come as a member of the Kings, then I'd be happy until I die. I hope the Kings retire his number and also all multiples of 11. Retire #99 again and put Kopitar's name on the jersey. I don't care. Rename the team from Kings to Kopitars. Make him ruler of the entire damn planet. Anze, if you read this, please adopt me. I love you very much.   Beauty.  Also, hopefully somewhere in the ballpark of 9m/season. Although that's very wishful thinking, I imagine."
losangeleskings,3e0k1k,RubeusShagrid,4,Tue Jul 21 01:27:13 2015 UTC,It doesn't help the fact that kopitar has the same agent as Towes and Kane..
losangeleskings,3e0k1k,LAKingBob,3,Tue Jul 21 01:52:14 2015 UTC,"True, but even he gets their cap hit, that'll be okay. Cap has gone up since then, so to match the value of their contracts, he'd need more.   So 10-10.5 would be... acceptable.   Agh. God I kinda hate that one player can get well over 10% of the salary for a given year."
losangeleskings,3e0k1k,RubeusShagrid,4,Tue Jul 21 02:07:50 2015 UTC,I would be really happy if it was 9.5 per year.
losangeleskings,3e0k1k,dalbtraps,12,Tue Jul 21 01:52:23 2015 UTC,"I think he deserves at or just over 9 mil. Just because the Blackhawks took on stupid contracts doesn't mean the Kings should. That said I'm with the writer, give Kopi whatever he wants so he'll remain a King for life."
losangeleskings,3e0k1k,PissOnEddieShore,10,Tue Jul 21 03:34:07 2015 UTC,"I think it was during the Doughty negotiations a few years ago that DL said something like ""look around the locker room and tell me who you want to take money from"". I'm paraphrasing, but DL basically said that he can't pay everybody top dollar, so if you want to play on a contender and keep the current team intact it would help if his players didn't hold out for top dollar contracts."
losangeleskings,3e0k1k,PissOnEddieShore,2,Tue Jul 21 04:17:26 2015 UTC,Question: Do you think Toews & Kane would have signed those giant contracts if they knew it would mean that Saad would have to be traded?   What if Lucic is an absolute stud for us next season? Maybe Anze takes less so Looch (and others) can fit under the cap...fingers crossed but not holding my breath.
losangeleskings,3e0k1k,LAKingBob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:39 2015 UTC,"I dont think they would have, no, but they know that that's what happens in a salary cap era. Clearly Saad was looking for 6m all along even though he said he would take a discount. they got a damn good return for him though.  i really hope that happens. I would LOVE a lucic-kopitar-gaborik line for like 4 or 5 seasons. we'll see what happens."
losangeleskings,3e0k1k,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:26:08 2015 UTC,"I think they knew what they were doing and the consequences of it.  At the time, their salaries combined took up about ~21 out of 69 million.  That's a little less than a third of the cap for two players.    I'm thinking maybe Dean can work his magic and get Kopitar to sign a hometown discount but from the look of things, it doesn't seem like it.  Lucic's cap current hit is 6 million so I don't think he would take significantly less than that.    On top of that the youngins (Pearson/Toffoli) are due for a raise the following year so I don't think the Kings can keep all four :("

losangeleskings,3e1c3q,CrispyLardon,6,Tue Jul 21 05:25:58 2015 UTC,"No way Pearson gets the C over Kopitar or Doughty. Pearson probably won't even get an A as a King. I love his game, but the Kings are a much different franchise now than when Brown was named Captain."
losangeleskings,3e1c3q,PissOnEddieShore,5,Tue Jul 21 05:54:09 2015 UTC,"Kopi if he wants it.  Doughty if he matures.  Toff if he sticks around long enough.  I would say Greener, since the ""C"" doesn't have to go to the best players--but he will probably retire before Brownie."
losangeleskings,3e1c3q,CrispyLardon,6,Tue Jul 21 05:04:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with the list but out of those three, I think it would be Toffoli.  Kopitar- Will probably retire after his next contract, probably around the same time Brown retires (he has a family) Doughty- Would make sense but needs to mature.  Plus he's an elite defensemen, with the cap era these days he might go towards different pastures. Toffoli- is talented (with a SC game winning assist) and wants to stay.  Could have waited to be offer sheeted and gotten paid but decided to sign a cap friendly bridge contract.  Shows maturity on his part.  But realistically it would probably go to Doughty next"
losangeleskings,3e1c3q,LAKingBob,2,Tue Jul 21 05:21:26 2015 UTC,I see doughty with an A. I can't see him losing that hot head of his. I also think it helps give him an edge to his game.
losangeleskings,3e1c3q,LAKBurner,3,Tue Jul 21 05:06:12 2015 UTC,"Doughty is an amazingly gifted player, but he's no leader. If we keep Lucic, I could see him getting Greene's A when he is gone. I think Kopi will stay an alternate. Maybe Toffoli? I don't know much about him off the ice and in the locker room."
losangeleskings,3e1c3q,GaboKopiBrown,2,Tue Jul 21 09:17:09 2015 UTC,I really cannot see us keeping lucic outside of an unprecedented cap increase. What salary we pay for him this year goes straight to kopi next year.
losangeleskings,3e1c3q,Syben,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I agree. I think unless he meshes super well and has a great season, we can't keep him. Even if we have the cap to offer him a similar contract that he currently has, we wouldn't be able to keep Toffoli and Pearson. If Voynov doesn't come back there might be some wiggle room but even then it's probably not feasible. He basically has to make himself so attractive to the Kings that we are willing to offload a big name to keep him."
losangeleskings,3e1c3q,doot_doot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be a dick but this is kind of silly and misunderstands how captaincy works. Pearson will never wear the C for us. We have franchise players who will wear it for many years before him and I don't see him being able to stay with us long enough to get there. I honestly don't even see him grabbing an A. Kopi will be our next C if we lose Brown somehow. Carter will likely grab an A at some point if he keeps up his leadership role. Greene is on his way out (meaning he won't be with us for a lot lot longer) so I think it goes to Carts after that if things keep going. Also an argument there for Dewey, but I still maintain that he's got some growing up to do before he's there. Remember, captaincy is not about being the best player. It's about leadership on, and I think most importantly, off the ice."
losangeleskings,3e1c3q,lordjedediah,2,Tue Jul 21 06:35:11 2015 UTC,I guess we disagree on Pearsons longevity.
losangeleskings,3dy69n,CrispyLardon,13,Mon Jul 20 14:27:13 2015 UTC,He's the absolute worst; I wish we would just get rid of him already.

losangeleskings,3dy69n,Omnivirus,5,Mon Jul 20 18:00:18 2015 UTC,"I think he's been the linchpin to our success and ought to be the next captain of the team. Best dman in the entire league and one of the most accomplished, probably deserved the Norris this year too."
losangeleskings,3dy69n,kiwirish,2,Mon Jul 20 16:17:03 2015 UTC,still bullshit that he lost. he had the most first place votes but lost because a bunch of fucking idiots left him off their ballots
losangeleskings,3dy69n,LAKingBob,3,Mon Jul 20 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with the key role Doughty plays on the team and his importance to the organization but I disagree with him being the next Captain. From everything that I have read (John Hoven and others) Drew isn't very close to being Captian material in regards to leadership. If you look at his attitude on the ice, it makes sense. He freaks out over penalties when he more often than not deserved them and has the occasional hissy fit. Both are not qualities you want in a captain. I think Kopi is by far the best choice after Brown."
losangeleskings,3dy69n,CaptainH00die,2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:52 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure if Kopi wants to be captain. He strikes me as the type of player who prefers to be left to his own devices rather than be the type of captain DL and Sutter want in LA.
losangeleskings,3dy69n,LAKingBob,2,Mon Jul 20 20:55:38 2015 UTC,That and it wouldn't surprise me if Kopi and Brown retired around the same time.

Yeah he plays with reckless abandon sometimes, and he'll occasionally make a dumb mistake, but this dude lives, breathes, and epitomizes what you want from a hockey player. You can just tell- he LOVES playing the game.  My only worry is that he slacks off with the conditioning, but my hope is that with his years in the league now, and knowing what it takes, he never backslides."
losangeleskings,3dy69n,herpaderpder,4,Mon Jul 20 20:28:38 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, even when Doughty plays his worst game he's still one of the best on the ice. Motherfucker can play."

losangeleskings,3drzjj,humbuckermudgeon,5,Sat Jul 18 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"Were are seeing the same thing happen with Richards--his concussions definitely had a major hand in his decline. I don't know what the NHL could do, short of changing the game tremendously. At least now there is better concussion protocols.  On the other hand, it's like, how could you not know you were fucking yourself up? It's like if a boxer or MMA fighter one day up and said he was confused about why he is permanently screwed up. So I don't think it's 100% the league's fault--he knew what sport he was playing all those years. But still, his point about being rushed out there so fast after getting concussed is valid and I am sure concussion information wasn't widely spread back then either."
losangeleskings,3drzjj,CrispyLardon,3,Sat Jul 18 22:08:10 2015 UTC,"In this particular and many other articles hockey players have mentioned that there's an implied peer pressure in the locker room.  Whether it's from their coaches, trainers, doctors, and/or teammates, hockey players are expected to get out on the ice as soon as they can, regardless whether they're completely rested or healed. So I can understand why so many hockey players decide to ignore symptoms and fight through the pain before it's too late.  I think now that there's better knowledge on what concussions can do to a player's long term health; maybe the league can begin implementing stricter procedures to handling possible concussion symptoms. I think I recall Towes getting boarded this past season and instead of going straight to the locker room, he tried to play it off, gets annoyed he was required to go get checked for a concussion, and tries to come back out on the ice that same night."
losangeleskings,3drzjj,LAKingBob,2,Sat Jul 18 22:46:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hockey culture would have to change some as well."

losangeleskings,3dpplq,Zanchbot,3,Sat Jul 18 06:39:40 2015 UTC,"A younger, hopefully less penalty-prone version of Stoll. I thought he did pretty well last season, he just needs to find more of a scoring touch if possible. Definitely a solid player though."
losangeleskings,3dpplq,LAKingBob,3,Sat Jul 18 12:02:51 2015 UTC,"I was excited to see some new blood into the lineup last year but Shore didn't really impress me.  And sure, even though his first and only goal last season was bounced off his skate, I was hoping it would open the floodgates of Shore (which didn't happen).     Other than his lack of offensive points, I don't recall him making any crucial mistakes last season. I'm looking forward to see him as a more permanent member in the lineup this upcoming season.  Maybe he just needed more TOI to get adjusted to the NHL and to develop more under Sutter's system."
losangeleskings,3dpplq,BagelzAllDay,4,Sat Jul 18 12:43:48 2015 UTC,Well let's hope Brown can continue to get goals from deflecting shots off Shore's skates for the whole season.
losangeleskings,3dpplq,nenright,4,Sat Jul 18 16:15:32 2015 UTC,"shore has been known as a mistake free player, which is why darryl praised him a lot last year, which he usually doesnt do for young players(muzz, martinez come to mind). I think his offense will take a step up with brownie and king this year. even if it doesnt he continues to be a very solid defensive #3 center who wins a fuckton of faceoffs."
losangeleskings,3dpplq,anexanhume,2,Sat Jul 18 16:23:19 2015 UTC,Hoping Shore will blossom with some mediocre scoring talent on his wings. Very disciplined penalty wise and had a better FO% than Stoll while he was here.
losangeleskings,3dpplq,nenright,2,Sat Jul 18 14:58:04 2015 UTC,wasnt it like 58% or so?
losangeleskings,3dpplq,EricBurger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:24:03 2015 UTC,"Shore really has to step up his game this year if he wants to stay on the roster. But hopefully he can become a solid third or fourth line center and for $600,000 a year that's a steal."
losangeleskings,3dpplq,nenright,3,Sat Jul 18 16:25:10 2015 UTC,"Shore doesn't really have to step up his game at all. He's basically guaranteed to play 3C or 4C because we really don't have anyone else who's better. He's also playing great defensively and winning like 56% of his faceoffs. While I think its likely his offense gets better next year, I doubt his presence in the lineup will suffer if it doesn't. Who else do we have? Nolan and Andreoff. Would you really rather see them playing than shore? I wouldn't.  EDIT: So I looked at hockey analysis stats. He had a 52.9% CF%, 52% GF%, and the third lowest GA60 on the team at 5 on 5. I hope his corsi improves to the average on the team(55%ish). But again I don't think that improvement is necessary for him to stay in the lineup."

Goddamn right it is Muzzin (1st) and Doughty (2nd)  *NOTE 1 - these are shallow stats Im posting that do not have in-depth research to confirm validity  **NOTE 2 - Hot Muzz has a higher PPG than Doughty  ***NOTE 3 - I love Hot Muzz"
losangeleskings,3dodar,CrispyLardon,0,Sat Jul 18 06:45:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and they got those numbers last year by not playing with each other, lol--Dewey played with Big Rig and McNugget a lot. They struggled hard as a pairing-- at least for awhile anyway.  Muzz's CF% went up last year when not with Dewey.  And when I say I like/think Muzz is better not with Dewey it's not in anyway a knock on Muzz--I love The Muzz. It's just last year--unlike previous years--Muzz seemed to do better without Brad Doty. And the numbers last year seem to point in that direction as well; and honestly it's a huge plus for Muzz, because it shows he wasn't being carried in previous seasons by Doughty."

losangeleskings,3dodar,Omnivirus,3,Sat Jul 18 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it boils down to Muzzin having 'I'm Keith Hernandez' moments with Doughty when he's on the ice with him. Drew has a way of making everyone look better, generally speaking.  When you pair Muzzin with someone like Greene, he knows he can't fuck around."

losangeleskings,3dlg1x,anexanhume,6,Fri Jul 17 06:36:31 2015 UTC,"I remember watching that game when he got his injury.  It was so surreal; watching him chase after the puck in one second and the next, watching him catch an edge (or tripped?) and slam into the boards ankle first.    Oh god I still remember the look of pain on his face as he limped towards the bench..."
losangeleskings,3dlg1x,Omnivirus,2,Fri Jul 17 07:46:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty much sums up my feelings while watching him ""skate"" back to the bench."
losangeleskings,3dlg1x,LAKingBob,4,Fri Jul 17 16:02:36 2015 UTC,Love his speed. It really opens the ice up for Carts and Toffoli. Those below-the-goal-line-off-a-rush feeds never get old.
losangeleskings,3dlg1x,Helios321,2,Fri Jul 17 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"Really unfortunate injury obviously. Hoping he comes back at 100%.  From what he did do in 2014/2015 - showed a nifty scoring touch, and excellent chemistry with Carter and Toffoli. I'm not sold on him as a top level offensive guy- that's something I reserve for Toffoli - but he can clearly be a 20 goal scorer every season barring injuries. Needs to round out his game a bit too."
losangeleskings,3dlg1x,nenright,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"Ooo yay, I can finally participate in a /r/lak discussion day (Until I have to go back to sleep)  I like Pearson especially his chemistry on that 70's line but I kind of feel he's a bit overrated.  Maybe I was just biased but Toffoli always caught my eye even though Pearson would score points more often than Toffoli did.  But after Pearson's injury, Toffoli has begun getting more attention so I'm pretty happy about that.  But I do feel that Pearson/Toffoli are the Kings' offensive future.  They seem to be one of the more consistent lines whereas the other lines are more defense-oriented.  What I worry about is; after their bridge contracts are up in two years, would the Kings be able to retain them both or even one of them?  They should be pretty well-known in the league so they could expect to receive great offers from other teams; offers the Kings' wouldn't be able to afford."

losangeleskings,3dibaz,LAKBurner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:13:48 2015 UTC,"Nothing happens until he finishes his jail and community service. Then his people have to ask the NHL to lift his suspension. The NHL had said they will conduct their own investigation after this has run its course, so I'd imagine he'll be suspended with pay while that goes on. After that, my guess is, the NHL will fire up the paper shredder, run his contract through it and shake his hand as they wish him a long a prosperous carrier in the KHL."
losangeleskings,3dibaz,Helios321,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:46:25 2015 UTC,"the NHL arent going to ban him......he is going to serve 30-40 days of his time be released the NHL will reactivate him considering he has effectively already served the longest suspension in NHL history, especially for a misdemeanor. Then the Kings will reactivate him because they have no DMen and he will play the season, may or may not have a good season and will then probably be traded away to another team at a good price rather than a flash sale where we get screwed."
losangeleskings,3dibaz,LAKBurner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The NHL doesn't care that he served his sentence or that it was the longest. The NHL is coming off one of its best seasons revenue-wise, collecting half a billion in expansion fees and growing the sport. They were praised for immediately suspending him when this happened. They will continue to seek praise by voiding his contract and wiping their hands of this guy, the last thing they want is to have a wife beater in their league. Ever since Ray Rice, DV is a hot button issue. They will rightfully determine that the public perception (no one is going to care that he plead no contest to a misdemeanor) of a guy who actually did jail time for beating his wife isn't worth the potential loss of a single sponsor. The SPC says it and Bettman is the final arbitrator... How do you think that'll work out? Slava blew it."
losangeleskings,3dibaz,Helios321,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:09:25 2015 UTC,Well there you go guys two people who disagree and being civil about it. I absolutely believe he will be reinstated after the immigration court decides not to deport him. The reason I do not think he will be terminated is because the NHL would not screw the kings like that. They are not going to wait until the end of the summer towards the end of off season trading to tell the kings oh btw one of the defenseman you are counting on and have not replaced or made moves to replace is not going to be allowed back. I believe Lombardi has already heard from the nhl and let sekera move on without too much fight because he knows and believes Slava will be back playing with the kings this year.
losangeleskings,3dibaz,LAKBurner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"I think the NHL terminating his contract would help the Kings because it would remove them from the process. Their hands would be clean, so to speak, if the NHL did it for them. They wouldn't have any public backlash or sponsor problems and would be free to pursue a new guy. I read a few places that Lombardi tried to resign Sekera, but couldn't get him under our cap. Personally, after 16 games and knee injury, he didn't deserve the money he got. But, it will be interesting to see what happens. I've read the earliest Slava could see actual game time is January."
losangeleskings,3dibaz,Helios321,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:07:04 2015 UTC,"His injury is an average recovery time of fourth months and he had surgery late may/early April so he would basically be fit by the start of the season, not January. Also the Kings have already essentially released that if Slava is cleared he will be playing for the team. I've already given my reasons on this sub why I am ok with that and I do believe he will finish this season as a King and depending on how fervently the fan base still opposes him wearing the sweater at the end of the season, he may even stay on another. I am about 95% confident though that he will play this season- 80% that he plays the whole year not getting traded right at the deadline.  Honestly, the Kings do not have enough defensive cover nor is there a current replacement available to throw D-men away at this point"
losangeleskings,3dibaz,LAKBurner,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:53:56 2015 UTC,"I can't disagree with you on the injury, the January date I mentioned wasn't my opinion, but what I've read from people in hockey operations and what their guesstimate would be. If I can find them again, I'll post the links. They were walking through the legal process timeline, the NHL process, it wasn't just related to him healing from the injury. From what I've read, if the NHL does let him back in, he has to face a suspension for what he did. The suspension he is currently under, isn't a punishment, it's keeping him off the ice while he goes through his legal problems. He still has to serve his jail time to appease the courts, when he's done and cleared his obligation to the County of Los Angeles, he still has the NHL penalty waiting for him."
losangeleskings,3dibaz,Helios321,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:29 2015 UTC,Much like with us courts I believe the nhl would consider it all as time served and wold not pile an extra penalty upon him. It would be a weird precedent to suspend him on the premise of you might have done something wrong and then suspend him again because yes you did do something wrong. His penalty will be assessed perhaps yes but it will all be considered time served.
losangeleskings,3dibaz,LAKBurner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:36 2015 UTC,"It's common to suspend people with pay during an investigation, it's not a punishment or judgement, it's just part of the process. He'll most likely get suspended without pay as punishment if the the NHL decides to let him play again."
losangeleskings,3dibaz,lordjedediah,3,Mon Jul 20 17:25:00 2015 UTC,So much for July 6th.   IF he is coming back to the Kings hopefully he is able to continue his ankle rehab behind bars.

losangeleskings,3djgqu,struckbyarhthmstick,8,Thu Jul 16 19:37:11 2015 UTC,"It just goes to show that, when it comes to drafting, it's best to pick a player that's best for your system as opposed to just getting the best player available.  Hickey is a very good player, but he was too small to fit our style of play and it showed.  Meanwhile, he goes to Long Island and fits in well there.  Also, both McDonagh and Shattenkirk had to leave the teams that drafted them in order to develop properly."
losangeleskings,3djgqu,wiseaus_stunt_double,4,Thu Jul 16 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"The thing is that Hickey both wasn't going to fit our system AND also wasn't the best player available.

losangeleskings,3djgqu,bryan_sensei,2,Fri Jul 17 22:17:07 2015 UTC,"Hickey was more a victim of a deep defensive core than a bust.

If it wasn't for the one-way contract, we would have never seen McBain in LA.  Teubert was a straight up bust."

losangeleskings,3di782,anexanhume,3,Thu Jul 16 15:47:46 2015 UTC,I don't know what any of that means :)
losangeleskings,3di782,KeanuReavers,4,Thu Jul 16 18:03:38 2015 UTC,"It's a graph with some scoring, shot generation and suppression, and goal impacts stats ranked into sectors (percentile marks).   Being above the rightmost line is very good, and you're in the top 20th percentile (roughly). That means you probably deserve 1st line (or top pair) usage if most of your stats are above that line.  In Jordan's case, nearly everything is below the 4th liner division. Players below that line are considered ""replacement level"" which means you can likely grab a free agent or AHLer that could do the job just as good if not better. His only bright spots are goals and shot suppression. For the goals, he's gotten lucky (3rd highest sh% - above Gaborik!!). For shot suppression, part of it is the Kings system and benefit from his linemates, even though deployment is controlled for to an extent.   For comparison, here is Kyle Clifford. You can see he's well above 4th line for everything and his shot suppression is very high. Given Nolan plays with Clifford, Nolan would benefit from Clifford. Trevor Lewis's numbers look very similar to Clifford's."

losangeleskings,3di782,inalasahl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:18:54 2015 UTC,Is it possible that his is so low because he doesn't get as much ice time?
losangeleskings,3di782,crass_bonanza,2,Thu Jul 16 19:58:21 2015 UTC,"All metrics are shown per 60 minutes, so they're automatically accounting for TOI. In fact, you'd expect someone with low TOI to probably have more time in the offensive zone since they're being carefully deployed. That should only boost the numbers if they're not adjusted for zone starts or competition."

losangeleskings,3di782,struckbyarhthmstick,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, his production is commensurate with his TOI.  I was really opposed to his re-signing when it happened. But with everything else that's gone on since, I'm liking it better. The Kings are going to have to bring up a lot of young guys in the next couple of years, many of whom are probably going to be depth guys or start out that way. A stable, hard-working influence, who understands how he fits on the team sounds like a good thing to have around developing players, if he's used in a healthy scratch/injury replacement role."
losangeleskings,3di782,RubeusShagrid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:11 2015 UTC,"I am not fully on board with HERO charts just yet, I still have yet to see what definitions are used to determine what ""liner"" they are.  Is it top some certain % should be 1st liner, next % should be 2nd, etc?  Also, is it averaged through your team or throughout the league?  As everyone on this sub should know, different teams have different scoring rates.  Same with possession metrics, it is very difficult for a guy like Nolan to increase any of the possession rates because the Kings are far and away the best possession team already."
losangeleskings,3di782,lordjedediah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:23 2015 UTC,"If you have questions, just ask @mimicohero on twitter.   The division lines are pretty clear, and you could measure it with a ruler to figure out exactly how they are binned.   Nothing is averaged in the manner you're talking about. All the forwards are ranked 1 through (approximately) 400 and that's how they're put on the chart.  Different teams do have different scoring rates, but nearly all of them are ahead of Nolan.  The issue with Nolan is that he makes everyone worse possession wise when he plays with them. He was the worst one on the team in that regard last year if you dont' count Voynov (the Kings had very bad possession numbers at the start of the year. I've seen talk of them supposedly trying some different things in that period)."
losangeleskings,3di782,RubeusShagrid,4,Thu Jul 16 21:12:53 2015 UTC,Nolan is cheap and an effective grinder. He excels at carrying the puck into the zone and won't hesitate to sacrifice himself for his teammates. I give him five Don Cherries out of five.
losangeleskings,3di782,RubeusShagrid,2,Thu Jul 16 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"There was one point in the 2014 run when he scored a pivotal goal for us. I can't exactly remember when, but pretty much my exact quote was;   I still kinda hate you Nolan, but now I kinda hate you a little less   He has flashes of being pretty decent, especially with possession, but still... mehhhhhh  Edit - wasn't during the cup run apparently. Who the hell knows now"
losangeleskings,3di782,Zanchbot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:43:40 2015 UTC,"There was no point in the 2014 run where Nolan scored a goal, let alone a pivotal goal.   He played in 3 games for a total of 8:09."

losangeleskings,3dgyro,CaptainH00die,13,Thu Jul 16 21:22:18 2015 UTC,My favorite goal by The Captain is his Game 2 deflection in double OT against New York. One of the nicest redirects I've ever seen and if you had to explain what to do in front of the net to score I would show someone this play. Brown really has a well rounded game and I hope he has a bounce back year.

losangeleskings,3dgyro,the_real_quaid,8,Thu Jul 16 06:15:40 2015 UTC,I like this idea and I love Dustin Brown!  Here is my favorite goal by him. I will never forget this goal or how much chemistry he and Kopitar had on that 2012 cup run.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X8bNUzRI3Pc
losangeleskings,3dgyro,crass_bonanza,4,Thu Jul 16 06:04:01 2015 UTC,For me it has to be one of his goals from this game.  This is the game after he was rumored to be on the trading block and we were in the middle of the 2012 doldrums.  Brownie came out and potted the hatty against Chicago and it really sparked the team.  You could tell how much those goals meant to him and this game was a huge step for the captain and the team.
losangeleskings,3dgyro,LOUD__NOISES,5,Thu Jul 16 17:42:23 2015 UTC,"Not even his own goal.  A minute after Brown scores the first goal in the 5 minute major, this happens. Even though later it was determined to be tipped in my Carter, I'm pretty sure Brown went Super Saiyan and decided to single-handedly drag the Kings to a Cup"
losangeleskings,3dgyro,horseradishfistfight,3,Thu Jul 16 22:08:40 2015 UTC,"2007 or 2008 maybe. Kings are down by 4 against the Stars in the third period. One of the goals, maybe the one that ties it, Kopitar launches this sick backhand over Farty Turdco. Kings ended up winning 6-5."

Blues fans still know what our pain was like pre-2012 so even though they hate us, I like them. Washington - Ovi, of course, and now Williams. Love their fans too, GDTs when the Caps play the Kings are always hilarious and fun. Nashville - They're fun to watch and even though they beat us a lot, games against them are almost always really crazy for one reason or another. Plus, Shea Weber is basically an older Doughty, gotta respect the guy."

losangeleskings,3dfgxb,CrispyLardon,2,Wed Jul 15 22:42:52 2015 UTC,He needs to really show us what he's got this season. Hopefully Sutter gives him some ice time. I hope the point sunk in last season: Sutter won't give you ice time unless you earn it; hopefully he comes back strong if he isn't a healthy scratch every game.
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,CrispyLardon,2,Wed Jul 15 21:27:18 2015 UTC,I want to actually see what this kid's got.
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,Skooma-Steve,2,Wed Jul 15 22:44:24 2015 UTC,Agreed. Last season was so underwhelming.
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,CrispyLardon,2,Wed Jul 15 23:13:01 2015 UTC,Check out some Ontario Reign games. He should  be getting plenty of ice time on their 3rd line.
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,aaron91325,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:58:48 2015 UTC,Nope. He has to clear waivers so the Kings won't risk sending him down.
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,lordjedediah,2,Thu Jul 16 03:52:30 2015 UTC,Risk? The guy couldn't get 4th line minutes on a team that missed the Playoffs. Which team in the league is eager to add this unproven aging prospect with very little upside? Every team in the league has their own Andreoff.
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,aaron91325,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:11:20 2015 UTC,Yea because the Kings missing the playoffs last year wasn't an anomaly or anything.
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,lordjedediah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:11:48 2015 UTC,How about the fact that he was skipped over and the Kings used Shore on the 4th line as soon as they could call him up?
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,aaron91325,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:13:56 2015 UTC,Why did they sign him or even extend a qualifying offer if he's such a useless scrub who can't even crack the Coyotes lineup?
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,lordjedediah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:42:56 2015 UTC,He's essentially making NHL level minimum wage. He's filler. He's proven that he can be a guy that gets 4th line minutes every 5th night and won't complain. The organization knows him and he has a good connection with some of the younger guys on the roster. He's a good little soldier. What he's not is a good hockey player.
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,aaron91325,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:11:39 2015 UTC,He's also a guy who wasn't waived a single time last season. He won't be playing in Ontario this season.
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,lordjedediah,5,Thu Jul 16 18:12:55 2015 UTC,"There's literally no one else in our system cheaper except for Brian O'Neil, who also has a chance at making the roster. So he'll ride the pine in a very team friendly way assuming he can't make his way into the lineup."
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,anexanhume,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:00:58 2015 UTC,With the AHL squad a 90 minute car ride away I doubt LA carries 23 on the roster. Why not keep them down in Ontario where they can actually gets some ice time. It's highly doubtful that O'Neill and/or Andreoff get claimed on waivers
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,aaron91325,2,Thu Jul 16 03:02:33 2015 UTC,"Well, he's going to have to step up his game considerably now."
losangeleskings,3dfgxb,Zanchbot,2,Wed Jul 15 23:14:33 2015 UTC,well its basically a minimum contract. (585k per year I think)

losangeleskings,3dct3o,nenright,2,Wed Jul 15 16:48:44 2015 UTC,Not relevant to it being a good idea or not. Moving Doughty to forward would be the worst idea ever. A  Norris caliber defenseman is far more valuable than even a top line forward. Taking DD off the blue line makes the Kings horrible.

losangeleskings,3dcudn,RubeusShagrid,9,Wed Jul 15 07:22:17 2015 UTC,This was the image that we were teased with when Lucic was traded to us.   Notice the SCF patch?   Foreshadowing? Let's fucking hope so.
losangeleskings,3dcudn,zattk94,6,Wed Jul 15 16:58:48 2015 UTC,I just hope he regains his form and preforms well. Maybe he comes back to win (hopefully again) but that depends on the Kopi and D situation.
losangeleskings,3dcudn,hobonia,3,Wed Jul 15 11:26:47 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about it more and more and as long as the anti-goal scoring force field that seems to surround this team doesn't affect him he could be a very very good fit here.  I've always thought the Bruins were the most similar team to the Kings in terms of style of play. It's why I wanted (and still want) to see a Kings/Bruins SCF. Lucic was arguably the most similar in play style to the Kings on that team before he was traded here.  Personally I was never a huge fan of the guy but that was entirely based off of stories I'd heard. I figure it's the same sort of thing for Brown in the eyes of other fans. I'm willing to give him a clean slate as he starts his time in LA.  If Lucic can come in and score even 15 goals this season (which shouldn't be too out of the question given the talent he's likely to be paired up with) this team will be in a very good spot.  Fun Fact: I lost power immediately before hitting save on this post. Thank god for RES.
losangeleskings,3dcudn,RubeusShagrid,4,Wed Jul 15 12:35:12 2015 UTC,Looch said in his jersey interview that he still thinks he has the ability to score 30 goals. Let's hope he splits the difference with you and scores 20ish. =]
losangeleskings,3dcudn,hobonia,4,Wed Jul 15 15:25:19 2015 UTC,"Well if we're being hopeful, let's hope he adds those totals together and slams a 45 goal season together"
losangeleskings,3dcudn,Anarchyisbliss,3,Wed Jul 15 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"Lol, I am okay with this plan."
losangeleskings,3dcudn,EricBurger,2,Wed Jul 15 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's what I'm hoping for.  I think 15 should be the minimum we expect but I'd hope for 20-25."
losangeleskings,3dcudn,paranoidpikachu,2,Wed Jul 15 17:14:28 2015 UTC,15 is realistic considering he is on the 2nd pp most likely
losangeleskings,3dcudn,anexanhume,3,Thu Jul 16 14:37:18 2015 UTC,"I think Lucic will be a good fit here. Will we re-sign him next year? I don't know. But for this season I think he'll add a some power to our top line with some scoring, and also be a bit of a protector to Kopi and Gabbo. He makes our team bigger and scarier to go up against.    I'm excited to see if this works out because Dean seemed to really want Lucic in LA. I wasn't happy about this trade when it first broke, but now I'm really pumped to have him here."
losangeleskings,3dcudn,nenright,2,Wed Jul 15 14:04:44 2015 UTC,"I think he'll add a some power to our top line with some scoring, and also be a bit of a protector to Kopi and Gabbo. He makes our team bigger and scarier to go up against.   Pretty much my thoughts on the matter. I know most people dislike Looch (and I can see why!) but I was honestly kinda pumped to have him on board. Just like with Gabbo when he was brought onboard, I'm excited to see him on the ice."
losangeleskings,3dcudn,Zanchbot,3,Wed Jul 15 22:46:25 2015 UTC,"I looked into Lucic's numbers and he used to be a good shot suppressor and generator right around the time the Bruins won the cup. As time has gone on, his shot suppression ability has waned but his shot generation ability has stayed healthy. This is heavily caveated by the fact that Krejci, his most common center, has been declining over the same timeframe. Last year, Krejci battled injury and Lucic's numbers suffered for it. However, Lucic did make all of his most common linemates better, so I think there is a lot of upside to him and he will likely help Kopi and Gabby generate more shots than with someone like Brown."
losangeleskings,3dcudn,RegisteredSock,3,Wed Jul 15 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"great point. he's also playing with kopitar now, who is undoubtedly better than krejci ever was, so i think he will benefit a lot from that. i think he'll probably put up 25 goals next to kopi and gabbo, and i dont think 30 is out of the question either. man, if we can get 50-60 goals from gaborik and lucic we will do really well"
losangeleskings,3dcudn,Alephz,2,Wed Jul 15 16:53:38 2015 UTC,"Assuming Lucic plays on the top line, his addition means the Kings are going to have (arguably) one of the best/scariest top 2 forward lines in the entire league....at least on paper. We'll see how that translates to real-world production when the new season begins."
losangeleskings,3dcudn,dark_knight_007,2,Wed Jul 15 23:18:41 2015 UTC,"On paper means nothing, the sharks were the better team on paper in the 2014 playoffs (according to tv analysts), and we all know how that turned out"
losangeleskings,3dav3c,anexanhume,8,Tue Jul 14 21:08:51 2015 UTC,I foresee a McNabb-Cernak pairing that will hurt people.
losangeleskings,3dav3c,lordjedediah,6,Tue Jul 14 21:31:51 2015 UTC,All the snippets and quotes I read during devo camp seem to sing this guys praises for how big and shredded he already is at his age so although this signing seems rather fast for most draft picks in the Kings system it's also not a shock. He won't make the big club but sounds like they already seem willing to let him loose in the AHL and see where it goes. With this defensive depth....who knows?
losangeleskings,3dav3c,RichieCski,2,Tue Jul 14 23:09:24 2015 UTC,"We had two AHL guys on ELCs leave this year (Miller, Bodnarchuk) and Forbort is assumed to move up to the NHL. That leaves space at the AHL level for some Monarchs (former Reign) guys to move up, or other guys to come up from their various systems.  Cernak is sort of unique in that he plays overseas, but isn't under a contract there next year. He also has a team with CHL rights. He's eligible to play in the AHL since he didn't play in the CHL. So he could literally go just about anywhere. May as well sign him to an ELC with that flexibility."

losangeleskings,3dav3c,zattk94,3,Wed Jul 15 03:20:06 2015 UTC,"This likely means he will play with the Reign in Ontario, though it is possible he could be demoted to Manchester for the Monarchs. Erie in the OHL is also a possibility since they selected him in the import draft. Seems extremely unlikely he has a shot at making the Kings roster."
losangeleskings,3dav3c,mecha_pope,2,Tue Jul 14 21:14:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on how they feel about him from camp and what they feel is best for his development, which is probably the AHL"

losangeleskings,3dav3c,zattk94,2,Wed Jul 15 04:30:45 2015 UTC,"He can be sent down at anytime but once they send him to Juniors there's no calling him back up.

Pickwick is a decent price option if we go late enough (ask for Brian).  There are some rinks further north (Simi) and south (Beach cities) of me, but that might exceed my willing drive distance.  Edit: Added some more helpful info."
losangeleskings,3dahxl,RubeusShagrid,2,Tue Jul 14 21:19:59 2015 UTC,"I used to play pickup in Simi, but it's been a while. They still have set times for pickup every week.

losangeleskings,3dahxl,Puckfiend,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:34:43 2015 UTC,"Do you know what Pano and Burbank go for?  The going rate seems to be around $300-350 for most places for an hour, and they do get cheaper if ice time is during their later or after hours.  I'll be going to stick time at TSC later this week, and I'll see what they run to rent ice time there during later hours.  I know someone who organizes pick-up games at TSC on Saturday nights; so, it's not out of the realm of possibility.  If I could get a Friday night game going there, that would be perfect for me since I already work in El Segundo and would provide incentive for me to stay late after work.  But, from most of the responses, it seems like up the Valley is probably the ideal option."

losangeleskings,3d9m7c,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,23,Tue Jul 14 16:02:56 2015 UTC,"We have no choice. It's up to the NHL if he is able to play or not. If they say he can play, we have no grounds to terminate his contract."
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,CrispyLardon,2,Tue Jul 14 16:05:34 2015 UTC,That's a great point. So I guess the major difference between Richards getting his contract terminated is he did something against the team that was stated in his contract (not showing up to practice I believe?) but Voynov's case is it was something outside of hockey and was a personal matter. Is there anyway the Kings could terminate his contract in the way they did Richards'?
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,CrispyLardon,10,Tue Jul 14 16:11:30 2015 UTC,Richards was way more than just missing practice; he also got caught with oxy at the Canadian border. Plus whatever else they are not telling us about. No one knows for sure exactly what the deal is yet with him.   Kings cannot do anything with Voynov because the court and NHL took it out of their hands immediately once he was arrested.   Edit: The only thing they could do was suspend him for his non-hockey related injury for some temporary cap relief.
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,CrispyLardon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:15:06 2015 UTC,Well isn't that another personal matter with Richards with the drug possession? Why would the drug charges affect his termination but Voynov's charges wouldn't?
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,anexanhume,3,Tue Jul 14 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"It's different because the NHL isn't taking a stance on Richards. But as soon as Voynov got arrested they immediately suspended him. There is many nuances at play here, and trying to compare the two cases is silly and in most aspects they are irrelevant to each other.   And on top of that we still don't even know if the Richards termination will go through."
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,BiohazardPixie,5,Tue Jul 14 16:28:30 2015 UTC,"One very important thing to consider with terminating a contract like Voynov's is the precedent it could set for the families of DV victims. If players know they'll be fired/banned for DV abuses, this only encourages their victims to be silent about the abuses, lest their spouse lose a source of income (that benefits them as well).   Regardless of what happens, hopefully this spurs the NHL to put a good program in place that has a multitude of family resources for situations such as this.   As for what the Kings should do - I don't know. Perhaps trading him is the best option? It will be very tough to see him back on the ice for me personally, but the impact to me or other fans is much less important than what's good for NHL families.  For one thing, I am glad that Voynov is required to attend counseling for a whole year. I earnestly hope that he can get his anger issues under control, though I don't know how realistic true change is. The fact that he seemed genuinely concerned and took her to the hospital himself makes me hopeful there's some humanity to him rather than a calculated effort to minimize the personal/professional damage he faced. I know that if the Kings are serious about promoting the family atmosphere they talk about, then the whole organization needs to show support to his family and establish the firm expectation that he better himself as a person. Hopefully he feels like he disappointed a lot of people that extends beyond his immediate family and he has a lot of mistakes for which to make amends."
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,thegetawayplan9,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"People can change, but they don't change without making and effort and going through the steps. Voynov has to do this, so like you that makes me hopeful for him, for the sake of his family more than the sake of our team right now.  I just hope the program is not the sort of thing that is half assed and just requires him to sit in a place and keep to himself for the time.  As for trading him, I'm with you, kind of at a loss as far as the best move goes.  For what it is worth, I think I'm glad this happened here and not in a different state or country.  This whole thing would have been dealt with a lot faster and more likely swept completely under the rug in most other places the moment his wife refused to cooperate."
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,RichieCski,4,Tue Jul 14 22:22:43 2015 UTC,These aren't comparable in my opinion.   There's a lot more that we don't know about Richards incident it seems.   Also it's very likely that Richards could be charged with a felony as opposed to Voynov getting a misdemeanor. Unless the immigration court deports Voynov or somehow he gets a restriction so he can't travel to Canada. The Kings have zero grounds to terminate his contract unfortunately.
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,CrispyLardon,3,Tue Jul 14 16:47:25 2015 UTC,"Solid opinions on a lot of things and hypothetical situations in this thread but nobody answered the OP's question of how would you actually feel if the Kings were at this sort of crossroads and chose one option over the other. Personally, I would have a hard time with seeing him out there. I do believe in second chances for everyone but given the fact that now we have all ""withheld judgement until all the facts come out"" and indeed they have, it would just make me really uneasy fully supporting him every time he steps out on the ice unless there are demonstrative steps made on his end to prove his a different person moving forward"

So why would any of us answer a question to something that wont ever come to pass?  Now, if he wanted to know how we would feel if we are forced to keep him, he could have asked that. But he didn't; he asked something else entirely."
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,RubyRhod,2,Tue Jul 14 18:40:07 2015 UTC,My question was if the Kings got the option to terminate his contract and they decide to keep him how would you feel given the previous events with Richards. This brings up the point that we only care about Voynov because he's good and Richards we want to get rid of a bad contract. That was what I asked.
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,BagelzAllDay,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"There is a huge difference of you saying ""when"" instead of ""if."" You said ""when the kings are given the chance."" This is why no one answered your question and instead told you that the choice is out of our hands. You wrote it like a statement of fact that the Kings were going to do that.  If you wanted to ask a hypothetical question you should have been a bit more clear on that. Your title as it stands now means something completely different than what you are now asking in this reply.  But now that your question is clear, I can tell you that if you read some of the previous threads about Voynov you will get all the answers you want in terms of how we feel about him; it has been discussed at great lengths and most of the threads are sitting on the second or third pages--but are easy to find if you are interested.  I can however tell you that the popular opinion is most definitely not this:    we only care about Voynov because he's good"
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,lordjedediah,2,Tue Jul 14 21:48:13 2015 UTC,"Also of note, we're still not off the hook for the Richards contract yet. The NHLPA still has yet to say if they are going to file a grievance."
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,lordjedediah,3,Tue Jul 14 16:29:55 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll forget..?
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,CrispyLardon,2,Tue Jul 14 16:33:10 2015 UTC,Let's hope they forget for 46 more days.
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,BW4LL,2,Tue Jul 14 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"If they NHLPA files a grievance it will likely be settled. The NHL will have the option of punishing the Kings for cap circumvention but the NHL is also aware of why Richards contract was terminated.   IMO, if the league felt that Lombardi and Co. didn't have a valid reason to terminate the contract they would have punished them already."
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,PissOnEddieShore,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:36:48 2015 UTC,I agree. All this silence doesn't bode well for Richards. If the Kings were out of line I feel like we would have heard about it the day of.

I'm not like most online were I act like I'm perfect, granted I haven't done anything like Slava but still not perfect. I want to believe people can change and if he makes a committed effort to change then good.   Also I'm gutted about Richards, hope he gets help if he needs it. Ill never forget what he did for this team."
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,nenright,2,Tue Jul 14 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"I believe that what Voynov did was terrible, but I also believe in second chances. He has already served the longest suspension in NHL history and he is paying his debt to society (I hope he sees the errors of his acts and volunteers time and money to DV charities). I am OK with him coming back, but if Slava slips up just this much, he should be sent to Siberia.  I think Mike Richards got multiple chances. He may have even refused DL's request to enter NHLPA rehab (speculation). Drug addiction is a terrible thing, hopefully he can get his life and career together. He still has a chance to get back on track, just not in a Kings uniform."
losangeleskings,3d9m7c,doot_doot,2,Wed Jul 15 06:14:36 2015 UTC,"Legality and contractual stuff aside, I do not want Voynov to be a King anymore. I think his shit will poison a very family friendly locker room, and I don't want to cheer for goals scored by him or be happy about great plays he makes. I don't want to hear them say Slava Voynov at Staples Center. What he did is not okay. Trade him away, or better yet, I hope he has to leave the country.

losangeleskings,3d5her,sandypheet,18,Mon Jul 13 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"Jon Rosen tweeted this, and I agree wholeheartedly:  Lucic - Kopitar - Gaborik  Pearson - Carter - Toffoli  King - Shore - Brown   Clifford - Lewis - Weal  Top 6 is pretty straight forward.  For the bottom 6, Brown drops to the 3rd line where he will stay for the season.  Shore will be the 3rd line center. The Kings see him as not only Stoll's replacement, but the best player for a 3C. They've been waiting for him to fill this role, and I think he's ready. He's also way better than Andreoff.   King is a 3rd line player. Also, Lewis is more valuable as a 4th line center than as a 3rd line winger. He's a great 4C and he would probably only be an average 3LW.  Lewis is a better C than Clifford, so Clifford will be on the wing. And the left side is his natural side so that's even better.  Finally, I think the Kings will bring up Jordan Weal and have him play 4th line time. He's ready for the NHL, and another year in the AHL isn't gonna do him any good. I think the Kings really need to use him already.  For the healthy scratches, I would say Nolan and Andreoff. I also think the Kings will bring up Brian O'Neill (27 year old AHL MVP this year) for a 13th foward. I wouldn't be surprised if one of these 3 gets moved.  I think this is the most complete offense the Kings have had in a while. Everyone's spot makes sense. No one is over/under reaching in their position."

losangeleskings,3d5her,anexanhume,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:58:51 2015 UTC,Definitely. Not throwing every other player to plug the top line with Kopitar and Gaborik will really help out the other lines.

losangeleskings,3d4ilt,itanitarek10,3,Mon Jul 13 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"Just in general, he needs to pick up his game from last season. If he wants the 10 mil a year contract, he's going to have to start scoring more than 20 goals a season."
losangeleskings,3d4ilt,RubyRhod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"Excluding the lockout season, this season was the first time he had under 20 goals - ever (even in 2006-07 he managed 20 goals). So yeah, this year was bad.   Nonetheless, he was still the points leader for the team (64 pts) trailed by Carter (62 pts) and Toffoli (49 pts) and held a pretty respectable Shooting-% at 11.9%. He just needs to start pulling the trigger again; besides this year (and excluding the lockout season), the only other time he was under 200 shots in a season was 2006-07...with 193. So yeah...don't know what it was this year but something was way off.   All in all, I'm not worried, I think he'll be ready for a big bounce back this season."
losangeleskings,3d4ilt,swisschez,3,Mon Jul 13 18:45:54 2015 UTC,And his shootout % was about 10% and that's inexcusable. But let's all close our eyes and try to forget the shootouts from last season.
losangeleskings,3d4ilt,RubyRhod,2,Mon Jul 13 18:55:18 2015 UTC,Shootouts? I dont remember any shootouts....not sure what they even are.
losangeleskings,3d4ilt,swisschez,2,Mon Jul 13 18:57:11 2015 UTC,Neither do the Kings
losangeleskings,3d4ilt,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:33:55 2015 UTC,"well the reason he stopped shooting is because he finally has a goal scorer he can pass to. Last year he had 29G 41A in the regular season and then 5G 21A in the playoffs. Thats where he stopped shooting and became more of a passer. Now that he has lucic and gaborik on his wings we should expect more passing from him, not less. I would like to see 20G 60A next year and let lucic and gaborik get the goals.  EDIT: im not saying i like that he doesnt shoot much anymore. there were times when he tried to force a pass last year instead of taking the shot himself. but i'm okay with him passing alot as long as he doesnt force passes when he should shoot."
losangeleskings,3d4ilt,nenright,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:05:14 2015 UTC,"well the reason he stopped shooting is because he finally has a goal scorer he can pass to.    Don't know that I'd agree with you there.   When you see someone as goddamn good as Kopitar drop from averaging 200+ shots over ~82 games each season (excluding lockout season) to 134 shots...thats more than just Kopi having an actually talented winger he can feed, theres something else.  No idea what it is, but given Kopi's scoring history/performance throughout his career and his incredible skill - 16 goals is just flat out bad.   So, in a burst of optimism, I raise you your 20G and 60A and say Kopi is gonna go for 35G and 55A   #AllHailRaccoonJesus"
losangeleskings,3d4ilt,swisschez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:14:09 2015 UTC,I would much rather have 35G 55A than 20G 60A. I would also love to see doughty put up 60-70 points next year like we know he can.

He does everything well and is the heart of the Kings' great puck possession. With two great shot generators Lucic and Gaborik, our first line should be just as big an offensive threat as that 70's line.  Just remember Anze, shoot the puck yourself once in a while."

losangeleskings,3d4ilt,Omnivirus,5,Mon Jul 13 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"He had a disappointing year to me. The numbers were there for the most part, but he didn't pass the eye test.  He seemed distracted and a little bit lethargic- really let the play come to him rather than actively create and push the pace. He had a few weeks of brilliance down the stretch when things were getting tight, but it wasn't enough.  And the total lack of shooting was puzzling. I get that having Gabbo on his wing meant he wanted to serve it up a bit more, but still, Trevor Lewis outshot our #1 center. This is not good.  Bottom line to me- Anze will probably be looking for $10M per year after this season. He needs to up his game and not be seen as the 'underrated centre out West'. He can and should be in the same breath as Crosby, Toews, et al."
losangeleskings,3d4ilt,Pen2Paper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:42:52 2015 UTC,I hope we can sign him this year closer to $9.5m/year for the max 8 years but hope is a strong word.

Brown would most likely retire (as he'll be 40). You could make an argument for Kopitar or Doughty but I can't see Kopitar staying with the Kings for another 10 years (he already has a family), and Doughty is one of the best defensemen in the league, he'll probably move on to greener pastures.  Toffoli on the other hand has shown he wants to stay with the Kings and has shown the dedication/maturity regarding of how cap stricken the Kings are. He could have waited to be offersheeted and get paid but chose to sign a cap friendly deal of 2 years ~3 mil a year. The man is talented (with a SCF game winning assist) and stays relatively healthy all season (except for when he had mono for a good handful of games last season)"
losangeleskings,3d231h,LAKingBob,11,Sun Jul 12 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"what do you mean move on to greener pastures. i dont see any reason why doughty would leave. he loves it here. he's wanted to play for the kings since he was little, and there's no way dean lets him go after this current contract is up"
losangeleskings,3d231h,nenright,3,Sun Jul 12 23:30:56 2015 UTC,"With the salary cap and new upcoming talent, I think it'll be more and more rare for players to play for one team their entire careers.  Just look at what happened this past off-season; Bruins traded Hamilton (predicted to be their next franchise defensemen) and Lucic (The man was essentially the soul and spirit of the Bruins), Blues trading away Oshie (a year after his performance in the Olympics), and with the Blackhawks trading away Sharp who was part of the core that won them three cups in the past several years.    As much as I would like to have Doughty stay as a King for the rest of his career, I think it's not very likely considering how cap stricken the Kings already are with upcoming new talent expecting to get paid (rightfully so if I might add).  Edit: Don't know why you got downvoted, I thought it was a legitimate question/response. Aren't we all Kingsfans here?"
losangeleskings,3d231h,CrispyLardon,6,Sun Jul 12 23:45:06 2015 UTC,"i see what you're saying, but hamilton didnt want to be in boston and thats why they traded him, sharp is 34 and is not a franchise player like doughty, kane, toews. Lucic trade i guess they just wanted to get something for him for their mini rebuild, and oshie is way overrated and overpaid, and i'm pretty sure he had a terrible playoffs. im not sure about the lucic or oshie trades, but i understand the sharp and hamilton ones.   the thing is that Doughty, the best all around defenseman in the nhl, will only be 28 or so when his contract expires, will most definitely get at least a 7 year deal. guys like doughty dont come around very often, and you can't just let him walk in the prime of his career. although now that i think about it i see your point in that he may not be re-signed after his next contract is over as he'll be 35ish. but i think he'll be given the captaincy after brown"

The gap between Dwight King's best play and worst play is pretty small. He's not gonna dazzle anyone, but at the same time he will never be a liability.   Now that our top 6 is sorted out, he fits in permanently on the 3rd line, which is right where he belongs. Him, Shore, and Brown are good depth."

Yeah, Sekera fixes our defensive issues, but he's expensive for a top 4.  Lucic not only completes our first line, but he completes the top 6 and in a way our bottom 6. We for once have 4 fully realized offensive lines. I know defense is important, but having 12 players exactly where they should be is something we've never had in recent memory.   Even if he IS a rental, I'm fine with it. We need to win another one with this core, and a 13th, Jones, and Miller weren't gonna help with that."

I don't know what he's done to give you that opinion, but my dealings with him has given me the opposite view.  Besides, I know a bunch of stuff he says might be off-putting, but it's tongue-in-cheek.  On top of that, we all are guilty of saying something that would be considered offensive to opposing fanbases.  Everyone on /r/hockey is guilty of it -- myself included.  Hell, I know I'm worse than Dustin Brown's knee and Jarret Stoll's hit on Vlasic on /r/SanJoseSharks for some of things I say about the Sharks on /r/hockey.

I've loved watching the chemistry he's got with Kopi, he's always driving the net and making smart plays to get the goal, whether that goal is pretty or just a tip in due to good positioning. He even finished the season without any major injuries, so let's hope that continues as well."
losangeleskings,3cwqn6,paranoidpikachu,2,Sat Jul 11 15:19:52 2015 UTC,I always get scared when Gabbo takes a big hit. Him being injury prone is stressful because it always feels like he is out for a long time each time.
losangeleskings,3cwqn6,Omnivirus,2,Sat Jul 11 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"Still playing well for his age. I think he will age better since we really just need his shot and speed as we get physical stuff from just about everyone else. His injuries seem to have declined to so knock on wood that continues.  Adding Lucic to the top line is really gonna help Gaborik. He'll be playing on his natural wing, and Lucic will take care of in front of the net stuff so Gaborik will be free to roam open ice and take shots."
losangeleskings,3cwqn6,TheEw0kGamer,2,Sat Jul 11 16:32:12 2015 UTC,All I can say is I was excited when we got him and I still get excited when I remember he's a King.
losangeleskings,3cwqn6,Omnivirus,2,Sat Jul 11 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"I'm hopeful that the addition of Lucic to the top line gives him some room to shoot for 40 again. He still has the speed and he very clearly still has that incredible shot. If Lucic can be the scary power forward type, it should clear up room for Anze/Gabbo to make some sweet music.  I've also been impressed with his defensive zone play."
losangeleskings,3cwqn6,TheEw0kGamer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:23:10 2015 UTC,A lot of big goalscorers have shown surprising defensive awareness on the Kings. Carter has also been very good in his own end.
losangeleskings,3cwqn6,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:22:51 2015 UTC,With Carter it was more a question of laziness. I never sensed Gaborik was lazy in his prior stops- just that he was never asked to be responsible defensively.

I watch old playoff highlights a lot and so many times Clifford was out with the top 2 lines and he did so many little things that led to goals. He drove to the net and tied up a defenders stick on Kopitars goal in game 7 against SJ and on Martinez cup winning goal. Also took a hit and made a play scoring an assist on 2 goals during game 7 against the Ducks.  Clifford has improved so much and is everything I love in a bottom 6 forward. It's very cliche but he always works hard and when he gets a opportunity to play with top guys he doesn't look out of place. Love #13

Obviously his job is not scoring, but he's got a surprising amount of skill and defensive responsibility for someone who is considered by outsiders to be ""just an enforcer"". He makes our 4th line something that other teams should fear - that's our Colonel."
losangeleskings,3csl7u,Zanchbot,2,Fri Jul 10 21:06:50 2015 UTC,"I loved yelling ""C'MON BIG RED DOG!"" every time he was on the ice. I've enjoyed him being on our team."
losangeleskings,3csl7u,heathrawr182,2,Fri Jul 10 18:21:40 2015 UTC,I'm almost certain that he's a vampire.
losangeleskings,3csl7u,deadmicedance,2,Fri Jul 10 23:05:12 2015 UTC,He's good for a bottom 6 position. Maybe slightly over payed. Wouldn't be heartbroken if he was traded if it got a good return.
losangeleskings,3csl7u,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:44:55 2015 UTC,"For me, Cliffy is my favorite developing King. He continuously steps his shit up. Sure, he isn't as flashy as Pearson or Toff, or possess their level of technique, but there's just something about the kid that I really respect--he seems to be full of drive and grit and the need to learn and get better; I really  enjoy watching him play.  I hope we keep him for a long, long time."
losangeleskings,3csl7u,DukeSpaghetti,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:08:59 2015 UTC,He's actually one of my favorite players on the team. Solid player that you can count on every night. Plays his heart out. He's never really out of position and he can ring the bell if he needs to. Plus he's got a very scary mean face
losangeleskings,3crcl4,EricBurger,3,Fri Jul 10 03:50:35 2015 UTC,So pumped for Reign games.
losangeleskings,3crcl4,CrispyLardon,3,Fri Jul 10 03:52:14 2015 UTC,Fun fact: he is related by marriage to Quick and former King Matt Moulson (who is Quick's brother-in-law). That's why those two were seen together at Monarchs games in the playoffs.
losangeleskings,3cr3mt,humbuckermudgeon,7,Fri Jul 10 02:32:49 2015 UTC,It's a good day when I can use this twice.

losangeleskings,3cr3mt,CrispyLardon,2,Fri Jul 10 22:37:26 2015 UTC,I got to meet him when he was up here for that tournament. Instantly became one of my favorite people.
losangeleskings,3cqg01,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,12,Thu Jul 9 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"Both.  They're trying to reach an extension with Kopitar right now. Once they get that, they'll have some idea how much they can spend and will probably pick up some D."
losangeleskings,3cqg01,LOUD__NOISES,5,Thu Jul 9 23:42:55 2015 UTC,"They can still negotiate an extension with Kopitar without it affecting the cap since it won't go into effect until next year.  If his new cap puts over next year's cap, it just means that someone else like Lucic isn't coming back."
losangeleskings,3cqg01,wiseaus_stunt_double,2,Fri Jul 10 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"They can still negotiate an extension with Kopitar without it affecting the cap since it won't go into effect until next year.   I know, I meant that they'll at least know what Kopitar's new cap hit will be so they can sign other players without worrying about him.  And honestly, I don't think Lucic is coming back 2016-2017 anyway."
losangeleskings,3cqg01,LOUD__NOISES,3,Fri Jul 10 01:28:25 2015 UTC,"Why do people keep saying this? We lost a first for Sekera to try to win it all last year and that was bad enough I can't see Lucic being a rental with everything we gave up. Unless he has a bad year I'd think they'd let someone else go (Martinez, Greene, maybe even Muzzin) before they let Lucic walk."
losangeleskings,3cqg01,dalbtraps,2,Fri Jul 10 06:55:23 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. We now have Lucic so it would be better to try and keep him if he has a good season with us.
losangeleskings,3cqg01,Lloitaer,2,Fri Jul 10 07:57:08 2015 UTC,A long term contract for Toffoli and Pearson is more important than signing Lucic.
losangeleskings,3cqg01,RubyRhod,2,Fri Jul 10 16:33:34 2015 UTC,"They both got signed already recently? The cap is constantly changing and since you're not going to sign them to another contract for 2 years it's not really a priority yet. Signing Kopitar is the #1 thing Lombardi is concerned with, after that gets done he'll start making decisions on what to do with the rest of his assets."
losangeleskings,3cqg01,dalbtraps,2,Fri Jul 10 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"I'm saying signing Kopitar is #1 but then after this season, then Toffoli and Pearson have only 1 year left on their cheap contracts. Considering Tarasenko got 8 years, 7.5 mil, we're going to have to sign something similar in order to keep them, especially since they did us a solid by signing the bridge deal in general.   Next summer Lucic will be a UFA. Imagine if we re-sign Lucic and don't make the playoffs in the 2017 season, we'll be sellers instead of buyers which means selling Toffoli or Pearson to get a huge return (more for Toff). And then if we don't sell, then we can't sign them because Lucic is taking up a bunch of space. It just doesn't make sense.   Lucic is a 1 year rental to try to win the cup."
losangeleskings,3cqg01,RubyRhod,2,Fri Jul 10 17:43:48 2015 UTC,"I don't really see Toff ever being traded, but even if we did sell Pearson why is that bad? They could leverage his value to build around the veterans depending on how Lucic fits with the team. As I said if he doesn't do well this season it's a moot point, but if Lucic continues to be the player he was for Boston alongside a reinvigorated Kopi with a new contract that is just as valuable as Pearson imo. The only difference is Pearson would have longevity (in theory) since he's young, but that is something we could offset by getting a young roster player in return in a hockey deal a la JMFJ for Carter."
losangeleskings,3cqg01,dalbtraps,2,Fri Jul 10 19:06:37 2015 UTC,My point is that Pearson and Toffoli are a better long term plan that just Lucic. But I guess we'll see how well it goes this season and go from there. It could be disastrous from the beginning or amazing and I'll want to eat my words.
losangeleskings,3cqg01,RubyRhod,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:00:16 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying Kopi's contract extension is independent of our current cap situation right now.  So, however we fill this year's roster has little bearing on the negotiation But, yeah, you're right, we need to get his contract extension done ASAP.  Pretty much everyone has the feeling that Lucic is a rental."
losangeleskings,3cqg01,wiseaus_stunt_double,2,Fri Jul 10 01:40:39 2015 UTC,"A pretty damn expensive rental.  Just like Sekera, god damn it..."

losangeleskings,3cqg01,LAKBurner,2,Fri Jul 10 01:19:28 2015 UTC,We just got Enroth -- I think he fits the bill of being a backup.
losangeleskings,3cqg01,wiseaus_stunt_double,3,Fri Jul 10 01:41:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed. From what I read, they had no plans after signing a backup, so we'll just have to wait and see"
losangeleskings,3cqg01,LAKBurner,2,Fri Jul 10 01:56:20 2015 UTC,They are probably saving a chunk of that in the event that they have to pay Voynov.

losangeleskings,3cq3hc,RichieCski,2,Thu Jul 9 22:42:26 2015 UTC,If it is truly being played in St. Louis I just want to hear when the dates would be and could probably make it work. I play about 3x a week in the Bay Area  Edit: Preferably sometime around Halloween when LA is in town (11/3) or near 2/18 :)  also it would make much more sense logistically if the western subs did some sort of regional rather than going all the way out there for a one off type thing. So TSC/Lakewood/Sharks Ice play-in would be a great call
losangeleskings,3cq3hc,RichieCski,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:32:46 2015 UTC,"Halloween in the Bay Area would be boss -- I'm dressing up as Tommy Wiseau, and romping through SF tossing a football two feet while in costume would be hilarious.  That reminds me: where's my water bottle?  We don't have any dates of any sort set, and everything is preliminary, but I would be more open for something more regional and then the winners moving on to the Finals --  it makes more sense to me to do it that way.

Leading the team in goals, second in points, centering a line of our future scorers, playing all 82 games, and all this for a decently low cap hit considering. For his position and expectations, I think he had the best season of any King last year.   We need him to really be on top of his game this year when Toffoli and Pearson take charge in terms of scoring. A healthy 70s line would probably be the best thing to happen for us."
losangeleskings,3co6b6,Max_Power_11,3,Thu Jul 9 18:16:45 2015 UTC,The hype is real.
losangeleskings,3co6b6,Sleazy_T,3,Thu Jul 9 19:07:41 2015 UTC,I think Carter really stepped up last year.  Being on a line with TP and TT really elevated his game.  I hope we see a career season out of him this year now that all the distractions of Richards will be gone.

losangeleskings,3cmonl,RubyRhod,2,Thu Jul 9 07:53:12 2015 UTC,Was a huge reason why we didn't make the playoffs. Certainly not the only one though. Voynov. Richards. Martinez being out for 2 months.
losangeleskings,3cmonl,heathrawr182,2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:22 2015 UTC,I got pretty excited when they showed up on the screen last night. It seems like Toffoli goes to a lot of dodger games. I've seen him there three times within the last month probably.

losangeleskings,3cm1ks,BlueApple10,2,Thu Jul 9 03:10:10 2015 UTC,At the very least he's entertaining.
losangeleskings,3cm1ks,GaboKopiBrown,2,Thu Jul 9 04:04:10 2015 UTC,His ice bucket challenge is still was one of my favs.
losangeleskings,3cm1ks,MagicArc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:03:09 2015 UTC,What's funny is that he may be bad at hockey but he's still better than most to be able to play professionally. Like if we were both on the ice he'd be Crosby (skill-wise) and I'd be Paul Bissonnette haha.
losangeleskings,3cm1ks,ereckstein,3,Thu Jul 9 15:57:47 2015 UTC,He's only bad at hockey when compared to the top .00001 percent.  That's still pretty fucking good.
losangeleskings,3cm1ks,GaboKopiBrown,3,Thu Jul 9 19:14:40 2015 UTC,I like him. I am glad if he's in the AHL it's for us. I hope he gets an invite to the kings camp

losangeleskings,3cmd8r,dark_knight_007,16,Thu Jul 9 01:01:11 2015 UTC,"IIRC Sutter was locked out of the locker room during a road trip following a loss to I thiiink the Lightning sometime in February? So it wasn't like the ending note of the season with him by any means, it just didn't really come out until our season crashed and burned properly.  Lombardi didn't seem concerned about it, I didn't hear about a repeat incident and Sutter didn't make any kind of statement about how pissed he was or not either.  Honestly I'm not surprised either. Your coach is likely to always be the person you dislike the most. They point out the things you do wrong, the stupid penalties you take, they can punish you by reducing your minutes, effectively they are like another parent who is frequently yelling at you and the like in front of all of your siblings. I'm sure comparisons are drawn, 'Toffoli can do this, he is xyz years old and has been in the NHL for only blah blah you are xyz years old with 10 seasons under your belt' type things.   I don't think the Kings will be cutting ties with him, not over that anyway, IMO.   Willie Mitchell said it really well when he was asked after being traded signed with the Panthers. Sutter is a great coach that he can respect  and he usually makes good calls for the team and the guys, but he hated him while he was being coached by him, or something similar to that affect."
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,BiohazardPixie,7,Thu Jul 9 01:17:06 2015 UTC,"I think Sutter even said something to the effect that sometimes those player only meetings need to happen so things can be aired out within the team.  Also, Willie signed in Florida as a free agent, no trade."
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,hopesfail,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah same concept, just a bit of a brain fart."
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,BiohazardPixie,7,Thu Jul 9 01:53:50 2015 UTC,The Kings beat Tampa Bay both times they played last season.  The initial report was full of inaccuracies and was pretty much dismissed by anyone who knew what actually happened.
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,seabass4507,3,Thu Jul 9 02:52:31 2015 UTC,"good to know, i guess if players are ok with it they should be fine, thanks for the info."
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,nenright,2,Thu Jul 9 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"yeah, all the players said they wanted to do it to hold each other accountable. it actually happened against florida, not TB, and it was then followed by an 8 game win streak."
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,alljake,8,Thu Jul 9 03:42:15 2015 UTC,"Sutter isn't going anywhere until he wants to.  He's tough on players, but nobody in the league is a better ""game day"" coach.  He is amazing at figuring out who is having a good night/off night and juggling accordingly.  I also assume John Stevens is the coach-in-waiting for whenever he does leave, so we're stylin' no matter what.  Love the whole staff."
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,BlueApple10,3,Thu Jul 9 01:37:17 2015 UTC,"I loved what we did with Stevens. When other teams wanted to poach him, we signed him to a contract extension and made up a random title for him. He went from assistant coach to associate head coach. I thought it was a nice statement to the rest of the league."
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,ThatKingsFan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:05:28 2015 UTC,It really was. Loves me some John Stevens. We're fortunate to have him.
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,CrispyLardon,10,Thu Jul 9 17:57:53 2015 UTC,All accounts say that the locker room incident was blown out of proportion--which is why nothing was said about it. It basically boiled down to a rough season on top of a film crew during a very rough patch and the boys just wanted to handle it themselves.
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,Syben,2,Thu Jul 9 01:38:49 2015 UTC,"Their actions don't shock me at all. There is only so much a coach can do and past that point it is all on the players. Having played sports all my life, there have been situations where we have done something similar. It's not a dislike for your coaches but knowing that it's up to yourselves to fix the issues. Given the Kings strong leadership I think this is the most likely scenario."
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,Pen2Paper,2,Thu Jul 9 02:09:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah from what I've gathered from the articles and comments, Sutter had left after the game, the guys locked the doors for a player's only type meeting and Sutter came back to find the doors were locked. Not a big deal. They ripped off 8 straight wins after that."
losangeleskings,3cmd8r,KingsfanMDJ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:29:59 2015 UTC,"The shortest version of the truth here is, they weren't locking Sutter out, they were locking everyone out."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,CrispyLardon,23,Wed Jul 8 12:43:37 2015 UTC,"Brownie, Brownie, Brownie... what are we going to do with you? Your jersey might be in the rafters one day but you're having trouble cracking 20 goals and 20 assists, which isn't the world to ask. The hits dropped off, the presence wasn't there like it has been. ""Steady as she goes"" is great but she's going too slow.   I hope this offseason revitalizes this guy more than any other King except Kopitar. He's the best C in the Pacific but far from a good player today."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Pen2Paper,13,Wed Jul 8 14:30:36 2015 UTC,Agreed. Thankfully in a postseason interview he said he was using a nutritionist and hitting the gym daily; hopefully he also practices his skating as well.   There is no other King I want to see invigorated more this upcoming season than Brownie--mostly because I am not ready to see him go and I get the sinking feeling in my gut that if he doesn't pull it together this season it will be his last with us.
losangeleskings,3cjmml,swisschez,4,Wed Jul 8 14:53:27 2015 UTC,Yeahhhhh...Brown has to step up to the plate big time this year
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Pen2Paper,2,Wed Jul 8 15:51:32 2015 UTC,That's a cool graph. Pretty obvious to see his point production just doesn't fit the bill.
losangeleskings,3cjmml,swisschez,2,Wed Jul 8 15:52:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his possession stats are still pretty solid but holy hell has his point production nose dived (reference the lower chart)  Edit for more fun facts:   Brown had lowest SH% @ 5.80% among all forwards except Clifford @ 5.10% and Shore @ 3.00% Brown had third highest amount of Shots @ 189 among all forwards, trailing only Carter (218) and Toffoli (200)"
losangeleskings,3cjmml,sonician,2,Wed Jul 8 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"The third-highest shot total stands out to me as this past season being a bit of an anomaly for Brownie.   Just some bad puck luck, combined with an exhaustive schedule. I expect a big season from him this upcoming year."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,LAKBurner,2,Wed Jul 8 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Can't add anything to what you said, but will say I'm hopeful. If anyone can do it, he can."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Blutroyale-_-,3,Wed Jul 8 17:42:17 2015 UTC,polite and accurate without too much negativity; here's to wishing for a better season to come from all players.
losangeleskings,3cjmml,HgFrLr,-7,Wed Jul 8 14:43:26 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call him the greatest C in the pacific by any means. Hard to be a role model (for example) pulling up those stats...
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Nicklasav,7,Wed Jul 8 16:53:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's a better C than Getzlaf, Giordano, whoever the Oilers' C is, Doan, the San Jose Sharks, and Sedin."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,HgFrLr,-7,Wed Jul 8 17:30:03 2015 UTC,I disagree. I really like the Kings (a little less now because Lucic) however another player on the team I dislike is Dustin Brown. And in my opinion the better captains in the pacific are; gio and getzlaf. They get the team pumped up while also pulling up great stats.
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Pen2Paper,8,Wed Jul 8 17:37:43 2015 UTC,You dislike him so you don't consider him a great captain? Whereas Gio is still the hot new thing and Getzlaf continues to be a no-show in his team's biggest games.
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Pen2Paper,6,Wed Jul 8 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Getz has turned into a whiny bitch. I used to respect the guy, but now all he does is cry about anything and everything on top of not showing up to big games."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,HgFrLr,2,Wed Jul 8 19:06:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the dude has always been a sniveler and cry-baby. That's another reason I love Brownie, always a level head."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Pen2Paper,0,Wed Jul 8 19:18:27 2015 UTC,"In 16 games during the post season Getzlaf got 20 points. So I have 0 idea what you're talking about. Gio isn't a ""hot new thing"" he's always been pretty good. And if we're solely talking about points, then let's look at Browns..."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,HgFrLr,3,Wed Jul 8 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"You're the only one talking about points. Just a head's up this isn't the place to be defensive about Getzlaf's captaincy. He's never lead the playoffs in points like Brown has (2012) and he's never captained his team to a Cup. We all know Getzlaf's a better player, he's MVP calibre. But this thread is about #23, Dustin Brown, what he brings to the Kings, and what to expect this year."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,lordjedediah,2,Wed Jul 8 20:21:28 2015 UTC,"I realize I talked about points. But then you said getzlaf doesn't show up during the playoffs for some reason. I see that this thread is about brown- however I was discussing how I don't believe he is the best captain in the pacific division. I think he's really overrated. This is a discussion thread, it doesn't need to be a circle jerk, you don't have to like every player on a team."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,TheEw0kGamer,5,Wed Jul 8 20:26:24 2015 UTC,Getlzlaf chokes as hard as the entire San Jose franchise in games that matter.
losangeleskings,3cjmml,HgFrLr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:43:21 2015 UTC,"He is specifically talking about their last game(s) in the playoffs, the game 7's, after a 3-2 lead in the series, for the last three years. He shits the bed every time in the game(s) that matter the most. But I agree with you, discuss away on your opinions--this is what the thread is for."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Zanchbot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:13:34 2015 UTC,You don't like them because they got one player? Alright then. But you're also playing a little homer by putting Giordano in there.
losangeleskings,3cjmml,LOUD__NOISES,0,Wed Jul 8 23:39:27 2015 UTC,"""I really like the Kings"" ""So you dislike the Kings because of one little player?""   No remember my first sentence? I like the Kings, however I don't like all the players on the team."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,akat16,8,Thu Jul 9 05:54:30 2015 UTC,"Last season it was Richards who needed to step up his game (he didn't, but that's another story), this season it's gotta be Brown. He's making too much money now to be putting up such meager offensive numbers. He's a great leader for this team, I don't think anyone can deny that, but it'd be nice if his numbers were closer to what they were before 2012."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,akat16,6,Wed Jul 8 15:27:48 2015 UTC,"Out of everyone on the Kings, I think a successful year from Dustin Brown next year is most important. If our 3rd line can be productive we will be good to go.  Hopefully with Stoll gone at center, he can increase production with Shore.  15-20 goals 20 assists I think would be a really good goal for Brown."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,nenright,4,Wed Jul 8 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"I am very curious to see where Sutter puts him this coming year. With the addition of Lucic, he gets bumped off the 1st line and I don't think they want to break up the 70's line now that they are all healthy, so that puts him on the 3rd line. Hopefully that can take some pressure off of him and allow him to be a bottom 6 scoring threat. I am curious as to who else would be on that 3rd line with him."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,krucz36,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:38:56 2015 UTC,Probably Shore and The Colonel.
losangeleskings,3cjmml,BlueApple10,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:54:11 2015 UTC,"I am hoping it will be Weal at center and Lewis and Brown on the wings, but I think the more likely scenario would be Lewis centering Brown and King"
losangeleskings,3cjmml,crass_bonanza,2,Wed Jul 8 16:07:26 2015 UTC,i see sutter putting shore at 3C and lewis at 4C. it seems like weal will probably be playing on the wing. early on i think it will be: king-shore-brown clifford-lewis-weal/nolan
losangeleskings,3cjmml,paranoidpikachu,5,Thu Jul 9 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"I expect a turnaround season for Cap. I'm calling 60+ pts on 20 goals, and a revival of the heavy hitting we all know and love. If he winds up on the third line he'll have a lot of shots at a screened goalie on rebounds too. Fingers crossed but he could crash and burn too. I'm pulling for you Brown!"
losangeleskings,3cjmml,crass_bonanza,3,Wed Jul 8 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"If he ends up staying on the third line, I don't see a 60+ season. I could easily see a 50 point season though, which would be a great season while playing on the third line."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,nenright,3,Thu Jul 9 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that we may see a rejuvenated Brownie next season.  I expect around 40 points as he will most likely be on the third line, which should be much more offensive this year, along with being on the second PP unit.  If we get his top of the league physicality back and Brownie can pop 20 from the bottom 6 I think this team will be in a very good position next season."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,herpaderpder,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:54:16 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that we may see a rejuvenated Brownie next season.   Pretty much how I feel about Brownie as well. I think Lucic will play a big part on how Brown acts this upcoming season and I just have a gut feeling he'll step up his game.
losangeleskings,3cjmml,LAKingBob,3,Wed Jul 8 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"It should be fun, the addition of Looch will give us toughness on 3 lines, then we get to roll out Carter and his kids to clean up."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Omnivirus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:39:04 2015 UTC,"if we can get good 3rd line scoring from brown and shore and whoever else is on that line, it will be a matchup nightmare for other teams"
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Anewman1188,3,Thu Jul 9 00:52:46 2015 UTC,"the amount of hustle in brown's game this last year was awesome. his level of production was unfortunate because you could see he really is in the best shape he's been, skating faster and wants to produce but he's snakebitten.   With Lucic on the team he doesn't have to worry about being on the first line and can get comfortable in the 3rd line role where hopefully he finds his shot again.  king - lewis - brown is a pretty damn solid 3rd line.   I personally think Lucic will drive brown to fight harder for his job and the worst case scenario is if he's dealt to keep Lucic around it's only going to end up fetching a better return.  favorite brown moments are the flip pass from kopitar goal, when he knocked henrik sedin into next week, and the triple deke breakaway in the final"
losangeleskings,3cjmml,lordjedediah,3,Wed Jul 8 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"Oh god, his cap hit is almost 6 mil a year..  Even with all the odds against him (age, limited talent, big cap hit), I have faith.  He seems really motivated to improve this summer (there's videos of him training and apparently he's been working with Daryl Evans).  And there's a reason why he's considered to be one of the best captains in the Pacific if not the league.  The man lead the Kings to their first two SCs in the org's 45+ years of existence, and was one of the alternate caps for the 2014 Olympics.  I wish I could participate in these threads the past few days but I have been working at my internship :("
losangeleskings,3cjmml,Anewman1188,2,Thu Jul 9 07:50:15 2015 UTC,"This is the last year I'll accept ""works hard, hits a lot"" as the main reasons why I like Brown. With his cap hit he HAS to bring 40 points minimum to the table, plus those other intangibles. Otherwise, he needs to be traded for 20 cents on the dollar and we need to think about the future."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,krucz36,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:02:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and thankfully he seems to realize this. I really hope he has a comeback."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,thegetawayplan9,3,Sun Jul 12 20:26:40 2015 UTC,"Extend Kopi, give him the ""C"", trade Brownie, free up cap space. Then with all that money saved from Voynov's termination, Brownie's money and Ricard's termination or buyout, sign a solid D and save for when the kiddos need extensions. I know he's our Captain and I am so thankful for what he has done but he is not going to have that turn around, 40-60 points on the 3rd line? He will have 30 points again. Yet, he has trade value, I know we all love him, but we cannot make the same mistakes we did with Richards. We are handcuffing ourselves. It's a shit reality but it's the most likely."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,xray606,10,Wed Jul 8 16:22:23 2015 UTC,"Please provide a list of solid D that the Kings can sign.  Please tell me how the Kings players will react to the immediate culture change from management and locker room leadership.   Please tell me which teams want a 30 pt, 3rd liner with a cap hit of almost $6 million."
losangeleskings,3cjmml,xray606,2,Wed Jul 8 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"Right now Franson and Oduya are the only options I would consider. But we all know that DL could work a trade, imagine freeing up that space and acquiring someone like Dougie Hamilton like Calgary did.  This is the biggest problem. You may be right that the repercussions from the culture change could outweigh any positives.  Like many of us, we think he can still turn it around. He shows that he still has stuff left in the tank every once in awhile but I think that is all he has. Teams with cap space who are looking to make that push next year and could benefit from a guy who has experience as a leader and champion and also shows he can contribute, teams like Buffalo, Ottawa and Florida, maybe even Edmonton (I know it's same division).    I understand loyalty and the culture and the intangibles he provides but we were all saying the same thing about Richards. I hope and would guess Brownie would never get in anything remotely close to the off ice issues as Richards but I think his play could eventually spiral to comparability.   I'm not trying to play devil's advocate but I think if a situation arose where it made sense it should be considered."

losangeleskings,3cfr57,CrispyLardon,12,Tue Jul 7 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Kings need Andreoff, Clifford and Nolan all on the roster especially now that Lucic is far and away the best fighter on the team.   To me he's a trade deadline throw in. I'd much rather see some of the smaller, skilled guys get inserted into our lineup. I know Brian O'Neil and Jordan Weal are undersized compared to the rest of the Kings but I think the Kings could use a couple players like that. Not everyone needs to be a checking monster."
losangeleskings,3cfr57,lordjedediah,6,Tue Jul 7 16:28:48 2015 UTC,I'd much rather see Brian O'Neill on the roster rather than Andreoff.

losangeleskings,3cfr57,npc23,2,Tue Jul 7 17:48:16 2015 UTC,I like him. He needs more playing time and I see him as a capable 4th line center...
losangeleskings,3cfr57,thegetawayplan9,2,Tue Jul 7 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"I think he needs more consistent minutes to see how he can do. He went pointless in his first 14 games, and then picked up three points (including two goals) in the last four games he played. I don't think that's a coincidence. I think third-liner who can chip in with secondary scoring is probably his ceiling, but I'd rather develop guys to their ceiling and have more tradeable assets than to let them languish.  I do have a couple of areas of concern. Sutter seems to dislike him. It seems like there's a suggestion he doesn't practice as hard as he should when he knows he's not getting into the line-up of that night's game. Finally, him trying to stuff as many peeps (or whatever they were) into his mouth as possible on ""Road to the Stadium Series"" to impress the guys is not a good look on him. From a conditioning/nutrition standpoint it's terrible, of course. But it's also terrible from a future locker room leader aspect that he's seeking approval through weird stunts. There was a Mayor's Manor interview with Toffoli where he said “Andy is his whipping boy. He tests them all out on Andy to see what nicknames are good. Probably because Andy gets a little mad sometimes.  Not mad, just a little bitter.” regarding Linden Vey giving out nickames. Something about him stuffing those crackers or whatever in his mouth just gave me that same vibe that reading that quote did."

I don't think we'll hear what it is until after Voynov's jail time.   Mike Richards is a tricker situation. The NHLPA has only made one statement.    ""We are in the process of reviewing the facts and circumstances of this matter and will discuss the situation with the player in order to determine the appropriate course of action.""

losangeleskings,3ccf85,inalasahl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:54:36 2015 UTC,"The league really can't do anything about Voynov until after he has served time in jail and the immigration court has had their say.   If the immigration court order him deported, they don't have to fight the PA about terminating his contract.  If immigration says he can stay, then re ball will be in the leagues court (puck on their ice?).  Then they have to decide what to do with him.  If they clear him to play, then the Kings will have to reinstate him, unless they invoke the clause that allowed them to suspend him for his injury (which was apparently doing something his contract says is a no-no). In this case they release him for material breach just like Mike.   As for Mike, I have to think that this is the end of a series of attempts to get his ass in line about drugs.  This is pure speculation, but given that the PA hasn't already filed a grievance I have begun to believe that it's a loser.  If and its a huge IF, mike has already been through league treatment or refused to go...then the border incident happened.   That sounds like material breach.

He first has to serve some jail time and heal from the achilles injury which the Kings used to suspend him. I imagine the Kings will punt to the NHL. The NHL will determine that a guy who went to jail for beating his wife isn't worth the negative publicity, toss his contract into the shredder, shake his hand and wish him a long and prosperous career in the KHL. Richards can't do anything until the RCMP conclude their investigation."
losangeleskings,3ccf85,LAKBurner,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"If the NHL thought Voynov wasn't worth the negative PR why wouldn't they have already banned him? It would make them look better taking a stance that strong, that ""early"". It's not like any of the facts are going to change, he plead no contest and he's going to jail. The only thing that could happen differently is the immigration court could deport him, but that's very unlikely. Voynov will be back in the league and on the Kings likely by the start of the season if he's healthy enough to play."

He's mostly known for beating his wife as far the public is concerned. Times have changed, pro sports are terrified of being seen as sympathetic to men that hit women. Look at the NFL and even Florida State the other day. It'll happen, but not until he's done his time, been medically cleared and asked to have the suspension lifted."

Ray Mc Donadl, Ray Rice, Kurt Busch, Warren Sapp, Greg Hardy... The accused get suspended, those that do time are getting cut loose. Bettman and the NHL have too much at stake to care if one of 1,500 gets a shot at redemption or deserves a second chance. The SPC gives them an out and Bettman is the final arbitrator. Slava's contract is nothing compared to one sponsor pulling their money. If you were Gary Bettman and you were praised for suspending him immediately are you going to hesitate to cut him loose? When league revenues are rising, you're getting $500,000,000 for a new franchise, getting rid of Slava is easy and cheap."

You could say the Carter won't be as much of a finisher with Tanner and Tyler to spread love to, so he'll get more point but not as many goals, though I do see him and even Toffoli getting at least 30 this year. Gabby I can see anywhere from 27-32 since Kopi will presumably take more shots and just play better this year.   Lucic will benefit from being on a line with them, since the opposing team will want to take away more space from them rather than Lucic, he'll get a load of points that way, but I can't see him scoring 30.

DL brought in a guy that makes LA even more of a physical force. Lucic has contributed to a cup run and a bitter loss to Chicago in the SCF. I think Lucic will be frothing at the mouth if we face the Hawks in the playoffs next year. That's what we need, somebody that wants revenge.   Best case scenario: Lucic pots 25 goals, brings his lunchpail to work each shift, blasts a few suckers through the glass and Kings win the cup again. Likely scenario: Lucic scores 18-20 goals and Kings get a top 4 seed in the playoffs. Worst case scenario: Lucic gives Toffoli mono again and breaks Pearsons leg while horsing around in the locker room and the Kings still finish ahead of the Sharks in the standings.   *unless the cap skyrockets to $80-90 million in 2016-17 I don't see a way to re-sign Lucic. Kopitar is about to get (deservedly) paid and other NHL teams haven't been too keen on taking our bad contracts. Unless an expansion team claims Dustin Brown I just don't see us having the cap space to keep Looch."
losangeleskings,3cbcea,PissOnEddieShore,9,Mon Jul 6 17:04:48 2015 UTC,... and the Kings still finish ahead of the Sharks in the standings.   I'm good with that.
losangeleskings,3cbcea,avioneta,4,Mon Jul 6 20:25:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this.  Bonus for us is it is a contract year for Lucic, so he'll be extra motivated to win so he can pocket some extra $$$ on his next contract, which I agree will be with another team.  Three dollar signs worth even.  We win another cup, its worth the prospect/pick even with him gone right away.  We have a good core and we should trade for success now while we are within a piece or two of winning."
losangeleskings,3cbcea,alljake,2,Tue Jul 7 00:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yup. We forget how precious it is to be in position to contend for a cup. The time to strike is NOW. LA and Chicago are going to keep their core players (Kopitar, Doughty, Quick vs Toews, Kane, Keith) with both teams filling the bottom of the roster with cheap vets and prospects. The core remains intact while ancillary pieces come and go. This can easily go on for 3-5 more years. Yes, we'll lose guys like Williams (one of my favorites) but DL will find somebody to fill the spot. We got Lucic right now which is kind of like renting a kickass car while on vacation. No, we aren't going to keep him but we can enjoy the ride until we let him go."
losangeleskings,3cbcea,PissOnEddieShore,5,Tue Jul 7 02:58:32 2015 UTC,I hope to the leftover ribs I am about to demolish that we re-sign him.
losangeleskings,3cbcea,CrispyLardon,2,Mon Jul 6 16:32:52 2015 UTC,With what money? The trade only works because of salary retention.   The Kings don't have a lot of money leaving next season. Assuming Kopitar is extended the Kings have...  UFA's Lewis Lucic McBain Enroth  RFA's McNabb  That's it. The Kings are going to be operating at the same (likely higher) cap hit next season and I don't think Lucic is going to be resigning at a 3.25.
losangeleskings,3cbcea,lordjedediah,3,Mon Jul 6 17:06:18 2015 UTC,"If Richards stays gone there could be room for him. As it stands now with no Richards and Voynov, the Kings have 19 players signed with 7.5m in cap space. The remaining 4 players probably come in on sub-1m contracts (Shore, Andreoff, and 2 AHL dmen). That leaves you with around 3.5m in cap space this year. Assuming the cap goes up next year by a couple million, you probably have 5.5+m next year to sign Lucic, Kopitar and Lewis.   Kopitar at 10m, 3.2m raise   Lucic at 6m, 2.75 raise   Lewis either stays around 1.5 or goes.  That's 5.95m in raises for what looks to be around 3.5m (current cap space) + Raised cap ceiling. It's not a slam dunk, but I think it's workable. I think if Lucic fits well he can and will be retained."
losangeleskings,3cbcea,parineum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"Your scenario assumes voynov isn't coming back. In all likelihood, he will be on the team next year(DL wants him back, he probably won't be deported so depends if Bettman lets him back in the NHL). Lets assume he is back to take the worst case scenario cap wise. So we would have 57.159 million in cap space, assuming Weal, shore, andreoff, and Berube signed for 800K each and voynov is on the roster. We would need to sign Kopitar, mcnabb, forbort, Lewis. So let's assume kopi goes for 10. Now it's 67 million. We'll assume, as you said, that the cap rises by 2 million. So we have approximately 6.3 million to sign Lewis, forbort, mcnabb, possibly/probably McBain. At least a million for mcNabb. Let's go 1.25, as that seems fair. Now we have 5M. Sign forbort for a million since he's already making 800K and would probably want a raise. Now we have 4 million. Maybe if we let Lewis go, we could keep lucic at about that price. But also don't forget that we can't offer him anything more than about a year because we'll also need room for toffoli's and pearson's new contracts down the road. Basically, unless we trade voynov or he's not allowed in the NHL, we can't re-sign him."
losangeleskings,3cbcea,nenright,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:08:57 2015 UTC,I actually do think Voynov will be back but I think Martinez moves if he is.  That's why I am confident assuming that cap space is usable.

losangeleskings,3ccpoz,BadAtThisKindOfThing,2,Mon Jul 6 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"So theres RFA's (restricted free agent) and teams can either make deals with them separately (toffoli or pearson). This is done if they are getting bigger deals. If they aren't getting a big increase the team has to either let them walk or give them a qualifying offer. Depending on their past salary a qualifying offer is between 100-110% of their last salary. When a qualifying offer is issued it keeps them as RFA's and the player can sign that offer as a one year deal, he can negotiate offer sheets with other teams (whole other thing but almost never used and won't be used on any of our RFA's that aren't signed. they just aren't good enough), or he can file for arbitration.   Arbitration takes this to a arbitrator who will decide the salary for next year. Both the player and the team submit what they think is a fair amount. The arbitrator looks at this decides what the players salary should be. The team can either accept or decline this. Accepting gives the player a 1 year deal at this amount, declining makes them a unrestricted free agent.  Even when a player elects for salary arbitration (like King did last year) often times its settled before gets to the arbitrator. But this is all standard operating procedure and nothing to worry about here. Only Toffoli, Pearson and maybe Jones were at risk of being offer sheeted. The rest will sign with modest increases."
losangeleskings,3ccpoz,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:52:44 2015 UTC,"I believe the Kings went to arbitration with Dwight king last year, though I may be mistaken. Yeah, it doesn't seem that shocking to me to see 20ish go to arbitration. That's only one player per team per year. You figure you have 21 guys on your roster (12 forwards 6 defense 2 goalies and an extra) for each team so you've got 630 players in the NHL at any time at least. 23 players is only 3.6% of NHL players."

losangeleskings,3ccpoz,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:00:32 2015 UTC,"If you understand what arbitration it, is isn't actually that weird to imagine teams/players going to it. Free agents can walk they can get more money, years or just into a different city if they can't agree with their team in everything, restricted agents cannot.  They are basically stuck in the same contract with the same team with free options. If the team wants to low ball them they can't just go to a new team, so they file for arbitration who will look at both sides and generally help players and teams find reasonable ground. Plenty of teams low-ball their RFA, you don't want to pay more than you have to for someone who can't leave.  Last season Dwight King filed for arbitration, but they settled before hand."
losangeleskings,3ccpoz,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:29:32 2015 UTC,"I just imagine other arbitration scenarios and I assume they're pretty hostile, like all negotiations and reasoning has been exhausted. If things are that bad, I can't imagine either side being satisfied with the outcome. And with Lombardi's family culture in the Kings locker room, it seems like arbitration just wouldn't sit well.     Also, it hadn't occurred to me that it would only apply to restricted free agents, which makes sense. Thanks!"

losangeleskings,3c818b,EinsamWulf,2,Sun Jul 5 20:44:55 2015 UTC,What I'm worried about is his free agency next year.  would the Kings be able to meet what he's looking for in terms of salary? (assuming he does well this upcoming season and everyone wants him back)
losangeleskings,3c818b,LAKingBob,3,Sun Jul 5 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"If it comes down to him and Kopi I think we all know that DL will keep Kopi and let Lucic go.

losangeleskings,3c818b,EinsamWulf,6,Sun Jul 5 21:47:14 2015 UTC,I think we are more likely to see Brown depart than any of those guys.

First two were kind of impulse buys [I have their Flyers' jerseys too], don't really regret it despite everything that happened with Richards.

When you gaze long term, Kopitar and Doughty are arguably our biggest players and Toffoli and Pearson have some huge upside and a large cieling. We still have to do the Kopitar deal then the following year we have Toffoli and Pearson (RFAs but I wouldn't be surprised to see them make some money). And Doughty would then be 2 seasons after that. I just don't see us really being able to invest in Lucic without moving pieces. Not to mention the American hero next season as well"

Since I already know Lucic was a decent [arguably good/very good perhaps] player with the Bruins I don't exactly need to be reminded of that. My concern is our locker room,  and generally whether or not he will fit into our system and mesh well with out guys. More so, I'd like him not to threaten murder and other such things if we get him to a handshake line.

losangeleskings,3c2o9m,CaptainTicklebeard,5,Sat Jul 4 15:49:59 2015 UTC,I have a game worn 2014 playoff jersey I'll sell for the right price.
losangeleskings,3c2o9m,MondoHawkins,2,Sat Jul 4 18:10:09 2015 UTC,"Ugh, that's heart breaking."
losangeleskings,3c2o9m,MagicArc,2,Thu Jul 9 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Thought I was getting myself a nice piece of Kings SC memorabilia that I'd be able to cherish throughout the years. So much for that.  Even more heartbreaking is that I also have a Stoll game worn jersey from 2013. I sure know how to pick them.   At least, I never bought a Richards game worn."
losangeleskings,3c2o9m,MondoHawkins,2,Thu Jul 9 17:13:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly i'd rather have the Stoll one.  At least he just made a stupid decision of taking drugs to a public pool, having a party is a lot better than beating your girlfriend.  I'd actually be okay with the Richards one, lots of guys have drug/performance issues.  But yeah, that's some horrible luck."
losangeleskings,3c2o9m,MagicArc,2,Thu Jul 9 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"The Stoll jersey feels less tainted for sure. Not that I plan to sell it, but I figure it's lost much less value than the Voynov jersey did."
losangeleskings,3c2o9m,MondoHawkins,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:30:56 2015 UTC,True.  What made you decide to go with Stoll in the first place?  Availability? Price?
losangeleskings,3c2o9m,MagicArc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"Price mainly. It was among the cheapest I could buy at the time. I got it autographed by him at the 2013 Meet The Players party too.   I was all set to get the Voynov jersey signed at the 2014 Meet The Players party, but he was suspended right before they held it.  Edit: Here's pics of my Stoll jersey."
losangeleskings,3c2o9m,MondoHawkins,14,Thu Jul 9 18:17:41 2015 UTC,Probably the cup
losangeleskings,3c15iy,skylanderscodes,54,Fri Jul 3 20:29:38 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  /r/hockey mod here. I removed the thread in question because it was needlessly sensationalistic.   I need your help though, there is a report feature on reddit and if you think a post is out of line, I need you to consider using it before getting worked up. There was only one report for that thread and it wasn't very visible to the team, which means that the thread stayed up for over an hour before someone reviewed it. It literally takes 2 seconds and I promise a real human mod reviews every reported post and comment.  Peace!"
losangeleskings,3c15iy,elrizzy,13,Fri Jul 3 21:22:39 2015 UTC,Never noticed there was a report feature. I guess its good to know if/when more of these come in the future

losangeleskings,3c15iy,ShitPostPolice,14,Sat Jul 4 02:03:51 2015 UTC,"I think when people hear things like domestic violence, rape, murder, etc, people will let their emotions make their decisions.  It's understandable, maybe they're trying to put themselves or their loved ones in the victim's shoes but it's not helpful when they're not looking at the facts/evidence.  They'll hear about the speculations, not actually see any proof and immediately decide the suspect is guilty.    Even worse is when they ignore everyone that disagrees with them and generalizes an entire fanbase.."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,LAKingBob,14,Fri Jul 3 21:03:15 2015 UTC,"A ducks fan tried to use one of your comments as an example of supporting domestic violence. Got called out real quick, such a joke."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,BW4LL,9,Fri Jul 3 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"ooo ooo ooo, I wanna see!  Edit: Found it!  The ""guise of asking questions""..  Interesting, I feel like the person making the accusations should provide the burden of proof not the person defending themselves.  It's like if I said ""there's a single plastic spoon that rotates between sun and the earth twice a year"", I think I should be the one providing evidence not the people disagreeing with me."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,LAKingBob,-26,Fri Jul 3 21:22:21 2015 UTC,"He fucking took responsibility for his actions.   What the hell more evidence do you need.   Anyway, have fun cheering for a scumbag."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,IFightClouds,14,Fri Jul 3 22:02:34 2015 UTC,Remember when you had Heatley?
losangeleskings,3c15iy,lordjedediah,-19,Fri Jul 3 22:23:07 2015 UTC,Sure do.   Heatley never intended to hurt anyone as far as I'm aware.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,IFightClouds,8,Fri Jul 3 22:29:56 2015 UTC,"Voynov didn't kill someone with his irresponsibility. DV isn't cool any way shape or form, and I no way am I trying to justify Voynovs actions. If I had it my way, every pro athlete that committed DV WOULD BE BANNED FROM ALL COMPETITION FOR LIFE. Wrote that in caps so you can't use it as ammo and everyone will see it.   But you're ok with a person who took someone's life. Someone who thought that driving wrecklessly and taking people's loved one is ok and that he should be allowed back into the NHL?!? The minimal crime in that incident should have been at least manslaughter. So there. Keep supporting a life taker. Think about it. Get your shit sorted mate."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,clambam11,2,Sat Jul 4 00:17:20 2015 UTC,I doubt Voynov went into the situation intending to hurt his wife. Things escalated from an arguement and he made a poor choice. That's what Heatley and Voynov share in common. Poor choices.   Heatley chose to drive between 55-82 in a 35 mph zone. It's human to makes bad choices. If Voynov learns from this and gets the proper help I don't mind giving him another chance.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,tyroniousurf,-20,Fri Jul 3 23:00:10 2015 UTC,Lol.   This is exactly the kind of ridiculous justification for a wife beater I'm talking about.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,IFightClouds,11,Fri Jul 3 23:13:02 2015 UTC,Where am I justifying it? What Voynov did is fucked up and nowhere in that comment did I try to defend him. Im saying to error is human.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,tyroniousurf,-21,Fri Jul 3 23:16:55 2015 UTC,"Your compared a guy beating the fuck out of his wife to a guy that dove a little too fast and got in an accident.   Ridiculous.   Anyway, this will be my last comment here.  Have fun cheering for a wife beater."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,IFightClouds,5,Fri Jul 3 23:19:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, he plead no contest. Not sure that's taking responsibility.   And I'd like him off the team.   Why are you here again? Nothing better to do than troll our sub for some feelings of moral superiority ?"
losangeleskings,3c15iy,nickmakhno,-14,Fri Jul 3 22:49:05 2015 UTC,No contest is pleading guilty for all intents and purposes.   And I'm here because suspicious voting patterns on one of my comments led me to believe that it was linked to. And I was right.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,IFightClouds,7,Fri Jul 3 23:09:49 2015 UTC,"Not really, it's a plea deal. It's more of compromise between the prosecution and defense than pleading guilty.  Whatever you say man. Even so, why come in here and bitch about it? Report and move on instead of being a cock. We get it, you don't like the Kings. We don't care."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,nickmakhno,2,Fri Jul 3 23:51:25 2015 UTC,Guess you're not as dumb as we all thought
losangeleskings,3c15iy,BagelzAllDay,13,Sat Jul 4 00:13:58 2015 UTC,"I don't see anyone justifying anything Voynov did. What he did was terrible and inexcusable. Nobody is pro-domestic violence on this or any sub that I've seen.  He's also accepting responsibility and facing his punishment head-on. Receiving a significant punishment from the state for a misdemeanor. I'd just like to see some semblance of reason in regard to Slava's punishment from the NHL. Something consistent with past punishments.   Heatley killed a guy. MacTavish killed a woman. Lots of alleged wife beaters, even high profile guys like Roy, Potvin, Zubov and Hull. So it's ridiculous that fans of these other teams are calling out Kings fans for being soft on domestic violence.  Let's face it. Our heroes aren't always great humans. The NHL is full of assholes, at least Voynov is facing the music for being an asshole."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,seabass4507,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:57:13 2015 UTC,"Even more recently Varlamov. There was a fan with Avs flair saying ""I wouldn't want a wife beater in our locker room"". The irony was palpable."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,dalbtraps,21,Sat Jul 4 06:24:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised. Whatever the circlejerk is at /r/hockey , everyone always follows. Right now it's unpopular to be a kings fan. Whatever. They suck"
losangeleskings,3c15iy,jbizzzzle,7,Fri Jul 3 21:01:09 2015 UTC,lol holy shit. And I was mad yesterday.   Oh well
losangeleskings,3c15iy,RubeusShagrid,7,Fri Jul 3 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"Came here specifically to see if this guy was full of shit or not.  Glad to see he's a shitstain who was indeed, being a total bag of dicks."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,ColoradoHughes,3,Fri Jul 3 23:03:46 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for giving us a chance and taking a look yourself before judging all of us here at /r/losangeleskings!  I know our situation isn't exactly the best but we're good folk!    Unless you're a sharks fan.  jk notjk
losangeleskings,3c15iy,LAKingBob,3,Sat Jul 4 01:27:13 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Bruins fan. don't hurt me  Between the Bruins and Pats, we understand unjustified bullshit hatred in Boston."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,ColoradoHughes,3,Sat Jul 4 01:32:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have nothing against the Bruins.  Maybe a little towards Marchand but that's because he's good at what he does:  pesting and scoring.    Now that Lucic is with the Kings, how is he as a player?  I never watched Bruin games so the only highlights I've seen of Lucic are clips showing his bad side."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,LAKingBob,2,Sat Jul 4 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he's been underwhelming the past few seasons, but started returning to form when he was Papa Bear with Spooner and Pastrnak.  I think he'll fit in well with the Kings system, and in a contract year with something to prove on a new team, he'll come out as the power forward we all know he can be.  Overall, I'm gonna miss train #17.  The trick will likely be keeping him motivated after he gets a new contract."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,ColoradoHughes,2,Sat Jul 4 01:47:21 2015 UTC,We empathize with bruins fans. You guys were the number one target before us and are still a pretty close second.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,GaboKopiBrown,12,Sat Jul 4 03:19:53 2015 UTC,Seriously that was a very low move imo. Have it out here with us if you disagree but don't run to /r/hockey to try and feel morally superior.  I said my piece in that thread but honestly what a joke.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,BW4LL,4,Fri Jul 3 20:39:30 2015 UTC,"I replied to a level headed Habs fan's comment before it got shut down. At least one non Kings supporter called bullshit.

losangeleskings,3c15iy,dallenhill,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:56:37 2015 UTC,There were actually quite a few people in that thread that were sticking up for us and dove into our sub to investigate for themselves. There will always be sheeple on reddit. There's nothing you can do about it.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,clambam11,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:19:31 2015 UTC,I was genuinely happy to see people actually going into our sub and finding out themselves if the accusations were true or not.  It was definitely a nice break from the blind masses that'll believe any anti-Kings messages
losangeleskings,3c15iy,LAKingBob,9,Sat Jul 4 01:29:31 2015 UTC,That sub is the worst place on the Internet    The Kings hate there is just ridiculous
losangeleskings,3c15iy,Sniffman,14,Fri Jul 3 20:30:45 2015 UTC,I don't get it. The guy doesn't post any examples and everyone just goes along with it.  I hardly see any posts that are trying to exonerate Slava or his behavior on here. And even if there are people wanting him to come back are we not allowed to express our opinion? I don't get why /r/hockey hates the Kings so much. Sometimes its just not worth to go there.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,loginlogan,7,Fri Jul 3 20:39:03 2015 UTC,Right. We've had discussions on what the Kings should do and what not but I haven't seen many if any at all try and pin it on his ethnicity or what have you.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,BW4LL,4,Fri Jul 3 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"I just try to avoid the comment sections. Its a good place to get your hockey news, but just dont read the comments"
losangeleskings,3c15iy,Sniffman,3,Fri Jul 3 20:41:35 2015 UTC,"Anything even vaguely anti-Kings or Kings fans is going to receive a lot of karma in /r/hockey. It sucks, but that's the way it is. This guy didn't need to invite even more of that negative attention. If he seriously believes an ""overwhelming majority"" of us support Voynov and wants to leave this sub forever because of it, then I hope he does because he's fucking delusional.  EDIT: I should add that the OP of that thread is a Kings fan (and a pretty active one on this sub), though I assume it's probably in poor taste/against the rules to post his username."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,Zanchbot,2,Fri Jul 3 23:15:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely don't want the OP of that thread to leave as I think he's one of the more reputable posters on here but if this is what he wants to do then c'est la vie.    That said, I wonder if he will realize that all of last night was a just big misunderstanding/miscommunication."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,LAKingBob,3,Sat Jul 4 01:32:47 2015 UTC,"Most of the comments I read on that thread were questioning him, not ""lapping it up"". There are a lot of anti-Kings people over there, but most of them seemed to call bullshit on that guy."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,hopesfail,2,Sat Jul 4 04:36:06 2015 UTC,"No, I was there when it was 20 minutes new and I can verify what people here are saying is true.    In the beginning most of the comments were of posters agreeing with OP and how disgusting our ""acceptance of domestic violence was"".  It wasn't until several /r/lak posters began to defend our sub and told people to take a look before making their judgments when people finally did that.  What you're currently seeing is the aftermath of everything."
losangeleskings,3c15iy,LAKingBob,2,Sat Jul 4 20:09:38 2015 UTC,He deleted his account.

losangeleskings,3c15iy,humbuckermudgeon,2,Sat Jul 4 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit sad and disappointed.  We just lost one of our more involved and reputable posters here on /r/losangeleskings.  He misunderstood the conversations in the subreddit last night, aired out his frustrations on /r/hockey, only to have his name and reputation tarnished within hours.    It wasn't just Kings fans clearing the air, other fanbases actually came to our sub and called him out when they couldn't find any proof of what he was claiming.  And instead of being a bigger person and apologizing, he decides to disappear and probably start lurking or create a new account.  Now everyone in this sub loses, he 's not going to participate in our threads and people won't get to see his contributions anymore.  Edit: Did he really delete his account?  I can see go to his profile and see his last post was a couple of hours ago."

losangeleskings,3c15iy,GaboKopiBrown,2,Sat Jul 4 03:21:15 2015 UTC,Not the reason I asked. I'm wondering who the involved and reputable poster is that we lost.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,humbuckermudgeon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:23:35 2015 UTC,The person is still there it's just when a thread is deleted it removes the username. I hope we all can move on from this and focus on next season.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,BW4LL,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:45:34 2015 UTC,Ditto.  It sucks to lose members but I'm sure we will be a bigger stronger community when the season starts again.
losangeleskings,3c15iy,LAKingBob,2,Sat Jul 4 20:58:33 2015 UTC,"Lol, you can imagine my surprise on returning home to see that my speculation on why they are so dysfunctional blew up to something way out of proportion and turned into me--and the whole sub--justifying his actions. When I even clearly say it is no excuse for what he did.  I guess speculating on the why, is the same as justifying it. Hooobboooyyyy. Edit: I am seeing that it was a Kings fan that totally misunderstood my reply to someone else? Who was it? And what did the post originally say? I am so confused; I missed all of this while being gone.  Sorry for causing all this drama. Edit #2: /u/LAKingBob you seem to know what's up, can you fill me in please?"

He's right you essentially use it as a mask.   I went to the FireFly Music Festival in Delaware not to long ago. For four days straight I was HAMMERED. The one day I was beyond gone I missed some bands I really wanted to see, was screaming in people faces, just being a dick. Everyone I know views me as the raging alcoholic and it sucks.   I tend to drink a lot to have fun, but I also do it to hide from my demons. Can only do it for so long though. I've since cut down dramatically on alcohol, started exercising and I'm actually able to save my money now.   Craft beer is a big hobby of mine, everything is good in moderation. Now I just need to quit smoking!"

I recently went eleven months without a drink.  Not because I had to, or was trying.  I just didn't feel like it and never gave it a second thought.

losangeleskings,3c0wor,Sniffman,3,Fri Jul 3 19:26:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not a lawyer and am not familiar with the legal repercussions other than Voynov plead no contest and will be in jail for 90 days. The NHL could suspend him or could complicate travel. The prosecutors keep bring up deportation, too. All of these make me think it's doubtful Voynov will play in the NHL again, but time will tell."
losangeleskings,3c0wor,Syben,6,Fri Jul 3 19:33:38 2015 UTC,He won't serve anywhere close to 90 days. With good behavior and prison overcrowding I'm guessing 30 tops. Also the NHL has already suspended him but I don't see them banning him.
losangeleskings,3c0wor,paulkardos,3,Fri Jul 3 19:37:02 2015 UTC,"You are correct.  Some people are saying he'll serve ""at least 90 days"" but that's not how it works.  No one serves the full sentence, at least on a misdemeanor.  I'd guess 2/3rd 's sentence (60 days) at the most."

losangeleskings,3c0wor,GaboKopiBrown,4,Sat Jul 4 23:16:47 2015 UTC,"Deportation is for unemployed day laborers, not nhl stars.  Ugly, but it's the truth."
losangeleskings,3c0wor,dalbtraps,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:18:25 2015 UTC,DL and most of the other staff must think that he'll be coming back otherwise they would have already made a move for a defenseman. The fact that they haven't suggests he is likely to come back and they will fill the gaps with Forbort/Schultz.
losangeleskings,3c0wor,paulkardos,2,Fri Jul 3 21:51:10 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Although I understand why people are hesitant to include Slava in any projected lineup, the fact is someone whose employment generates millions of taxable revenue dollars isn't going to be deported so easily.  We can argue the ethics behind business/politics/the legal system all day, but that's how the world works.  This doesn't mean I agree with how things work, but it's naive to think many questionable decisions made in life don't revolve around money.  I'll eat my hat (dry, no sauce) if he's not playing for the Kings regularly by the New Year."
losangeleskings,3c0wor,niomosy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:55:07 2015 UTC,Voynov's not in the clear yet.  There's still a potential for another hearing on whether or not he should be deported.  There's also the potential for the Kings to trade him.
losangeleskings,3c0wor,ToastedFireBomb,4,Fri Jul 3 22:12:44 2015 UTC,"I expect Voynov to be back in action towards the start of the year. He will really help us out on the blue, thankfully."
losangeleskings,3c0wor,LOUD__NOISES,3,Fri Jul 3 20:09:33 2015 UTC,"Whether we like it or not, Voynov will be back.   Although I'm not sure why we just signed McBain."

There is a culture of violence in Russia and it's not just husband on wife but wife on husband. I'm not saying that's the case with Voynov though, just expanding on how different our cultures are. Does that make Slava's actions okay? Fuck no. Does that mean he is the devil, no. Now, North America can't fix the issues in Russia and push for a cultural change with the way people handle conflict resolution but they can educate. I think more care and effort should be made to educate on the harm of domestic violence. I got a little off track but in reality there is a 90% chance we see Voynov in our colors next season."

losangeleskings,3c08id,Sniffman,5,Fri Jul 3 18:48:47 2015 UTC,ok luc is the only more important king
losangeleskings,3c08id,thegetawayplan9,5,Fri Jul 3 20:10:48 2015 UTC,Robitaille retired with more goals from the LW than anyone other player ever. I might put Kopitar at 3.
losangeleskings,3c08id,the_strat,8,Fri Jul 3 18:43:54 2015 UTC,I think he takes 9-9.5 and calls it a day.

losangeleskings,3c3xoa,krucz36,-5,Sat Jul 4 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"ehh, was a bit of an exaggeration, but it seems like the overwhelming majority of r/LAK wants him back"
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,CrispyLardon,7,Sat Jul 4 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"Knowing that realistically it might not be our choice to have him back, is not the same as wanting him back, or thinking he deserves to be back.  At this point I am pretty sure everyone is just trying to make the best out of a bad situation since it's out of our hands."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,thegetawayplan9,4,Sat Jul 4 17:37:41 2015 UTC,"Knowing that realistically it might not be our choice to have him back,   most people don't get that its not our choice. its the nhl. if they reinstate him and he's fit to play we have to play him or trade him. (trading will be hard). most people don't get that we can't just tell him to fuck off"
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,CrispyLardon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:14:23 2015 UTC,Exactly. And people also don't understand that the Richards situation is completely different. The NHL didn't take that situation out of our hands.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:37:06 2015 UTC,yep. they shouldn't be compared at all

losangeleskings,3c3xoa,BiohazardPixie,2,Sat Jul 4 18:16:55 2015 UTC,"Overwhelming majority would mean more than 2,500 people rallying in support of him... I don't think any of us are doing that, not many at the very least.  Most of us just trust our management, and also understand that Voynov coming back isn't OUR choice or even theirs right now, completely crucifying the team for something that hasn't happened yet is pathetic. Some people are being supportive but I'd say we're being realistic at this point.  If the NHL deems him fit to play then he is ours and he will play or he will be traded.  He's still a good player, he probably needs a lot of training and rehabbing but... He's still the same player,  or he could be. He's just unfortunately not the same person he appeared to be."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,nickmakhno,2,Sat Jul 4 17:30:49 2015 UTC,Based on? Haven't seen an overwhelming majority at all. Both are exaggerations.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,Pen2Paper,7,Sat Jul 4 21:38:03 2015 UTC,He's rehabbing a torn achilles. He's not going to be right for another 12 months.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,absoludicrous,2,Sat Jul 4 15:15:47 2015 UTC,Is that what the doctors are saying about his injury? Or is that typical recovery time for a torn achilles? I think it depends on the person. Kobe took close to a year to recover. Erik Karlsson was back within a few months. I'm sure age is a factor too since Kobe is older than both of them.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,Pen2Paper,4,Sat Jul 4 16:26:48 2015 UTC,Recovery is 4-6 months. Karlsson said he didnt feel like himself for a whole year after. Factor in Voynov's conditioning and you've got a mess.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,absoludicrous,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:29:38 2015 UTC,I see. Thanks for the info. I haven't seen anything about his recovery for obvious reasons. Karlsson looked good when he came back though. But it would make sense that he still didn't feel right for a while. That isn't uncommon coming back from injury.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,Pen2Paper,2,Sat Jul 4 17:49:18 2015 UTC,I'm probably being more cynical than necessary just because it puts a sour taste in my mouth thinking of him on our team. I really don't want him back right now.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,banksy_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:50:45 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, he couldnt have felt like himself. That year he only put up 74 points in 82 games, thats very un-Karlsson-like. He must've felt totally off.   Whats your evidence that Slava's conditioning is less than stellar? I havent heard that anywhere."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,Pen2Paper,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"His injury was very likely due to lack of conditioning, being away from proper training for months. If Voynov comes back and puts up 74 points I'll tip my cap."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,banksy_,-1,Sat Jul 4 17:17:02 2015 UTC,"First of all, source? I havent heard that, and if true Id like to read about it.  Second, my point was Karlsson came back and was himself the next season. Maybe he didnt ""feel like himself"" evidenced by his abnormal -15. But he was also playing on a bad team, that a lot of players were heavy minuses on.   Lastly, Voynov has never even smelled 74 points, so dont expect it. And that wasnt my point. I was trying to say that he can fully recover and be the same productive player we knew him to be before this fiasco. Not that he will suddenly be Erik Karlsson, nice spin job though, good effort."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,Pen2Paper,3,Sat Jul 4 17:29:22 2015 UTC,Ok guy.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,nickmakhno,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:43:34 2015 UTC,Chill out. Don't be so defensive.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,banksy_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:39:56 2015 UTC,"Erik Karlsson was back skating within 8 weeks of tearing his achilles. And a torn achilles for a hockey player usually costs him 6 to 7 months, not 12. Source  Voynov had his surgery the last week of March, so he could be healed by August. Definitely by time he gets out of jail. If he begins rehab when he gets out of jail (Mid-October, but that can change) he can be in playing shape by December."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,Pen2Paper,0,Sat Jul 4 16:33:47 2015 UTC,"Skating =\= recovery  Recovery =\= game-ready  Game-ready =\= top form  He's got a couple other things that are possibly distracting his focus, with the jail thing and all that. This is a little more complicated than a generic Achilles injury that you're reading about. If he suits up this year he is a wild-card at best."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,banksy_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"I never said skating was equal to recovery, its a step in recovery. As well as the other things you noted. All of that was understood.   I just cited an example of someone being ready in about 7 months from the day he tore the tendon to the day he was back on the ice. If the Sen's make the playoffs that year it could have been sooner. I get that Voynov has other distractions to deal with, but He could still be healed by August. When he gets out, which would be mid-October at the latest, he can begin rehab and get into game shape. By December or January, provided he has gone through the previously mentioned steps first, he could be ready to suit up. Im not saying he will be the Slava we knew before from day 1*, I'm just saying we can get one of McNabb/McBain/Forbort out of the lineup. When healthy he is our 2nd best D-man and will help us win games."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,Pen2Paper,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:24:44 2015 UTC,He can help us win games by staying out of trouble so we can trade his ass for some value.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,KingsfanMDJ,4,Sat Jul 4 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure everyone wants him to play either. Either way, like u/Pen2Paper said. Achilles injuries are a total bitch to recover from so he won't be back 100 percent either way."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,banksy_,0,Sat Jul 4 15:37:15 2015 UTC,They said the same thing about Erik Karlsson when Matt Cooke cut through almost 75% of his achilles. Dude just won his 2nd Norris and made his 2nd All-NHL First Team.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,KingsfanMDJ,2,Sat Jul 4 16:38:18 2015 UTC,I meant at the beginning of the season. Forgot to add that part.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,lordjedediah,2,Sat Jul 4 17:13:55 2015 UTC,By won you mean stole it from Doughty's deserving hands.
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,thegetawayplan9,3,Sat Jul 4 22:05:51 2015 UTC,wait i think the majority don't want him to play...
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,CrispyLardon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:13:22 2015 UTC,"I can't remember where I read it, but I read that his injury wasn't as bad as it could be and that he would be ready after four months, and he is already like a month into the healing process. But I don't know if I believe it, four months seems too early to me. Or maybe it's four months to heal and however many more months to be back to normal."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,PissOnEddieShore,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:48:00 2015 UTC,"He was training and skating at the Kings practice facility. Slava couldn't practice with them ($100k fine), but worked with some coaches and medical staff. I'd bet his rehab is also at TSC...Once his injury heals he should be physically ready. I'm more concerned about his mental condition. What has this experience done to him? Does he have a fire lit under his ass or is he shellshocked? Nobody knows."
losangeleskings,3c3xoa,ToastedFireBomb,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:50:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the majority want him back, I definitely can't wait to see him lace up, but a lot of people are having trouble moving past some of the stuff he did."
losangeleskings,3c0e78,FHlogin,6,Fri Jul 3 17:01:36 2015 UTC,What? No. Plus he's already been suspended for 70 games.
losangeleskings,3c0e78,Pen2Paper,2,Fri Jul 3 17:23:52 2015 UTC,He's already been suspended. Time to get back to work.
losangeleskings,3c0e78,humbuckermudgeon,2,Fri Jul 3 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"How about they ban him. I don't want him back. Yeah he's good, but fuck him."
losangeleskings,3c0e78,clambam11,2,Sat Jul 4 00:21:48 2015 UTC,"This. He would be seen as a black mark on the kings organization.  Just look at the NFL, where abusive players were allowed to return to the field.  It generate tons of bad press, which is distracting for the team."
losangeleskings,3c0e78,virtualmayhem,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:33:30 2015 UTC,"He should be suspended when he comes back but if he isn't, a petition isn't going to change it."
losangeleskings,3c0e78,lordjedediah,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:26:28 2015 UTC,He was suspended with pay.  That's generally not counted as previous punishment.
losangeleskings,3bydi4,Anarchyisbliss,20,Fri Jul 3 04:20:53 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with letting him play. He's went through the court process and been fined/punished. I don't see the benefit of continued punishment by the league.   That said, if the courts treat athletes lightly because they assume that their employers will mete justice, they aren't doing their job."
losangeleskings,3bydi4,humbuckermudgeon,7,Fri Jul 3 05:23:31 2015 UTC,The league has already set an example by giving him the longest suspension in history of the NHL--almost an entire season.
losangeleskings,3bydi4,CrispyLardon,2,Fri Jul 3 07:15:06 2015 UTC,agreed I feel that the league did a good job of punishing based on a charge but will also do a good job based on a very light conviction. I really do hope he plays because I actually believe he is truly fucking sorry for what happened and actually does want to make things right hence the easy plea. Just my opinion though guys.
losangeleskings,3bydi4,Helios321,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:47:05 2015 UTC,"If the league decides not to ban him for life then I want him to play for the Kings.   There are plenty of players that have killed people, assaulted people, driven drunk (and killed people) that were given second chances.   Voynov has paid the price and will continue to pay the price for his mistake but if NHL is ok with letting him play the Kings don't need more cap issues or lack of dmen issues.   Perfect scenario. Would be a trade for a decent dmen but he has no trade value if he's allowed back."
losangeleskings,3bydi4,Homie_Bama,14,Fri Jul 3 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"I gotta be honest - I really hate the thought of him coming back. Doesn't matter what team. I like football but I hate the NFL for how they treat players who do stuff like this, and I don't want the NHL to get to that level where players are above any sort of regulation. I get that he's getting some punishment, but I don't really feel good knowing it'll be status quo antebellum when he gets back, and he'll go back to being a superstar multimillion dollar athlete. If it was the biggest star on the Bruins, I'd want them gone as well, and I'd never look back. Good riddance. I still love the Kings, but fuck this dude."
losangeleskings,3bydi4,Wheezin_Ed,7,Fri Jul 3 06:57:53 2015 UTC,I get your resentment but if no one got a second chance then where is the hope. I really don't condone his actions and I would never want to be friends with a person like that but at the same time I hope he learns. I hope his violence subsides and he learns respect for himself and others. He also deserves to work and do his job. If nobody hired criminals how would anyone reform. I get the frustration at his high rate of pay because most criminals start at a low wage after their crime but athletes slide right back into money. Maybe some of that money he makes he will put back into a woman's shelter. I doubt that but maybe some good will come out of it.
losangeleskings,3bydi4,Wheezin_Ed,4,Fri Jul 3 07:30:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely reasonable points. Also, just to clarify, it's not his wage I'm upset about. For a lot of people, these guys are heroes. They live in the spotlight, and they're role models to a lot of kids; what message does this send? He's going right back to the glory of the NHL. I also understand how people make mistakes and deserve second chances, and also how being too harsh on people influences rates of recidivism. Criminals can deserve second chances, but I don't think this is much a second chance as it is getting back to where he was before. Are we ready to give him that responsibility of being looked up to again? Is he a suitable role model? I'm one of the people who believe that provides athletes have implicit morality clauses, more of a duty really. What punishment did he endure? How can we be certain he learned his lesson if he probably won't even get ninety days in jail? Not only that, but I'm extremely skeptical of domestic abuse offenders - they have extremely high recidivism rates. Very few offenders beat a spouse once, let alone with the tenacity that he did. Dude has serious anger issues, and I doubt a single off-season is enough to work through his issues. Maybe he can and maybe he has grown as a person, but I'm not sure something as prestigious as the NHL is the stage to gamble on that."
losangeleskings,3bydi4,humbuckermudgeon,3,Fri Jul 3 07:50:34 2015 UTC,I can't speculate to what his nature is whether he is violent or not. Athletes are humans and flawed. I don't expect many people will idolize him or even wear his jersey. In fact I'm pretty sure he will be booed on the road. He will see signs calling him a wife beater at every away stadium. He will be reminded of his transgressions. I agree we shouldn't idolize voynov. There are a lot of kings who are great role models that are higher caliber players that will get more attention I.e kopitar brown quick toffoli. I suppose it's on the parents to police who there kids idolize and what jerseys they buy for their kids. I totally respect your opinion and it's important we have friendly discussions like this. Here have some up votes!
losangeleskings,3bydi4,LAKBurner,-3,Fri Jul 3 11:16:04 2015 UTC,Yeah... they are humans and flawed and very rich. Rich enough to buy their way out of legal problems that would cripple most of their fans.
losangeleskings,3bydi4,flybyknight,4,Fri Jul 3 14:29:11 2015 UTC,"I think he has far more negatives than positives. Lombardi rolled the dice on Richards, gave him a second chance and was burned. Slava has to serve a jail sentence, then rehab his Achilles, then start skating. He hasn't played in a year and there's zero guarantee he'll be the player he was. Then, the Kings and the NHL have the whole issue of perception. Domestic violence is a hot button topic and this is a guy who, in the eyes of the public, beat his wife and went to jail for it. To some, they'll say he served his punishment. There are others though, myself included, who will say, he must have really done something bad if he had to do any jail time. The NHL is entertainment, they sell a product and are trying to grow their sport. Slava Voynov brings little to nothing at a very high price and the potential for a big downside. I wish him luck in the KHL."

I really, highly doubt he meant to make her hit her head on the corner of their mounted TV. I think 100% that he meant to push her away from him, just not to smack her head on the TV. I think it was an accident in terms of the damage the shove did; but it's still no excuse.  And by all accounts they had been fighting all night, with her being just as ignorant. They both need therapy; but it's obvious they love each other. I think it was a freak accident that she got hurt so bad. Which is obvious by them rushing to the hospital with Voynov being worried and at the same time totally not worried about getting arrested--otherwise why would he go if it was intentional?  I also think he was punished enough by the league by setting a record for games suspension--almost a full season. And I also think he got a fair punishment by our justice system--because honestly I didn't expect him to get any jail time at all by the way the case was going.  So anyway, my point is, we just really don't know what happened, so I am going to go with my trust in Lombardi and Sutter--if they think he is worthy to be with us, I will go along with it since they both know way more than any of us ever will know about it. And Sutter is a huge family man, I highly doubt he would let it slide if it was a big, malicious act on Voynov's part.  Plus, when it comes down to it, if we have to pay him, might as well just play him."

Though it is slightly ""high profile"" so who knows.   I actually had to take a step back, go to bed and do other stuff because I realized I was being more pissed than rational about this. Realistically all I really want from Voynov and the Kings org is to actually take steps to be better. Like don't just say words take actions, idk if Dustin still does the Hit Tracker where he donates money for every hit he makes to ICCU but like do something similar with Voynov. Use the LA Kings Cares charity to sponsor a DV safe house (I forget the word for this), and don't just send Bailey or the Ice Crew go with them as a team, etc. because then it would be like yeah we/Voynov fucked up but look we're changing for the better and he'd still get to play.

The team probably loves both of them. And as mentioned by another poster I suspect and have for  a while that they were or are abusive to each other, at least that night. They had been fighting for hours and Voynov pushed it way too far by using his hands. I don't think the shove was meant to cause the damage it did but that doesn't matter. He put his hands on someone else and is being punished. Hopefully the punishment and therapy can help them. Hopefully his wife is helped, and their daughter too.

You're right but remember, suspended players do not get paid.  He can have all the houses on Manhattan beach, pricy lawyers, and contracts but none of that matters if he's suspended.  He still has to pay for all these things so I can see why someone in his position would take the plea.   It's fair to say that the question now isn't ""did he do it"" so much as how far should the punish go from his employers' perspective, those being the Kings organization and the NHL.   I'm not sure if I agree with that statement.  I think if he really did do it then sure, let the justice court/NHL decide how to punish him.  So if the NHL decides not to terminate his contact, then I guess the NHL feels he's been punished enough and maybe he'll turn a new leaf and become a better from this.  I'm worried about the possibility that he didn't commit a crime and would still get wrongly punished.    Remember, our justice system is flawed.  It's supposed to be innocent until proven guilty but nowadays it's guilty and not guilty (which implies they could have committed the crime but the DA did not have ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" evidence)."
losangeleskings,3bydi4,humbuckermudgeon,2,Fri Jul 3 05:41:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you keep getting downvoted - I think now that we see some of the results of the plea bargain, it's easier to understand why he might take the plea even when innocent. If he were innocent (not saying he is or is not or making any judgments, just let's say he is for a moment) and wanted to fight it, who knows how long the trial would last. He would probably be out another season and, like you said, not getting paid and not being able to play at all really.   With the plea bargain, he is now ""punished"" for 90 days (realistically 45 days) and probably maybe won't be kicked out of the NHL or maybe even the Kings. Boom now you get right back to playing in time for the start of the season. Then it probably all blows over like most other civil and criminal scandals in the NHL. Most people would try to not to have any criminal convictions, especially if they're innocent, because it would affect their jobs, etc. But if it didn't affect your life much, would you still spend 10x as much time fighting it (while losing tons of money)? I would guess that this is probably mostly an issue of timing (with the approaching season), rather than innocent/guilty, risk/reward type of thing; it was just the quickest way to settle it with the fewest ramifications.  Personally I don't think I want to see him come back to the Kings. If they let him play again like nothing happened, I'll be rethinking my support of this team a bit..."
losangeleskings,3bydi4,alljake,3,Fri Jul 3 07:31:16 2015 UTC,"I think I'm getting downvoted because it seems like some of the posters are getting emotional instead of trying to think logically.  They're putting themselves or their loved ones in the victim's shoes and it's understandable, no one wants to go through a situation like that.  It also doesn't help with how the media constantly portrays suspects in negative light here in America.  The reason why this way of thinking isn't helpful because people tend to forget the innocent people that go to trials and have their lives ruined by it.  i'm not saying Voynov is innocent or not but until we see more conclusive evidence (e.g. Chris Brown), I wouldn't be picking up my pitchfork anytime soon.     Personally I don't think I want to see him come back to the Kings. If they let him play again like nothing happened, I'll be rethinking my support of this team a bit...   And that's a valid response.  We don't know whether he did it or not but the Kings probably shouldn't just let him start playing again like nothing ever happened.

There are usually financial requirements of a PD however and since I don't practice in Cali I can't comment on them.  That said, you are correct it is an allocation of risk....but based on evidence...Voynov could have been convicted of a felony with higher consequences (sentence and other things) or he prosecution could have lost since the victim wasn't cooperative.  Both sides thought this was reasonable in terms of concessions and he pleaded to it.   That said, it is no longer ""suspicious.""  He was found guilty of the amended charge."

If this happens I have mixed feeling about this because on one hand he went through the legal system and payed for his crime. (He got off very lightly IMO but that's what he was sentenced) And I think we should respect that.

To me, it's not about the player, it's not about the penalty, it's not about time served, or anything else for that matter.

I don't know if Voynov really committed domestic violence or not but I guess if the justice system/NHL/immigrations decides Voynov doesn't to be punished any further then maybe the Kings can keep him on the team. (I know run-on sentence, just woke up from a nap, didn't know/care enough to fix it)  But going back to the point, it's pretty naive to think; even if the Kings do decide to terminate his contract, no other NHL team would not pick Voynov up at a discount.  (Riberio comes to mind)  I think we've all seen enough cases where people's lives are ruined/reputations ruined because of a court case, regardless whether they committed the crime or not.  Should Voynov be given a second chance and hope he becomes a better from this or be treated as a criminal for the rest of his career?

He was subsequently traded to Ottawa for Hossa. Bobby Hull has a freaking statue built of him in front of Chicago's rink and he was  allegedly responsible for beating 2 of his previous wives. My personal philosophy is to separate people from their works or you risk the chance of being disappointed because people fuck up and are flawed.  As far as morality in business goes I don't see how we can sit in an ivory tower and cast judgement on a Hockey club, while we text on devices and wear clothes made by slave labor. I mean I guess you can protest and not come to games.

While I don't have the answer to whether Voynov should come back and play for the Kings, I would like to see the other NHL teams start taking a proactive stance like Lombardi has.

Take your clothing example, you could buy from companies like American Apparel, who make their clothes in Los Angeles with fairly waged employees. Don't like GMOs? Shop local organic produce from farms that don't align themselves with Monsanto. Don't like rainforest deforestation? I hope you know a good recipe to replace that tub of Nutella.  It's possible, but it's not easy. Sacrifices must be made, whether in time, effort, cost, or enjoyment. If people are REALLY taking a moral high ground, then they should consider voting with their dollars and looking elsewhere. Take a real stand and stop supporting hockey if you feel strongly about the issue. Otherwise, accept you're as hypocritical as everyone else and enjoy your cheap clothing, cheap food, store-bought Nutella, and hockey.  I don't condone domestic violence, but if our fucked up penal system says he's paid his due, then there's not much else to be done. This is a business, and hockey is their job. If this were any other job, he would be free to try to rebuild his career with a black mark on his record. Is that not what is happening here too?"

Its the same as most other subs in that it has its circlejerks and hang ups that make it tough for certain fanbases. That's why I want this sub to grow, I imagine this year is gonna be rough for Kings fans and I'd like to still be able to talk rationally with all of you. Lord knows we can't have civil discussions in there about this kind of stuff without someone going on a tirade."
losangeleskings,3bygkc,flybyknight,2,Fri Jul 3 19:51:38 2015 UTC,"The thing that frustrates me is that I get the impression there's a sense of moral superiority (not intentionally referencing the article here) from the sub about this whole situation. Despite this being solely Voynov's fault, it's all somehow blown back onto the organization, which is incredibly unfair. Everyone's talking down from this high horse because it's not their team, they have no idea what's going on."
losangeleskings,3by6ek,LAKingsDave,6,Fri Jul 3 03:16:44 2015 UTC,"I don't see the equivalency between Richards and Voynov. Elliott argues that Richards didn't get a second chance so Voynov shouldn't either.  Certainly, terminating Richard's contract over some border incident involving drugs seems harsh, but we still don't have the entire story yet. I'm betting this incident was the last straw on a long ongoing problem that none of us or the media were privy to."
losangeleskings,3by6ek,humbuckermudgeon,4,Fri Jul 3 14:44:29 2015 UTC,Richards got plenty of chances so that's a pretty moot point by the article anyway.

losangeleskings,3by6ek,JJinVenice,3,Fri Jul 3 04:13:54 2015 UTC,If the league reinstated him and the Kings moved to terminate his contact he would get claimed off waivers in a heartbeat.
losangeleskings,3by6ek,Rimster,2,Fri Jul 3 07:24:37 2015 UTC,If the league doesn't nix his contract then the Kings cannot. To do that the league would have to sign off on that and if they reinstated him then why would they turn around and do that. So we either play him or trade him and we're kidding ourselves if we think other clubs wouldn't take him. Look at Heatley Ribeiro Varlamov and Patrick Kane for an example of how clubs don't care. If you can play then you're worth taking a risk on.
losangeleskings,3by6ek,BW4LL,2,Fri Jul 3 06:09:07 2015 UTC,Varlamov wasn't found guilty.

losangeleskings,3by6ek,humbuckermudgeon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:36:45 2015 UTC,Maybe the Kings &/Or the league will suspend him for 20-30-40 games and that will be viewed as a suitable punishment?
losangeleskings,3by6ek,JJinVenice,3,Fri Jul 3 06:28:19 2015 UTC,"He's already has the longest suspension in the history of the game at 70. I just think after that his jail sentence, community service and counseling  aren't enough for someone then another suspension on top of that probably won't change things. I think either he plays or he doesn't at this point."
losangeleskings,3by6ek,BW4LL,2,Fri Jul 3 06:40:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he sat out because the legal process was occurring. Now that is over, the Kings and NHL are conducting their own investigation and are most likely going to hand down their 'official' punishment. Like in other leagues, the time you serve away does not count towards any official suspension applied later."
losangeleskings,3by6ek,JJinVenice,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:15:37 2015 UTC,I'm hoping the league stays out of it. One need look no further than the DPS to find a complete lack of consistency.

losangeleskings,3bw2a0,Omnivirus,5,Fri Jul 3 03:10:54 2015 UTC,"So if it's a plea deal, does that mean Voynov would be pleading guilty to a lesser offence? Meaning he'd still be admitting to beating his wife?   What then?   The penalty would be variable I'm guessing - jail time, fine, community work, whatever.  But then from a hockey persepective- does he get reinstated? He's already been suspended for most of 1 season- would the league punish further? And what can or can't the Kings do- can they terminate his contract with no penalty?"
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,RubyRhod,2,Thu Jul 2 17:32:31 2015 UTC,"If it's community service, counseling, fine, then I assume he'll be on the team next year."

losangeleskings,3bw2a0,seemonkey,2,Thu Jul 2 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"Pleading to a lesser offense, absolutely. Probably not admitting to beating his wife. Beyond that, pure speculation. I expect no further NHL discipline, a season long suspension would likely be enough. If I was to guess, they'll structure the plea so as to not subject him to deportation. The Kings will ""evaluate"" but will ultimately take him back, Futa let the cat out of the bag a while back and I assume he knew a plea deal was in the works."

losangeleskings,3bw2a0,WoozleWuzzle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:59:35 2015 UTC,"I will have a hard time welcoming him back.  I do believe in forgiveness and letting things go. But it still is a hard pill to swallow and I won't know for sure if he is really reformed in his ways. So my trust would need to be earned back.  I am not as black and white as /r/hockey seems to be. Don't get me wrong I am not by any means greeting him with arms wide open to bring him back.   I also know /r/hockey is giving DL a lot of shit. Letting him practice was not smart. I don't agree with it either. But DL is also trying to run a team and needs to think of this from a business perspective on what he's going to do with the cap and what he can do legally. He's a lawyer after all. People just want DL to just banish Voynov from the get go which would be a very bad business move depending on how things could've played out (what if he was innocent? what if he can't get rid of the contract and then is stuck over the cap?). Then there's comparisons to Richards contract being terminated and not Voynov's.   Richards has actual hard evidence against him it appears, which is different on Voynov's he said/she said original reports. Plus the league suspended Voynov not the Kings so they had less they could do.  I dunno if DL has handled it perfectly, but I don't agree with the persecution he's getting for it.  Either way what Voynov did is horrible. I am not comfortable with it. I don't know how I will feel if he stays a King and plays on the team. I do believe in forgiveness, but it will take time and my trust will need to be restored and that he is reformed.   It's shitty all around."
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,Helios321,2,Thu Jul 2 21:34:07 2015 UTC,"Well if it was as horrible as you describe I feel like his wife would not be as vehemently opposed to testifying as she was even after her mandatory counseling. We can all conjecture as to what happened in their house, but as to what specifically occurred it will always be conjecture. Vs the one hit knock out punch video that other cases have....."
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,WoozleWuzzle,4,Thu Jul 2 22:10:57 2015 UTC,"Well we know the injuries sustained. We know he took a plea deal. So it's not hard to know what happened.   People domestically abused will stay with their attackers for many psychological reasons (he'll change, what about money, how will I survive without him). Also testifying against Voynov would put her situation in a possible worse scenario for her husband and for her. Voynov is her provider which makes the situation much more difficult. But that's not good either."
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,Helios321,2,Thu Jul 2 22:14:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the first part, which is why I mentioned the counseling aspect. I feel like the mandatory counseling the judge sent her to would be specifically to deal with said fear of what to do without him. I just find it hard to cast such a hangmans verdict that everyone is wants to put on him when his own wife has already forgiven him and is almost somewhat pissed that the courts are involved. Even when they were still drunk and he took her to the hospital the statements I read from the hospital worker didnt even look accusatory on her end. And that would be when they were still upset!  I don't thnk I will be one the people booing him or calling for his removal from the team should he be reinstated. Especially after he saved that open net chance from NY in game 4 keeping us alive in OT right before we won the cup. I am just finding it much more difficult to jump to the conclusions all the other judges in this sub have....."
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,WoozleWuzzle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"Again I do believe in forgiveness for people who reform. That's why we have a justice system. You serve your time. If you reformed you never have to see a judge again because you won't do the crime. The question is if he really is reformed. He comes from a different background where this type of behavior is more the norm. So his culture is different and maybe he realizes the wrongs of his way. I don't know. I don't know the guy and because of that I have to keep him at a distance until I can get trust for him.  I'd prefer him not on the team as it'll make things much easier, but we might not have a choice if his contract must be honored. Then we'd have the difficulty of trying to trade him and what team would want him? So we'd be stuck. It's not like we can terminate his contract if he does the time and the league doesn't allow us to. I dunno. It's all strange new territory."
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,Helios321,3,Thu Jul 2 22:35:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know at this point every fan will choose their side. If his wife believes he is worthy of being forgiven and has atoned for his sins, then I believe I will also be doing that. Getting hard to tread this line of not writing him off like everyone else also really not being an advocate of abuse"
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,WoozleWuzzle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:44:07 2015 UTC,Getting hard to tread this line of not writing him off like everyone else also really not being an advocate of abuse   Yep I feel ya. Raw emotions are happening over this and I don't fault anyone with them. I myself am struggling to know what to do with this.
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,BW4LL,2,Thu Jul 2 22:47:23 2015 UTC,"Well said Woozle. I feel like you do about the situation I just think people are kidding themselves by looking at a Hockey club to be a guiding light for societal woes. I'm pretty certain many other teams would be doing the same in the Kings situation, minus maybe the practice incident (still don't get that) but it's a business. Not saying everyone has to love the situation but if he serves his time and follows the courts order then there's isn't much we can do.  I feel like I wanna freeze myself like Cartman and wake up for the first game of the season. All this off ice stuff is just getting absurd at this point."
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,ToastedFireBomb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:18:19 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I feel like it was bullshit that he was suspended in the first place. Innocent until proven guilty and whatnot. He technically hadn't officially been found guilty of doing anything wrong, he should have been allowed to play. That being said, he's doing time, he's making amends, and I see no reason why he shouldn't be given a second chance. I'm a firm believer in everyone deserves a second chance. He is a solid D-man and we are short on the blue right now, no way does Dean just kick him out, it would be stupid. I'm looking forward to seeing him back out on the ice for us, and I'll be cheering his name as loud as anyone else's, if he plays good hockey then he plays good hockey. All the other stuff is in the past, at least from my perspective.  He'll have served his time, paid for the crime he committed, and therefore his debt to society has been repaid, in my eyes. Especially since his wife is such a supporter of his. But I also understand how not everyone feels that way."

losangeleskings,3bw2a0,Helios321,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:00:45 2015 UTC,I believe Kings camp said they want him to play. I have a feeling Lombardi didnt try hard to sign Sekera because he knew Voynov would likely be returning regardless of knowing the particulars of the plea......I would be very surprised if he is suspended indefinitely by the NHl when NFL players have committed crimes and served jail time and always returned to play.
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:15:20 2015 UTC,yeah I think he's playing by the end of the year. Not sure how I feel about that.

Unless Doughty has a year of reckoning in which all those who lie before him are laid to waste......which could happen so you know well see"
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,RubyRhod,0,Thu Jul 2 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"The 90 days in jail is interesting. If we don't terminate his contract too, then the Richards termination looks even more faulty depending on what the specifics of his case are. I dunno. This is all confusing."
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,sonician,4,Thu Jul 2 18:46:48 2015 UTC,"Was thinking the same. DL has almost painted himself into a corner here. He has to follow his own lead now, and terminate Voynov as well, or the Richards stuff looks a lot worse for the team."
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,RubyRhod,5,Thu Jul 2 18:50:33 2015 UTC,"But then he's also doubling down on this sort of interpretation of the CBA. If one gets overturned in a grievance, then so does the other one and we are double fucked."
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,nenright,3,Thu Jul 2 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"Dean doesn't have to do shit. Look, when he found out about Richards, he had three options. Buy out, terminate, or wait. If he buys out, he takes the chance that Richards contract was terminated and he costs the team more money. If he waits, and it isn't terminable, then he misses the buyout window. Only option he had was to Terminate it and see what happens."
losangeleskings,3bw2a0,Helios321,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:18:54 2015 UTC,"Well technically Richards would be accused of drug trafficking wouldnt he.

losangeleskings,3bw2a0,sandypheet,-3,Thu Jul 2 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not gonna lie....if I understand it correctly, he pleaded guilty to a lesser count, which means, he's still guilty but found a loophole to be held to a lesser crime.

losangeleskings,3bw2a0,JackEsq,8,Thu Jul 2 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"He did NOT plead guilty, he pled ""no contest"". No contest is an aknowledgement that the DA has enough evidence to obtain a conviction, while not admitting that you committed a crime."

Trials cost time for them and the taxpayers, and there are no guarantees. Trials MOSTLY settle, them actually coming to a verdict aren't terrifically common. It's also not terribly dramatic, which is why it's usually an extremely minor part of court dramas which gives the appearance of judge's verdicts being more common, which is how most people ""watch court stuff"" (no offense, just honesty).   he's still guilty   yup.   wiggled out of it   Nope, see jail time and probation.   because he ha$ a good lawyer?

losangeleskings,3bwxtu,EricBurger,2,Thu Jul 2 22:13:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's good. He's just a bit smaller than the average goalie and has spent most of his career playing for teams with no defense. Provided the Kings can step up their own defense next season, he should do well."

losangeleskings,3bx2o4,meliwazhere,6,Thu Jul 2 21:29:12 2015 UTC,So has the NHL been waiting to start the investigation? Couldn't they have been doing legwork the whole time.
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,dalbtraps,3,Thu Jul 2 22:07:02 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I think it's proper for the justice department to proceed first.
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,humbuckermudgeon,3,Fri Jul 3 02:18:55 2015 UTC,I guess you're right they might be stepping on some toes if they were to be involved too early.
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,dalbtraps,4,Fri Jul 3 02:23:59 2015 UTC,"On top of that, I find it a little odd that Congress went after the NFL to clean up criminal problems with players as if the employer was responsible for their behavior off the field.  Seems misplaced. If the person commits a crime, than prosecute and put them to trial."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,humbuckermudgeon,3,Fri Jul 3 02:34:16 2015 UTC,"Pro athletes get second chances. I can only think of one pro athlete who didn't get a second chance, Ray Rice. But that could be attributed to his declining skills more than a moral high ground taken by NFL GM's. You can bet some team would take Slava if Kings buyout contract because he is still a very good NHL defenseman. So let's keep him and play him. But he needs to make apologies to the team and to fans. He needs to come out against domestic violence and show genuine remorse. He needs to show us that he is taking steps to change. Volunteer at domestic violence shelter's. Support causes that help victims of domestic violence. He can change. It can be done. You don't have to condone what he did but you can hope he becomes a better person."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,Zbat72,3,Fri Jul 3 02:48:57 2015 UTC,yeah ray rice might still see nfl time I think. He's not that old. Or at least CFL. I just don't see his career being over either. Right or wrong.
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,thegetawayplan9,2,Fri Jul 3 03:31:19 2015 UTC,If he plays again it'll be CFL. his numbers were already skewing down. But if he does play it just supports that pro athletes get second chances. Slava can rehabilitate himself. Hopefully he has the maturity and willingness to get there

losangeleskings,3bx2o4,heyitsEnricoPallazzo,-8,Thu Jul 2 21:59:56 2015 UTC,"There statement is a steaming pile of shit. Basically waiting for the league to do say something so they don't have to make ~hard choices when theyre really freaking easy choices to be made.   Because saying ""We don't support domestic abuser on this team, we are better than that as a team"". Not complicated or hard as all."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,SchroederVanPelt,8,Thu Jul 2 21:45:29 2015 UTC,"Legally, they can't do anything until the league removes his suspension. Once that step is done, the team can then decide what to do."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,sonician,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:55:56 2015 UTC,"No they can't just fire him yet but they can make a better statement about how they don't support that kind of player or person on their team.   Even ""We're disappointed in his actions"" would be more meaningful and a step forward."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,SchroederVanPelt,6,Thu Jul 2 22:00:49 2015 UTC,"Uh, they did:  ""Any act of domestic violence is unacceptable. As an organization, the prevention of domestic violence and the education of our players and employees is of paramount importance."""
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,sonician,-5,Thu Jul 2 22:04:33 2015 UTC,They did a DV class for the team thats it. That and a bunch of non answer indecisive open ended PR responses is all they've done.   Also unless I'm mistaken no one from the Kings (both players or mgmt) have said we are disappointed in Voynov's actions. They've as far as I know talked about this as if its just this person over there who we know but not as this is a person who we've known who we've worked with and we as the employees and possibly friends of. Like its this abstract idea.
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,SchroederVanPelt,2,Thu Jul 2 22:12:05 2015 UTC,What if a person is accused of a crime and the organization they work for fired them and publicly disparaged their name? Then after legal proceedings it was discovered through due process that they person was not guilty of the crimes they were accused of committing. What would happen then?
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,brokeneckblues,0,Fri Jul 3 03:31:38 2015 UTC,"This isn't a what if. It wasn't even really a what if to begin with considering there was a hospital report and witnesses to the aftermath. There were 2 people in an apartment and one of them ""fell"" into a TV bad enough to need stitches at a hospital."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,SchroederVanPelt,8,Fri Jul 3 12:34:01 2015 UTC,That's because they have to wait to see what the League wants to do. The League suspended Voynov so the Kings are unable to do anything at the moment.    It's also far easier to leave their statement open ended and not go into any specifics right now rather than do so with the possibility of having to make a retraction later on.
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,DamnRandall,-3,Thu Jul 2 21:55:58 2015 UTC,"""We don't support domestic abuser on this team, we are better than that as a team""  It's not a hard statement to write. Its really short too. Heck you can change team to organization if you want."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,SchroederVanPelt,7,Thu Jul 2 21:58:41 2015 UTC,"But, with a statement like that, what if the League decides that Slava is OK to play, and is therefore put back on the Kings books?"
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,DamnRandall,-3,Thu Jul 2 22:03:41 2015 UTC,"Okay the league says sure he's good after his community service and year of DV classes but wouldnt it be nice as a team they went naw maybe not, we're better than that and we on a moral level aren't okay with him as a player even if his good at his job. But I can keep holding my breath for that I guess."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,SchroederVanPelt,5,Thu Jul 2 22:10:38 2015 UTC,"What are we going to do with his contract if we have to honor it? Try to trade him? Who's going to take it? We could send him down to the AHL to play but we'd be eating his cap hit. It's lose-lose if that's the case. I don't know what the right answer is, but if we're stuck with him and we have to honor his contract what do we do?"
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,WoozleWuzzle,6,Thu Jul 2 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"If we have to pay him, I say play him."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,CrispyLardon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:52:06 2015 UTC,"Totally not trying to fan the argument, but I do wonder how the team will look at him, and Sutter in particular. With the rumors of locker room problems last season, I'd just love if the most prominent rumors next year were the kind that got Brownie to get a hat trick and a shorty in one game cuz he thought he was getting traded again."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,RayPinchiks,3,Fri Jul 3 04:55:40 2015 UTC,"Would it be nice? Sure. But in the end, you have to remember that this is a business.    I'm in no way absolving Voynov of anything here, just stating facts. As a person, I want him gone. As a fan, I won't be cheering for him. But as someone who understands that major league sports is a business, I know Voynov is a good NHL-level defenceman and his skills as an NHL-level defenceman would be valuable to a team in need of one."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,DamnRandall,7,Thu Jul 2 22:16:00 2015 UTC,"Seriously why the fuck are people looking at a Hockey club to be the arbiters of justice in the world. The amount of disconnect some people have on this case is astounding like they literally feel like he should be locked up and have the key thrown away.   My cousin got the absolute shit beat out of her by her ex husband and you know what he got, basically a slap on the wrist and no jail time. If he got what Slava got I would at least feel like some amount of justice was achieved. Domestic violence is a horrible crime but if someone serves their time and gets help then I would feel a lot better about the situation. As opposed to paying a fine and doing community service or what have you."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,BW4LL,-1,Thu Jul 2 22:29:59 2015 UTC,Right and even from a business stand point is he really worth the money? I know we didn't make the playoffs this year but realistically did we as a team REALLY miss him on the ice. Now into the post season its a little fishy cause a bunch of other stuff changed but during the season was it that big of a lost. But I would be willing to make a pretty (half hearted) good argument for Colin Miller to come up and replace him in the defense.
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,SchroederVanPelt,7,Thu Jul 2 22:23:43 2015 UTC,"Do you remember this past season at all? At points they had to ice only 5 D. It's why Dewey averaged almost 30 minutes a night. Yes, we missed Slava in the lineup. He is a proven solid defenceman."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,DamnRandall,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:28:01 2015 UTC,"As opposed to the average of  25 minutes per game 13/14 season or the 27 minutes in 12/13?   Those extra 5 minutes are hard I know, thats probably exhausting as fuck game after game but also not ~that big of a difference from the 2 previous years."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,SchroederVanPelt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:01:06 2015 UTC,"Let's look at the numbers. Source: Hockey-Reference.com    2013-2014 ATOI with 78/82 GP: 25:43 (2006 total minutes) 2014-2015 ATOI with 82/82 GP: 28:00 (2378 total minutes) Although if you do the math, it comes out to 29 minutes per game. NHL.com lists it as 28:59 (source).  25:43 converted to decimal is 25.72 minutes.  Difference of 3.28 minutes. Do the maths, that's a 11.98% increase in average time on ice.    Also remember, that's an average, which means some games he played less than 29 minutes, some games he played more than 29 minutes. At the outdoor game vs the Sharks, Dewey clocked 32:01 of ice time, and at the time, he ""logged at least 30 minutes of ice time in 27 of the team's 58 games and leads the NHL with an average of 29:28 (source). That is a lot of mileage.    All because Kings either were forced to run 5 D or had to slot in defencemen that Sutter did not fully trust.    I'm not here to change your mind. As is human nature, once someone's mind is set, it's difficult to change. I'm only here to lay out the facts."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,DamnRandall,2,Fri Jul 3 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"Also, I should point out, Colin Miller is no longer in the Kings organ-eye-zation. He was traded with Jones to Boston for Lucic."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,DamnRandall,0,Thu Jul 2 23:07:48 2015 UTC,Well I'm gonna go cry in a corner now. WHY WHY WHY.
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,SchroederVanPelt,2,Thu Jul 2 23:51:09 2015 UTC,"I still say losing Voynov is why we didnt make post season. He was an integral part of our defense that was gone for 90% of the season. We had 5 D-men at one point. Doughty got overworked, and his performance suffered at times (well, suffered for doughty's level), and some of the replacements we brought up were absolute garbage coughschultz*cough. We need Slava, or at least a suitable replacement, and since sekera is off the table, I say welcome home Slava Voynov with open arms."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,ToastedFireBomb,2,Fri Jul 3 00:44:38 2015 UTC,"Or I don't know maybe going to the cup final three years in a row, playing like 250+ games (IDK I can't math well). There was a lot of shit show about this season but to put it all on the lack of a single player is ridiculous.    Also I'm not saying we don't need more defensemen we really do (why the fuck did we trade Colin Miller?!?!??!) but I would rather we not take him back and take the time to find someone else. And even from money stand point having another shit show of a year isn't really going to effect sales that much."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,SchroederVanPelt,2,Fri Jul 3 00:57:22 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely rather have him back, he's a great defenseman who wants to play and is good at it. So what if he made a mistake in his past? He did the jail time for it, why keep punishing him? Everyone deserves a second chance. We aren't gonna be able to trade him, and it would cost more to buy him out, so if we are stuck with him, we may as well use him. I'm not saying he was the only reason we didn't make playoffs, but you can't deny that our defense this year cost us a lot of games. That defense would have been 10 times stronger if slava was in there over Schultz or Mcbain or whichever other Monarch they had up at the time. We fucked ourselves over this year in a lot of ways, but our defense was a huge problem, and it wouldn't have been nearly as bad if we had a guy like Slava in there."
losangeleskings,3bx2o4,ToastedFireBomb,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:02:27 2015 UTC,I actually don't know if they can. Short of trading him he's on our books if he's reinstated. That contract will be hard to get out of since it's a misdemeanor.

losangeleskings,3bwlln,dalbtraps,3,Thu Jul 2 22:10:30 2015 UTC,Sounds like Dean can terminate the contract. Is there going to be a cap hit?
losangeleskings,3bwlln,humbuckermudgeon,2,Thu Jul 2 20:24:31 2015 UTC,the question is will he terminate? it seems like most people in the organization want him back
losangeleskings,3bwlln,nenright,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:54:36 2015 UTC,Well... I'm betting Voynov gets deported.
losangeleskings,3bwlln,humbuckermudgeon,3,Thu Jul 2 22:12:23 2015 UTC,"i dont think that's likely at all. rich hammond from OC Register also thinks its extremely unlikely that they would accept that plea deal had there been any risk of him being deported. also, i dont think its likely that they deport him over a misdemeanor"
losangeleskings,3bwlln,nenright,2,Thu Jul 2 22:15:33 2015 UTC,I hope I'm wrong.
losangeleskings,3bwlln,humbuckermudgeon,2,Thu Jul 2 22:20:52 2015 UTC,"His contact is 6 years, so no recapture penalty."
losangeleskings,3bwlln,anexanhume,4,Thu Jul 2 20:33:41 2015 UTC,So for him to come back there is still a lot of hurdles: Has to not get deported. Has to get out with good behavior in 45 days. Lombardi and Sutter have to want him back. His injury needs to be healed. He has to be in shape and by being in jail that is going to be hard.  It's not looking too good.
losangeleskings,3bwlln,CrispyLardon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"I want him back as well, especially if we still have to pay him. He's our second best D in my opinion."

losangeleskings,3bwlln,CrispyLardon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:57:01 2015 UTC,"Hopefully we an get him back in time to help us come opening day. Good behavior, maybe? We could really use him on the blue line and I for one always liked the way he played the game. I doubt deportation is an issue, or else they wouldn't have reached a deal. Here's hoping he's back in action by the start of this season!"
losangeleskings,3bwlln,ToastedFireBomb,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:02:47 2015 UTC,Even if he gets out with 45 days for good behavior there's still the issue of his injured Achilles Tendon.
losangeleskings,3bwlln,RayPinchiks,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:12:02 2015 UTC,"So essentially this means what, in legal terms? That he's saying ""I'm not saying I did it, but I'm not saying I didn't do it?"" That seems like the same thing as admitting guilt. He's going to jail.    My question is this - in light of the sentence and the fact that he clearly did this (since he's not fighting, right?), do you even want him back if it's somehow a possibility? I don't. I don't think we should support him and I think bringing that kind of person back into a family friendly locker room and organization is poison."
losangeleskings,3bwlln,doot_doot,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:04:56 2015 UTC,"FYI, not a lawyer, but I like law and have a basic grasp on it. It is a good way to just ""get it over with"" and not have to deal with a trial if it is clear the individual is likely to be found guilty. Also, it is a good way to get a lesser sentence than one might get if found guilty through a trial. It is commonplace to do this in lesser crimes.  It doesn't really apply in this case, but doing something like this is also typically a smart move in a case against someone who might later be sued by someone else in civil court. A civil case would take a guilty verdict and basically be an open and shut case in civil court. If a person pleads no contest and is simply punished without being found guilty, it makes it a little more difficult to be an open and shut case in civil court. However, the burden of proof is lesser in civil court."
losangeleskings,3bwlln,Musingmike,2,Fri Jul 3 05:08:36 2015 UTC,"Criminal Lawyer here, they are found guilty if they plead no contest. That's how they get the conviction.   The benefits of pleading NC are vastly overrated by the non lawyer public.  Common misunderstanding though."
losangeleskings,3bwlln,alljake,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"FYI, a lawyer but not in California.  No Contest means he said ""I'm not going to admit I did it, but I concede they have the proof that I did.""  If you plead NC, you are found guilty by the court and it is practically the same effect in terms of sentence, etc.  There are some things (like civil liability) that it can have an influence on that aren't really at issue in this case."
losangeleskings,3bwlln,alljake,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:53:23 2015 UTC,So the point of pleading no contest is to aim for a lower sentence and save money and time on fighting it? Does the court reward defendants who please nc?
losangeleskings,3bwlln,doot_doot,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:49:17 2015 UTC,"They agreed to a plea agreement.  That means each side gave a little to get a little.  The prosecution amended the charges to misdemeanor's from felonies.  Voynov agreed to plead to those misdemeanors and got an agreed to sentence.  Pleading no contest really in his case has no impact and should be ignored.  The bottom line is he was found guilty of the misdemeanor and was found guilty/convicted of the reduced sentence.  Had he went to trial he would have faced being found guilty of the felony and gotten a larger sentence.  The prosecution would have risked him being found not guilty, with the uncooperative victim.  This merely represents an allocation of risk for both sides.  The no contest vs guilty plea is largely irrelevant for this case; the effect is the same."

losangeleskings,3bvhkz,BiohazardPixie,3,Thu Jul 2 17:00:48 2015 UTC,"It isn't uncommon for DV issues to be cases of mutual abuse. Like I don't want it to sound like I am blaming his wife because it isn't like that at all. But  I am willing to say if this wasn't an accident, that it very well may be that the pair of them are dysfunctional and bring toxicity to one another.  That doesn't make it okay to hit anyone, and people should be punished for physically injuring one another. I just don't think this is a case of the big bad hockey player who uses his helpless wife as a punching bag on a daily or weekly basis.  Photos though would show a difference between a small cut that bled a lot as head injures tend to, whether or not there are red marks on her throat [bruising wouldn't happen that fast but obv you'd still likely be able to see trauma to the throat] and the like.  It is easy to presume guilt yes,  that is what it sounds like, but this is still a difficult thing to jump from one side to the other, for me at least. I would really like to believe he is a good person and that some how something somewhere was blown out of proportion you know?   But mostly, I'd like to see them all get help, if not for the sake of the adults so much, but then for the sake of their daughter.  She can walk away, he can walk away but that child cannot go anywhere unless someone is willing to take her, and if this situation is as bad as it seems she needs to be tended to first and foremost. Even if it isn't so bad, this child still needs to realize this isn't a normal situation and be reassure that she won't have to live through it again."

losangeleskings,3bu074,RubeusShagrid,4,Thu Jul 2 04:01:33 2015 UTC,Agree 100%. We are definitely good enough as is. And I get the feeling that Lombardi knows something about the Voynov case that we don't; I feel like he thinks we are getting him back--especially after all that talk of him getting a deal before the trial begins.
losangeleskings,3bu074,CrispyLardon,4,Thu Jul 2 04:43:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if he's found innocent, I think I'd be okay with having him back.   What does that say about the US justice system where a man found to be innocent can't get his old job back because of a stigma surrounding him?"
losangeleskings,3bu074,RubeusShagrid,4,Thu Jul 2 04:45:26 2015 UTC,Ditto.
losangeleskings,3bu074,CrispyLardon,3,Thu Jul 2 04:47:33 2015 UTC,But has he been off the ice long enough to affect his play?
losangeleskings,3bu074,lakingscrzy,2,Thu Jul 2 04:52:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe. But if he's been keeping up with his work outs, it might not be too bad."
losangeleskings,3bu074,RubeusShagrid,3,Thu Jul 2 05:06:28 2015 UTC,He's recovering from a torn achilles... brutal injury to rehab. Also with the court stuff hanging over his head... shitty situation.
losangeleskings,3bu074,Edmuresay,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:47:00 2015 UTC,"Before his injury he had been training still to keep conditioning up. Who knows how bad his injury has mussed up that plan now, though."
losangeleskings,3bu074,CrispyLardon,4,Thu Jul 2 15:09:25 2015 UTC,True that! I mean everyone else is playing catch up to us. I guess we'll see! Gkg
losangeleskings,3bu074,mrsambo99,3,Thu Jul 2 04:04:12 2015 UTC,Totally agree we have a legit top 6 and a great net minder!
losangeleskings,3bu074,TURD_F3RGUSON,2,Thu Jul 2 04:00:37 2015 UTC,As well as great ownership and management. My buddies and I will definitely being renewing our season tickets. GKG!
losangeleskings,3bu074,LOUD__NOISES,3,Thu Jul 2 04:42:07 2015 UTC,Our top 6 is filthy. We'll find a Top 4 Dman. We never sign on day one of free agency.
losangeleskings,3bu074,LAKingBob,2,Thu Jul 2 07:12:45 2015 UTC,Are there any left?  It seems like the better defensemen are already gone.  The remaining ones probably realize the demand for defensemen and expect to be overpaid
losangeleskings,3bu074,alljake,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:24:39 2015 UTC,"I think Voynov is back, and if he isn't I'm okay with the top 4 we have.  Lots of injuries this year and continuity in the bottom 2 will help."
losangeleskings,3bu074,rockkon,-3,Fri Jul 3 03:56:29 2015 UTC,"Let's recap a bit.  Kopi had a hard time last season.  That 70's line tanked mid-season.  We have no scoring depth beyond the top 6.  We've got a huge hole on D.  I'm not sure we even make the playoffs again.  I think it'll depend on how well (or how sucky) EDM turns out to be.  I hope I am wrong, but let's hold the Kings responsible instead of deluding ourselves like we all did last season."
losangeleskings,3bu074,RubyRhod,3,Thu Jul 2 13:43:55 2015 UTC,"You do realize that we suffered two huge chemistry issues, Pearson went out for the season, and Martinez had a concussion for 2 months right?   Our division is tough and it is feasible we do finish in second to last place, but considering it's looking like Voynov might come back, it's also very possible we get 2nd place in the division too.    I'm not sure we even make the playoffs again   Way to be dramatic."
losangeleskings,3bu074,rockkon,-1,Thu Jul 2 17:57:25 2015 UTC,"You do realize that we suffered two huge chemistry issues, Pearson went out for the season, and Martinez had a concussion for 2 months right?   What does that have to do with anything?  We might have three huge chemistry issues this season.  We might have none.  My point is the Kings do not seem to aim high enough during the regular season to make up for unforeseen circumstances.  The attitude of ""just make it in"" does not allow for screwing up games against Edmonton or Calgary the way we did last year.  And, now, Edmonton and Calgary are much stronger.  The Ducks have a strong team and the Kings may not be able to summon the intensity they will need to make the playoffs.  That's assuming they can overcome the distractions of Stoll, Richards, and Voynov.  I am depressing myself, but this is a grim situation."
losangeleskings,3bu074,RayPinchiks,2,Thu Jul 2 20:06:58 2015 UTC,"Aww come man buck up. DL has the rest of the off season to make some cool shit happen. Plus he still gets to do his magic around trade deadline.  The boys will have fresh legs this year. Hopefully the locker room will be different. Losing Williams hurt, but part of me felt like he wasn't pushing very hard at the end of last season.   We picked up Lucic, that'll be interesting. Some of the young studs coming out of the AHL could fill in nicely. I mean the Monarchs did just win the Calder. And I remember when DL traded Johnson and said Voynov would be a better D man, and I sat there thinking HOW? How could this AHL'er be better than Jack Fucking Johnson. Then we won the cup that year. So maybe we're not as bad as you think.   Also feel free to rub it in if a year goes by and we didn't make the playoffs."
losangeleskings,3bu074,rockkon,2,Thu Jul 2 23:20:01 2015 UTC,"feel free to rub it in if a year goes by and we didn't make the playoffs   But, I don't wanna rub it in... I wanna make the playoffs!"

losangeleskings,3btsfi,thegetawayplan9,2,Thu Jul 2 03:03:13 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, you're probably right. Now that they have kessel they probably have the best top 6 in the league. Too bad they have 0 depth so it wont matter from a cup contender standpoint"
losangeleskings,3btsfi,Phridgey,2,Thu Jul 2 03:06:06 2015 UTC,"They have a LOT of 3-3.5m players that play like >1m players. Terrible depth outside that top 6, and almost no defense to speak of."

Excited for the future."

losangeleskings,3bruzf,wowiekazowie,4,Fri Jul 3 06:56:59 2015 UTC,"I'm can be happy with this.  He's as Number 2 goalie as it gets. His numbers aren't great, but that happens when you play with BUF and DAL.   Hopefully the cap hit stays around his previous $1.25m. Looks like it will be exactly $1.25m"

losangeleskings,3bruzf,RichieCski,2,Wed Jul 1 17:23:58 2015 UTC,Solid backup.
losangeleskings,3bruzf,KobeBasedGod24,2,Wed Jul 1 17:33:48 2015 UTC,"I like it. Good backup with experience, also gives JF another year to develop."
losangeleskings,3bruzf,EricBurger,2,Wed Jul 1 17:37:13 2015 UTC,This is very good.  Heard lots of good things about Enroth when he as in Buffalo. He should make a great backup without feeling the pressure that he wants to be a starter somewhere.
losangeleskings,3bruzf,hobonia,2,Wed Jul 1 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"I think we could put most any Goal Tenders in our system and it would set them up to succeed. I'm really not all too worried who we have, because we have always had a knack for strong back-ups.  With Berube, i have a slight hesitation towards him. I has Reign season tickets since the beginning, and moved to Oregon for Uni the year he went up to the AHL. From what i remember, he was a great GT, but cracked badly under pressure, and his mental game WAS (not saying is not) fairly bad. If he were to let in a bad goal, it would be a nightmare for the rest of the game. I'm not all too sure on how much he has progressed, but it sounds like he is doing great. Thats just my two cents.   EDIT: wording"
losangeleskings,3bruzf,FHlogin,2,Wed Jul 1 18:24:20 2015 UTC,Now we just have to worry about our defense.  And the whole Richards debacle.  Sigh.
losangeleskings,3bruzf,niomosy,2,Wed Jul 1 19:05:16 2015 UTC,One Enroth is worth about three 401Ks.
losangeleskings,3bruzf,anexanhume,4,Wed Jul 1 19:43:12 2015 UTC,I'm so confused why Lombardi would pick up a losing tendy over Berube.  Unless he sends Enroth to the Reign.  EDIT:  I see why DM wants Berube to stick with the Monarchs.  More playing time.
losangeleskings,3bruzf,Live_Positive,14,Wed Jul 1 17:26:41 2015 UTC,He wants Berube to play.  If we brought him up he'd get to watch a lot of hockey.
losangeleskings,3bruzf,Doomhat,13,Wed Jul 1 17:27:42 2015 UTC,Because Berube isnt ready. Enroth is a quality backup and a lot better than Berube
losangeleskings,3bruzf,wiseaus_stunt_double,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"The only problem with that is what do we do with Barto?   He's definitely AHL-ready and needs playing time to develop, too.  I guess we can platoon them, but I just hope that doesn't hamper their development."
losangeleskings,3bruzf,kramjam,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"Bartosak will take over the AHL job, if not for 15-16, then 16-17. I think next season JF and Bartosak will go 50/50 or 60/40"
losangeleskings,3bruzf,Thumper13,3,Wed Jul 1 18:14:58 2015 UTC,Enroth is a solid pickup. Let Berube to continue to develop versus sitting and watching
losangeleskings,3bruzf,RubyRhod,3,Wed Jul 1 17:32:34 2015 UTC,He's better than his stats. Experienced.
losangeleskings,3bruzf,wowiekazowie,2,Wed Jul 1 17:46:08 2015 UTC,He was a losing goalie on the tanking Buffalo Sabres. It's like how Scrivens was a losing goalie on a tanking Oilers.
losangeleskings,3bruzf,Zanchbot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:25:26 2015 UTC,Don't let Enroth's numbers fool you. Think of the team he had in front of him this last year and a half. Most of the time he kept the Sabres in games until the bottom fell out every 3rd period.
losangeleskings,3bruzf,annoyinglyclever,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"So was Berube not considered NHL-ready enough to back up Quick? Enroth is a small guy, he'll require some solid D in front of him."

losangeleskings,3bsuey,loginlogan,4,Thu Jul 2 06:18:41 2015 UTC,"Almost certainly too expensive, though at the right price I could see it working out for him here.  On a semi-related note, rumor has it Shattenkirk could be on the move. Not a free agent (2 years left on his contract at $4.25 million per year) but he could be worth consideration if true, wouldn't he? That's less than Sekera was asking for. Of course something tells me the Blues' asking price for him would be too steep for any deal to make sense, but a guy can dream, can't he?"
losangeleskings,3bsuey,antifolkhero,3,Wed Jul 1 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"Apparently their asking price is really high on Shattenkirk, so I think the Kings would be out."
losangeleskings,3bsuey,anexanhume,2,Wed Jul 1 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"The Blues will be looking for a significant return. I'm not sure the Kings have what it takes to get him. I would love to have Shattenkirk on the squad, he's a great defensemen."

losangeleskings,3bsuey,fooliodoolio,3,Thu Jul 2 23:43:40 2015 UTC,Too expensive because of his experience. Not that good of a player compared to the other UFAs signed today. Kings are better targeting Ehrhoff.
losangeleskings,3bsuey,CrispyLardon,4,Wed Jul 1 22:17:20 2015 UTC,I think it makes sense for us to Ehrhoff the side of caution.
losangeleskings,3bsuey,doot_doot,2,Wed Jul 1 23:23:50 2015 UTC,"you were gonna say no matter which team he would have signed with, right? :)"
losangeleskings,3bsuey,Nougatizer,2,Wed Jul 1 23:46:54 2015 UTC,"He's so old that he probably is more worried about years over money. I say we give him like 4-5 years at 2-3 mil a year, lol."
losangeleskings,3bsuey,niomosy,2,Wed Jul 1 22:53:34 2015 UTC,"He's not even on our radar. Too expensive, too old. We don't need expensive and old."
losangeleskings,3bsuey,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"He crossed my mind yesterday, but will probably end up being too expensive, sadly."
losangeleskings,3bsuey,seemonkey,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:46:17 2015 UTC,Oduya will most likely cost more than the Kings can afford.  I don't see it happening without some additional players moving.
losangeleskings,3btu30,leflur,6,Thu Jul 2 02:34:06 2015 UTC,Why didn't we keep him at that price?
losangeleskings,3btu30,lordjedediah,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:38:24 2015 UTC,"Wondering the same thing. Obviously a long term deal was out of the question, but if he was willing to take less term/money it would've made a lot of sense considering Lucic being here now, and Williams wanting to play for a playoff club."
losangeleskings,3btu30,CrispyLardon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:40:15 2015 UTC,Maybe he didn't want to be a third liner?
losangeleskings,3btu30,CrispyLardon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:42:37 2015 UTC,"He played third line more than a few times throughout this past season. He can play more than just the top 6 roll and in my opinion he was quite effective at both. Sure he isn't a first line guy anymore, but he did a lot of good no matter where or with who he played with."
losangeleskings,3btu30,BumDiddy,2,Thu Jul 2 02:43:54 2015 UTC,"I mean, I definitely wanted him to stay. I'm just saying maybe he wanted a bigger role for his remaining few years before retiring."
losangeleskings,3btu30,CrispyLardon,2,Thu Jul 2 02:45:04 2015 UTC,"Yup.  got me wondering.. which player holds the record for winning the most Stanley cups won on different teams (excluding coaching/front office/etc.)  Edit: I found the information you were dying to know. Jack Marshall in 1900's-10's. Besides that, a few players have 3. If Kings don't win it all, hopefully J Will joins that group."
losangeleskings,3btu30,CrispyLardon,2,Sun Jul 5 00:32:53 2015 UTC,Agreed.
losangeleskings,3btu30,Dr-Dinosaur,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:50:26 2015 UTC,Very true.
losangeleskings,3btu30,BW4LL,2,Thu Jul 2 02:48:02 2015 UTC,And I am sure he knows just as well as we do that the Caps are close to being big contenders if they can get a clutch playoff player like himself.

losangeleskings,3btu30,nenright,4,Thu Jul 2 02:42:44 2015 UTC,Thank god it's not Anaheim. I was honestly thinking they might get him since they have an open spot on the top line.
losangeleskings,3btu30,LAKingBob,2,Thu Jul 2 02:44:29 2015 UTC,Agreed. That would've been awful.
losangeleskings,3btu30,EinsamWulf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:48:23 2015 UTC,They never were in contact according to a few sources
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,BW4LL,6,Wed Jul 1 22:58:52 2015 UTC,I have a strong feeling we roll with the team we have. DL learned that you can't ride so close to the cap like that and retain young talent. Look at Saad and Hamilton. I like the Enroth signing and I really like Lucic on the top line.   Still interested to see were Williams go.
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,anexanhume,2,Wed Jul 1 23:01:34 2015 UTC,The Bruins could have kept Hamilton. They were just idiots about it.
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,thegetawayplan9,4,Wed Jul 1 23:23:29 2015 UTC,but Hamilton didn't want to stay in Boston. That was the largest issue there.
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,anexanhume,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:01:51 2015 UTC,"Well then not much they could have done to retain him, right?"
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,humbuckermudgeon,3,Thu Jul 2 00:15:28 2015 UTC,Here's an updated listing of available defensemen..
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,anexanhume,2,Wed Jul 1 23:07:34 2015 UTC,Defense: Lubo or Ehrhoff on a 1 year deal.  Forwards: Stay pat.  Goalie: we're good.
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:27:38 2015 UTC,I agree on Defense but I doubt we can get them to take 1 year deals.
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,anexanhume,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:00:48 2015 UTC,PIT got Ehrhoff to do it. He wants to be on a contender. Lubo is 38. He can't expect too many years at his age.
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,anexanhume,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:13:17 2015 UTC,But are either of them 2D worthy? I'd rather role with Marty and McNabb and just save the cap space. I'd things are working then maybe make a trade at the deadline.
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,anexanhume,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:00:15 2015 UTC,"Ehrhoff had a really bad year in Pittsburg, but before that, his underlying numbers were phenomenal. Lubo is still great at preventing shots. They both have the potential of being fine second pair D.  What assets/picks do we have left for another deadline move?"
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,GummiBearMagician,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:02:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah good point on the assets, I think the team is just waiting on the Voynov situation to play out. If he makes a plea deal I honestly think they bring him back. Not sure how I feel about it but it is a business and he's way better then what we get on the open market and for cheaper."
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,Anarchyisbliss,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:11:43 2015 UTC,I have no doubt they bring him back. Rumor is that teammates want him back. I don't like it and it's really hard to imagine an outcome where it looks like he's genuinely trying to improve himself on a personal level and not just doing what the court asks.
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,banksy_,2,Thu Jul 2 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"Between here and /r/lakers, it's been an infuriatingly quiet free agency period for LA sports fans..."
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,banksy_,2,Thu Jul 2 03:41:43 2015 UTC,I hope we just chill and roll with what we have. Let the kids play! Our d will look something like doughty muzzin Mcnabb Martinez and green forbort/mcbain. Doughty will cover a ton of minutes and play with everyone and we can kill with green Mcnabb muzzin doughty Martinez. I know it's not ideal but the sky isn't falling
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"If we were to sign/acquire a D-man who do you guys want? I think Oduya would be my pick, but I wouldnt give him more than 3 million x 3 years."
losangeleskings,3bt5ng,banksy_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:14:08 2015 UTC,That's not bad but I'm not sure he'd go for it.

losangeleskings,3bt6q5,FreakAss,11,Wed Jul 1 23:07:25 2015 UTC,Yeah probably will always be stuck in Anze's shadows. Gasper doesn't seem to have the talent to make the NHL. Hopefully he can step up and get to the AHL at least. I wonder what he will do next year since the ECHL is moving out of socal.
losangeleskings,3bt6q5,thegetawayplan9,3,Thu Jul 2 00:00:26 2015 UTC,he might just go back home and play for his dad

losangeleskings,3brpy9,MagicArc,12,Wed Jul 1 16:43:31 2015 UTC,Sucks to see him go. He seemed like a perfect fit with us.
losangeleskings,3brpy9,TheNickster,7,Wed Jul 1 16:44:17 2015 UTC,Sekera trade at the deadline was for a first round pick (now 2016) and prospect  Roland McKeown.

What is left for us to consider? Franson? I'd like Martin... but his cap hit is way too high, I think. However, we could use a solid defensive defenseman (no more Regehr)."
losangeleskings,3brpy9,bryan_sensei,2,Wed Jul 1 17:06:39 2015 UTC,Still some solid D-men out there...just have to find the one that works into our cap situation.

losangeleskings,3brpy9,WoozleWuzzle,12,Wed Jul 1 17:31:40 2015 UTC,I don't think the Oilers are going to be on the bottom for long. They have a lot of young talent.
losangeleskings,3brpy9,thegetawayplan9,7,Wed Jul 1 17:39:29 2015 UTC,this has been said about the oilers literally every offseason since 2007
losangeleskings,3brpy9,krucz36,2,Wed Jul 1 17:49:10 2015 UTC,Except now they have the most hyped prospect since Crosby and they're building a franchise around him.
losangeleskings,3bt04e,The_Creepin_Kitten,5,Wed Jul 1 22:16:04 2015 UTC,I don't think the Kings will be active in the free agent market until they know the outcome of the Richards and Voynoc contracts.
losangeleskings,3bt04e,LAKBurner,2,Wed Jul 1 22:23:53 2015 UTC,Richards contract is no longer the Kings problem. That will be resolved by the NHL and the NHLPA.
losangeleskings,3bt04e,lordjedediah,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but until the NHL announces a ruling the Kings could be liable for the Richards buyout. The NHLPA does not want this case to set a precedent for teams to get out of bad contracts. It is possible the Kings get out of the contract, it is also possible that they won't, it's also possible that LA will be on the hook for at least a portion of the buyout figure. Until Dl knows what is going on he isn't going to make a move. Expect some laers from the AHL to fill the gaps. They are cheap, know the system and are 30 miles away from Staples Center."
losangeleskings,3bt04e,PissOnEddieShore,4,Wed Jul 1 23:46:48 2015 UTC,"Mike Richards does not have a contract. It was terminated by the club and approved by the NHL. Based on the rumors and silence from all sides, Richards fucked up. It might not even be something the NHLPA wants to fight.   The Kings may be responsible for any real money owed to Richards but I don't see how they can put his contract or buyout back on to the Kings salary when they approved the termination."
losangeleskings,3bt04e,lordjedediah,2,Wed Jul 1 23:49:28 2015 UTC,Worst case scenario we are held liable for what his buyout would've been.
losangeleskings,3bt04e,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:04:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought if Richards fought it and won, the Kings would have to buy him out. I didn't know the NHL and NHLPA pay for the buyouts."
losangeleskings,3bt04e,LAKBurner,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:50:58 2015 UTC,Not willing to over pay for a guy who can be hit or miss defensively. I followed Toronto a bit the last 2 years and I just don't see him as an upgrade for our team. Like others have said Kings aren't gonna do anything crazy today. We usually never do anyways.
losangeleskings,3bt04e,BW4LL,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:28:24 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that he didnt preform as well as Nashville hoped, would possibly lower his cap hit, last year it was 3.3mil and i could see DL making a deal for possibly 2.9 which is totally within reason."

losangeleskings,3brw7l,hobonia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:32:13 2015 UTC,The thing about the Sekera trade was that we didn't give up any of our defensemen in the deal.  Worst case we roll with the pre-trade defense and try to ignore the fact that we got burned hard on that trade.  If we can pick up a decent bottom pair guy somewhere that wouldn't hurt.
losangeleskings,3brw7l,thegetawayplan9,5,Wed Jul 1 17:33:10 2015 UTC,We gave up a great defensive prospect.
losangeleskings,3brw7l,hobonia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:58:46 2015 UTC,I meant more in the sense of roster defensemaen.   Only losing one roster d-man makes the immediate pain a lot more manageable.

losangeleskings,3bpaem,Doomhat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:47:19 2015 UTC,It was the Canada side.  Even on the US side it would be up to the charged person to inform their employer.
losangeleskings,3bpaem,black296tuuk,2,Wed Jul 1 02:51:49 2015 UTC,Just a thought on this subject.  Maybe  the Kings organization has some sort of code of conduct that would require any player that has a run in with the police to notify the team. You would think the team would have a pretty clear policy after the Voynov issue.  You could even speculate that the material breach was not the investigation/arrest but the fact that it wasn't reported.
losangeleskings,3bpaem,rockkon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:42:12 2015 UTC,"In all of this chatter I remember reading something like it wasn't the incident so much as the response to the incident.  but, then, I am cluelessly repeating what some clueless somebody said at one time."

losangeleskings,3boudr,lordjedediah,16,Tue Jun 30 23:16:31 2015 UTC,"First I'd like to say fuck tmz as a whole. However if this info is correct, is this enough to terminate the contract if he isn't convicted?"

losangeleskings,3boudr,doot_doot,2,Tue Jun 30 23:44:37 2015 UTC,"It depends on the ""crime"" he committed. But if he is found to have possibly transported even a small amount of oxycodone across an international border, without the requisite prescription, he could possibly be facing travel limitations on his visa.   I only put crime in quotes to be fair to MR because no one will confirm what happened yet, and I have no way of knowing if it's a crime or not.  edit: as I typed that comment The Winnipeg Sun is the second to report actual details"
losangeleskings,3boudr,banksy_,5,Wed Jul 1 01:38:00 2015 UTC,According to this it'd be pretty hard for the Kings to make it stick.

losangeleskings,3boudr,BW4LL,3,Wed Jul 1 00:35:36 2015 UTC,"Lawyer?  To add, what irks me about him is that he seems to have settled in his mind that this is going to end up in a ruling against DL for Cap Circumvention. There's no way that he knows how this will play out. If the allegations are true, which is looking likely, there's absolutely grounds for termination of the contract on material breach. No denying that the NHLPA is going to put up a fight but I can't imagine that the NHL will be okay with players running into legal issues after being caught with drugs on them. AFAIK, there's no Zero-tolerance policy in place, but I'd be damned if we're not on the road to getting one implemented in the near future."
losangeleskings,3boudr,cloudyskies41,2,Wed Jul 1 00:40:27 2015 UTC,"One thing that I've always appreciated about hockey is that it was the last (semi) American sport that still took sportsmanship and honor seriously, at least compared to the other american sports. I mean look at fucking Sean Avery. No one will touch him because he's a total douche (among other things). In one year the Kings are starting to look like the Baltimore Ravens of Hockey. I think that alone will be enough for DL to distance himself from Richie. If he finds a new home and lights a new fire under his ass then good for him. Philly tossed him because of ""alleged"" cocaine issues, and then LA got two cups out of him. Maybe this is the kick in the ass he needs to get his shit back together. Here's hoping. He did well by us I think."
losangeleskings,3boudr,RayPinchiks,2,Wed Jul 1 06:05:57 2015 UTC,"The reality is, the public actually gets perverse pleasure out of this crap. Look at all the drama and BS in the NBA and NFL...

Investigation now at two-week mark.      Richards has not been charged. A person with OxyContin pills and no prescription could face smuggling charge under the Customs Act... 1/2..      2/2...  or possession charges under the Criminal Code's Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. OxyContin is a narcotic pain reliever.   So it looks like he was arrested."

He could have an amazing year, but then if he spends the next season playing a handful of games it won't go well. We literally just saw this happen with Jones.

losangeleskings,3bndv1,Zanchbot,10,Tue Jun 30 17:29:04 2015 UTC,I think Kings fans are overrating him a bit. He was phenomenal in 2013-2014 but definitly dropped off in 2014-2015.   The Kings defense was much better in 2013-2014 and his starts in 2014-2015 were few and far between. He could be solid but I think San Jose overpaid.
losangeleskings,3bndv1,joeloud,23,Tue Jun 30 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"Well we're absolutely putting a top notch defense in front of him. And not just Vlasic, either. I mean, the rest of our D could easily be top blue line for any of the ECHL teams!"

losangeleskings,3bndv1,subtleintensity,7,Tue Jun 30 21:43:21 2015 UTC,"He tied a league record, going 8-0-0 in his first 8 starts. Among those wins was shutting out the Ducks in a 9-round shootout.  He was pretty solid for a backup, and I'm going to hate us playing against him."
losangeleskings,3bndv1,iisdmitch,5,Tue Jun 30 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"He's a great backup, but not at the level Bernier was when he left, for a comparison.   I don't think he's ready to be a #1 quite yet, but he's getting there. He can definitely split time until he proves that he can start 55+ games a season in the NHL. I could see him being an undisputed starter in a couple of years. Nothing but potential, and he has plenty of time to get better."
losangeleskings,3bndv1,ovorc,2,Tue Jun 30 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"I do like the fact that he's 25. Sharks have been trying to go younger this season and last, and this looks like it fits in. Rumor has it we're bringing in a new goalie coach too so hopefully that'll change things up."

losangeleskings,3bndv1,IgoRStripes,3,Tue Jun 30 17:39:45 2015 UTC,He's really solid. Nice size and I'd say above average athleticism.  Deserves the shot at being a #1.
losangeleskings,3bndv1,RichieCski,3,Tue Jun 30 17:30:13 2015 UTC,He's pretty damn solid. I'm pretty sure we couldn't have made the playoffs in 2014 if it wasn't for his help with Scrivens.
losangeleskings,3bndv1,subtleintensity,2,Tue Jun 30 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"He's a great #2, but we'll likely see how he does as a #1. Overall, he's not ""bad,"" but in comparison to, say, Bernier... not quite there. However, he is young and also hasn't had as much time to shine per se either.   That said, the Kings didn't really want to offload him... but it was either him or Berube, and Berube is a bit younger and cheaper, so they decided to keep him around, with a heavy reliance on Quick."
losangeleskings,3bndv1,struckbyarhthmstick,2,Tue Jun 30 19:25:07 2015 UTC,best way to relate this.....if i had to choose Jones or Stalock as a starter...I would choose Jones

losangeleskings,3bndv1,Quakee,6,Tue Jun 30 18:59:16 2015 UTC,"So according to /r/hockey the biggest reason for this deal was to fuck over the Kings, am I understanding that right?"
losangeleskings,3bndv1,BiohazardPixie,10,Tue Jun 30 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty solid move on his part. Sharks had no goalie's, he had a few, he flipped Jones and got a ton for him. /r/hockey has some awesome people in it who know what they're talking about. It also has a ton of morons who don't know shit about hockey in it who just like to chirp based on flair."
losangeleskings,3bndv1,subtleintensity,3,Tue Jun 30 18:59:47 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah no I know it's a good move for the Sharks, I just meant that the only part that many people seem to care about is ""how pissed off the Kings are gonna be."" It's just goofy."
losangeleskings,3bndv1,TheNickster,4,Tue Jun 30 19:05:16 2015 UTC,I mean... they're not wrong in that I am pretty pissed about it. Any time you play against a goalie who knows your players it gives the goalie an advantage. He friggin lived with one of our top scorers. super.
losangeleskings,3bndv1,wizardmami,3,Tue Jun 30 19:06:26 2015 UTC,You would think that goes both ways though. One of our top scorers has lived with their goalie.

At the same time, while I think Jones is an amazing goalie- people are acting like Price, Rinne, and Quick all have their size and skill set combined into one goalie and that Jones is going to wreck the whole league.  He's good and I want him to have a good career but I am unhappy about this indeed :( Couldn't they have sent him to Florida or something with Willie?"

losangeleskings,3bn2qf,CrispyLardon,11,Tue Jun 30 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"So no charges yet, but serious enough to void his contract and to have both the RCMP and Border Services involved? Crazy."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,sonician,6,Tue Jun 30 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"The acknowledgement of police involvement allows pieces to start to fall into place. The most puzzling thing about yesterday was the lack police involvement, since the universe of things that would lead to his contract being terminated but did NOT involve police was so small as to exist almost wholly in our imagination. Now that we know police are involved, it's much more possible to imagine things.  Plus, with the acknowledgement of the involvement of border control agents, the tidbit about an incident at the border is also confirmed, so it's looking more and more likely that Richards tried to bring something illegal across the border. Still, anything that he'd try that would land him in this kind of trouble would almost certainly have resulted in his arrest, and there's been no word about that yet.   We know that it happened June 17th, but Lombardi only found out about it on the day of the draft. So, what the hell was happening in those days between the incident and the draft? Why did it take so long for Lombardi to find out? If Richards was indeed arrested, would we know? Or is it possible that in that period of time he was arrested, posted bail, and released?"

losangeleskings,3bn2qf,sdguero,2,Tue Jun 30 21:07:46 2015 UTC,Yeah but this time it actually helps the team.
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,JackEsq,8,Tue Jun 30 19:15:00 2015 UTC,I wonder if the material breach is simply that his Canadian Passport has been revoked without charges having been filed. If he can't travel he can't uphold his contract...  Edit: Found this link on /r/hockey legal analyst for TSN says it's not sufficient to terminate the contract...so the speculation continues...
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,James445566,3,Tue Jun 30 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"This happened many CBA's ago, but Bob Probert couldn't cross the border for a while and the Wings didn't terminate him  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Probert#Detroit_Red_Wings_.281985.E2.80.931994.29  Probert's career hit a snag in 1989 when he was arrested for cocaine possession while crossing the Detroit-Windsor border.[3] U.S. Customs agents at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel found 14 grams of cocaine hidden in Probert's underpants.[4] He served three months in a federal prison in Minnesota, three more months in a halfway house, and was indefinitely suspended from the NHL. The NHL lifted the suspension at the conclusion of his prison term.[5] Probert was initially ordered to be deported to Canada following his conviction, but he immediately filed for an appeal. The appeal process allowed him to resume his career with the Red Wings, but barred him from traveling with the team to Canada, as he would not be allowed to return to the United States. The matter was resolved on December 7, 1992, when the Immigration and Naturalization Service granted his appeal, restoring his travel privileges between the United States and Canada.[6]"
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,niomosy,3,Tue Jun 30 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"In this case, though, wouldn't it be Richards unable to travel into the United States?  That eliminates Richards practicing with the Kings and he would be unable to participate in the vast majority of games."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,James445566,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"Good eye, wasn't thinking about which direction each player was going when they got caught (allegedly caught in Richards' case...just in case)  So yeah, the Probert comparison probably isn't the best"
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,niomosy,2,Tue Jun 30 17:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that caught my attention.  Still, It still seems like some Canadian teams might still try Mike out, hoping to get some on-ice experience shared to younger players while  waiting for him to get his legal issues squared away to be able to travel.  While the breach of contract certainly does make life easier on the Kings, I'm still wondering if DL needed to use it or not.  Part of me looks at Richards and thinks, it's the mistake the Kings made.  The Kings just have to accept that they gambled and lost.  Buy out the contract or trade for whatever you can.  Take your lumps and move on."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,Stillnotathrowaway,2,Tue Jun 30 18:05:07 2015 UTC,"It seems the timing of that doesn't fit. He doesn't need to travel in the offseason, right? The team doesn't have any jurisdiction over his movements until training camp and official team activities can start.  I almost wonder if he has a clause about disclosing legal problems and the material breach is the act of not disclosing."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,JackEsq,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:43:19 2015 UTC,That's a good point about training camp. Also it something big enough that a trade is no longer a possibility.
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,Stillnotathrowaway,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"something big enough that a trade is no longer a possibility.   I think that might be a big part of it. His value to the team as a tradeable asset damaged the ""heart"" of their agreement.  I really just wish they would say what happened. If it is criminal, this is being handled so differently from any other player that it will be an interesting appeal. If it is less severe than Voynov beating his wife there will be a stark contrast in regards to waiting on due process for Voynov but not for Richards.  Let's say it is drugs. it would have to be more than possession, like Staal. If it is in distribution level quantities why wasn't he already charged?"
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,agentdcf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"If this is possible, this is likely, in my view. Can Border Services seize a passport without charges, or perhaps without even an arrest? (Though it is possible he was arrested and we just don't know.)"
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,JackEsq,2,Tue Jun 30 16:56:47 2015 UTC,"I looked it up:   the Minister may revoke the passport of a person who...(b) uses the passport to assist him in committing an indictable offence in Canada -Source   I put emphasis on ""indictable"", meaning you don't have to be actually charged, just that you could be charged."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,sops-sierra-19,2,Tue Jun 30 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"This is a bit of Canadian legalese. There are three types of offences in Canadian criminal law: indictable, summary, and hybrid. The first two are rough equivalents for your felony and misdemeanor respectively.  Hybrid means that the Crown gets to decide if they want to prosecute the crime as a summary of indictable offense."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,JackEsq,2,Tue Jun 30 19:46:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for the clarification"
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,agentdcf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"So this might be our winner right here. If his passport had been revoked, then that is the grounds for material breach of contract, not whatever he did that got it revoked; this explains why there's no need for him to be charged or convicted in order for Lombardi to feel not only that he could, but that he should terminate the contract.   This is also a pretty straightforward piece of information that could land in the Kings' front office, literally on their table at the draft. The news comes to Lombardi: ""Richards's passport has been revoked, he's under investigation for ____""; Lombardi then cannot continue discussions for a trade, since Richards cannot reliably carry out his contract."

losangeleskings,3bn2qf,agentdcf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:00:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm... so either it's something else entirely, or the passport has been currently revoked and Lombardi has reason to suspect that travel restrictions will be long-term or permanent, even if they are not now. That still means he's taking a hell of a risk, which seems out of character for Lombardi."

losangeleskings,3bn2qf,agentdcf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:14:29 2015 UTC,"Though we should note that there are few precedents in this matter, right? And all relating to other sports, and all some time ago. Further, if the event that precipitated the termination was the loss of a passport, then the incident itself almost doesn't matter--only the loss of the passport and travel privileges."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,DoktorJeep,2,Tue Jun 30 18:16:26 2015 UTC,"By all public reports, it appears Richards has legal trouble in Canada. Would that situation limit a person's ability to travel across the border? If so, could this prevent Richards from working for the Kings? Assuming yes, is that a material breach of contract?  Gotta admit, this speculation is killing me. Loved the trade for Richards at the time, and you'll get no argument from me over how important he was for both cup wins. At this point though, if the Kings can get out from this cap situation and get rid of MR at the same time, Don Lombardi will once again pull off the improbable."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,krucz36,2,Tue Jun 30 16:50:19 2015 UTC,Jesus fuck we need some fucking clarity on this. The speculation is nuts.
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,iisdmitch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"I know Richards wasn't performing well and while we don't know all the details, whatever happened made Dean cut Richards. That being said, why not cut Voynov when his thing came around? I know Voynov WAS performing so does this mean Richards investigation is more serious or does it mean Dean was looking at anyway possible to get rid of Richards and this was an out?"
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,agentdcf,7,Tue Jun 30 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"That's possible, but look closely at Peter Chiarelli's comments about Lombardi's behavior at the draft. ESPN reported that   ""He came right over to me,"" Oilers general manager Peter Chiarelli confirmed to ESPN.com. ""He pulled me aside and said, 'Hey, Pete, this is going to come out. I had no idea. This is important you know so that talks [don't go any] further.'""   This doesn't sound like some kind of calculated choice to take advantage of Richards's indiscretion; there are considerable costs to this whole legal maneuver, and it's not obvious to me that the negative press and further damage to the Kings' reputations is worth the money potentially saved in a buyout. Plus, the ideal situation would have been to trade Richards, and from Chiarelli's comments, Lombardi actively ended negotiations in that direction.   What this points to is that something so serious has happened that Lombardi felt forced to terminate Richards's contract. This is consistent with some of the vague comments that came out yesterday, in which people who claimed to be in the know described the incident as ""yikes"" and ""wowzers."" Something very bad and very unusual happened here."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,toadman3,2,Tue Jun 30 15:45:55 2015 UTC,Voynov was a contributor to this team and Richards was a detriment with his contract being what it is. that's the difference. hate to be that guy but lets call a spade a spade. if the Ray rice thing hadn't have happened you wonder if Voynov would have even gotten any sort of punishment just like Varlamov.
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,iisdmitch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking. Let the Voynov thing play out. If he's found innocent, he comes back but I wouldn't be surprised if he is found innocent and gets traded."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,sonician,4,Tue Jun 30 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"Voynov is still technically innocent until proven guilty in a court. Once the decision comes down, the Kings will act accordingly. But, they can't do anything until that time. (As far as I understand it)"
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,jinqsi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:43:43 2015 UTC,So then how do they get away with terminating Richards right now?
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:47:19 2015 UTC,we dont know what he did. Also maybe legal things work different in Canada. IDK.
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,thatsmyaibo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:12:19 2015 UTC,That's true in legal terms but the evidence is there and Voynov's name is sullied. My guess is you won't see him in the NHL again.
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,agentdcf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:21:06 2015 UTC,But so is Richards; he hasn't even been arrested yet. That's one of the really odd things so far.
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,BiohazardPixie,4,Tue Jun 30 15:46:38 2015 UTC,"Richards wasn't arrested, he did something that could [did?] allow his contract to be voided though."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,agentdcf,3,Tue Jun 30 15:51:28 2015 UTC,"First, do we actually KNOW that he wasn't arrested? We really know nothing about what happened from June 17 until the draft, when Lombardi found out. It's not impossible he was arrested and released in that time. He didn't post that picture of himself fishing on twitter for a few days as well.   Second, if what he's ""done"" is a criminal matter that allows his contract to be terminated, then how do we know he ""did"" it? Isn't that the purpose of the trial?   I'm not disagreeing with you, so much as pointing out the gaping holes in the narrative that is emerging."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,BiohazardPixie,4,Tue Jun 30 15:55:07 2015 UTC,"Voynov = Arrested, public matter that was reported on. He was immediately given court dates, innocent until proven guilty. He's guilty = contract termination. Innocent = He's ours to put on the ice or trade or whatever.  Richards = did a thing against his contract, allegedly, bad enough for said contract to be terminated [PA was informed before Lombardi did it], the legal matters will potentially [depending on the NHLPA investigation] come after in which the Kings termination will be okayed or vetoed.  If he has court dates related to an arrest they will come up at some point, and even so him hiding that from the team is probably a thing he can't do."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,agentdcf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:59:48 2015 UTC,"You're not understanding my point. If there are going to be arrests, charges, and court dates, then Richards has not in fact ""done something"" in a legal sense, since the purpose of the legal proceedings is to determine if he has in fact legally ""done something.""   Further, Richards's contract was terminated for a material breach, not just a regular breach. It's not like he skipped practice or told Sutter to fuck himself or something. A material breach is something that changes the nature of one of the parties or of the contract itself, that makes it impossible for the contract to be fulfilled. This is the rub with this whole situation: what on earth could have happened that apparently does not need to be demonstrated in court (and thus is of dubious legal reality), but that renders Richards not only in violation of his contract, but unable to continue to uphold it?"
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:04:42 2015 UTC,"I do understand your point.  But as I said the court dates are likely to come later, Richards also has the chance to lawyer up if he wants.  This is uncharted territory in the league, we don't know if Richards is actively seeking advice and what not. He was released from his contract- that will be happening either way. Either via buyout, trade or termination in which the recapture fee will come into effect.  Richards has the ability to go to a new team, which he would have had the ability to otherwise [except for a trade]. This isn't a matter of 'We terminated him to get him out of LA' it was happening anyway, we were going to trade or buy him out.  So the logic of it sounds a bit backwards right now, yes.  However there is something being investigated, this is the time in which both sides collects whatever evidence they have if this will proceed in court, so his contract is terminated right now, what comes next will be to determine if  that sticks or if the what happened was completely unjust, in which case the Kings will likely be paying him what his contract says he is owed. I don't think if someone wants to fire a contract employee, that they go to court before hand to find out if actually can. The court part tends to come after in which both parties have to prove their claim of yes it was, or I did nothing wrong, and then at that point  someone gets paid despite being fired, or they are just fired.  There is also the chance that if Richards actually did this mystical thing and its that bad that he won't even fight it, I doubt it, but anything is possible."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,agentdcf,2,Tue Jun 30 16:22:58 2015 UTC,"But if one has to wait until Voynov's guilt is legally established in order to void his contract, how can one void Richards's contract before charges are even filed? The Kings cannot simply void a contract based on the suspicion or allegation that Richards has done something, since he is not legally guilty of it.  I don't think a simple crime is what's happened here, for that very reason. Further, the simple act of a crime is not enough to constitute a material breach. It may be a violation of the terms of the contract, but it's still possible that one would be able to uphold the terms of the contract. There has to be something else going on here, because by the definition of material breach, Richards cannot carry out his part of his contract."
losangeleskings,3bn2qf,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:53:51 2015 UTC,"Yes... yes they can.  A contract isn't like this great impenetrable protective order that prevents you from being fired. Richards was not arrested, he was not being put through the courts before hand therefor the Kings don't have to wait. They're taking the risk of being wrong and losing big because they feel like he messed up real bad."

losangeleskings,3bn2qf,MagicArc,2,Tue Jun 30 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"DL found out an hour before the draft, he couldn't continue trade talks knowing this was going to come out, so he halted talks and decided to waive him knowing that the incident violated the team contract and they could simply term it rather than buyout.  It will set dangerous precedent, but these guys should be held to higher standards.  I go to my job loaded on coke I don't get assigned to rehab, I lose my job, just like these guys should.

losangeleskings,3bjnnp,BagelzAllDay,3,Mon Jun 29 19:50:16 2015 UTC,My thought is that Dean had something on Richards for a while now that he could use to terminate his contract. He told Richards to pick up his act or he would use it. Looks like hes using it and Richards knew he was going to.
losangeleskings,3bjnnp,Chriskills,7,Mon Jun 29 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, think this was in his back pocket the whole time, and when he couldnt get anyone to bite on the trade he was forced to use it.  My vote is coke."

I say get Sekera and then use the rest to re-sign Kopi and if Lucic has a good year get him done for next season.  We need to start giving some of these kids a crack at the lineup and Williams creates a log jam. Plus Lucic was brought in to take his place.

losangeleskings,3bjdv3,dalbtraps,7,Mon Jun 29 21:09:06 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. Money aside it makes Richards look pretty bad, essentially not following rules or listening and most teams won't want to pick up a guy like that especially when he's not playing like Mike Richards a handful of years ago."
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,BiohazardPixie,3,Mon Jun 29 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"It depends. If he breached by refusing to train with a team he knew didn't want to retain him then that doesn't look all that bad, but would be direct disobedience of a request which would be considered a breach.

losangeleskings,3bjdv3,CannedMango,7,Mon Jun 29 20:16:21 2015 UTC,"This is another route altogether.  LA is going to go through the courts rather than the collective bargaining agreement of the NHL.  If the Kings have solid ground and evidence that Mike Richards is in breach of his contract to a serious extent, it's possible to have the contract waived entirely and have no cap hit at all.  However, this is not something the NHLPA is going to take laying down since it would have far reaching implications going forward about how teams handle bad contracts and what sort of relationship owners and players have.  You can imagine a whole new slew of clauses being added to contracts that players have to adhere to, and players being kept tabs on to ensure those requirements are met.  That would not sit well with players and would damage relations in general.  I don't know how this situation will end, but it's not going to foster any good will between owners and players, that's for sure.  Edit: Apparently I was wrong about the cap hit, the termination clause would still have 1/4 of hist contract against the cap for the remainder of the term.  But not the 10 hit against the cap that a straight buyout would have."
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,agentdcf,3,Mon Jun 29 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"This IS the buyout.  Actually it's not, it appears to be a bit of legal ju-jiutsu to avoid the cap hits."
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,thegetawayplan9,6,Mon Jun 29 18:36:59 2015 UTC,well no. If this goes through than this is better than the buyout. Its basically he avoided the contract we are done and walk away. No buyout cap hit for the rest of eternity.

losangeleskings,3bjdv3,CrispyLardon,3,Mon Jun 29 18:46:54 2015 UTC,I get the feeling Richy helped them out on this--I really do. But I'm an optimist. xD  But I guess it's more likely Lombardi is just doing more Lombardi things and being amazing at his job. Or maybe Lombardi made this an off the books gentleman's deal with Richy last year as a condition of giving him one more shot?
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,superguardian,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:49:24 2015 UTC,"If it turns out to be a side deal of some sort and the league ever found out, the Kings would be in deep shit. It'd basically be the most blatant case of cap circumvention to date - more so than the initial Kovalchuk contract. While it was patently ludicrous to believe that Kovalchuk would play in the NHL at 44 for something barely above the league minimum, at least it was theoretically possible for him to claim that he would.   In the case of some sort of side deal between Richards and the Kings, there's no plausible reason for things to go down this way other than an attempt to circumvent his cap hit in the event of a buyout. Presumably, under any gentleman's agreement, he'd get paid something close to what he was owed under a buyout, else there's no reason for him to accept the deal (not to mention the Kings could have used the compliance buyout on him last season to get him off the books if they really wanted to). If the Kings weren't trying to dodge the cap, they could just buy him out using a normal course buyout and do everything above board."
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,CrispyLardon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after some more digging it seems something happened that not even Lombardi knew about until an hour into the draft."
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,superguardian,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That's what makes it even stranger - it must be pretty serious, since Lombardi was apparently in in talks with Calgary / Edmonton but stopped the discussions when he found out.   Now there's no guarantee a trade would have materialized, but the fact he was in talks with Chiarelli and Treliving means that people were interested in taking on Richards at some price. The fact that he immediately stopped those discussions once he found out suggests it must have been some real serious shit."

losangeleskings,3bjdv3,SchroederVanPelt,3,Mon Jun 29 23:06:24 2015 UTC,Im gonna put my tin hat on for a second and suggest maybe if Richards was injured in some way last year was not honest about said injury - like straight up knowingly lying about it because players have a terrible habit of playing through injuries - and they trusted him and didn't let him go last season. Only for him to have a shit show of a season this year and then slacking over the summer. They could have been like fuck it. We tried. And considering the person that he was when they took him from Philly and the people they've kept in LA short of him having murdered someone in a back alleyway really what could he have really done? And LA obviously has to think he's not gonna fight it or whatever they have is gonna win if he/NHLPA fights it and the potential what 15 mil fine if they lose (I could be pulling the fine number out of my ass btw).   Taking my tin hat off.

We'll write you a good referral if anyone comes asking."""
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,superguardian,4,Mon Jun 29 20:31:59 2015 UTC,I don't think so - Richards is owed $22M on his contract (2/3rds of that if he is bought out). There's no way he leaves that much money on the table to do the Kings a favour.
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,GummiBearMagician,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is tin-foil-hat territory, but AEG is a bit of a splash the cash to do what needs to be done to win sort of company -- maybe it wasn't that he's a bro, but the price was right. They could scratch his back a bit off-the-books style and he leaves in a way that helps the team.  The timing is all sorts of right, with the free agency window within spitting distance. Also, missing a few days of training when you're in a rough team situation is unlikely to raise too many eyebrows with other teams looking to sign him. Seems a bit convenient to me."
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,superguardian,4,Mon Jun 29 19:37:56 2015 UTC,"I agree it looks awfully suspicious (and convenient) timing-wise (especially when combined with Richards' declining output) but what Lombardi has done is basically the nuclear option in terms of management-player labour relations.   While some out of court settlement would ""technically"" benefit everyone (Richards gets money and is FA, no cap hit implications for the Kings - as you say, they have the actual cash to spend, just not the cap space to do it cleanly), but doing it this way is probably way worse for labour relations in the league as a whole - the NHLPA will see it as an attack on guaranteed contracts, and that's definitely one issue they will not let go."
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,kiwirish,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:43:21 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't think so either, but it could allow Richards to still play in the NHL just for less money."

losangeleskings,3bjdv3,MagicArc,4,Mon Jun 29 20:10:12 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, this makes Lombardi's ""biggest mistake"" comment mean even more.  Because had he just bought him out last year they both would have been happy, now he basically has to fuck 10 out of money to save the team....totally makes sense now.  He had this in his back pocket the whole time, he just didnt want to have to use it.  I wonder if it was 10 who gave 28 the coke in vegas."
losangeleskings,3bjdv3,Pen2Paper,2,Mon Jun 29 19:48:16 2015 UTC,A different perspective is that if Richards' underperformance was due to his choices or even illegal doings then he was fucking LA out of money and a chance to grow the franchise.

losangeleskings,3bk9li,doot_doot,3,Tue Jun 30 04:45:32 2015 UTC,"So far here's what we know: - It was a one off ""incident"" not a health issue - It happened at the border - In an interview with TSN, Eric Macramalla (who knows what happened but won't say what it was) referenced a potential issue with the Kings organization revolving around the ""temptations"" in bigger markets like LA.   If he's making an argument about a possible systemic issue it stands to reason that it's either domestic violence or drugs/alcohol. Since it was an incident at the border and he referenced ""temptations"" that also makes me think drugs/alcohol. We know those rumors have surrounded Mike for a while, so based on everything we know right now, it looks like some sort of drug related issue at the border. There's no word about an arrest floating around out there, so that is a possible wrench in this theory, but that's where I'd put my money for now."
losangeleskings,3bk9li,StuffinHarper,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:00:30 2015 UTC,Another thought. Could it be PEDs.

losangeleskings,3bhfz5,strategolegends,2,Mon Jun 29 19:18:19 2015 UTC,"In some ways, it's refreshing. People talk about the Dodgers and Lakers as if they're teams with ""all flash and no substance"". So it's good that people acknowledge the Kings as the tough, physical team that they are. Of course, then they tip the scale too far in the other direction, and call the Kings ""dirty"". How many times have we seen a player from another team make a hit that is deemed ""awesome"", when a similar move from a Kings' player is deemed ""dirty""? It's just frustrating."

First person to pass out definitely got Saran wrapped to a light poll out in front of the hotel on numerous occasions. I being a victim once of said tradition. One time one teammate got so drunk he thought it would be funny to take a shit in another teammates helmet and he did. It was pretty damn funny to be honest. And we'd all laugh about it.   You gotta roll with the punches and have fun with life period. I'd have drinks with any opposing fan. We could even make a game of it, which I do with one of my friends whose a Ducks fan.

The Kings even unveiled black jerseys to celebrate getting Gretzky! We've been ragged on for a long time for stealing Canada's golden boy- and in this sense, it's especially easy to hate on the Kings.   Never forget our history! We are kind of like the bad guys. That's why I like this team.  Now with a couple of cups, Lucic, legal battles all summer I'm cool with being hated. It's good to be a hated hockey team."

The compliance buyouts stated the player being bought out could not re-sign with the team that bought him out for one year.  There were then rumours that Tampa Bay and Toronto were planning a deal that would see Lecavalier traded to the Leafs, bought out  by them and thus free to re-sign with the Lightning on a cheaper deal. However, the league stated that a manoeuver like this would be seen as circumvention and penalized."

losangeleskings,3bgi1w,LAKingBob,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:58:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of Richards and I hate seeing him go, but where was the Richards that you've highlighted in this video.  Richards wasn't making plays and hits like this for the Kings.  He had some good stuff, but nothing like when he was with the Flyers."
losangeleskings,3bgi1w,nine7sicks,2,Mon Jun 29 05:41:47 2015 UTC,"In 2012 he was starting to heat up late November and December before getting concussed then showed up again in the play offs. In the following shortened year and playoffs he was great. During that run before Bolland concussed Richards, him and Carter were arguably performing better than anyone on the team."

He got injured early in the 2013 WCF's and who knows what would've happened in that series had he been able to play the entire thing.  He wasn't as noteworthy, but he certainly helped get the Kings their second cup in 2014.  The Flyers may have been slightly more entertaining to watch in the regular season with Simmonds and Schenn, but if you consider playoff excitement, the Kings won the Richards trade hands down and bar none.  We knew the price going in.  Before winning a cup every single fan was willing to pay that price just for ""one time"".  We got two, nearly three and Richards' leadership lives on well past his physical contributions.  Thanks Mike, for the excitement and the success... and for being such an influence on Carter and the rest of the boys."

losangeleskings,3bgeml,Sniffman,2,Mon Jun 29 10:55:42 2015 UTC,"Cernak - A Steady 2 way D-man, good skater, sees the game very well, puts himself in excellent position to defend, plays with an edge to his game, never shys away from contact and usually wins the puck as a result. Needs to develop his ""O"" but even if he doesnt he can be a top 4 defensive D. Potential top 4, 2-way D if he does develop the ""O"".  Dergachyov - NHL Size right now (6'4"" 200), a strong player on the puck and along the boards, Skill and smarts is apart of his skill set as well but is still developing, The last sentence of this scouting report sums it up best, ""a sizey power forward that has all of the technical skills to be successful in his role as a scorer, and versatile in the lineup as a gritty grinder.""  Wagner - Speed to burn, very good skater with top end speed. Creative in the offensive zone, but needs to work on* his timing making passes/taking shots, but decision making is good. A hard working 2 way player that is continuing to round out his offensive game to make him a more complete player.  Schmalz - If Dergachyov is big, Schmalz is HUGE. 6'6"" 210. A big power winger that is learning how to play 6'6"". Drives the far side post, instead of near side. Already uses his frame well, and learning how to use it effectively in all situations. If he didnt play for a bad team, offensive numbers would be better.   Reddekopp - Sound Defensive D-man, Plays physical, makes a safe first pass when leaving the zone, plays PK but no PP time, He is risk averse; will make the safe play but lacks creativity in the O-zone. Skating needs to get a bit better. Projects as a LH Matt Greene.  I dont know much about Matt Roy, and there isnt much by way of scouting report, so I guess we will just have to wait and see on him. If anyone has a scouting report on him, feel free to add it here.  edit: a word"

It absolutely breaks my heart to see something like this happen to a guy who was such a great player, and declined so quickly.  If it's his prerogative to try to continue playing, I wish him success, but at the same time, if he takes his buy out and decides to just go fishing everyday, he earned it.

losangeleskings,3bd8n2,CrispyLardon,4,Sun Jun 28 03:27:09 2015 UTC,he's the best defensive forward that we have. who's on your first PP unit if you had to make one?
losangeleskings,3bd8n2,wiseaus_stunt_double,2,Sun Jun 28 04:12:17 2015 UTC,The only problem of have Kopitar on D on the PP is that you want someone with a strong shot from the point playing D; Kopi doesn't shoot from the point and always dangles and scores his goals in close. We can keep really just keep the top two lines along with our top 4 D out there -- we shouldn't have to juggle things around as it already fits.

losangeleskings,3bdkc9,SDSU_goalie,4,Sun Jun 28 05:12:22 2015 UTC,"He has claimed that money was not his first priority, but apparently the Kings made a pretty close to fair offer to him and he turned it down. So it looks like he may have burned his bridge or something in making it seem that money is his first priority, especially if a bad team makes him a big offer that he signs. In losing Williams they lost a true first line winger, and Lucic actually slides into that role on the current team perfectly. He is a physical guy which also works with the team. I'm interested to see how they patch up the top 2 defensive pairings because right now, Martinez isn't a top 2 defenseman."
losangeleskings,3bdkc9,hopesfail,3,Sun Jun 28 06:06:48 2015 UTC,"As someone else on /r/LAK mentioned; while Sekera showed promising chemistry with the team (especially McNabb), I don't think he would be worth what he's asking for considering the Kings' cap situation and the somewhat serious injury he got last season.  With that said, I won't forget that Kopitar assist against the NYI anytime soon..   To be honest, I wasn't happy about the Lucic trade either but after much discussion with the rest of the reputable LAK posters I think it might be a good thing.  Lucic does have that physicality the Kings enjoy using (maybe a bit too much at times) and he's not bad of a player.  Sure it would be nice if his contract could last a little bit longer but if it doesn't work out, Lucic's cap hit could go towards Kopitar's contract update (if he earns it)  Regarding Martinez, I don't think he's that bad of a player.  I seem to remember Muzzin committing a crap ton of turnovers or own goals this past season.  I don't think Muzzin should be in the same pairing as Doughty."

But, if he was looking for a ton of money, I think lietting him walk was the right idea.  The Lucic deal makes sense because the Kings are still in the window to contend, and he helps them now. As much as it hurt to lose Miller and the 1st rounder, it makes sense.  While Martinez was serviceable, when he had to play top 2 minutes, he looked outmatched for the most part.  I would be really interested to see if the Kings deal for Phaneuf. A chance to play for a cup, in a market where you aren't under the microscope, he could get really comfortable and thrive, which would be awesome with Doughty here too."
losangeleskings,3bdkc9,hopesfail,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:00:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think there were rumors of him getting 5-6 million on the open market while the Kings could probably only afford around 4 ish.  I like him as a King and I got excited a couple of weeks ago when there were talks of the contract being close to done/Sekera wanted to stay.  But if it wasn't meant to be, it wasn't meant to be.  You're right; if the Kings are going balls to the wall, Lucic would be a great addition to the team.  I just didn't agree with it at first because I tend to think long term rather than short but this is a professional sports team not my life haha.  Regarding Phaneuf, apparently there were some rumors about Phaneuf for Richards and/or Martinez and/or one of the young forwards.  I'm not too fond of the idea as Phaneuf's cap hit is 7 million until 2022.  It doesn't make sense to replace Richards' contract when Phaneuf's is 1.25 million more and 2 years longer.  Oh and Phanuef is 30 years old btw.  The Kings would be stuck with him until he turned 37."
losangeleskings,3bdkc9,LAKingBob,2,Sun Jun 28 08:12:35 2015 UTC,"The thing about Lucic that many here will not appreciate, is that we basically got their ""identity"" player. We got their version of Dustin Brown (closer to his prime). Thats a pretty big deal."

If we can sign Williams and/or bring up kids who could fill the gap and fall under cap that would help us more than signing him to keep him and ultimately being fucked later."
losangeleskings,3bdkc9,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"He's our oldest D-man now the Reg has retired. He's coming off a horrible knee injury and he wants  over $4 mil a year. We have $4.9 million to spend on two defenseman (Regehr and Voynov) a backup goalie and Stoll's replacement. He was the best option at free agency last year, but I don't see him as essential. Petry kind of messed everything up with his contract, so it'll be interesting to see what we end up with."
losangeleskings,3bdkc9,LAKBurner,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:35:09 2015 UTC,"Greene is older, and Sekera is only 29.  The injury part is a big factor, though, but the fact that we do have depth in Manchester makes that decision easier."

losangeleskings,3bbrss,toadman3,2,Sun Jun 28 17:31:45 2015 UTC,"You can't rate a draft until 3-4-5 years down the road. These guys will not see NHL time for several years, and that's a really good thing. It gives players time to develop and it's how you score the gems in the 2nd-7th round who can contribute at the NHL level. Look at Muzzin, Martinez, Voynov, King, Nolan, etc. All these guys spent significant time in the minors and they're better NHL players as a result.  The impression I get from DL is that the Kings haven't drafted for need since Thomas Hickey. They take the players who they think will develop the best no matter the position. And frankly, you can't really argue with that philosophy. They've done really well. DL likes to use prospects as trade bait so it doesn't hurt to have players of all positions.  Furthermore, with the way the Kings core is laid out now"

losangeleskings,3bazi3,NorthAquarium,2,Sat Jun 27 15:28:32 2015 UTC,I see a bunch of fans have been talking about his decline recently. What has been the main cause of his lack of production?
losangeleskings,3bazi3,Zanchbot,7,Sat Jun 27 15:59:43 2015 UTC,"A number of things.   Losing N. Horton on his opposite wing, numerous injuries to Krejci at the C, although he did look pretty good last year with Spooner and Pastrnak as a line.  A key thing to keep him engaged is to have linemates that push the pace to force him to be active each and every shift."
losangeleskings,3bazi3,Nothingiswrongwithme,4,Sun Jun 28 02:46:19 2015 UTC,"Thornton made Lucic more aggressive IMO. So that is another factor.   Make Lucic mad and he either does something dumb, punches someone out, or scores a key goal.  He is a mixed bag, but when he is on a tear watch out.   People hate on him because of the dumb shit he does, but I also believe they hate on him cause he is scary."
losangeleskings,3bazi3,BiohazardPixie,3,Sat Jun 27 14:23:58 2015 UTC,"I think Lucic is going to have the line mates he needs here to maximize his potential. The expectation seems to be that he'll be playing on the top line with Gaborik and Kopitar. Kopi is as great a centerman as they come and we all know Gaborik can score as well. Even if we only get 15 - 20 goals out of Lucic, that'll still be an improvement over Brown, Williams, or King, basically the only other players who have spent regular minutes on that line.  I'm probably in there minority here but I'm actually really coming around to the idea of Lucic being on the Kings."
losangeleskings,3bazi3,BiohazardPixie,2,Sat Jun 27 14:43:03 2015 UTC,"Most B's fans say it was te wrist surgery, Krejci missing time, and Horton/Iginla's absence. Lucic has the tendency to look uninterested and lacking motivation. Same things were said about Horton. But, they always brought it in the post-season. I think the change of scenery and desire to prove himself to his new mates will do wonders for Luc. Things were stale all around in Boston this year. Lucic played better when he was put with two faster, energetic youngsters late in the year."
losangeleskings,3bazi3,clambam11,2,Sat Jun 27 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"More on the gossipy side. I've seen people huffing about Lucic's issues with domestic violence [last thing we need if this is a recurring thing with him], has there been? I mean I perhaps haven't paid enough attention but I don't recall him ever being arrested or? Was it like a disturbance type of situation? Was this like a thing that happened a while ago and it is just used to hate on him?  Does he make a lot of stupid mistakes in general? Like botched passes or trying to do the hero thing and holding onto the puck when he really needed to pass, etc"
losangeleskings,3bazi3,nenright,3,Sat Jun 27 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"Point 1: There wasn't much out of that really. Not even in the same universe as the Voynov thing. No arrests, no charges (from what I remember.)  Point 2: He has a penchant for dumb penalties, mainly of the retaliation variety. Expect that when you play teams like Vancouver, Anaheim etc. You can just watch our games against the Canadiens as evidence."
losangeleskings,3bazi3,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:43:19 2015 UTC,"Hmmm good to know, especially with the first thing. It's been somewhat difficult considering Voynov.  Games against rivals will always be ugly, so it is expected though we have kind of been trying to work towards taking less penalties, it seems.  It will definitely be interesting to see if they try and condition that out of him though who knows if it will work or no.  Suppose our first game against the Canadiens will be interesting. I hate all of them except Price, for the most part- sooo."

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,OliverSmiff,8,Fri Jun 26 20:55:35 2015 UTC,Word is Boston retained almost half his salary.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Sniffman,9,Fri Jun 26 21:24:16 2015 UTC,13th pick and Colin Miller is overpayment. Not happy about this at all
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,LAKBurner,9,Fri Jun 26 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"The hockey draft is more show than substance. Lots of puffery over 1st, 2nd, 3rd round picks... DL's goal is 1 ½ NHL players out of every draft and not many first rounders pan out, so giving up 13 in this draft isn't that big of a deal. Especially after our minor league team just won the Calder Cup. We'll be ok."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,RubyRhod,2,Fri Jun 26 22:04:01 2015 UTC,2.75 mil retained.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Staffatwork,6,Fri Jun 26 21:43:13 2015 UTC,Oh great another over paid under performing producer to put on our 3rd line.  Lucic richards brown line. Good Job.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,LOUD__NOISES,9,Fri Jun 26 21:01:24 2015 UTC,He'll be on the 1st line without a doubt.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,banksy_,2,Fri Jun 26 21:11:28 2015 UTC,Came here to say exactly this. Wish he had more than a year left too.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,EricBurger,17,Fri Jun 26 20:58:54 2015 UTC,The Bruins retained close to half of Lucic's cap hit/salary in order to make trade work with the cap-strung Kings  Edit:Looking like 2.7m  **Edit: General Fanager Milan Lucic cap hit now $3.25M for LAK and $2.75M for BOS
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,LOUD__NOISES,12,Fri Jun 26 21:18:27 2015 UTC,Now that's more like it.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,MONSTERTACO,11,Fri Jun 26 21:18:57 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming this means he's replacing Williams on the first line? He's significantly younger, fits well with our style, and puts up almost as good stats. There's absolutely no way we were going to find anyone cheaper to fill this spot. If we extend him this is an awesome trade, if he moves on after 1 year it's an overpayment."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,wiseaus_stunt_double,5,Fri Jun 26 21:25:59 2015 UTC,"At the same time, he's the power forward we need on the top line since both Kopi and Gabo aren't that style of player that causes havoc along the boards and in front of the net.  I'm not too worried about next year since even if Lucic is a rental, we'll be able to use the free cap space to give Kopi a raise he'll probably be asking for."

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Staffatwork,43,Fri Jun 26 20:59:42 2015 UTC,I'd rather have the pick and jones back.

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Staffatwork,7,Fri Jun 26 21:09:33 2015 UTC,not even close to being the number 2.

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,PissOnEddieShore,3,Fri Jun 26 22:11:39 2015 UTC,If Colin Miller is the real deal that makes this trade very shitty.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,nickmakhno,2,Fri Jun 26 21:40:12 2015 UTC,"With Berube being waiver eligible, it was either Berube or Jones who had to go. And Berube is cheaper.   That pick is hard to let go."

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Wheezin_Ed,3,Fri Jun 26 21:39:16 2015 UTC,"Right there with you. We traded franchise defenseman Dougie Hamilton for dogshit.

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,RubeusShagrid,9,Fri Jun 26 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"Consensus here isn't that we didn't want him because of his production, just his cap hit.   Once Richards is bought out and Dean makes some cap saving moves, I think everyone will calm down about this a bit."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,BiohazardPixie,6,Fri Jun 26 21:03:47 2015 UTC,Take him back.

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,LAKBurner,4,Fri Jun 26 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we said the same thing about Gaborik too."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Sniffman,6,Fri Jun 26 22:43:20 2015 UTC,Gaborik trade was a steal. We didnt trade a 1st rounder. We traded Frattin and a 2nd plus a conditional 3rd
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,LAKBurner,2,Fri Jun 26 22:45:52 2015 UTC,"He turned out to be a steal. At the time, we were taking on a guy that might only be here a year and had a history of injuries. Same with Sekera. The fact that they might only be here a year doesn't mean we don't take them. A first round pick in hockey isn't as big a deal as it is in other sports. We were going to lose Jones or be forced to eat more cap space than we wanted. Miller wasn't going to make the team and we get Milan Lucic for half. I think it was a great move."

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,sonician,9,Fri Jun 26 21:49:48 2015 UTC,"Lucic is a bag of dicks, but now he's our bag of dicks. Jones was apparently holding out, and we didn't give up any of Zykov, Kempe, Shore, Weal or some others. Boston kept half the salary.   This leaves room to buy out Richards, and resign Sekera, who is already an NHL pro, over Colin. Overall, I like it. Draft picks are always hit and miss anyway."

We have good goalie prospects and Jones is an RFA. He made it clear he was going to try and get all he could and possibly drag it out. Putting him in the deal fixed that issue. With McNabb earning a spot and  Forbort being next in line to come up, Miller wouldn't have a spot or the ice time he deserves. Lastly, maybe the Kings weren't happy with the choices at 13.

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,LOUD__NOISES,4,Fri Jun 26 20:56:38 2015 UTC,"Richards will be bought out fur sure. This 100% guarantees it as management probably values Sekera over Lucic.  edit: Looks like BOS might eat some salary, per Lisa Dillman."

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,BW4LL,3,Fri Jun 26 21:18:53 2015 UTC,I'm stoked to have Lucic but we way overpaid for a guy with one year left.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,whatIsaRedditt,3,Fri Jun 26 21:01:42 2015 UTC,What exactly did we pay?
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,BW4LL,4,Fri Jun 26 21:09:06 2015 UTC,13th overall. Jones who is a starter and could fetch maybe a 2nd round this year or if he has another good year a first. Then Colin Miller who was our best D prospect.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,receptionlunch,2,Fri Jun 26 21:13:11 2015 UTC,The Miller part is what I really don't understand.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Staffatwork,2,Fri Jun 26 21:32:30 2015 UTC,this years 1st in what is the deepest draft in 10 years and a great right handed shop D man. and Jones.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,TheNickster,3,Fri Jun 26 21:13:27 2015 UTC,Miller AND Jones and our 1st? This is fucky. What I don't understand is where he's going to fit in. Is he going to be slotted in on the 1st line? Is he going on the 3rd line? I'm so confused about this trade.  At least /r/hockey seems to be taking this trade well.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,gambit700,3,Fri Jun 26 21:09:21 2015 UTC,That was quick
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,whatIsaRedditt,3,Fri Jun 26 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"Right? i just saw that, it hasn't even been announced officially yet"
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,EinsamWulf,3,Fri Jun 26 21:13:43 2015 UTC,The butt hurt over at /r/hockey is glorious right now.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,MagicArc,2,Fri Jun 26 21:32:11 2015 UTC,"oh man the saltyness is beautiful, i had to troll them just a little."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,arjun32,3,Fri Jun 26 22:21:09 2015 UTC,top six guy in his prime but only for one year
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,IgoRStripes,3,Fri Jun 26 21:49:09 2015 UTC,"Okay... where is Lucic going to be? !st line or 3rd line? That 70s line likely won't be broken up. And, Lucic isn't going to be a 4th liner. So where does he fit? When he has a solid center with him, he can be a 20+ goal scorer. When he doesn't... not so much. So first line makes sense, but he doesn't have the speed to keep up with Kopi and Gabo (Brown doesn't especially either, but at least it's closer).   I'm not entirely sure what this acquisition means... moreover, giving up the draft pick in one of the best draft years in quite some time, along with a solid backup... I just hope Lombardi knows what he's doing."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Aesth3tik,2,Fri Jun 26 23:22:11 2015 UTC,I would think with Kopi and Gaborik on the first line.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Bear_on_ice,3,Sat Jun 27 01:46:42 2015 UTC,"Well LA, you've become my second team. And who knows if the fire sale continues you might be 2 1/2. Are you accepting applications?"
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,alljake,2,Sat Jun 27 00:25:26 2015 UTC,"All are welcome on the bandwagon.  And with the alternating cup schedule, this is the PERFECT time to hop on board."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,ToastedFireBomb,3,Sat Jun 27 03:32:06 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of loving this trade, despite the hate. I know Jones was beloved, but honestly he wasn't gonna stay with us anyways. We have Quick, and Jones is talented enough that he should be a number 1 somewhere else, and probably want that kind of money. I'm fine with losing Jones if it means we get a power forward with goal-scoring ability, especially given our offensive struggles last year. Especially since Boston is retaining half the salary. Lucic might have a bad reputation, but fuck it, if he plays good hockey for us he can be the doucheyest douchecanoe on the planet for all I care. Have a little faith in Dean, guys, he hasn't steered us wrong yet."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Jericho111091,3,Sat Jun 27 00:54:20 2015 UTC,Knees will tremble in fear when our Literally Hitler line of  Lucic-Nolan-Brown   takes the ice
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Syben,6,Sat Jun 27 04:46:33 2015 UTC,What the fuck
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,CaptainH00die,5,Fri Jun 26 20:54:48 2015 UTC,God damn it. That's not what we needed.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Do_Whatever_You_Like,3,Fri Jun 26 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"as funny as this is to me, it honestly can't hurt to have him..."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,CaptainH00die,2,Fri Jun 26 21:38:10 2015 UTC,"Looking at the assets we gave up, I just know we could have gotten a sweeter deal."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,WarSucksLetsParty,5,Fri Jun 26 21:44:35 2015 UTC,"I live in Pittsburgh (for school, originally from LA) and there are a ton of Pens and Flyers fans (Flyers fans HAAAAATE him) on campus.  Lucic is the most hated player in the entire NHL in the East Coast because of how much of a ""douchebag"" and dirty player he is. I can't wait to rock his jersey ahahaha I love Lucic."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,nickmakhno,7,Fri Jun 26 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"I like the trade. Kings need some good LW players. Setting aside Lucic hate, we should love him. He has shown that he can score, he's passionate, he hits and he can fight. Fits right in on the Kings.   He's been stagnating/falling off of late, but maybe a change of scenery will turn it around. He's had experience playing with a guy like Kopitar (Bergeron), too.   It sucks to lose Jones, but with Berube being waiver eligible it was either/or and Berube is cheaper.   Losing the pick and Miller sucks, but if Lucic can come in and play well then I won't feel too bad about it.  The retained salary is great, as well. I feel it's a good gamble on Dean's part. Let's just hope Lucic can make an impact."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,blaiseisgood,4,Fri Jun 26 21:40:10 2015 UTC,Maybe now the rest of the league will like us again... ...
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,CrispyLardon,4,Fri Jun 26 21:00:55 2015 UTC,"Looch is big, strong and tough--I think he will be a good addition to our heavy, physical way of playing; it's just a matter of cost, though... Hope it's not too high. Do we know for sure what it was yet?"
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,RubyRhod,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:11:53 2015 UTC,"Miller, Jones, and the 1st. BOS retains 2.7 mil."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,CrispyLardon,2,Fri Jun 26 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"Could be worse. Jones is ready to move on since he won't ever replace Quick. Miller stings a bit, but we have McNugget and Forbort still. The first rounder hurts--but we were prepared to lose that if we made the playoffs anyway--so there has to still be a plan in place for that."

losangeleskings,3b8ixb,RayPinchiks,2,Fri Jun 26 21:36:16 2015 UTC,"So we already get shit as fans for Brown's dirty play. Now we'll have to hear it about Lucic, I'm sure, who has become a dirt bag the last couple of seasons. I hope get a third cup to collect all these tears. At least we'll have a solid fucking brawler on the team."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,tinkj916,3,Fri Jun 26 21:40:41 2015 UTC,How did you forget Quick Quick King of the Dirty Tricks off your list there?  :) Seriously.. we'll be the most hated team ever.  Even more than people hate the Pens and Caps.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,RubyRhod,2,Fri Jun 26 22:19:49 2015 UTC,"Per Rosen:   In 34 career games, Jones is 16-11-7 with a 1.99 goals-against average, a .923 save percentage and seven shutouts. He was due to become a restricted free agent on July 1; according to my contacts within hockey operations, negotiations did not exactly go expeditiously, which led to his name surfacing in trade talks.   So it seems like him hardballing in contract negotiations got him dealt."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,OverlordKopi_2037,2,Fri Jun 26 22:05:22 2015 UTC,"Oh man think about the Lucic-Kopitar-Gaborik line for a sec, he's a perfect fit. Sad to se Jones go, but hopefully he'll find a #1 spot somewhere(I think BOS might trade him away) Thanks for playing hard for us, Jonesy! Lucic, you're ours now, so welcome to the club, and bring the fucking thunder every night, bud!"
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,annoyinglyclever,2,Fri Jun 26 23:17:17 2015 UTC,Looch and Brownie on ice at the same time would be the most hated line in the league.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,humbuckermudgeon,2,Fri Jun 26 23:30:25 2015 UTC,"Oh...and with the way Sutter toys with lines, imagine for a moment a Brown, King, Lucic line. I'm giggling like a little girl."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,KingsfanMDJ,2,Sat Jun 27 01:31:45 2015 UTC,All you Lombardi haters. He's made one bad decision in the last 5 years and that decision was based off loyalty towards a player that was a key component in our first 2 cup runs. Have some fucking faith.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,LAKBurner,2,Sat Jun 27 03:01:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. Dean Lombardi is the Bowss...
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,TheEw0kGamer,6,Sat Jun 27 06:10:51 2015 UTC,"God fucking damn it Dean, you should have left things alone. Jones may have been already gone, but leave the fucking pick and Miller."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,heyitsEnricoPallazzo,4,Fri Jun 26 21:09:12 2015 UTC,"What's next, Doughty & Lewis for Bernie Madoff & an ingrown toenail!??  Ugh, I hope he leaves his bullshit back in Boston. We already have a liability asshole, and his name is Jordan Nolan. I don't want us to be the Oakland Raiders of the NHL"
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,CaptainH00die,4,Fri Jun 26 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate the Raiders, I think that comparison would be a compliment. That 80s team that won two Super Bowls was a physical powerhouse, assembled from some of the meanest and scariest players in the NFL. If Dean is trying to make us the most intimidating team on the ice, I have no problem with that."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,tinkj916,3,Fri Jun 26 21:58:23 2015 UTC,I like the way you think
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,Spade490,2,Fri Jun 26 22:20:46 2015 UTC,NOOO WHY???
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,toadman3,2,Fri Jun 26 21:00:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about the pick because everyone knows Dean does his best drafting in the 2nd round and not the 1st. Boston retains salary which is huge given the Kings cap situation. At the deadline a guy like Lucic would cost the 1st + Miller anyways(remember when we traded a 1st + Tebuert for Penner???), so by throwing in Jones we get him for the whole year. I think the only question is what version of Lucic we're getting and where he'll fit in the lineup."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,brizalmighty,2,Fri Jun 26 21:26:36 2015 UTC,Lucic is BOSS on the ice. my favorite bruin. congrats on getting him.
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,sungenie,2,Fri Jun 26 21:55:39 2015 UTC,"Wow. How am I supposed to hate Boston so much now? Remember to tell him not to nut check people.  I kinda feel sorry for you guys as I like your team a lot, but then again he is an asset. But, fuck...  Edit:  I approve this bullshit check because it was against Detroit."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,xray606,2,Fri Jun 26 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"I'm speechless. Is this a joke? If I had to pick one player that I would never want anywhere near my team, it would be that guy. I don't care what he brings, that guy is a POS. And they gave up Jones for that? Giant mistake. All he brings is dishonor, immaturity and disrespect. What the F did he do last year? Way less goals, less assists, less everything. Only thing he was good at, was acting like an asshole. They didn't do Jones any favors either, because he's just going to be a distant #2 again. Please let this be a revolving door trade. Please."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,brizalmighty,2,Sat Jun 27 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"you got the wrong image of Lucic. on the ice hes a mean dude but off the ice hes a very cool nice dude. hes one of the one bruins that mixes in with the media and fans in boston, sorta like big papi on the sox or devin mccourty on the pats, lucic was very well liked off the ice. hes the farthest thing from an asshole. hes dirty on the ice but now hes dirty for you, not against you. Lucic' A game is a thing of beauty, when hes steamrolling guys and scoring goals and skating fast you wont find another player in the nhl that compares."
losangeleskings,3b8ixb,xray606,2,Sat Jun 27 02:35:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry man, but... 'Mean' I have no problem with. Disgrace, I do have a problem with. I draw the line at deliberately slamming sticks into guys groins, and threatening people in the handshake line. Stuff like that has zero positive effect, and actually more likely has a negative effect. The way he acted when they were taken out two seasons ago, was an embarrassment to his whole team. Winning is great, but there's also other things, like honor. It's bad enough to be taken out of the playoffs. I don't need some goon making it even worse, by acting like a total psycho in the handshake line. And honestly... Knowing fans in Boston... If they liked him, that's just confirmation of why I shouldn't."

Send them our 2nd and 3rd round picks and maybe a couple prospects not named Weal Kempe or Zykov. Hopefully they keep some of his salary too which goes without saying unless we dump Martinez.  Please not Marty...
losangeleskings,3b9x6j,BW4LL,3,Sat Jun 27 04:52:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know..  The Kings traded away Jones, a 13th pick, and one of their top prospects for a rental player with a history of behavioral/attitude problems.  Oh and the rental is gone after a year so it feels like the Kings are trying to do what the Rangers did this past season; throw away a good chunk of their future for immediate success.  I understand that the Kings' system doesn't really nourish offense points but I would think they would have gone after a talented defenseman.."
losangeleskings,3b9x6j,LAKingBob,6,Sat Jun 27 05:53:05 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Sekera wants too much and I'd rather roll with the core we have than sign another contract that bites us in the ass. The going rate for a top 4 Dman is insane and I'd like to see some of the Manch kids get a shot anyways. Lucic on the other hand is Williams replacement. He's bigger stronger and younger and his production over the last couple years is better not to mention cheaper. He had a little bit of a down year since Boston had injury problems but I'm excited to see him play on the top line.  Save the money for Kopitar next year and if Lucic works out then we re-sign him.
losangeleskings,3b9x6j,BW4LL,3,Sat Jun 27 06:06:44 2015 UTC,"God, I'm so conflicted.  Wasn't it about a week or two ago, sources mentioned that Jones and Sekera contracts were close to completion and both were willing to stay in LA?  And then today happens; Jones is gone, Sekera is looking to be on his way out.    I wonder what's our defensive pairings are going to look like:  Muzzin - Doughty Martinez - McNabb  Greene - Forbort ?"
losangeleskings,3b9x6j,LAKingBob,2,Sat Jun 27 06:13:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's crazy how things can turn on a dime. I think your lines sound about right, maybe split up muzzin and doughty but that's another story. Then gotta think Shore and Weal join the team unless they're dealt. As well as JF Berube being the backup in net.  Detroit called up a lot of their Calder cup winning players same with Tampa Bay (triplets line) and I believe Ducks did as well. Cheap talent is how the Hawks stayed good after 2010 and we need some of that now badly."
losangeleskings,3b9x6j,BW4LL,3,Sat Jun 27 06:27:33 2015 UTC,"Good point about the the Hawks.  I'm just worried if things keep going the way they are, the Kings might not have the cap space or anymore new/cheap talent.."
losangeleskings,3b9x6j,LAKingBob,3,Sat Jun 27 06:31:29 2015 UTC,The modern NHL is a lot like the NFL in at least one way: teams need to get production from cheap young players on their rookie contracts if they want a chance to be great. Teams that draft well and have a strong developmental system have the greatest window of opportunity.

losangeleskings,3b9x6j,BW4LL,2,Sat Jun 27 06:50:36 2015 UTC,Williams and Stoll are UFAs. We could trade their rights but those are only worth a late round pick. It's usually traded so a team can have access to a player before July 1st to sign them. Doesn't mean much usually and isnt very useful.

We don't want that kind of attitude in the locker room. Might have even been a reason we traded him. Team stability is more important than point production in my eyes, and I feel not only DL, but the Kings organization feels that way."

losangeleskings,3b95fp,CrispyLardon,2,Sat Jun 27 04:00:52 2015 UTC,"We'll see how the season goes. I'm having a hard time trusting DL right now. Surely he won't steer us wrong for the fuck of it, but these trades feel like mistakes more than anything.  Traded big to get Sekera, can't re-sign him. Sure he helped us, but we kind of flopped so we would have been better off keeping our picks and prospects of course you can't know that before hand, but still.  Traded big to get Lucic, technically he is cheap, but he is UFA at the end of next year, he isn't going to sign with us- if he's even worth keeping, for under 4mil. Kopitar needs to be taken care of next season.  We're repeating the same mistakes and it makes me nervous. Not every trade will give us a Carter or Gaborik and everyone knows it but still.  Our cheap, talented players in the AHL are being shipped off.  Unless before the trade deadline next year DL uses the fact that everyone was after Lucic to capitalize on him the whole thing isn't something I can get on board with. IDC if they say Miller is difficult to coach, he still had 52 pts in 70 regular season games with 19 of those being goals. That is more than most of our forwards score, and even if there was a small cut in points when he bridged over to the NHL it is still a scoring defensive player.  There is no future team if you get into habit of getting rid of those kids unless you know for sure they will flip in the big game.  Everyone else is like OH GOD THIS IS TERRIFYING and GOOD FUCK THE KINGS EVEN MORE and I could care less about those things because I'm more worried that this move is going to be another one that actually fucks the Kings."
losangeleskings,3b95fp,musicraze,3,Sat Jun 27 01:48:26 2015 UTC,"How many of those cheap AHL players are truly ready for the NHL though? Someone made a comment about the last 10 13th pick in the NHL. one of them has seen the show. Unless you're getting too 5, it's your scouting that builds your developing players by grabbing what you feel is quality that can be molded. Throughout the organization, top to bottom, we play the same system. If Sutter were to retire tomorrow, Stothers could step in and do a decent job. Not saying as good, but he'd fit right in and do the damn thing. We also have McNabb. He was producing goals and assists before Sekera came over and did, honestly, jack shit as far as points production once he donned the black and silver."
losangeleskings,3b95fp,CrispyLardon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:01:58 2015 UTC,"I'm more concerned about Miller tbh than 13th. If it were higher up in the draft by a couple spots it would be one thing. But Miller probably could have stepped in within a year or two, or when it came down to it he could have stepped in for Greene when the time came if they felt he was a bit slow with things.   McNabb is doing fine and I think Forbort will rise to the occasion pretty well, and if we have to pull it out honestly McBain did fine with McNabb and together I don't really recall them making fatal mistakes. I always thought they paired nicely together.  My thought process isn't what if xyz retires tomorrow but I'm thinking just a few years along the road, baby steps, because that is how the players who make it into the Kings will do so as opposed to suddenly forming a new team.  We're a great defensive team, and if we can get our pieces to get better at the offense that is great as they are capable. But what I would like to do see like 3, 4, 5, 6 etc years from now is for us to run into a lot of the issues most other teams do in which they are seriously lacking in defensemen and also defensive prospects because they're all more interested in finding a bunch of like McDavid's in the rough you know?  At some point we're going to slide into a decline and there will probably be some kind of dread rebuild type thing- everyone talks about it you know the 'window' teams have for being successful, and I feel like our teams and trainers have a system that very well could continue to work as it has been, but we need to keep those players in that system and working on it when it is likely there will be spaces for them sooner than never.  Miller had a really good season and Jones has the potential to be a starter for someone IMO, but it is hard to be consistent while being a backup goalie when you're started is the sort of guy who would even play through  injury as long as he is able.  Trading them away isn't going to kill us, but then we also traded away picks for next year and a prospect. We've let go of guys like Vey although he never would have been huge for us and has completely buckled under the Canucks' system [or so it seemed].  So it's those sort of things, and thinking like you know god forbid we have another freak accident like has been happening seasons past. I'm overly cautious and like to have a backup plan, which is also why I'd obviously never fair well as a GM.  Obviously DL and the like know what they're doing and why way better than the fans do, but given that I don't just go 'awesome a player who should probably produce a lot for us!' I am rarely like thrilled at it happens, I need to see some kind of result before I can jump on board the hype train. It is a long way to pre-season sadly."

losangeleskings,3b95fp,INFGeoff,2,Sat Jun 27 00:31:35 2015 UTC,"Forbort. Dude is ready for the NHL. Only reason we went after Sekera was because we had options to make a late season push with Draft Picks and prospects, for someone with NHL experience. As long as we keep developing the talent that we have in Ontario and Manchester and not trade them away, we'll be just fine. We have set the standard of the minor league development and growth within a franchise. Edmonton tried it, And the NYI seem to be coming up through their drafts as well.   I'd also like to point out that Sekera is aging, and with the type of injury he suffered last year, I feel we're on the winning end due to the high chance of him being re-injured, and us having him under contract for the next couple of years. Thus being stuck with him.   With Voynov, his salary if now off the cap. To me that means either DL knows something we don't or, he's gone no matter what due to all the bullshit he's put us through.   Stoll, gone.   Williams. Unless he's willing to take a huge cut on his retirement contract, gone.   So how much cap space does that leave us with?  Lucic on for 3.25, Tofu on for I think 2.4 for this year. That leaves us I think roughly 2-3mil. Then we buy out Richards. That opens up another 3.6 for the next two years. That's looking ok to me to make more moves."

My big ""issue"" is that there's a lot of risk; if Lucic gets hurt then we've given away a piece of our franchise for someone that may not stick for the long haul.   Best case scenario, Miller flames out and Jones never cracks a starting lineup, Lucic scores 25+35 and we go deep in the playoffs and be a real threat to win another Cup.

And we can keep the kids on That 70s Line instead of bringing one of them up as a 1st line winger. Our Top 6 looks pretty sick, and easily the best in a long time.  I'm more than fine with giving up Jones for it. He was holding out for more money. While it's cool and all to have a back up goalie that ""could be a starter somewhere else,"" it's expensive as fuck and really not necessary. JF Berube should be ready to go this season as a back up. He won't be as good as Jones, but that's okay. Moving Miller kind of sucked. He will definitely be an NHLer one day, and of course he was a right hand shot.  I'm not so sure about this move defensively though. If this means we can't sign Sekera, then we have a pretty big hole on our Top 4.  Doughty - Muzzin  McNabb - Martinez  Greene - Forbort  I guess?  The issue is that McNabb and Martinez are both borderline Top 4 Dmen. As in they should be the weaker partner in the pairing. At least that's just my opinion. Not having Sekera, even though he's one player, really turns our D core from top in the league to just maybe above average."

losangeleskings,3b9tzk,LAKingBob,3,Sat Jun 27 04:14:51 2015 UTC,"After thinking about this move all day I think that, given our current predicament, this was an overall decent move. Lucic can produce and plays a heavy hitting style of hockey. The Western Conference is ever increasingly adopting the style of play that won us a our cups in 12/14. On top of that, the Pacific Conference teams are just getting better as the seasons go by. Here is what we gave up for Lucic:  1st Round Pick (13th): In a deep draft like this it hurts to give up. At 13 though picking out talent is super hit and miss. As someone stated in another thread, if you look at the previous 13th overall picks you will see that we are not really missing that much. Of course this isn't to say that we wouldn't have struck gold but it would still be very hit and miss.   Martin Jones: He wasn't destined to stay in LA for more than another year. Its the same issue that we had with Bernier a few years back. Its the downside to having a club that shits out talented goalies every couple years. Jones stated that if he was to re-sign with the Kings that he would want more money and it was implied that he would ""make it difficult"" for us. I don't blame him, he has earned a pay raise and a shot at being a number one. Both of our prospects with the Monarchs are very promising and Berube probably deserves a shot at a backup role.  Colin Miller: Probably the biggest piece we are losing in this. AHL All-Star, and winner of the fastest skater and hardest shot at the AHL All-Star skills competition. He had a breakout year with the Monarchs and might have been able to make the team this year. We have decent depth at D, so even though we are losing growing talent its not like we would have really been able to utilize it.  Overall I think we could have gotten more for what we gave up but we are a stronger team currently because of it. The only damage done is our prospect pool and its still very healthy. Lucic has one year left and with the Bruins keeping 50% of the salary we are getting a cheap 1st line wing."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,Syben,3,Sat Jun 27 06:02:29 2015 UTC,"but my nostalgia...    After reading all that it does make me feel better.  As /u/wiseaus_stunt_double mentioned, if Lucic ends up leaving, it'll make room for Kopitar's possible salary increase (if he can earn it)"
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,LAKingBob,2,Sat Jun 27 06:19:29 2015 UTC,"Yup, and I sure hope to god he earns it."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,Syben,2,Sat Jun 27 06:25:11 2015 UTC,"Just watching Kopitar's clips from the World Cup after this past season made me excited.  He looked really pissed or hyped.  Either way, it's going to be exciting :D"
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,LAKingBob,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:26:50 2015 UTC,"I hope management calling out our core and making it clear that they expect more from them does something. I think Brown got the message and I agree, Kopi looked great at Worlds.  edit: Also, I think Gabo stayed behind to train over the summer instead of going back home. I could be wrong though."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,wiseaus_stunt_double,5,Sat Jun 27 06:30:57 2015 UTC,"For me, I felt that it was an overpayment; Jones (a pretty capable backup, if not a starter on another team, a 13th pick in a deep draft, and Miller, a top prospect that helped the Kings' prospect team win their first Calder Cup.    Learning the Bruins would retain a little under Lucic's AAV helped but I would be more understanding if Richards went to Boston as well.  And Lucic is going to leave after a year so it feels like the Kings tossed a good chunk of their future for a rental decent player that has behavioral/attitude problems."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,LAKingBob,3,Sat Jun 27 05:47:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not bothered with the rental thing since his cap hit next season will go to core players looking for raises -- namely Kopitar. If he signs with us after next season, that would be great, but we won't lose too much since we have guys in the minors coming up that can eventually fill that role."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,wiseaus_stunt_double,3,Sat Jun 27 05:56:01 2015 UTC,"While I always knew Jones was going to spread his wings and be develop somewhere else, I didn't think he would be part of a trade for a rental.  I think that is what kinda bothers me most.  Darn it, if only Richards could have gone to Boston as well.  But you have a good point about core players looking for raises.  No wonder /u/Pen2Paper asked you to be his assistant GM.  All I got from him was a misspelling of my username.."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,LAKingBob,2,Sat Jun 27 06:03:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I really see Richards going to Toronto or Edmonton, as both of those teams need guys with leadership and knowing how to win. Of course, we'll have to package someone else into that deal (esp. If we get a high-priced contract back like Kessel) in order to make that deal work, but I really do see Richards getting traded.  Talk to P2P -- we could use some help in the brain trust."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,wiseaus_stunt_double,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:17:19 2015 UTC,"From what the rumors are, Toronto's return is more likely Phaneuf than anything.  Which doesn't make sense because Phaneuf has a bigger cap hit than Richards until 2022.  And after what happened today, I can't bare to see the Kings lose more prospects (especially Toffoli).    As much as I had fun leading LAK's User Swap with P2P and Enrico, I'm still a new hockey fan.  I feel I wouldn't be too much help.  Right now I'm just trying to absorb as much knowledge as I can and participating/lurking in the hockey subreddits.  But thank you for the offer though!"
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,LAKingBob,2,Sat Jun 27 06:25:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is a good way to grow in the sport as it forces you to learn more about players around the league and in the system that you normally wouldn't know about.  Even if you have bad ideas, bouncing it off of guys like P2P and I will accelerate your learning. So, like every drug dealer and Nike would say, ""Just do it.""  EDIT: Forgot to talk about Toronto and Phaneuf. Honestly, I would be fine with him since he's familiar with Sutter and Sutter already knows how to get the most out of Sloppy Seconds. Also, I don't really see Richards going to Toronto alone -- Martinez most likely will join him up there."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,wiseaus_stunt_double,2,Sat Jun 27 06:36:58 2015 UTC,"I knew you were going to use that argument!  Haha I'll do the best I can but no promises as I recently began an internship.  If it is Richards and Martinez going up for Phaneuf, I still don't think that's a good idea.  Sure we'll save about 2.75ish million in cap hit (Richards - 5.75, Martinez - 4 and Phaneuf - 7) but we're still going to be short a defenseman.  But then again, that money could be used to re-sign Sekera or someone else..  From what the rumors are going about, it seems like Toronto are adamant about getting one of the young forwards (Toffoli/Pearson)."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,Pen2Paper,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:33:46 2015 UTC,"Well, we went the buyout route; so, what do I know...  Good luck in your internship."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,LAKingBob,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:17:05 2015 UTC,"I don't see Lucic as a rental. He'll develop chemistry with the guys during camp and preseason. He'll likely have a set position on the 1st line all season long with possible rotations to the 3rd & 4th lines to mix it up and provide rest time throughout the season. I would slate him in for 22-25 goals, 30-38 assists. That's a solid piece right there."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,LA2SPQR,2,Sat Jun 27 06:23:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Sekera was looking like that the past few months until we got the bad news today..    And I might not personally know Lucic but I don't think he'll be willing to take a dramatic discount.  He didn't take one for the Bruins and he was pretty much the essence of that team."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,Sniffman,2,Sat Jun 27 06:29:26 2015 UTC,"I was skeptical when first hearing of the trade but reserved judgment. I want to thank /u/Syben for providing a well-reasoned argument and convincing me this was a good move.  But OP, I'm curious to know what makes you think we are ""probably winning the Cup next year because of this move""..."
losangeleskings,3b9tzk,anexanhume,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:52:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I had you as a Cup favourite before the Lucic deal, based on the effect of a rejuvenating summer on a group that would have easily made the playoffs last year and if not for Voynov. If the Richards and Voynov money is spent elsewhere to upgrade the D, I'd say you have a great shot at the Cup. Chicago will have to shed too many assets to win again."

losangeleskings,3b7a79,MagicArc,2,Fri Jun 26 16:50:54 2015 UTC,Kings have $63.2 million committed to 17 NHLers. Roughly $8.2M in cap space left. Would save extra $4.5M this year if they buy out Richards
losangeleskings,3b7a79,Zanchbot,4,Fri Jun 26 16:07:11 2015 UTC,"We save 4.54M if Richards is bought out. The full 5.75M if he is somehow traded. Sekera is rumored to be around 4.5M asking.  If Sekera signed with no movement on Richards, we would have 3.7M to add one defenseman, two forwards and a goalie. That comes out to 925K per player, which is very doable given we're talking about McBain/Schultz/Miller/Forbort, Andreoff/Shore/Weal and Berube if need be. Who knows what Jones will command if he stays. It's seeming like more than 1M at this point."

Currently we are thin on D, and according to Dean, this move keeps us from signing Sekera.  8, 2, 27, 6, 3 plus Forbort is not gonna win us a cup. I love Matt Greene, but if he's in your second pairing, you aren't even a playoff team.  So why give up a first rounder, a promising DEFENSIVE prospect and our backup goaltender for a guy with only a year left on his contract? We can't keep giving away 1st round picks for rentals and expect to continue the success.   I have faith that DL must have a plan for the hole in the defense, but as of right now, I hate this move."

Lackluster attitude last season... Temperamental... They're willing to take a major hit to make it work... and so on. You don't get something for nothing. Personally, I think he has a dinosaur mentality, and that's why he USED to fit into the Boston 'goon' mindset. Only problem... It doesn't work anymore. They tried that against Chicago and failed. Most teams that try it nowadays, fail. And I think Boston has also realized that. Word was that they told Marchand to tone down the BS the season before last, and his playing has actually improved. My theory is that they wanted to clean up the goon thing, and Lucic didn't fit in with that. I would like to think (and know) that L.A. is a bit more sophisticated than that, and thus... is more successful. My disliking him aside, I genuinely don't think he fits in."

And I get it, I want Sekera back too and will be really disappointed if we don't keep him. But some people are acting like he's the difference between a good defense and Edmonton. Without Sekera we have one hole in our d line up (no Voynov, please, regardless of how his trial ends up), and while it's a top 4 slot it's not like we're bereft of good defensemen.

To do this, we let go of our second oldest defenseman, who is coming off of a horrible knee injury and is asking for a lot of money. I think DL did a great job today."
losangeleskings,3b9c2o,LAKBurner,3,Sat Jun 27 01:27:18 2015 UTC,We also got a guy with a reputation and character issues.
losangeleskings,3b9c2o,lordjedediah,3,Sat Jun 27 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"I've read a number of places that DL and the staff place as much emphasis on character and locker room behavior as they do stats and play. So, when they pick someone or trade for someone, I am comfortable that they'll fit in. They do far more diligence than we do. I also think playing for Boston and living in Vancouver brings a host of issues for a hockey player that he won't have to deal with living in the South Bay. I'm excited he's a King and think DL did a great job today"
losangeleskings,3b9c2o,LAKBurner,2,Sat Jun 27 01:44:27 2015 UTC,Let's be frank though we have players that also the same could be said. We have to trust in the leadership of the team and management that things will work out. Lucic strikes me as a very passionate guy and that probably leads to some bonehead moves. I trust in our team to rectify they mistakes of the past and I think Lucic is happy for a fresh start as he's already alluded to in his interviews.

losangeleskings,3b9c2o,ToastedFireBomb,3,Sun Jun 28 17:01:07 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this is working into something bigger.  Like re-signing Sekera.   Although apparently Jones was playing hardball, so he got shipped out. Plus, Lucic for 3.25 isn't bad.  Now if we can dump someone for a pick and sign them for cheap / buy out Richards, we might have a chance of signing Sekera.   Unless I'm missing something here.   All in all, Lucic is a good fit. I'm okay with it."

losangeleskings,3b9c2o,nickmakhno,2,Sat Jun 27 04:10:56 2015 UTC,"Repost of myself from earlier thread    I like the trade. Kings need some good LW players. Setting aside Lucic hate, we should love him. He has shown that he can score, he's passionate, he hits and he can fight. Fits right in on the Kings.   He's been stagnating/falling off of late, but maybe a change of scenery will turn it around. He's had experience playing with a guy like Kopitar (Bergeron), too.   It sucks to lose Jones, but with Berube being waiver eligible it was either/or and Berube is cheaper.   Losing the pick and Miller sucks, but if Lucic can come in and play well then I won't feel too bad about it.  The retained salary is great, as well. I feel it's a good gamble on Dean's part. Let's just hope Lucic can make an impact."

It's a big gamble as there's a lot to lose, especially since we're going to have to spend $9m +\- on Kopitar and if we go anywhere in the playoffs this year every one up for contract (Kopie and Lucic included) is due for a raise."

This just shows you really aren't a fan of the team itself and you'll look for any excuse to abandon ship, so if you were to jump onto another teams bandwagon and anything goes wrong you'll quickly go elsewhere again.

We'll have some interesting weeks ahead with trying to make the cap work and all that and come out with a playable team.   Plus the Voynov controversy has been entertaining to follow.

losangeleskings,3b7zed,BW4LL,0,Fri Jun 26 18:39:45 2015 UTC,If I could choose two players who are expendable at this point in time to the Kings it would be Clifford and Martinez (Forgive me father for I have sinned.)
losangeleskings,3b7zed,lordjedediah,6,Fri Jun 26 19:00:10 2015 UTC,"Whattttttt?????? I felt like Cliffy stepped it up like crazy last season. I also didn't see any reason to think Marty is lacking--I think he did pretty good all things considered: his injuries and our D being all haywire all of last season. Cliffy shouldn't cost too much either, and besides, who else is gonna fight for our boys on the ice? He plays well and fights well--I think we need him a lot."
losangeleskings,3b7zed,CrispyLardon,2,Fri Jun 26 19:51:05 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it's about making room for players coming up. Martinez' is a 5-6 defenseman. Miller, Forbort and McNabb are all going to be fighting for a position and they are much cheaper than Martinez (who admittedly could've gotten more in free agency).  Clifford is a role player and while he is a fan favorite, he's replaceable on the ice. I'm not sure how it would effect the locker room but Clifford isn't part of the Kings core nor part of the prospect group."
losangeleskings,3b7zed,lordjedediah,2,Fri Jun 26 19:56:10 2015 UTC,"Martinez would be our #2 puck-moving d-man (we haven't signed Sekera yet and who the hell knows what will happen to Voynov), no way you move that guy."
losangeleskings,3b7zed,PissOnEddieShore,2,Fri Jun 26 20:00:46 2015 UTC,Clifford is for sure part of the core. He's never played a single game in the AHL and he stepped it up a lot last season. Plus he signed a very team friendly deal.
losangeleskings,3b7zed,leftylogan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"I think Clifford is becoming part of the core, honestly. Last season Sutter and Dean always had good things to say about him stepping it up--and it showed on the ice. He isn't flashy by any stretch, but he gets things done. I am all for McNugget getting more ice time--I love him. I don't know what's up with the McBain situation but he definitely needs to go. And I can see what you mean about Forbort and Miller--they are exciting propositions for sure; I just don't think we should give up a veteran for them; especially when our D has gaps the size of the Grand Canyon right now."

losangeleskings,3b342j,EricBurger,6,Thu Jun 25 18:13:49 2015 UTC,This is probably what should have happened. Felony charges seemed like a bit much for what he actually did.
losangeleskings,3b342j,r0botdevil,4,Thu Jun 25 18:40:52 2015 UTC,from what I read this is a standard deal given to 1st time offenders in the state of Nevada.

I think the fact that it was such a high-profile case was the reason for the felony charges in the first place.

Williams needs to take a discount, but it will come down to whether or not he really wants to play in LA or see what he can get money wise around the league.  Still plenty of game in stick."
losangeleskings,3b342j,MagicArc,5,Thu Jun 25 16:38:00 2015 UTC,"Williams is very similar to Mitchell in that I think we're going to miss him when he's gone and we don't really have a replacement (I also think they will both end up in Florida but on different teams...).   Stoll, on the other hand, has had diminishing production and a diminishing role on the team. Shore is knocking at the door and is pushing Stoll out.  The Kings will be looking for a Williams replacement but they already have our Stoll replacement."
losangeleskings,3b342j,parineum,3,Thu Jun 25 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"Stoll will not be a King next season I can almost guarantee it. He's getting older, his production is lacking, he takes dumb penalties, he'll demand too much salary, and THEN there's the drug issue. It's not gonna happen.

Of course this is all speculation and more likely you fine gentlemen are correct and we've seen the last of Stoll.  If i'm not correct I believe 10 had a coke issue as well.  Didn't someone put some snow on their blade and offer it to him once?    I would much rather them save that cap space for Stick but I know he can go make a ton of money elsewhere. =("

Doughty has two Olympic golds, two Stanley Cup wins. Kopi has those two Cup wins as well as leading his country to their first ever Olympics. That means a lot more to them than any NHL Award or Video Game cover ever could.  Sure Toews has three Cups and two golds plus two game covers, but he plays for a bigger hockey market with more fans, in an offensive role on an attack based team. (Not entirely fair to the Hawks considering they got the Norris last year).  If you're EA who do you put on the cover? The most recent Cup winning captain and his offensive sidekick who are some of the most recognisable names in hockey, on one of the most popular teams recently. It's just business.  I'm not mad, I'm winning the Cup with the Kings on NHL 14 every week until the new season, then I'm watching them eliminate Chicago again before taking their third Cup."

losangeleskings,3b0e0t,kiwirish,7,Thu Jun 25 01:58:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not even mad. I was more mad last year when Doughty played out of his skin and lost. Drew played far better last year and wasn't even nomimated.  This year he was good but wasn't as good as 2014 due to the Kings having about 30,000 injuries all at similar times plus losing Slava and Willie. His time was last year but the NHL glossed over one of the top 3 defensemen in the league.  Kopi didn't deserve the Selke bid this year either, down year all round unfortunately. I don't really care for the awards anyway, I'd prefer the Cup.  It's just a shame because it genuinely is the only thing kept from Drew's trophy case. He's what, 24 (25?) and has two Olympic Golds, two Stanley Cups, multiple Norris nominations. The Norris would just act as a solidifier to get him a place in the HoF whenever he retires.  Please play for 20 seasons Drew."
losangeleskings,3b0e0t,Zanchbot,5,Thu Jun 25 00:11:54 2015 UTC,"See I think Doughty WAS just as good this year, and that his lower point totals are kind of misleading. It's easy to forget that for large chunks of this season he was being weighed down by Regehr as his defensive partner. It's tough to score goals when you're constantly covering for someone 10 years older and with half the speed, which is what Doughty spent a lot of this season doing.   The good news is he's still young, not even in his prime yet as defensemen go. The thought of Doughty actually being even better than he currently is fills me with excitement for the future. He'll almost certainly win a Norris or two yet, just thought maybe this would be his year."

losangeleskings,3b090w,LOUD__NOISES,2,Wed Jun 24 22:56:38 2015 UTC,"It's all contractual. If the NHL suspends him, the Kings have no reason to. The injury he sustained gave the Kings a reason to."

losangeleskings,3b090w,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:46:00 2015 UTC,theres a chance that he couldn't get suspended for being accused of beating his wife (not arguing he didn't do it but legally its an accusation at this point) but usually injuring yourself outside of normal hockey activities is against contracts
losangeleskings,3azve3,crazyolmaurice,11,Wed Jun 24 21:01:42 2015 UTC,If Richards is part of the deal I don't hate the idea of it.
losangeleskings,3azve3,_Taengoo_,2,Wed Jun 24 21:42:20 2015 UTC,That's the only way it makes sense. Too many goalies on the market right now to get a good return.
losangeleskings,3azve3,DreamcastWriter,2,Wed Jun 24 22:52:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. I love Jones, but like others have said, he won't overtake Quick for a while unless some horrible injury occurs or Quick somehow pulls a Mike and starts to suck all of a sudden. So he's basically just sitting on the bench, we would trade him at some point this season most likely anyway. If we can package him with Richards and get this god awful noose off of our necks, I think it makes a lot of sense."

He won't start the 2016/2017 season as a King. Its the way of backup goalies. He's not going to over throw Quick so he will be traded whenever the time is right.

losangeleskings,3aucq5,anexanhume,13,Tue Jun 23 16:06:31 2015 UTC,"Assuming Voynov's salary is gone and Richards is bought out (1.21M cap hit), that leaves $15,052,273 to sign Toffoli, Jones, Sekera, Williams, Shore, Weal, Andreoff, and McBain (note: not all those players need make the roster)  Here's a quick example:  Sekera: 5M  Toffoli: 3M  Jones: 1M  Shore: 800K  Weal: 700K  Andreoff: 700K  McBain: 600K  Total: 11.8M out of 15.052M.

losangeleskings,3aucq5,RubyRhod,2,Wed Jun 24 05:30:17 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think we sign Sekera. I don't think it's possible with Kopi's contract. I don't think he's going to get Kane/Toews numbers but he's getting a raise. Last season he just didn't put up the numbers. We'll see what happens this year.   I think we try hard on Mike Reilly and then also bring up Colin Miller at the start of the year.
losangeleskings,3aucq5,seabass4507,2,Tue Jun 23 23:24:24 2015 UTC,"We have every indication that the Kings want Sekera back and that Sekera wants to be back. Doughty said today he thought they would have made the playoffs if Sekera hadn't been injured and Doughty wants him to return. Gaborik is a fellow Slovak and they are good buddies. He's a good team fit.  Competition for 7D spot will be tough. McBain could be back. You've got Schultz with 1 year left on his deal. Miller could contend for it, and throwing Reilly in the mix would make it very complicated."
losangeleskings,3aucq5,seabass4507,2,Tue Jun 23 23:47:18 2015 UTC,I think Forbort will be in the mix as well. He's been pretty solid in Manch.

losangeleskings,3aucq5,nenright,3,Tue Jun 23 19:49:32 2015 UTC,"I think the writing is on the wall for a buyout of Richards. It's the safest option for the team at this point.  I also think the team has to proceed with the idea that Voynov will not be off the cap until he's actually off the cap.   So in that case, you need to to account for his $4.2M cap hold still. It sucks, but better to assume the worst after the hell the team got put through last year around this.  That would mean about 11M to re-sign Toffoli, Sekera, Jones, Williams, Shore, Weal, Andreoff and McBain.  If you assume a $5M deal for Sekera, and somewhere around $3M for Toffoli, that leaves $3M total for the rest. So goodbye Williams for sure. Jones will be cheap, Shore and Weal will be cheap. You would need to let go of Andreoff and McBain in this scenario.   McBain played well last year, but is expendable because of the depth on D in the minors, and the fact you've re-signed Sekera. Andreoff was never going to be more than a 4th liner and isn't a big loss.   And if Voynov is pulled from the books sometime next year, you've got the ability to really make a big splash in the trade market."
losangeleskings,3aucq5,Zanchbot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:57:31 2015 UTC,That's solid thinking right there. Keep the core intact and position the team to make a move later down the line.

losangeleskings,3az843,nickmakhno,0,Wed Jun 24 18:16:19 2015 UTC,Kings still keep a cap hit if they buy him out. they don't if he is taken in the expansion draft.
losangeleskings,3az843,GaboKopiBrown,7,Wed Jun 24 18:18:45 2015 UTC,I'm not expressing an opinion here. This is being reported by LA media that this is what Dean is going to do. He's either going to be traded or bought out (unless something majorly changes) before next season.  But what I know for sure is that expanding is not a quick process. The Kings can't hold onto his entire contract for two or three seasons waiting for the expansion draft and hope he's picked up. They have a lot of players to resign and keeping Richards for years would limit or prevent that.
losangeleskings,3az843,RubeusShagrid,0,Wed Jun 24 18:23:11 2015 UTC,"Please link to those sources, mayorsmanor, lakingsinser or latimes has no quote of Dean saying that.   here is the closest I could find:    But don’t expect Richards back next year. He’s likely to be moved, either through a trade (which doesn’t appear to be materializing at this point), or via buy-out   Today the NHL is announced they are moving forward with Expansion process. The arena is projected to be ready for the 16/17 season.   Richards buy out cap hit is     2015-16: 1.22M 2016-17: 1.72M 2017-18: 2.72M 2018-19: 4.22M 2019-20: 4.22M 2020-21: 1.47M 2021-22: 1.47M 2022-23: 1.47M 2023-24: 1.47M  2024-25: 1.47M     Save millions buy eating a shitty contract for one year or carrying that cap hit for the next 10 years."
losangeleskings,3az843,nickmakhno,2,Wed Jun 24 18:36:35 2015 UTC,"The problem is eating the shitty year occurs during our rapidly closing window with the current talent. The buyout's worst years can be during a semi rebuilding period which can culminate in re-signings as the Richards buyout lessens and brown presumably is signed for significantly lower.  Your scenario suggests the expansion draft will definitely happen next year and they will definitely pick up Richards.  Two or three years on the full contact could cost us a cup. Theoretically, so could the buyout. I think the former is more probable."

They both have inside sources and I trust their word.   I'm not going to armchair GM here and argue numbers or who I would trade him to if I were dean. I'm running off the facts available at the moment, and they currently say he's not going to be sticking around that long.   We can't sign all the players we need to sign if we hold his contract for two or three seasons. It's simply not possible."
losangeleskings,3az843,Syben,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:49:51 2015 UTC,everyone has been reporting of it. Dean has only said that was an option. But even Jon Rosen has posted about how its likely.
losangeleskings,3az843,pbjamm,2,Wed Jun 24 20:11:11 2015 UTC,an expansion draft wouldn't happen for a number of years still... we're between 2-4 years away from it right now
losangeleskings,3az843,LOUD__NOISES,2,Wed Jun 24 18:59:24 2015 UTC,Yeah but that's less of a cap hit than if he stayed in the minors. The bottom line is the Kings need money to lock people up now. Keeping him wouldn't allow them to do that and the expansion draft is at minimum a year away and it's not a guarantee he gets taken.

losangeleskings,3az843,kiwirish,2,Wed Jun 24 19:31:14 2015 UTC,It's happening.
losangeleskings,3az843,lordjedediah,2,Wed Jun 24 22:18:24 2015 UTC,You assume someone would take him via expansion draft.
losangeleskings,3az843,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:41:25 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't they? Proven leader, Cup winner, captain experienced but not that old, just needs a spark to get back to NHL calibre.  Mike Richards is a good player, just not worth paying $5M to sit on the fourth line."
losangeleskings,3az843,kiwirish,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:24:24 2015 UTC,Where do you think he would be on a team in 2 years? Probably still on the 4th line.
losangeleskings,3az843,CaptainSpectacular79,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:44:59 2015 UTC,But not making 5M while doing so. If we had him for like 3M we probably wouldn't be trying so hard to get rid of him.
losangeleskings,3az843,kiwirish,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:49:29 2015 UTC,Expansion team? Probably a Top 6 forward and an A on his chest.
losangeleskings,3az843,CaptainSpectacular79,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:08:01 2015 UTC,"Same reason nobody claimed him off waivers, maybe."
losangeleskings,3az843,kiwirish,2,Wed Jun 24 23:46:02 2015 UTC,"Big difference there. Last season everyone thought the cap was going to stay where it was, so no team was going to risk it by taking on a big contract.  An expansion team that needs to get to the cap floor and wants a leader, then Richards is exactly the contract they want."
losangeleskings,3az843,Pen2Paper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:49:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Still quite a gamble. It'll be two seasons before expansion, I don't know the risk warrants it. Especially if cap can jump a little to absorb the buyout penalty with expansion revenue."
losangeleskings,3az843,Pen2Paper,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:01:14 2015 UTC,"I meant that he'd be picked up in expansion, just probably as a free agent. If the draft was this year then sure, but now with the Voynov money off the cap and Dean wanting to get rid of Richards, it's time to buy him out and extend our Cup window.  The cap might still rise a fair amount in the next few years and not bite us too badly in the ass. But I'll take two years of rebuilding to get a third Cup."

losangeleskings,3auyl3,dalbtraps,2,Tue Jun 23 18:41:41 2015 UTC,Cheers. I've been looking for a site like this since capgeek went down.
losangeleskings,3atu2u,humbuckermudgeon,21,Tue Jun 23 13:36:20 2015 UTC,I love Mike Richards. I hate that a couple of concussions (from hits that weren't punished) essentially cost him career.   I also believe that the Kings won that trade no matter what happens with Richards. Two cups in 4 years and an incentive for Carter to want to come to LA are worth the money that Richards will be getting from the Kings.
losangeleskings,3atu2u,lordjedediah,10,Tue Jun 23 16:21:48 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. I don't think we win either Cup without Richards. He changed the mentality in LA.
losangeleskings,3atu2u,dalbtraps,3,Tue Jun 23 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"outstanding leader and a great competitor. still love that mike richards ""the shift"" video. im hoping we take konecny and he can be like richards in that sense. i heard he played in the ohl playoffs through a broken collarbone/shoulder as a 17 year old."

losangeleskings,3atu2u,EinsamWulf,3,Tue Jun 23 18:00:43 2015 UTC,He's not going to retire. Other teams know the spot the Kings are in so they are just waiting for us to buy him out then they can sign him to a lower cap hit contract. If they had picked him up off waivers they would've had to pay his ridiculous salary which is really why he's not still in the NHL.

losangeleskings,3atu2u,bryan_sensei,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:58:00 2015 UTC,I was referring to the decline in play. He isn't the same guy he was when we got him and it sucks to see it. The fact that he was such a huge part of our first cup and last year got sent down to Manchester is just depressing. I was running around the house cheering when we grabbed him from Philly. Maybe its just harder on me because I'm really a really big fan of his.
losangeleskings,3atu2u,KingsfanMDJ,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:27:09 2015 UTC,It's going to be interesting to see if the long offseason helps Richards bounce back. My guess is that he will be ready to help a team when the puck drops next season.

Absolutely love his competitiveness and leadership, and he's great on offense and willing to do the dirty work.

losangeleskings,3aqtxa,lordjedediah,30,Mon Jun 22 20:03:35 2015 UTC,they probably needed to go to vegas to blow off steam. a lot of teams do this after the season ends. I don't see it as an issue.

losangeleskings,3aqtxa,thegetawayplan9,-1,Mon Jun 22 21:03:20 2015 UTC,Yes they can. Cops can search your person and any unlocked container when you're in public.
losangeleskings,3aqtxa,jinqsi,5,Tue Jun 23 00:05:55 2015 UTC,yes but thats not the situation at hand. He wasn't searched by the cops. He was searched by security who then called the cops. He should've told the security no and walked away. He was in his right to do that.
losangeleskings,3aqtxa,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:56:20 2015 UTC,Well they can ask to search you. They can't search you just because.
losangeleskings,3aqtxa,FoostersG,0,Tue Jun 23 04:18:22 2015 UTC,"From legal zoom:   Stop and frisk has been an effective tool for police since the 1968 case Terry v. Ohio, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of it. The court agreed with the police that officers face uncertain and dangerous situations on the streets—circumstances that can potentially threaten both law enforcement officers and the public. For this reason, police officers need a set of flexible responses that allow them to react based on the information they possess. Thus, distinctions should be made between a stop and an arrest (or seizure of a person), and between a frisk and a search.  Under the Terry ruling, a police officer may stop and detain a person based on reasonable suspicion. And, if the police reasonably suspect the person is armed and dangerous, they may also frisk him or her for weapons.  What exactly is Reasonable Suspicion?   Reasonable suspicion is defined by a set of factual circumstances that would lead a reasonable police officer to believe criminal activity is occurring. This is different from the probable cause (what a reasonable person would believe) required for an arrest, search, and seizure. If the stop and frisk gives rise to probable cause to believe the detainee has committed a crime, then the police officer should have the power to make a formal arrest and conduct a search of the person."

So he wracked up more penalty minutes than almost everyone else on our team, and scored almost the same amount of points as a guy who got sent back to the AHL, and a guy who broke his leg and couldn't play.

Whether it's his fault or not, he hasn't rewarded Dean's loyalty, and has put us in a tough position. Stoll got arrested with a not insignificant amount of drugs on him after the team had one of the most disappointing seasons in all of sports last year. As a veteran guy on the team, he fucked up big time. On top of that he's been a PIM liability and hasn't produced for shit.

losangeleskings,3aq461,FHlogin,24,Mon Jun 22 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"he is our captain because he leads by example both on and off the ice. When everyone else on the team seems to have no energy, he's always there to motivate him via a big hit or a big goal. Need a big goal? Big hit? Big play? Dustin Brown has delivered time and time again. Remember game 7 of the 2014 western conference finals? Kings down 2-0 with about 4 minutes to go in the first, Chicago with all the momentum, dustin brown throws the puck on net and carter batted in the rebound. then again in the third, down one goal, he assisted on the game tying goal. game 2 of the stanley cup finals he scored the game winning overtime goal on a sweet deflection.  The point is, even though he may not put up as many points as crosby or tavares or even toews, he comes through when we need him to and he is a tremendous leader in the locker room."
losangeleskings,3aq461,nenright,6,Mon Jun 22 16:46:50 2015 UTC,Yeah this is the right answer. Sometimes being the captain doesn't mean being the best player or the player with the better stats. It's whoever is the leader in the locker room and who can set an example of work ethic.
losangeleskings,3aq461,howdoesone,3,Mon Jun 22 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"Agreeing as well.   I feel like Brown really turned it around the most too, from showing up late and leaving as soon as he could to truly being a part of the team and there to be the first to motivate the guys especially on the ice when Mic'd up happens. I feel like the change in Brown kind of marked the turning point for the Kings and the team we have now in a big way, too.  They learned what it means to be a team, and they took the ability to lean on and pressure each other and have been very successful with it.  I also don't see why it would be an issue at all that a team wouldn't pick their highest scoring guy to lead. Sure it doesn't seem to hurt most teams, but there isn't a rule and Brown handles it fine."
losangeleskings,3aq461,BiohazardPixie,3,Mon Jun 22 17:13:21 2015 UTC,The point is hes a great captain but no team in this league can justify paying a 3rd line right winger $7.25 Mil with a cap hit of $5.8. If he was still a top 6 this wouldnt be a discussion but with the cap issues we already have ie. richards and voynov we may be forced to get rid of him for the betterment of the team.
losangeleskings,3aq461,Schreibdaddy,3,Mon Jun 22 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"richards is gone, hopefully voynov will be resolved before the season. brown is also apparently working his ass off this summer, so before we go and deal our captain, lets wait and see if he has a bounce back year. also, im fairly certain he'll be on the top line with kopitar and gaborik."

losangeleskings,3aq461,nenright,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:39:39 2015 UTC,I'm not saying your wrong my question is to you if no buy out there is no team as of now that wants him. So buy out is the only option that's why all the articles are saying he's gone no matter what. I would rather have a trade then a buy out and from what I've ready dean is thinking the same way
losangeleskings,3aq461,Schreibdaddy,2,Mon Jun 22 20:08:08 2015 UTC,I believe that dean will look for trade offers until the last day of the buyout window and if no deal can be made he will buy out Richards.
losangeleskings,3aq461,nenright,3,Mon Jun 22 21:30:31 2015 UTC,Game 6 of 2012 SCF: Brown scored/assisted on 2 goals while on the PP (Bernier major). That was HUGE.
losangeleskings,3aq461,bryan_sensei,3,Mon Jun 22 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"I think OP was clear enough that intangibles aren't his concern - there's no one here disputing that Brown is a proven leader and is invaluable in that aspect of his game. I read OP's question as more of a performance concern; his scoring and defense fancy stats are way down over the past 2 seasons. Though I don't have the stats on-hand to prove it, I think we've seen this kind of tailing off from Brown before. The last notable time was in the spring of 2012 before the deadline when rumors leaked about him being shopped... I don't think we need to belabor that point, but OP seems to be saying it would be nice to have a captain who contributes in tangible ways and I admit it gets really frustrating for me as well. He seems to have one move with the puck, and I think the whole league has it figured out. So yeah, when he's in epic meltdown mode he can make magic happen, but his day to day playing style is frustrating as hell to watch. That said, I think we've got the right captain; I just wish he could figure out a better deke and start putting up some more points."
losangeleskings,3aq461,toogaloon,3,Mon Jun 22 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"ah, okay. yeah, i see what you're saying. i'm hoping that this rest will give him time to come back in great shape and be more effective next year."
losangeleskings,3aq461,nenright,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"I think the point i was trying to make here, though i didnt make it obvious, it that it's hard to lead by example when you.. well.. really aren't putting up the numbers to back it up. From what i saw over last season, there were more influential players on the ice than him.  While yes, there is more to the ""C"" than points, but, scoring a goal in a tight game is more influential than talking to your team in the locke room. It's disheartening to see the Captain say one thing but do another (if that makes sense?) Im not bashing him, but maybe we DO need to demote him to an ""A"" for one season. we seemed to do it to Mike Richards when he was struggling, so why not do it to Brown? (though i know not every situation is the same) Just and idea. You can be just as influential as an assistant than a captain, and maybe the demotion is the motivation he needs."

losangeleskings,3aq461,lordjedediah,22,Thu Jun 25 18:10:37 2015 UTC,No one on the Kings really puts up the numbers that most of the NHL teams do. The Kings are the definition of a win by committee team.  I highly recommend watching the Kings 2014 Stanley Cup DVD. Brown is the captain for a reason.
losangeleskings,3aq461,Ji-der,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:51:57 2015 UTC,Would absolutely love to watch that and the 2012 DVD. DVD regions are a pain in the ass and I've had no luck pirating it.
losangeleskings,3aq461,wiseaus_stunt_double,7,Tue Jun 23 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"Brownie plays a physical, checking game.  While his hit total is down a bit, he still had 246 hits and was 14th in the league last season.  Only once in his career has Brown gotten over 30 goals, and four other times has he gone over 20.  He still is playing his game."
losangeleskings,3aq461,anexanhume,6,Mon Jun 22 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"Brown is still one of the best guys in the NHL at drawing penalties (and penalty differential).  He didn't have a consistent line position last year and no one can be blamed for lack of offense for being stuck on Stoll's back all year.  +/- is meaningless, but his shot rate going down is a concern. Part of that could come from playing with Stoll.  He falls down a lot and holds onto the puck too long sometimes. Not sure if needs to be working on agility drills or he's just asking his body to do things it can't anymore in terms of footwork. Holding the puck too long can easily be remedied through coaching or playing with Kopi who deserves the puck all the time.  Brown's commitment to fitness is second to none on the team. He worked his ass off last pre-season and is doing it again this year. He's setting a good example as a captain in that way, but as a 5.8M forward, I think he needs another 20 goal season to justify his salary."
losangeleskings,3aq461,Caped_Crusader1,6,Mon Jun 22 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"I think you're comparing it to a few teams with big known names. Ovi, Crosby, Stamkos are all top scores, if not the 3 top scorers and point producers in the league and they all wear the ""C"". But not every team's captain is their biggest offensive weapon. Chara from the Bruins is a D-Man so obviously doesn't score a lot but is a leader on the ice. Panthers choose Mitchell to wear the ""C"" since he has won a championship and is a veteran that could help lead the team in the right direction. Sharks took it away from Thornton I believe because for one, he was slacking in points, but during our game 7 in the first round when the Kings completed the reverse sweep, he didn't show up. He looked defeated and it trickled down the rest of the team. In a situation like that, letting a 3-0 series lead wind up to a game 7 is mentally tough and any team would feel a tremendous amount of pressure. Yet I'm confident had it been us in that situation Brown would've been vocal in the locker room to assure the team to get it together and win the game. And he would've given it all he had the entire game to keep our boys energized. That's why he's our captain and why I love him."

losangeleskings,3aq461,kiwirish,3,Mon Jun 22 19:14:59 2015 UTC,"Brown epitomises what the Kings are, gritty, hard hitting, defensive minded, physical and able to handle the grind. He is a great captain for us in more ways than just numbers.  To me Kopi doesn't want the addition of captaincy, he leads by scoring and being a playmaker in his own right. The way he plays doesn't look like that of a captain, more so that of a player who wants to do their job well without the dramas of captaincy.  Carter would probably make a good captain, as would Doughty. But Brown isn't broken, he's still our captain and quite clearly the boys still have faith and trust in him. He's led us to two Cups, three WCFs and by far the most successful Kings years in history. Say we miss the playoffs again next year and it might be time in reinvigorate the team with a new Captain."
losangeleskings,3aq461,LOUD__NOISES,2,Mon Jun 22 23:58:40 2015 UTC,"His offensive production has been on a huge decline. He used to post pretty solid numbers. Now his numbers suck. He does need to improve them, absolutely.  But he will remain the C because he embodies the LAK work ethic and style of hockey. He's a leader who's lead the team (whether on the ice or off). He will never not be the C."
losangeleskings,3aq461,dalbtraps,2,Mon Jun 22 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"Aside from this season look what he's accomplished?  2014-Got his team to the cup 2013-Conference Finals 2012-Cup It'll take more than just one bad season (where the Kings still only missed the playoffs by 1 win) to make a case for replacing his ""C""."
losangeleskings,3aq461,dowdle651,2,Tue Jun 23 00:07:51 2015 UTC,"This is coming from an unbiased non kings fan. You may be right on his skill drop off, but I don't know what it is, I love me some dusty. Maybe its because my facial hair grows in the same way, I dunno, but regardless. I do think he has the leadership skills though."
losangeleskings,3aq461,KingsfanMDJ,2,Tue Jun 23 10:17:59 2015 UTC,With Pearson back and William's probably signing somewhere else he'll get some time with Kopi and Gaborik. I'm withholding any judgement on his play until I see him on a line that is expected to produce a lot of points.
losangeleskings,3aq461,LAKBurner,2,Tue Jun 23 15:27:18 2015 UTC,"Leadership has nothing to do with points or scoring. The C is because he's the leader, it doesn't mean he's the best or scores the most. We wouldn't have won two cups without his leadership. He was picked over Toews and Getzlaf for the Messier award last year and don't forget he was named an alternate captain for the US Olympic team. He embodies the role of a leader."
losangeleskings,3aq461,knappz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:45:41 2015 UTC,only stat I care about is SC rings. he's captained the last 2 of the past 4 SC champion teams ...come cryin' when 2 fur 6 or 2 fur 8. IMO he's the second best captain in the league and the identity of LA Kings hockey.
losangeleskings,3aq461,TRSTNSPR1990,-4,Wed Jun 24 03:08:03 2015 UTC,"To be honest the 2nd half of last season I thought Kopitar should have the ""C""..."

losangeleskings,3ak8ss,GaboKopiBrown,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:58:47 2015 UTC,I'm a firm believer that Brown should be on the top line. You need someone to do the dirty work on that line. All season we fiddle and then come playoffs Brown always ends up playing on that line. He needs competent players to be effective and sticking him on the third line isn't helping his game. Hes not gonna be a target when Kopitar and Gaborik are on and it frees him up to get quality looks and be on the ice with actual playmakers. Instead of being the focal point with 2 competent bums.  Go back and watch game 7 against Chicago and tell me Brown can't be great when playing with actual talent.
losangeleskings,3ak8ss,BW4LL,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:54:17 2015 UTC,"Well, even on that line his numbers haven't been great.   As for the playoffs, he needs to show up in the regular season if we want to get there.   He can play great, but he needs to be more consistent across the board, plain and simple. If he isn't getting it done then he's not going to be on that line."

That 'something' is not Toffoli or Pearson for the record. Maybe it's a pick, maybe it's Forbort.  Dion just needs to get away from Toronto- he's nowhere near as bad as he's made out to be. His presence would replace Voynov- he would be a fantastic second pairing D guy."

losangeleskings,3aet5s,nenright,2,Fri Jun 19 16:50:53 2015 UTC,Exactly. He costs more than Drew.
losangeleskings,3aet5s,Plamadude30k,5,Sat Jun 20 00:36:09 2015 UTC,And he also ISNT the best defenseman in the league.
losangeleskings,3aet5s,nenright,3,Sat Jun 20 00:39:48 2015 UTC,"Kings add Martinez. You get a solid 2/3d dman, Kings get money to sign Sekera and have Miller/Forbort/Gravel fight it out for the third pairing spot. Trading away Richards will hurt because the Kings will have to add a solid asset, and Martinez makes the most sense to me."
losangeleskings,3aet5s,seemonkey,2,Fri Jun 19 20:22:14 2015 UTC,They just signed him to a deal. They're not going to trade away their second offensive defenseman either. If anything it would be a Monarch going going with Richards.
losangeleskings,3aet5s,clambam11,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:13:12 2015 UTC,I've seen his name as well as Muzzin thrown around several places if the Kings were to sign Reilly.

losangeleskings,3aet5s,BiohazardPixie,3,Sat Jun 20 01:07:04 2015 UTC,"Kings are in their championship ""window."" If the cap comes at or above 71M, it's possible they could keep Jones, Toffoli, Sekera AND Williams if they can shed the entirety of Richards' contract.  That may be worth losing a near NHL prospect like Zykov, for example, or giving up a high round draft pick. Toronto doesn't factor into a salary dump scenario most likely, though."
losangeleskings,3aet5s,anexanhume,4,Fri Jun 19 20:40:09 2015 UTC,Kings wont move any young good assets in just a cap dump. This teams window is open and trading away a pearson just to get cap room to sign another pearson doesn't make sense.

Winning the Calder Cup shows LA has some great prospects Toronto would like. I think that's more valuable to them right now.
losangeleskings,3aet5s,illogicalillusion,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:15:40 2015 UTC,"A prospect may have to go along, but in order for the Kings to take on that $8Mil AAV that comes with Kessel, they'd probably have to send someone else with a fairly healthy contract as well.  Either that, or we're gonna have to ask Toronto to keep more than $2Mil in cap space on their books.  When you think about it, the real reason why we're looking to trade Richards is to get out from under his cap hit -- without another contract or Toronto keeping a significant portion of Kessel's contract, a Richards/Kessel trade puts us in a worse bind esp. if you consider all the players that need to be signed (there's no way in Hell we'll be able to re-sign Kopitar next season if we dealt for Kessel).  Otherwise, we'd be better off just taking the $1.5Mil-$2Mil if we go for the buyout of Richards' contract, and a straight deal of Kessel for Richards favors Toronto assuming they still want to send Kessel packing."
losangeleskings,3aet5s,wiseaus_stunt_double,3,Tue Jun 23 07:11:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's no secret that in addition to Richards; Stoll and Voynov are also unlikely to return next year (Voynov is anyones guess really but I don't see him making a return).  Williams is another veteran player that is probably not going to return and I would say that if the Leafs are looking at a veteran player then Justin Williams is probably who you guys would want. Not only can he be a leader in the locker room, we've seen he can get it done on the ice where as Richards seems to struggle with keeping his skates under him at speed.  Honestly I would personally want to at the very least off load Richards and Stoll and I suppose it would be a question of what LA would get in return. I'd personally try and keep Williams on LA's roster but the Cap situation being what it is, trading all 3 of those players might give us the room to ensure we can re-sign Sekera.  I'm not familiar with the Leafs roster so I really wouldn't know who to even ask for in the trade."
losangeleskings,3aet5s,EinsamWulf,6,Fri Jun 19 15:33:22 2015 UTC,"Stoll and Williams are both UFA's, so if the leafs want Williams the leafs can just sign him."

losangeleskings,3aet5s,BW4LL,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:44:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to catch flak for this, but the only way I see the Kings moving Richards will be in a salary-dumping swap. I can picture in my head Dean calling up Hextall and talking Richards for Vinny, but I don't see that really working for either club. We saw this kind of trade at the deadline with Clarkson and Horton (and their awful contracts), but it's still pretty early to see how that will look for either club long term.  The wildcard here will always be that Dean and Richards go way back to Richie's pre-NHL days in Philly. Combine that with the undisputed fact that LA doesn't win the cup in 2012 without Richards, and it makes a business decision that much harder. Honestly, he's got a record as a great leader, but his X-factor days may be well behind him since even demotion to the minors last year didn't shake him up and get him contributing in any tangible way.  I think by the end of training camp we'll see if he's been able to get his life oriented to playing at an elite level in the NHL, or if he'll be riding out his contract in the AHL. Those seem to be the only real options for the Kings, and it makes me sad."
losangeleskings,3aet5s,toogaloon,5,Fri Jun 19 16:51:35 2015 UTC,The reason the Clarkson for Horton deal happened for NO SALARY RETAINED is because the Horton contract was uninsured. CBJ was paying out of pocket for him and for a team that doesn't have the revenue to pay for that. Toronto makes a shit ton of money so it wasn't a big deal and they got Clarkson off of the payroll and CBJ got a player they don't lose money on
losangeleskings,3aet5s,leftylogan,5,Fri Jun 19 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"In my mind we've given Mike every chance to get it right over two seasons and he just hasn't stepped up to the plate. I hope to god that Dean does the right thing and gets rid of him, even if that means a buy out. Agreed we don't win in 2012 without Richards, but he had a huge hand in us not making the playoffs this year too. Him and his stupid contract and his lack of performance. He was dead weight when we couldn't afford any more dead weight."

losangeleskings,3adtjt,the-garden-gnome,6,Fri Jun 19 09:08:59 2015 UTC,It would be a pretty tough decision if you had to choose Doughty or Carter.
losangeleskings,3adtjt,KobeBasedGod24,10,Fri Jun 19 09:28:24 2015 UTC,"I think it would be tough to not begin moving Doughty into the direction of captaincy. I think your franchise defenseman who controls the ice for half the game deserves to be in that position. Historically, that has been the case with other successful teams.   See: Chara, Lidstrom"
losangeleskings,3adtjt,Borrum,9,Fri Jun 19 15:20:21 2015 UTC,"I remain concerned about his maturity, though he seemed to have gotten his temper more under control last season."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,GaboKopiBrown,5,Fri Jun 19 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"If he can turn that immaturity and chirpiness into firing up his team and enthusiasm for the game, we are in great shape."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,Borrum,3,Fri Jun 19 18:56:30 2015 UTC,It is certainly an extension of his passion for the game. He just needs to channel it in a positive manner instead of a negative one.
losangeleskings,3adtjt,GaboKopiBrown,4,Fri Jun 19 23:19:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He acts very impulsively sometimes and gets the team into hot water because of it. I don't think he's mature enough to begin going down that road yet. Hope he can get there, but he's a loud mouth baby. He's talented as hell, but he's a loud mouth baby."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,doot_doot,2,Fri Jun 19 20:10:30 2015 UTC,"I think it would be tough to not begin moving Doughty into the direction of captaincy.   And that is exactly what the A is for, right? I'd be ok with Doughty wearing it. We can talk about him wearing the C in 3-4 years."

losangeleskings,3adtjt,nenright,7,Sat Jun 20 00:38:53 2015 UTC,EVERYONE: They're not hinting at Carter getting the A. This game was against Detroit early in the season when Kopitar was injured. Carter wears the A when either Greene or Kopitar are not playing.
losangeleskings,3adtjt,nenright,3,Fri Jun 19 16:46:10 2015 UTC,I understand he's worn it before. He also wore it during the split squad games. But it's still fun to speculate
losangeleskings,3adtjt,dalbtraps,5,Fri Jun 19 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"man, hockey offseason sucks. but its okay! only 5 more days until we get to watch doughty and kopitar win a combined 0 awards!!"
losangeleskings,3adtjt,nenright,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:16:39 2015 UTC,DD will get the Norris I think. Kopi get's the shaft again since Toews is apparently the 2nd coming.

And with regards to kopitar, even though I think he's a better player than toews, kopitar doesn't deserve the selke this year. I think he might get lady byng, all though maybe datsyuk gets it for like the 4 millionth time."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,Staffatwork,2,Tue Jun 23 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"I know he's worn it before, but it seems like a peculiar image to use as the official cover photo. Thoughts? Am I reading too much into this?"

losangeleskings,3adtjt,thegetawayplan9,2,Fri Jun 19 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"It's interesting because even though his production has declined, how could you pull the C from Brown after he's led you to 2 Cups?  The 'core' of this team for the next 5 years, assuming he is re-signed, is Anze/Drew/Carter/Quick... and to the point below, I think you need to recognize your franchise D man in some way."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,CrispyLardon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:15:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know that the cups make as much of a difference... as the fact that taking it away from one guy and giving it to another, is almost a guaranteed cluster F in morale. Which is why teams usually trade the guy away. I'll probably get voted to the basement, but... I personally think it's a big issue. I like the guy, but look at him, and look at the other top captains. It's not just about goals... It's about personality, speaking in public, morale... Everything."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,nenright,2,Sat Jun 20 08:01:39 2015 UTC,This was posted by their marketing team who has little or no knowledge of these kinds of front office moves.
losangeleskings,3adtjt,CrispyLardon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I don't see Kopi losing the A, and I don't see Greener losing it while he is on the team--he is one of our leaders for sure; it's one of his biggest assets and reasons we keep him around."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,nenright,2,Fri Jun 19 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"Is it one of those things were carter is the third A, where he only wears it when one of the two assistants isn't playing?"
losangeleskings,3adtjt,CrispyLardon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:52:10 2015 UTC,"I am not sure about that, actually, but rotating A's has been done before--I just don't see the upside in that. And I guess if the unthinkable happened (Brownie getting traded or losing the C) it would free it up for Kopi and then an A for Sexual Carter."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,doot_doot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"you think they'd give kopitar the C? i think they'd give it to doughty. he seems to be more outspoken and he's our best player IMO. I just heard about the third A because ESPN posted a photo of Sharp, Keith, Seabrook, and Toews next to all of the trophies they won this year and when someone asked why Seabrook was there, someone replied that he wears the A when sharp or Keith aren't playing. So maybe Carter has that similar situation as well."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,nenright,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:43:20 2015 UTC,I think Doughty is next in line for an A for sure. But I don't think he is ready to be a Captain just yet--but I think he will be eventually.
losangeleskings,3adtjt,doot_doot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"Not a chance. The Captain needs to be a strong leader for the team on and off the ice. Doughty is a young party boy off the ice, and on the ice he's amazing but kind of an idiot sometimes and definitely gets real chirpy and acts out. The Captain needs to keep cool, lead by example, and be respectable off the ice and in the room. Doughty's not any of those things, unfortunately. He may be one of our best players, maybe our #1, but that doesn't mean he's fit to be captain."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,nenright,-1,Fri Jun 19 20:13:54 2015 UTC,I've never heard of doughty described as a young party boy. i disagree with you 100%
losangeleskings,3adtjt,doot_doot,2,Fri Jun 19 20:17:26 2015 UTC,"I mean... it's not exactly a national secret. He parties pretty hard. I'm not taking a swing at him, I love Doughty. I'm just saying he's, currently, not captain material. Especially not above a guy like Anze.   What part of what I said above do you disagree with, though?"
losangeleskings,3adtjt,nenright,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"You said he's too chirpy. I don't think that's a bad thing at all. A lot of guys chirp. You also said he doesn't lead by example. I disagree with that too, seeing as how over the past few years he's taken on a bigger role on the defensive side of things and has basically taught muzzin and mcnabb how to play solid defense.i guess I understand your point about him Not being as calm as you'd probably like from your captain, though that's just because he's incredibly passionate about the game. He can fix that, though(toews apparently used to be a bit of a hot head as well, but he isn't any longer)."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,nenright,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:34:43 2015 UTC,"I said he didn't lead by example off the ice. And as far as him being a hot head it has caused him to take bad penalties as well as try to carry the puck all by himself. Works out sometimes, but also has lead to counter attacks that result in goals. On ice talent does not equal captain material. Like I said, I love Doughty. He's amazing. But the captaincy is more than hockey talent. It's the player who talks to the refs, the guy checking up on players when they have personal issues off the ice, the guy who leads the team when the coach can't. That's not Doughty. Not yet, anyway."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,CrispyLardon,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:15:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought you meant lead by example on the ice. Like I said, I never knew he was a big party guy, but I guess that probably means he doesn't set the best example off the ice. I see your point. I think he'll get there before brown ever leaves, though."
losangeleskings,3adtjt,Staffatwork,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:25:57 2015 UTC,"oh, yeah, so as it turns out this is that game they played the red wings early in the season when kopi was out. so yeah, i guess carter is the third A"

losangeleskings,3a8nk2,nenright,6,Thu Jun 18 05:09:42 2015 UTC,"Over 5 million a year and doesn't get points. That's why. It's not his fault, it's just not his role. Points=recognition. Defense/toughness=Stanley Cups"

losangeleskings,3a8nk2,seemonkey,7,Thu Jun 18 07:18:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's more of a grinder. You need someone to get in front of the net to block the goalie's view, Brown will do it. You need to get under the team's skin. Brown will deliver a solid hit to annoy them. He's not a very good hockey player type Captain, he's more of a motivational style Captain whose very vocal to get his team going."

I don't see how Toews is way above him and every other captain. He's just the flavor of the month. If the Hawks finished where the Kings did, I don't think anyone would be fawning over him right now."

We wouldn't have won two cups without his leadership. He was picked over Toews and Getzlaf for the Messier award last year and don't forget he was named an alternate captain for the US Olympic team.

losangeleskings,3a4cit,NashuaRedditors,2,Wed Jun 17 03:17:41 2015 UTC,I've asked the front office and they said this banner will stay in Manchester. They also told the local news (WMUR) and the Verizon wireless arena that this banner will stay in Manchester. Maybe Ontario will raise their own but this one was for the fans in New Hampshire.
losangeleskings,3a4cit,Destillat,2,Wed Jun 17 19:41:12 2015 UTC,"I'm totally okay with that. Technically they still have a Monarchs team and those fans all supported what we're going to know as the Reign during their run, they deserve to have a banner in their building as much as the new Reign do.  It would be cool if the Reign raised their own though."
losangeleskings,3a4cit,chimpanzeebutt,2,Wed Jun 17 20:58:22 2015 UTC,I wonder if this banner follows them to Ontario?
losangeleskings,3a4cit,Destillat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:50:34 2015 UTC,"Literally just came here to ask that. It's suppose to be the team itself moving, which I would imagine mean the current Reign take their stuff to Manchester and vice versa"

losangeleskings,3a1zzf,snackadj,4,Wed Jun 17 02:48:19 2015 UTC,"If the deal doesn't include another bonafide #1 goalie, a top 5 pick, a prospect, and a top 6 player while also including Richards on the Kings end, I'm not interested.   Obviously I'm overvaluing Quick but too many people are quick to forget 2006-2007 when the Kings played 5 goalies in one season. When you have a goalie than can get make you a threat anytime you're in the playoffs you hold on to them until they retire."
losangeleskings,3a1zzf,lordjedediah,-1,Wed Jun 17 17:07:07 2015 UTC,Starting 5 different average goalies in a season is very similar to starting Quick every night.
losangeleskings,3a1zzf,MervynChippington,7,Wed Jun 17 19:56:10 2015 UTC,"I have no patience for people who don't remember the past. You want to put this past season on Quick, go for it. You're dead wrong though."
losangeleskings,3a1zzf,lordjedediah,-2,Wed Jun 17 21:34:56 2015 UTC,"I absolutely don't want to blame Quick. Who said anything about that?  The team was great this year, with some Regehr and Richards shaped holes in the team.  The Kings would've made the playoff if not for shootouts. I have no criticisms of Quick aside from how overpaid he is."
losangeleskings,3a1zzf,MervynChippington,5,Wed Jun 17 23:18:05 2015 UTC,But he isn't overpaid. He is paid perfectly for the kind of player he is and he took a discount.    Henrik Lundqvist Sergei Bobrovsky Tuukka Rask Pekka Rinne Carey Price Cam Ward Ryan Miller Corey Crawford Cory Schneider Ben Bishop Semyon Varlamov Kari Lehtonen   All of those goaltenders have a higher cap hit then Quick.
losangeleskings,3a1zzf,lordjedediah,-3,Wed Jun 17 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"He's seriously not even in the same breath as some of those guys.  That list includes some truly top-tier goalies, which he is clearly not. If you're saying he's worth more, and he should be paid like Lundqvist or Rask or Price, you're not looking at the numbers"
losangeleskings,3a1zzf,MervynChippington,2,Thu Jun 18 01:23:23 2015 UTC,Sounds like you're only looking at the numbers. What have those three goalies accomplished?

losangeleskings,3a2uib,nessman930,3,Wed Jun 17 00:57:48 2015 UTC,"The only problem with a deal like this is that he has an $8mil AAV that goes until 2022.  Since we're looking to trade Richards due to cap concerns, I don't see us making this deal unless Toronto took on some of that contract."

Otherwise, if we make that trade without Toronto taking on at least 25% of it, that's more years going to one player instead of using that cap space to devote to all the players we'll need to give raises to the next few offseasons.

losangeleskings,3a2uib,humbuckermudgeon,2,Tue Jun 16 23:59:39 2015 UTC,i think Deano is going to want to keep forbort. i've heard he may be on the kings roster next season.
losangeleskings,3a2uib,nenright,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"I kind of think our best bet will be buying him out. Nobody will take Richards and draft picks, and honestly we're getting to a point in which we're going to NEED our prospects so I'm really uncomfortable at this point to just keep handing them out.  There are going to be holes we need to fill and I do think a few of our kids could transition if we need them to, them being closer now in Ontario is going to help. With our cap issues we need to channel Detroit and pull from what we have instead of looking to bring more people in from the outside.  Like... at this point I wouldn't even want to trade for Kessel or too many of the other names floating around because he won't be ready to take pennies and the Leafs won't just absorb a great deal of his contract. There aren't really guys hitting FA that I'd want us to leap for either honestly, get Sekera and Toffoli signed, Jones as well and then look at the kids."

Detroit should've beaten Dallas, Dallas should've beaten Green Bay, GB should've beaten Seattle and Seattle damn well should've beaten New England.  Whether it was a bad ref call, an unlikely play or the worst playcall in league history, the NFC losers were brutalized.  I'd go with Blackhawk Down myself."

Enjoy your parity.   I'm not salty. I really think in terms of Kings performance next year, this is going to inspire our boys more than anything. Two cup wins will be overshadowed by the Hawks ""Dynasty"" in the history books. But if we can do 3 in 5...now who's the best team of the modern era?"

Richards with his concussion, Quick with his back, Brown with his shoulder, etc. Ducks almost eliminated the Hawks by constantly wearing them out by out hitting them and making scoring chances by taking guys out of the play. Basically our playoff game plan that has proven successful. Just that we do it better while the Ducks suck. Hopefully after a long summer of rest we can get back into the playoff picture and prove we are still championship material."

losangeleskings,39zzeb,Pen2Paper,8,Tue Jun 16 03:50:43 2015 UTC,This right here.  The Blackhawks kept their game strong during the season and somehow stepped it another notch during the playoffs.  Although I didn't see a lot (if any) hate from Kingsfans but I could be wrong!

A Nashville teamed riddled with injuries, a Minnesota team whose outrageous luck finally collapsed on them, or the Mighty a Ducks of anywhere but game 7 at home?  I'm not taking away the win. I wish the Kings could have an easy path to the cup every year but once again the Western Conference Finals were the Stanley Cup and the path to victory there wasn't that hard."
losangeleskings,39zzeb,lordjedediah,2,Tue Jun 16 14:50:29 2015 UTC,"Come on, Anaheim and Tampa definitely both had a shot at the Cup. Not every round is going to be a challenge. When the Kings finish first in the division then we'll get some easier opponents in the early rounds."
losangeleskings,39zzeb,CaptainH00die,5,Tue Jun 16 15:14:02 2015 UTC,If Anaheim had felt an ounce of pressure prior to the WCF they would have choked it out. The Ducks not making the SCF after the first two rounds they had is a Sharks level choke job.  Tampa Bay had a chance.

I was looking at the Chicago sub this morning, and wow... I have never seen so many hate filled, angry comments, in my life. It made me embarrassed to be from there.

ECHL Monarchs taking the reigns from Ontario who barely came up short in the Kelly Cup playoffs. AHL Reign continuing the Monarchs' great run this year for the Calder Cup.

losangeleskings,39b8no,CrispyLardon,3,Wed Jun 10 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"It's not a true Kings game unless the words ""god dammit Muzzin"" are uttered by every single fan at least once.  With that said he is a great player especially when he has a good partner. Personally I think him and Doughty need to be separated as a pairing. I really like Doughty playing with McNabb and I can't remember if Muzzin has played with Sekera but that might be interesting to watch if Sekera comes back next season."

Did I forget to turn the locking ring on my e-cig when I left home? No way. Shit. It's getting hot fast.    I pulled over to the left of the carpool lane as quickly as I could, pulled off one of my gloves just as fast and pulled my mod out of my pocket. All of the cotton has burned away and the coils are red hot.It burned a hole in the side of my pocket. Can't tell from the outside, though, just in the pocket material. The denim on the outside looks fine and I wasn't burned on the inside due to the layer of kevlar between the pocket and my thigh.    Another rider saw me pulled over and came up behind me, but I gave him the thumbs up to show I'm OK and he took off. That brotherhood.    Anyway, that was my ride to work this morning."

Few guys are as cool-headed and controlled as the steady Slovenian, so to witness him lose his temper was a pretty revealing glimpse into the team's frustration level.""   Seeing Kopi like that was the saddest part of the season for me--heartrending. Well, that and Richy and Slava; all three of these things were depressing."

Despite all of the problems that this team is going to have to overcome, I still believe that it is one of the strongest, tightest teams in the league. Is it fall yet?"
losangeleskings,3970hi,hobonia,9,Tue Jun 9 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"This was a really good read. Kinda long but it never lost me. I'm definitely dreading July 1st a bit because I know we probably can't bring everyone back but I wouldn't be surprised if some of our guys took a cut to stay here, even after missing the playoffs. It just seems to me like this team has such a strong bond, all the allusions to being a family that we hear all the time only strengthen that.  Honestly I've sorta been taking a bit of a break from hockey since now is probably the best time for that after all the time I spent watching over the last three years with how much this team has played.  That said October can't come fast enough and I absolutely cannot wait to see what a well-rested Kings team looks like out on the ice."
losangeleskings,3970hi,anexanhume,2,Tue Jun 9 20:27:28 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the cap won't be announced until right before the deadline, so they could well agree to deals with Toffoli, Jones, Sekera, or Williams but have to sit on the contract until they've confirmed the numbers work out.   We also don't know if they're going to try and move Richards before that day or buy him out. For the former, they'd need to decide how much salary they'd be willing to retain. It's a lot of moving pieces."
losangeleskings,3970hi,hobonia,2,Tue Jun 9 20:43:40 2015 UTC,"I think that's where the silver lining of the team missing the playoffs appears.  I'm sure that negotiations are being figured out as we speak. Imagine what it would be like if we had to come into this situation after another deep playoff run.  As I said, I know we most likely won't be bringing everyone back but I'm hopeful. Toffoli, Williams, Jones, and an extension for Kopi are the top priorities."
losangeleskings,3970hi,WoozleWuzzle,7,Tue Jun 9 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"This was a really long article, but well worth the read.  Dustin Brown... This is why Kings fans support our captain. He not only says the right things, he says them in ways that's not bullshit.   I can't wait for next season. I hope some of these shadows over the team will be resolved. I have faith in Dean."
losangeleskings,3970hi,EinsamWulf,2,Tue Jun 9 20:45:06 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see LA come out swinging next season. In some ways I'm more excited for next season than I was last season, probably because it already feels like it's been forever since I've watched a Kings game but I also expect the team to really come out stronger than we've seen in awhile."
losangeleskings,3970hi,dalbtraps,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:55:09 2015 UTC,I honestly feel if we could've fixed either the Richie and/or Voynov issue earlier in the year it wouldn't have felt so doom and gloom in the locker room. Then once Pearson went down everything really hit the fan.
losangeleskings,3970hi,anexanhume,3,Tue Jun 9 22:45:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting about the run-in in the hotel lobby of Blake with Kopitar and Williams. You could see how annoyed Williams was after the final game too when Kopi tried to be light-hearted.  Voynov's injury was supposedly sustained playing tennis, so them being able to suspend him for that is key if they want to retain Sekera."
losangeleskings,3970hi,krucz36,4,Tue Jun 9 19:33:41 2015 UTC,"What do we do if Slava is cleared of all charges?   Let's assume we only get an official explanation and he's acquitted. Based on what I've heard and seen I can never root for that guy again. What does the team do?   They mentioned Alec and his wife talking about if ""something like that"" happened to them...do they mean if Alec hit and strangled her and gashed her head on a TV stand, or do they mean if they had an accidental injury during an argument like Voynov and his wife contend?   Again, I'm not condoning or suggesting anything, I'm genuinely puzzled as to where they can go from here if he's cleared of wrongdoing and goes free. I can't imagine the NHLPA would hesitate to try and remove his suspension immediately. They'd lose all credibility otherwise, after all, he is technically an innocent man. So a trade? Release?"
losangeleskings,3970hi,BiohazardPixie,2,Tue Jun 9 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"The way the CBA is worded, the league doesn't need Voynov to be convicted to be suspended. Any action detrimental to the league is enough for Bettman to suspend a player. Of course, there would be a lawsuit if they tried to suspend or ban Voynov from playing after an acquittal.   I'd imagine that the Kings, Voynov and the NHL will come to a mutual termination of the contract with potentially being treated as a compliance buyout. Then again, I wouldn't be surprised if the NHL made the Kings keep some of his cap hit because why not?"
losangeleskings,3970hi,krucz36,2,Tue Jun 9 20:38:36 2015 UTC,"Your tone [read: word choice] says plenty but this is a tiring subject to try and getting people to think about as anything black and white, just keep in mind this isn't like the NHL man who was caught on tape is a pointless battle. We don't have pictures despite claims of gruesome sights, I'd like to see pictures because one side claims horrific evil that sounds like intent to murder with so so much blood loss and so many stitches and the other side claims an accident that wasn't so bad. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle.  By the sound of it, at least some of his teammates believe it was an accident and they know him personally, take that with a grain of salt.  Anyway.  I'd imagine depending on the verdict we have options. If he's guilty he's gone, if he's innocent I imagine we will have the option to try and trade or release him. If he's innocent I am not actually confident they will cut him lose... we've already seen it.  Lombardi has a lot of loyalty to his guys, I think our organization is going to try and do everything they can to try and help him.  Even if he is cleared say next month, I'm not sure I actually believe we'll see him on the ice in October.  I also wouldn't be surprised at all if the league itself decides his fate similar to how they decided to suspend him."

losangeleskings,3970hi,wayneunser,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:53:48 2015 UTC,imo if he's acquitted we keep him on the team. Acquitted means acquitted if the prosecutor can't prove guilt than maybe he's not? We're never gonna get an exact account of what happened unless Marta changes her tune and decides to testify. If he's acquitted everyone will just start to sweep this shit under the rug like the whole Semyon Varlamov debacle.

I imagine they would probably require him to attend some kind of anger management counseling, but that the Kings would keep him. There's no team in the league he could be traded to that wouldn't have the same issues with the gamut of fan reactions."

AHL playoffs are still pretty exciting.  You all should catch the game on Wednesday and Friday! Go Monarchs. I can't wait for them to be the Ontario Reign.

losangeleskings,38ue66,dariusdetiger,3,Sun Jun 7 01:03:12 2015 UTC,"As a Wings fan living in Manchester. I've never seen the arena this full.  That's nice I guess.  Also, get ready to see some crazy dirty plays from Utica.  Watched the Griffins series with them and they were getting away with pure murder.  We'll see if the refs will keep letting them do that this series."
losangeleskings,38ue66,dariusdetiger,2,Sun Jun 7 00:17:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah there have been a lot of things so far I'm not really liking. Half the time they're not calling anything, and then they're calling everything. They took Shultz out in the first by running him against the boards, or so it looked like.  Slashed Millers stick right out of his hands, nothing.  Markstrom [sp?] kicked the net off when the puck was lose because it seemed like he couldn't catch it.  I AM SO UNHAPPY. NOTHING CALLED."
losangeleskings,38ue66,scratchy_cigarilloes,2,Sun Jun 7 00:20:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they rarely ever call delay-of-game for intentionally knocking the net off unless it's 100% obvious in real-time that it was intentional.  I'm actually hoping this series goes 7 games and I can manage to snag a ticket on the 17th.  As it is, I'm broke as hell until my next paycheck which IS the 17th.  While I'm a die-hard wings fan, it would be a fun experience to be there for the Monarchs winning the calder cup at home.  Unfortunately, I've got a feeling they'll actually manage to sell-out most of these games before the 17th, unlike every other game and series prior to this one."
losangeleskings,38ue66,dariusdetiger,2,Sun Jun 7 00:24:01 2015 UTC,"It's still incredibly frustrating, more so because it's like tossed on top of a pile of things that just seem to be ignored. Utica can barely get their sticks on the puck, it was like golden scoring chances and I feel like that was the best chance we had of getting it in for a little while now.  Hockey is hockey and long off seasons suck, so watch it where you can eh? :P I'd like this series to end quickly, but I think it is going to be tense either way, so hopefully you can get there ! :)"

I'm REALLY glad I never payed $11 for a single game, or even a package.  The quality (which probably isn't their fault, since these games aren't generally shown on TV anyway) is no where near worth that much."
losangeleskings,38ue66,Sniffman,2,Sun Jun 7 00:30:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately I don't think there's any way for them to get better quality, unless they're actually running the broadcast (which I'm pretty sure is on local access)."
losangeleskings,38ue66,dontcare345,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:34:42 2015 UTC,"Yup, which is why I say it's probably not their fault.

Reverse sweep against the biggest rivals, then the Ducks in 7 and one of the greatest Western finals in recent years. Rangers were tough too, even though it was finished in 5. 3 games had to be decided in OT, so it could have gone either way"
losangeleskings,38tb8q,Sniffman,5,Sat Jun 6 17:17:35 2015 UTC,Game 5 was probably the greatest hockey game I've even seen. That long period of play without a whistle in OT was amazing!

losangeleskings,38tb8q,missrcc,12,Sun Jun 7 09:58:17 2015 UTC,"Both our runs have been amazing, and so different from one another. I was checking the ""most boring Final series thread"" and we have gotten a lot of responses for our 2012 Final. First I thought, ""What the hell, our runs were historic"" but then thinking about just the Final in particular, it's true they might have been our most boring series'. Like, once we got to the Final, it was kind of already over, so it wasn't as captivating to other fans. Interesting perspective."
losangeleskings,38tb8q,OverlordKopi_2037,3,Sat Jun 6 20:02:16 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with that final was that EVERYONE knew what the Kings had already done up till that point, so NJ was just seen as a team that was already doomed.   The hype behind us going in to the final was probably enough to get them shaking a bit."
losangeleskings,38tb8q,RubeusShagrid,3,Sat Jun 6 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"That was amusing for me, with all the hate we get and people just thinking the finals we were in were foregone conclusions."
losangeleskings,38tb8q,flybyknight,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:25:11 2015 UTC,The 2012 series was closer than most fans remember: Games 1 & 2 went to OT and the Devils played tough in games 4 & 5. If Bernier didn't take that dumb penalty we very likely would have lost that series. Think about that for a second. There is a very small chance we'd have won game 7 in New Jersey against Brodeur after pissing away a 3-0 lead. Thanks Steve!!!
losangeleskings,38tb8q,bryan_sensei,7,Tue Jun 9 16:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yes.... by far.  I don't think we will ever see anything like that ever again.  If someone would have told me that we were going to reverse sweep SJ,  win a seven game series against SJ, Ducks and Chicago... winning all game 7's on the road I'd have said they were crazy and that it was impossible.  Of all the crazy, unlikely things that happened last year the least crazy was them beating the Rangers to win the Cup."

losangeleskings,38o7zo,EvenStrengthHero,25,Fri Jun 5 14:22:37 2015 UTC,Just as much as any other member of the Kings.  We live as a team and die as a team. Go Kings Go.
losangeleskings,38o7zo,alberthere,12,Fri Jun 5 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"Lots of numbers there but I saw it as a season of thirds:  First 1/3 (15 games) : Vezina favorite. Outstanding.  Second 1/3 (40 games): Lost critical D (Voynov, Martinez), loss of Mitchell very apparent, offensive production withered again, Quick tried to make up for it by overcompensating a ton and it backfires.  Second 1/3 (27 games): Back to normal. Calms down a bit, and the Defense rounds into shape.  He's Vezina-quality, no doubt about it. Quick's best is the NHL's best IMO, but he doesn't often find it until the game is monumental. We all very much know our D was not up to par during the season and our biggest monkey of goal production from the bottom lines were by far the biggest issue."
losangeleskings,38o7zo,Pen2Paper,8,Fri Jun 5 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"No, it was defense. Coming into the season without Mitchell and then losing Voynov on top of that was not good. 1/3 of your defense out with only AHLers to replace them.   Quick won us a hell of a lot more games than he lost us. Look at the first stretch of the season."

losangeleskings,38o7zo,Sniffman,3,Fri Jun 5 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"His only 'problem' is that every game he plays, it may not be the game everyone expects of him. He does show it every once in a while, but most often shows the ""starting goalie"" than an elite. He still is one of the best in the league"
losangeleskings,38o7zo,itanitarek10,2,Fri Jun 5 14:46:43 2015 UTC,"I pretty much expected the Kings to allow a goal in the first five shots. Sometimes they won. Sometimes they didn't.  In addition, too frequently, they allowed two and three goals in the first ten shots. That was a hole that was very difficult to dig out of.  It's often said during penalty kills that the goaltender is the most important defender. I think this holds true during five on five. I think that the Kings seemed to make a lot of defensive mistakes during the first ten minutes of most games, and Quick rarely saved them from those mistakes. So... part of the problem, sure, but not the key problem."
losangeleskings,38o7zo,humbuckermudgeon,3,Fri Jun 5 23:13:06 2015 UTC,"In terms of shootout yes, he has a great ground game that works nearly flawless with his quick blocker and glove in regulation, but shootouts he drops down and just has the puck lifted on him, can't say it's his fault for any real losses, a few odd angle goals but you can't be perfect."
losangeleskings,38o7zo,chasej805,8,Fri Jun 5 18:04:48 2015 UTC,"Or maybe its the fact that we didnt score a single shootout goal in, what, 8 straight shootouts?"
losangeleskings,38o7zo,Sniffman,6,Fri Jun 5 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, our efforts to score in the Shootout were bar-none pathetic."

losangeleskings,38o7zo,kiwirish,2,Fri Jun 5 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, but we're not expecting Quick to score on the shootout, we're expecting him to block shots, and he wasn't doing a very good job of that during the shootouts this season.    Edit: I'm not saying Quick isn't amazing, he absolutely is, but shootouts are definitely the weakest part of his game."
losangeleskings,38o7zo,Dr-Dinosaur,2,Fri Jun 5 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sure. But hes definitely not the reason we lost those shootouts"
losangeleskings,38o7zo,Sniffman,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"He was one of the reasons. He had one of the worst shootout sv% in the NHL, something like 28th among goalies who faced 20 or more shootout attempts. If you make the cutoff 15 attempts faced, he was in the 30s."
losangeleskings,38o7zo,seemonkey,2,Fri Jun 5 23:06:26 2015 UTC,"Puck handling is the weakest part of Quick's game. The shootouts are a crap shoot for goalies. If I'm remembering correctly, most goalies have the same career sv% for shootouts after a certain amount of GP."
losangeleskings,38o7zo,lordjedediah,0,Fri Jun 5 19:46:59 2015 UTC,"He wasn't as good at bailing us out when we played like shit as he normally is. And we had horrible starts to games this year. (More horrible then usual) So yeah, I guess he was part of the problem. Not even close to the biggest part though."

losangeleskings,38lm3v,TURD_F3RGUSON,8,Fri Jun 5 00:36:24 2015 UTC,I will be heartbroken if we don't sign him.
losangeleskings,38lm3v,heathrawr182,5,Fri Jun 5 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty much.  It'll be cool if we could also keep Sekera, Jones, and Williams but pretty much just Toffoli with our cap problems."
losangeleskings,38lm3v,LAKingBob,3,Fri Jun 5 02:06:15 2015 UTC,Honestly I would be fine with all of them going if we keep toff. If he goes and Williams stays I'll be so sad.
losangeleskings,38lm3v,doot_doot,6,Fri Jun 5 06:38:16 2015 UTC,"Williams' isn't going to stay.  No way that's happening cause negotiations with him failed earlier this year.  At this point in his career, I think he's looking for as much money he can get; money the Kings don't have.    I'm just worried about Toffoli, Jones, and Sekera but with more emphasis on Toffoli"
losangeleskings,38lm3v,LAKingBob,2,Fri Jun 5 07:44:31 2015 UTC,"I would say Toffoli, Sekera, Jones, in that order. Toffoli is first obviously, but we are so thin in the back. We need Sekera, even if I'm not totally sold on him. Jones is great but not at the risk of losing the other two. And Williams, I love him, but he's on in years and is going to be way too pricey to keep."
losangeleskings,38lm3v,doot_doot,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:55:43 2015 UTC,I don't follow it nearly as much but with as much talent that's come last few years does Manchester have some kids groomed that could fill some roles? Or was Toff and tanner (even king and Nolan) just gems? Seems like we have a good either picking system or training am I wrong?
losangeleskings,38lm3v,AKxTrah,2,Fri Jun 5 03:55:23 2015 UTC,Well Manchester is playing for the Calder Cup so l assume it's a good system. Let's hope just Lombardi can work his magic in the coming months.
losangeleskings,38lm3v,AKxTrah,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:18:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean you look at toffoli and Pearson, they have a lot under their belts, Toff came off a hell of a season and Pearson other than his injury was right there too. Can you start looking at these guys as part of your go to (I want to use veteran but it's not right at all) guys? You got some good leaders in your veteran core to where it's time to start bringing younger guys again instead of paying out for that guy who gets hurt down the stretch or early on and wrecks some things."
losangeleskings,38lm3v,jordanmunson,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:00:02 2015 UTC,"We've got some solid talent and a good system in Manchester, but not too many folks who are ready for the big time right now. They'll be there soon, but it would be nice if a lot of those guys had a bit more time down in the AHL."
losangeleskings,38lm3v,CrispyLardon,5,Fri Jun 5 21:38:24 2015 UTC,I would be shocked if we didn't sign Toff.
losangeleskings,38lm3v,King_of_da_Castle,4,Fri Jun 5 14:34:19 2015 UTC,"I think a team will throw an offer sheet at Toffoli and DL will match. That will ultimately lead to not signing Williams and Jones. Toffoli and Sekera sign. If no offer sheet is on the table then, Tofolli gets a bridge deal so we can resign Kopi and Sekera stays for 4.5 or so a year, probably 4-5 year contract. Toffoli gets the big bucks in 3 years. Weal will replace Williams regular season output easily if he gets the chance."
losangeleskings,38lm3v,LOUD__NOISES,3,Fri Jun 5 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's close to 100% guaranteed we will keep him.  He's higher priority than Sekera, Jones, Williams, and Stoll."
losangeleskings,38lm3v,parineum,2,Fri Jun 5 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"Williams and Stoll are basically gone already.  Toffoli will be resigned.  Sekera and Jones will likely be resigned.  Richards will continue to be shopped around. The important dates for that are probably the draft (June 26/27) and free agency (July 1st). If he isn't moved during the draft (for/with picks) the next major time to trade him would be after free agency when teams are more comfortable with what their 2015 rosters are going to look like. After those dates, if there are still no takers, a buyout becomes a serious option.  Voynov is Voynov. I think his trial date is July 6 or 7? The possible outcomes of that are a complete mystery to me. I honestly feel like almost anything can happen. The only thing I'm sure of is if he faces jail time, his contract will likely be voided. Other than that, I have no idea. Many fans are of the opinion that he'll never play for the Kings again but I'm not so sure. Regardless, if he's not playing, his contract won't count against the cap.   One caveat to Voynov's situation that I haven't seen addressed is that there is a date where teams must be cap compliant. Teams with players on LTIR have had issues with this in the past because this date is before the date you can put a player on LTIR. Those teams have had to be cap compliant including those contracts. It will be tricky if that's the situation with Voynov."

All I know is that they constantly hack and slash your players, and whenever they get a penalty called on them they will bitch at the ref and say that the other team dived. Literally every time. Utica even had a player suspended for 2 games because someone blindsided one of our players (tomas nosek) away from the play - nosek never returned and is believed to have a concussion."

But I think Kopi got the message loud and clear if his Worlds performance is any indication of his desire to do more. Those clips were marvelous.
losangeleskings,38dsx9,CrispyLardon,9,Wed Jun 3 16:22:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever noticed a GM as vocal as Lombardi is being about getting his team together and into a good place on and off the ice, or am I just reeeeally bad at paying attention to other franchises?"
losangeleskings,38dsx9,BiohazardPixie,6,Wed Jun 3 17:04:55 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know how Dewy could kick it up another notch.
losangeleskings,38dsx9,LOUD__NOISES,8,Wed Jun 3 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"It was absolutely amazing how he put up those minutes for the entire seasons. However, I think it is pretty widely known that it was impossible for the trainers to get Drew into the gym at all last year. I really hope that's true and I can't wait to see next level Dewy."
losangeleskings,38dsx9,Butt_Farrt,3,Wed Jun 3 19:42:24 2015 UTC,"Seriously.  He spent most of the season playing damn near 30 minutes every game, I really don't know how his conditioning can improve. Most of the talk all season is how much heart he has in every game."
losangeleskings,38dsx9,EinsamWulf,3,Wed Jun 3 17:59:00 2015 UTC,His ice time is incredible. He almost plays for two D players.
losangeleskings,38dsx9,Beetush,5,Wed Jun 3 19:16:32 2015 UTC,"Quick is probably already the most athletic goalie in the NHL.  Not sure who could even be considered competing with him on that front.  Maybe Let-one-in or Holtby?  Regardless, he's probably going to have a huge season next year no matter what."
losangeleskings,38dsx9,sqrlaway,2,Wed Jun 3 16:15:07 2015 UTC,"Sad that the actual Captain isn't on that list. Read something into that, or just reality? Hmmm."
losangeleskings,38dsx9,xray606,9,Wed Jun 3 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with the fact that Kopi should be competing for scoring trophies, Quick for Vezina, and Dewy for the Norris.  (Dewy should be playing at a level where there is no doubt about who the best d-man is.)"
losangeleskings,38dsx9,Doomhat,8,Wed Jun 3 16:59:41 2015 UTC,I think Dewy would have been playing at that level if he wasn't doing the work of 3 defensemen. You can't have that many minutes on the ice and expect to be at the top of your game for each one of them. Honestly the fact that he played as well as he did with all the time he was on cemented him as the best d-man in my opinion.
losangeleskings,38dsx9,Dr-Dinosaur,5,Wed Jun 3 17:24:50 2015 UTC,I completely agree with everything you said.   To be honest I'm not really sure what it looks like for Dewy to be even better.
losangeleskings,38dsx9,Doomhat,2,Wed Jun 3 18:05:15 2015 UTC,Brownie actually is working with a nutritionist already of his own accord so maybe Dean didn't feel the need to mention him since he seems to understand he's on the chopping block.
losangeleskings,38dsx9,dalbtraps,2,Wed Jun 3 22:30:33 2015 UTC,"Quick is Quick. I have no issues with his play at all this season. He was the one consistent force for us, and he was let down far too many times - either by soft defensive zone play, or a team that just couldn't score in a shootout.  I somewhat agree with Doughty- yes he played enormous minutes. But it's also a not so secret item that he isn't the most hard working guy in the world- and that's because it comes so easy to him. Sometimes generational talents need that kick to get them to understand they can be that much better. He shouldn't be in the same breath as a Keith or Weber- next year he should be the clear front runner.  And finally Anze. Something was up last year and I don't know if it was conditioning or something else. There was no drive to his game, no urgency. We saw glimpses of it, and then it would fade. His performance at the WHC was good, but it's just the WHC...so I need to take it with a grain of salt. I hope he comes in for a monster contract year season- 80+ points, 25+ goals. There is no reason he can't."
losangeleskings,38dsx9,Omnivirus,2,Wed Jun 3 23:58:44 2015 UTC,"In my mind Kopi was still our best player all year. I think in a weird way he was playing the game too fundamentally, if that can even be a knock. He was just tending to favor defensive responsibility, or circling the zone to let the team set up instead of attacking for a shot. If he shot as often and as recklessly as a guy like Ovechkin he could have 35 goals easy, but that's not the player he is."
losangeleskings,38dsx9,automatton,2,Thu Jun 4 00:25:35 2015 UTC,He really could have shot more. That's my only complaint.
losangeleskings,38dsx9,humbuckermudgeon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:57:48 2015 UTC,I think that's the next step for him- to give up some defence for the offence. It's not enough to do what he does. And I say that while thinking he's amazing. This team can't score with consistency and he needs to drive that first line there.
losangeleskings,38dsx9,Omnivirus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:27:35 2015 UTC,"Quick is Quick. I have no issues with his play at all this season. He was the one consistent force for us, and he was let down far too many times - either by soft defensive zone play, or a team that just couldn't score in a shootout.   Yeah... there were a lot of defensive breakdowns, but you could pretty much count on Quick allowing one goal in the first five shots and two to three goals in the first ten. That needs to improve.  As for shootouts, the forwards couldn't score, but Quick struggled to make stops as well.  I think he has room to improve."

losangeleskings,388bmf,zeussays,12,Tue Jun 2 17:11:12 2015 UTC,It says he threw her head into a TV then stepped on her neck and kicked her in the face. Missing a season isn't even close to punishment if that's all true.
losangeleskings,388bmf,BiohazardPixie,7,Tue Jun 2 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"We don't know yes or no about anything. You cannot say 'No that isn't true because his wife said' and /u/zeussays  cannot chime in otherwise either. There is a police report, yes, a police report does not automatically equate to the truth which is why there is a trial. Supposedly there are pictures, some of the statements by Varlamov and the hospital then and now in general sound conflicting in my opinion. If the pictures tell the story that they're throwing at Voynov, fine, and if they're making it sound worse then they are fine it will hurt the prosecutor.  This is about more than our hockey team in the end. There are at least 3 people's lives with the MOST important one by far being the little girl, that we should try to think about before our franchise. This family needs help- innocent, guilty doesn't matter. This is hell to go through and worse with a public audience.  Nothing about this is a black and white scenario."

His biggest hurdle is the legal issue.

I honestly said that, just because I actually thought they deserved better than that. I got down voted to oblivion. All I was doing is telling the truth. It's not like I made it up.

Browns numbers have taken a nose dive, so he hasn't played with Kopitar like he used to.   There are way too many factors that contributed to a lacklustre offensive year than just ""Kopitar was a let down""  Fuck that. Kopitar is a beast, and he's usually one of a handful of people that you see NOTICEABLY giving it 100% of their effort every single night.   Find me one instance where Kopi gives up on the play.   I will never have anything but crazy respect for Kopi. He still led in points, and I believe set a new franchise record for consecutive years as a points leader.   He wasn't the problem this year, and won't likely be a problem any year."

It was his lowest point since his rookie season in 2006-7 (besides the lockout season) and his fewest goals ever (again, besides the lockout).  His and the team's Corsi suggests he was still elite in the defensive side of things, but everyone not wearing 77 or 73 played poorly and failed to convert scoring chance throughout the entire season."
losangeleskings,381740,herpaderpder,3,Mon Jun 1 04:49:14 2015 UTC,only thing kopitar needs to do different is to shoot instead of passing to someone who isn't named gaborik or doughty in the offensive zone.
losangeleskings,381740,KingsfanMDJ,2,Mon Jun 1 08:00:41 2015 UTC,"My only issue with Kopi is I'd like to see him shoot more. To be honest I'd take him over almost any other center in the league based on his defensive play alone. I think people think Crosby and Datsyuk when they think center. But I think guys like Kopi, Toews and Bergeron. Especially with the system the Kings play. The fact that he is a possession beast like no other and its all just icing on the cake.   Kopi is on the ice against the elite guys every single game. Ask them what they think about him.   As a matter of fact, here's what Couture said about him.    Kopitar is the most underrated center in the NHL. We see him all the time, unfortunately. Because he combines size, strength and intelligence, he’s as difficult to play against as any player in the league. When we’re up against the Kings, I try and play like him. He’s very responsible defensively and checks very well, especially with his stick. He’s one of the best in the league at anticipating where the puck is going and jumping in to cut off cycles. Offensively, his strength presents a problem. If he gets speed coming through the neutral zone, he’s tough to contain. I try to push him to the outside as much as possible. More than anything you have to take away his space. You can’t let him get his eyes up. If you give him a second on the puck to look up, he’s going to find someone in a dangerous spot. I’ll always remember this ridiculous flip-pass he made against us in San Jose in 2010.   EDIT: Source"

losangeleskings,37x28q,AnzeBropitar,8,Sun May 31 16:30:57 2015 UTC,Ya they were throwing them all over the rink when they lost. Guess a bunch of people got off the bandwagon
losangeleskings,37x28q,georvis9,32,Sun May 31 06:45:07 2015 UTC,"FUCK THE DUCKS!  BETTER LUCK NEXT YEAR, FUCKO'S"
losangeleskings,37x28q,kiwirish,23,Sun May 31 03:00:57 2015 UTC,No luck any year...fuck em
losangeleskings,37x28q,nenright,28,Sun May 31 04:03:47 2015 UTC,Game 7 losses three years in a row?  And they all said the Ducks were built for seven game series.
losangeleskings,37x28q,kiwirish,9,Sun May 31 03:12:11 2015 UTC,dont forget all 3 were at home!
losangeleskings,37x28q,nenright,10,Sun May 31 05:15:42 2015 UTC,"I dunno, there were more Kings fans last year and tonight there were bigger cheers for Hawks goals so home ice was sort of lost on them haha"
losangeleskings,37x28q,evarga,3,Sun May 31 05:17:55 2015 UTC,"well, yeah, but technically they did have home ice. and detroit, chicago, and LA would be a lot harder to play in with the crowds and everything. at least with home ice they have about half of the fans on their side."
losangeleskings,37x28q,Lolmoqz,2,Sun May 31 05:29:12 2015 UTC,What the hell is up with that? Are STH really reselling their Game 7 tickets?
losangeleskings,37x28q,Kmart_Elvis,3,Sun May 31 17:32:22 2015 UTC,Turns out they were only built for 6
losangeleskings,37x28q,Plamadude30k,46,Sun May 31 05:59:22 2015 UTC,I was Really hoping it would've ended up 6-2. That would've been too good.
losangeleskings,37x28q,LordCheezus,15,Sun May 31 03:04:48 2015 UTC,I had the same thought. It would have been delicious like a decadent chocolate cake.
losangeleskings,37x28q,roque72,80,Sun May 31 03:42:42 2015 UTC,Fuck the Ducks. Only we can have the most SC in CA.

losangeleskings,37x28q,Zacmar,33,Sun May 31 03:29:25 2015 UTC,Ducks got smoked at home? In a game 7? With more opposing team jerseys in the building than theirs? Well color me fucking shocked!   ALL ABOARD THE BOLTS TRAIN. CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS

losangeleskings,37x28q,Nougatizer,5,Sun May 31 02:59:26 2015 UTC,I haven't heard this is so long--well done.
losangeleskings,37x28q,ballots_stones,29,Sun May 31 03:06:34 2015 UTC,The only question that remains is do we root for the Hawks for sake of the odd year even year arrangement or do we root for the lightning because we hate the hawks?
losangeleskings,37x28q,GaboKopiBrown,57,Sun May 31 03:02:38 2015 UTC,"Lightning for sure. This series is over, Fuck the Hawks."
losangeleskings,37x28q,BW4LL,15,Sun May 31 03:05:07 2015 UTC,I fucking love your username.
losangeleskings,37x28q,lakingscrzy,26,Sun May 31 07:51:19 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, for me, no matter what, the stress is over with the Ducks out of contention. Now I can watch and be happy no matter who wins. I really want to see some people on the Bolts win a cup, but I also want to see /r/hockey explode with salt if the Hawks win. Though I think I want to see the Bolts win a bit more, since /r/hockey rage is meaningless and a cup win for the Bolts would mean a lot for them."
losangeleskings,37x28q,annoyinglyclever,7,Sun May 31 03:09:14 2015 UTC,"I went through the same thing last night with the Rags losing. Watching your rivals win is 100% worse than your team losing. Still haven't realized i'll be able to watch the finals without worrying about watching the Rangers or Ducks lift the cup at the end of it. Hoorah.   As much as I want Callahan to win a cup so he and Yzerman can shove it in St. Louis' face, I'd like to see the Hawks win...if not to simply continue the reign of the Kings/Hawks in alternate years"
losangeleskings,37x28q,strangrdangr,14,Sun May 31 05:17:10 2015 UTC,Please. /r/hockey loves the hawks.
losangeleskings,37x28q,Heighdone,9,Sun May 31 04:07:37 2015 UTC,Yeah they don't really seem to mind them.
losangeleskings,37x28q,ThatKingsFan,6,Sun May 31 04:09:26 2015 UTC,The salt will flow like a river if the cup doesn't go to a new team soon--all I'm sayin'. We been havin' a monopoly with the Hawks and a splashing of the Bumble Bears.
losangeleskings,37x28q,kiwirish,7,Sun May 31 05:12:34 2015 UTC,Our teams can play a game of keepaway with Lord Stanley.

losangeleskings,37x28q,evarga,10,Sun May 31 19:18:34 2015 UTC,It's not really an odd year thing though. They won in 2010 and 2013.
losangeleskings,37x28q,gambit700,12,Mon Jun 1 00:39:53 2015 UTC,There's a 1 in both of those. That means it's odd. Duh.

losangeleskings,37x28q,Mentalseppuku,9,Sun May 31 04:05:38 2015 UTC,"I'm torn as well. A hawks win would mean a perfect bracket, but it's the Hawks. A Tampa win holds no bad feelings at all."
losangeleskings,37x28q,heathrawr182,11,Sun May 31 05:33:00 2015 UTC,"I actually really like the Hawks, they're one of my favourite teams, Kane and Toews are just great players, the uniforms are sexy and the team is just fun to watch. We had a great series last year with brilliant hockey, but I'll still go Lightning so the Cup stays warm."
losangeleskings,37x28q,TURD_F3RGUSON,6,Sun May 31 04:27:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. I grew up in Chicago and lived in LA for 30 years. So it's been hard for me to be disappointed the last few years. But Chicago is just a great team. I'm not one of those people that ""hates"" another team, unless they have some real A-holes. And Perry is a real A-hole."
losangeleskings,37x28q,gambit700,2,Sun May 31 03:13:51 2015 UTC,"With you on all points. I just want to see some exciting hockey, and I think we'll get that with these two."
losangeleskings,37x28q,sargeas,8,Sun May 31 06:26:42 2015 UTC,I respect the Hawks. I don't care about the Lightning. I'm pulling for the Hawks so we can steal it from them next year
losangeleskings,37x28q,kiwirish,2,Sun May 31 17:29:12 2015 UTC,I really don't hate the Hawks. I just want to see Morrow skate the Cup.
losangeleskings,37x28q,gambit700,2,Sun May 31 03:06:09 2015 UTC,"You always root for the teams you hope to destroy.    This season is over for the kings, nothing matters anymore and the team can't do anything until next season.  However, if the Kings and Hawks meet in the WCF next year, do you want the Kings to beat the SCF losers, or the Cup winners?  It always means more to knock out a better team, and winning or losing won't have any effect on how the Blackhawks are playing next season, so you might as well make them a juicier target."
losangeleskings,37x28q,cfox109,12,Sun May 31 15:15:42 2015 UTC,I'm just happy because people in my town can finally get rid of all their shitty ducks flags on their cars. I was getting road rage driving around lol

losangeleskings,37x28q,wiseaus_stunt_double,13,Sun May 31 03:45:14 2015 UTC,2 years in a row of Duck failings in Game 7. Are they the new Sharks?
losangeleskings,37x28q,CharSiuPorkBun,13,Sun May 31 03:20:33 2015 UTC,I believe it is now 3 years in a row losing game 7 at home
losangeleskings,37x28q,KeshasBiggestFan,11,Sun May 31 03:07:18 2015 UTC,3 in a row. They flopped in 2013 as well IIRC.
losangeleskings,37x28q,ToastedFireBomb,8,Sun May 31 03:13:32 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, that's right. 3 straight 3-2 leads. 3 straight eliminations"
losangeleskings,37x28q,Lumeris,1 point,Sun May 31 03:14:17 2015 UTC,No because they have a cup. So they haven't choked as much as the Sharks
losangeleskings,37x28q,BadAtThisKindOfThing,11,Sun May 31 04:19:41 2015 UTC,"I hate the Ducks but I'm pretty sure I hate the Hawks more, I'm not sure how to feel about this."

losangeleskings,37x28q,nenright,22,Sun May 31 03:26:33 2015 UTC,When will the western conference learn...  The Kings are the only team that can take down the Blackhawks.

losangeleskings,37x28q,AaronQ94,6,Sun May 31 04:50:21 2015 UTC,This is amazing.
losangeleskings,37x28q,cfox109,2,Sun May 31 03:03:24 2015 UTC,The best part of this is that it's Perry and I probably dislike him more than any player in the NHL.
losangeleskings,37x28q,puckpuckgo,8,Sun May 31 03:07:07 2015 UTC,"What a day. What a glorious day! I can finally relax now that they're out, here's to a good SCF!"
losangeleskings,37x28q,nenright,9,Sun May 31 03:20:03 2015 UTC,I'm in!  I left my house as soon as the game was over... Were the fans REALLY throwing towels?
losangeleskings,37x28q,BW4LL,5,Sun May 31 23:04:06 2015 UTC,"They were throwing things, I just couldn't really tell what."
losangeleskings,37x28q,humbuckermudgeon,4,Sun May 31 03:14:55 2015 UTC,"They were balling up the rally towels and throwing them at the Hawks, while they were having their picture taken with the trophy. Real classy."
losangeleskings,37x28q,whatIsaRedditt,10,Sun May 31 03:22:13 2015 UTC,BUT THE KINGS FANS ARE THE WORST FANS IN HOCKEY  or at least thats what ducks fans keep saying
losangeleskings,37x28q,ereckstein,5,Sun May 31 03:23:09 2015 UTC,I saw a Hawks player (not sure who) grab a towel and throw it back to the crowd right after the picture. It was amazing.
losangeleskings,37x28q,gambit700,6,Sun May 31 04:46:43 2015 UTC,It was Desjardins.
losangeleskings,37x28q,eventersgetoverit,3,Sun May 31 05:19:51 2015 UTC,"Also soda cups and other garbage before that, I really wondered what Hayward would say if he was there."
losangeleskings,37x28q,jbizzzzle,9,Sun May 31 06:35:44 2015 UTC,It seemed to me that Getzlaf forgot there was an important game happening.  But the most important thing to me was that the Ducks were more focused on getting hits than going after the puck. They missed so many pucks by focusing on getting the hits...
losangeleskings,37x28q,Nougatizer,6,Sun May 31 08:34:23 2015 UTC,"getzlaf has 0G, 3A, and is a -3 in his last three game 7's. 2 of his points were in garbage time when the game was basically over."
losangeleskings,37x28q,cbamerica10,6,Sun May 31 06:54:52 2015 UTC,Ducks fans right now

losangeleskings,37x28q,dontcare345,7,Sun May 31 05:26:25 2015 UTC,A team that can't fill their arena for a conference final doesn't deserve an SCF.

I'm reliving my memories through them a little vicariously, because I bet most Lightning fans didn't walk into that series expecting to beat Hank in 7 at the Garden.  Really happy for the team, the fans, Tampa in general, it's an exciting time for them and it's perfectly timed for a weekend celebration (just like our cup win last year!)

losangeleskings,37sz3x,SchroederVanPelt,1 point,Sat May 30 05:16:09 2015 UTC,Tampa vs Anaheim would be best. Tampa winning

losangeleskings,37rylm,LAKingBob,1 point,Sat May 30 01:24:08 2015 UTC,"No, the Richards situation was set off by Kopitar approaching his contracts end, and Toffoli and Pearson's contracts coming up. This is a big contract year for us.

losangeleskings,37se6e,LAKingBob,2,Sat May 30 01:33:26 2015 UTC,"If the Kings can trade Richards outright by packaging a pick or prospect, Voynov's contract is nullified, and the cap does hit 71M, it's possible that Sekera, Williams, Jones and Toffoli could fit. That's pretty much the only way though."

The most surprising stat to me was Muzzin's ability to reduce penalties taken from 27 last year to just 11 this year. That's almost Anze Kopitar good. He's second best on the team in penalty minutes per game behind Alec Martinez. Considering how high Sekera also is on that list, and with Regehr (and possibly Stoll) gone, next year's team could be extremely disciplined on the penalty front."

Yes we're competitive as fuck with them, but that's how they feel too. I don't hate the hawks.    The Ducks may not be our true rivals, but they're damn close. I don't hate them like I hate the Sharks or the Canucks, but I don't want to see them win a cup any more than I want to see the Kings out of the playoffs. A cross-town rivalry is still a rivalry.

losangeleskings,376ve9,Shackus,14,Mon May 25 10:46:48 2015 UTC,"When your team's not hot, your players aren't in recognition. You'll see more people doubting that Crosby is still the best player in the world today because his team fell flat (to a much better team).  Hell, some people think Max Pacioretty is leagues beyond Carter when really, today and a few years ago, Carter is the better player. Some people even think Brandon Saad is a better player.  He was brought in to a goal-scoring winger and he's become a top-line center on our team. You don't just do that on a Darryl Sutter team that wins Cups.   The bigger the game, the better he gets; anyone remember him torching the Ducks in game 7? How about his game winning goals in the Finals (he's got 3)? Hat trick in the Olympics for the gold-medal winner anyone? Jeff Carter is a fucking stud."
losangeleskings,376ve9,Pen2Paper,2,Mon May 25 16:43:59 2015 UTC,I remember hearing a Hawks fan saying that Brandon Saad is more valuable than anybody on the Kings roster.
losangeleskings,376ve9,AnzeBropitar,2,Mon May 25 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"Something like that, they said they wouod take Saad over Carter and Kopitar and that Saad is more dynamic than anyone on LA's roster."

He's been our best goal scorer since he was acquired, has been absolutely clutch in the playoffs, and he handled the move from wing to center like the true champion that he is."
losangeleskings,376ve9,Zanchbot,6,Mon May 25 17:17:53 2015 UTC,I personally think we would have never won a Stanley Cup without him
losangeleskings,376ve9,Lolmoqz,2,Mon May 25 19:25:33 2015 UTC,"I remember Jeff Carter who played for the Phantoms, he has always been quite good.  At the same time it doesn't bother me what so ever  if people over look him. I don't care if they over look any of our guys. Their opinions don't effect my enjoyment, and although it would be nice to see him recognized in a light other than Fuck Jeff Carter... it's just /r/hockey and they tend to be as fussy as an infant with colic when it comes to arguing about how great or bad someone is."
losangeleskings,376ve9,BiohazardPixie,2,Mon May 25 19:47:05 2015 UTC,"In fairness, it's tough to break the top 10 in centers.  Crosby, Malkin, Tavares, Seguin, Kopitar, Getzlaf, Stamkos, Toews, Bergeron, Backstrom, etc.  Carter is underrated though. Had Pearson stayed healthy, he probably would've lead the Kings in scoring and goals."

losangeleskings,36ycht,kiwirish,4,Sun May 24 03:10:02 2015 UTC,"I would agree that claiming Doughty and Muzzin as the ""best top pairing"" is a bold statement.  As much as I like Doughty, he can only do so much to cover the Kings' defensive holes.    Regarding Muzzin, my faith in him isn't too high after watching him repeatedly pass the puck to the other team.  I'm willing to look past little things like him scoring on Quick during that Predator game but I can't say I enjoy watching him paired with Doughty anymore.  What do you fellow you Kingsbros think?"

Voynov is overpaid, which isn't that big of a deal, but he cost our entire defense their legs and has done damage to his image to warrant ignoring this.    Edit: Here's a well laid out site for team cap and contracts  Not sure why the negativity. If it's for the Richards comments, we put him on waivers after the trade deadline this year hoping a team would pick him up because we couldn't trade him unless we gave our best prospects. If it's for Voynov, well that's just like your opinion, man."
losangeleskings,36wsz4,masteroftheuniverse6,3,Sat May 23 00:13:53 2015 UTC,"OTOH, if Voynov is acquitted and is healthy enough to play, his salary isn't so bad."

No way he is ready to go until mid-season at best, and then we got a rusty D-man with domestic violence baggage coming off of a MAJOR injury...I'm pretty sure DL is looking for ways out of that deal.

ANYONE BUT THE SUCKS  <don't mind me....I'm over here in the corner sulking until October>"
losangeleskings,36kwzp,Sonofnel17,2,Wed May 27 22:30:39 2015 UTC,i don't want either west team to win the cup. But I am rooting for the ducks for this round. In my eyes the hawks are a bigger rival than the ducks.
losangeleskings,36kwzp,wmnoe,5,Wed May 20 06:00:37 2015 UTC,"Yup, totally agree. Hatred for Hawks>Ducks.  Want the Bolts all the way."

losangeleskings,36kwzp,InRustWeTrust,1 point,Wed May 20 07:57:20 2015 UTC,I guess I am leaning more towards the Hawks. I don't like either team. Ultimately I would like TB to win out of the remaining teams but I honestly don't think NY or TB will be able to beat the Ducks or Hawks.

losangeleskings,36l1qz,Lolmoqz,3,Wed May 20 20:18:41 2015 UTC,"With Raccoon Jesus working on the back nine and mentally preparing for next year.  I think we should too.  I think that Staples Center is a great barn, and having Bailey be a part of NHL 16 is cool, but I think we are missing something.  Chants.  Of the 10-15 or so games I have gone to, the only thing that I have heard is ""Na na na na na na na, HAY (pause for effect) YOU SUCK!""  Classic, but stale and lacks originality.  Maybe we could all band together in the off season and come up with a few good ones, or agree on some of the better more fun classic ones. and bring them to Staples next season so NHL 17 will have our work be shown!"
losangeleskings,36l1qz,EinsamWulf,2,Wed May 20 04:17:01 2015 UTC,"I love some of the chants that fans of the Ontario Reign have. Perhaps my favorite is:  Announcer: ""[Opposing Team] is back to full strength""  Fans: ""and they still suck"".  I've heard other people mention this chant so maybe it's used elsewhere but Ontario is the only place I've witnessed it."

losangeleskings,36kt2i,Shackus,3,Wed May 20 02:56:03 2015 UTC,There was a lot of missed calls.  That is part of the game but the quantity in this game was crazy.  So man pic/interference events that went unnoticed that the Ducks were using to their advantage.  I am not usually a fan of ticky-tack interference calls but there comes a point where it really effects the flow of the game.  Goalie interference too.  In OT Crawford was run into and his stick knocked into the faceoff circle and the refs let play continue.  Crazy.
losangeleskings,36kt2i,pbjamm,3,Wed May 20 15:16:53 2015 UTC,"I think we can all agree the officiating was terrible last night. There were so many missed calls and the referees appear to be puck magnets as well. Here's hoping for better calls for the rest of the series.

Lombardi needs to retool the backend a little. Getting Sekera signed is a priority. 8/6 - 7/3 - 27/2 and who knows, maybe a long shot of Voynov coming back.  Pearson/Toffoli/McNabb/Muzzin will be another year older. The Kings will be fine next year, this was an off year and they've gotten 6 months to rest up.   Trading our fucking captain isn't going to solve anything, this is exactly why teams take steps backwards. Panic trades."
losangeleskings,361bpr,LAKingBob,7,Fri May 15 10:34:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  While I don't want Brown gone, I think he needs to find his game.  It seemed like there were moments where he had flashes of soft hands/sniping but he'll play like a power forward.    Probably needs to work on his skating a bit more haha  Edit: Kopitar needs to find his offensive game too.  I felt like he played more reserved and defensively instead of taking shots at the net"
losangeleskings,361bpr,Pen2Paper,3,Fri May 15 11:50:54 2015 UTC,"He was a little of the problem. We can't put it all on the McBad duo. He has continued to regress offensively (27 pts in 82 games = poor), and was not as sturdy defensively or in his checking game as seasons past (-17 +/-)."

losangeleskings,361bpr,mrsambo99,-1,Fri May 15 14:02:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think Dustin Brown is a terribly problematic player on the ice, nor is this really about missing the playoffs.  This is about the potential of running into a financial buzzsaw with the number of long costly contracts on our books, of which the most troublesome are Voynov, Richards, and Brown.  Voynov and Richards are lost causes, but Brown is a young, serviceable player who I believe many fringe-y teams would love to have (Dallas comes to mind).  Consider this question.. what if Brown didn't wear a ""C"" on his jersey?  I think a lot of people are getting hung up on his Captaincy as the reason he's worth keeping despite his lack of production.  I don't think he would get such an easy pass if he wasn't ""the Captain.""  The Kings already have many strong leaders (Kopitar/Doughty/Carter/Greene/Gaborik?).  The Kings also have a fantastic group of young players who represent the new wave of talent (as you mention, Pearson/Toffoli/McNabb/Muzzin, and Sekera is 28 but still needs to be a priority as you say).  The Captaincy is just a ""C"".  I agree that the Kings will be fine next year.. but I also think they will be fine with or without Brown."
losangeleskings,361bpr,LAKingBob,12,Fri May 15 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"He's not going anywhere. He might not have as many points, but he's a powerhouse and knows how to be a Captain imo. Not making the playoffs this year won't be blamed on him and be his exit, it was a cumulative of lots of shit and he'll stay."
losangeleskings,361bpr,CrispyLardon,9,Fri May 15 10:32:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think trading Brown is a good idea when Kopitar isn't scoring that much either.  Yes Brown isn't producing as much as other captains in the league but I feel he is a valuable asset to the Kings.  There's a reason why Brown is considered to be one of the best captains in the league and why he was one of the alternative captains for the Olympics last year.  I would rather let Stoll, Richards, and Williams (<- don't want it to happen but it will) go and focus on bringing in new talent."
losangeleskings,361bpr,crass_bonanza,2,Fri May 15 11:57:16 2015 UTC,Will definitely be sad to see Williams go. =[
losangeleskings,361bpr,crass_bonanza,7,Fri May 15 15:19:42 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, this is way off base on so many levels.  First off I am glad that you have intimate knowledge as to what happened in the Voynov residence for you to call him a wife beater.  Second off, I am confused how you came up with the 2/3rds contract over 16 years, unless there is a part of the CBA I missed, I do not think that is possible.  The buyout is spread over twice the length of the remaining contract, in this case it would be 10 years.  It isn't spread equally though, the CBA had buyout variables put in place to punish teams who signed cap diving contracts.  That means that we will have almost 5 mm in dead cap space for 2 years in '17-'19.  There is no way that O'Donnell would have been captain, he was 37 and had just returned to the Kings.  Maybe Handzus if you were looking for a vet, but even then I just don't see it.  As for Kopitar at captain, I have watched him disappear for a 20 game stretch every single year he has been in the league.  He is amazing, but at least with Brown he is giving the same energy game in and game out.  Brown has had some down years, but that also correlates with him getting 3rd line ice time.  He is a former 30 goal scorer who will be put back on the first line this year with Kopi and will be given an opportunity to get some of his numbers back.  What free agents do you see coming up that we could use that cap space on?  Have you seen this years selection?  Maybe he does get traded, but this seems very reactionary and I don't think you want to see this Kings core without Brown, Williams, Stoll, Regher all in 1 year.  Part of what made the team special was the solid leadership and we are losing a lot of that this season, might as well rebuild if we end up losing more."
losangeleskings,361bpr,crass_bonanza,1 point,Fri May 15 15:50:03 2015 UTC,"Voynov is dead to the Kings front office.. doesn't matter what happened or what my intimate knowledge of it is.  It's unfortunate, and I withhold personal judgment on the guy, but perception is everything.  Forgive my error on the Richards buyout.  A buyout should be a consideration though.. Whether he's in Manchester or sailing into the sunset, he's equally useless to us.  It's a tough situation and a tough decision.  Handzus is a good choice, but my point was that it didn't matter who.  I think it would have been best to keep the C warm until Kopi proved himself.  There are some good free agents out there.. don't let the relative weakness of this years crop fool you.  Among D-men, Mike Green/Franson/Paul Martin/Ehrhoff/Beauchemin come to mind.. up front, there's Ribeiro/Soderberg/Vermette/Belesky/J. Ward/Frolik.  Not stellar, but there are definitely some promising players in there, either as rentals or long-term.  As I mentioned in another reply, our leadership is rock solid with or without Brown."
losangeleskings,361bpr,crass_bonanza,3,Fri May 15 19:24:59 2015 UTC,"Neither I nor you know what is goign on the heads of the front office in regards to the Voynov situation, you may be right though.  That list of free agents is really bad.  Who of those players would we actually want to sign?  Erhoff maybe.  Soderberg possibly.  There really isn't much of an upgrade out there.  As for the leadership core, you say it is rock solid, but who are the leaders if we lose all of them?  We lost Scuderi and Mitchell, we are going to lose Reggie, Stoll, Williams and Richie and now you propose losing Brown?  That is basically the entire leadership core for the 2 cup runs gone."
losangeleskings,361bpr,bfurlong,1 point,Fri May 15 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"The thing with the Voynov situation is that it comes on the heels of all the domestic abuse stuff that happened in the NHL.. I feel the Kings would want nothing to do with it, but you're right, no one knows for sure.  Who we approach in Free Agency really comes down to our needs after we've dealt with the existing players hitting the market..  I doubt we'll hang onto Williams, and with Stoll, Richards, and perhaps Brown gone, there will be spots to fill up front.  Our young guys will take on more important roles, and justifiably so.  I'd love a guy like Soderberg with lots of potential to come in and work his way into the system.. I think he has a great future.  I would also like Frolik at maybe 3 years/12MM.. I'm cautious about Beleskey because I think teams will reach for him.  On the D end, losing Regehr/Voynov obviously presents a need there.. I've always liked Ehrhoff.  Cody Franson would be nice too.  Lubo is a UFA!  How bout we bring him back for a farewell tour?  Poor guy deserves to know what it's like to play on a good Kings team.  =)  I don't know about you, but I think Kopitar/Doughty/Carter/Greene/Quick is a VERY solid leadership core (at all positions too).  It's so easy to let nostalgia get in the way of rational future-minded decision making.. If every King on the 11-12 team was still a King, wouldn't we be worse off now?  There are downsides to the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" mentality I referred to in my OP.  Shipping Brown would provide the flexibility we need to keep core contributors and add those essential role-players that come in and give us that familiar late JOLT that won two cups."
losangeleskings,361bpr,nickmakhno,2,Fri May 15 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"I dunno dude, I look at a guy like Soderberg and he is 29 years old already, how much potential for growth does he still have?  Same with a guy like Frolik, why give him 4 mm when he will probably end up putting the same amount of points as Brown on the board?  Erhoff could be fun(injuries), Franson looked awful in Nashville and Lubo is 38 and 5' 10"", I just don't think now is the time to ""vote for lubo!"", haha.  Doughty, Carter and Kopi are not the leadership core, I just don't see it.  They are our leaders in the skill department, but not in the gritty, fight for every inch department.  Who knows, but I think that Brown deserves at least another chance due to what he has provided to this organization.  He is an impeccable leader on and off the ice and gives it his all every single game."
losangeleskings,361bpr,iamthesheriff,1 point,Fri May 15 21:16:04 2015 UTC,"I respect your position and I'm enjoying this back-and-forth.  Here's a question.. Are ""being a leader"" and ""being gritty"" really meant to be so intertwined?  The NHL today is faster than it's ever been.. it is trending more and more toward finesse and speed than ever before.  I feel like our core guys Kopi/Doughty/Carter emphasize this style of play beautifully.    Don't get me wrong, the hockey will never LOSE it's grittiness.. but I don't think grittiness should it be married to leadership.  The best leaders are the ones who can show, by example, how hockey is played BEST."
losangeleskings,361bpr,CrispyLardon,2,Fri May 15 21:46:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, I am loving this discussion as well.  I just love talking/discussing/arguing hockey, especially Kings hockey.  The grittiness I was talking about is more along the lines of playoff hockey.  When the games get brutal and the whistles are stashed away, it is those players who succeed in that environment.  That rise above and carry their teammates with them.  It might not be true at all, but that is the way that I have always seen the true leadership core of the Kings."
losangeleskings,361bpr,weirdalec222,4,Fri May 15 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"All I could think about after reading  an experienced playoff ""wildcard"""
losangeleskings,361bpr,LOUD__NOISES,3,Fri May 15 07:37:22 2015 UTC,"Brown is losing his touch. I love him and he is a great leader, but the cap hit is going to be a roadblock for the Kings a couple years down the line. The cap can't rise indefinitely, especially with some teams struggling and the Canadian dollar weakening. Unless he finds his game, I see him getting traded before his contract is up. The issue is if Dean waits too long they might have trouble finding a taker if Brown doesn't find his game/deteriorate more."
losangeleskings,361bpr,QuickerThanFasth,7,Fri May 15 15:15:34 2015 UTC,Nah
losangeleskings,361bpr,LAKingBob,2,Fri May 15 07:32:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, our downfall began with losing Slava and Mitchell at virtually the same time. Then after that we got plagued with random big injuries and a streak of no scoring by the entire roster (not just Brown). Then, through all of that, we had way too many won games fall through the cracks by way of OT losses and SO losses. Now, you can make a case that it was partly Brown's fault that we couldn't close out a lot of games in regulation or OT, but I would argue it was the entire team's fault equally, and it was definitely not Brown's fault that we lost so many SO's.  But don't get me wrong, Brown does have room for improvement in the skating and scoring departments--but it was definitely a team effort to not make the playoffs last year. I don't think he is going anywhere, and I don't want him to either--just my two cents."

As you say, it was much much more than his lack of production.  Obviously injuries plagued us since the very beginning.  I wouldn't even call it a ""downfall"" as it really came down to the last two games of the season (still pissed about that Oilers game).    I love Brown and all he has done for the team, but I'm confident we have enough talent and leadership ability to succeed without him.  Ditching the contract would give us much needed flexibility cap and roster-wise."

If I'm not mistaken the Staples Center was built for the Kings and Concerts, not so much the basketball teams. The only thing I wish the Kings did is to add on the laser intro. I really like the on ice projections that a lot of teams do, and I just wish the Kings did that as well."
losangeleskings,35o882,thegetawayplan9,2,Tue May 12 15:50:16 2015 UTC,It was built for the Lakers and Kings as far as I know. AEG owns part of the Lakers.

losangeleskings,35nx13,Anewman1188,9,Wed May 13 22:51:16 2015 UTC,Well a team is going to pick him up since the Kings can't afford what Williams is looking for.  Might as well be a team on the eastern conference where the Kings don't have to see him too often and it'll hurt less for us :(
losangeleskings,35nx13,LAKingBob,3,Wed May 13 22:54:52 2015 UTC,Take him. I've already accepted it. :(
losangeleskings,35nx13,LOUD__NOISES,2,Thu May 14 05:46:12 2015 UTC,"What a ridiculous article. If Justin Williams was willing to take under $4 mil AAV for two years, he'd be re-signed with the Kings by now."
losangeleskings,35nx13,inalasahl,2,Thu May 14 07:29:18 2015 UTC,Precisely. What a vacuous article with no research into his contract negotiations.
losangeleskings,35nx13,anexanhume,1 point,Thu May 14 16:01:39 2015 UTC,I really see Williams signing with NJ or Philly since his home in the offseason is nearest to those two teams.  I don't see Pittsburgh doing this since the last thing they need is another top 6 forward.

I'm sure they a lot of players do great stuff but this one just had me saying 'Fucken Duncan Keith' ina good way.

losangeleskings,35klza,PissOnEddieShore,6,Mon May 11 11:16:02 2015 UTC,"You lucked out by facing them. The Jets were not ready for prime time. Them and the Flames have looked happy just to be in the postseason, but they both lack the experience to really do anything (other than upset a vulnerable Vancouver team). I can't think of a team that has had an easier path to the WCF in the past 10 years, now, to be clear, Anaheim did earn that right by having a great regular season. I hope the WCF is more interesting than the previous rounds."

Based on the Kings' regular season, and our regular season series, I still think we would have got you in 6 games or so. Although I know it's meaningless to say that, who knows.   Chicago, Rangers, Lightning smoked us this season, so I'm extremely afraid. The real post-season starts now."

The regular season is a completely different beast than the playoffs. And by ""so much"" what do you mean? The Kings beat both teams during the regular season it's not like they got swept. I never said the Jets were weak in fact I said just the opposite. Besides OP asked for an opinion and I offered mine. The Ducks are nowhere near as strong as most of their fans seem to think they are, that was my point."

losangeleskings,35bv0z,cantremembr,2,Fri May 8 20:57:25 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

losangeleskings,35baod,LAKingBob,5,Fri May 8 18:08:47 2015 UTC,"(2:49PM)   Social worker acknowledged he “arm-twisted” Varlamova to get answers. Made it tough to argue that her statements to him were spontaneous / Defense says officer took statements an hour later after Varlamova was at hospital. Not spontaneous. Judge: officer Gregory Wiist testimony admissible in trial. Varlamova allegedly told Wiist that Voynov hit her, and had previously. Judge seems to have deferred decision on nurse Wong testimony. They didn’t discuss nurse Parcon. I have no idea why. Defense arguing statements ""this is not the first time"" should be thrown out bec no evidence exists of prior abuse. Defense argues no one knows what ""this"" is in statement ""this is not the first time."" DA says ""this"" in her statement ""this is not the first time""  is ""aggression.""    (3:22PM)   So far, we have 3 rulings that allow the police officer and two hospital workers to testify that Varlamova said #SlavaVoynov hit her......pushed her into the TV, and it wasn't the first time.  All that if she refuses to testify. Varlamova lawyer says she has appointment to start domestic violence counseling on Wednesday. Judge wants update by May 27 as to whether further therapy is needed and whether Varlamova has reconsidered about testifying / Judge wants her to go to 3 sessions by May 27, & report back. She can indicate then if she needs more therapy & state position on testifying Statements made by Varlamova to others about previous Voynov violence will be allowed in trial testimony. Now they are arguing about coercion. Defense: Medical treatment was withheld until she answered questions. ""Clearly coercive in naturre"" Defense has several arguments to try to eliminate Varlamova's statements to police, hospital workers. So far, they are not winning. Defense saying Varlamova answers were coerced, because she was denied medical treatment until she answered questions. Defense: Coercion argument: ""Unless you talk to us we are not going to treat you""   (3:46PM)   Judge: Varlamova statements to witnesses were not coerced, will be allowed at trial (other than those made to social worker) Essentially, if Voynov's wife doesn't testify, everything she said to two nurses & a security guard about being hit will be allowed at trial If Varlamova changes her mind and does testify, this entire hearing is moot. #SlavaVoynov hearing is over   Here's Larry Altman article on todays hearing.  And here's Rich Hammonds article.  Haven't heard what's next or when."

If that's truly an issue, why is anyone playing in the Worlds right now?  Wouldn't they benefit from extended time off?  Or is this kind of tournament a non-issue?"

Guys who need it are doing that, those that feel confident and comfortable in the long haul are getting extra practice and play time in and I really would like to hope playing on the bigger rinks might help some of them come regular season.  Martin Jones for example. It's great that he's playing for Canada, fantastic.  Kopitar, if he can work through his issues with shooting and whatever frustrating he has that's good. Brown seems to need and want the time to settle down and spend time at home and maybe the down time well help him bounce back a bit."
losangeleskings,356xi0,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Thu May 7 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the tournament is a non-issue.  It's not like a physical playoff run against the best teams. It's a handful of international hockey games against less than NHL caliber for the most part. And it's a chance for some development: Jones gets some games, Toffoli plays with some high scorers, Muzzin plays with a good defensive core. Same thing with Shore in the AHL playoffs.  Ideally, yeah, everyone on the roster should be in a cryogenic chamber for the entirety of the offseason. But playing in a tournament for you dad ain't gonna hurt anyone."

However, even a year ago, regular season games still barely filled 1/2 the arena.  It is a larger than normal AHL arena though.  EDIT: Also wanted to point out that people here are die hard New England fans. Sure, it's great we have an AHL team, but we aren't all that invested in the LA Kings franchise.  When the Providence Bruins are in town, the place is packed, otherwise the arena is pretty empty.  I'm just hoping it's a Grand Rapids/Manchester finals.  I grew up in Detroit.  Been to only a couple Monarchs games and this will be the only/last chance I'll get to watch the Red Wings prospects play."

losangeleskings,3558i5,LAKingBob,10,Thu May 7 05:24:17 2015 UTC,We can sign him for cheaper but I don't think the Kings should.  I think it's time to give the youngers guys a chance to learn and develop into bigger roles (i.e. Shore).
losangeleskings,3558i5,RubyRhod,2,Thu May 7 05:32:01 2015 UTC,"Even before the cocaine arrest, I didn't think we should sign him because of how terrible he played last season. He was a huge liability and often took terrible offensive zone penalties."
losangeleskings,3558i5,Scientolojesus,2,Thu May 7 16:55:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's always best to move on from players with bad off field/ice behavior and incidents. Typically goes bad in all sports and if the production isn't as great as it should be, then to me it's a no brainer.   I'm a Kings fan living in Texas so I don't get to watch them every day like I did when living in LA. But when I have been able to watch them, Stoll didn't seem to play as well as he did previously. You guys probably know more than I do though. NFL is my favorite sport, but again, football has many great examples of tainted players. And many times the player in question can better themselves when they move to a new city.  PS- Sorry for the book I just posted haha. I love the Kings. Main reason why I'm not keeping up with the playoffs cuz they're not playing. And I think the NHL playoffs are almost as exciting to watch as NFL..."

losangeleskings,3558i5,Omnivirus,2,Thu May 7 19:41:17 2015 UTC,"No thanks. My opinion has nothing to do with his personal life, I just think we need to get younger and more productive players. This year he seemed to really step up his stupid penalty game. In fact I feel we were overpaying the last few years for a faceoff guy that takes bad penalties and who doesn't provide much offense."

losangeleskings,34zj17,LAKingBob,1 point,Wed May 6 03:41:42 2015 UTC,"Ideally, the Kings should keep him if he's found to be not guilty because he didn't do anything wrong as far as we know.  Like what you said before, all we're getting are rumors, speculations, and contradicting reports about the incident.  But realistically- considering what the Kings had to do without Voynov; pick up Sekera, McNabb, McBain, Folbert, etc I don't think it would be fair to them either if we had to drop them for Voynov.  I think if Voynov's found to be not guilty, he would have to be traded.    But if he's found to be guilty, then I'm pretty sure everyone is on board with letting him go.  I know I am."

losangeleskings,34zj17,Helios321,1 point,Wed May 6 06:12:31 2015 UTC,"losing Regehr and possibly trading off Stoll would free up some cap space.....lets not forget that Voynov is key defensive player for the team. Its a rough spot because it looks like an open shut case of domestic violence thus hes being crucified.....but it seems different to me, especially considering how she went with him to the hospital and didnt want to be separated. Maybe they both realized a conviction would ruin their livelihoods, maybe not.   Feels like Voynov's case isnt even close to Mayweather, and we all paid a shit ton to watch him fight this past week."
losangeleskings,34zj17,zattk94,5,Fri May 8 11:00:04 2015 UTC,"For either side really. The prosecution has to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

losangeleskings,34zj17,32Quick32,1 point,Wed May 6 07:24:05 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking about this all day. I also had an idea as to what would be, imo the best outcome.  I don't think the Kings would want to deal with the PR hit that would come with Voynov being on the team. We should sign Sekera, and trade Voynov. Who would the trade partner be? The Oilers. With the Oilers having the 1st overall pick, they will get Connor Mcdavid. That being said, they will be loaded down the center. 1C McDavid 2C RNH 3C Lander 4C Roy. They definitely need help with defense and the Kings could use a high end center prospect, Leon Draisaitl. IMO Draisaitl is a movable piece for them.  Putting the pieces together wasn't exactly easy to think about but I believe I came up with a reasonable trade.  We should trade Weal for a 2/3 round pick for this year. So the pieces going over would be: Voynov, 2015 2/3 round pick(Weal trade), 2015 2/3 round pick 2017 2/3 round pick, Ebert and ONeill. My question in return is, do you think that's enough?"

I think his ceiling is probably a bit higher than Vey's, but atm he's probably a bit behind him in value due to his size.

losangeleskings,34zj17,Doomhat,1 point,Wed May 6 15:57:06 2015 UTC,"Said it in the earlier comment...will say it here:  If he isn't convicted we have his salary, period.    We might trade him, but won't get anything for him since he's got this against him.  Best case is he retires from the NHL and goes to the KHL.  His deal doesn't terminate when he's 35+, and the contract isn't the evasive type that Kovalchuk had, so I don't think there are any repercussions for the Kings.    I could be totally wrong about that though."

losangeleskings,34toj5,thegetawayplan9,2,Mon May 4 19:37:03 2015 UTC,I'm the same though I've seen some dirty games with the canucks so they are higher than the Hawks for me

losangeleskings,34toj5,krucz36,13,Mon May 4 20:21:41 2015 UTC,Canucks I knew were going to shit the bed.  The fact that the Jets did was a bonus of sorts. And the Flames Cinderella run looks to be running out of steam. Not even two weeks ago I was being barraged by formerly meek Flames and Jets fans as though they were the second coming of the Habs dynasties. Now they've all shut up.  Still think this is gonna end up Chicago/NYR.
losangeleskings,34toj5,Omnivirus,9,Mon May 4 14:55:36 2015 UTC,"Its very disappointing. Because not many teams can shutdown the Blackhawks and Ducks. The Kings had an off year and would have likely struggled too, but there is a better chance they would have put up a good fight for those two teams."
losangeleskings,34toj5,TheEw0kGamer,6,Mon May 4 15:43:36 2015 UTC,I agree with this statement
losangeleskings,34toj5,Squarebush10,4,Mon May 4 22:45:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone really expected the Canucks to make it past the first round. I'd hoped the Flames would be able to put up more of a fight against the Ducks, but the meltdown I was hoping for all season seems to finally be happening (now that I don't want it to, of course).  Now, as bad as it makes me feel, I'm rooting for Chicago. I feel they're the only ones left who are capable of taking out the Ducks. Nothing would make me more unhappy than to see Bruce Boudreau lift the cup."

We DO NOT need Anaheim winning a Cup to continue that. Did you forget how big of douches Ducks fans were win they won The Cup first?!? All their bullshit about how they won it first. No thank you! Another Cup equalizes the only advantage we have over them as a franchise. I really can't  understand true Kings fans who have this mentality that they want to see our archrival win another championship. Anyone BUT Anaheim please."

losangeleskings,34sjjt,Omnivirus,6,Mon May 4 14:56:51 2015 UTC,hawks in 5/6
losangeleskings,34sjjt,nenright,6,Mon May 4 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"Unless the 2k15 Leafs or Oilers somehow made the play offs by finding a golden Willy Wonka ticket- I can't imagine any teams fan base who wouldn't think or believe they could take it all right now. It's too soon in round 2 for any team to be considered dead in the water although I fear for Wild right now.  Besides, play offs started and 8 teams in the west were basically like 'The Kings are out! The cup is ours this year!'  Personally I'd like to see neither Hawks or Ducks in the SCF but that is sadly unrealistic."
losangeleskings,34sjjt,BiohazardPixie,10,Mon May 4 19:30:23 2015 UTC,"They've played Winnipeg and Calgary, 2 of the 4 weakest teams in the playoffs throw in Pittsburgh and Ottawa from the East. Shooting on elite tenders like Pavelec and Hiller. I know there are no ""easy teams"" in the playoffs but let's be real...They got a pretty weak route to the WCF.   It will be a HUGE difference from playing WPG and CGY when they inevitably face the Hawks(a team they've struggled with) in the Conference Final. And even if they get passed them they'll still have to deal with WSH, NYR, TBL or MTL...4 tough teams.  People need to pump the breaks on the Ducks Cup talk while still being in the 2nd round. Lot of hockey left to be played.   Hawks/Lighting are my SCF pick."
losangeleskings,34sjjt,BlueApple10,4,Mon May 4 07:00:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know, the Jets were not an easy team for them to play against. And it showed on the ice, where the jets dominated most of the ice time only to be unlucky as the Ducks got some late goals. Calgary, on the other hand, is a weak possession team with a small roster, which only makes it easy on the possession-capable, bigger Ducks. But I do agree with the statement that the series against Chicago/Minnesota could potentially tear them apart, especially if its against Chicago. Then don't even get me started on Tampa"
losangeleskings,34sjjt,Pen2Paper,2,Mon May 4 14:54:47 2015 UTC,"True that the Jets weren't an easy team to play but I think people were overrating the Jets coming into the playoffs because it was a feel good story. But a team with Bryan Little and Mathieu Perreault down the center just can't compete with a team with Ryan Getzlaf and Ryan Kesler down the middle, especially in the Playoffs.   Don't get me wrong, the Ducks are good but are they 6-0 good? I think a big part of it is who they got matched up with."
losangeleskings,34sjjt,WoozleWuzzle,1 point,Mon May 4 23:07:26 2015 UTC,"The Jets are a ""match-up dream for the Ducks; big, physical, and poor puck-movers. Ducks are big, physical, and great puck-movers. They preyed on Winnipeg all year long."
losangeleskings,34sjjt,herpaderpder,1 point,Thu May 7 14:30:03 2015 UTC,"Well every round it gets tougher for all teams. So it is still anybody's guess. But the Ducks are still quite dominant and if anything it is resting them more when it's been such a breeze. So even if the other teams are really good, they're going through tougher series while the Ducks heal and stay rested. That's scary. Ducks winning it all is a possibility. I obviously don't want it, but I won't be surprised either. Still it's hard to say just yet."

losangeleskings,34bfyg,bryan_sensei,1 point,Fri May 1 23:05:45 2015 UTC,"I think that's overstating it.  This article alludes to Voynov et al. moving up ahead of him, like you mentioned.  But as the article goes on to mention, he's a bust.  The pick can yield an NHL player while at the same time still being a bust.   As a GM if you have a top 5 pick and the player doesn't become a regular contributor for your team or fetch some other kind of asset in trade, that pick is a bust.  The Kings drafted and developed Hickey and at the end of all of that they had to let him walk via waivers for nothing.  Dean did well in the 2007 draft overall, but the selection of Hickey (and I guess to a lesser extent, the team's handling of Oscar Moller) was ultimately a disappointment."

I am not as high on Harkins as you seem to be, but maybe someone here can change my mind. Overall, I think you pretty well covered all the possibilities and accurately labeled them as Steals, Value, and Reaches.   I think we go BPA, and my list would start with Timo Meier. But whoever we pick, I think it will be Dean's BPA."
losangeleskings,34bfyg,banksy_,2,Wed Apr 29 23:19:51 2015 UTC,"Harkins comes from a hockey family, he doesn't excel to elite levels in any one area he's just super well rounded two way player who will grow into a larger frame. He's got the right work ethic to be a great possession player who can set up scoring chances or shut them down if needed. Not the most enticing prospect at first look but he's fits the Sutter mold."

Is College the new Russian Factor? If we went for him in the second we still might have to trade up a few spots, that is all contingent on who we pick first though."

losangeleskings,34bfyg,herpaderpder,2,Thu Apr 30 08:13:46 2015 UTC,We did lose two huge defense men (obviously pending Voynov's future status).  I wouldn't be surprised to see BPA among the defense men.

losangeleskings,34bfyg,banksy_,2,Fri May 1 21:20:44 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming the draft board will look something like this:  1-5: well established top 5  6-8: Provorov, Werenski, Barzal  9/10: Crouse, Rantanen   11-15: Meier, Zacha, Connor, Merkley, Harkins  I really like Connor and Merkley, but as you said they will likely shy away from Merkley due to size (though it's not impossible they pick him). I don't know much about Harkins but I've heard good things.   Looking at this and thinking about who other teams will take, I think they'll get Zacha or Connor. But we'll see.

losangeleskings,3435yk,RubyRhod,2,Mon Apr 27 23:23:35 2015 UTC,"I watched every game. He was't crisp and made a lot of mistakes he usually doesn't, exacerbated by us being crushed by the Voynov situation.   His play this year was still top 10. I just think if you ranked his play, it would be towards the bottom of the list."
losangeleskings,3435yk,anexanhume,3,Mon Apr 27 23:58:37 2015 UTC,"He didn't have the best year stats wise, but he played a metric shit ton of minutes while still being a positive CorsiRel player on the best corsi team in the league."
losangeleskings,3435yk,RubyRhod,2,Tue Apr 28 00:16:17 2015 UTC,"I was more commenting on how fickle the voters are. But also, TOI doesn't mean he's the ""best defensemen"" in the league. It means our team was suffering from depth issues."

losangeleskings,33j3nb,nenright,3,Thu Apr 23 01:01:35 2015 UTC,Toews +/- was 30.  Kopi's was -2.
losangeleskings,33j3nb,sisamouth,2,Thu Apr 23 01:47:38 2015 UTC,I think that says plenty more about the team than their individual performances though.
losangeleskings,33j3nb,CaptainH00die,3,Thu Apr 23 02:02:19 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but Kopi had a pretty lackluster year - not just in terms of scoring.  I noticed a number of times throughout the season that he simply wasn't back-checking, which resulted in goals against the Kings.  He seemed to start hustling a bit after his kid was born, but he just wasn't there for the earlier part (the majority) of the season."
losangeleskings,33j3nb,sisamouth,2,Thu Apr 23 03:06:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true also. 16 goals on the season doesn't really help his case. If Toews got this it would not be undeserved."
losangeleskings,33j3nb,CaptainH00die,2,Thu Apr 23 04:04:59 2015 UTC,"Well, he's making up for the goals with a literal fuck ton of assists, and had he not had only 10 points in his first 30 games, he'd probably have the same point total as last year."

I know Brown has intangibles but 5.8million is a lot for someone who is posting his numbers. Oh we also don't have a 2nd goalie at the moment so there's that.  Edit: Tldr: 17 players 64.15million
losangeleskings,33imas,Syben,0,Wed Apr 22 23:47:33 2015 UTC,Intangibles = Stanley Cup Championships.

losangeleskings,33iiez,RubyRhod,2,Wed Apr 22 21:00:46 2015 UTC,What a terrible decision not to buy him out last year.
losangeleskings,33iiez,INFGeoff,2,Thu Apr 23 18:32:00 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a terrible decision. DL showed loyalty to a player that helped bring us two cups. That does not go unnoticed by the players. If anything, Richards should have been moved to the AHL sooner."
losangeleskings,33iiez,RubyRhod,3,Thu Apr 23 21:12:16 2015 UTC,"He already showed a lot of loyalty to the players with the Brown, Gabbo, Doughty, Martinez, Muzzin, Voynov, Quick contracts. Richards was trending downwards and he should have been cut. This goal is to win a cup.   And if having a player take up 5+ million dollars that could have been spent bringing in better players, then they will accept a buyout. Not to mention, that 5 mill potentially cutting into their own slice of the pie (Kopi and Toffoli both have to be resigned soon).   DL is loyal. He just took it one step too far."
losangeleskings,33iiez,alljake,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:33:53 2015 UTC,"It kind of was. Better a year too soon than a year too late.  Players are going to go to teams that can win, or pay more well before they worry about loyalty.    Now if you want to say it was a risk on a player that was great in the past, that's a little better IMO.   I think that is more of what DL was doing, and it didn't pan out."

losangeleskings,33iiez,crass_bonanza,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:15:23 2015 UTC,I don't think Richards will be bought out.  The buyout hit in 2 years will be 4+ and I don't see Lombardi going that route unless we are ready for a rebuild.  The only way I see it is if the NHL approves another conditional buy out due to the cap falling so drastically.

losangeleskings,33etuh,RubeusShagrid,6,Tue Apr 21 23:09:33 2015 UTC,They'll probably give to datsyuk because east coast. Kopi is definitely deserving. Let's hope Dewey gets the recognition he deserves and gets a Norris nomination(and hopefully wins)
losangeleskings,33etuh,nenright,2,Wed Apr 22 01:28:25 2015 UTC,Datsyuk won it four years in a row recently. Pass the torch already :(
losangeleskings,33etuh,ScottVGun,2,Wed Apr 22 01:41:20 2015 UTC,Drew didn't have a Norris worthy year at all...
losangeleskings,33etuh,nenright,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:40:43 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Drew is the best defenseman in the NHL, and even if he had an ""off"" season(he had more points than he has had in almost every other year he's been in the league, which is what the voters mainly look at), his all around game and his ridiculous 29 minutes per game deserve at least a nomination"
losangeleskings,33etuh,ScottVGun,3,Wed Apr 22 18:40:55 2015 UTC,The issue is voters don't go for mins per game..they look at stats and then call it a day.  It sucks but its a reality
losangeleskings,33etuh,SoloSkeptik,7,Wed Apr 22 18:41:56 2015 UTC,Yeah.. my thoughts are GO KOPI!!!
losangeleskings,33etuh,heyitsEnricoPallazzo,3,Tue Apr 21 23:13:45 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I guess my thoughts are: congratulations to Pavel Datsyuk on winning the Lady Byng. Again."
losangeleskings,33etuh,doot_doot,4,Wed Apr 22 16:19:03 2015 UTC,Kopi deserves it. Pure class right there.
losangeleskings,33etuh,ScottVGun,2,Wed Apr 22 00:26:07 2015 UTC,"It's a nice gesture.  He's not going to win, but still it's nice."

losangeleskings,33hwgf,Ghost00,15,Wed Apr 22 17:33:18 2015 UTC,I really don't think last year was a leadership issue. If you really look at it we kind of did the same thing we do every year except there was 2 teams hanging around the last few playoff spots that aren't normally there. I really don't think we need to shake up anything too much. Hopefully the guys learned that the waiting till the last 2 months to play hockey trick isn't going to work anymore.
losangeleskings,33hwgf,KingsfanMDJ,8,Wed Apr 22 17:47:44 2015 UTC,The only thing Brownie needs to improve on is a few more goals in the regular season--other than that he is a perfect captain for us. But if for some reason we lose Greener I could see Doughty take the A--or Williams if we can keep him.
losangeleskings,33hwgf,CrispyLardon,7,Wed Apr 22 18:07:21 2015 UTC,nope he stays.
losangeleskings,33hwgf,thegetawayplan9,11,Wed Apr 22 17:56:20 2015 UTC,Why would he not be the captain? He's perfect
losangeleskings,33hwgf,Sniffman,4,Wed Apr 22 17:57:47 2015 UTC,Just asking opinions. Sub is dead right now. :(
losangeleskings,33hwgf,thegetawayplan9,5,Wed Apr 22 17:59:29 2015 UTC,You'll be dead if you keep trying to take brown's C away... (Kidding)

In a sense although I understand the merit of like your best guy or one of them wearing the C I do kind of like that Kopitar or Doughty don't. There is less to be distracted by.  We have a pretty good family mentality [we win and fail all together at the same time these past seasons which might not be the best but hey everyone pertaining to the game seems to be a team effort] and everyone seems to take care of each other here and there.   Let Brown continue to chirp and hit and be the captain. Let Kopitar try and focus more on his scoring, let the other forwards follow suit and lets let our defense remember how to defend.  I'm really hoping to see everyone relax for a while and then pick up and do what they need to. Stamina working. Could you imagine if we could play something a step closer to play off hockey throughout most of the reason?"
losangeleskings,33hwgf,crass_bonanza,4,Wed Apr 22 22:12:52 2015 UTC,I would probably stick with the only active player to captain a team that won 2 cups in 3 years.
losangeleskings,33hwgf,KingsfanMDJ,2,Wed Apr 22 23:16:18 2015 UTC,That's just crazy talk.
losangeleskings,33hwgf,QuickerThanFasth,2,Fri Apr 24 18:04:37 2015 UTC,I think he stays
losangeleskings,33hwgf,Jericho111091,2,Wed Apr 22 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"he could stand to score a bit more, but beyond that he was pretty good, I see no need to take the C from him."
losangeleskings,33hwgf,zattk94,2,Wed Apr 22 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"He's fine as the C but he's described as the ""leads by his play not vocally"" type of guy. So he needs to produce a hell of a lot more than the past two years, because he's getting payed a lot of money to score 20 points a season which is not ok"
losangeleskings,33hwgf,Pen2Paper,2,Wed Apr 22 20:02:24 2015 UTC,I think he should stay. Two cups and all that.
losangeleskings,33hwgf,rockkon,2,Thu Apr 23 01:07:13 2015 UTC,If it wasn't unanimous by 2013 then it's pretty obvious even now no one on our team could wear the C better.
losangeleskings,33hwgf,KingsfanMDJ,-4,Sat Apr 25 00:00:41 2015 UTC,"There needs to be another culture change.  Offense comes to LA to die in sunny weather.  For the last five years Kopi has been the scoring leader on the team yet he has never had a point per game season.    For the last five years Kopi has been 20th, 17th, 28th, 17th, and 34th in scoring in the entire NHL.  Meaning that LA has never had a player in the top ten in scoring for the last five years.  Not even the top 15.  I don't think it is because of the system or the coaching.  I think there is a culture that guarantees the Kopi is the team's scoring leader and anyone who challenges that is labeled as selfish.  That's the culture of the room and that needs to be changed.  Take the A from Matt Greene and take the C from Brown."

losangeleskings,33cvyl,holeysheets,2,Wed Apr 22 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"But that's a lot different, because not that many kings fans pay attention to the red wings(I don't).

I know Voynov is innocent until proven guilty and up until his arrest was a solid defender but if he can't play it's hard to find a reason to keep him. That isn't even taking into consideration if he is guilty, if he really did beat his wife then I don't care how good he is.  I really don't even know what to say about Richards, he came back worse then when he was sent down to Manchester. Stoll really hasn't done much either.  I'm not really sure what the league/team wants or will do with Stoll after this so I guess that remains to be seen. I imagine they will wait until the DA decides what to do."

losangeleskings,3361n7,Never_Kn0ws_Best,2,Mon Apr 20 14:10:59 2015 UTC,"The skill range in people at this clinic is fairly wide (as far as beginners go), I feel I'm probably on the upper end skill wise. I bought my skates in december and have been skating 1-3 times a week as well as going through an entire beginner skating class (I finished in March). In addition I've played a couple of pick-up games and done stick and puck sessions a few times since getting my gear.  With that said there are some people there who have never skated by the looks of it or are just starting out. If you're going in June I'd say start skating now, you'll learn stuff no matter what but I think you will probably get more out of it if you have worked on skating before hand."

losangeleskings,3361n7,cantremembr,2,Mon Apr 20 21:32:19 2015 UTC,You could also get a dry land training stick and a stick handling ball or green biscuit and practice off ice. All practice helps and you can never spend too much time working on your stick handling. I would also recommend checking out the stuff on /r/HockeyPlayers (they have a ton of resources on the side bar).

losangeleskings,332w2d,RubyRhod,3,Sun Apr 19 15:51:14 2015 UTC,well a blue line isnt going to help them much when their forwards are cheating at break aways any chance they get. I think they would be better off teaching their young forwards to play two ways than getting a defensemen who is going to constantly get burned because of forwards not helping out.
losangeleskings,332w2d,RobOneXL,3,Sun Apr 19 05:28:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of that comes from coaches who think their best chance of winning is having their star forwards cherry pick, but that's common of a lot speedy teams -- get scoring opportunities with stretch passes through the neutral zone.  They see Chicago and New York being successful with it, but Edmonton forgets that those two successful franchises also play responsible D.  Until they start teaching that with their players, Edmonton will continue to be eligible for first overall picks for years to come."
losangeleskings,332w2d,wiseaus_stunt_double,13,Sun Apr 19 06:36:13 2015 UTC,Oilers. What a load of bullshit. I would rather see the Sharks draft McDavid. Oilers dont deserve him at all

losangeleskings,332w2d,TheFantasticFinn,23,Sun Apr 19 00:31:33 2015 UTC,I'd like to see the Sharks wallow at the bottom for a decade or so. It'll  build character in their fan base.
losangeleskings,332w2d,TheFantasticFinn,7,Sun Apr 19 00:31:23 2015 UTC,"As a Sharks fan I occasionally browse /r/losangeleskings because I'm jealous of your recent success, what do you mean by ""build character in their fan base"" ?  From my experience (only the internet and a few weeks in the Bay area since I'm a Finn), Sharks fans are very passionate and love the Sharks even though the Sharks have been disappointing us in the playoffs for a long time."
losangeleskings,332w2d,Pen2Paper,4,Sun Apr 19 09:24:33 2015 UTC,"The Sharks are an extraordinarily good team. In general, they always have been.  In the Sharks history, I think they've missed the playoffs six times. And they don't just squeak by. They've won the division six times and taken 2nd many times. As a result, post season play isn't something a Sharks fan hopes for. It's something they expect. It's the norm.   Sharks fans don't know what it's like to only hope for a post season. They certainly don't know what it's like to know in January that their team is effectively out of the playoffs, and not just one year, but season after season.  Yeah... it sucks to have a disappointing playoff history, but it could be so much worse than that."
losangeleskings,332w2d,Pen2Paper,6,Sun Apr 19 15:48:53 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Thanks for taking your time to clarify it.  Looking forward till next season!

It's a good lesson for Kings fans. We started the season expecting a playoff spot, and ended hoping for one.   So... playoffs next year, yeah... I'm hopeful again."

Obviously his size makes him attractive for a lot of teams. He's projected to go 8th though, so he would have to drop or the Kings would probably have to give something up to move up - probably not worth it unless they really believe in him."

Dean Lombardi starts to build a winning culture with help from some Dav Taylor (previous GM) draft picks like Brownie, Kopi, and Quickie. He drafts his own players that are now massively important like Dewy, Marty, and American Hero Trevor Lewis. He made some massive trades in 11-12 for Mike Richards and Jeff Carter to facilitate that first Cup run. Last season the trade for Gabby was huge, and the rest is really history. tl;dr the 30 for 30 Kings Ransom and the 2 championship videos do a good job about hitting the important stuff."

He can start working directly with the Kings organization for his development. The same goes for Adrian Kempe except he's younger having only turned 19 a few months ago, was playing in the Swedish Hockey League the top league in Sweden (which is insane for an 18 year old) so he is over here to get in that much more time on NHL sized ice playing the Kings system and North American hockey in general.

If not I think Weal should be brought up and have a rotation battle with Richards for the 4th line center. Shore will take Stolls spot as 3rd line center.

losangeleskings,32vkj6,RubyRhod,3,Fri Apr 17 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"Stoll, Williams and Sekera are probably the biggest mysteries. I know Toffoli is another potential loss but based on his production this year I really don't see LA letting him leave without making a sizable offer to keep him.  I'm personally worried that we've seen the last of Justin Williams, he didn't have that great of a season but his playoff experience and leadership are something a lot of other teams would perhaps want. LA's cap situation is going to be in a bad place until the Voynov situation is resolved.  I think with how suspect LA's defense has been, keeping Andrej Sekera is probably worth the loss of both Stoll and Williams. I say that with a heavy heart as Williams is one of my favorite LA players but Sekera was a great addition to LA who was really starting to mesh well with the Kings system before his injury.  I suppose if LA can keep Toffoli and Sekera while losing Williams and Stoll that would probably be the best overall move (I haven't checked how feasible this would be with LA's salary cap). Stoll can easily be replaced with Nick Shore who hasn't done much as far as points go,  but has a tremendous faceoff win percentage and would be a much better center for the 4th line than Stoll.  I'm hoping DL can figure out something for what can only be described as The Richards Situation, I know Richards gets a lot of hate and I have to admit that as of right now it feels kind of warranted. He has been an asset to the team in the past but as of right now he is dead weight. When he returned from his time with the Monarchs he looked like he could barely keep his skates under him, that kind of play in the NHL is embarassing to say the least.  Maybe Richards spends the summer fixing whatever is wrong with him and he becomes a value added player, that would be great. However, if he isn't going to bring something then maybe DL needs to look for a buyout or something like that, Richards is really holding this team back as of late.  I think next year will be interesting to watch, a rested and refreshed team with some new blood and a little less fat could be an absolute terror for the rest of NHL, I guess we'll see what the draft brings (the coming of King Connor and the implosion of /r/hockey?, very unlikely but so beautiful to dream about)."
losangeleskings,32vkj6,EinsamWulf,5,Fri Apr 17 15:12:35 2015 UTC,No way in hell we lose Toffoli.
losangeleskings,32vkj6,LAKingBob,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:05:58 2015 UTC,Given some of the offensive troubles LA has had this year I sincerely doubt it. I suppose it could happen due to constraints brought on by the Salary Cap but my thinking is that based on his production the chances of him leaving LA are pretty slim albeit not impossible.
losangeleskings,32vkj6,RubyRhod,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"I agree but with the Kings cap situation with Richards and Voynov still hanging over the Kings' heads, it's starting to look like a possibility.    The Kings aren't going to be able to take care of Voynov's situation until his trial ends and no one wants Richard's contract without taking one of the Kings' young blood i.e. Toffoli.  It's going to be an interesting off-season"
losangeleskings,32vkj6,dalbtraps,3,Fri Apr 17 17:24:48 2015 UTC,I assume we buy out Richards and take the hit and Toffoli signs a bridge contract.
losangeleskings,32vkj6,EinsamWulf,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:32:43 2015 UTC,"The cap hit on Richards down the line is pretty substantial (around 4 mil per season), but the cap will probably keep going up as long as the NHL rebounds in popularity so hopefully it won't feel as big. I feel like Richards and Voynov are just a big distraction and 2 of the biggest reasons why the Kings missed the playoffs this year."
losangeleskings,32vkj6,LAKingBob,2,Fri Apr 17 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"2 of the biggest reasons why the Kings missed the playoffs this year   Honestly the Kings (not counting Voynov and Richards) are the reason they missed the playoffs. Their road record early in the season, the OT losses, defensive breakdowns etc. were the real culprit and while it can be argued that Voynov would have helped defensively I think it's larger than that, all the pairings did not function well this year.  The Kings had a chance to fight back and just couldn't do it, they absolutely blew that game in Calgary. They're a heavy forechecking team that didn't forecheck until maybe halfway through the 2nd period. We can probably chock some of their troubles up to fatigue and it probably sounds like I'm totally down on this team but I'm really not.   They've all got the hearts of champions but you can't always wins and sometimes shit just doesn't go your way. It sucks but with the season over they can use the summer to get things ready for next season. Hopefully they find a way to deal with Voynov and Richards while at the same time keeping the players they need.  I have this feeling next year will be very exciting to watch. For now I can watch the playoffs free of stress, my liver is probably happy about that."
losangeleskings,32vkj6,EinsamWulf,2,Fri Apr 17 20:31:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed, agreed, agreed.  I dislike how people keep blaming Voynov (at moments I did too) for all the Kings failures this season.  They had so many moments to make playoffs but kept blowing it (i.e. the last Oilers game and ESPECIALLY the last Flames game).  But whatever, what's done is done.  They were one of the biggest threats starting the season, they just have to play like it."

I think Sekera is still up in the air. It seems like Gaborik is making LA look appealing to him but Sekera left the Hurricanes for more money, money the team doesn't have.  He might have be more willing to take a discount if the team was more successful this season.  Toffoli may leave for more money but there's a better chance he'll be more willing to take a cap discount instead of Sekera.   I don't expect Richards to leave as no team wants his contract.  When he came back this season, he was pretty much invisible to me.  Sure he didn't make any crucial mistakes/penalties but I heard he looked like a junior player in a NHL game.  Seeing how the NHL has treated the Voynov situation this season, I don't think we will get an answer by the trade deadline.  Most likely we'll be bound by Voynov's cap hit :/."
losangeleskings,32vkj6,nickmakhno,11,Fri Apr 17 02:24:45 2015 UTC,No way Toffoli is not a King next season.

Which is total bullshit.   You like a team, you support your team, who cares about the owner. I'm a sad Redskins fan (don't ask) and I think we have the absolute worst owner in professional sports but it doesn't stop me from still supporting the players on the field.

There's lots more reasons to be annoyed by other fan bases. This isn't one of them."
losangeleskings,32undm,BumDiddy,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. I don't give a fuck what anyone else is doing. I root for the Kings because in my eyes, they are the best hockey team on the Earth, and I am so proud to be a fan of them. I don't give a fuck if we won the Cup last year and aren't competing for it this year. I don't give a fuck if Slava beat his wife or Jarrett Stoll got arrested for possession (I'm straight edge for context).   I am a fan of this team, not a fan of the Cup. I'm a fan of the Kings, not a ring chaser."

losangeleskings,32tbom,wiseaus_stunt_double,8,Thu Apr 16 15:29:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I feel that the team needs to win the Stanley Cup every year but the fact that the culture within the organization has that mind set is good to say the least. Coming off of last years win I knew that another win was very unlikely in the post salary cap era but I would be lying if I said it was disappointing that LA wouldn't make the playoffs.  At this point all the team can do is take some time to rest (they've certainly earned it) and get ready for October. The leadership has some work to do over the summer with figuring out which of our Free agents to keep, the Voynov situation and making sure the weaknesses within the team are addressed prior to the game opener.  Is it October yet?"

losangeleskings,32kom8,EinsamWulf,5,Tue Apr 14 17:26:33 2015 UTC,The best cognitive dissonance of the last few days has been most of /r/hockey going apeshit that the Kings got eliminated from the playoffs because they were all scared they'd get rekt...followed by most of /r/hockey going apeshit because the power rankings at NHL.com had the Kings ranked highly.

He also mentions Zykov could join Manchester in the playoffs if his QMJHL team exits the playoffs too. Manchester will be a beast in the playoffs this year."

losangeleskings,32khg5,EinsamWulf,6,Tue Apr 14 15:27:09 2015 UTC,Another fun fact - Kopitar made his way through the SEL as well. Not to say that Kempe's ceiling is similar.
losangeleskings,32khg5,bryan_sensei,4,Tue Apr 14 15:45:45 2015 UTC,Hopefully he does well with the Monarchs and then the Reign next season when they move. Hopefully we see him soon.

losangeleskings,32khg5,banksy_,4,Tue Apr 14 17:08:50 2015 UTC,The little I saw of him at the World Juniors left me happy. It's good to see he's coming over- he'll need some time to marinate in the AHL just like his buddy Nylander.

losangeleskings,32hozm,LAKingBob,6,Mon Apr 13 21:56:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing this link!   I wonder why they didn't really talk about William's possible departure and focused more on Stoll.  On another note, I thought Sutter's comment about players potentially leaving the Kings was pretty heart felt. I had a lump stuck in my throat just reading that"
losangeleskings,32hozm,FreakAss,6,Mon Apr 13 23:05:18 2015 UTC,This makes me sad
losangeleskings,32hozm,blueliner17,3,Mon Apr 13 23:16:41 2015 UTC,Me too. At the very least I hope they can take Williams cap money and use it to sign Sekera.
losangeleskings,32hozm,EinsamWulf,1 point,Tue Apr 14 06:51:59 2015 UTC,"I would be ok with that. Not that I don't want Williams to stay because I do, hell I tape the handle of my Hockey stick purple and I have one of his signed Stanley Cup pucks.   With that said if we had to give him up for someone I think Sekera is a solid choice, he really came into his own and can really add some defensive depth that LA has been missing since we lost Voynov."
losangeleskings,32hozm,Omnivirus,5,Tue Apr 14 16:09:45 2015 UTC,"I think most of the regret comes because they knew they fucked up this year, and that will be the trigger for losing a Williams and a Stoll. If they had made the playoffs and made another deep run, there was probably a very good chance that DL re-signs them both, possibly hemming us in even more than we already are with the cap.  I love them for what they did for us, but I'm also breathing a little bit of a sigh of relief that it looks like both are going to move on. I'd rather remember them how I do now than be bitching about them next year and moving forward. Stoll was already leaving a sour taste."
losangeleskings,32hozm,blueliner17,2,Tue Apr 14 02:25:39 2015 UTC,I disagree. The Kings just don't have enough cap space to give Williams the retirement contract he deserves (like Mitchell got in Florida)
losangeleskings,32hozm,WoozleWuzzle,6,Tue Apr 14 06:54:18 2015 UTC,It's easier to lose players when you win a cup than this way. The 2015 - 2016 Kings are going to look much different. 😨
losangeleskings,32hozm,BiohazardPixie,3,Tue Apr 14 01:20:53 2015 UTC,I'm glad to see all of the guys speaking up and having good things to say about each other but daaang if it isn't depressing :(
losangeleskings,32hozm,krucz36,2,Mon Apr 13 23:27:59 2015 UTC,"Not looking forward to any of the gang moving on but it has to happen. The core is still there and it's strong...I look for Toffoli and Pearson to have gigantic years next season barring injury of course. and I think Nick Shore makes a big leap too, if he hasn't already.   Success is this sport is measured in tiny margins. Let's hope they continue their alternating-years thing!"
losangeleskings,32hozm,KobeBasedGod24,2,Tue Apr 14 07:06:12 2015 UTC,"It will suck losing these guys, but like they said, its a business. Our core is still intact. It will suck losing Williams a lot more than Stoll, but both guys brought their own skill to the team. I do wish Williams would stick around, but he has to look out for himself and his family. I'm sure he will get a fat contract like Willie Mitchell. Williams will probably going to a young team, and he will have that veteran leadership. Wherever he will end up, he will always have my support. I'm going to miss him being on our team. But the time has come to move on."

losangeleskings,32g03l,mxman991,12,Mon Apr 13 14:23:07 2015 UTC,"Call me a homer, but I think even with how many injuries we had, and critical loses in OT, I think our team did pretty well. We may not have made the Playoffs this year, but we were a few stupid shoot outs away from doing it. If anything, it highlights to me how much the OT format needs to change."
losangeleskings,32g03l,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:24:08 2015 UTC,To be honest I think the overtime format does in fact need to change but I think the Kings were personally protesting the shootout. A great example was the last game against the Sharks (and any breakaway even) showed to me that they can handle the puck extremely well and deke but they just refuse to during the shootout. You don't just go down the slot and shoot wristers every single time. In the end it ended up costing the Kings but hopefully the extra two months of offseason they'll practice.
losangeleskings,32g03l,MagicArc,6,Tue Apr 14 13:31:15 2015 UTC,"I don't care for the title, but the analysis is interesting."
losangeleskings,32g03l,Pachurick,7,Mon Apr 13 14:27:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, don't know if the title accurately represents the Kings.  ""Chumps"" would imply last place in my book.  I think any other team would crumble with 1 or 2 of these things occurring, let alone all 6 in one season."
losangeleskings,32g03l,Lolmoqz,3,Mon Apr 13 15:50:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, I dont think ""chumps"" is an accurate depiction of our current state. Looking forward to next season, I dont see us falling far off the West coast race if any at all. The Kings have a known history of scrapping into playoffs and then showing up to play good hockey once inside. Theres no argument in stating that the west coast is an extremely tight and tough division, and with such circumstances stances and our history of making playoffs, a season can vastly sway in or out of your favor within a game or so. Remember, the Sharks are in the same boat as us right now by not making it yet without a championship behind them they have seem to fly under this ""chump"" radar. I wouldn't count them out the same as the Kings. I think its too early to make such assumptions. A year or two will hold much more truth and accuracy, but my opinion is that the Kings still have a demanding presence on the rink and if teams mistake it for ""chumps"" they will have a rude eye opening experience."
losangeleskings,32g03l,Omnivirus,6,Mon Apr 13 17:30:12 2015 UTC,Whoever watched the games during the season heard one of these reasons every day. I know these like the back of my hand. Sucks but it's true. This season was just bad with some horrible luck. Little bit worse luck than previous seasons 😕
losangeleskings,32g03l,RubyRhod,6,Mon Apr 13 15:06:44 2015 UTC,"The thing that stood out for me was the frequency that the Kings allowed a goal in the first five shots, not to mention all the times they allowed two (sometimes three!) goals in the first ten shots."
losangeleskings,32g03l,TheGarreth,5,Mon Apr 13 15:10:11 2015 UTC,"Can't see anything wrong with what he wrote. I still believe ultimately that keeping Richards is the first move that rippled everything outwards from there.  Because we kept Richards, we let go of Mitchell. When Voynov f'd up, or AMart or Regehr got injured, we didn't have the defensive depth to compensate and were forced to use AHL calibre players in roles they definitely were not ready for, or NHL players in much more intensive minutes they couldn't handle. It's no surprise in this context that we couldn't hold leads and didn't do nearly as well in 1-goal games.  Because we kept Richards, we were hamstrung when it came to bringing up players when injuries hit other parts of the team as well. So much money tied up in a 'key' piece that did nothing.  I guess you could say I'm not a Mike Richards fan right about this moment.  What I would like to see is some sort of revamp of our offensive system next year- keeping the cycling, but playing a bit more to the creative strength of our team. We've got guys like Gaborik, Kopi, Carter, Toffoli, Pearson...yet we play an offensive style more suited to guys like Brown, Williams, and Mike Richards (old version)."

losangeleskings,32ean0,Wooblez,15,Mon Apr 13 02:09:20 2015 UTC,"I think a major issue was losing Voynov. We lost arguably the second best defenseman on the team, and were stuck paying him. Tied up a lot of money and some a lot of skill was taken off the roster. Part of me hopes everything is resolved and that the NHL voids his contract fairly quickly. I love how talented he is, but when you put yourself in the situation he has, I have no sympathy and I think the locker room would be better off not having to adjust to him being back after this happened. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but it's really hard with the evidence, and the culture he came from.  It really didn't help having Pearson go down either. Was horrible having to see a kid that was about to make a name for himself in the NHL go down on a flukey injury, kind of like Hertl.  It just allows the team some extended time to recover and rest, and to drop some of the really shitty ""fans"" that have popped up the last couple years. We will get you guys next year. :D"
losangeleskings,32ean0,hopesfail,5,Mon Apr 13 03:46:33 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with the Voynov statement. He left a huge hole in our defense and took up a nice chunk of cap space for the first half of our season.  As great of a player as he might have been, there should be no room in our organization for shit like that.  I dodged a bullet when I bought a new nameless jersey at the end of last season. I was so close to buying Voynov."
losangeleskings,32ean0,Illegal_Tender,2,Mon Apr 13 04:31:49 2015 UTC,"I think the whole voynov thing shifted the locker room vibe. Not only was it an unexpected loss, but responsibilities shifted and I think that messed us up for the most part :/"
losangeleskings,32ean0,Lolmoqz,3,Mon Apr 13 08:16:32 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I think the loss of Voynov as well as the added drama that it brought caused early issues which by the end of the season cost us.  That paired with the loss of Willie Mitchell really depleted our D.  Key injuries to Amartz and Big Rig depleted the blue line even further.  This is only more evident by the lack of success on the penalty kill and the TOI of Dewey.  Quick was forced to work even harder than normal to make up for the struggling D and that teamed with the lack of success caused him mental stress.   It just compounded down the line.  Lets get healthy (70), shed the extra weight (10 & 26), resign those needed (73, 14) and wish the best to those leaving us (44, 28) and have a great 2015-2016 season and bring home another banner.

I've been really into it only since that season and if not for them it might have taken me till 2012 if not for them so I have good feelings for the Ducks even though Fuck the Ducks.

We're all here for the same purpose, and that is we all love the game of Hockey. We all live our daily lives outside of /r/hockey and we shouldn't have to let our anger out on someone because they're wearing a flair that you hate. But yeah, I will always defend a Kings flair until the end(or if it includes the Avs-Kings, then I'm on the Avs). But yeah GKG and hopefully we both get better and make the Playoffs. It would be fucking awesome to meet in the WCF."
losangeleskings,32eava,hopesfail,2,Mon Apr 13 03:47:59 2015 UTC,It was a pleasure having you here Pika! This user draft thing was an amazing thing because it brought some really amazing users like yourself here.  If the Internet could use more of it's humanizing things like this. Instead of looking at someone as just a different flair you get to know the person behind it and share a love for the game. You're always welcome here and hope the Avs have good luck next year!
losangeleskings,32eava,paranoidpikachu,3,Mon Apr 13 03:40:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks, hopefully we can do this again next season. It was a fun experience and I wouldn't mind coming back here opand sporting the Kings flair on /r/Hockey again.  Exactly, I'm an Avs Fan first, but a Hockey fan too. I met a few Kings Redditors(/u/wiseaus_stunt_double and /u/Destillat) when I was out at Staples for the Kings-Canes game and they were pretty awesome people. I will probably drop on by once in a while and Hopefully we can both make it into the Playoffs next season. It was a fun experience. Go Avs and GKG!"

I will always support the Kings, unless they play the Avs.   Thanks again and hopefully you have Happiness and more karma points towards yourself as well.  Go Avs and GKG!!!"

losangeleskings,32d34w,boltsteve,11,Sun Apr 12 20:09:55 2015 UTC,I think you're correct. That could have also been Williams last game as a King so he could have been a little more emotional.

losangeleskings,32d6wf,EricBurger,16,Sun Apr 12 20:26:21 2015 UTC,From some of Rosen's other tweets it seems that the players did this as a way of taking charge and leading themselves. This was the start of an 8 game win streak. Maybe they were frustrated with Sutter (it isn't surprising that players would get frustrated but I don't think it's telling of some endemic problem) but Dean Lombardi was happy to see them take charge.  Sometimes a leader has to be that hard antagonistic force that bonds a team together. I saw it in the military and it does work. Unless there is more we don't know I don't think this is anything serious.

losangeleskings,32d6wf,kaufsky,8,Sun Apr 12 20:38:25 2015 UTC,Emotions can run high and we don't have all the details about what happened but if I remember the game against Tampa was the start of a win streak. Hopefully it's a water under the bridge thing now.
losangeleskings,32d6wf,EinsamWulf,7,Sun Apr 12 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"Eh. I don't know if I'm thinking of these as locker room issues. I mean I can certainly see frustration but the first, reading all of these and taking into note that the players seemed to say everything was fine, thing I thought of was Willie Mitchell.  When he had been asked about Sutter after going to the Panthers he very honestly said there were a LOT of times he hated the man but that he knew what he was doing and was a great coach.  I would find it more far fetched to imagine the others didn't share the mindset than to imagine that they do.  A coach is kind of like a parent in a way. In most cases the best parents aren't the ones who are your best friend [the ones who can manage the friendship and relaxed relationship and the actual parenting part though are amazing but rare] and that is kind of how I imagine a coach is.  You're not going to love and agree with the person who is the one who will point out your faults all the time. If it escalates and becomes a large and public recurring issue I will start to panic, though."
losangeleskings,32d6wf,BiohazardPixie,3,Sun Apr 12 23:31:05 2015 UTC,"As a 49er and Kings fan, I don't think I will be able to handle another great coach being pushed out.

Whatever happened, they went on an 8 game tear, so they got something bad out and refocused."

losangeleskings,32dmku,chasej805,14,Sun Apr 12 22:36:36 2015 UTC,"I believe we have about $13M to work with if Voynov is gone and Richards gets sent down. $11.2M if Richards is bought out. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.  Toffoli is 100% top priority so he has to get signed first. I'd think something like 2.5 to 3.5 for him. Though maybe he takes a bridge deal like Pearson.  That leaves us with about $10M left for Sekera, Williams, Stoll, McBain, and Jones.  Stoll probably goes and so does McBain so that leaves Sekera, Stoll, and Jones. I really hope Sekera signs with us since that trade would be a pretty big waste if he doesn't. So maybe 2.5 to 3 for him.  I'm probably being hopeful but maybe Jones takes a low deal. Something like 1.5 to 2.  That leaves us with about $3M left for Williams which basically means if he likes playing here more than he likes money he stays but if he doesn't, which I'd understand, then he's gone. I really hope it's the former because I want him here next season.  I'm also really hoping we can get Kopitar on an extension as soon as July rolls around. I do not want that worry hanging over our heads next year.  Keep in mind I am no GM outside of the EA NHL games so maybe this is all garbage but that sounds pretty ok to me."
losangeleskings,32dmku,hobonia,7,Sun Apr 12 22:59:36 2015 UTC,"Sekera is seeking around 5 mil in FA, no way we sign him for anything under 4 mil."
losangeleskings,32dmku,Anewman1188,3,Sun Apr 12 23:28:06 2015 UTC,Which might be doable if Toffoli is willing to take something lower for a couple years like Pearson did.  I just really want him back. Giving up a 1st round pick for a rental when we didn't make the playoffs would not be fun.  There's a part of me that's aware it might come down to Sekera or Williams and I'm trying to ignore it right now.
losangeleskings,32dmku,hobonia,2,Sun Apr 12 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"If it comes down to Sekera OR Williams, the choice is so easy it's laughable."

Thenmaybe we'd see a more consistent level of play from him. My understanding regarding the Richards situation was part of the problem with Richards was that he was being played as a 4th line center and didn't feel that he was 4th line center material? Anyone have more insight on that?

losangeleskings,32dmku,hobonia,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"Totally agree that his salary hit hurts our cap. But I also think they gave him that contract for a reason (Even if it was ridiculous). If you look at his accomplishments as a player I think they speak for themselves. Only player to win a memorial cup, calder cup, stanley cup, world juniors gold medal, and an olympic gold medal. He was also the Flyer's team captain, and I believe 1st or 2nd line center. I'm not pointing this out to suck the guys dick, rather to point out that he's proven he's capable of winning at any level, and until this year, was used to being received with more respect than being relegated to a 4th line center, playing barely 10 minutes a game. If he can bring back the magic that made both the '10 flyers and the '14 Kings pull a 4-3 comeback, then I say he's worth the money, as opposed to pissing 5.8 million into the wind."
losangeleskings,32dmku,RayPinchiks,2,Mon Apr 13 05:41:42 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that when Philly signed him he was one hell of a player and he's definitely done a lot for us but is he really still capable of being the player he was? I'm not too sure at this point.  I don't blame him for it either, I think that concussion (against Chicago I think) a few years back really affected him. It might just be that the injury got the best of him and he's not capable anymore.  But as I said I still like  and respect him and I really wish we could keep him. I'd gladly eat my words if he stayed in LA next season and tore it up but I think the team is gonna have to make a decision before October and, whether that means buying him out or sending him down, I get the feeling the feeling he won't start the season on the LA roster."
losangeleskings,32dmku,hobonia,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:03:39 2015 UTC,Can't agree. He got his contract because he was a young leader who was physical and could put up 60 points minimum per year.   He's borderline a 'leader' now and the rest of his game is shot. Time to let him try and put the pieces back together somewhere else.
losangeleskings,32dmku,Omnivirus,9,Mon Apr 13 12:54:43 2015 UTC,"I think Richards will be used as a pawn to get something from another team.   Given that nobody would even claim him off waivers, it's more likely we'd have to trade one of our prospects/players as a pawn to get someone to take Richards."
losangeleskings,32dmku,Fuzzy901,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:51:51 2015 UTC,At this point I'd trade him for a 4th rounder and Nick Deslauries back from Buffalo. He's a turnover machine who has lost his touch with the puck. Going to a team like Buffalo gives him playing time and a guy to mentor McEichel.
losangeleskings,32dmku,Pen2Paper,6,Mon Apr 13 06:05:55 2015 UTC,"Toffoli is priority 1.  I'd put Sekera as priority 2, since Regehr just retired and I assume Voynov is gone.  Stoll is a very low priority, Shore is a decent YOUNG replacement.  Williams is gonna be tough, would need him to sign at a discount.  I guess as much as it hurts I'd let him go...better a year too soon than a year too late. See for example Mike Richards, who we are stuck with for better or worse.  McBain is a league minimum player so we can keep him if we want him."

losangeleskings,32dmku,MagicArc,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:26:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed with most, Toff #1, getting Seks a close #2.  Stoll is on his way, he grabbed the game puck on Saturday for ""himself.""  Typically a sign a player knows they're done.  Jones will resign cheap if he wants to stay a King...otherwise we have depth in AHL.  McBain was a rental.  Williams will get an offer, but it will be up to him whether or not he decides to stay a King.  If he wants too much for too longer there's plenty of younger guys who can take that spot.  I think we'll lock Kopi down once we know what's going on with Voynov."

With Regehr hanging 'em up, we need a solid Defensive defensman or two. Now, I haven't seen him play much... but I am under the impression he is more of an offensive defenseman. So it may be better to attempt a trade, possibly? I don't know. If he wants 5kk, that's not nothing.  Richards - if a team wants him, we'll likely deal him. There has to be some level of bad blood here. And, sadly, he hasn't looked great at the NHL level after coming back up. If we can get value out of him, we likely will.   Stoll - I don't know here. His concussion is pause for concern. I'm not sure on numbers, but he still is one of the best at face-offs, and he does go a bit ""balls to the wall,"" which is largely what this team is about. I think if they can reasonably sign him, they will.   Jones - Has shown that he can help out when Quick needs a break. Not sure if there's another goalie in the works that we'd like to get time to, but I'd say we try to keep him.  Williams - Still solid. If they can sign him, they'd definitely do so, but may also part ways due to lack of cap.   Toffoli - Definitely sign here. Young and already solid. This would be priority. Hopefully, we can get something done similar to Pearson (may be tougher because Pearson deal was done when he was injured... and thus he was more likely to take a lower deal, 'cause of the ""never know"" factor).   Also, for those that may not know... Voynov's rights were traded to Philadelphia. Not sure of the full deal (if we retain cap hit, etc), but that happened before trade deadline."
losangeleskings,32dmku,pikay93,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:41:59 2015 UTC,Hopefully Toffoli & Sekera at least. Does anyone know when they typically start pre-season roster moves?
losangeleskings,32f5sj,trixxyhobbitses,13,Mon Apr 13 08:04:50 2015 UTC,Short answer: No  Long answer: Nooooooooooooooooooooo  We're fine. Sky is not falling. Media is overblowing shit. Williams just might be a little emotional after what may be his last game as a King. Stop worrying.
losangeleskings,32f5sj,GaboKopiBrown,6,Mon Apr 13 09:41:16 2015 UTC,The Kings tallied 95 points. The same when they made the playoffs in 2012.  No.
losangeleskings,32f5sj,hopesfail,2,Mon Apr 13 20:13:52 2015 UTC,"The players only meeting is not a big deal. If it would have been at a practice or something it would have been an after thought, or had they made the playoffs no issue would have been made. I've been involved in 2 situations where a coach was locked out of a locker room. First coach was irate, second coach was younger and knew there were things that had to be said/handled within the team. Both times it left the team in a better place as a whole, even if there were a couple guys who didn't like hearing what needed to be said. No one mentioned the meetings after with coach 2 and we moved on. With coach 1 no one would talk and we did a lot of conditioning as punishment.  The Kopi/Williams thing you can't know what's going on. With Kopi facing away you can't tell if he's smiling and trying to rustle Williams' hair, or if he's straight faced and kind of being an asshole. Really, Williams is probably going to get paid in his last big contract somewhere else, and it won't matter next year."
losangeleskings,32f5sj,thegetawayplan9,2,Mon Apr 13 17:29:26 2015 UTC,calm the fuck down. lombardi didn't see it as an issue they had a players only meeting. The williams/kopi thing looked like horsing around.

losangeleskings,32f5sj,MagicArc,5,Mon Apr 13 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly, over blown by media.  The players are a family, sometimes the family needs to handle their own business without the coach.  The lockout was done during the EPIX series, could have very much been to keep everyone out, not just Sutter.  Kopi-Williams stuff was probably just frustration.  Possible last game for Williams, can understand it being seen as end of era and been frustrated."

losangeleskings,329rml,Ghost00,5,Sat Apr 11 23:25:52 2015 UTC,"Bittersweet, but I'll be glad to see him go out on his own terms instead of him pushing to next year and some kind of injury making the choice for him. I'm also glad he got to go for such a fun ride with us through the ups and downs of it and got his name on the cup from it.  I'm glad to see him go out with us, pretty much.  But to the few people who are all 'Thank god he's so bad' fucking shame on you and I have very not nice things to say about that. He wasn't a perfect player but there is no such thing as a perfect hockey player. Doughty mouths off and takes stupid penalties for it, Quick can kick a puck out of the air but let's in easy goals, Kopitar is an amazing forward but goes for a long time without having a whole lot to show for it- I could keep going, too. The thing to focus on was what he did to for us and the fact is RR has been a help to us.   I'll be happy to see him bow out as a King, he's a really awesome guy."
losangeleskings,329rml,BiohazardPixie,8,Sun Apr 12 04:04:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when he was hugging all the players when he left the ice, and then took pics with his kids and his wife, I figured he was retiring. So glad I fan girled all over him when I had the chance. I felt ridicukous when I did it, but he was so sweet, and the pic and autograph I got will long be some of my favorite Kings memorabilia."
losangeleskings,329rml,michorizzzo,6,Sat Apr 11 22:04:46 2015 UTC,he is the NICEST player I have ever met. After meeting him I became a huge fan of him.
losangeleskings,329rml,thegetawayplan9,14,Sat Apr 11 23:04:28 2015 UTC,"I have told this story before, but during the STH player signing event at the LA Zoo Robyn did something amazing.  So it was really poorly handled. They had tickets for certain lines and the Brown/Regehr/Voynov/Doughty/Williams line was super long. I believe they weren't collecting the tickets right and people just kept coming.  Well the event was coming to a close but still a pretty decent line of people waiting 3 hours to get signatures. Some players just took a bee line out the back way. Regehr did something different. He started going down the line of people and just started signing things for everyone. Williams followed him, but Robyn lead the charge.  Total class act. I'll miss him."
losangeleskings,329rml,WoozleWuzzle,6,Sat Apr 11 23:15:27 2015 UTC,i was earlier in that line so i got the autograph. but people were skipping over him in line. And he was totally fine with it. Just would shake peoples hands. just was happy to be there. Really the nicest guy

Toffoli has proven to be a great hockey player this season, much like our other Kings.  It's not a blessing in disguise, we just need to show up next year in full force. We have a great team and a solid franchise. This is all just a part of our amazing history as a club."
losangeleskings,32ajlo,beardslayer,2,Sun Apr 12 02:34:03 2015 UTC,"it could spell disaster if we lose a chunk of players in the offseason. Granted im not the most knowledgeable with NHL trading but Im nervous that we will lose a few key players and it might be a different team we see next year. I really hope Toffoli stays on and his contract is sorted. If we lose Reggie to retirement were gonna be short Mitchell, Voynov and Regehr in 2 years. Thats a serious hole in our defense even with Sekera.  I think well need to fix those holes first....  If Pearson/Carter/Toffoli reemerge with the same success as this year and Gabby/Kopi put in the offense theyre capable of well be right back in it again"

losangeleskings,329wm9,MattHand13,3,Sat Apr 11 23:23:12 2015 UTC,The NY Post is garbage. File it away to see if anyone else confirms the story.
losangeleskings,329wm9,RubyRhod,4,Sat Apr 11 22:45:19 2015 UTC,Can confirm. NY Post is the least reputable newspaper around. There essentially a libelous tabloid.

losangeleskings,32cjez,surferboy736,16,Sun Apr 12 17:13:33 2015 UTC,It didnt. Our poor shootout record did. Also Voynov's salary situation did.
losangeleskings,32cjez,Sniffman,2,Sun Apr 12 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"Spot on.  If we would have been at least 50% in the shoot out, we would have been in the playoffs easily."
losangeleskings,32cjez,AnthonyNHB,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:22:31 2015 UTC,"While this is correct, you can't ignore the impact TT and Pearson have on the team. I think there was a stretch with both of them out? The Kings didn't score much. Just getting one of them back had a huge impact, wasn't that the game TT scored a couple vs Chicago or something like that? Having Pearson the entire season may have resulted in 2 extra wins. Regardless, anyone would reflect on the season with disappointment in the OT record and overall roller coaster ride it turned out to be."
losangeleskings,32cjez,kingsnwings,8,Sun Apr 12 21:09:36 2015 UTC,I'd blame the Voynov situation first.  Made the back end a mess all season.  Especially when combined with the Richards clusterf*ck.
losangeleskings,32cjez,alljake,6,Sun Apr 12 18:01:33 2015 UTC,Voynov hurt us worse.
losangeleskings,32cjez,thegetawayplan9,2,Sun Apr 12 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"Letting Mitchell walk, Voynov situation, Martinez injuries, Regehr being old and beat up... all led to a wacky chemistry on the blue line. I will say though, we got to see what McNabb can do, and I think the future will be bright.   Pearson's injury took the wind out of the sails.   Failure to win in OT/shootout was our death-knell."
losangeleskings,32cjez,mysongodzilla,3,Sun Apr 12 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"It started with trading Mitchel. Which at the time looked like a good call. Then the Slava situation made the trading of Mitchel look like a bad call. Then us having to rely on rookie defenders and playing drew 30minutes made a lot of games go to OT/SO which we lost. Pearson getting hurt added insult to injury, and tofolli had mono and was out for a few games. All in all it was a vicious snowball effect. Not one person is responsible. Well besides Slava I guess"

When it came to re-signing guys, we went with Greene over Mitchell because he's younger and a righty and we already had Regehr who plays a similar role."
losangeleskings,32cjez,OliverSmiff,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:20:00 2015 UTC,"It was more than one thing as /u/chasej805 said. Losing Tanner didn't help the situation, but I don't think his injury was the reason for that mid season slide.  I think it might also have been the attitude that they have been through adversity before and pulled through so they may have just sat on their laurels a little too much. Missing the playoffs in a weird way may be better for the team than making the playoffs and losing in the second round or something. There will be new guys on the team next year who should bring new fire plus the remaining guys will, hopefully, come back with a renewed drive to capture what they lost."

losangeleskings,329ufc,sonician,3,Sat Apr 11 22:08:46 2015 UTC,The fact that you are wondering if Sutter is this kind of coach is a pretty big indication that he isn't. If he was so bad in the locker room that the team was locking him out (which would have come out a few days after it happened if not the next day) then it'd be almost impossible for him to hide that kind of attitude on the bench. Especially this year.
losangeleskings,329ufc,KingsfanMDJ,2,Sat Apr 11 22:46:41 2015 UTC,I was just wondering the same thing
losangeleskings,329ufc,deceptiveclock,3,Sat Apr 11 22:10:31 2015 UTC,The details of what went down seem awfully specific if it was just made up. How bizarre.
losangeleskings,329ufc,thegetawayplan9,2,Sat Apr 11 22:13:43 2015 UTC,"I won't believe it until I see it come from a reliable source (sorry NY Post), but time is definitely a HUGE factor. As great as the Kings have been, constantly playing deep into the playoffs and the added bonus of teams upping their level of play/physicality every time they play us are the reason why repeat championships are so hard in every sport.   The second this about Sutter I can only hope is not true, but it's not entirely unbelievable. There are so many stories of coaches coming in and leading a team to great places only to lose the locker room after the same fire and brimstone speeches that brought out the passion for the team, alienates them from that same coach.   Hoping it's not true, wouldn't be shocked if it was."

losangeleskings,327kyr,Sniffman,2,Sat Apr 11 19:01:12 2015 UTC,"The ""authentics"" pictured are the Indonesian made ones with the green neck tape. Laaaaame."
losangeleskings,327kyr,LazerMcBlazer,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:31:40 2015 UTC,Whats wrong with indonesian made vs non indonesian made if you don't mind me asking?
losangeleskings,327kyr,LAKingBob,2,Sat Apr 11 17:05:46 2015 UTC,"Reebok basically tried to trick consumers a few years ago by making their Authentics in Indonesia vs Canada. These are differentiated by the bright green neck tape and lack of other tags.   The Canadian made ones are the same jerseys the players wear. Very durable materials, everything sewn on, fight straps, made to be worn with pads underneath and made to take a major beating while still being breathable. They also make the Premier, which are replicas (made in Indonesia) where everything is heat pressed on to much cheaper materials, and slimmer cut since they're not really made to be worn on the ice.   Reebok tried to pull one over on people by making ""Authentics"" in the same factories they make the Premiers. They are essentially a hybrid of the two. Some double reinforced areas, bigger cuts, fight straps, but nowhere near the quality of the Canadian made Authentic Edge jerseys. You'll see collectors call them Indo-Edge jerseys. This wouldn't be a very big problem save for the fact that Reebok was trying to sell them for the same price (or very close to it) as the Canadian Authentics. Once people caught on, there was a pretty big backlash and for the most part, production of Indo-Edge jerseys have stopped.   There's really nothing wrong with them, they're still a step up from the Premiers, they're just still worlds away from the Canadian Authentics and I hate feeling like a company is trying to take advantage of their customers."
losangeleskings,327kyr,LazerMcBlazer,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:18:07 2015 UTC,"That explains why I'll see a ""made in indonesia"" disclaimer on some sites.  Your post was very insightful, thank you!  I was hoping to pick up an Authentic Doughty at a good price but if they're indo-edges, I guess I can wait until I find another site to sell the canadian made at a discount during the summer.    After today it's not like I'm going to wear a jersey anytime soon Haha I made myself sad"
losangeleskings,327kyr,LAKingBob,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:22:49 2015 UTC,"The one strange thing is that I have seen Canadian Authentics and Indo-Edges at the TeamLA store at different times. Like, sometimes they have one or the other, sometimes they've had both. So these could actually be the Canadian ones with a stock photo. I read a post on the icejerseys forum where a guy ordered an Authentic gold throwback from TeamLA based on the picture and was sent the CCM version with the purple shoulder yokes. They really don't know what they're doing over there so it might be worth it to call or email and ask which version it is. If that's the Canadian ones, that's a great price. A new customized Canadian Authentic would normally be around $400 when all is said and done."
losangeleskings,327kyr,LazerMcBlazer,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:27:54 2015 UTC,"I made a phone call to the TeamLA store at Staples and the person I spoke with knew exactly what I was talking about when I mentioned if the jerseys in the store were made in Canada or Indonesia.  You were right, the TEAMLA store at Staples has both indo-edges and made in Canada but unfortunately, they're only blanks.  I called the site's support and they weren't able to verify if these jerseys are made in Canada or not until the warehouse opened again on Monday (when the sale ends).   What do you think I should do from here (purchase anyways and hope for the best or wait for another retailer to go on sale)?"
losangeleskings,327kyr,LAKingBob,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:40:36 2015 UTC,"It's a total crapshoot. The rear photos for the Authentic are actually Premier jerseys. You can tell by the word mark on the left wrist. So the photos are all completely wrong. The Kopitar one even has the old Reebok Vector logos on it they haven't used in three seasons.   I'd check the return policy, see if it would be an easy return if you weren't happy with it when it showed up. It's a tough call. I hate that they don't even write where it's made in the description."
losangeleskings,327kyr,LazerMcBlazer,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"Returning it isn't as simple as other stores I've experienced but it's easy enough, (just have to swallow the cost of shipping both ways if I decide to return it, which sucks as a broke college student)."

If this is the best deal I can expect for a while, I'll probably make a trip to LA in the morning.  Sucks being a broke college student :/"

losangeleskings,324kq0,EinsamWulf,3,Fri Apr 10 16:12:34 2015 UTC,Yall should come down to toyota sports center
losangeleskings,324kq0,KingsfanMDJ,3,Fri Apr 10 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"I think the plan was to play pick up tomorrow morning from 8-10am at the rinks in hb? My buddy the goalie is coming so at least we have that to look forward to. I'm playing tonight at 9:30 too.  Dude, we should get a sub vs. sub game going! Could you imagine? It would be like $10-12 a person if we got 20 people to do it? I think it's like an extra $20 to have a score keeper too so they could do the clock and the scoreboard and we could see if anyone knows anyone whos a ref and we could make a trophy? LIKE THE SOCAL SUB CUP?! or something. Idk, HELP ME OUT ON THIS ONE."
losangeleskings,324kq0,LOUD__NOISES,3,Fri Apr 10 16:22:28 2015 UTC,"/u/WoozleWuzzle you think this would hold any potential, a pick-up game of /r/losangeleskings vs. /r/anaheimducks?"
losangeleskings,324kq0,DamnRandall,4,Fri Apr 10 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"I can help you guys by making sure there is visibility in the sub, but since I don't play pickup I am no way qualified to actually organize or help organize besides you guys getting visibility on /r/losangeleskings."

Get a date that works for everyone, probably on a saturday or sunday mid day."

I was planning on seeing what we could do as far as roller, but if we get enough people for ice too we could do that! I'll probably throw a feeler post out there on both subs here soon."
losangeleskings,324kq0,paranoidpikachu,2,Fri Apr 10 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, I just assumed ice but either way I'm in.   Actually, if it's going to be roller, I could probably get a friend or two to come if we're short a couple people."

losangeleskings,325ehg,Yogi_the_duck,4,Fri Apr 10 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  So basically what we want to do here is get a pick up game or even a real game (with refs and a scorekeeper) played by reddit users from each teams sub! Bragging rights, and maybe even some little trophy will be on the line. If you're interested in playing or contributing to the game by taking pictures or video or refereeing or whatever you wanna do, please take a second to fill out the survey and let me know that you're interested!  thanks guys!"
losangeleskings,325ehg,EinsamWulf,4,Fri Apr 10 18:55:29 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm one step above a bender but fuck yes would I play. It would be a great way to get our two sub to meet and murder the fuck out of those billed bastards bond over our mutual love of the sport.  Afterwards we should do some beer/food and have everyone mingle.  edit: I already have the right gear: http://imgur.com/a/T2NY6
losangeleskings,325ehg,EinsamWulf,2,Fri Apr 10 20:31:21 2015 UTC,"That would be the plan. Everybody meet up, play, photo op, grab a few brews and some grub at whatevers closest and hang out for a bit and get to know eachother. Bring everyone together, ya know?"
losangeleskings,325ehg,EinsamWulf,3,Fri Apr 10 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I figure once we get a feel for players we have each team set a captain and maybe have each team meet at least once so they can get a feel for where there players are at and create somewhat balanced lines. With that said the end goal should be fun but knowing how competitive Hockey fans get we will probably end up with a heck of a game. As long as everyone leaves it all on the Ice I think this will be a great event to look forward to.  If there is enough of a response maybe we could do it a few times throughout the season, play a game before an LA vs Anaheim game and then either go to the game or have a group watch party (or both?)."
losangeleskings,325ehg,EinsamWulf,2,Fri Apr 10 21:03:10 2015 UTC,"I really like that idea.  I will have to see based on the responses from this sub who would want to captain. I haven't gotten much response compared to the Ducks sub (22 people from Ducks, 6 from Kings so far!) so realistically it's going to come down to who wants to play.   I think it would be awesome to get a solid group from each sub and turn it into something we do once a month or every other month or like you said when the teams play!"
losangeleskings,325ehg,zattk94,2,Fri Apr 10 21:41:25 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome!  I posted this to the ""LA Kings Fans of San Diego"" page so hopefully that gets some more visibility. Some Kings fans may have taken a break from social media and the like after last night so it may be a few days before you get a larger response."

I don't think I turned my phone on for like 2 days or something. So I get it.  Thank you for your effort to get more visibility on this. I really want to get this thing rolling and have it be something we all can do together. We all interact quite often and I think it's a shame that we don't know eachother, or at least haven't met eachother."

losangeleskings,325ehg,EinsamWulf,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:33:04 2015 UTC,It's pretty thin. It has an athletic fit so it tends to be a bit of a pain to pull over my pads. It's not so tight that it restricts my movement though.
losangeleskings,325ehg,zattk94,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:37:14 2015 UTC,I just got a new one because I was playing in a ccm chevy logo jersey but my shoulder pads wore holes in the chest. So I went to my hockey shop and they had 100% blank old ccm jerseys that are the thicker more durable authentic material since it was $5 compared to $20 for one of those. It the caps old black 3rd too

losangeleskings,325ehg,zattk94,2,Sat Apr 11 18:01:30 2015 UTC,I'm fine for the most part. I'm not a great skaters and I lost an edge and popped my knee cap out and back in tearing my lateral patellofemoral ligament. Need surgery to replace it which sucks cause that's the one thing I'm very afraid of.
losangeleskings,325ehg,wiseaus_stunt_double,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:00:34 2015 UTC,That's brutal man.   You're afraid of surgery?  What part of surgery are you afraid of?
losangeleskings,325ehg,zattk94,2,Sun Apr 12 00:10:34 2015 UTC,The getting knocked out part. I did the same thing to my other knee and I'm not afraid to admit I cried both when I got the diagnosis and when I got there for surgery. It ruined my football career and I don't want this to keep me from doing anything athletic
losangeleskings,325ehg,wiseaus_stunt_double,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:30:51 2015 UTC,Are you afraid you won't come back out of it?   Or is it something else?

Everyone used the same excuse ""just wanna see someone new win it"" but we all know they're salty as fuck. The same people who commented saying ""fuck LA"" and stuff like that are the same people who would downvote you for saying that about another team, it's a big infinite circle jerk.

The LA vs Chicago rivalry will have to take a hiatus this year as there are other stories to tell but don't worry too much about us, we always find a way back into the fight.  You guys have a post season to win, if memory serves this is your year and we have to get Connor McDavid (yes I know it's highly unlikely but the tears from /r/hockey would be amazing if it happened) ready for the Crown.  Go get that cup Hawks and show the rest of the NHL that West is best."
losangeleskings,3245e0,EinsamWulf,5,Fri Apr 10 15:44:40 2015 UTC,So true.  The respectful Kings-Hawks rivalry is one of the best things about Hockey.  Sad we won't get it this year.  Nothing like two Heavyweights at their best going 7 games.
losangeleskings,3245e0,alljake,3,Fri Apr 10 17:01:07 2015 UTC,I have friends who flat out hate the Kings now because they beat us last season.  It's like they didn't just watch the greatest seven game series ever.  Kings did nothing but earn my respect.
losangeleskings,3245e0,nenright,3,Fri Apr 10 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"I was watching the first Hawks kings game this season, and somebody asked on of the CSN chicago if 2014 kings Hawks was the best series he'd ever seen and HES like ""no, because the Hawks didnt win"". Like what the fuck, man, that series blows every other series I've seen in any sport out of the water and you're gonna be like nah it wasn't cuz my team didn't win. Anyways, sucks that we don't get another one this year but please win the cup. I've been a kings and Hawks fan(born in IL, live in CA) since I started playing/watching hockey. See you in next year's WCF, hopefully with McDavid."
losangeleskings,3245e0,nenright,2,Fri Apr 10 19:11:28 2015 UTC,"It seriously drives me nuts.  I'm, of course, a Hawks fan first - but I'm also a fan of HOCKEY.  As long as it's not the Blues or the Wings (add the Preds to that list in recent years), I can watch and enjoy.  Yeah it sucked that the Hawks lost that series last season, but it was the greatest series I have ever seen played.  I can't hate a team for being better on a night that literally could have gone either way."
losangeleskings,3245e0,alljake,3,Fri Apr 10 21:06:30 2015 UTC,"Game 5 6 and 7 in that series were just ridiculous. I mean, fucking shit, 3 OT periods, chances everywhere, crazy bounces, great plays. I don't know if I'll ever see a series as good. Game 5 has to be the best one, in my opinion, because of that first overtime period. That was fucking terrifying to watch as a fan of one of the teams.  Then game 7 next, just because of all the momentum changes, and then game 6, which was still fucking amazing. My god, that pass by kane on Keith's tying goal. Fuck. I'm still in awe of that play.  I think I'm going to rewatch the series."

losangeleskings,3238vb,strategolegends,15,Fri Apr 10 07:51:15 2015 UTC,It's pretty horrible right now.
losangeleskings,3238vb,Lolmoqz,4,Fri Apr 10 08:16:28 2015 UTC,I made a little comment just to collect all that sweet karma EDIT: grammar

losangeleskings,3238vb,seabass4507,19,Sat Apr 11 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the sentiment, but I lived through a lot of real hopeless and frustrating years as a Kings fan. This season was disappointing, but I'd rather be a Stanley Cup hangover team than the loveable losers we were pre-2012."

losangeleskings,3238vb,krucz36,3,Fri Apr 10 14:38:01 2015 UTC,maybe the unfunny shithead act on /r/hockey will stop since they got humiliated this year?   Honestly I wouldn't mind it if 99% of it weren't so boring and unoriginal.
losangeleskings,3238vb,NudeEudaimonia,4,Fri Apr 10 19:44:16 2015 UTC,"I could care less about the shit-talking in that sub. It's sports. Nothing can evaporate my still-lingering Stanley Cup euphoria from 2012, let alone ruin it from last season. I guess the only thing that stings is San Jose's hatred of L.A. I mean.. I really like the Sharks. :(  Besides, I treat all Ducks fans like shit even when they have a killer season like they've been having.fuckyouducksihateyou"
losangeleskings,3238vb,kiwirish,3,Fri Apr 10 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah we still had a decent team, it's just embarrassing to be that team that won it all then couldn't even make the playoffs."
losangeleskings,3238vb,jibbybonk,25,Fri Apr 10 22:31:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, Ive said this before, Ill say it again. The ONLY reason why #regicide was a thing is because ALL of the other 29 teams in the league were fuckin terrified of you guys.  The Kings are still an amazing team, and you can see that from how much the rest of the league wanted you guys out of the playoffs.  Being hated by other fanbases is the highest compliment you can get.   You guys will be back next year, and thats scary as hell."
losangeleskings,3238vb,kingsnwings,19,Fri Apr 10 13:40:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree, most people on hockey just hate king fans in general too."

I am a Kings fan but more importantly im a hockey fan and I have no ill will towards any other team."
losangeleskings,3238vb,kingsnwings,5,Fri Apr 10 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"I've never had or seen a normal conversation occur with a Kings fan hater. They typically just say something that is a generalized stereotype and never attempt to explain why or use examples. The only hate that ever gets explained is from Duck fans, and its just the local rivalry thing so that makes sense. But then I promptly get confused when they call the Kings bandwagon fans. Oh well"
losangeleskings,3238vb,Thats_So_Based,5,Fri Apr 10 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"Whenever Ducks fans call us bandwagoners, I just tell them that their team wouldn't be here without Kings fans."
losangeleskings,3238vb,crass_bonanza,3,Fri Apr 10 19:51:02 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if the kings had no fan base before the recent cups there would be no teams in anaheim and san jose.  Why fans of those two teams fail to see that amazes me."
losangeleskings,3238vb,Resolute45,3,Sat Apr 11 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think so myself, but given how the ""operation regicide"" joke got so out of hand, I can easily see how you guys would feel that way.  As others have said, that meme isn't a thing if the Kings weren't so god damned terrifying; fans don't boo nobodies.  The irony is that we Flames fans are probably LA's biggest fans among the enemy teams.  Many of us still have a lot of respect for Sutter and Regehr.  I'm actually sad that it had to be you or us."
losangeleskings,3238vb,kingsnwings,4,Fri Apr 10 16:31:21 2015 UTC,"i think it goes back even before last years cup. maybe even 2012's. a lot of fans give crap to the non traditional markets. and for whatever reason LA is dangerous and full of thug fans. Top that off with the recent band wagon hate train and most people dislike LA. Then again, most east coast americans dislike LA as a city to begin with so there is that"
losangeleskings,3238vb,Resolute45,3,Fri Apr 10 17:03:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see that.   I've never bought into that northern/Canadian hockey xenophobia myself, so my own skewed perspective could definitely cause me to overlook it."
losangeleskings,3238vb,EinsamWulf,2,Fri Apr 10 17:05:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly right now you guys have the team to watch, even if you guys don't do that well the post season experience will go a long way toward your teams future success. Best of luck.  It's not always easy to deal with defeat but that is Hockey, you get knocked down and you get back up and keep playing. The Kings will be back, we know this.  Flame on, Flames bro."

losangeleskings,3238vb,Wheezin_Ed,9,Fri Apr 10 14:18:24 2015 UTC,"As a Bruins fan, I get the same feeling for /r/hockey considering all the hate both our teams get. I was cheering for you guys so hard last night. Between my B's being on the ropes, and probably being done, to you guys losing, I was pretty crushed last night. I'm sorry you guys had to go down like that, but you've been my number two team for quite a few years (I used to love those purple jerseys!) and I loved seeing you win it in '12 and '14. We'll be right there in the offseason with you, but we'll both come back strong next year!  Edit: By the way, after playing the Ducks a few times more than we usually do, Fuck them so hard"

Unfortunately it had to come down between the two of us.  Also don't lose faith just yet, I love the Bruins (got an Orr jersey hanging in my room) and I think if they make it into the playoffs they could upset some teams (looking at you, Montreal)."

I feel like it is a bunch of 12 year olds pissing on a fire.   Great run by you guys over the past couple of seasons. I am sure you will be back in full force next year.   PS - imagine the hate if you guys win McDavid? There's a small part of me that would enjoy the ""Karma's a bitch"" moment if the Kings actually got McDavid."

losangeleskings,3238vb,TheEw0kGamer,4,Fri Apr 10 14:50:43 2015 UTC,I surprised how that went. I would have thought the Ducks fans wanted us in for revenge. I thought rivals would want to go through the team to beat to get to the cup.
losangeleskings,3238vb,TroubleBruin,3,Fri Apr 10 15:26:43 2015 UTC,"I did. Not even for revenge, just to shit or get off the pot. If you can't win a 1-8 matchup and go through a team you've been better than for (pardon me) all three of the last regular seasons, just get it over with and hit the links. I saw LA as a proving ground. Still do. Although I like our chances better now."
losangeleskings,3238vb,krucz36,2,Fri Apr 10 16:33:55 2015 UTC,anyone watching hockey the last few years knows the Kings are miserable for the most part during the regular season. that's nothing anyone needs to pardon you for pointing out. they're built for playoff games which is what blows my mind about the last three...they were effectively playoff games and the Kings were super flat and uninterested. I dunno how much Lombardi's going to do in the offseason but it could be something. being that playoff machine is a great idea but we just saw the main issue with that this season...

losangeleskings,3238vb,cushmoney,3,Fri Apr 10 15:11:05 2015 UTC,I think he's signed for the next 3-5. I think he and Segs are going to be signing career contracts a la Toews and Kane in the next couple years.

losangeleskings,3230r4,kepaa,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:10:39 2015 UTC,"It sucks to have the season be over (yes, there's still the game against the Sharks... but that'll likely be a ""pick-up"" game of sorts at this point). Maybe we've been a bit spoiled by having seen playoff hockey for years straight. And, it definitely has taken a toll on the Kings. They've played almost a full extra season within the last 3 years due to all of the playoff games. I think that the extended offseason may be good for them this year (plus the Kings have gone, win, out, win, out... so next season has high hopes with that pattern). I'm sure the Kings wouldn't want to be out, but the rest will be good. Everyone can heal up. And, we can make another run at it next year.   That said, I wouldn't be opposed to seeing some moves in the off season. Possibly picking up a D-man (though with a full, healthy crew this may not be necessary). Very likely looking for a forward or two to add some scoring punch (we're a good defensive team... meaning we can win games decided by one goal [except for OT, apparently], but we need to have the ability to net more goals). It'll be interesting to see what develops... if anything.   As for now, I'm not sure who I'll pick as my ""team"" to follow in the playoffs. I'm leaning on Ottawa right now (they're an organization that has had a lot of ups and downs... and, similar to the Kings this year, have been on the outside looking in as of late, but they've been able to get it done [including some huge come from behind wins). With the Kings being out, I find it hard to root for another Western Conference team. Anyway, who will you be ""rooting"" for?"

I'm not even mad that were out of the playoffs because we can't win the Stanley Cup I'm just sad that kings hockey is gonna be over and I can't watch them play week in week out I just fucking love watching this team play...
losangeleskings,3236ej,Helios321,3,Fri Apr 10 08:34:28 2015 UTC,/u/WoozleWuzzle cheers to you and the other mods. You guys are rad.
losangeleskings,3236ej,doot_doot,2,Fri Apr 10 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"I hope DL puts it back together.   There is a strong argument that can be made that keeping Richards over Mitchell in the end probably influenced the season more than any other roster decision. What happened with Voynov wasn't avoidable from an organizational perspective, but Richards was a negative all season, wasn't movable, arguably became a bit of a distraction when they had to send him down, and combined with the Voynov cap hold, managed to screw us over in terms of flexibility.   Contrast that with if we had kept Mitchell and everything else happened as it did. Likely a better defence, Shore would have been here most of the season (and maybe you keep Vey).  Priority número uno should be to get Sekera signed to something decent."
losangeleskings,3236ej,Omnivirus,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:50:20 2015 UTC,"I agree. All season I was hoping someone would step up or we would acquire someone to replace Mitchell, but we never quite did (I have high hopes for Sekera, though). Of course, the injuries, Voynov's suspension, and the youth back there just compounded everything, but I fully believe that the fundamental problem on defense was that we never replaced Mitchell."
losangeleskings,3236ej,hearthealthymeals,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:10:25 2015 UTC,I think our defense is fine. That's what we got Sekera for. But these scoring slumps kill us. Especially when our win % of 1-goal games is so low. And especially in the shootout. What a demonstration of brick hands
losangeleskings,3236ej,Lolmoqz,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:18:49 2015 UTC,"Sekera is a free agent, gotta resign him if he is going to help.  I agree if we had him all season, he is a decent replacement for Voynov.   Regehr could be gone as well, and we know people have strong feelings about him.    So lots of Q's on the back end.  Although I admit I'm not particuarly worried.  Dean, other than blowing the Richards situation (should have bought him out with the compliance buyout), is amazing."
losangeleskings,3236ej,alljake,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:59:01 2015 UTC,"Obviously it sucks, but in a way I'm kinda glad. We've played a ton of hockey the last 3 years and I'm sure the players are really needing a long summer to rest up. This way Pearson has time to fully recover and not get rushed so he could get into the lineup for an intense series. Lombardi will have longer to work out the Voynov situation (I hope we can get rid of him, even though I like him we don't need that distraction). I just think they really need the rest and they'll come back next year with a sour taste and demolish teams."

You can go to any other team subreddit and somewhere in the comments you will find someone saying ""fuck the kings"" unabashedly and with many people agreeing with it.  On our sub when someone says something along the lines of ""fuck the insert team name"" they are immediately downvoted.  I think of all the teams we have showed the best sportsmanship and among all the hate showed the most love for other teams. That's why this sub is the best, and thats why all you guys are the best.

losangeleskings,322xdv,GummiBearMagician,10,Fri Apr 10 03:38:58 2015 UTC,"You're welcome to stick around! I love our sub, it's a big ol' lovefest compared to the others. It was a bit jarring to wander into the other subs to say hi or good game, and get greeted with hostility."
losangeleskings,322xdv,wiseaus_stunt_double,7,Fri Apr 10 04:16:42 2015 UTC,I love the guys in /r/canucks -- you guys helped my plan my New Year's trip.
losangeleskings,322xdv,t3rneado,11,Fri Apr 10 04:28:35 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  Coming with peace here! You guys are a very tough team that no one wanted to see in the playoffs strictly because we were scared! You have an incredible team, my favorite all time player is on your team, (think Ex-Flame)! I won't be surprised if you absolutely destroy next year! With that being said I am more than ridiculously ecstatic that the Flames have clinched a berth in the Playoffs. our first in 6 years.. so thank you for giving us  a break!!"
losangeleskings,322xdv,PissOnEddieShore,10,Fri Apr 10 04:44:31 2015 UTC,"You know what? Go win the whole thing. Your team plays hockey right. No cheap bullshit, no diving, no stupid penalties...Of all the Western teams in the playoffs I dislike the Flames the least (my first NHL game was Kings vs Flames). Enjoy the playoffs man!"
losangeleskings,322xdv,t3rneado,5,Fri Apr 10 04:42:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know who is Down-voting you.  I appreciate your thoughts on the matter.  We are the least penalized team on the league 0 in last 4 games. I like to think in terms of plain old hard work, we are kind of taking after a 2012 La Kings team! hopefully results will be the same!"
losangeleskings,322xdv,PissOnEddieShore,5,Fri Apr 10 05:00:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the gold man, I won't be mad if you end up with some silver."
losangeleskings,322xdv,OverlordKopi_2037,33,Fri Apr 10 05:11:04 2015 UTC,"Can't be mad here, we blew it ourselves. Seriously, fuck /r/hockey though. I'm sure this will all be handled with some subtlety and class /s."
losangeleskings,322xdv,screech_owl_kachina,8,Fri Apr 10 05:20:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, games in January count just as much as games in April. No more squeaking into 8th seed."
losangeleskings,322xdv,PotatoSackOfCourage,53,Fri Apr 10 03:42:45 2015 UTC,Fuck /r/hockey. That gdt was brutal
losangeleskings,322xdv,wiseaus_stunt_double,35,Fri Apr 10 03:48:12 2015 UTC,"The word 'classy' gets bandied about like crazy in /r/hockey, but I have to say the lack of class in that thread was unbearable.  If Boston makes the playoffs, I'll be pulling for the Bruins.  Why?  That's the only other team that is as hated as us.  Now, let's get McDavid."
losangeleskings,322xdv,Pikachu1989,13,Fri Apr 10 03:39:00 2015 UTC,"Fuck yeah Bruins, my dad is a Bruins fan and the Bruins are my East team. I will be rooting extra hard for the B's if they make it in.   I fucking wished the Red Wings got eliminated though."
losangeleskings,322xdv,PittPensPats,9,Fri Apr 10 03:44:49 2015 UTC,Pittsburgh also gets a lot of hate in /r/hockey
losangeleskings,322xdv,Neddih,5,Fri Apr 10 03:51:16 2015 UTC,Bruins and Pens. The only other teams I'll somewhat root for when they're not playing the Kings.
losangeleskings,322xdv,Pagooy,3,Fri Apr 10 03:51:35 2015 UTC,I was hoping you guys would pull through and get the W tonight. Hopefully the Flyers beat the Sens and the B's win. /r/hockey is not fun if you're a kings/bruins/pens fan. It's just awful.
losangeleskings,322xdv,gambit700,12,Fri Apr 10 03:49:42 2015 UTC,You mean that downvote thread was downvotey
losangeleskings,322xdv,strategolegends,3,Fri Apr 10 04:06:01 2015 UTC,"Oh god, why did I look?"
losangeleskings,322xdv,Trevoc555,4,Fri Apr 10 03:40:36 2015 UTC,"It's ok, we can wash away the eye cancer with tears, friend."
losangeleskings,322xdv,Dr-Dinosaur,3,Fri Apr 10 03:42:40 2015 UTC,"You should've seen the /sp/ thread, that was beyond terrible."
losangeleskings,322xdv,crewdoughty,9,Fri Apr 10 03:45:00 2015 UTC,Welcome to being an LA sports fan lol. Inferior cities tend to get jealous
losangeleskings,322xdv,ishzendejas,11,Fri Apr 10 03:46:08 2015 UTC,Seriously. Was there an Operation Trail of Tears when the Blackhawks won two in three years ?
losangeleskings,322xdv,Enthusiasm-Curbed,11,Fri Apr 10 03:49:50 2015 UTC,"We're not in mourning over our blown season. We're mourning the loss of what we thought our future was going to be. As Kings fans, we need to let it go. Things don't always work out the way you plan. Sometimes, they work out better anyway.  I fucking love this team. Go Kings...Go.   (tweaked as hell Frasier quote)"
losangeleskings,322xdv,KeshasBiggestFan,9,Fri Apr 10 03:58:30 2015 UTC,Hold me.
losangeleskings,322xdv,50in15,6,Fri Apr 10 03:38:41 2015 UTC,hugs
losangeleskings,322xdv,sithlordmoore,11,Fri Apr 10 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"Great late season surge from a dynamic team that should never be counted out. Any other year you would have had enough. Fully expect to see you guys be a top-tier threat next season. I really enjoyed watching you beat Blackhawk butt last playoffs, and I hope you have a productive offseason.  Plus, now you can stick around and take the most juicily vindictive pleasure in watching every team but one be eliminated in the end! Wear your fade with pride, Kings, you guys put up with more from the sub than most."
losangeleskings,322xdv,lordjedediah,5,Fri Apr 10 03:42:45 2015 UTC,Terrible late season surge. Only thing decent we did all fucking year is that surge on the lead up and post stadium series
losangeleskings,322xdv,hobonia,17,Fri Apr 10 03:45:19 2015 UTC,Still the best 3 year run in the salary cap era.
losangeleskings,322xdv,Moose_Dookie,9,Fri Apr 10 03:47:00 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people are gonna be mad and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't incredibly disappointed but maybe this is what the team needs.  We got fucked over pretty hard this season and I honestly think it shook up the team dynamic pretty hard. Some people say it's just an excuse but having everything happen on and off the ice combined with the sheer amount of games this team has played in the last few years has to have done a number on them.  In my opinion if this is what they need to get things back on track then more power to them. Maybe a nice long break to cool off and find out what's going on will help.  Maybe I let this stuff affect me personally too much but I've put a lot of time and emotion into this team and I'm not about to throw that all aside because of one bad season.  My only hope is that we can come back next year rested up and back in working order and have another great season.  This team has given us so much, I think it's only fair to give them support after what had to be a shitty season."
losangeleskings,322xdv,lsdcc,11,Fri Apr 10 03:40:34 2015 UTC,"Hawks fan here. I for one have to say its gonna be a bit of a bummer not being able to play you guys again in the playoffs, definitely some of the most entertaining hockey I've seen when our teams play against each other. I don't really like your team, but I damn well respect you and love me some Darryl Sutter. You guys have always been a pleasure to hang around with, especially living in SoCal, good folks at Staples. Good luck to you guys next season!"
losangeleskings,322xdv,swisschez,9,Fri Apr 10 03:44:22 2015 UTC,"You guys have been great these last couple of years and playoffs won't be the same without you.. We (Hawks) might be 'rivals' but fuck it I love seeing you guys play and never root against you unless you're playing my team.  That being said, I'm sure you'll be monsters again next season once you figure some shit out in the off season and the extra rest can't hurt either. Heal up, enjoy your two lovely cups and we'll see you next time!"
losangeleskings,322xdv,p_j_w,14,Fri Apr 10 04:09:24 2015 UTC,Goddamn it Kings  Well....at least the Sharks won't be able to ruin our playoff chances....
losangeleskings,322xdv,Branzilla91,3,Fri Apr 10 04:10:31 2015 UTC,I've never seen that gif before. It's perfect.
losangeleskings,322xdv,Pikachu1989,7,Fri Apr 10 03:38:01 2015 UTC,"This fucking blows. But I still love the hell out of this team. Can't wait for October. In the meantime, go Capitals."
losangeleskings,322xdv,viewless25,3,Fri Apr 10 03:41:09 2015 UTC,"Fucking right it was a good run and October can't come soon enough.   Tonight fucking sucked for me with Omaha losing in the Frozen Four and now the Kings getting eliminated. At least the Avs won in a SO and Berra got the shutout, which for me used to having the Avs flair makes it a little better. Don't worry Kings we will come back next year."
losangeleskings,322xdv,killjoy269,6,Fri Apr 10 03:41:01 2015 UTC,"Really sorry to hear about you guys missing the playoffs. I was hoping you guys would make it in case (and God forbid) the Rags make it, you guys have proven that you can beat them in the finals. But Oh well. We'll have to get around to that ourselves now. Enjoy watching playoff hockey from the sidelines; you learn to enjoy it, after a decade or two."
losangeleskings,322xdv,GummiBearMagician,8,Fri Apr 10 03:55:06 2015 UTC,You guys played a good season. these past couple weeks have been a hell of a lot of fun. good luck in the future KingsBros!
losangeleskings,322xdv,killjoy269,3,Fri Apr 10 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"Hey, go out there and make this playoff run worth it, you hear?"
losangeleskings,322xdv,JayPunk27,4,Fri Apr 10 04:12:07 2015 UTC,Fingers crossed. This city is hungry for some playoff hockey like you wouldn't believe
losangeleskings,322xdv,wiseaus_stunt_double,9,Fri Apr 10 04:30:25 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, can't say I'm upset that you guys got eliminated, mainly because I fear the playoff Kings. (See last year.) I'm sure y'all will make it next year, and look at this way, you won the Cup last year. (And don't throw it back at me, but I wasn't necessarily rooting for you guys, but I hate the Rangers so I wasn't really broken up to see you guys win it either.) Any way, that's my two cents."
losangeleskings,322xdv,JayPunk27,6,Fri Apr 10 04:36:04 2015 UTC,"After rockin' the Ducks for two weeks, I hope you have a long playoff run, but something needs to be done about some the Ducks fans on /r/hockey.  One guy downvoted me because I told him to show some class after he told us to fellate him.  I know he's the minority, and I know we're rivals, but that was uncalled for, and he wasn't the only Ducks fan on there lacking class.  Again, good luck in the playoffs -- may Stoner get a hat trick every game in the playoffs."
losangeleskings,322xdv,Zechs-,6,Fri Apr 10 04:01:17 2015 UTC,I upvote you on username alone. And fellate made me laugh.
losangeleskings,322xdv,rainyforest,6,Fri Apr 10 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"Leafs fan here, I hope you guys come back stronger next season. it was unfair how /r/hockey treated you guys. Even though I have a soft spot for the sharks and Wild are my west team, I like the kings. OH one thing though, don't question what you do, there's a reason why you guys won 2 cups, stick to it."
losangeleskings,322xdv,BiohazardPixie,5,Fri Apr 10 04:14:32 2015 UTC,Is it terrible of me that I wouldn't mind the Ducks making it to the Finals? I'm so fucking done with the Flames and Canucks and I want them to get swept.  In a perfect scenario we'll have the Sens beat the Ducks in the finals for a rematch of '07.
losangeleskings,322xdv,BW4LL,4,Fri Apr 10 04:06:59 2015 UTC,Of course it's not terrible but I'd rather... no.
losangeleskings,322xdv,brutalyak,12,Fri Apr 10 04:10:53 2015 UTC,"Parents got divorced this year and Kings miss the Playoffs. It's been a shit year, I'm still grateful for the last 4 though and for every user in this sub. I'm contemplating buying tickets to the last home game, but I'll have to see where my hearts at.  I wanna seriously thank everyone in this sub for making me be proud to be a Kings fan. Especially Ghost Doubledot and Woozle, you guys do a lot of hard work and don't think you're given enough dues.  Lastly, Fuck Operation Regicide!"
losangeleskings,322xdv,Fyureus,6,Fri Apr 10 04:12:45 2015 UTC,Its not the end of the world. We still have a great team and a great management. The boys will train extra hard in the summer and play extra hard next year. Besides who needs odd year cups anyway?
losangeleskings,322xdv,Thats_So_Based,7,Fri Apr 10 03:44:48 2015 UTC,I blame EA.
losangeleskings,322xdv,jbizzzzle,6,Fri Apr 10 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"The boys have played into June for the past 3 years, even they need to rest. You can't win them all.  Fuck most of /r/hockey though. If we said half the shit some of those people said... well it'd be hard to be more hated than we already are. I never thought I'd see the day when it became a bigger circlejerk than /r/soccer .  Everyone going to the game on Saturday, let's make sure to show the boys our love."
losangeleskings,322xdv,wiseaus_stunt_double,5,Fri Apr 10 03:42:26 2015 UTC,"I was kind of upset, but then I stayed thoughtful for a minute. Guys. We have 2 awesome banners hanging at Staples! All within 3 years! That's fucking awesome! I'm still going to the game on Saturday and cheering my boys. No shame. I love this fucking team. Win or lose."
losangeleskings,322xdv,Dontae92,4,Fri Apr 10 04:11:31 2015 UTC,"The odds are that if you're a subscriber on /r/losangeleskings, you're a lifer.  The Kings might have bandwagon fans, but there are none here."
losangeleskings,322xdv,RubeusShagrid,11,Fri Apr 10 04:22:20 2015 UTC,"Hawks Fan here, sorry to see you guys not make it as I was hoping to get some payback for last year. Keep your heads up Kings, time to work for next season"
losangeleskings,322xdv,Dontae92,6,Fri Apr 10 04:43:04 2015 UTC,"I have such a weird, demented love hate relationship with the Hawks, and this doesn't help it in either regard"
losangeleskings,322xdv,RubeusShagrid,4,Fri Apr 10 03:50:08 2015 UTC,"I love the Kings because my best friends are fans and I live in LA, but as soon as its Hawks vs Kings it's hawks all the way, after that Im going for the Kings again."
losangeleskings,322xdv,ILoveHipChecks,5,Fri Apr 10 03:52:18 2015 UTC,Alright you fucking bastard I'll cheer for you.
losangeleskings,322xdv,xzElmozx,11,Fri Apr 10 03:58:40 2015 UTC,It sucks to be knocked out and I'm sure seeing all the operation regicide stuff has gotten pretty old.   You guys keep your heads up and realize the only reason no one wants you in the playoffs is because everyone was too afraid to match up against you.  I'll show myself out now.
losangeleskings,322xdv,chrissytheblack,18,Fri Apr 10 04:03:28 2015 UTC,"Hey guys nucks fan her. First off, congrats on a hell of a season, and I look forward to seeing you in the playoffs next year.  Second, I feel like i have to apologize for the whole ""Regicide"" thing. I mean, I think you guys can understand us, Calgary, and Winnepeg cheering against you, but the whole league i dont get. Its just what happens when youre a dangerous playoff team that threatens every year.  Anyways, good season, hell of a run."
losangeleskings,322xdv,sanford_bc,5,Fri Apr 10 03:49:20 2015 UTC,Love you guys. What a roller coaster this season was 😰
losangeleskings,322xdv,EinsamWulf,3,Fri Apr 10 03:48:11 2015 UTC,"Damn, was a nice try guys! 2 cups in four years is something to be damn proud of. No doubt in my mind you guys will be back in the playoffs next year! Sincerely, a Canucks fan who has respect for a great team."
losangeleskings,322xdv,The_Hidden_Panda,4,Fri Apr 10 03:39:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks nucks bro, best of luck in the playoffs, if you get the chance please kill Anaheim."
losangeleskings,322xdv,Pikachu1989,5,Fri Apr 10 03:43:41 2015 UTC,You guys should take solace in the fact that you've got 2 cups to show for your dominance the past few years. We killed it for a few years and all we got was a riot and a bad rep around the world so consider yourselves lucky haha
losangeleskings,322xdv,Plamadude30k,5,Fri Apr 10 03:52:33 2015 UTC,"Fuck, tonight wasn't a good night of Hockey Action for me. First the UNO Mavericks lost in the Frozen Four earlier tonight and now the Kings miss the Playoffs. It was a fun to wear the Kings flair when I was traded in the /r/Hockey user draft and was very glad to join the ride. It sucks that it ended so soon but It was fun while it lasted. Shit, we can't complain that the last few years have been good to us. I just hope next season will bring us back to the promise land. We will have see the fight in them after missing this season.  I will be back in the Avs flair in the near future, but it was good to know you guys more. I will be rooting for the Kings at every chance I can get next season, except when we play the Avs. It was a fun ride.  GKG!"
losangeleskings,322xdv,GummiBearMagician,6,Fri Apr 10 03:47:45 2015 UTC,"Jeez, how spoiled am I? It wasn't that long ago that I was pleasantly surprised when the Kings got into the playoffs. There was a time when I felt like my Kings actively sought out every way to disappoint me. This is an altogether new form of disappointment, though.  Sigh.  There's always next year. And unlike all those other years, it actually could be a great one. There's hope for the future boys! Let's see what our lottery pick brings."
losangeleskings,322xdv,henreiman,4,Fri Apr 10 03:49:04 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with having mortgaged an off year to have won two cups in three years. After that crazy playoff run last year, we need some time to rest and bank up some good karma again.  _/ stick taps to all the boys on the ice, to Luc, Dean, and Darryl, and to the entire organization.  _/ stick taps to the awesome mods! You guys kill it day in and day out.  _/ and stick taps to all you guys. I love our sub.  By Martinez, Raccoon, and the Holy Toffoli, amen. GKG."
losangeleskings,322xdv,TheMightyCaige,5,Fri Apr 10 03:54:05 2015 UTC,"Alright you guys are a reasonable bunch and I like the reactions to this loss, but I'm still gonna go get fucked up on shit alcohol now"
losangeleskings,322xdv,Fuzzy901,5,Fri Apr 10 04:01:32 2015 UTC,"I am trying not to be a spoiled bitch by saying this, but the fact that we won the fucking Cup last year and aren't even competing for it this year is bumming me out.  I am trying to keep a PMA and remind myself that 2 in 3 years is fine.  /r/hockey can still kiss my black ass."
losangeleskings,322xdv,Day_Old_Hate,3,Fri Apr 10 04:14:33 2015 UTC,30 of the teams on /r/hockey would totally miss this year's playoffs if it meant they got to have one from last year.
losangeleskings,322xdv,Stryk-Man,4,Fri Apr 10 04:17:57 2015 UTC,"This season has been fucked I mean the whole Voynov situation at the start of the season started the title wave of bullshit. Then we lose Toffoli to mono a random illness that sidelined him while he was playing very well. Then we lose Pearson right after to a god damn broken leg and, he was playing like a straight up stud on that 70's line and I believe would have been a serious contender for most goals scored along with Toffoli and Carter. The dagger in our heart was Sekera getting injured it seemed like right as we filled that void that Voynov left BAM! Were right fucking back at where we were earlier in the season.  As heartbroken I am that the boys are gonna miss the playoffs I know were gonna come back hungry next year. Were gonna have a well rested and no lingering injuries from a deep cup run like we've had. I have no doubt these guys will come back stronger, faster, and angrier next year. Win or lose I love this team I love what we've done in the past few years to make a point that hockey in Southern California is a real thing.  GO KINGS GO"
losangeleskings,322xdv,Anewman1188,4,Fri Apr 10 04:43:45 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to say that there was at least one Duck fan hoping you'd squeeze in. I hated the outcome, but a rematch of last year's series is too good to pass up."
losangeleskings,322xdv,doot_doot,4,Fri Apr 10 04:36:12 2015 UTC,"And on the 4th year they finished their work that they had done, and they rested on the 4th year from all the work that they had done. In the name of Raccoon Jesus and Holy Toffoli. Amen. Praise be Martinez."
losangeleskings,322xdv,LordCheezus,5,Fri Apr 10 05:25:08 2015 UTC,"I also want to say a couple things about some guys who killed it for us, and some guys who killed us.    That 70's line was one of the most exciting lines in hockey I've seen in a long long time. All of them, including Kinger deserve the thanks for getting us this far.  Slava, all the evidence says that you beat your wife. For that alone, fuck you, you're no King. You also set us up to be short handed on D from the start. Thanks a lot.    Quick, you had your ups and downs, but I'd never want anyone else in net other than you.    Mike, I'll always love you. I don't know what happened to you, and it makes me sad, but you're not up to being a King anymore. You're a ghost out there. We all prayed the AHL run would wake you up, but if anything you came back even worse.    Doughty you're amazing. We need you to take the next step in your career now. You need to be a leader. No more acting like a baby. Get your head straight and be the leader we need in the years to come.    Stoll, gonna miss ya bud. This season was a rough one for you. Seems like you spent more time in the box than anyone else. Don't think we'll see you in a Kings jersey again.    Nolan, I'll be the first to admit I've often considered you nothing more than a goon. You really stepped up this year. Excited to see where you go from here with us.    Cliffy, you're the god damned best. You give it your all every damn game and leave it all out on the ice.    Muzz, I want a tattoo of your face on my belly. Nappy ass beard and all. You had some bumps but you're elite as hell, never let them tell you otherwise.    Shoutout takers. Guys. Come on. You could easily argue we lost our season in OT and shootouts. Kopi. What in the living fuck? Gaborik. Same to you.  Lastly, Chris Sutter, you're the best. You always lift the fans up. You give the guys strength, and you make your pops happy. We need him happy."
losangeleskings,322xdv,Live_Positive,19,Fri Apr 10 05:47:48 2015 UTC,"Whatever. This team didn't want the playoffs. This did this to themselves. Good season everyone, could have been much better. Fuck the Sharks, fuck the Ducks, Fuck the Blackhawks and most of all fuck r/hockey and their Operation Regicide."
losangeleskings,322xdv,Sightful,19,Fri Apr 10 07:11:17 2015 UTC,You would think the mods over at /r/hockey would at least show a little respect to us and pull the regicide bullshit from the OP on the elimination thread.  Aside from MOST Caps/Wild fans... The most classless group of asshats on the internet.

losangeleskings,322xdv,kiwirish,4,Fri Apr 10 03:45:48 2015 UTC,That's sad. A depressing way for a team like this to fall out. Shot themselves in the foot. A

Missing Pearson for half of the season and Voynov for almost all of it was rough.  I mean yeah, 2 cups in 4 years it's hard to be that mad. The Stanley Cup Playoffs have to be one of the most entertaining postseasons in sports, I can't wait to watch it unfold, even without the Kings."

It would have been nice to at least make it to the first round, so we didn't end up on a list of winners who didn't return to the playoffs, and reminded everyone that you can't kill the king, but with all that happened this year, it's a miracle we even made it this deep.  Let's go for McDavid, I guess? haha."

But I don't think all of /r/hockey is afraid of the Kings or even cares if the Kings made playoffs.  I think everyone just hopped on the regicide bandwagon.    The thing with /r/hockey is they'll give Kings fans or Blackhawks fans crap for hopping on the bandwagon but they won't say mention anything when they're on the ""lets hate the Bruins"" or the ""Leafs/Sabres/Oilers suck"" or operationregicide bandwagon.

losangeleskings,3238zi,RubyRhod,2,Fri Apr 10 06:21:36 2015 UTC,"Reddit fuzzes up- and downvotes to thwart vote manipulation. Votes on links and comments will often fluctuate wildly until a lot of time has passed. If you've ever visited your own comment history, you can probably see comments changing up or down a vote almost every time you visit. I even see it on 3+ month old comments of mine (you really think people are actually visiting and voting on those inane old comments?).   Additionally, reddit does something with the votes so that they never seem to reach high numbers. If there are hundreds of thousands of people on the front page and in subreddits, it doesn't make sense for the highest voted links to barely even break 7,000."

I'd be jealous of any team with that kind of success. I'm jealous of the San Francisco Giants. I'm jealous of the New England Patriots. I want my teams to be that good.  The self-reflection bit was talking about them celebrating someone else's failure rather than someone's success. Tarasenko's goal was a thing of beauty. It's something that people can sort by top, look at and go ""Hell yeah that shit was awesome.""  Now? It would be ""YEAH THAT TEAM WE HATE DIDN'T GO TO THE PLAYOFFS."" Even if it weren't my team, I'd think it was pretty ridiculous.  Here's my main issue.  I love good hockey. Even if my team is on the losing end. I want the best teams to make the playoffs and play against each other so I can watch some good fucking hockey.  The Kings play amazing hockey in the playoffs. I don't think anyone sane or reasonably impartial denies that. They don't make it, I think it will lower the overall talent pool in the playoffs.  Let's set something straight that you read into my post, I expect based off of presumptions about Kings fans. They are entitled to nothing. They did not earn their way into the playoffs. They have no one to blame but themselves. I am disappointed that they did not make the playoffs, but this is unrelated to my annoyance at the people on /r/hockey."

losangeleskings,322yia,Aqueries44,3,Fri Apr 10 07:58:25 2015 UTC,"It's partially a byproduct of being a divisional rival over the years and partially because you've employed some of the people I've disliked most in hockey (Zach Kassian, I'm looking at you). Add in terrible management decisions involving players (especially goalies), prospects, and coaches, as well as a schizophrenic approach to the team's visual identity and it really puts it over the top. It probably doesn't help that your fanbase is so aggressively anti-King (and not in fun way) that it has resulted in my interactions with them being predominantly unpleasant despite my best efforts. It's a shame, as I was a huge Pavel Bure fan back in the day and the city itself is beautiful. I may revisit my stance down the line, but it's too late for the current core.  Edit: Come to think of it, Dan Cloutier may have played a big part as well."

So, let me give some perspective as someone who has been on the other side of the fence: Los Angeles comes across as very entitled (esp. Laker fans). Success does that, and having the media splashing images of celebs in attendance doesn't help as that feeds into the spoiled, entitled rich kid image that the rest of the country has of LA. I remember back in 2010 going to Mt first NHL playoff game, and the girl I was dating telling me, ""Why do you want to do that? It's just the Kings.,"" like the Kings are just a byword since they weren't having success. Now, her and a bunch of friends I have that were all about the Lakers are all of a sudden Kings fans. I get the bandwagon comments on /r/hockey, but I get why everyone on here would get pissed by that because, like most Kings fans in this sub, I remember when the Kings weren't successful, but we stuck through with this team when they weren't and we finally got to enjoy Cup-winning success twice in a really short span. I've never considered Kings fans as entitled, nor will I, but fuck that Laker fan bandwagon mentality. This season will tell who the real fans are."

If we win in OT tonight, beat the Sharks and WPG loses today, there's still the nightmare scenario where Calgary loses in OT to WPG and we're knocked out (Calgary and LA will have 97, CGY gets the tie breaker, WPG gets 98 and the first wildcard)"
losangeleskings,321d5m,PittPensPats,6,Thu Apr 9 22:48:19 2015 UTC,Thanks bro! I'm wishing the best for the Pens in the East.

I'm all for chirping and ribbing but that kind of shit was nonsense if the hockey gods are up there and not just a figment of my fading imagination, there will be karmic hell to pay.  GG though."

losangeleskings,322871,antifolkhero,3,Fri Apr 10 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"His only argument is that the cops didn't speak Russian and misunderstood what his wife stated happened.  However, what the cops say she told them is extremely specific:   Marta Varlamova, Voynov’s wife, told police the couple started arguing during a Halloween party. Voynov removed her costume glasses and stomped on them, then, outside the venue, he punched her in the left jaw, according to the report.  When asked by police what the argument was about, Varlamova “stated that she could not remember,” the report said.  The dispute continued in the bedroom of the couple’s Redondo Beach home, Varlamova told police. Voynov, she said, choked her with both hands three times.  “Voynov pushed her to the ground approximately six to seven times with both hands, telling her that he wanted a divorce and to ‘Get out,’ “ the report said.  Varlamova told police that Voynov then kicked her five to six times while on the ground. She said she screamed for him to stop.  When she rose, the report said, Voynov pushed her into the corner of a flat-screen television mounted on the wall, opening a gash above Varlamova’s left eye. Varlamova said the couple’s bedroom was “covered in her blood.”   Source.  I agree with innocent until proven guilty, but it isn't looking good for him, and if he is guilty, he fucked up a lot by being an asshole for one evening."

These are people who come around, catch a comment, and run with it taking it out of context and assuming this is something more than just hockey rivalry.   Do I have a vendetta against the Kings? Absolutely. They knocked out the Canucks 3 years ago and that's shitty (see also Bruins and Blackhawks). But it's nothing more than a hockey-fueled rivalry. Some of my closest friends are fans of teams I dislike and I give them shit about it and justly receive it back. It's precisely what I imagine is going on here. A bunch of hockey fans taking jabs at each other because that's what makes this game and it's fans so fucking amazing.   People who make it personal and hurtful are just giant dicks.

If the Kings won we would have seen posts from Kings fans with over 100 downvotes just for posting something innocuous as GKG! simply because there are a shitton of dicks who are ""fans"" of other teams, and how dare a Kings fan celebrate a win! Meanwhile, both the GDT and the Kings elimination thread are chock full of posts along the lines of ""SUCK MY DICK, KINGS FANS!,"" that are being upvoted.  I know not everyone on /r/hockey are jerks, but those shitbags that both post this garbage and encourage it via upvote can die in a fire for all I care."

In the end, I'm glad you didn't make the playoffs, because my liver can't take a repeat of last year. But I have no resentment towards any Kings fans or players, and I'm sure that most other fans feel that way. It just gets lost in the r/hockey circlejerk."

Also, if we win both and the Jets lose both that would work too.  I'm probably missing some stuff but those are the two obvious scenarios to me.  Edit: I just remembered that the Jets play the Flames on Saturday.  That makes things pretty interesting.  We currently have the tie-break against the Jets but no the Flames.

losangeleskings,320lgw,motivate18,3,Thu Apr 9 16:58:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what this link shows: http://hockeystandings.info/?page=threepoints  Alternatively, just going back to ties where each team gets a point. The way it is structured now, teams have much less to lose by letting a game coast to OT than they do trying to win it. The NHL seems to want games to go to OT/SO, so I don't expect that to change."

It's also amusing how much /r/hockey doesn't understand that OT/SOs have hurt us, and not helped us. They all seem to think we are getting 'awarded a pity point' or 'loser point', something like that, when in reality we are giving up our winner point. Go Kings, do or die time!"

Look at Carter, Kopi and Gabby's SO% numbers last year and back. These are shooters you'd expect to earn more. Heck, their SO% is lower than their SH% this year. By going to SO, you're letting an extremely small amount of events (as few as 6) decide the outcome of a game where defense has no input and coaching has almost none."

losangeleskings,320lgw,RubyRhod,3,Thu Apr 9 21:36:18 2015 UTC,"That's a good example, but the issue is not the awarding of the loser point, it's valuing an OT/SO just as much as a regulation win (2 points) or not valuing regulation wins enough (3 points)."

Earlier in the year, Carter, et al. would at least go for some sort of deke before shooting. But, around late January/early February, they just stopped bothering with any sort of shootout moves and started firing on the goalie as soon as they cross the blue line.  Now, we've reached the point where they just skate half-assed onto the goalie and just fire a weak shot from the top of the slot if we're lucky. It's embarassing."

Regardless of what happens in the next few days, the Kings have given us more than I ever dreamed I'd see. This run has been as fine a performance as the NHL has seen in a long time, every bit as good as the best teams after the Islanders era of the early 1980s. I saw the Kings win the Cup, I almost broke down the first time and nearly exploded with joy the second time; I saw Kopitar hoist it on Figueroa, and I saw us put in arguably the most dominant postseason in decades plus definitely the most anxiety-inducing. Whatever happens, I cannot claim to be unsatisfied, and anyone who complains about losing the next few games needs to get some perspective.  This may well be the end of an era--what I shall hereby dub ""the First Sutter Era""--but the team has the major pieces to be competitive for several more years before our stars start to really decline. A refresh is needed, and missing the playoffs will force Lombardi's hand a bit, not wholly a bad thing. Hopefully there will be a ""Second Sutter Era"" worth discussing.

But after a whole year of more concentrated hate for my team than I have seen, I am pretty much ready to punch every single person besides my Kingsbros.  But I did go a bit far. Just went off the cuff, and was fueled by anger vs wit. I half blame r/hockey for making me so hostile towards anybody sending hate our way."

Did you know that thousands upon thousands of individuals who should be here today died because of that disease, as our government fucking laughed? And that's just part of one nation where it ravages lives and kills on a daily basis  Fuck you.  edit: I'm explicitly talking about how awful it is to joke about AIDS.

losangeleskings,31w0o8,Heighdone,4,Wed Apr 8 21:44:26 2015 UTC,And what if the Kings win and the Avs lose?
losangeleskings,31w0o8,lilrabbitfoofoo,4,Wed Apr 8 17:19:08 2015 UTC,"Kings: 95 Flames: 95 WPG: 98  If the Avs lose, WPG becomes unreachable and we're battling with Calgary. Then, if WPG beat Calgary after that and we take the Sharks down, Then the Kings, Flames, and Jets stand at 97-95-100 respectively. It's tight as hell and Sutter is starting Jones over Quick vs. Edmonton ... I understand rewarding good work and don't often question Sutter Jesus, but I wouldn't be resting Quick for the playoffs with this sort of a race."
losangeleskings,31w0o8,yukiyukiyuki,5,Wed Apr 8 17:37:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the 411.  As to the game, I don't see Quick making up for a defense that didn't show up to the game or an offense that skated like it was the morning skate.  I don't fault Jones for any of those goals to be honest."
losangeleskings,31w0o8,lilrabbitfoofoo,2,Wed Apr 8 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"Then it's wait and see if Calgary wins or loses.     Simple(ish) Break down:      Kings MUST Win 2      AND      Calgary needs to lose 2 in regulation   OR   Winnipeg needs to lose 2, only one of which can go to OT"
losangeleskings,31w0o8,Todrick,3,Wed Apr 8 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"If we get that last wild card spot, it's very likely that we face Anaheim in the first round as they'll likely have the best west record. This is contrasted with having to play them in the 2nd round potentially if we were to win a matchup with the Canucks. However, in that scenario, the Ducks would draw Winnipeg in the first round, and there's a very good chance Winnipeg could win that series and we'd have to face them. Our games against them have not gone well since they started playing better.  Thus, I feel edging out Calgary is a more favorable scenario. The Ducks are a stronger team than last year and have seen their possession stats improve. It would be much better if we could have that 1st round to ease Pearson and Sekera back into the lineup."
losangeleskings,31w0o8,anexanhume,3,Wed Apr 8 17:49:19 2015 UTC,An Avs win keeps our options open. A Kings win keeps us alive!
losangeleskings,31w0o8,dalbtraps,2,Wed Apr 8 20:12:37 2015 UTC,"There are still quite a few ways for us to get in. The problem with all of the scenarios at this point is that we don't really control out own destiny anymore. It's no longer about the Kings winning, but about other teams losing. It stinks.  On the bright side, there's even still a scenario where we don't win tomorrow and can still get in:  If we lose to Calgary in overtime tomorrow, we will be at 94 points, and the Flames will be at 97, officially out of our reach. BUT, if the Jets then lose out in regulation and we get 2 points (in any fashion) in the San Jose game, we'd get the wild card spot.  That's the thing, everything right now is if...if..if...  Bottom line: a win tomorrow, in regulation, gives us the best chance to make the playoffs going into Saturday's game against the Sharks."
losangeleskings,31w0o8,ThatKingsFan,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:17:39 2015 UTC,Kings need two wins and either the Flames or the Jets need two losses. Those are the only situations I understand that the Kings get in.

losangeleskings,31wfsu,yukiyukiyuki,13,Wed Apr 8 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"As a Canucks fan, I can tell you that you're absolutely correct.  I feel bad for how much hate the Kings have been getting this year, but I think people need to understand there's a difference between the kind of ""hate"" directed at the Kings right now, and the kind directed at say, the Boston Bruins. No fan of the playoff-race teams wants to see the Kings in the playoffs because we've seen time and time again what they are capable of - and it's damn scary!  The Kings are such a tough, heavy team, and have so much depth and skill, that it strikes fear into the hearts of fans around the league as they imagine playing them in the playoffs again. We all know the Kings have had a sub-par season this year, but we also know if anybody can sneak in by a ball hair, turn on the jets, and then steam ahead full speed to the cup, it is the Los Angeles Kings.  This is why Operation Regicide exists, and this is why I am praying the Kings don't make the playoffs this year. You guys already have 2 cups in the last few years! Please don't take offense but rather, take it as a compliment. It may feel like hatred directed at the Kings right now but there is still a huge amount of respect in the mix!"
losangeleskings,31wfsu,JimlaRS,10,Wed Apr 8 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel bad for some Kings fans. You guys have an amazing hockey team that wins cups. Your regular season could use a bit of work, but your post-season is phenomenal.   The reason I feel bad for you is because you are all new to this fame. With fame comes envy, and with envy comes the incessant chirping of other fans. Because the Kings are new to this notoriety you fans haven't really developed the thick skin like Bruins/Flyers fans have.   Don't take the trash talking personally or badly. The only reason you are being chirped is because the Kings are so good. Operation Regicide exists because nobody wants to play you in the playoffs, and thats about the biggest compliment you can get.   That said, I still hope we knock you out of the playoffs. Us Flames fans are still pretty nervous, even though we are 2 points up on you with 2 games to go. By all accounts it should be easy for us to make the playoffs, but we are up against the Kings, and thats fucking scary."
losangeleskings,31wfsu,jibbybonk,2,Thu Apr 9 02:04:28 2015 UTC,"How about you let us win, and then we pay Colorado to beat Winnipeg and then you guys beat them on Saturday so we both make it?  The playoffs need Gaudreau."
losangeleskings,31wfsu,Branzilla91,2,Thu Apr 9 02:24:18 2015 UTC,"I hate that it's come down to this between our two teams, I've been pulling for you guys most of the year.

I really do wish you guys the best in whatever time you have left."

losangeleskings,31wfsu,Spiffysack101,4,Thu Apr 9 05:10:54 2015 UTC,Ideally I'm still pulling for LA to grab the wildcard and knock Anaheim out in the first round.
losangeleskings,31wfsu,EinsamWulf,16,Thu Apr 9 15:02:15 2015 UTC,"I think it is important to note that #operationregicide is a cyber fan-made trend. It is not formidable within the NHL and has no causation to the outcomes of these games.   Edmonton did not win because they decided to join operation regicide. They won because the are professional hockey players and their job is to try and win games no matter their situation.   If the kings do not make the playoffs, it will not be because of a cyber-discourse. It will most likely be due to their overtime and shootout losses."
losangeleskings,31wfsu,blahblahwhateverblah,2,Wed Apr 8 18:34:16 2015 UTC,I don't agree with this. I don't think the Blues or Ducks are really icing their best efforts against teams that would keep the Kings out of the playoffs.  I do agree that it is a pointless conversation. The Kings put themselves in this situation.
losangeleskings,31wfsu,lordjedediah,3,Wed Apr 8 20:32:33 2015 UTC,"The Kings put themselves in this situation.    This is exactly what I came here to say. Because at the end, if we have enough points they can't do jack shit to keep us out. And here we are, two games down and if we don't win both of them, we're out.   However, I can't let my tinfoil hat collect dust, so let's put it on and say this: I'm sure that Vancouver or Minnesota didn't play as good as they could against Winnipeg. I'd rather face Winnipeg in post season than Kings."
losangeleskings,31wfsu,Beetush,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:58:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think Vancouver was letting up on Winnipeg by choice.

losangeleskings,31wfsu,BagelzAllDay,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:52:14 2015 UTC,"I've kind of been feeling that way lately at times because of the r/hockey attitude and especially on a lot of posts on hockey facebook pages. I know we're the defending champions and our reputation for squeeking through the playoffs is why a lot of fans want to see us fail, but the resentment that seemingly the rest of NHL fans have for us is pretty disheartening at times. Unfortunately I care too much what other people think, but I simply want others to at least show some level of respect to us."
losangeleskings,31wfsu,garydee119,-19,Thu Apr 9 07:40:25 2015 UTC,"Here is why Operation Regicide exists. This is coming from a Flames fan.  The LA Kings have gone through this season with the cocky expectation that they'd be able to turn it on at the end of the season and make the playoffs. After all, they are God's team, the one true heir to Lord Stanley's cup.   As it turns out, the Kings this season are average at best, with shitty goaltending, and a meh defensive core.   The rest of the league wants the Kings out the playoffs not because we are ""scared"" to play you in the playoffs, but because seeing a cocky team with a fake fanbase miss the post season is extremely satisfying."
losangeleskings,31wfsu,atheistpiece,10,Wed Apr 8 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"Man you are making some HUGE assumptions about how professional hockey players think and act.  Do you honestly believe that the Kings are cocky and they don't try mid-season because they know they'll turn it on at the end of the season!?  If you think that then you are very naive.  They are not cocky in the slightest.  They are workhorses.  They are not the most talented team in the league and I'm sure they know that.  But they don't give up.  That is called persistence, not cockiness.   I'm not even gonna comment about your ""fake fanbase"" comment.  I don't even know what that means."
losangeleskings,31wfsu,Jericho111091,4,Wed Apr 8 20:52:30 2015 UTC,"As far as the fake fans comment goes, my girlfriend's cousin and his wife are definitely fake fans. They moved from Pittsburgh to LA last year at the end of the regular season, going into the playoffs.  When they arrived in LA, the cousin was all about the Penguins. Whenever we were watching a game, regardless of who was playing, he wouldn't shut up about how much better the Penguins were. LA wins the cup, and suddenly, he won't shut up about how much he loves LA and how he's always been a fan. He went out and bought a bunch of Kings hats and some shirts (which is monetarily great for the Kings).  Unfortunately, he isn't a real hockey fan. He doesn't know dick about the Kings (or hockey really). He didn't even know that they played at the staples center.  I'm sure that those kinds of people are a very small portion of the Kings ""fan base"", unfortunately though, they tend to be a very vocal part and make the rest of you folks look bad.  It's not your fault or the Kings fault. Every winning team will pick up bandwagoners. I'm sure whoever wins the cup this year will pick up the same perception going into next year's season."
losangeleskings,31wfsu,garydee119,-14,Wed Apr 8 23:14:48 2015 UTC,"Half of the King's fanbase didn't even know what hockey was before the Kings won against the Devils.

losangeleskings,31wfsu,Fuzzy901,11,Wed Apr 8 21:27:56 2015 UTC,"Is it so strange for a sport to become more popular in a city when their team is winning?  Yes you are correct, this city has generated a LOT of new hockey fans over the past few years.  That is a fantastic thing.  I live here and the vibe is amazing.  Why is it so bad for new people to discover a sport.  If you were a true fan of the sport you would see this as a GOOD thing.  But you are clearly just a child who doesn't know much."
losangeleskings,31wfsu,Beetush,8,Wed Apr 8 21:37:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for joining in the bandwagon hate club. You have no idea what you are mouthing off about. Welcome to L.A., 60%  or more of the population is from somewhere else. Your are just repeating all the same crap that everyone else says just to prove how much of an asshole you are. If you really backed your team, you wouldn't spend so much time on the Kings sub saying a bunch of shit. Every home game since 2011 has been sold out, for the longest sell out streak since the 90-92 streak. There are indeed young new fans who now appreciate the sport and yes that is because they have become more popular in their recent championships. Every game I go to I have met old timers that have been going to games since '67, do you really think L.A. would still have a team if it had no fans that whole time? Head back over to your flames sub and cheer on your shitty team and we will keep cheering on our shitty team that has two cups in the past three years you chump."
losangeleskings,31vrnv,CrispyLardon,3,Wed Apr 8 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"I follow a lot of teams, so there's plenty of players I want to see lift the cup:   Ovechkin Parise Halak Stastny Lundqvist   Mostly Parise and Ovi however. But either way. I'm not counting the Kings out until the results of tomorrow show up. Sadly I'm going to miss the game."
losangeleskings,31vrnv,TheEw0kGamer,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:32:49 2015 UTC,It would be pretty wild to see the Wild win the cup. They are next in line after the Caps for me.

losangeleskings,31vrnv,Albright-N-Shiny,2,Wed Apr 8 23:54:08 2015 UTC,Past few days have changed my view of LA fans.  Had very little exposure to you guys until your cup win.  The fans I came across were mostly of the Manchester Monarch variety and were not exactly the most pleasant.  Was a bit unfair in my rushes to judgment and assumption most fans were of the bandwagon variety.

losangeleskings,31v98l,Sniffman,2,Wed Apr 8 13:02:41 2015 UTC,"So you'd rather be depressed for a longer period of time and still be depressed if they don't make the playoffs, rather than have hope and faith in the team that has won the cup as an 8th seed, reverse swept a team in the playoffs, won two other 7 game series in the same playoffs, won multiple double OT games in the playoffs to win the cup?   I've been a fan for over 20 years. If they don't make the playoffs, yeah I'll be upset, but I won't be depressed. This team brought us two cups. I grew up with the Kings missing the playoffs way too often, or doing nothing in the playoffs. One off year will be annoying but not depressing in the slightest."

Because they forget what this group of players is capable of.   Last year's first round, they pulled off a run that was much more challenging than this. We have two games left vs very beatable teams. Based on this season, we're at the same level as Calgary and better than San Jose so why the fuck are we dismissing these games so easily?   You guys are unbelievable."

Now, it's ""well, if the Kings beat the Flames and Sharks, AND the Jets and Flames lose here and here, then the Kings are in.""

Then assuming the Kings can handle their own biz vs CAL and Sharks, they are in.  I think the only issues within all that will be if WIN/CAL get a point in an OT loss thurs.  But even if they both get that point, a regulation loss in that final game for CAL or WIN would let the kings in with their victory.   Correct me if I'm wrong. But man did they shoot themselves in the foot last night."

We'll see if playoff-mode Kings show up, and maybe they'll do it all again.    If we miss the playoffs, then that will give the Kings time to rest, figure out what's going to happen with Voynov, etc. Also, it will help me not go further into debt as the ""Pay as we Play"" plan won't kick in and I won't have another $800 or whatever hitting my credit card.    Jesse Cohen on ATKM made a good point: as Kings fans, we've been spoiled lately with winning 2 Cups in 3 years."

losangeleskings,31w93i,ozzian,2,Wed Apr 8 19:05:38 2015 UTC,CGY and WPG both lose tonight in regulation and it becomes:   WPG is at 96  CGY is at 95  LAK is at 95   Final game of the season WPG vs CGY and LAK vs SJS:   WPG wins in OT 98 LAK win 97 CGY loses in OT 96   or   CGY wins in OT 97 LAK win 97 WPG loss in OT 97 (LAK has ROW against WPG)   So Kings make it in no matter what if the win both games and WPG loses tonight.
losangeleskings,31w93i,Todrick,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:49:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just passing through, but I agree it doesn't sound right. If Kings win over them, it ties the teams at 95, but Flames have tie break. Then if both Kings and Flames win their final games, still tied, Flames qualify. In this situation, Kings only make it if Jets also lose to Avs."
losangeleskings,31w93i,ozzian,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:54:57 2015 UTC,ok... yes that makes sense.  Had to go at it backwards(chronologically).

That being said I understand why teams spend so much time on you guys. 2 cups in 3 years; nearly 3 in 3 in fact. You guys always seem to enter the playoffs as a low seed and find 8 gears in a 6 gear vehicle; once you're in all teams are literally scared of you guys.

In hindsight, 8-2 blowout was bad and gave Edmonton a reason to fight like they did last night.   Not sure I understand all decisions made in the game... Jones start (sure, it's Edmonton and Quick needs a rest... but it is also a season ""make or break"" game). I don't remember if it was a score right after an icing, but having the 4th line on the ice in the D-zone for the 3rd goal wasn't a ""bright"" moment (if after an icing, it is what it is). Probably other things, but those are the 2 that really stuck out. That and Gabo not netting on the wideopen net (missing the puck completely in the slot). That can't happen.

You had to go through some amazing teams (not just a Ducks homer).  San Jose, Anaheim and Chicago were all very good teams last year.

The only chance for hope right now that I can see is beating the Flames on Thursday and hoping the Jets beat them in their final game. There's probably other outcomes to make it work. But basically we depend on other teams now. We don't control our own destiny and it is really dark looking.

If they lose to the Aves and at best lose in OT to the Flames and we win the next two games, we'll still make it. Also, what you said: beat the Flames in regulation and they lose to the Jets in regulation on Sat. Then we'd still be in, assuming we beat the Sharks on Sat. as well. It's looking bleak."

The Flames aren't going to win the Cup - I don't fear them.  The Kings are an amazing team and extremely unlucky to be in the position they are in.  1-7 in overtime games.  2-8 in shootouts.  Those aren't numbers you'll see again.  The Kings are 36-26 in games decided in regulation.  That's a better measure of their skill.  And you guys probably already know this, but look at LA's stats in advanced measures.  http://stats.hockeyanalysis.com/teamstats.php?disp=1&db=201415&sit=5v5&sort=GFPCT&sortdir=DESC  No. 1 in Corsi,   no. 1 in Fenwick, no.1 in shot ratio, no. 4 in goals ratio.

I feel like there is no in between, mediocrity would have been enough to win enough games to get them into the playoffs. And the lack of creativity in shoot outs in mind boggling, and sticking with the same guys who haven't produced in the shootout is even more puzzling.  You all need to start praying to whatever god you worship, because things don't look good. Do we have a protected lottery pick this year or did it get traded at some point?"

losangeleskings,31s1s2,eric_roberts,22,Tue Apr 7 18:46:21 2015 UTC,I hate this being used as an excuse.
losangeleskings,31s1s2,thegetawayplan9,12,Tue Apr 7 19:46:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it's bullshit. The most dedicated hockey players are training when they're not playing anyway.
losangeleskings,31s1s2,anexanhume,8,Tue Apr 7 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"Even Sutter and Lombardi have mentioned it. The Kings have accomplished incredible things, but there's a price to be paid especially given the physical style of their play."
losangeleskings,31s1s2,thegetawayplan9,5,Tue Apr 7 23:39:49 2015 UTC,Sutter has said a few times that it's not an excuse
losangeleskings,31s1s2,Pen2Paper,9,Tue Apr 7 23:52:21 2015 UTC,"He may say that, but when he talks about playing almost four seasons in the same span that most teams played three, he's saying something, and it's not gloating."

I'd lose motivation if I didnt have that in my life, it would be a pressing mental fatigue after 3 extended seasons."
losangeleskings,31s1s2,thegetawayplan9,3,Tue Apr 7 20:46:04 2015 UTC,Not to mention that this team really barely added new players over the course of these 3 years. The team is only slightly different from the 2012 run.

losangeleskings,31s1s2,mrsambo99,11,Wed Apr 8 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it has anything to do with the boys being out of gas. I think it has everything to do with losing Mitchell and Slava virtually right at the same time. Then we had a plague of blue line injury's on top of it. I mean, it's still no excuse--at all. Since if we don't make the playoffs it will be by 1 or 2 points. Which means it's 100% our fault for not closing out games that were ours dead to rights."
losangeleskings,31s1s2,anonmarmot,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"Quick played very poorly from about games 12-50. So sloppy, letting in average shots and wasnt able to come up with the big save. He's played well since mid-February and we've turned it around as a team. Quick's performance is so goddamn important to LA's success.  *If you really think Quick played great in those games I dont know what you were watching. He was back to overcommitting, leaving holes open, getting beat down low which barely ever happens, and just could not track the puck."

I just don't think it's fair to place all the blame on him when we had major defensive woes this season. But I agree that he wasn't up to par for a few games--just not as many as you are saying. Defense plays a huge part in goalie success."
losangeleskings,31s1s2,KingsfanMDJ,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:35:18 2015 UTC,"I didnt say it was his fault, but he was overcommitting and was not tracking the puck well at all for a considerable amount of time.   I am just as in love with Quick as everybody in LA but to not look at the goalie as a source of poor play is ""head-in-the-clouds."" Kopitar played like shit for quite awhile but because his Corsi numbers were OK nobody wanted to say anything, it's stupid."
losangeleskings,31s1s2,mathonwy,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:43:33 2015 UTC,I agree (I didn't downvote you). You just kinda made it sound like it was all Quick's fault. But I agree--it was a combination of the blue line and Quick for sure. And then on top of that our offense just couldn't get anything in the net this season--again. Which makes me sad since we acquired Carter and Gabo to fix that problem.
losangeleskings,31s1s2,LOUD__NOISES,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:50:32 2015 UTC,"We really are linked to Quick being himself and for a big portion of the year he wasn't even regular season Quick. Our system depends on Quickie stepping up and making the occasional huge save and making all the easy ones. That just wasn't happening that often until after the break. Its not his fault, but if we are going to point out reasons we may not make the playoffs that is definitely one of the reasons."
losangeleskings,31s1s2,Destillat,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Aside from Doughty, your blue line was kind of a shit show against us (no offense).  Regehr with a -4 and Martinez with a -7 c+/-.  Regehr in particular looked pretty bad.  Those that are disagreeing with you severely under-appreciate the shot blocking and poke checking prowess of Willie Mitchell as well as how solid and mobile Voynov is."

losangeleskings,31u63j,shall1313,6,Wed Apr 8 04:25:33 2015 UTC,I think win out and hoping CGY loses to WPG is our best option. It's the only scenario in which we at least control one of the opposing teams games.

losangeleskings,31prbk,CrispyLardon,30,Tue Apr 7 04:52:42 2015 UTC,I just don't understand what they are doing. Obviously I am no fucking shootout expert but god damn make Lack move side to side or something. At least Gaborik came off the boards so there was some hope of getting him off his angle. Kopi and Carter both came straight in and just tried to straight beat him. What happened to Kopi's forehand-backhand between the pads move? what happened to Carters backhand over the pad? Even if the shit doesnt work at least try something besides the wrist shot were seen get stopped all god damn year. We have given away points all year because of this shit and it could very easily keep us out of the playoffs. Fuck.  /rant
losangeleskings,31prbk,CaptainTicklebeard,7,Tue Apr 7 05:03:12 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this the entire year. We weren't this bad in shootouts last season. But for some reason this year, the guys that are attempting shots, mainly Kopitar, and Carter don't do much to make the opposing goalies work. They do exactly what you said, straight down the middle, stick handle, then a stupid wrister that Lack saw the whole way. Not only Lack, but all the goalies that we have seen in the SO. It's really pathetic. Kopi's attempt made me real pissed, at least Carter came in with speed, and Gabo used the side boards to make Lack move. Kopi just skated down the middle, and then used a wrist shot. He looked like he was shooting warm up shots on net with no goalie. He didn't look like he gave a shit about the shootout."
losangeleskings,31prbk,KobeBasedGod24,7,Tue Apr 7 05:14:06 2015 UTC,The real problem all year has been us blowing it during the game and going into OT and shootouts with absolutely no offensive confidence. How many amazing opportunities did we not convert on today? I can think of five off the top of my head.
losangeleskings,31prbk,KingsfanMDJ,5,Tue Apr 7 05:18:39 2015 UTC,He didn't look like he gave a shit about the shootout.    That was the feeling I came away with as well.

losangeleskings,31prbk,chasej805,12,Tue Apr 7 05:08:33 2015 UTC,"Tiffoli - Shore - then williams should be the line .We have absolutely no swag . All we do is send it , never deke or stick handle at all. So upsetting to watch ."
losangeleskings,31prbk,onestrawplease,9,Tue Apr 7 05:11:44 2015 UTC,"I AGREE! It's frustrating watching the guys who have played almost the whole game, and are clearly exhausted, do the shootouts. Toffoli, Shore and Williams would make an amazing lineup for the so."
losangeleskings,31prbk,wiseaus_stunt_double,9,Tue Apr 7 05:25:28 2015 UTC,How I feel right now.
losangeleskings,31prbk,RubeusShagrid,6,Tue Apr 7 05:07:06 2015 UTC,I've thrown a lot of spoons to that movie--good times.   Edit: And now I feel completely stupid that I never made the connection to your name.
losangeleskings,31prbk,wiseaus_stunt_double,3,Tue Apr 7 07:06:35 2015 UTC,So is that you or the real Wiseau?

losangeleskings,31prbk,akat16,5,Tue Apr 7 17:16:44 2015 UTC,"It's like the Kings never practice for these situations. All god damn year, the same tired wrist shots or slappers."
losangeleskings,31prbk,Zanchbot,3,Tue Apr 7 05:49:01 2015 UTC,Thats because they don't. Sutter despises the shootout and refuses to practice it.
losangeleskings,31prbk,LOUD__NOISES,3,Tue Apr 7 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"He may despise it, but it has cost us big time this season. You'd think he could at least concede to that."
losangeleskings,31prbk,Zanchbot,2,Tue Apr 7 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"They've practiced it this year. It's not every practice, but there have been reports. Clearly it's not enough."
losangeleskings,31prbk,csonny2,2,Tue Apr 7 16:30:24 2015 UTC,I just want to see Kopi pull a Forseberg like he used to. Never even attempts anything fancy anymore.
losangeleskings,31prbk,LOUD__NOISES,5,Tue Apr 7 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"I posted this in the GDT, but practicing shootouts was one of the coolest things about playing hockey as a kid.   The kings look utterly depressed to have to out there.   Also don't understand why they don't have Doughty go more often, he has some great hands and might actually try something fancy"
losangeleskings,31prbk,r0botdevil,7,Tue Apr 7 06:32:38 2015 UTC,Or Toff.
losangeleskings,31prbk,DreamcastWriter,2,Tue Apr 7 07:03:43 2015 UTC,I feel like Doughty would just hit a slapper. But he would be better than Kopitar. All he's been doing is a wrist shot. USE THE CAN OPENER!
losangeleskings,31prbk,KingsfanMDJ,5,Tue Apr 7 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"Tonight's was especially bad. It looked almost like they weren't even trying. I feel bad for Quick, too... he only lets one by and we still lose without even going to extra shooters?"
losangeleskings,31prbk,RubeusShagrid,2,Tue Apr 7 08:23:15 2015 UTC,"Typical Kings shootout loss.  Quick lets in 1 goal in nearly 40 shots, then 1 in the shootout and we only walk away with 1 point."
losangeleskings,31prbk,KingsfanMDJ,3,Tue Apr 7 18:26:28 2015 UTC,"I know we got a point, but I'm so fucking bummed right now. We really needed this win...  Someone cheer me up with something!"

losangeleskings,31prbk,Doomhat,5,Tue Apr 7 13:25:13 2015 UTC,I'd rather have 3 on 3 OT in an attempt to diminish the SO.
losangeleskings,31prbk,brutalyak,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how that's any less of a gimmick. What do you see more often in an NHL game, a penalty shot or a 3-on-3 situation?"
losangeleskings,31prbk,dalbtraps,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:41:49 2015 UTC,It makes it less of a chance of a SO. The AHL has been doing it this year. They have seen a major reduction in SO's.
losangeleskings,31prbk,KingsfanMDJ,3,Wed Apr 8 02:42:48 2015 UTC,"I don't get why players don't use their full bag of tricks, or even just a fake shot, deke, back hand type play. All these NHL players and young guys like Toffoli dick around with the puck and are capable of decent fake shots and dekes.    But when it comes time to do it, you just see em cruise in and wrist a lazy shot into the goalie. Even Datsyuk is miserable to watch the last couple years. Dude just back hands it 100% of the time with low success rates lately. And he definitely has moves. Why don't players use their god damn moves"

losangeleskings,31skeb,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,2,Tue Apr 7 21:07:08 2015 UTC,It is because it will literally come down to the last game. In 2012 it came down to the second to last game so this year is a little more stressful.

losangeleskings,31ptao,mikeycamikey10,2,Tue Apr 7 05:21:03 2015 UTC,Are we going to be the NJD of this year? The fact that Tyler Toffoli isn't in the shootout and Kopi still is with a less than 10% success rate is an example of Sutterisms gone bad.
losangeleskings,31ptao,RubyRhod,2,Tue Apr 7 16:15:33 2015 UTC,He was a 40% shooter before this year. It's just been really fucking weird this year for literally everyone.
losangeleskings,31ptao,anexanhume,2,Tue Apr 7 16:48:19 2015 UTC,He and Carter looked like they gave the minimum effort in the shootout last night.  Both skated right in fairly slowly and shot with no move or effort to fake out the goalie or make him make the first move.
losangeleskings,31ptao,DreamcastWriter,2,Tue Apr 7 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"Well it's a good thing there are no shootouts or overtimes in the playoffs. At least not the bizarre 4 on 4 ""we need more scoring in OT"" overtimes.   Now we just need to button up and make it."

losangeleskings,31pr7x,Dr_Mickhead,4,Tue Apr 7 05:16:42 2015 UTC,Nah mine was just some pretty basic smack talk.
losangeleskings,31pr7x,doot_doot,10,Tue Apr 7 05:20:03 2015 UTC,"You make it very difficult for me to not wish failure on the Flames. I'm actually happy they're in and not the Sharks. It's just disappointing there are people like yourself who troll when you really have no good reason to hate the Kings, specifically. You know, since we have your former GM/coach who led you to some success not too long ago... Oh fuck, Kings fans aren't supposed to know that, since we all started following when he was already here... Oops. Well I guess that doesn't stop the Blackhawks or the Sharks from hating us... Oh fuck we're not supposed to know he coached them either. Shit. I mean, ""what's icing?""  Edit: your downvoting buddies don't help."
losangeleskings,31pr7x,sithlordmoore,4,Tue Apr 7 05:55:27 2015 UTC,"Dunno why everyone is so sensitive (well, actually yes I do know) but for what it's worth I thought it was pretty funny."

losangeleskings,31pr7x,Fuzzy901,11,Tue Apr 7 07:29:55 2015 UTC,Thought the Kings would give a fuck in the shootout this late in the year in the situation we are in. FUCKING NOPE. SAME SHIT DIFFERENT TIME OF YEAR.
losangeleskings,31pr7x,Just_a_Gamer,9,Tue Apr 7 04:53:27 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be overly negative, but why are we so horribly terrible at shoot outs this season?   As soon as it goes to a shoot out I already feel like we lost. What changed?"

losangeleskings,31pr7x,TheEw0kGamer,21,Tue Apr 7 04:52:44 2015 UTC,"Canucks fan here, it's absolutely true. When we won back to back presidents everyone hated us, they were probably all cheering for you when you swept us as the 8th seed."
losangeleskings,31pr7x,Lowl58,5,Tue Apr 7 04:57:25 2015 UTC,"There is ""good hate"" and ""bad hate"". The hate for the Kings is good, they know we're good and what we can do. Bad hate, well, hate against the Bruins always seems pretty bad lol. But I agree with you, when your team does really well, people hate you, and it's because you're a threat that they don't want to deal with."
losangeleskings,31pr7x,kansascityqueefs,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:59:57 2015 UTC,They were. But now that we have put together good runs for a few years everyone wants us to fuck off. Yet its not like this team has had its ups and downs like any other; why are we vilified for having the best time in the King's lifespan since the early 90s'?
losangeleskings,31pr7x,nessman930,2,Tue Apr 7 05:04:08 2015 UTC,"We have the potential to win against all 3 of our next opponents. And I really don't want to say this but I think its safe to say that tomorrow night is a guaranteed 2 points.   The game against Calgary is definitely the most important, whoever has that win is one that basically determines the playoff spot  We can only hope the Jets lose tomorrow and we win and that'll put us a point ahead of them. And maybe hope for the Calgary loss against coyotes but um.. we'll see.  What we want in the future basically is  April 7th: Win against Oilers, Jets lose to Blues (pls) Calgary loss to Coyotes (please)  April 9th: Kings win against Calgary (VITAL), Jets loss to Avalanche   April 11th: Win against sharks, Calgary lose to Jets  now this is the absolutely best we can hope for. Also all in regulation  This would put the kings at 99, Jets at 96,  and Calgary at 95"

losangeleskings,31pr7x,heathrawr182,5,Tue Apr 7 04:52:27 2015 UTC,I don't understand why they approach every shootout attempt as if it were some warmup shooting drill. It's frustrating to watch and has put us in a tough position to make the playoffs. Make the goalie move or think or anything for fuck's sake.
losangeleskings,31pr7x,kmad,4,Tue Apr 7 04:54:17 2015 UTC,I hope the Kings know that the post office is closed this late -- you shouldn't be trying to mail stuff in this time of night.

We got a point out of this one. Expecting them to go 6-0 for the rest of the season wasn't realistic. We've got 3 games left. Thursday night is going to be the absolute biggest night of the year.

losangeleskings,31pr7x,sonician,1 point,Tue Apr 7 07:25:44 2015 UTC,This team should be ashamed for letting a team like the Nucks push them around. This is the same team we've manhandled all year and when it counts only Quick stepped up.   Also fuck shootouts.  Edit: ok that was a bit mean but I'm pissed. Nucks are a good team but we've had such good success against them and yet when we really need to win we crap the bed.   Also Doughty really hasn't been the great amazing Dman that people have been talking about. He can't get pucks on net and when he try's to coast to coast it he gets to the top of the circle and loses it every damn time. He really needs to simplify his game. Try a fucking one timer for once instead of a pull and drag that always hits shinpads.
losangeleskings,31pr7x,Courtlessjester,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:56:27 2015 UTC,It wasn't a bad game until the end of it.  It just seems like lately whenever a team takes a lead or ties it late in the game [or just in the third in general] everyone kind of unravels and falls apart and when they start trying to do damage control the effort comes just a biiit too late.
losangeleskings,31pr7x,xzElmozx,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:58:20 2015 UTC,It was bad after the first 10 minutes. We played like horseshit. Kopi looked terrible. We got a lucky goal and then Quick did his best despite out shitty play.
losangeleskings,31pr7x,shorthanded,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:18:26 2015 UTC,"That was the one game they could ""probably"" afford to lose. It sucks it ended up how it did. Now, if they can win the next three games, they'll end up with 99 points, which will be enough to put them in.   Heck even going 2-0-1 the rest of the way guarantees a playoff spot (98 points, better ROW) , no matter what Winnipeg does from this point."

losangeleskings,31u30t,Ahland3r,2,Wed Apr 8 04:01:12 2015 UTC,Statistically it's going to be tough but you're going to need a lot of help but you can get a max of 97 points so calgary has to lose out and you need to win out

losangeleskings,31p9bx,KobeBasedGod24,3,Tue Apr 7 04:28:16 2015 UTC,1 pt and we're tied with Calgary and 1pt behind Winnipeg. Calgary has the tiebreaker. So technically out of the playoffs.

Let's assume we beat Edmonton and Calgary beats Arizona tommorow, that puts us both at 96. Then thursday we play each other. As long as we win we have 98 to their 96 going into one game left on Saturday. At that point all we gotta do is win. (Now for wildcard analysis that's beyond my pay grade)  Edit: the one question I have is say we beat Calgary Thursday, do they still win the tie breaker? Because that may be important."
losangeleskings,31pt6d,mikeycamikey10,2,Tue Apr 7 05:15:39 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter that the Flames own the tiebreaker. If we beat them, we pass them by at least one point."
losangeleskings,31pt6d,CrispyLardon,2,Tue Apr 7 05:44:47 2015 UTC,For you to pass us or the jets you need 1 more point than either since you have the tiebreak vs the Jets but we have the tiebreak vs you.

If us and the Flames win tonight, we stay even, which is fine--even if we win in OT. But we play the Flames after that. We win that, we move ahead, even if it's a three point game after regulation. So then we just need to get two points off the Sharks.  So basically, two points a night, no matter if it's regulation or OT. The only way we catch the Jets again is if they lose to the Blues tonight. But really, I think we need to ignore wild card and focus on the third spot, since the Jets/Flames have their last game together.

losangeleskings,31oopp,KnightNight-,4,Mon Apr 6 23:17:04 2015 UTC,"To be honest? I can't stand him. Sure he hits hard, but he gets blown past a lot due to his lack of speed, which is simply a side affect of age, and he lacks any movement along the blue line in the O-zone. He has been missing a lot of defensive coverages lately as well as turning the puck over which is frustrating for such an experienced player. I know he is one of the veteran leaders in the locker room, but just knowing that he is in while the better defenseman in Brayden McNabb is being scratched makes me so mad. Let's put it this way: he is the only player to make Doughty have poor possession numbers, which is saying A LOT. I liked him when we first got him because Mitchell and Greene were both out with injury and I wanted that defensive defenseman that hits hard. But now that his contract is up at the end of the year, I can't wait until he is signed with a different team/retired.  I am happy that our two boys are doing well in your guy's system though. Fasching and Deslouiers (spelling?) were likable prospects, they just wouldn't have been given the time in our system due to others guys being ahead of them (ie Toffoil, Pearson, Vey, Weal, Shore). Heck, Vey was a great prospect and we had to trade him away simply because we didn't have room for him."
losangeleskings,31oopp,BlueApple10,7,Tue Apr 7 00:30:21 2015 UTC,"Uhhhh....  Pretty sure we got Big Rig from Buffalo....which makes your question curious to me...  But, I'll bite...  Reggie is a beast at the blue line, but he's a bit....uh.....experienced.  He can get beat by speedier guys and has a knack for either missing a check or misplaying the puck and puts his D partner in a rough spot.  I was thinking this morning that once Dr. Drej comes back, I hope he takes Robyn's spot, because Sekera + Martinez - Regehr = much better defense IMO.  But....he does have his plusses....he hits like a big rig.  He can take the body and plays very well within the Kings system.  Solid locker room guy too, from what I've read.    My .02"
losangeleskings,31oopp,sandypheet,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:42:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure we got Big Rig from Buffalo    You did, back in 2011-2012.  Defensemen can change quite a lot in just a couple of years and with new scenery though so I thought I'd ask. I honestly wouldn't be super surprised to see quite a few of our key pieces that we moved out to make the Tank get looks for coming back once we're trying to win again.  Regehr is 34, but since I never hear anything about him I was hoping it might be because he's a solid player that doesn't make many mistakes."

losangeleskings,31oopp,LAKingBob,2,Tue Apr 7 20:05:55 2015 UTC,"He gets quite a bit of frustrated jabs here but I don't mind him too much.  I think he's pretty solid when he has the puck.  Whereas Muzzin will pass the puck to the other team once every few games or so.    Obviously with his age, he is a bit slow so players will usually pass by him in the defensive zone.    I have faith in Reghr, he's a beast that'll take players off the puck (assuming he's close to them and they don't have room to skate around him) and doesn't seem to make bad passes that ends up hurting the team.  There's a reason why Reghr was on the top defensive pairing with Doughty for a good chunk of the season instead of Muzzin."
losangeleskings,31oopp,chasej805,2,Tue Apr 7 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"Personally I am not the most avid fan of him. Draws some penalty, somewhat slow, also doesn't ever seem to do a whole lot in the offensive zone Robby only has 3 goals this season and 13 points. Pros are he hits like a freight train at times. But overall I wouldn't be sad to see him go."
losangeleskings,31oopp,OverlordKopi_2037,2,Tue Apr 7 00:37:19 2015 UTC,"He's lost a step and some of the hockey sense he may have had. He can be a good supporting stay back D-man at times with our younger defensemen, but he doesn't offer very much anymore. He's cost us some bad goals, but it's not just been him to be fair. I'd rather have Scuderi or Mitchell, but it is what it is. Gotta love when he goes Big Rig mode though, and just brick-walls the young, unsuspecting speedsters in the league."
losangeleskings,31oopp,ToastedFireBomb,2,Tue Apr 7 00:54:27 2015 UTC,"He's been horrible lately. I'd honestly rather he get benched and McBain get the start until Sekera comes back. He's slow as fuck, terrible at puck handling, and generally great at causing turnovers. He makes Doughty look really bad, and that bugs the hell out of me. Only upside is he can hit, but so can every other fucking defensman we have. I am very done with Big Rig."
losangeleskings,31oopp,thegetawayplan9,2,Tue Apr 7 05:30:25 2015 UTC,he's old and slow. He's deteriorated since you traded him here. I like him but he's a shell of himself.
losangeleskings,31oopp,Pen2Paper,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:15:59 2015 UTC,He's a Big Rig and I've been a fan since he came in. Hell he's got almost as many goals a Doughty this year. But the guys is closer to retirement than a new contract.

Plus, we play at Edmonton the next day, Calgary on Thurs (another 4pt game) before our last regular season game vs. SJS.  That's 6 points aside from the 2 they'll earn Monday night.  Believe"
losangeleskings,31k5bw,sandypheet,11,Sun Apr 5 21:43:42 2015 UTC,admittedly you guys have owned us in the recent past but last game I think might have reset that trend a bit. I think the game is going to be a rockin one no matter what.

losangeleskings,31k5bw,LAKingBob,5,Mon Apr 6 00:18:00 2015 UTC,I think you have a point but I'm sure the Kings are more desperate for those points than the Canucks are.  Canuck may want those points to keep the Kings out of the playoffs however ;).
losangeleskings,31k5bw,LAKingBob,3,Sun Apr 5 21:57:40 2015 UTC,"True but the Canucks have lost their last 2 and it is disconcerting. The game in winnipeg was spirited, fast flying and gun wheeling but the result was not good. I think the Canucks have to win tomorrow in order to prove to themselves they are ready for the playoffs and numerically they can still miss. Though it seems unlikely.  <br> also, your name is LAKingBob but you have a 'lanche flair. Colour me confused."
losangeleskings,31k5bw,CrispyLardon,3,Sun Apr 5 22:02:35 2015 UTC,"I'll address the flair first:  About a couple of weeks ago, /r/hockey had a user draft where fans from NHL team subs came together and participated in a mock draft.  I believe the purpose of the draft was to help exposed hockey fans to other teams.  I was drafted by the Avalanche sub.  Here's a link of our roster, who we drafted and who went to what sub:   http://redd.it/2znc5q  And you do have a point about the Canucks needing to prove they're playoffs ready but they're not the only ones.

losangeleskings,31hqyz,herpaderpder,9,Sun Apr 5 05:34:29 2015 UTC,"Just my 10 cents.  I feel we have a chance, we are the comeback Kids. Who's the team that was down 3 games and didn't loose 4 straight in the play offs? Kings. Who's the team that beat the Ducks in 7 games? Kings. Who's the team that beat the hawks in overtime game 7? Kings. Who beat the Rangers in double overtime? LA Kings.  I still firmly believe that the Kings can make it and WILL."

losangeleskings,31hopd,hobonia,9,Sun Apr 5 04:25:14 2015 UTC,How about multi-point Regehr?
losangeleskings,31hopd,dallenhill,11,Sun Apr 5 05:45:37 2015 UTC,Superstar Scoring Sensation Robyn Regehr.
losangeleskings,31hopd,Rando_Thoughtful,12,Sun Apr 5 06:27:01 2015 UTC,That was the most lopsided 3-1 game I have seen in a long time. I think we held the puck for three or four straight shifts in the third
losangeleskings,31hopd,TheLastGarrison,2,Sun Apr 5 04:25:55 2015 UTC,"The second was definitely not as nice, though. That's not gonna go well for us in the playoffs."
losangeleskings,31hopd,Zanchbot,10,Sun Apr 5 06:09:36 2015 UTC,Great win. Now spend next practice shooting on an empty net.
losangeleskings,31hopd,Nougatizer,12,Sun Apr 5 04:24:12 2015 UTC,Morale at an all time low in kings locker room after going 0 for 200 on an empty net
losangeleskings,31hopd,WoozleWuzzle,8,Sun Apr 5 04:30:41 2015 UTC,Pretty complete win. We needed it.
losangeleskings,31hopd,lordjedediah,9,Sun Apr 5 04:23:22 2015 UTC,"That was incredible! Sutter needs to keep Williams on the first line, he is way more effective there and is the best match with Kopi and Gabbo since Carter was with the two."
losangeleskings,31hopd,WoozleWuzzle,9,Sun Apr 5 04:23:55 2015 UTC,The Kings are keeping us in the hunt with two big wins. But let's remember we're beating really bad teams.   If we can win Monday that'll be HUGE. Canucks are an actual formidable opponent.
losangeleskings,31hopd,KeshasBiggestFan,2,Sun Apr 5 04:35:03 2015 UTC,"Are they though? I mean, they beat the Kings the last time they played them but wasn't it like 7-0-1 or something ridiculous prior to that?"
losangeleskings,31hopd,wiseaus_stunt_double,6,Sun Apr 5 04:40:59 2015 UTC,"They're not as bad as the Oilers, but they're not great either. Definitely a team a Stanley Cup contending team should beat."

Regardless, we still control our destiny -- we win the next five, and we're in the playoffs regardless of what happens to the rest of the league.

Vancouver win would put us at 94 and if we win the remaining 3 games we beat Vancouver by one point."

losangeleskings,31c9dy,deruch,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:08:36 2015 UTC,I love figuring out standings and obscure rules and the like. I'm really curious to see what happens if a team is tied after coming down to goal differential.  ONE GAME PLAYOFF?!
losangeleskings,31c9dy,paulkardos,0,Sun Apr 5 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is due to ROW.  Currently, the Kings are 4 ahead in ROW, so that ends it.  No need to look at season series points or goal differential, those are only considered if the teams are tied on ROW."

losangeleskings,31d83x,OrangieTheGoldfish,7,Fri Apr 3 23:35:31 2015 UTC,Can we all just take a moment and thank the DoPS for actually putting forth an effort against dirty plays by making and example of Big Buff. Time after time players were given a slap on the wrist because they didn't actually injure a player but that isn't the point. Buff could have ended Miller's NHL career and quite possibly changed his life forever. It of course helps out the Kings' playoff chances as well but I definitely wasn't expecting a 4-game suspension. Hopefully after last night's win the Kings have switched gears to full-throttle playoff mode.
losangeleskings,31d83x,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,2,Sat Apr 4 01:20:15 2015 UTC,"Normally it feels kind of wrong to beat out another team for a playoff spot or to even win a game because a key player isn't participating.   But, that's because it's normally due to injury.   This time, fuck it. I'll love it. Because he deserves that four games to sit at home and watch his team miss the playoffs."
losangeleskings,31d83x,RubeusShagrid,2,Sat Apr 4 02:18:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should be thanking the DoPS for doing their job and watching out for player safety.  While it may contribute to the downfall of WPG and help the Kings make playoffs, what Buff did was completely inexcusable.    Now it is all in the Kings' hands now and see if they're able to take advantage of the opportunity of this situation.  We all saw what the Kings can do and blow their chances this past year."
losangeleskings,31d83x,LAKingBob,2,Sat Apr 4 09:40:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's hard for me to thank the DoPS for their decision. That hit on miller was so unnecessary and dangerous, I was expecting a 6 game suspension with possible playoff suspension games as well, at the very least. That cross-check could have put Miller in a wheelchair, four games isn't even the rest of their season. The DoPS is notoriously inconsistent and it needs to figure out a better way of handling penalties."
losangeleskings,31d83x,ToastedFireBomb,2,Sat Apr 4 20:05:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is exactly what I have in my predictions. Hopefully we're right."
losangeleskings,31bknw,WoozleWuzzle,16,Fri Apr 3 16:02:44 2015 UTC,I vote for the Triple Crown line and That 70's line--Kinger included.  My reasoning is our 70's line has kept us going this year. They deserve some spotlight.
losangeleskings,31bknw,CrispyLardon,2,Fri Apr 3 16:25:48 2015 UTC,"I like this for the current players, Toffoli gives us the rustle effect that Brown gave us and without that line's production we're looking at a much nastier path to the playoffs."
losangeleskings,31bknw,Destillat,2,Fri Apr 3 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"I like this idea!  But we can only have 3 current players and 4-5 historic players so for that 70's line, are we going with Pearson or King?"
losangeleskings,31bknw,LAKingBob,3,Fri Apr 3 20:01:21 2015 UTC,Pearson. Gotta stick to the original.

losangeleskings,31bknw,CrispyLardon,2,Fri Apr 3 21:45:12 2015 UTC,I'm definitely in favor of this one. Plus it gives us some fresh faces to work with for the banner.
losangeleskings,31bknw,TheEw0kGamer,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:02:50 2015 UTC,We should include quick w/ our current players. He's saved many games.
losangeleskings,31bknw,pikay93,2,Fri Apr 3 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we can only have three current players and he was on it last year."
losangeleskings,31bknw,CrispyLardon,12,Fri Apr 3 21:45:35 2015 UTC,My suggestion would be having Carter/Doughty on there this time. Maybe keep the captain up to rustle the jimmies.   Probably add Rob Blake in the legends. Any other legends swaps?
losangeleskings,31bknw,hopesfail,5,Fri Apr 3 16:04:13 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with Brownie for maximum rustle. Carts and Doughty with the add of Blake works as well. You are on the right track.

losangeleskings,31bknw,RichieCski,8,Fri Apr 3 18:39:35 2015 UTC,Oooo. I could put Martinez with Jazz hands on there.

Painful to watch and everybody knew it, the Kings weren't celebrating and even Based Bob and Jim sounded uncomfortable, so I can only imagine how Scrivs and Bunz felt. Do they have twitter handles? I think it would be cool for a bunch of us to show support, Scrivs is always going to be a King at heart and that is a really rough way to start for a rookie. Edit: @tylerbunz and @ben_scrivens for anybody that wants them"

losangeleskings,319s8s,herpaderpder,2,Fri Apr 3 05:27:55 2015 UTC,download ghostery and adblock man! never deal with those trackers or popups again.  the best quality option atm is the lazyman vlc method if you have the bandwith to stream the 5k stream. check it out here  ragecenter isn't a bad option just hit or miss on getting it started most of the time. it's basically a web based vlc method.

losangeleskings,319s8s,KingsfanMDJ,3,Fri Apr 3 22:27:08 2015 UTC,I was doing the VLC methond for a while but it started doing this horrible freeze for a good 15 seconds all game. And I mean like every 10 or so seconds it would do this. Tried all the fixes I could think of and all the ones I could find online and nothing fixed it.   Haven't run into any issues with ragecenter yet. Except the whole having to reload it a few times here and there to get the feed to start.
losangeleskings,319s8s,herpaderpder,1 point,Fri Apr 3 22:33:47 2015 UTC,that type of error is usually caused by having a 64 bit system and vlc installing 32 bit by default. could that be the issue?

To not do so puts him at risk for the longevity of his career. One of his best attributes is his speed, a blown wheel will hinder that greatly.   Also, he's been out for awhile now... even with skating and some conditioning I don't know he'd be at his best for the end of the year push/playoffs anyway. He's young, so that is a factor (as it's a bit easier to get back to such a condition a bit easier, as the body regenerates quicker in most cases). However, throwing him into these types of games coming off an injury and not having been playing is tough to say the least. I can't say it would be worth the risk.   That said... is there any updates on Stoll? Last I read, he was skating/looking better, but this was about a week ago."

I believe we're pretty much gonna get Vancouver or Anaheim. I don't have a preference between the two. We can beat both in a 7 game series if we play up to our potential.

AND THAT WAS LIKE 10 FUCKING YEARS AGO!!! This is seriously stupid. I thought Sutter was actually smart, and I respected him, but this is just a fucking slap in the face to the fans. What about Jones?? Can you seriously argue that Jones isn't better than Fukufuji?? You're fucking so dumb if you agree with this decision. Wow I am so done with this team and this season. What's next... they decide to make that POS dirtbag Brown the Captain?"

losangeleskings,316wnv,Omnivirus,6,Thu Apr 2 13:54:26 2015 UTC,The cup. Just so I could literally hold it over my Islanders fan brother and my Ranger fan buddy.   I would so be that guy.

losangeleskings,316wnv,thegetawayplan9,7,Thu Apr 2 16:41:09 2015 UTC,"I'll weigh in.  Option 2. No hesitation. I think this team is gassed and I think we definitely get out of 1 or 2 rounds, but the slog in the WC is too much to ask of them again. We've played 4 seasons of hockey in 3 years. It's not a skill or 'want' issue- it's just a fatigue thing.  Now, you tell me that we get the next Sidney Crosby, our guys get a full offseason to recuperate, and we return with mostly the same squad as the last 3 years next year, but with the #1 overall draft pick? I'm taking it.   Think about it- you move El Jefe up to the first line with Gabbo and Kopi. You get Connor on the second line with Pearson and Top Tits.   OMG I'M SO AROUSED.  Ok, back to reality. We're making the playoffs."
losangeleskings,316wnv,WoozleWuzzle,4,Thu Apr 2 17:13:41 2015 UTC,Option 1.   We won't win the lottery.

losangeleskings,316wnv,evarga,3,Thu Apr 2 19:35:43 2015 UTC,I'll take the Draft Pick. We can win 3 straight after that. Seriously players like McDavid don't come around often and if I'm not guaranteed a title then it ain't worth it. Honestly even if it were guaranteed I would probably take the pick. Gotta keep the future stocked.
losangeleskings,316wnv,BW4LL,7,Thu Apr 2 15:22:13 2015 UTC,The /r/hockey meltdown would be epic.

losangeleskings,316wnv,akat16,2,Thu Apr 2 17:12:59 2015 UTC,option 1. cuz the cup
losangeleskings,316wnv,rockkon,2,Thu Apr 2 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"Option 1. no hesitation. We are too good of a playoff team to just say fuck it and try to tank. There is a reason the rest of /r/hockey hates us and wants us to fail, because at the end of the day we are the ones with a parade. Pure and simple we are the best team come mid-April and they are trembling in fear of the idea of facing the Defending Stanley Cup Champs. Go Kings Go!!"
losangeleskings,316wnv,KingsfanMDJ,2,Thu Apr 2 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"Option 1, then let Dean work his magic and snag McDavid at the trade deadline."

This is our last solid cup contention year for a few years. If we lose in the post season that's it for a while.

losangeleskings,3148p9,thegetawayplan9,2,Wed Apr 1 22:03:16 2015 UTC,I would imagine they pretty much have to re-sign Sekera if they can afford to do so

losangeleskings,3148p9,thegetawayplan9,2,Wed Apr 1 22:41:21 2015 UTC,but we can't afford to do so since voynov's contract will still be around.

losangeleskings,3148p9,drcujo,3,Wed Apr 1 22:09:16 2015 UTC,There really should be some recourse for the kings here. Regardless of the outcome of the trial he will never be an LA king again.
losangeleskings,3148p9,Doomhat,3,Wed Apr 1 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"Every time this happens I can't help but think it's the DA trying to wait out Voynov.    They bet that Voynov wouldn't lose a season and would take a deal.  They got a trial date right before the playoffs betting that he would try to make it back for the playoffs.  Now I feel like they (the DA) know they're screwed.  If the judge comes back and says that the wife won't be compelled to testify, case if pretty well over right there.  I don't know if he's guilty and I doubt that we will ever find out."

losangeleskings,314yxj,mifitso,5,Thu Apr 2 01:07:03 2015 UTC,"Like what that other guy said, warm ups start half hour before puck drop. You can actually go down into the lower bowl (section 100s) and get pretty much all the way up to the glass to watch them warm up."

Bailey will be around Staples, I'm not sure if there's a trick to running into him. Maybe someone here knows. I also don't know any tricks about meeting players at the game. At Toyota Center maybe, after a practice, but IDK about the game."
losangeleskings,314yxj,wiseaus_stunt_double,4,Thu Apr 2 01:51:41 2015 UTC,Usually an hour before warm-ups and 1.5 hours before puck drop.

You can also try the main concourse. There's usually a Kings Care Foundation or Baileys Buddies booth somewhere.  Don't forget to check out the statues in Star Plaza (Luc's new one especially) and try to get on Kings Live after the game LOL Have fun!"
losangeleskings,314yxj,Vanwoozles,2,Thu Apr 2 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"You could try reaching out to Bailey via his twitter account (@BaileyLAKings).  He seems pretty responsive to people and if you are coming all the way from Australia, he may try to let you know how to meet him."

We had tied it up at 1 in the 2nd period and NJ scored 4 goals in 10 minutes (including 3 in 1:08). I remember that was the first game this season that I was legitimately pissed off at this team.

losangeleskings,30zfp3,Destillat,10,Tue Mar 31 22:59:18 2015 UTC,"I think the concern is the way they played against MIN and CHI, they did not play with the intensity of a team hungry to make the playoffs."
losangeleskings,30zfp3,csonny2,10,Tue Mar 31 23:45:50 2015 UTC,In the game vs the wild the kings had a bad first ten minutes.  I think the rest of the game they played well.  The blocked shot on the PP and Dubnyk's play won the wild the game.  Last night I think the Hawks played pretty well.  They held back our forecheck well.  The kings did look tired and like they weren't trying but we do the same thing to teams sometimes.
losangeleskings,30zfp3,drcujo,6,Wed Apr 1 00:50:17 2015 UTC,"If I'm being totally honest:  I agree, and I think if we match up against any decent team (read: everyone) in the playoffs, we're fucked. But I've also seen this team do incredible shit when they're backed into a corner.  And even failing that, qualifying and going out in the first round while battered and bruised is a hell of a lot better than not even making it."
losangeleskings,30zfp3,csonny2,6,Tue Mar 31 23:56:02 2015 UTC,qualifying and going out in the first round   Then we would at least have one more thing to hold over the sharks.
losangeleskings,30zfp3,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,3,Wed Apr 1 00:21:12 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm just afraid they'll pass us. I know it seems crazy but living in the Bay Area I would hate every day going into work surrounded by Sharks fans.
losangeleskings,30zfp3,RichieCski,4,Wed Apr 1 00:41:26 2015 UTC,It's pretty hilarious to watch up here right now. Everybody is starting to conveniently stop being Sharks fans and just talking Giants Giants Giants now
losangeleskings,30zfp3,flybyknight,0,Wed Apr 1 04:13:21 2015 UTC,"But I thought they had true, loyal fans?"
losangeleskings,30zfp3,RichieCski,3,Wed Apr 1 15:59:50 2015 UTC,AUTHENTIC FANS ONLY
losangeleskings,30zfp3,loginlogan,2,Wed Apr 1 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"True but we looked great against the Rangers and the Islanders who have played some of the best hockey of any team this season and we dominated both of them. Minnesota we looked okay but definitely a drop off and in Chicago the club just looked sluggish. I think maybe fatigue was a factor. This was a tough road trip, a lot of travel and not a lot of days in between games. I honestly think you chalk the last two performances up to fatigue. Having a few days off while being home will certainly help. I expect the team to make a big rebound. I have full confidence."
losangeleskings,30zfp3,phiroth,3,Wed Apr 1 02:29:07 2015 UTC,After listening to the All the Kings Men podcast today I'm gonna start having nightmares about barely making the playoffs only to be knocked out by a Flames-Jets OT finish.
losangeleskings,30zfp3,ProgHippie,3,Wed Apr 1 02:29:13 2015 UTC,don't forget that we also still play against CGY. I'm banking on this much more right now than on the wildcard spot.
losangeleskings,30zfp3,JJinVenice,2,Wed Apr 1 10:15:28 2015 UTC,"I'm surprisingly calm about this whole situation.  If we don't make the playoffs, they'll have to sit back and watch the playoffs and be a tad embarrassed. Not a lot, since there were some unexpected missing personnel this season. But they'll get their rest, and the team will get a chance at a high draft pick. And perhaps they'll finally play the next regular season with more consistency and slot themselves into a playoff position early in the season and hold it. It would be lovely to be a top 4 team and not have to worry these last few weeks."

losangeleskings,31030l,joshhadaspaceshuttle,3,Wed Apr 1 01:53:52 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure most [all?] of us have faith in the team. It isn't like we have jumped ship however if the games against the Wild and particularly against Chicago are like a preview of what the rest of our season and potential post season look like that is freaking terrifying and it is probably a good thing we don't have ours heads in the clouds 'We won the cup last year~~~ We'll definitely make the play offs~~~' because that is unrealistic.  If we looked at Chicago and Wild as 2 games of a 7 game series we'd possibly be dead in the water, like deader than being down 3 games to none.  That said a curious thing is why, and we all speculate about that a lot. Why is our season so hot and cold? More than usual with this core for sure  not many people would argue that.  Except I think it is EXACTLY that. It is our core.  This Kings we have now are kind of like a pack of wolves or dogs in my mind. There is a pack and family mentality and that most of our guys stay together and have been together for a long time is what I'd like to consider a reason for the over drive they go into come play offs, because they know when they can lean on and pressure each other. That is also the biggest change we've had this season.  Mitchell, Voynov which has far more emotions involved, Martinez was out for quite a while all together, Richards was sent down, Pearson broke his ankle, Stoll is out, there have been other shorter term injuries. Sekera is now hurt, McNabb and McBain were sudden new guys to get used to though I think they did fine settling down over all.  A lot of our pieces have been pulled off the chess board this season, some at the same time, some seemingly permanently and all of them sudden save for Mitchell.  On top of long seasons and being tired I speculate it is getting to them because there is a lot more adjusting that had to be gotten used to on the fly which isn't entirely normal for our boys.  Throw a wrench into a bunch of functioning cogs and they might still continue turning at first- but then the wrench gets stuck until it is removed or the machine muscles through the jam. We're going to be stuck until whatever issues we're having are solved  over the post season and through training or they're going to push through it and go out with a bang at some point."

losangeleskings,30yq76,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,2,Tue Mar 31 20:00:43 2015 UTC,It's a nice statistic but it makes me feel even worse if we do miss the playoffs.  I'm just really down and pessimistic right now.
losangeleskings,30yq76,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,7,Tue Mar 31 21:01:27 2015 UTC,"After last years incredible playoff run, I'm incapable of feeling pessimistic about the Kings. They have beaten the odds over and over again and until they're officially eliminated from the playoff race, I will continue to believe they will win it all.   These guys are the toughest, most resilient group of players I've ever seen across all sports. They will find a way and they will continue to shock and awe until the trophy is safely secured for the next 12 months."
losangeleskings,30yq76,bryan_sensei,2,Tue Mar 31 22:42:18 2015 UTC,Without a doubt but I learned in school to set your expectations low that way if you meet them you're fine but if you exceed them your ecstatic.
losangeleskings,30yq76,Destillat,4,Tue Mar 31 23:08:26 2015 UTC,"The same used to be said for Larry Robinson...then he coached for LA and they missed the playoffs. It's not looking good right now, but it ain't over til it's over."
losangeleskings,30yq76,CrispyLardon,5,Tue Mar 31 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, all we need is:   Winnipeg to lose to NYR tonight Beat EDM on Thursday   Then we're back in the playoffs and just need to hold on to that over the course of the last 5 games. Plus, loser point aside, someone has to lose the CGY vs WPG game on 4/11, which means if we beat the Sharks that night we make up at least one point on one of those teams."
losangeleskings,30yq76,thegetawayplan9,2,Tue Mar 31 22:55:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I think this fact inspires confidence that if there is a motivation, lineup or other factor that the coach has influence over, Darryl probably knows how to change it for the better."
losangeleskings,30yq76,CrispyLardon,4,Tue Mar 31 20:09:00 2015 UTC,"We need to go 5-1 in our last games. And we can do that for sure--we just need to beat the Flames and have the option to drop a game to the Nucks. But hell, we can easily go 6-0 against these teams if we get our heads out of our assess.   Two Oilers games, Avalanche, Sharts--I mean Sharks, Flames, Nucks. It's 100% doable, but it's probably going to come down to our Flames game."
losangeleskings,30yq76,Zanchbot,7,Tue Mar 31 20:44:28 2015 UTC,We need to clinch on game 81. Sharks will do everything to spoil that last game for us.

We know what we're getting with the guys you mentioned an Pearson being out isn't good but the Kings have traded a lot of assets over last 2 years to keep a contending team. There is not a wealth of talent in the pipeline whereas 3-4 years ago we were one of the youngest teams by average.
losangeleskings,30xrqe,inalasahl,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"We have plenty of talent in the pipeline — in Manchester where it belongs. (Congrats to the Monarchs on being the first team to clinch a playoff spot in the AHL this season!) Show me a team that's got a lot of players under 24 already playing for them, and I'll show you a team that's rebuilding. The Kings, on the other hand, can afford to let their youngsters develop."
losangeleskings,30xrqe,dalbtraps,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:01:43 2015 UTC,"The stat is misleading. A lot of our younger guys (Shore, Andreoff, McNabb) are 3rd/4th line grinders or defenseman of course they aren't going to produce at a high capacity. If you get 3rd line minutes you're not going to produce as much as a 1st or 2nd liner. Also the Kings aren't a high scoring team to begin with the system revolves around low scoring and tight checking."
losangeleskings,30xrqe,lordjedediah,3,Tue Mar 31 20:42:24 2015 UTC,How many players do the Kings have under 24?
losangeleskings,30xrqe,banksy_,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:34:45 2015 UTC,"Pearson, Toffolli, Andreoff, and Nick Shore. Cliffy and McNabb are both 24, idk if they counted them as well."
losangeleskings,30xrqe,banksy_,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:55:45 2015 UTC,that doesn't change the fact that they're under the age of 24 and on the Kings roster.

losangeleskings,30vzpy,Fuzzy901,4,Tue Mar 31 03:50:12 2015 UTC,"With the way we're playing, San Jose can pass us. Do I think they will, no, but it's definitely a possibility. And if that happens, I'll curl up and die in my apartment up here in the Bay Area because I won't hear the end of it at work."
losangeleskings,30vzpy,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,3,Tue Mar 31 13:36:41 2015 UTC,"Way we're playing? Sure the game against Chicago was a bit tough to watch (and, with the way Chicago has been, that is a winnable game to say the least, but Chicago does tend to give the Kings trouble), but it was also game 5 on the road. And, we have a very favorable schedule the rest of the way. The only game that looks like it will be a really rough one would be Calgary (likely the swing from this game will determine someone's season). Edmonton twice, and though they've been winning lately, they sure as Hell don't want to be if they can avoid it. Vancouver? They can give the Kings trouble, but so far this season, we've had their number in general. The Avalanche have been struggling lately, and are rapidly approaching their loss of playoff contention. In fact, the game they have against the Kings may be a decider. This may mean they go hard. It also may mean pulling the goalie in a tie game in the 3rd or something. In any event, this is a game the Kings can win. Last game of the year? The Sharks. Sure, they may want to play ""spoiler,"" but they may also just want to get the season over with.   That said, we are far from out of things. Sure the two points would've been nice, but we're not done yet. At the very least, these next 6 games are going to be extremely exciting. Definitely playoff atmosphere like (sadly, some of the opponents may not play that way). Also, it'll be good to pay attention to current prognosis of Stoll and Pearson."
losangeleskings,30vzpy,IgoRStripes,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"We wont beat Edmonton if we can't score more than one goal on 35 shots, which is fucking typical Kings this year. Our offense is sparse, pathetic, and comes in short bursts. With Sekera going down our defense, is again, anemic and weaker than it already is. I honestly think we lose one of the Edmonton games, the game against calgary and the game against the Avs. Playing like we have over the course of this season, that pretty much fits the MO. Not to mention we have Mike ""I belong in the AHL"" Richards weighing us down on the back end of our line-up, and Dustin ""it's been 20 games since i've scored"" Brown not contributing offensively. Shore hasn't been anything special either. The only players who've been showing up night after night consistently are Quick, Kopi, and maybe Sekera and Doughty. Other than that it's been all over the place."

I don't know of anyone or anything other than a goal that can get the crowd so excited and so amped up to be in that arena.   It's really great to see your excitement and belief in the team.

Kings didn't play well, but, if you bother to notice instead of throwing tantrums, Chicago played really well. They clogged all the passing lanes and fore-checked like crazy. If not for Quick, they'd have several more goals. Doughty was bad, the entire defense was bad. Too many loose guys around the net. ugh.  Something is off this year. We may need the kick in the teeth to be stronger next year. Maybe it will be quicker than that, and we can sneak in the playoffs. Then shit gets real."

losangeleskings,30vvuf,SoCalWingFan,5,Tue Mar 31 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"I come in peace.  Don't be so down, man. The remaining schedule isn't that bad: Oilers Avs Canucks Oilers Flames Sharks  Those last 2 games are pivotable but not all hope is lost."
losangeleskings,30vvuf,Sniffman,3,Tue Mar 31 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"I could have stomached the loss if I felt like the Kings even showed up tonight. Instead they totally phoned it in, and that's what truly frustrates/depresses me."
losangeleskings,30vvuf,_Taengoo_,4,Tue Mar 31 03:42:03 2015 UTC,Hey don't forget Vancouver ;) Yea it's just been laughable lately.
losangeleskings,30vvuf,snutssss,-20,Tue Mar 31 03:21:34 2015 UTC,With solid fans like you how can they not win?

Fuck RR, Richards, and even Shore for not fucking doing anything ever except kicking a puck in last week. I'm usually pretty patient (you have to be as a kings fan), but I'm tired of watching goals on every one of their shifts."
losangeleskings,30vvuf,Shinobi801,5,Tue Mar 31 03:22:18 2015 UTC,"It's not just them that are the problem, the team in front of Quick kept hanging him out to dry.  The Blackhawks made 5v5 look like their PP."
losangeleskings,30vvuf,Enthusiasm-Curbed,3,Tue Mar 31 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, we had way too much trouble clearing the puck out of our zone. The Hawk's forecheck and their puck movement allowed them to keep getting shots left and right on us and Doughty looked like he just could not keep up. Very disappointing performance, we looked like we got way too comfortable with the fire lit under ass."
losangeleskings,30vvuf,leftylogan,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:30:46 2015 UTC,And on every goal Chicago had someone in front of Quick. Usually the defense doesn't let that happen and Quick can see the shots coming in. It was rough to watch. I just wished they would play their style of game and be consistent with it.

losangeleskings,30vaas,BiohazardPixie,3,Tue Mar 31 01:45:39 2015 UTC,Because he is the only guy on our entire roster capable of playing all 5 positions on the ice at one time. Defensive pair? Richards. Center and both wingers? Just Richards.

losangeleskings,30umow,surferboy736,4,Mon Mar 30 21:09:54 2015 UTC,He has to be. Seems like he's more or less a lock to be Stoll's permanent replacement after this season. Took him a while to adjust but I'm liking Shore's play more recently.
losangeleskings,30umow,Zanchbot,5,Mon Mar 30 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah agreed. He's had so many close chances for goals, lol. I think at some point he'll get on a hot streak and start to rack up some points, its bound to happen. Outside of that he seems to do everything well. He's good defensively, he creates turnovers, good with possesion, and as the article talks about-he's good in the faceoff circle."

I think my (and many others') frustrations come from the fact that it has been hugely heavy-handed lately, not to mention that all anyone can seem to do is insult the loyalty of our fanbase. It's also very one-sided. It's ""all in good fun"" when other teams are needling us, but Kings fans aren't able to retort in kind without typically getting downvoted pretty hard.  I acknowledge that people don't like us because we've had success lately, but I still feel that many of them have behaved very childishly this season. I hope you can understand where we're coming from."

losangeleskings,30nwz9,Pikachu1989,3,Sun Mar 29 02:54:24 2015 UTC,:( Guess I can watch Kings games again now. The winning streak ended.  Hope the Black Caps can avenge us in the Cricket World Cup tonight.
losangeleskings,30mqo3,CrispyLardon,9,Sat Mar 28 20:19:16 2015 UTC,he has the funniest quotes of any coach in sports IMO
losangeleskings,30mqo3,nenright,3,Sat Mar 28 20:24:25 2015 UTC,Definitely the funniest I've seen.
losangeleskings,30mqo3,KingsfanMDJ,8,Sat Mar 28 20:28:47 2015 UTC,uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.... yep - Darryl Sutter
losangeleskings,30mqo3,whatIsaRedditt,3,Sat Mar 28 22:00:51 2015 UTC,He makes me so happy.
losangeleskings,30mqo3,the_strat,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"For one thing, we are taking far fewer stupid penalties. Id still give credit to Sutter for that though too."
losangeleskings,30mqo3,KobeBasedGod24,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:45:12 2015 UTC,It's because Stoll isn't on the ice to take those dumb penalties.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Sniffman,11,Sun Mar 29 00:19:05 2015 UTC,You can't play like shit against a good team and expect to win. Gotta be better than this.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Sporxx,3,Sun Mar 29 00:32:34 2015 UTC,"The only part I hate about Wilds success is that my friend has been both a sore loser and a sore winner. Since that run between the Avs and Wild last year. Every time they lose it is because of a bad call, because the Wild were robbed or because one guy is out. Now when they win unless it is a shut out I tend to hear about how it should have been even more of a goal differential but  someone totally illegally checked Spurgeon and that ruined all of the things.  Sorry for the unrelated rant, unexpecting friend.  But I swear to god, even if we lose because we're  dragging our feet I just want someone to score once or twice. Jesus is waiting."
losangeleskings,30nhxw,BiohazardPixie,2,Sun Mar 29 00:40:04 2015 UTC,I promise you we are not all like your friend.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Greek___Geek,8,Sun Mar 29 02:50:23 2015 UTC,/u/Ghost00 where you at
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Ghost00,8,Sun Mar 29 00:19:39 2015 UTC,Oh shit. I'm sorry. I'm at wedding right now and totally blanked out. Sorry!
losangeleskings,30nhxw,CrispyLardon,4,Sun Mar 29 00:23:24 2015 UTC,How dare you have a life outside of us.

losangeleskings,30nhxw,lordjedediah,7,Sun Mar 29 00:59:40 2015 UTC,That was some shitty officiating.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,CrispyLardon,2,Sun Mar 29 01:21:26 2015 UTC,I'm speechless.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Trevoc555,6,Sun Mar 29 01:21:55 2015 UTC,"Little do they know is when the Kings are down 2-0 is when they are at their strongest, muhahaha.  Seriously though this is bad play. Gotta step it up big time if we want to see any iota of success this game."
losangeleskings,30nhxw,lordjedediah,6,Sun Mar 29 00:45:11 2015 UTC,"Nolan didnt even look like he wanted to fight. Good job taking Stewart off the ice, though"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,CrispyLardon,5,Sun Mar 29 01:22:14 2015 UTC,"He didn't. I can't believe it even escalated to a fight. Muzzin got sucker punched twice, Nolan fires back and then seemed to be done with the situation. Stewart should've ended up with a roughing penalty as well as the major."
losangeleskings,30nhxw,t3rneado,5,Sun Mar 29 01:26:13 2015 UTC,Great effort Top Titty--keep it up.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,t3rneado,3,Sun Mar 29 01:26:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, are we allowed friendly banter in here?"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,BiohazardPixie,7,Sun Mar 29 00:27:23 2015 UTC,Banter is always allowed
losangeleskings,30nhxw,t3rneado,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:29:26 2015 UTC,What a goal! -Flames Fan!
losangeleskings,30nhxw,BiohazardPixie,3,Sun Mar 29 00:32:09 2015 UTC,But... but you were traded to us Q_Q
losangeleskings,30nhxw,t3rneado,2,Sun Mar 29 00:50:35 2015 UTC,"hah I know, but Lets be honest, my true loyalties lie with Flames. I was hoping to be traded to an east team! so I could get invested.. but our biggest rival right now..  Why me!"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,redwoodclimber,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:55:40 2015 UTC,"Sooo if we were Columbus you would be Jeff Carter. My heart, it hurts!"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,t3rneado,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:07:20 2015 UTC,? I don't get it?
losangeleskings,30nhxw,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:10:00 2015 UTC,"Carts used to play for Columbus and never really produced for them/""was toxic"". Once he left he became the man we all know and love. Columbus is still salty. Oddly, the same thing could be said for Gabo."
losangeleskings,30nhxw,wizardmami,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yea I chose Regehr for my Flair because I grew up across the street from him, I knew him decently well on a more personal level, I shoveled his walks all winter, I was paid by Robyn Regehr! I also got tickets to games and signed jerseys from him! Of course I was sad when he was traded but then he won the cup with you guys! So I was really happy about that. I remember how bummed he was when we lost to Tampa in '04."
losangeleskings,30nhxw,derpina77,6,Sun Mar 29 18:21:23 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm going to be extremely frustrated by this game.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,derpina77,7,Sun Mar 29 00:29:33 2015 UTC,Fuuuuuuck
losangeleskings,30nhxw,virtualmayhem,4,Sun Mar 29 00:31:45 2015 UTC,Can we not.....
losangeleskings,30nhxw,derpina77,5,Sun Mar 29 00:33:39 2015 UTC,Terrible period. I hope Sutter gets the team going by telling them how awful they were
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Rando_Thoughtful,4,Sun Mar 29 00:43:52 2015 UTC,"Jones in, Quick out.    Sutter, what are you doing"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,CaptainH00die,3,Sun Mar 29 01:01:02 2015 UTC,Odd and not Sutter-like. Maybe it was Quicks idea?
losangeleskings,30nhxw,kaosChild,3,Sun Mar 29 01:04:28 2015 UTC,"He's done it in the past, Sutter has pulled quick saying: they need to play well enough on defense to deserve him"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,th3byrdm4n,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:12:09 2015 UTC,He may have done that yea but it rarely happens. Especially after the first period and just 2 goals. Sutter is notorious for trusting the players to turn the game around on their own.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,DustinBrownsKnee,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:22:58 2015 UTC,It could also be that Jones needs to be prepared for being dropped into high-tension high-priority situations going into the playoffs.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Ghost00,2,Sun Mar 29 01:38:50 2015 UTC,I think he wanted to make the skaters work harder.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,RubeusShagrid,3,Sun Mar 29 01:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hes done it a few times times year. They cant rely on Quick every night"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Ghost00,2,Sun Mar 29 01:16:31 2015 UTC,I wasn't watching.  As a Quick fantasy owner need I be worried?
losangeleskings,30nhxw,RubeusShagrid,2,Sun Mar 29 01:25:22 2015 UTC,No. Sutter pulled him because he thinks the team would get more focused if the back-up was in the net
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Ghost00,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely making a statement. Quick was going to have to stand on his head tonight to be competitive the way the Kings were playing, no point burning him out 0-2 with a team that won't compete."
losangeleskings,30nhxw,CaptainH00die,3,Sun Mar 29 01:28:43 2015 UTC,Your thread is fine. He'd probably in traffic or at dinner or something of that nature.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,madmusic420,4,Sun Mar 29 00:22:01 2015 UTC,At a wedding.... Totally blanked out
losangeleskings,30nhxw,CaptainH00die,2,Sun Mar 29 00:23:52 2015 UTC,How are the bridesmaids lookin?
losangeleskings,30nhxw,clickersunite,5,Sun Mar 29 00:51:33 2015 UTC,There's only one..... And it's a no
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Ghost00,2,Sun Mar 29 00:54:18 2015 UTC,Bride took every precaution of not having the bridesmaids show her up or what?
losangeleskings,30nhxw,RubeusShagrid,3,Sun Mar 29 01:03:03 2015 UTC,No. Less stress for her
losangeleskings,30nhxw,RubeusShagrid,3,Sun Mar 29 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"C'mon boys, don't let up just yet."
losangeleskings,30nhxw,RubeusShagrid,3,Sun Mar 29 00:25:50 2015 UTC,We need to get some possession going. Minnesota looks great!Fuck

losangeleskings,30nhxw,nenright,3,Sun Mar 29 00:32:56 2015 UTC,Can someone do post game? Thanks
losangeleskings,30nhxw,CrispyLardon,2,Sun Mar 29 01:00:04 2015 UTC,"Im drunk, but i'll try. Enjoy the wedding"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,wizardmami,2,Sun Mar 29 01:02:56 2015 UTC,haha I can do it if you're inebriated
losangeleskings,30nhxw,CaptainH00die,2,Sun Mar 29 01:05:00 2015 UTC,"Go ahead, it'll be 5 am here when this game is done, so it would be a mess"

losangeleskings,30nhxw,clickersunite,2,Sun Mar 29 01:09:30 2015 UTC,Winland. The greatest hockey country in Europe
losangeleskings,30nhxw,CaptainH00die,2,Sun Mar 29 01:14:15 2015 UTC,I'm ashamed to say that I actually googled Winland...
losangeleskings,30nhxw,BiohazardPixie,2,Sun Mar 29 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you should be haha"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,virtualmayhem,3,Sun Mar 29 01:20:14 2015 UTC,5 on 3 come on
losangeleskings,30nhxw,RubeusShagrid,3,Sun Mar 29 01:36:09 2015 UTC,Calling it now. Carter with an early one to tie it up.

losangeleskings,30nhxw,CaptainH00die,5,Sun Mar 29 02:29:17 2015 UTC,One of those games then

losangeleskings,30nhxw,CaptainH00die,2,Sun Mar 29 01:07:26 2015 UTC,King of Kings. Who else
losangeleskings,30nhxw,HadADat,2,Sun Mar 29 01:07:47 2015 UTC,So I had closed the game [internet went out] and while my router was rebooting King scored...
losangeleskings,30nhxw,m3thodm4n021,2,Sun Mar 29 01:10:46 2015 UTC,Go King(s)!!
losangeleskings,30nhxw,weirdalec222,2,Sun Mar 29 01:11:05 2015 UTC,What exactly did Nolan do?
losangeleskings,30nhxw,OverlordKopi_2037,2,Sun Mar 29 01:23:25 2015 UTC,Pushed a guy who shoved his teammate then got caught by the arm until he agreed to drop the gloves. Got punched a lot until the referees did a thing...  Just Nolan things?
losangeleskings,30nhxw,RubeusShagrid,2,Sun Mar 29 01:31:33 2015 UTC,P-p-p-powerplay!

losangeleskings,30nhxw,RubeusShagrid,2,Sun Mar 29 01:35:44 2015 UTC,Come on lads! Get another one!
losangeleskings,30nhxw,RubeusShagrid,2,Sun Mar 29 01:35:58 2015 UTC,FIVE ON THREE COME ON BOYS.  ALSO YOU MOTHERFUCKERS NEED TO TALK I FEEL LIKE I'M ALONE IN HERE.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Sporxx,2,Sun Mar 29 01:36:52 2015 UTC,HOW'S THIS?
losangeleskings,30nhxw,chrissytheblack,3,Sun Mar 29 01:38:41 2015 UTC,A LITTLE BETTER THANKS.  FUCK THAT STICK SAVE
losangeleskings,30nhxw,_Taengoo_,2,Sun Mar 29 01:39:12 2015 UTC,The Wild Dman just made the save of the game.  Edit: Brodin. Play of the game.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,chrissytheblack,2,Sun Mar 29 01:37:07 2015 UTC,That period was a lot better
losangeleskings,30nhxw,deadly_creampuff,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:39:35 2015 UTC,If they can keep it up or even step it up a bit more going into the thirddddd. Let's go boys o/
losangeleskings,30nhxw,DoktorJeep,2,Sun Mar 29 01:40:37 2015 UTC,I feel good going into the third. Capitalize early and I think the game is ours.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,DoktorJeep,2,Sun Mar 29 01:40:38 2015 UTC,"25 shots. It's Devan Dubnyk, not Hasek"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,BlueMoonFC,2,Sun Mar 29 02:01:52 2015 UTC,This game reminds me of the Isles game. Hopefully we get a similar result. I'd be happy with even just getting 1 point tonight.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,BiohazardPixie,2,Sun Mar 29 02:03:41 2015 UTC,"McNabb just killed a man.    Put a shoulder through his chest, tried to deke him, now youre dead.    I wish Sutter plays him in the future"

losangeleskings,30nhxw,Ghost00,2,Sun Mar 29 02:29:35 2015 UTC,Damn toffoli getting unlucky with the timing on his penalties
losangeleskings,30nhxw,GRiZZY19,2,Sun Mar 29 02:30:16 2015 UTC,"Kings playing like the Kings today, which...is not good"
losangeleskings,30nhxw,Ghost00,4,Sun Mar 29 00:25:51 2015 UTC,Got a feeling this will be our 'throwaway' game.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,GRiZZY19,3,Sun Mar 29 00:28:20 2015 UTC,These stupid ass chants after every save are getting old.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,dedknedy,3,Sun Mar 29 00:36:30 2015 UTC,"Then we gotta score! It is the only way to take away its power. The team is on a killer run, they are praising the guy, I don't like it, but I get why they do it. Somebody has to stop it, hopefully we can!"

losangeleskings,30nhxw,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:29:12 2015 UTC,Apparently we had daylight savings 6 minutes ago. It's 5 am already
losangeleskings,30nhxw,sleepingwithj,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:06:49 2015 UTC,Good job to Richards hustling to draw that penalty.
losangeleskings,30nhxw,BiohazardPixie,2,Sun Mar 29 02:09:06 2015 UTC,Im glad he got recalled. Hes a lot better than Andreoff and Stoll

losangeleskings,30nwrr,simplejack66,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:36:37 2015 UTC,Toffoli had an all around horrible night really. But so did the rest of the team I suppose.
losangeleskings,30n52e,nessman930,12,Sat Mar 28 22:27:51 2015 UTC,I'm holding off until we make the playoffs. Until then I'll keep my cool and just watch our boys continue to roll.

losangeleskings,30n52e,DustinBrownsKnee,3,Sun Mar 29 00:12:26 2015 UTC,"Do some thing similar to what /u/godfarber did on /r/hockey to address all the hate towards the Panthers for our attendance records, it really changed most of the comments about panthers from other fans from relocation to our playoff race, I don't see how it can't work here."
losangeleskings,30n52e,Papichulo666,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"I've thought about posting something like that, but I figured it'd probably just get downvoted."

losangeleskings,30kehs,Nougatizer,16,Sat Mar 28 04:32:25 2015 UTC,I'm not going anywhere!
losangeleskings,30kehs,zeussays,36,Sat Mar 28 06:37:25 2015 UTC,I see the downvotes as marks of respect and fear other teams have of us right now. We don't play their east coast game and we win which pisses them off. R/hockey hates us because they ain't us.
losangeleskings,30kehs,flybyknight,19,Sat Mar 28 04:25:59 2015 UTC,"Fear? Definitely. Respect? They might respect the team, but to say that we as fans get respect from them is pretty laughable in my opinion."
losangeleskings,30kehs,GaboKopiBrown,13,Sat Mar 28 04:50:01 2015 UTC,I doubt most of them respect the team. Too much talk about dirty play and puck luck.
losangeleskings,30kehs,krucz36,11,Sat Mar 28 05:15:12 2015 UTC,also bought and paid for refs.
losangeleskings,30kehs,zeussays,3,Sat Mar 28 06:57:13 2015 UTC,"I said I see it that way. It's just, like, my opinion, man."
losangeleskings,30kehs,flybyknight,2,Sat Mar 28 05:01:26 2015 UTC,True enough. The dude abides.
losangeleskings,30kehs,Shadax,6,Sat Mar 28 05:16:01 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with that. It's a stupid way to do it, though heh."
losangeleskings,30kehs,n0wl,2,Sat Mar 28 06:38:09 2015 UTC,They hate us because they anus?
losangeleskings,30kehs,RubeusShagrid,16,Sat Mar 28 21:27:22 2015 UTC,I love my Lumbus bros. I dont know why they've turned their backs on us. :( I still <3 them.
losangeleskings,30kehs,CrispyLardon,6,Sat Mar 28 04:32:59 2015 UTC,"It's the Jeff Carter thing. Which isn't anyone's fault but his. I still hate what he did to us, but it's not worth hating the rest of the Kings over."
losangeleskings,30kehs,CrispyLardon,4,Sat Mar 28 06:39:02 2015 UTC,"I think Carter gets a bad rap. He signed a huge contract extension with the Flyers (including a no trade clause) and they dealt him away before it took effect. His numbers weren't bad in Columbus. Happy or not, he seemed to be putting in the work."
losangeleskings,30kehs,dwight_spitz,4,Sat Mar 28 15:41:28 2015 UTC,"That was shitty on Phili's part, but he was a locker room toxin as well outside of numbers and that's not fair to the team."
losangeleskings,30kehs,BadAtThisKindOfThing,4,Sat Mar 28 16:39:13 2015 UTC,Probably something the GM at CBJ should have considered. It's something Lombardi seems to do.
losangeleskings,30kehs,krucz36,2,Sat Mar 28 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"Probably. I don't disagree with you that management fucked up, but Carter is a professional. He had a right to be upset, but no right to be such a toxin."
losangeleskings,30kehs,cantremembr,3,Sat Mar 28 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"The bit about being a professional always comes up. It's patronizing, I admit, but I don't expect much emotional maturity from someone under thirty that plays a game for a living. I can't even imagine how their parents prepared them for that life."

When I finally made an account after lurking /r/hockey and /r/losangeleskings for a bit of time, I've been trying to improve our fanbase's reputation on the board.  I try to stay positive, not get salty about things and I have not downvoted anyone (I feel that if you don't like something, you can ignore it) but I admit it gets tiring.    Day after day of what seems to be the majority of hockey fans judging you and generalizing you and the team, for the flair you're wearing is upsetting.  I've only been here for a couple of months but I can see why some of the more veteran members are bitter towards /r/hockey.    But I'm glad that /u/daft_funk87 and others have organized this RUL draft.  I would like to think that it will broaden everyone's perspective like it did yours and maybe /r/hockey can be a better community from it."

I understand the Kings are a huge threat to any team that faces them in the playoffs so seeing all 29 teams (fans at least) want us out of the playoffs makes me feel all giddy inside. My thoughts are as long as the banter is in good spirits everything is fine and great for any sport.

Far as I can see, we are exactly where we were last night, still one point ahead. We lose tomorrow, we gain no ground. And we are up against an incredibly tough team with one of the best records over the last 30 games. Then we play the Hawks who are never never easy, let alone when playing in united center. We still have to face Calgary and San Jose before the end. Nothing is ever in the bag, not this tight of a race. This is factoring in our atrocious road play this year and the fact that Calgary has been a comeback team for a long time. There's still a very, very good chance we don't make playoffs. As much as I want to celebrate at how good we've been playing, it ain't gonna mean shit if we don't win the majority of our next 8 games. every single game is an elimination game now, and let's just hope our proficiency in that particular area carries over from last year."

In a game that goes to overtime, 2 points are awarded to the team who wins in OT or by shootout, but the losing team gets 1 point as an atta-boy for putting forth a decent effort for 60 minutes of regulation. So there you go, 3 total points in the standings are awarded for games going to OT.  So how does this play out on April 11? Instead of Calgary and Jets beating the snot out of each other for a regulation win, they agree that ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"", collude to keep the Kings out of the playoffs (because of Operation Regicide and being the most currently despised/dangerous team in the NHL), and ensures that 2 points and 1 point will be awarded specifically (depending on the standings) to keep the Kings out of the playoffs.

losangeleskings,30jfhu,Destillat,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:39:35 2015 UTC,what kinda dark rum?
losangeleskings,30jfhu,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:47:18 2015 UTC,Sailor Jerry's is my simple choice but I enjoy everything. Not a big fan of Capt. and Bacardi though.   At this bar it's happy hour so Meyers
losangeleskings,30jfhu,Destillat,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:03:25 2015 UTC,Captain and sailors are ok. Spiced rum is good mixed with coke but not much else.   Bacardi has a few decent rums like try the Bacardi 8. Staples Center has it.   I liked nice aged rums like Zaya 12 year or Ron Zacapa 23. For Dark rums I like Goslings black seal.   Have you been to the rum bar near staples?
losangeleskings,30jfhu,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:08:14 2015 UTC,I am honestly way less versed in the world of rums than I realized. I've been meanign to get to bevmo and check out something in their rum selection that isn't your run of the mill cheap rum.  I didn't even know we had a rum bar around Staples; I work in Orange County so most game days I'm driving up and pre-gaming out of my trunk before rushing in to my seat. I'll have to take some time out to locate this next time I'm up there. Thanks for the tip!
losangeleskings,30jfhu,Destillat,1 point,Sat Mar 28 09:48:17 2015 UTC,The rum bar is called caña. It doesn't open until 8pm so you gotta go after games. They don't care about jerseys but don't allow hats. The other thing is it's a membership club (due to some stupid zoning law I guess). But it's $20 a year and you can take a few guests with you. But the rum menu is a huge multiple page list.
losangeleskings,30jfhu,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:01:59 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh ok now that you're mentioning it, I do remember hearing about this place.

If you've ever had mint chocolate chip ice cream, it's kind of like that, but without the chocolate chips.

losangeleskings,30iw0d,QuickerThanFasth,9,Fri Mar 27 19:25:50 2015 UTC,circle the game against the flames. that game will probably end up being the most important game of the season.
losangeleskings,30iw0d,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:13:30 2015 UTC,We also play against the Canucks too.
losangeleskings,30iw0d,RubyRhod,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:33:20 2015 UTC,yeah but thats less important. getting above the canucks would be great. but we gotta get in first. unless canucks have a losing streak they will make it no matter what. its really us vs calgary
losangeleskings,30iw0d,thegetawayplan9,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:36:08 2015 UTC,The Canucks are only 2 points ahead of us and we play them once. We could easily slip into 2nd place just as easily as we can miss the playoffs.
losangeleskings,30iw0d,RubyRhod,2,Sat Mar 28 00:48:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We're not talking about the Ducks here, the Canucks occupy a spot that is within striking distance. We need to worry about teams closely ahead of us and closely behind us.   Canucks, Flames, Wild, and Jets all need to lose. Obviously for tonights game we want the Wild to win in regulation."

losangeleskings,30k09a,JeromeW,3,Sat Mar 28 01:02:06 2015 UTC,Stubhub.com   Aside from getting lucky that's where you'll find the widest range of tickets and the prices fluctuate from day to day. Id expect they are unlikely to drop much since they're on a roll and every game is huge. Only a few home games left. Good luck!

losangeleskings,30k09a,toolazytodie,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:38:50 2015 UTC,Don't they add 12%?
losangeleskings,30k09a,toolazytodie,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:42:37 2015 UTC,"Not when I dealt with them. All they charge is the ticket price and usually a few fees. I was able to get good seats previously in the season for a good price. (Thank you BasedFinAid!). I just checked and the prices seem to be above average, probably because of the playoff push. But like I said, they're pretty good to buy from. Currently the lowest on Stubhub for 300's(for two tix) is $74 each, but on VividSeats it's $59 each. I just added tickets to my cart on both, and the price comes to $148 for stubhub and $152 for Vividseats. The tix on Stubhub would be Row 12 in 319, while VS would be Row 5 in 309. Either way they're about the same. It's all who you prefer to deal with"

losangeleskings,30gvoi,t3rneado,3,Fri Mar 27 07:04:05 2015 UTC,"I like the service of hockeystreams, but I almost regret buying it now that ragecenter is a thing."
losangeleskings,30gvoi,RubyRhod,2,Fri Mar 27 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"I like Hockeystreams better still. They have the minor league teams, so I can check out our farms, and HS has been around longer so you can go pretty far back in the calendar to watch replays of games. Makes it very easy to gif games where you think to yourself ""Oh man I want to see that again later"" but don't remember until 2 years after you've won the cup.  I will say it's easier to jump around in ragecenter than hockeystreams."
losangeleskings,30gvoi,Destillat,2,Fri Mar 27 18:24:39 2015 UTC,Isn't ragecenter free though?
losangeleskings,30gvoi,RubyRhod,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:54:08 2015 UTC,"....yes  I guess as far as just watching the games is concerned, RC is the better option because it's free. Although the original post by /u/NHLRageCenter did say ""free for now"""

losangeleskings,30gvoi,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,2,Fri Mar 27 08:49:37 2015 UTC,Is RageCenter like hockeystreams? What are the differences if you don't mind me asking.
losangeleskings,30gvoi,Destillat,1 point,Fri Mar 27 13:33:23 2015 UTC,"RageCenter as I understand it is a web stream of those VLC streams that used to be in every GDT (and still are sometimes maybe, I haven't really been looking for them). You're presented with a youtube like interface and some quality options, as well as options for the two teams' feeds.  I don't know how Hockeystreams works, but you have something very similar, quality options, home and away feeds (or all three feeds if there's also a national broadcast) but the benefit of Hockeystreams imo is that you can go further back in the calendar for game replays and can watch games from different leagues (OHL, AHL, ECHL, etc) provided they have a video feed of the game.  The main difference between the two of course is price. HS is about 100 a (calendar) year, RageCenter is free. HS has run a playoff special for the last two years where you get the remainder of the regular season and playoffs for 33 bucks.   If you want an invite to try RC, let me know."
losangeleskings,30gvoi,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,2,Fri Mar 27 16:09:29 2015 UTC,That would be awesome if you don't mind. And thanks for the information!

losangeleskings,30fzng,flybyknight,25,Fri Mar 27 01:43:40 2015 UTC,"How goddamn money has sekera been for us since we got him? Can we all take a minute to appreciate just how good Sekera has been for us? Seems like every shift he's on the ice he's doing good stuff, holding the puck in the O-zone, taking a shot right on net, transitioning easily and efficiently. He's been really good for us, especially the last 3-4 games. Kopi gonna Kop. When Kopi is hot, things are usually fun, goddamn do I love Anze. That last minute and a half took about 5 years off my life, our cursed bitter rival empty net strikes again. We'll get him someday. We cling to our precious long shot of a post season for one more night. Still have a really tough road ahead. We pretty much have to be perfect, I don't see Calgary losing too many games from here on out. If the Habs could help us out that would be nice, but it doesn't seem like they want to. :\"

losangeleskings,30fabf,SorryNoSorry,2,Fri Mar 27 00:26:30 2015 UTC,Can't Doughty just tell Sutter he needs a break rather than hurting us with these penalties?
losangeleskings,30fabf,SorryNoSorry,2,Fri Mar 27 00:29:51 2015 UTC,that penalty has nothing to do with being tired. its because tavares took his stick away from him and chucked it
losangeleskings,30fabf,nenright,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:31:57 2015 UTC,"Doughty had all the time in the world to either hand pass that or clear the zone via hand pass. Like the guy said in the epix special, doughty is not a smart man"
losangeleskings,30fabf,kingsnwings,2,Fri Mar 27 00:34:09 2015 UTC,"im sure he could have, but had the ref done his fucking job, we would've had a power play by the time that could have happened anyway. And either way, that penalty isnt a result of fatigue, its a result of tavares' holding the stick not being called and doughty being angry"
losangeleskings,30fabf,nenright,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:39:18 2015 UTC,That penalty was 100% doughtys fault. Yes tavares did what he did. But that doesnt force doughty to go full retard

losangeleskings,30dqji,NYCalifornian,26,Thu Mar 26 15:32:32 2015 UTC,The fact that they're 0-5 in their last 5 home games is actually worrying. That dam has to break eventually and you know the Isles are going to be fighting for it.
losangeleskings,30dqji,Zanchbot,2,Thu Mar 26 16:46:54 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. Not to be negative but the last game I went to we lost. It was against the Flyers on a losing streak while we were on a win streak.
losangeleskings,30dqji,smashblu,5,Thu Mar 26 17:47:30 2015 UTC,The Islanders are just too good this year for a losing streak like that to go on for much longer. Though I've heard Halak has been regressing to his career averages lately which probably doesn't help.
losangeleskings,30dqji,Zanchbot,2,Thu Mar 26 18:02:56 2015 UTC,The Flyers are really good at that though. They shock ya. It's sometimes the only thing that makes it worth being a fan.
losangeleskings,30dqji,ScarletWitch65,2,Thu Mar 26 18:42:47 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Next 3 games are against strong possession playoff teams in their home buildings. Time to prove we deserve that spot.

Please bow your head and recite the following and be baptized into a new fandom:   We believe in Martinez, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth; and in Raccoon Jesus, Our Lord, Who was conceived in Jesenice, Slovenia, Drafted by Dave Taylor, Suffered under Crawford and Murray, But in 2012, ascended into eternal glory. He now sits at the right hand of Martinez; From there He shall come to lead His fans and disciples once more. We believe in Holy Toffoli, The system of Darryl Sutter, The communion of Kings players, past and present, The forgiveness of Muzzin, And the return of the Cup to Los Angeles once more. Amen.   Now, as a newly christened Kings fan, you must prepare to accept the following:   If there is an inopportune time to take an offensive zone penalty, Stoll will take it.  If a defensive breakdown leads to a goal, Jake #HotMuzz Muzzin will take all the blame regardless of his all-powerful eyebrows It is a known fact that Dwight King takes pleasure in devouring souls.  Quick has a sassy attitude and you must now love and accept it.  Drew Doughty hates loves Trevor Lewis No one can stop Jeff Carter or his good looks Justin Williams nickname is Stick Holy Toffoli That 70s Line - Pearson / Carter / Toffoli That 70s Line Part Deux - King / Carter / Toffoli Top Line Trevor Lewis is an American Hero and is actually having a great year even though his hands are made of stone.

losangeleskings,30cba5,LOUD__NOISES,12,Thu Mar 26 16:59:36 2015 UTC,"Welcome!!!  Little history:   Kings were founded in the NHL Expansion. First season was 1967. First major sustained success was in the late 1970s with the ""Triple Crown Line"" (Dionne, Simmer, Taylor). Acquired Gretzky in 1988. Playoff contenders almost overnight.  Reached the finals in 1993, lost to MTL. Got back into playoff contention again in 1999. Made a solid playoff run in 2000-2001. Won against DET, lost to COL. Slumped again in the mid 00's. Rebuilt. Drafted well. And here we are.   Players:   Gaborik and Kopitar (A) anchor the top line. You should know that Kopitar is kind of a big deal. Second line is ""That 70s Line"" (Pearson/King - Carter - Tofolli). They get really hot every so often and can match up with a lot of first lines when they do. Pearson is currently injured. Carter has really matured as an all-around player, and Titty and Pearson are our next generation of scorers (both are 22). 3rd line usually sees some sort of combination of Williams, Brown (C), King, Lewis. Stoll usually centers (injured). Lewis is an American HeroTM 4th line is usually Nolan - Shore - Clifford. Clifford is a fan favorite. Nolan is a fan unfavorite. Both are really good for young 4th line grinders. Shore hasn't scored an NHL goal yet. Richards is currently centering this line after coming back from the AHL. I love Richards. You love Richards. You already love Dewey, so I don't need to convince you that he's the best Dman in the NHL. Goofball off the ice. BFFs with American Hero Trevor Lewis. Muzzin is a good defenseman according to analytics, but he makes some dumb fucking plays sometimes. Alec Martinez is jazz hands. Andrej Sekera is new. He's adapted really well. Regehr and Greene (A) are old men. Greene is a solid locker room leader. We played a lot of our season with McBain and McNabb, the former being the cheapest defenseman we could get and the latter being young and not 100% ready for the NHL. Both have improved as the year has passed.  Quick is a god. /r/hockey loves the ""not elite"" agenda, but he makes some pretty great saves and has kept us in a lot of games. We come back to win this one. His ""slump"" this year was mostly due to shitty defense. I'm not sure if our backup goalie Martin ""Indiana""  Jones is on the team anymore. He hasn't played that much...   Management & other personnel:   I'm sure you are familiar with our our coach. Darryl Sutter's comical responses to the media are always great. He definitely operates on a different level in the locker room though; we saw that in the Epix Series. Dean Lombardi is our GM. He's made some great trades at the deadline (Carter & Gaborik .... sorry) that's proved to secure the Cup. He's managed the team extremely well. Luc Robitaille serves as the President of Business Operations.  If you can, listen to our FS-W broadcast team. Bob Miller, our play by play, is a Hall of Famer for broadcasting. One of the best. Jim Fox, our color commentator, knows the team and the game extremely well (played his entire career in LA). One of the higher hockey IQs for color guys, IMO.    Retired Numbers:   4 Rob Blake (2015) 16 Marcel Dionne (1990) 18 Dave Taylor (1995) 20 Luc Robitaille (2007) 30 Rogie Vachon  (1985) 99 The Great One (2002)   If that wasn't enough, here's some vids:  Dewey Show (you'll like this, and it gives an oddly good feel for players)   2012 Cup Run (I think it's the best Kings vid. Really well done.)  2014 Cup Run  I'm sure someone will post the prayer book, so enjoy that. Haha"

losangeleskings,30cba5,krucz36,4,Thu Mar 26 06:16:10 2015 UTC,"Being a Kings fan has been really rewarding. Just going off my memory which probably only remembers the important stuff, the earliest I remember watching the Kings was a playoff game during the 93 run (6 years old at the time, don't remember much anyways).   Since then the Kings had been pretty awful. Like hilariously really bad awful. My father moved to California in 68 and has been going since their second season, and we casually refer to the Kings as the Stins. I dunno why Stins, maybe because they stank but whatever. The Kings had some good drafting, a ridiculous court jester uniform in 96 or so, and got into the playoffs for a few years in the late 90s and early 2000s. I remember the Kings being the #1 team in the west l, then Adam Deadmarsh got a nasty concussion and was forced to retire, and the kings ended up missing the playoffs even though they were at the top in December.  I kinda mark this as the moment the Kings started completely sucking until '09-10  During this shit period it seemed the Kings were making some decent trades and drafting, but you know it takes a while. Andy Murray was coaching and I got to see him throw a chair on the ice, that was probably the best part of his coaching, pretty awful otherwise.  Crawford was signed as the next coach but he didn't do much except have some kind of love affair for Dan Cloutier, who sucked. 3GA was a good game for him, and he was Crawfords boy so that sucked.  They didn't have a great goalie for a while. Potvin was probably one of the better ones, but we seemed to go through them quickly. Garon, LaBarbara, Chechmanek (barf), for a while I was convinced Erik Ersberg was going to be the starter. Thank god for Quick.  Anyways so we finally hired Terry Murry and he helped get the team playing defensively and responsibly. I don't think the Kings took advantage if the '05 lockout like how the Ducks did, they were able get Scott Niedermeyer, get rid of some contracts. I don't remember the Kings doing anything good.   Best thing that would have happened to the Kings in '07 was the Ducks winning, I think it forced the Kings management to realize the Ducks aren't that far down the freeway and fans just want to see a cup after 40 years. I think it kicked the Kings into gear and got them on track for building a competitive team and not being satisfied with being mediocre.  I got my drivers license in '06 and started going to Kings games every few weeks. I mean you could get tickets in the Die Hard Fan section on a bad day for $12, it was great. I hardly remember them ever winning a game when I went (sorry guys, bad luck here!) but dang it was fun and cheap. The Kings picked up some good players, I think Handzus and Stuart were two of the better FAs (let's pretend Nagy didn't happen), the Kings broke my heart and traded my longtime favorite Lubo to the oilers but got Greene and Stoll. The team was starting to look good, also had: Simmonds, Kopi, MFJJ, Richardson, Quincy, Frolov, Smyth, Parse (forever hip injured), Schenn, Scuderi...  FINALLY the Kings made it to the playoffs and I got to see the glorious game 4 loss (sorry guys, probably my fault again), thought we were going to go up 3-1 but ya know. Then 2011 rolled around and FUCK the sharks. Seriously I never got the ducks/kings rivalry, it was always more heated against the stars and sharks. So the sharks broke my heart but at least the Kings were making the playoffs again.  Then from 2012 onward has been a real treat. Like seriously after my whole life of bad hockey, this has been so special. I feel spoiled, I'm finally started to get used to the team winning and not feel surprised. Even if the Kings never made the playoffs again, I'll be satisfied. Disappointed, but satisfied with the two Stanley Cups. I just can't believe my dad has to wait an extra 25 years longer than I did, and he jumped ship to see a cup in person in '07, I'm sorry he gave up after 40 years (also fuck him for that). Someone else here probably can tell you the pre-90s history a lot better since I didn't watch before then, but that's all that sticks out in my mind since then."

losangeleskings,30df4q,kangpeh1,8,Thu Mar 26 13:58:38 2015 UTC,"I can't even watch. My first game as a kings fan and I can't watch =(  My dad is driving across the state to help me buy a car, since this is what happened to my car two weeks ago in Columbus. I was on my way from Pittsburgh to Chicago to meet up with friends, making a pit stop in Columbus to pick up a friend and totaled my car.   I'm not sure how dad will react to ""hey, we have to watch this kings game because I was drafted by the Kings subreddit in the first round"" especially since he wants me to quit reddit and focus on school.   Never fear. I'll be around later,just after my dad leaves."
losangeleskings,30df4q,PittPensPats,3,Thu Mar 26 14:51:30 2015 UTC,if you download the kings app (on android) I know they have a free radio stream so you can at least listen!

They're an east coast team with tons of talent that we outmatched in the finals last year. I don't recall our series with them being very dirty (but I don't recall the series very well anyway due to alcohol). Their tears just... don't really hit the spot for me like some other teams' tears do. The hate feels very one-way, if there is any."
losangeleskings,30ag97,KeanuReavers,13,Wed Mar 25 21:52:43 2015 UTC,thats always the best....one team has so much hate for another and the other just doesnt even give a fuck
losangeleskings,30ag97,Helios321,13,Wed Mar 25 22:09:09 2015 UTC,The Coyotes.
losangeleskings,30ag97,CaptainH00die,7,Thu Mar 26 02:49:27 2015 UTC,Pretty much sums up our relationship with the Ducks.

losangeleskings,30ag97,ZiggyPalffyLA,6,Thu Mar 26 03:21:54 2015 UTC,Exactly. They seem to have a really obsessive hatred of us.
losangeleskings,30ag97,BagelzAllDay,2,Thu Mar 26 04:00:02 2015 UTC,"for the record, rangers fans are often incredible douchenozzles"
losangeleskings,30ag97,krucz36,2,Thu Mar 26 07:32:23 2015 UTC,Like a lot of new yorkers
losangeleskings,30ag97,nenright,7,Sat Mar 28 16:16:21 2015 UTC,"The Rangers gave the Kings a hell of a series--part of the general trend of us being insanely spoiled with phenomenal hockey during last year's playoffs. I can't hate on Hank, and in general bear no ill will towards their franchise at all.  Which didn't make last night's victory any less enjoyable!"
losangeleskings,30ag97,Pomerantz,6,Wed Mar 25 22:29:26 2015 UTC,"Hah, amen! I love Hank, especially when he's winning medals for Sweden during the olympics, but I think I love watching Kopi hand out goals to his buddies just a little bit more..."
losangeleskings,30ag97,KeanuReavers,2,Wed Mar 25 22:34:56 2015 UTC,that pass to gaborik was fucking magnificent
losangeleskings,30ag97,nenright,13,Thu Mar 26 05:31:06 2015 UTC,"I find it funny how many people get mad that we are ""overhyped"" and say we aren't as good as we look. We've won 2 cups in 3 years, obviously we have some level of skill, unless you think we've literally lucked into a stanley cup twice now. I mean, we obviously have our issues and we go on long losing streaks, but to say we aren't skilled or a good team despite all kinds of stats and evidence is just plain stupid. I hate the ducks, but I'm not to prideful that I can't say ""goddamn they have a really good team."" because it's true, they have a good team. The Kings are a good team, at its core. Even if we don't make playoffs this year that doesn't change the fact that we have a good team. To say we are overhyped and that we really suck because all our stats are bullshit and Doughty is literally not even good is just plain retarded."
losangeleskings,30ag97,ToastedFireBomb,3,Thu Mar 26 01:30:45 2015 UTC,Look at all the comments about how dirty the Kings play and how they get away with holding and interference (as if it were not part of the game for the last century) and you see that they think the refs are in the Kings pocket.  Crazy talk for sure but they want to blame someone else for their woes.
losangeleskings,30ag97,pbjamm,3,Thu Mar 26 03:53:14 2015 UTC,"It's mostly just annoying. Anyone who says any team has the refs in their pocket just sounds idiotic. I don't really think the kings play dirtier than any other team out there, we hit harder, sure, but 99% of the time I feel confident that our hits are legal and fair. And when they aren't, I will fully own up to it. Toffoli's hit the other day on Burrows? That was not clean, that was pretty dirty and I think we can all agree on that. But 9 out of 10 times I think we play pretty clean hockey. It just bugs me when people make shit up and say things like ""well obviously the Kings are just lucky, they don't have any actual skill, they are really just a bad team and the stats are all skewed."" C'mon dude, we have 2 cups in three years, I think we deserve a little credit for what we've accomplished. My favorite is when they say we have no mental toughness. Wasn't it so memorable that time we were down 3-0 in the first round of playoffs and then lost game 4 and got swept because of our lack of mental toughness? Oh...wait....no....we reverse swept and won 3 game 7s on the road and won the cup. That's right, how silly of me. And that's not even looking at 2012. If that shows lack of mental toughness, I don't know what the fuck constitutes a mentally tough team."
losangeleskings,30ag97,ToastedFireBomb,3,Thu Mar 26 06:25:47 2015 UTC,don't forget the 3 straight WCFs too. a couple injuries from 3 straight Cup appearances.
losangeleskings,30ag97,krucz36,1 point,Thu Mar 26 07:34:18 2015 UTC,"but obviously all of that was just luck/skewed stats, we obviously arent actually that good, really we are a shitty team that lucks out every year, duh."
losangeleskings,30ag97,ToastedFireBomb,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:24:38 2015 UTC,Don't forget the bribed referees.
losangeleskings,30ag97,krucz36,3,Thu Mar 26 21:25:43 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, that reminds me, do you have your share of the cash for this years post season? These refs are awfully impatient about what we owe them. But I mean, how else could we possibly do anything, right?"
losangeleskings,30ag97,ToastedFireBomb,12,Thu Mar 26 21:27:32 2015 UTC,i think we put the fear of god in them.  or at least the fear of raccoon jesus.
losangeleskings,30ag97,thvnkyouXbvsedsevn,4,Wed Mar 25 21:33:54 2015 UTC,And that's why people don't want the Kings in the playoffs because we've shown we can dominate the best teams in the league when the odds are greatly against us.

losangeleskings,30ag97,MyBrainReallyHurts,5,Wed Mar 25 21:31:59 2015 UTC,"-We are a very good team. The team that we played is better than us, though. If, God forbid, the Kings do the same thing they've done and make the SCF's, they will decimate just about any team in the league. They're too big, strong, and tenacious on the forecheck. Add Doughty and Quick on the backend and you have, well, the Kings.  We have to hope we make it to the Finals and they don't make it anywhere close.   That is the truth."

Season ticket holders sit in their season seats for playoff games and usually get a presale code to buy more. AMEX card holders have gotten a presale code in past seasons. Not sure if that will be the case this year though since the Kings changed from Ticketmaster.

losangeleskings,309dho,LOUD__NOISES,2,Wed Mar 25 17:46:10 2015 UTC,"I think we need more than 96 points. As the teams above us keep winning at a higher than normal percentage, their final points outcome has gone up. I think we'll need closer to 98-99 points to make it. Either as 3rd in the Pacific or a wild card. We need 12 points out of our remaining 9 games.  Let's say that our three games against EDM and SJ are wins, that's 6 points. We need 6-7 more points out of our remaining 6 games.  The fact that our games against NYI, MIN, CHI, VAN and CAL are on the road makes me sweat a bit. Unlike last year, we're only .500 on the road this season.  In the end I do think we'll make it, but I think it will come down to the last game or two."

I'm sure there are other things that would be good to know, but the best way of learning is by just watching and asking questions at that time and having someone explain it to you.  Hat trick: standard - 3 goals by one player in one game; Gordie Howe Hat Trick - a player scores a goal, records an assist, and gets in a fight all in one game  Defensive vs offensive - Defensive are generally better skaters, and tend to stay closer to the blue line when in the offensive zone, and closer to the goalie when in their defensive zone  Plays - ask Sutter ;)  Favorite Current King - Doughty if I really have to choose, because he is absolutely awesome and hilarious  History - read up on the 93 playoffs/finals, specifically the ""Stick Incident"", read up on the Gretzky trade (changed hockey forever)  Tickets - if the question is about money, then that's up to you. If the question is should you go to the game, the answer is always yes, especially against rivals like the Sharks  Fighting - The NHL has tried to tone it down and created harsher rules regarding instigating a fight, removing your helmet, etc  What else to do - watch as many games and go to as many games as possible :)"

losangeleskings,309gnq,RubyRhod,4,Wed Mar 25 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"Ducks now. The playoff format actually changed last year. So before the seeding really didn't matter based on what division you were in, only western conference and eastern conference. So the first round saw a lot of the cross-division matchups. We never even played the Ducks in the playoffs before and only recently played the Sharks.  Then they changed the format so it basically goes 1 seed vs WildCard Spot 1 and 2nd vs 3rd in each division. So it guarantees at least 4 total division 1st round playoff games.   We played the Sharks and Ducks last year in the same run. So it obviously worked as intended (increase rivalries). Which makes sense when you consider we play more games in the regular season against our own division.   The Canucks also don't like us very much, neither do the Yotes both because of our 2012 run. The Blues hate us because we beat them two years in a row 2012 and 2013. The Blackhawks hate us because we killed their ability to call themselves a dynasty. We hate them back for the same reason (beating us in 2013 in the WCF). Right now the Jets and Flames really don't like us because they have been shitty recently and we might take their playoff spot.   But really, everyone hates us right now because the thought of Playoff Mode Kings makes everyone shit bricks.   Also some East Coast teams hate us because we have a possession style of play (i.e. if your team has the puck longer, then the other team can't score as much) instead of a lot of run and gun fast paced games. We basically don't take very much risk and sort of smother teams, which is 'boring' for teams used to watching Ovechkin and Crosby. We actually have a good relationship with the Caps sub though."
losangeleskings,309gnq,RubyRhod,3,Wed Mar 25 18:42:26 2015 UTC,"Right on, that was very informative. I like that everyone hates us, reminds of high school."

losangeleskings,309gnq,IrishCreamPied,3,Wed Mar 25 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"How does getting into the playoffs work? I am only familiar with football (because of Fantasy football)   Theres 2 conferences with 2 divisions in each. Each conference has 8 teams make the playoffs, 3 from each division and then 2 wild cards which go to the top 2 remaining teams. The first 3 rounds are played within your conference and the final round is Western conference vs eastern conference.   I am getting familiar with Power Plays, off-sides, icing, the various Penalties (high sticking, tripping, etc.) but is there anything else I need to know that's vital to understanding the game?   hmm not sure.    What is a hat trick specifically?   This is when one player scores 3 goals in the same game. There is also a ""Gordie howe hat trick"" which isn't really as celebrated but thats when you get a Goal, an assist and a fight in the same game.   How can you tell a defensive player vs. an offensive player (like I know Doughty is one of the best defensive players, why?)   They have different roles but the easiest way is to tell their positioning. The 2 players closest to your own goalie are typically defensemen. Sometimes they'll move up on the rush or something though.   How are plays made? Maybe I shouldn't compare it to football, but I was sitting in row 3 at the LA v Vancouver game behind the player box and saw them writing plays out on the little clipboard, is there a general thing I can pay attention to, so that I may understand better?   They have some set plays but this is not usually the case for most of the game. The team usually has a system they use so each player knows their role and where to be and what to do.   Who is your favorite player on the kings (currently) and why?   That's hard. I love Mike Richards but he's declined so much I guess I will go with Tanner Pearson. I've loved watching that kid grow and can't wait for him to return.   What's some history about the Kings that I should know about?   There's some books on the Kings that maybe you should read. At least get Bob Miller's book, that should be a good starting place.   Should I get tickets to the Sharks v Kings at the last game of the season?   Yes, thats a game vs our biggest rival. Also the last game of the season the team usually gives away a ton of stuff in the game which is alwasy cool.   What's with the fighting or should I say lack of? This may be a silly question, but I remember as a kid fighting was huge in hockey, though this is NOT the sole reason I want to watch it; it seems like it's calmed down a bit. Why is that?   They wanted to tone down the violent aspect of the sport. They still happen but not as frequently. Some people think it will be banned eventually.   What else could I do to better familiarize myself with the sport?   Keep watching. But also if you play video games get an NHL video game. That helped me"
losangeleskings,309gnq,Growingpain,2,Wed Mar 25 16:56:32 2015 UTC,"Regarding a Forward vs a Defense skater.  A foward's main goal...in general is to create plays, get into open space and put the put the puck toward the net (hopefully resulting in a goal).  Their defensive responsibilities are very light...typically one forward has to hang back high in the zone to help the defense when the other team inevitably gets the puck and turns it back the other way.  a Defenceman has more of a responsibility to read plays and make sure the puck stays in front of them...either by protecting the blue line putting the puck down low again, or put the puck on net.  If the other team gets the puck, they in general have to skate backwards and try to regain control of the puck.  Defencemen make more ""judgement calls"" as to when to join the play and when to hold back to make sure the other team is adequately defended.  Regarding ""Plays"":  In general hockey players ""improv"".  They skate to open areas, and make themselves available to receive passes. They fight down low for pucks...throw checks and such.    A hockey play tries to eliminate some of the ""improv"" by per-determining where players are going to be...where to pass the puck and such."
losangeleskings,30a347,krucz36,3,Wed Mar 25 18:27:58 2015 UTC,Geez. I still can't believe how insane the run for the cup was last year. They won 3 game 7's in a row.

The Ducks series was scary because it's so close to home and they always seem to have our number. The way it ended though. Mmmm.

losangeleskings,30acrn,EinsamWulf,5,Wed Mar 25 20:24:43 2015 UTC,"a rich history that doesn't include 40 years of mediocrity.   Which in reality is:   A franchise born from a Disney film...   It's the typical ""fuck the Kings"" mentality, it really is nothing to be concerned about. They spend more time talking about us than we do about them. Why is this? Because of the incredible success this franchise has had in the last few years. The big dog will always be the target of little jabs like this, it happens in every sport.  As soon as I saw the username I knew what to expect. Honestly I wouldn't even suggest you give these guys the time of day. There are some great fans from every team that populate /r/Hockey and I would much rather hang and chat with them. Case in point: /u/Yogi_the_duck.  edit: Case in point, not ""and""."
losangeleskings,30acrn,EinsamWulf,3,Wed Mar 25 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"I couldn't believe the rich history bit. I mean granted Selanne is legend and they have a place in the birth of California hockey, but to even suggest that the Kings' history is subpar to the Ducks' history is just pure blasphemy. I typically show Duck fans respect and get a few laughs after seeing their OCD posts about how they hate the Kings, but this post for some reason drives me nuts."
losangeleskings,30acrn,Yogi_the_duck,5,Wed Mar 25 20:22:09 2015 UTC,Like any fanbase there are good people and then there are ones that suck. Selanne is indeed a legend in the sport.  The rivalry between LA and Anaheim creates some truly amazing games but some people let it go to their heads.
losangeleskings,30acrn,GaboKopiBrown,6,Wed Mar 25 20:30:15 2015 UTC,"Where do I begin...   Why would you hate us? Unlike LA, half of our lineup isn't currently on parole, we have decent uniforms and a rich history that doesn't include 40 years of mediocrity.   Ok so...   LA   This means Los Angeles   Half of our lineup isn't currently on parole   All at face value here: This is a reference to Voynov, who is still under investigation and not on parole. In fact, not even being held in any sort of jail or institution. ""But he's still a bad guy!"" Ok, so that means (since we're just going to say people are bad people based on testimony and not a hearing) that former duck Sheldon Souray is also a bad guy. He's also a much, much bigger guy and could absolutely dole out some serious damage to someone he wanted to hurt. Also, Voynov took his wife out of Russia. It's not the best place in the world, but at least he didn't make her stop being an actress.   We have decent uniforms   Yeah, they do now. The plain text ""Ducks"" jerseys were terrible, unimaginative, and as a jersey collector just plain boring. I have one from 2008 that I bought because it had the Cup patch on it and I knew it would be worth something even at 15 years old. Also, how can you say that the LA jerseys aren't, at the very least, decent? The logo is clean, and the uniforms (blank) look great. Can't really fuck up black and white.   a rich history that doesn't include 40 years of mediocrity   Look guys I'll be honest here. I'm all for using the ""WHO WON IT FIRST"" line or the argument that the Ducks won in 14 and then Kings took almost 4 times that amount of time to do it. But I also see validity in ""WHO HAS MORE"". Honest chirping is honest chirping. But to say that the Kings don't have a rich history and that the Ducks' history is richer is sort of laughable. 16 former Kings are HOFers, The Triple Crown line era was bad assery, McNall got Pocklington to trade GRETZKY McSorley and Krushelnyski, to the Kings for Carson (WHEN EDM DIDN'T EVEN WANT HIM, THEY WANTED LUC), Martin Gelinas, $15 million in cash, and the Kings' first-round draft picks in 1989 (later traded to the New Jersey Devils – New Jersey selected Jason Miller), 1991 (Martin Rucinsky), and 1993 (Nick Stajduhar) which can be better summarized as ""an trade so heavily favored towards the Kings that A MEMBER CANADIAN GOVERNMENT DEMANDED THE TRADE BE BLOCKED. 4 Conference final appearances (3 series wins), 3 Stanley Cup appearances, 2 Stanley Cup wins, and in dramatic fashion both times. Now, the Ducks have history as well. Drafting Kariya, the Teemu Trade, the drafting of Perry and Getzlaf, Cup finals appearances (2), 1 Stanley cup, bringing together Travis Moen, Chris Pronger, both Niedermayer brothers, and of course Selanne to win it. Neither team has a deep history like Montreal or Boston, but to say that neither team has a rich history or that one or the other was ""more mediocre"" is preposterous.  I don't know guys, there's a lot of bullshit in fandom. Especially on the internet where keyboard warriors can sit down and say shit with absolutely no face-to-face confrontation or the ability to have a fluid conversation back and forth with people. I've had great conversations with people from so many different fan bases. I work with 3 Kings fans and a Bruins fan, my neighbor is a Wild fan, my exes were Ducks, Kings, and Hawks fans, and I've had countless conversations and debates that were constructive and fun to have with plenty of you redditors and the shit that I hate is ""fuck you"" and unnecessary digs at other fanbases and teams.   Talk to eachother, not at eachother.   edit: great one"

Chirping is chirping, but to simply say a team sucks or has no history when that's clearly not true is just bold stupidity. I hate the ducks as much as any other kings fan, but I can still step back and admit how dominant and scary they are as a team. Just because I dislike them doesn't mean I can't acknowledge their skill."

losangeleskings,307dcb,Just2d2,15,Wed Mar 25 02:07:33 2015 UTC,Two big wins. Not only was it a back-to-back but the second game was against the hot Rangers. Huge wins.   Kings need to win the 5 of the next 9 games to get to 96 points which usually gets a playoff spot. #TheRoadTo96.
losangeleskings,307dcb,OverlordKopi_2037,5,Wed Mar 25 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"Devils game wasn't as big as Rangers though. I fully expected Kings to beat the Devils, but I wasn't sure about the Rangers. Especially when I saw them score in the first minute.   5 out of 9 shouldn't be that hard to get. We only need to watch out that we don't give any points to the teams that we're up against - Minnesota, Calgary and Vancouver.   Other than that, I just saw that we have 2 Edmonton games coming up."

Damn, I liked the Flames and Jets, but now, fuck' em. I hope the Flames choke miserably and we take their spot.

losangeleskings,307xk3,OverlordKopi_2037,6,Wed Mar 25 04:38:31 2015 UTC,I didn't realize until I checked how difficult the Jets' remaining schedule is compared to even ours. We just need to make a serious push this road trip and we'll get that wild card spot.
losangeleskings,307xk3,BagelzAllDay,3,Wed Mar 25 07:42:42 2015 UTC,3 more hard games until we get to play the oilers twice and play the people we are fighting the spot for (i.e. control our own destiny). But we should probably just win all 9 just in case.
losangeleskings,307xk3,RubyRhod,7,Wed Mar 25 18:31:18 2015 UTC,"I think at this point, it's 100% between the Kings, Flames, and Jets.  I like our odds."
losangeleskings,307xk3,LOUD__NOISES,4,Wed Mar 25 04:50:30 2015 UTC,"I figured Minnesota isn't really a concern on on our standing anymore, but we still need to beat them later this week!"
losangeleskings,307xk3,Zanchbot,6,Wed Mar 25 04:39:34 2015 UTC,The game that has me most nervous on this trip is the one in Chicago. I think we can beat Minnesota.
losangeleskings,307xk3,TheEw0kGamer,2,Wed Mar 25 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"Chicago always worries me. Unless the play is paced and on Kings tempo, they cut our defence like butter. In which I hope to god Quick is a brick wall that night. Either that or Carter/Kopitar just make it rain points on their lines and stuff the net like a Thanksgiving Turkey."
losangeleskings,307xk3,Zanchbot,2,Wed Mar 25 17:41:15 2015 UTC,Without Kane maybe it won't be so easy for them to make such quick work of our defense. Sharp's still a motherfucker against us though.
losangeleskings,307xk3,TheEw0kGamer,2,Wed Mar 25 17:52:28 2015 UTC,True. Their second line is their first against us especially with Kane hoisting it offensively. But I can only hope that Sharp continues with the rough season he's been having. Hossa is also someone who turns it on against us. But fuck it. We need that win for more than points. It'll be a huge boost to Morale
losangeleskings,307xk3,Zanchbot,5,Wed Mar 25 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"Took me 2 periods to decide I was ""rooting"" for the Canucks. Ultimately I saw reason and realized it's better for us."
losangeleskings,307xk3,TheEw0kGamer,2,Wed Mar 25 15:50:37 2015 UTC,I felt the same. I dislike the Canucks more than I do Winnipeg. Especially after that last game. But they're too far ahead with games in hand. The Jets are a more likely shot for us.
losangeleskings,306klt,Ghost00,12,Tue Mar 24 22:00:44 2015 UTC,This is going to be a long game.
losangeleskings,306klt,BiohazardPixie,7,Tue Mar 24 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"It's 1-1, but we're inches away from it being 4-3."

losangeleskings,306klt,Sniffman,3,Wed Mar 25 01:30:39 2015 UTC,What did you guys think of Richards/Martinez performance yesterday?
losangeleskings,306klt,HadADat,3,Tue Mar 24 22:01:56 2015 UTC,"Martinez played great! Richards was okay, I felt he was a little slow in the third but I felt he played a pretty good game until then. I liked him better than Stoll's been playing lately and a great deal better than andreoff. small sample size but still!"
losangeleskings,306klt,KobeBasedGod24,3,Tue Mar 24 22:15:56 2015 UTC,for having not played with the team in so long I thought they did pretty well.

losangeleskings,306klt,KeanuReavers,4,Tue Mar 24 23:37:31 2015 UTC,Canucks.  We have a better chance at catching the jets.   At least right now.   Its too bad. I like the jets and how they play.
losangeleskings,306klt,BiohazardPixie,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:50:11 2015 UTC,We have to play the Canucks again so I'd like to see them get ruined at every possible chance.
losangeleskings,306klt,SorryNoSorry,3,Wed Mar 25 00:14:39 2015 UTC,"Great question.  I agree with the Jets, because they're in the Central.  But really, just make sure only 1 team gets any points I guess."
losangeleskings,306klt,TheEw0kGamer,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:40:01 2015 UTC,OT would be a disaster yeah.
losangeleskings,306klt,The_Creepin_Kitten,3,Wed Mar 25 00:14:26 2015 UTC,"Arena burns down and game is canceled > Canucks win in regulation > Jets win in regulation > Canucks win in OT.  I think VAN is the lesser of two evils here because it's more of a longshot that we'll take their place. Jets are a more immediate threat right now... but on second thought, VAN is in our division so if we somehow manage to overtake them, we're more securely in the playoffs. Ugh."
losangeleskings,306klt,Jericho111091,2,Tue Mar 24 23:41:55 2015 UTC,"I feel we're unlikely to get wildcard unless Wild's goalie issues come back or the Jets ultimately collapse.  We're 4 points behind both teams, Jets have one game over us though, but they're reallllly hot right now, and we have to play the Canucks so seeing them get crushed at every opportunity is gonna be helpful.  Also Gaborik scored as I was typing this so- definitely sticking with the Jets."

losangeleskings,306klt,is45toooldforreddit,2,Tue Mar 24 23:08:21 2015 UTC,I think Jones will start against the Islanders so Quick can be fresh for MIN and CHI.
losangeleskings,306klt,Fuser55,2,Tue Mar 24 22:53:03 2015 UTC,We can't be too sure with sutter
losangeleskings,306klt,fresh_,3,Tue Mar 24 22:54:52 2015 UTC,"aaand I'm not 100% sure Jones is the better option....I think Quickie has made a conscious effort to turn it on of late and his play is showing that....if any of the 3 games he would have sat, I thought it would have been against NJD IMO"

I love all 3 of em."
losangeleskings,307v7r,sandypheet,7,Wed Mar 25 04:21:47 2015 UTC,"Plus he's a bargain. We get a no nonsense 4th line power forward willing to throw down for cheap. We love to hate on him, but we all love Nolan deep down."
losangeleskings,307v7r,OverlordKopi_2037,0,Wed Mar 25 04:48:30 2015 UTC,Would it be terrible to say that I haven't seen any of the things you list from Nolan in the past couple of months?   Cliffy is far more noticeable in these aspects than King and especially Nolan.
losangeleskings,307v7r,thegetawayplan9,17,Wed Mar 25 04:47:20 2015 UTC,Nolan has been playing pretty well since the all star break...
losangeleskings,307v7r,KlirisChi,13,Wed Mar 25 06:00:09 2015 UTC,"Have you been watching the same Kings I have?  After his shitty first half of the season, Nolan has completely turned it on this past month plus."
losangeleskings,307v7r,alexftw,6,Wed Mar 25 05:09:48 2015 UTC,"While what they say about Nolan is true, and he has been playing better since the ASB, the listed attributes are Nolan firing on all cylinders, which just doesn't happen much. He's a 4th liner with decent upside for a 4th liner. He was good for the Cup run in '12, then disappeared until about a month ago. He's only got a spot because Andreoff is somehow worse and they won't give a shot to anyone else in Manch for some reason."
losangeleskings,307v7r,Lsky72,2,Wed Mar 25 06:14:54 2015 UTC,"Anyone got a gif of that blue line snipe Nolan had not too long ago?  You know, that one that made you go ""That was Nolan?"""
losangeleskings,307v7r,neekohlai,9,Wed Mar 25 15:51:12 2015 UTC,I got you! I think it was from just above the circle though.  I was at that game and my jaw dropped when he scored.  Here's the gif.  Here's the video.
losangeleskings,307v7r,blueliner17,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:37:00 2015 UTC,"Nolan understands and performs what is expected from him within the Kings system.  The depth players are not expected to show up on the score sheet every game, but that doesn't mean they aren't contributing.  With the salary cap, no team can afford to have ""top 6"" players on the 3rd and 4th lines.    However, if you look at the Kings, they are able to play guys like Brown and Richards on the bottom 2 lines (by swapping someone like King, Lewis or occasionally Nolan onto one of the top lines)    This depth they have all the way down the lineup is pretty much unmatched in the league.  For example, look at the way the Kings abused the Rangers 4th line yesterday"

losangeleskings,3029kh,LAKingsDave,2,Tue Mar 24 00:40:41 2015 UTC,I feel like we never score in the 2nd

losangeleskings,300b1g,evarga,2,Mon Mar 23 13:53:48 2015 UTC,The stat I always remember they mentioned before that game was that March 23rd was the only day in March that Gretzky had never scored a goal in any year in his career. Then boom.
losangeleskings,300b1g,Gunslinger_,3,Mon Mar 23 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah? What about August 73rd? I bet he never scored then! Checkmate, atheists."

I'm not even old enough to drink yet, and in that time of youth I've seen the team ooze pure suck and pick high, I've seen Kopi and Dewy become two elite NHL player and Brownie grow into a captain, and to top it all off two Cups raised. God what a time to be young"
losangeleskings,300dd2,SoloSkeptik,22,Mon Mar 23 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"I think I'm still partial to this one, a hit so bonecrushing they made an entire Stanley Cup Moments episode about it."
losangeleskings,300dd2,Zanchbot,6,Mon Mar 23 15:34:46 2015 UTC,Brings a tear to my eye. God I wish Brown could play like that all season.
losangeleskings,300dd2,McGillicutty_192,3,Mon Mar 23 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"Brown has learned that he has to pick his spots in order to be effective when needed. He can not play 82 games at this pace, nobody can."
losangeleskings,300dd2,bryan_sensei,3,Mon Mar 23 17:28:00 2015 UTC,Always just takes one of these highlights to get me pumped. We got this shiz.
losangeleskings,300dd2,Enthusiasm-Curbed,3,Mon Mar 23 17:36:22 2015 UTC,Yeah it's not even a contest. That hit on Henrik is the best hit in franchise history.  It also lead to Kopitar's first and only fight.
losangeleskings,300dd2,davidprevails,3,Mon Mar 23 18:49:00 2015 UTC,This is the right answer based solely on the fact that Sedin knocks on the door for someone to let him in.
losangeleskings,300dd2,hopesfail,2,Tue Mar 24 01:19:33 2015 UTC,Still my favorite.
losangeleskings,300dd2,ltsReno,2,Mon Mar 23 20:22:08 2015 UTC,My rib cage and shoulder broke watching this.
losangeleskings,300dd2,Trevoc555,2,Mon Mar 23 20:23:25 2015 UTC,if there's ever a statue of Brown outside of Staples Center it should be of that hit.
losangeleskings,300dd2,Jericho111091,2,Mon Mar 23 21:24:56 2015 UTC,I love this hit so much. He almost hit the ginger out of him.
losangeleskings,300dd2,JJinVenice,3,Tue Mar 24 04:19:57 2015 UTC,Because Corey Perry.

losangeleskings,300dd2,blueliner17,3,Tue Mar 24 02:46:01 2015 UTC,How on earth does Brown end up with a penalty there?
losangeleskings,300dd2,bryan_sensei,5,Mon Mar 23 17:21:48 2015 UTC,Because it's his fault he got jumped by 2 Ducks after a clean hit. /s
losangeleskings,300dd2,Spade490,4,Mon Mar 23 17:29:18 2015 UTC,2 minutes for being Dustin Brown
losangeleskings,300dd2,Zanchbot,3,Mon Mar 23 20:08:37 2015 UTC,Bad officiating. Still came away with a PP that we then scored on.
losangeleskings,300dd2,boltsteve,3,Mon Mar 23 17:29:51 2015 UTC,"No offense to you since I've heard a few people say the same thing, but I don't buy this excuse. Yes, the Kings got a PP and scored but they should have had a 5-3 and may have scored twice. Could have been an entirely different game if the referees called it correctly. Brown did nothing wrong and was cross checked and roughed."
losangeleskings,300dd2,Seanismadlolz,3,Tue Mar 24 03:47:46 2015 UTC,"That was a great hit, albeit this is my favorite."

I had hockeystreams for a while, and I definitely worth it. You can watch any game from pretty a lot of leagues, and it's not too expensive. There's also ragecenter.

losangeleskings,302pmo,joeloud,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:32:10 2015 UTC,for reliability and quality Game Center with a VPN is the way to go. If you get the VPN first before you purchase you can get it for the international rate which is usually half off. VPN thru unblock-us.com is $5 per month and you can turn it off when the season is off. thats what i currently do and i can watch all the games on my phone/computer or hooked up to the tv. they support Apple TV as well so you would be pretty well covered.   thats my current set up and have been running it for about 2-3 years. i got fed up with the crappy feed qualities and drops. any questions let me know

Cliffy, Nolan, Kinger and McNugget in my opinion have been the most fun part of this season due to them showing great improvement.  And on the opposite side of the spectrum, I think RR and McBain have been the biggest disappointments this season.

losangeleskings,300e6n,CrispyLardon,7,Mon Mar 23 15:01:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think McBain has been a disappointment, more of a ""met expectations"" for a guy who was a mid-season free agent who we signed for the league minimum."

losangeleskings,300e6n,another_handle,7,Tue Mar 24 02:24:58 2015 UTC,Clifford's been the biggest improvement I think.
losangeleskings,300e6n,AKxTrah,5,Mon Mar 23 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"I think Trevor Lewis is having a hell of a season.  Yeah he has missed some pretty great chances at net but he has been great either at center or wing, fits in so many lines, and has been a pretty effective penalty killer."
losangeleskings,300e6n,Omnivirus,8,Mon Mar 23 15:07:23 2015 UTC,"Carter.  He is twice the player he was when he came over. The stint with Team Canada last year carried over into the playoff run, and he's been outstanding this season- his line has basically carried the Kings all season, no matter who they've put on it. He's playing in every situation, and he, along with Gaborik, are the two offensive game changers on this team. Kopi has been too passive this season, Drew has had his hands full doing basically everything for the team, so it's fallen on El Jefe, and he's responded."
losangeleskings,300e6n,Sniffman,4,Mon Mar 23 15:07:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like Carter is a given. Without a doubt, he has been the best acquisition in years...even better than Gaborik."

losangeleskings,300e6n,KingsfanMDJ,3,Mon Mar 23 15:19:41 2015 UTC,But Holy Toffoli isn't a surprise. We expect him to generate points.
losangeleskings,300e6n,dudenumbertwo,3,Mon Mar 23 16:04:58 2015 UTC,"Carter, Toffoli, Lewis come to mind. Carter's always been great for us, but moving him to center has made him even more effective. Toffoli's looked a lot more consistent this season than in the past couple, and at this rate he'll be a legitimate star on this team really soon. Lewis is having a career year, though he has had the benefit of playing with Kopi and Gabbo sometimes and he's made great use of that time instead of being a drag on that line."

Right now Calgary's magic number (and given that Calgary is the team ahead of us in the standings, they're the one's we care about) is 23. By virtue of the fact that we have 11 games remaining, ours is 22 (number of games * number of possible points)  So if we win and they lose, their number will drop by 4 (two for our win, two for their loss) and ours will drop by 2 (one game played).  Therefore, we would be ahead by 1 magic number point. (Because we would be tied with a game in hand).  ....  and after typing all that out I realize that your method is simpler..."

losangeleskings,2zxw3c,BiohazardPixie,3,Sun Mar 22 21:14:00 2015 UTC,"yeah he seems a little smarter  about his ""4th line duties""... but its also nice not having a sinking feeling when in an odd change he gets stuck on the ice for another rush and hes beside kopi and gaborik. that shit used to scare the hell out of me cuz for a while it was like he couldnt complete a single clean play. lately hes just been making the right things happen."
losangeleskings,2zxw3c,ItsOFbuttercup,2,Sun Mar 22 21:28:04 2015 UTC,It seems like he's taken on a different role. I'd say Clifford has been more of our enforcer this season.  It's nice seeing him lead by example and play hard when he gets lined up with our rooks.
losangeleskings,2zxw3c,AKxTrah,5,Mon Mar 23 03:36:05 2015 UTC,"I've always liked his jump and chippy ness, and never really understood the hate. He has two cups, I think that gets overlooked a lot. Would love to see him keep getting ice time."
losangeleskings,2zxw3c,AKxTrah,2,Mon Mar 23 00:45:05 2015 UTC,"the only things anyone has really had to complain about with him was taking a few too many penalties, and that he often exhibited some good ol brick mitts... but that shit just seems to have tapered off"
losangeleskings,2zxw3c,lak11,3,Mon Mar 23 04:34:34 2015 UTC,Yeah but I mean compared to others cough stoll cough. No I really don't mean to smack on stoll either I really like him just couldn't resist. Given the role Nolan is in I am really happy by the way he plays and yes I agree with your point and also that it is tapering. I just hope he throws some more pucks at net and gets weird goals!
losangeleskings,2zxw3c,CrispyLardon,4,Mon Mar 23 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"It's nice to see him get some positive recognition lately as opposed to the usual hate he gets. The guy works his ass off every time he's on the ice and has really cut down on taking penalties. I also think signing a new contract might have motivated him quite a bit, he's been playing really well since then it seems. I'm happy for him."
losangeleskings,2zxw3c,Jericho111091,3,Sun Mar 22 23:42:11 2015 UTC,"I am so down with this--I mentioned it the other day, too.   Nolan, Cliffy, Kinger and McNugget are really showing up in the improvement department. Makes me damn excited for the future."
losangeleskings,2zxw3c,thegetawayplan9,2,Sun Mar 22 23:21:24 2015 UTC,yeah the guys in that end of the lineup have won us more than just a few games this season when our big guns have had scoring gaps... not to mention what they do on the defensive end of the ice
losangeleskings,2zxw3c,Cbomb112,3,Mon Mar 23 04:27:32 2015 UTC,He's been doing pretty well for the last few weeks
losangeleskings,2zxw3c,SoloSkeptik,2,Mon Mar 23 05:03:04 2015 UTC,i hate him but dudes been good lately. I'm glad he's making me eat my words

losangeleskings,2zx1ky,thegetawayplan9,6,Sun Mar 22 17:48:12 2015 UTC,"Burrows was an embellisher at one point, but it has been a while. Also, let's not pretend that Brown doesn't go down easier than a ten dollar....well, you know."

losangeleskings,2zuktg,LOUD__NOISES,22,Sat Mar 21 22:36:45 2015 UTC,"wrong, it will be because our 4 on 4 play in OT sucks, shoot out success, and collapses in the third period. Not this single game, the conference is so close that issues that plague a team all year ends up costing them a spot. You have to correct your flaws as the season goes on, we haven't found a fix for these."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,BlueMoonFC,4,Sat Mar 21 22:49:40 2015 UTC,Fixing 4 on 4 OT and the shootout are completely secondary to playing smart in a must-win game.
losangeleskings,2zuktg,LOUD__NOISES,10,Sat Mar 21 23:17:26 2015 UTC,"If the boys get 1/3 of those points, the situation they are in is vastly different. Its 82 games, not 12."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,BlueMoonFC,5,Sat Mar 21 23:36:06 2015 UTC,Disagree. Fans may bitch about the shootout but it's still part of the game. Teams need to treat it seriously.
losangeleskings,2zuktg,lordjedediah,5,Sun Mar 22 05:32:57 2015 UTC,Agreed. This was a must win. The Flames are playing arguably the best hockey they have played all season right now and don't look poised to lose more than 4 of the next 11. I have hope but I'm afraid we killed our chance at a playoff run today.

losangeleskings,2zuktg,hobonia,26,Sat Mar 21 23:36:36 2015 UTC,"As upset as I am about the game I'm getting really annoyed with the GDTs as of late.  Maybe I'm just some form of giant baby but having a coalition of what feels like every other fan on /r/hockey come in every game and wish failure on your team is incredibly irritating.  I generally love GDTs because they're usually a fun place to relax and chat during the games. Even when it's against a rival it's normally not too awful. But now it's full of people coming from every corner of the league, even from teams that we have no effect on, cheering for us to lose.  Maybe I'm just too sensitive but I'm starting to think about involving myself in them much less now. Maybe check in once per period but that's it. I really hate complaining so much but I needed to have this little rant."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,ImAnAfricanCanuck,38,Sat Mar 21 22:40:50 2015 UTC,"Take it as a compliment. when people hate youre team its because theyre extremely dominant. at the end of the day countless fans (who wont admit it) still respect what a team like the kings brings to the ice.  All of that being said, as a mod in /r/canucks I'd appriciate it if kings fans wouldnt come into our sub and start chirping, trolling and being offensive in general.   It'll result in bans, of course, but I'd rather have you guys come in, chat with us in our PGT (feel free to pop on a kings flair) and be respectful in that sense.   its off topic, but I thought this would be a good place to post that little bit, given that you were talking about GDTs."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,BW4LL,10,Sat Mar 21 23:14:14 2015 UTC,Yeah that stuff is uncalled for. It makes each teams sub look bad when a few apples do it. Lurk sure but don't be a goon.

Likewise, but with half your subs, I'm betting Kings fans get the losing end of that proposition.

losangeleskings,2zuktg,WitlessCanuck,8,Sun Mar 22 04:51:04 2015 UTC,"Don't take it personally. LA has had a lot of success lately, so teams that they beat in past years, are obviously wishing for LA's failure.   Then you have teams scraping for that final wild card spot (San Jose/Calgary) all hoping you lose, and then you have the teams that want an easier matchup in the second round that want LA to lose (Chicago/Ducks/Blues) so they don't have to deal with them.   You've got a team that has been dominate for several seasons now. You're going to have fans of other teams rooting against you. Just pull out the ol' ""Well, 2014 makes your hate a whole lot easier to deal with."" speech and don't worry about it."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,OverlordKopi_2037,2,Sat Mar 21 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it should be a badge of honor for you guys.   Take it from me, things are generally going a lot better when everybody hates you."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,WitlessCanuck,2,Sun Mar 22 01:53:12 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately we can't use that as a comeback either, because then we get even more shit on for being cocky or bandwagoners. I hate to whine, but it's pretty much a lose-lose situation for us on /r/hockey."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,sweetwattah,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:58:52 2015 UTC,"Again. Dude. Your team won the fucking Stanley Cup.   All else is moot.   Stop whining, there's no reason to. There's no lose-lose when your team literally won the thing every other fanbase and team wants to win.   You think it's peachy for the Canucks when all the other fanbases just mock that we have lost in Game 7 twice? It ain't. You take the victories you can. And the reason why people bug the Kings is because it's clear the fans DO get upset and angry despite the fact that they've won the cup. Why else would they do it? Other fans call LA fans bandwagoners because they can't take the mocking and trash talk. It's a part of the fanbase and culture. They do it on the ice, and the fans do it in the stands. Not every fan has too, but they have to understand it's said intentionally to get under the skin, just like on the ice.   So what if you don't make the playoffs this year? You've got one of the most stacked teams in the league. Live it up, and stop taking it all personal.   Shit I WISH the Canucks had this problem. Instead of ""Everyone hates us cause we won the Cup."" it's ""Everyone hates us, and we still lost the Cup."" lol   Just look at it all differently man."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,Sniffman,3,Sun Mar 22 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"Well I disagree with a few details, but I can relate to your comment overall. Saying there's no reason to be upset or to whine is fairly inaccurate. There is absolutely reason to, but yes we should try to rise above it. Also, I don't agree that just because we won it last year, we should be fine with playing poorly and missing the playoffs this year. I find that to be more of an excuse. I know we're a good team, and I definitely appreciate our success, but it doesn't mean we can't have that competitive spirit and get pissed when we shit the bed. As you implied, if we don't make it this year, we shouldn't all cry ""Woe is me"" and have a pity party, but I sure as shit am not going to reason that, since we won it last year, it kind of evens out so it's ok.      So that's my two cents. You're pretty much right with your main point. I know this is super dorky, but it's like debating the difference between ""Don't worry, be happy"" and ""hakuna matata"". It's good to have a positive outlook, and realize that things could always be worse so enjoy the positive. However, you can't just say ""Oh well, no biggie, who cares"" to everything either. I'd also like to point out that halfway through this comment I smoked some. Ok that's it for me."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,BW4LL,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:44:16 2015 UTC,You're right.   I just mean specifically when it comes to trash talk. Let it roll of your back and play the Stanley Cup card.   I'd give ANYTHING to be able to do the same. Sadly Vancouver Millionaires just doesn't exactly count.
losangeleskings,2zuktg,Sniffman,6,Sun Mar 22 15:42:24 2015 UTC,"YEah I personally think that's bullshit. Just like in /r/nba when teams who shouldn't care about the Lakers are bagging on the Lakers, it's ridiculous (Source, am Lakers fan)"
losangeleskings,2zuktg,BW4LL,10,Sun Mar 22 03:15:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, im not joining them for a while. I get pissed off way too easily by stupid comments like ""Quick is a bitch"" or other 29 fanbases going ""Fuck the Kings"""

As it's been said in this thread, people hate you because you're better.  Just how it is in the NHL. Everyone hated the Canucks during their back to back president's trophy. Now nobody cares because we well... suck. Good luck down the stretch, guys."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,Gaglardi,17,Sat Mar 21 23:51:51 2015 UTC,The refs did a horrible job at managing this game. They let to much shit go and they wonder why the players were chippy as fuck. These teams are battling for a spot and you can't let the game escalate like that. That said that was an idiotic play by Toffoli and Doughty that very well may have cost us our season.
losangeleskings,2zuktg,Shinobi801,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:39:02 2015 UTC,"They also missed one of the most blatant too many men calls I've seen this season. I also think that first goal was good, looked to be on the edge but still good"

losangeleskings,2zuktg,CrispyLardon,8,Sun Mar 22 04:19:48 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ Toffoli why would you do that? That penalty lost us the game big time. Our playoff chances are slowly looking worse and worse game by game. Kings aren't seeming to even try anymore, or they are, and their effort is just lack luster. I still have hope we can make it, but man this is getting painful."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,wil,13,Sat Mar 21 22:37:54 2015 UTC,It started with Doughty's terrible and pointless penalty.
losangeleskings,2zuktg,lordjedediah,4,Sat Mar 21 22:39:45 2015 UTC,"And ended with Toffoli with the HORRIBLE boarding. I mean come on... And then two EN goals without the Canucks even trying. Bah... Our road trip is already going to be hard enough, now we're 4 points behind too? Fuck me..."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,GaboKopiBrown,2,Sat Mar 21 22:41:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah Toff really shit the bed on that one. But if Doughty didn't get his penalty, Toff's wouldnt have happened--it's no excuse, but Doughty's was definitely the catalyst of a whole bunch of poopoo."

losangeleskings,2zuktg,Shinobi801,4,Sat Mar 21 22:45:50 2015 UTC,That cross check was malicious. Guy never saw it coming so wasn't ready for it. Him tumbling into the boards was foreseeable and toffoli has to live with that.
losangeleskings,2zuktg,_Taengoo_,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:51:34 2015 UTC,"Still a horrible penalty to take none the less. Watching the gif of it, it looked like Toffoli didn't really pay attention and just nailed him."

Regardless of the good will a lot of Kings fans have built up in /r/hockey because of good users like WoozleWuzzle et. al, Kings fans are kinda known for being pretty insufferable around there.

It's just the occasional guy who shows up and clearly doesn't know shit about hockey and jumped on the wagon in 2012 or whatever that makes you guys look bad.   We have the benefit/shortcoming of having a ton of fans on /r/hockey which can make us look bad mostly due to the sheer volume of idiots. I'm convinced there isn't really much of a difference between fanbases in terms of idiots on a per-capita basis. The only fanbase on /r/hockey that's routinely irritated me is (weirdly) the Stars. Which is odd, because I like the Stars. I'm just saying the reputation is there, deservedly or not."

Like, we didn't put up enough offense to begin with, as usual as of late, but come the third period we decided to just throw it away. Doughty took a mind blowingly stupid emotional penalty, and then Toff sealed the deal with a stupid emotional MAJOR penalty and frankly cheap hit. We were in this game until 6 minutes of PK were thrown at us, and we threw that at ourselves. We needed this win, badly, and we fucked it up, badly. We aren't out of it, but if we don't A) score more goals and B) start playing calmer and smarter we aren't going to make playoffs. It has to start now, no more bullshit, we are 3-4 points behind the 4 teams ahead of us and we need to make up that ground on this road trip, no excuses. Our scoring is pitiful. We just arent scoring. We have a lot of great chances, and we never find the back of the net. I can't even remember the last time we scored on a breakaway. We never seem to bear down on any of our best looks. Here's hoping we turn it around here, because teams that dont score dont play in april."

losangeleskings,2zuktg,Sniffman,11,Sat Mar 21 22:43:01 2015 UTC,I don't like the Kings that much either but is there a need for this comment? It's not like your playoff chances are better..
losangeleskings,2zuktg,GaboKopiBrown,2,Sat Mar 21 22:45:00 2015 UTC,"There is a need, for them. So they can get downvoted and then complain about how ""butthurt"" and ""salty"" we are. I'm just waiting for the edit to confirm this. It's been happening for a few months now. Our competitors come in our GTDs and other threads to say ""Fuck the Kings"" or some variation of ""beat the Kings"", and when we naturally downvote them, they complain like I described above. I get a laugh out of it either way."
losangeleskings,2zuktg,shoshiyoshi,2,Sun Mar 22 02:06:21 2015 UTC,What did we do to you? :(
losangeleskings,2zuktg,kiwirish,2,Sat Mar 21 22:47:36 2015 UTC,"Nothing really. I just like your rivals too much (Yotes, Blackhawks, Rangers, Ducks). It's nothing personal or anything. It's kind of like my relationship with the Canadiens. Love the players, don't like the team.   Then again, you gave us Bernier, so maybe it's not so bad :p"
losangeleskings,2zuktg,atallwhiteguy,0,Sat Mar 21 22:52:31 2015 UTC,"Gotta love how tense the Pacific is this year. Last year was pretty boring compared to what we have now, so I want it to be as dramatic and competitive as possible."

losangeleskings,2zujq0,Beetush,8,Sat Mar 21 22:34:43 2015 UTC,"Yeesh. Toffoli is one of those guys that's way too talented to be making hits like that. He might get suspended for this. Which, if he does, will hurt the Kings quite a bit down the stretch. Now is not the time for fuckery."
losangeleskings,2zujq0,MonkeyWithMachete,7,Sun Mar 22 02:50:07 2015 UTC,Doughty losing his temper and slashing and then this play right after were really disappointing. No discipline after getting put on their heels. Day games are the kings Achilles heel.
losangeleskings,2zujq0,SteveBruleMD,3,Sun Mar 22 03:29:39 2015 UTC,"Hawks fan here. I'll be really pissed if he gets a suspension that kills your chances of making the playoffs. I'm conflicted; I know how valuable Toffoli is, and I want a rematch of the WCF really badly, but that hit was Brutally poor form. Do Toff and Burrows have a history? I just cant figure out why he would do something so stupid."
losangeleskings,2zujq0,Phridgey,2,Sun Mar 22 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"It kinda looks like burrows turns a little awkwardly that might have helped him into the boards...  He's always been a clean player, so I can't imagine there was intent. Hopefully it was all just shitty luck.   But still a brutal mistake by Toff.   And thanks for being a bro and not all ""HURR DIRTY KINGS"" about it."
losangeleskings,2zujq0,RubeusShagrid,3,Sun Mar 22 16:48:48 2015 UTC,Hell yeah. I want that rematch. And I like Toff. Even if he looks like a serial killer.

losangeleskings,2zujq0,LOUD__NOISES,8,Sat Mar 21 22:42:56 2015 UTC,Stupid but not dirty. Dirty is intent to injure. There's no intent there.
losangeleskings,2zujq0,thegetawayplan9,5,Sat Mar 21 23:51:59 2015 UTC,I'll be surprised if he's suspended. I'm betting a fine and a warning.

losangeleskings,2zujq0,JustBeLazy,3,Sun Mar 22 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"The way I saw this, the nucks were playing a hard agressive game, trying to avoid a similar game to our last meeting, really pushing buttons. We got put on our heels and from the top down started playing sloppily. Drew takes his slash, Toffoli tries to get something started and shake up a star player, misjudged how far he was from the boards, Burrows trys to sell it a bit more than he should and ends up hitting the boards pretty good. Burrows gets shaken up, Tylers gets a deserved 5 minutes, imo which is just that of a fan, I think a fine and a warning. If they want to be incredibly hard on this, 2 games max. Anyone calling for 3+ clearly didnt watch the game and just saw the last bit of the hit. I think you need to look at the bigger picture and not just the hit, but the scenario of the hit."
losangeleskings,2zujq0,wil,3,Sun Mar 22 16:11:50 2015 UTC,Just an idiotic hit. Toffoli ought to know better than that.
losangeleskings,2zujq0,manguitarguy,7,Sat Mar 21 23:09:22 2015 UTC,"That hit cost the Kings the game, and if Toffoli is suspended upon review, it could very well end up costing the Kings the post season, too."

losangeleskings,2zujq0,Sean_Bean_,-3,Sat Mar 21 22:54:37 2015 UTC,it seems toffoli was just trying to finish his check.   It had been a rough shift and you can't fault him for that.  He made the hit too late he should have stopped when burrows started to turn.   Hopefully he doesn't get suspended for this hit.
losangeleskings,2zujq0,drcujo,3,Sun Mar 22 00:32:32 2015 UTC,No idea why youre getting rocked for this. I agree completely.
losangeleskings,2zujq0,lordjedediah,3,Sun Mar 22 16:05:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't even notice until your comment.  There were lots of canucks fans here yesterday.  Judging by the gdt they wanted blood.   Maybe it was kings fans, I hope they realize I said nothing untrue, and that I agree tofolli was in the wrong."
losangeleskings,2zujq0,WallisBC,-18,Sun Mar 22 16:32:06 2015 UTC,Don't really feel bad that it was Burrows. I hate that guy.  Don't really care if I get downvoted. Fuck him. He's a piece of shit.  He literally bit a dude.
losangeleskings,2zujq0,lordjedediah,18,Sat Mar 21 22:36:31 2015 UTC,You mean when Marchand shoved hit fingers in burrows mouth?  What's he supposed to do?  Take em deep and tongue the balls?  FFS.

losangeleskings,2zujq0,wil,-15,Sun Mar 22 01:47:03 2015 UTC,"That is probably the weakest hit I've ever seen to cause or be called boarding so I will not call it dirty we've all seen plays/hits that we're made with malicious intent. I won't go as far as saying it was a dive but, it is burrows so there's that and he didn't put himself in the best position. If you look at burrows feet for before the hit to the contact we know tyler doesn't hit that hard to make some one bigger than him go 3 feet into the boards from a push to the hip. To me this highlighted a game full of just bad inconsistent officiating, they didn't know whether to let things happen or keep things calm Vancouver got away with a lot of bullshit today and got 2 points they didn't fully deserve. With that said, praise be Martinez, go kings go, and fuck the Sedins."
losangeleskings,2zujq0,zattk94,12,Sat Mar 21 23:26:09 2015 UTC,"That happened right in front of me, and I can assure you that it was not a weak hit."

I hope the boys push through to the playoffs, really feel like we need to cut the faking the slap shot move and just get the puck towards the net.

losangeleskings,2zu20u,BadAtThisKindOfThing,-11,Sat Mar 21 22:16:16 2015 UTC,"Burrows has a history of diving. Toffoli hit him from behind, but it wasn't THAT close to the boards.

I know I sound salty, but Raccoon Jesus Fucking Christ! (Praise and whatnot)"

losangeleskings,2zu20u,pbjamm,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:54:42 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a legit call as he seemed really hurt...then he returned to the game a few minutes later.  Guess they used some of that magic soccer cold spray.  Toff deserved cross checking for sure, maybe double minor,  but Burrows sold the injury for the major.  Kings D is just not up to the task this season so I have lost hope for another run at the Cup."
losangeleskings,2zu20u,matty86,2,Sat Mar 21 22:54:24 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the Bernier boarding call in game 6 a couple years back.

We had just watched the Key & Peele sketch before the game and thought the SAME thing when he came back You're absolutely right, hitting like that isn't safe, deserves a call. What bugged me is that I honestly think Burrows made it worse for himself by trying to sell the call"
losangeleskings,2zu20u,EinsamWulf,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:00:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah he was down pretty hard, that was a brutal hit, hopefully he just got his bell rung a bit and will be fine."

Scanning the page about the Kings for your reading pleasure.  The bad news is that the THN ranked the Kings as having the second worst crop of prospects in the league, ahead of only New Jersey. The worse news is that the Ducks rated the second best group of prospects, behind only Winnipeg. The major consolation is that the Kings group is considered so poor only because people like Toffoli, Pearson, and Muzzin are already making an impact in the NHL. In the past, the Kings were ranked much better: here are their rankings from 2008 - 2014: 5th, 1st, 1st, 2nd, 22nd, 28th, and 26th."

losangeleskings,2zqmn7,BlueApple10,3,Fri Mar 20 22:42:34 2015 UTC,"We probably won't see McBain again seeing as how he is basically  just a lesser version of Sekera. McNabb has really impressed me this year, especially for such a young guy. Robyn Reghier has played terribly because he's basically a living, breathing pylon that can block some shots on the PK, but not much else. Who should sit in place of Martinez? IMO it should be RR. That way our pairing could be 6-8, 3-7, and 27-2. Who will most likely be sat in place of Martinez? McNabb, because this world is not fair and we can't always get what we want."
losangeleskings,2zqmn7,dalbtraps,3,Sat Mar 21 01:20:34 2015 UTC,Me too. I can't see it happening though based on ice time. Greene or McNabb are the most likely.

losangeleskings,2zqmn7,dalbtraps,3,Sat Mar 21 00:02:50 2015 UTC,Well I'd say Greene sitting is a possibility. He was a healthy scratch quite a bit last season even though he had seniority over Muzz and Martinez.

losangeleskings,2zqbhk,burn_the_calories,21,Fri Mar 20 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"Hate is a gigantic part of our society now. Instead of people looking up to those who do things well and work and grind and eventually become successful; they're looked at with disdain. Almost like the hard work paying off is a bad thing. Seems like a lot of people try once or twice and fail and give up on something and then turn around and hate on the people who can do that certain thing well. Just like that thread from the Coyotes sub that someone cross posted the other day. That ""definition of a one sided rivalry"" thread. It's that their team hasn't done what ours has and so ""fuck those guys"" comes out instead of ""I wonder what they did that we didn't? What could we change to win?"" and that's what's pathetic. But people do that in real life. Look at how many people you thought you were close to that either turned on you or made comments telling you to give up on something you were working on. People told me I wasn't funny or that my material just wasn't good enough to do stand up. They said that I should just give up because ""they cared"". Well guess what, this dude is doing a show in San Clemente next month because I worked for it. Then, those people will hate on the success. People don't want to work for the success so they want to bring you down to their level. The hate is misplaced jealousy. So yes, they hate us cuz they ain't us.   As for fans who are upset because it's ""win it all or fuck it"" they're not real fans. Look at the struggles we've faced this year and tell me that we aren't doing well. To make the fucking playoffs in itself is a feat in the most competitive league in the world and the highest skill and the best players. Those people either A) don't understand the league B) don't care enough to follow, or C) are paper fans who hop on and off the band wagon when it suits them. Know what I say to that? Fuck right off.

losangeleskings,2zqbhk,CrispyLardon,5,Fri Mar 20 22:04:06 2015 UTC,"Damn dude, you need to get Weapons Release Authority before you start dropping truth bombs of that magnitude.  In sports it's tough to cheer for a team that continually loses games (yes Houston I will still be cheering for your come Baseball season) and as such that negativity can really start to get to peoples heads, it makes it even harder when all you can really do as a fan is cheer. That isn't to say that if your chosen team sucks you should just throw your jersey in the towel but there is something to be said about having the power to make the change yourself. If I'm playing a game of Hockey and we're getting killed, I know that I can take it upon myself to fall on my face the second someone gives me the puck to get one (or a few) in the net and turn the game around. If the Kings are playing terribly, I can't really have an effect.  For some people it drives them nuts, others can shrug it off. To those who struggle with watching a bad game(s) I say try to distance yourselves a bit from the game. Try to see the talent in each play (even when it's a score on your team), it helps one to appreciate the sport which is more important than the team.  I love Hockey. I love the Kings. People can ""hate"" on my team all they want. In some ways I like it, the intense rivalries set a great backdrop for a game. Is there any better moment that seeing the Kings defeat a rival in a close game as the final minutes of the 3rd period wind down? Those are some of the best games because they draw us in and make us feel like we're apart of some great shared experience, which in many ways is exactly what is happening.  Keep loving Hockey Ducks Kings bro.  Edit: formating"
losangeleskings,2zqbhk,EinsamWulf,4,Fri Mar 20 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"Knowledge is the worlds greatest weapon. I don't remember what his name was, but it's a quote from the Billabong Odyssey. He said ""Fear is a lack of experience and knowledge. If you gain the experience and take what you've learned from it and what you already knew, fear is removed"". The more you know about your haters, the less you fear them. Just like your mom told you in grade school ""your bullies are mean to you because they're jealous. Because you're handsome and smart and people like you and they wish they had that"". Mother knows best, because I'm one handsome bastard.  I think you're right. It's hard to be a fan and just let it ride. To be helpless and to know you can't do anything more than you're already doing fucking suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks. Especially when you keep losing. The last few years of playoffs have been fucking hard on me. I was at each game 7. Each game 7 we lost. To sit there knowing you can't help sucks. Some people turn to rage, some people get depressed, some people can't even process what they're feeling. Different strokes for different folks.  Hockey is hockey is hockey. It's the toughest sport for a reason. It's not for the faint of heart or the weak of faith. We act the way we do because we love the sport and we love how it makes us feel.

losangeleskings,2zqbhk,Yogi_the_duck,2,Fri Mar 20 22:25:57 2015 UTC,Hockey is hockey is hockey. It's the toughest sport for a reason.   Very true. There is a mental toughness component to the game that is absolutely crucial. You let the other team get in your head and suddenly a 2 goal lead can end up a 3 goal deficit. It's a game that can change in a matter of seconds based on the momentum of the game.   If there is one thing that holds true is that our love of the game and our teams is what bonds us together. I'm glad to have you hanging out with us in this sub.   I'm very proud to be able to share that experience with you King bro.   Likewise dude

losangeleskings,2zqbhk,Yogi_the_duck,3,Sun Mar 22 04:22:41 2015 UTC,"Yogi, I have a question for you about the Ponda, and, specifically, the Kings visiting..  I was there Wed night....great game...plenty of LA Kings fans, but plenty of YOUR fans too (it was either YOUR or Sux....i went for the nicer)  I noticed that at each stoppage, and for when the rink hosts had camera time, they were bashing on LA Kings and their fans NON-STOP.  EVERY SINGLE STOPPAGE.  EVERY VIDEO MONTAGE.  Do they do this for each opponent?  Is this some special treatment for LA Kings fans?  I found it really quite juvenile and tired after the first 15min of the game...  We get it....we're rivals.  Yes, we get that you think we know nothing about the sport....yes, when the fake proposal between a YOURTEAM fan and an LA KINGS fan, resulted in the female YOURTEAM fan running away gesturing at the jersey as her reason...yeah, it was funny-ish  Do you do this for the Sharks?  The Red Wings?  And fellow LA KINGS fans....I've yet to make it to Staples for a Kings/THATTEAM matchup....do we badger them this bad?"
losangeleskings,2zqbhk,sandypheet,6,Fri Mar 20 20:33:06 2015 UTC,"Good question sandy,  The answer is no. The Ducks don't do that for any other team besides LA, and quite honestly its annoying that we don't. I think the rivalry between our two teams is good and that the heart of it but I think both sides cross the line sometimes.   Do they do this for each opponent? Is this some special treatment for LA Kings fans? I found it really quite juvenile and tired after the first 15min of the game...   I've been to Ducks Kings games in LA and I always thought that there was a tilt in the insults. Granted, I was never on the other side; but theres Bailey with the dead duck on the line, the videos that the Staples media guys do (Duck season if anyone remembers that one, back and forth between a ducks and kings fan for fans too boo and cheer for, and the cartman stuff). I didn't like it either, but I realized I was not in friendly territory. Your barn, your rules. If I don't like it, I don't have to be there. So you suck it up and deal with it.   We get it....we're rivals. Yes, we get that you think we know nothing about the sport....yes, when the fake proposal between a YOURTEAM fan and an LA KINGS fan, resulted in the female YOURTEAM fan running away gesturing at the jersey as her reason...yeah, it was funny-ish   I think that our media guys are simply firing back. Granted, I didn't like showing guys on the screen and comparing them to troll and smeagol. That's not cool, attack a fan base, but don't single anyone out.    Do you do this for the Sharks? The Red Wings?   Nope. Not that I've seen.  Idk what to tell you man. I think it's one of those things where ""let he without sin cast the first stone"". Your media team is top notch at what they do and I love their creativity and their ability to hype your fans and make them cheer harder for their squad while cheering harder against the other team. But I believe if I were thin skinned I could take what they do the wrong way and get offended.   Yes, we get that you think we know nothing about the sport....   Hey! You can't complain about that! That's our thing to complain about you thinking about us! /s  Let's be honest. 100% down to earth honest. More than half of the people who ""participate"" in this rivalry don't know jack shit about the team they cheer for let alone hockey in general. I talked to the guy next to me the other night (Kings fan) and tried to ask him about the new players this year, where Stoll was, what happened to him, and how the Kings are coping without. He had absolutely no information to give me at all, but he was pretty adamant that the Kings would win. Case in point, he doesn't know shit about hockey or his team, he's there to support. Another guy in 419 wearing a Ducks jersey who would NOT SHUT THE FUCK UP was in the same camp, just wearing a different jersey. Literally added nothing to our conversation except drunken insults hurled at the Kings and their fans. Honestly, get the fuck out of my face and take that jersey off. You don't deserve to have that crest on your chest if you're going to act like a jack ass. You make everyone else look bad."
losangeleskings,2zqbhk,Yogi_the_duck,0,Fri Mar 20 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"As far as the Stapler goes, the only in-game video packages they use against the Ducks are the Cartman videos, but there are multiple ones for several teams, so it's not just for the Ducks. Also, it's up maybe two or three times during the game.    Oh, I forgot about Bailey. Sometimes Bailey comes out in hunter garb holding a stuffed duck toy.  I gotta say, that video package that the Ponda has that looks like it was done in MS Paint or a very early Flash animation, the one with the piano or anvil falling onto a Kings fan is kinda embarrassing.    Also, when they pick out a Ducks shill wearing a Kings jersey on the screen and ask, ""Who is this King?"" and the photo they show is a trading card from the 1970s-era Kings and the shill they pull doesn't get it. ""How did you not know that is Rogie Vachon? You call yourself a Kings fan?"" or ""How do you not know Kings legend Bob Pulford?"" It's slightly irritating.    But, I guess, it's doing the job."
losangeleskings,2zqbhk,DamnRandall,0,Fri Mar 20 20:50:57 2015 UTC,Staples doesn't do that beyond cartman.  I went to the February game at Ponda with a Ducks fan friend. He was kind of embarrassed.  Ducks fans themselves were chill though.

The pride in winning the cup is obsessive too, I watch a broadcast of kings and every time they go to commercial its about winning the cup, like get over yourself. The kings feels like a cult of fans that just found out what hockey is in 2012 and bought there new jersey and go to the la live scene and never criticize their own team at all. You go to any other nhl subreddit team people are talking about trades and who sucked in last nights game while here its jus omg look at how great kings are, look at quicks amazing save that was completely preventable and then cry about whenever someone touches him."

Meaning they know the areas they lack and improve upon them in the regular season during practice and employ a completely new game plan in the playoffs? It seems like the last few seasons the play has shifted dramatically in style, game plan, and execution once the playoffs hit. I feel like Sutter experiments during the regular season to find out what works and then employs a particular game plan throughout the playoffs and sticks to it. Just a thought. Maybe Kopitar knows what to fix, but they don't want to tip their hand just yet.   I could also be making up elaborate ruses in my head..."

losangeleskings,2znegd,cowmix88,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:28:19 2015 UTC,Depends on the Kings payment plan he chooses. There's either all up front. 2 payments (one in June and one in August) or monthly payments (I think it's 10 monthly payments).  Also I guess it's whatever agreement you make with him. If you're going in half then I guess he'd be fine with those payments above (depending on which he chooses). But if you're buying like 5 tickets I'd assume he'd want the money sooner than later.
losangeleskings,2znegd,cowmix88,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"I might be interested.  I'm in line to buy season tickets, but I will pass next season if I can't get the ones I want. In that case, I can buy from you."

losangeleskings,2znc5q,LAKingBob,12,Fri Mar 20 00:34:33 2015 UTC,"Hello, sorry I'm a little late, I had to say a few Goodbyes to my old pals with the Avs, but I'm finally at the Edmonton Airport flying to New York to be with my Kings. (Reality, I was at work and couldnt say my introduction until I got home 30 Minutes ago.)  I wanna say it feels fucking great to be a King. The Kings were my dream team that I wanted to join when I heard about The user draft a few weeks back. It was a long day but when I heard about the Trade between the Avs (me) and Kings (/u/Nicklasav) it was a joyous occasion. I can't wait to join the Kings GDT tomorrow against the Islanders.   A little bit about myself. I'm a Half Japanese from Nebraska (Omaha area), and liked the Kings for a few years now. I've seen the Kings in person 3 times now, 1 in Colorado against the Avs and 2 games at Staples with the Most recent one in November against the Canes. The most recent one was when I sent an invite on here for an impromptu Reddit meetup and got to meet /u/wiseaus_stunt_double and /u/Destillat and they were fucking awesome. My favorite player is Quick and I already own his Jersey which I got in November. I really want to move out to Los Angeles in a couple years so that's why I put the Kings as my top destination for the draft/trade.   I wanna thank /u/heyitsEnricoPallazzo, /u/LAKingBob, and /u/Pen2Paper on the Kings and /u/AvsJoe for facilitating this trade, also wanna thank /u/Nicklasav for being a willing trade partner in this. Lastly my family and friends. I'm going to miss the people on the Avs, but I'll make new friends with the Kings. Can't fucking wait.  GKG!!!"

We were learning about the revolutionary war and I saw the Pats playing and thought it was cool they were named after those who fought for our freedom. I grew up an hour north of Philly and 4 years later they played the Eagles in the superbowl on my birthday, Pats won and cemented my fandom.   My boyfriend is a die hard Steelers fan and has tried to stamp it out of me over the past 5 years, and I thought he did. Them letting go my favorite player ever, Welker didn't help, I was pissed and stopped watching for a year or two. But watching them win the superbowl this year brought back the happiness I had when I was a kid and they beat my family's team.   I wasn't exposed to hockey until I came to Pittsburgh in the fall of 2009, my new best friend, now boyfriend, is a huge pens fan and we went to a game and I never looked back.   So yeah, I grew up in the Philly area and I'm a Pats and Pens fan. I get heckled all the time when I go home, hahaha."

I think I've seen you around /r/nfl and I hate the Patriots something fierce, but the fans on Reddit, individually, are pretty cool.

losangeleskings,2zltrr,BagelzAllDay,24,Thu Mar 19 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"How much cleaner can the hit be? Brown uses his shoulder to go through the center body mass of Perry. Hits him dead square in the center of the chest portion of his shoulder pads. And Brown gets a penalty because all the other ducks reacted to their star getting hit hard? Clean hits should NOT be penalized, and when a team takes exception to a clean hit, the referees need to keep control of the game and send a message to the team that reacted in a ludicrous way to a hard, clean hit.   Don't get me started on the missed interference call on that directly resulted in the scoring chance (and goal) for Kesler in OT. It looked like a basketball screen and roll, and the refs seemed to forget which sport they were watching."
losangeleskings,2zltrr,banksy_,5,Thu Mar 19 17:54:25 2015 UTC,"Total agreement. This play was fucking infuriating and it felt like there was no shortage of bad calls in the game. How Brown got called on this is beyond me. I feel like there should be additional penalties for ""retaliating"" against clean hits. I'm for fights in hockey and you gotta stick up for your teammates, but going after someone for a hard, clean hit isn't how I want the game to be played.  I didn't catch the missed interference call that resulted in the OT goal. If there's a link, I'd love to see it."
losangeleskings,2zltrr,afacelikeprisonbread,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:41:04 2015 UTC,"If the situation warrants 2 full minutes of 5 on 3, then award it! Don't swallow your god damn whistle.   OT Goal  As soon as Kesler picks up the puck behind the net, it looks like Lindholm is floating towards the area where he picks Doughty. He took at least 2 hard strides as soon as he saw the Kesler wanted to come from behind the goal and ran right into Doughty. Idk what this looked like to the refs, but it was a blatant pick play to me as soon as I saw it."
losangeleskings,2zltrr,banksy_,2,Fri Mar 20 15:43:01 2015 UTC,The ref put his whistle in his mouth as if he was gonna call it then went ah fuck it.
losangeleskings,2zltrr,BW4LL,14,Thu Mar 19 22:37:14 2015 UTC,"Dustin Brown destroying Corey Perry, drawing a penalty in the process leading to a power play goal by Jeff Carter assisted by Anze Kopitar and Drew Doughty is pretty much my ideal hockey scenario."
losangeleskings,2zltrr,Nicklasav,5,Thu Mar 19 19:35:31 2015 UTC,Would have been even more ideal if our defense could do its job during OT :(
losangeleskings,2zltrr,Yogi_the_duck,15,Thu Mar 19 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"Such bullshit that there's a call on that. Clean hit any way you look at it. Perry had his head down and he rightfully paid for it. That's the Brown I miss. Fuckin' rough and tumble, down and dirty, grinding it out with no teeth and the facial hair of a 15 year old."
losangeleskings,2zltrr,pbjamm,10,Thu Mar 19 17:52:45 2015 UTC,Calling a Rough on Brown was totally because the refs were uncomfortable giving the Kings a 2min 5 on 3.  Dupres and Stoner were both going to the box so they had to even it up a bit.
losangeleskings,2zltrr,Yogi_the_duck,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:12:37 2015 UTC,So you think it was damage control? Keeping the game from getting out of hand physcially?
losangeleskings,2zltrr,pbjamm,5,Thu Mar 19 18:54:56 2015 UTC,I dont really know.  I think it was a very poor call on its face as the hit was 100% clean and Brown did not retaliate against anyone roughing him up.  It could have been to put a stop to potential targeting of Brown but I think it was more likely the refs not being comfortable giving the Kings a 5 on 3 for 2 full minutes.
losangeleskings,2zltrr,LOUD__NOISES,8,Thu Mar 19 19:29:26 2015 UTC,"Refs botched it. Putting Brown in the box was a total pussy call. If a situation mandates a 5 on 3, give a fucking 5 on 3."
losangeleskings,2zltrr,Zanchbot,3,Thu Mar 19 20:28:47 2015 UTC,"The hit was awesome and clean, but the roughing call on Brown for the ensuing scrum was pretty stupid. At least we scored on that power play."
losangeleskings,2zltrr,davidprevails,3,Thu Mar 19 19:25:30 2015 UTC,"Off topic, but its nice to see Brown have a trendy cut. Just cause you're 30 and have a school in your backyard doesn't mean you can't be hip and happening."

He now sits at the right hand of Martinez; From there He shall come to lead His fans and disciples once more. We believe in Holy Toffoli, The system of Darryl Sutter, The communion of Kings players, past and present, The forgiveness of Muzzin, And the return of the Cup to Los Angeles once more. Amen.   Now, as a newly christened Kings fan, you must prepare to accept the following:   If there is an inopportune time to take an offensive zone penalty, Stoll will take it.  If a defensive breakdown leads to a goal, Jake #HotMuzz Muzzin will take all the blame regardless of his all-powerful eyebrows It is a known fact that Dwight King takes pleasure in devouring souls.

losangeleskings,2zlwgl,RichieCski,13,Fri Mar 20 05:09:59 2015 UTC,"Martinez loves jazz.  Kopitar has a thing for racoons and Jesus.  Gabo has a stable of ice skating horses.  Voynov hopefully doesn't like hitting wives.  McNabb is, in fact, a McNugget in disguise.  Muzzin is, in fact, Wolverine.  King hates smiles.  Greene can't tell a joke to save his puck--er life.  Regehr's nickname is Nancy Kerrigan 2.0..  Brown is known for his clean and fair play by the rest of the league.  Carter is too pretty.  Quick's last name is actually Slow and he is totally not elite.  Sutter prefers to keep lines intact and praise rookies on their play--oh and he also likes to pull goalies super early.  Williams has a fetish for game sevens.  Toffoli is holier than the pope--praise be unto him.  Never Doughty Doughty.  Bob could get more pussy than Rosie O'Donnel if he wanted.  Bailey conquered Twitter.  This is all I can think of at the top of my head, I am sure others can add more to the list."

Or because he has pet raccoons and loves the bible?  I'm terrified of horses.  Yeah, no one should hit wives.  McNabb/McNugget - checks out  Muzzin = Muzzy? Why is King so upset?  He won the Lady Byng trophy like 6 times right?  Carter...  Juan Rapido if you hablo espanol  Sutter did say John Gibson (a rookie) was the best goalie he'd ever seen, so that checks out.  Williams... He's pretty tiny...  Woah, does that mean he gets a cool hat too?!  Never ever Doughty Doughty?  Bob? (stupid question :/)  Ok, so from what I understand Bailey is a girls name.

Sometimes it's that 70s line. Sometimes Carter and Toffoli are out there with someone new. Sometimes Brown is out with Kopitar and Gaborik. Other times he's out with Shore/Stoll and Williams.  Every coach will juggle his lines, but Sutter will almost leave you guessing from game to game. It's hard to keep a solid memory of who is going to be where; he seems to just go with what makes sense to him. Sometimes it works (either iteration of that 70s line) other times it won't (Clifford, Shore, Williams)."
losangeleskings,2zlwgl,GaboKopiBrown,4,Thu Mar 19 18:28:09 2015 UTC,Sutter has like 2098340923840923 line combinations he likes to use.   The old Terry Murray manoeuver.
losangeleskings,2zlwgl,CrispyLardon,2,Thu Mar 19 18:36:38 2015 UTC,"that 70s line is Pearson, Toffoli and Carter right?  Are there guys who, no matter what, play together?"
losangeleskings,2zlwgl,Destillat,3,Thu Mar 19 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"Kopi and Gabo always together, and Carts and Toff always together, and most of the time Quick and his unbroken stick are together.  The original 70's line was Toff, Pearson, Carts. But was recently brought back with King on the line instead of Pearson--pretty much anyone in the 70's at this point paired with Toff and Carts."
losangeleskings,2zlwgl,GaboKopiBrown,2,Thu Mar 19 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"Quick and his unbroken stick   Classic.  Ok cool!   What, in your eyes, was that move made for? Why swap King and Pearson?"
losangeleskings,2zlwgl,krucz36,4,Thu Mar 19 19:06:39 2015 UTC,"Pearson broke his leg, been out for a couple months. But even before that Sutter broke up the line because they stopped providing results. Sutter seems to have a short expiration date if player/players are not performing, he moves them around or shortens their minutes. It's his way of saying do better."
losangeleskings,2zlwgl,GaboKopiBrown,2,Thu Mar 19 19:15:06 2015 UTC,I think Sutter tries so many different lines and then uses what he remembers in the playoffs to make things work if nothing is.  Sure as hell worked last year.

With Pearson's injury, King (#74) is playing on that line more often than not and so they've been dubbed That 70s line 2.0, duex, part two, take your pick.  Since Gaborik joined the team I can't think of many (or any) situations where he and Kopitar have been split. I also don't think Toffoli and Carter have been separated since last year's playoffs but there might have been times in the middle of the season I'm forgetting about."

losangeleskings,2zmhqb,surferboy736,5,Thu Mar 19 20:35:56 2015 UTC,Nice list. I would throw in the 2001 comeback against the Red Wings was pretty great too over Brown being named captain
losangeleskings,2zmhqb,RichieCski,3,Thu Mar 19 22:49:46 2015 UTC,The Frenzy on Figueroa is what kept me going through the dark years. I wore out the VHS tape I had that recorded on.
losangeleskings,2zmhqb,DamnRandall,2,Thu Mar 19 23:13:38 2015 UTC,"^ I was going to suggest this. That 2001 series was the brightest moment in a very dark time for us Kings fans. Look at Detroit's roster that year, they were fucking stacked. And somehow we beat them. Awesome moment. Then we took Roy & the Avalanche to game 7.  I'd also find a way to fit Game 7 vs Toronto on the list."
losangeleskings,2zmhqb,bryan_sensei,3,Fri Mar 20 07:26:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the Kings were an afterthought in 2012. They were the team no one really wanted to face, and lots of people said so. They  were fighting for a division title to the last game of the season. They got an eighth seed because things were so freaking tight. The Coyotes, Sharks, and Kings were within two points of each other in the pacific.   Two of the three lowest-point-total teams in the west faced off to go to the SCF too."
losangeleskings,2zlqx9,Zanchbot,7,Thu Mar 19 17:14:42 2015 UTC,I want to see a Richards/Cliffy/Nolan line. Maybe playing with the mean line will bring Richards' physicality back.
losangeleskings,2zlqx9,KingsfanMDJ,7,Thu Mar 19 18:06:59 2015 UTC,Am I crazy or wasn't that the exact line he was playing on when they sent him down?
losangeleskings,2zlqx9,doot_doot,3,Thu Mar 19 20:29:46 2015 UTC,He was on a whole bunch of different line combinations. But I think the way Nolan and Cliffy have stepped up as of late it'd be an interesting combo.
losangeleskings,2zlqx9,KingsfanMDJ,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"That's where he was most of last season and for a good chunk of this season. But I agree, with Cliffy and Nolan making huge strides in their offensive work, they might benefit from his playmaking."
losangeleskings,2zlqx9,doot_doot,5,Thu Mar 19 20:41:00 2015 UTC,yes. we won't make the playoffs if stoll is out much longer. Stoll isn't good but andreoff isn't ready yet for this level of play. Sutter should've got him into more games earlier in the season
losangeleskings,2zlqx9,thegetawayplan9,6,Thu Mar 19 18:46:01 2015 UTC,"I miss Richards offense, but Shore is definitely playing better than Richards defensively. Shore needs to get his first out of the way and I feel like his scoring will pick up. I think ditching Andreoff and having Richie and Williams on a line with Shore at center could work and then having a regular 4th line would be beneficial."
losangeleskings,2zlqx9,dalbtraps,3,Thu Mar 19 17:20:16 2015 UTC,It'd sure be nice to see # 10 out there again.  On a side note Stoll has the same amount of points ( 6 G 9 A 67 GP) as Richie had when he was sent down but he's played almost 20 games more I think. I know he makes something like 2.5 mil less but come on! Hopefully he gets called up sooner than later.
losangeleskings,2zlqx9,ler888,3,Thu Mar 19 19:34:27 2015 UTC,Richards took way fewer penalties too. Lately Stoll has seemed like a penalty factory.
losangeleskings,2zlqx9,doot_doot,2,Thu Mar 19 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"I'm really looking forward to it. I did not agree with the decision to send him down to begin with, seeing as how Stoll has had a terrible season. If Stoll is out for any length of time, I am excited to see our center corps which, IMO, we will have next year. Kopitar-Carter-Richards-Shore. Shore makes Clifford and Nolan much better and Richards certainly plays better than Stoll. Plus, we get Richards back for Penalty Killing, which could let Kopitar focus primarily on 5v5 and PP."
losangeleskings,2zlqx9,BlueApple10,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:02:35 2015 UTC,"I think we'd bring him up for playoffs, and let him play, where he'll do good enough to raise his trade value, and over the offseason DL will trade him, his contract is just too bad to keep him"

losangeleskings,2zk18y,RubyRhod,4,Thu Mar 19 09:45:24 2015 UTC,"Why was he sent down? He doesn't seem like a guy who should be playing in the AHL. I remember he was demoted to the 4th line, but was he playing that poorly?"
losangeleskings,2zk18y,GaboKopiBrown,4,Thu Mar 19 07:27:52 2015 UTC,"I personally think it was a reality check. We have 5 more years of him and he needs to dedicate himself in ways he wasn't before. He was just in LA for over a week getting evaluated for conditioning/training with a focus on diet/nutrition (which apparently is a bigger problem that previously thought).   He'll probably get called back up for the playoffs, but I don't think he'll play much barring any injuries."
losangeleskings,2zk18y,KingsfanMDJ,3,Thu Mar 19 16:00:53 2015 UTC,I really hope it's conditioning and diet. Those are solvable.

losangeleskings,2zk18y,Just_a_Gamer,5,Thu Mar 19 06:10:06 2015 UTC,GG Kings see you guys in the playoffs
losangeleskings,2zk18y,lordjedediah,3,Thu Mar 19 07:23:11 2015 UTC,fingers crossed.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,kiwirish,6,Thu Mar 19 16:04:38 2015 UTC,"Remember when we didn't play like utter dog shit against Anaheim in the 3rd period? ME EITHER!   If we make the playoffs, we better not get into many overtime games, because our asses will be going home real fast."
losangeleskings,2zk18y,Just_a_Gamer,5,Thu Mar 19 05:18:06 2015 UTC,4v4 OT is pretty different than 5v5.  Clearly this team decided they didn't need to practice 4v4.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,lordjedediah,3,Thu Mar 19 05:19:58 2015 UTC,"OT is fine, we'll be able to play 5 on 5 in the playoffs."
losangeleskings,2zk18y,Rando_Thoughtful,4,Thu Mar 19 05:20:40 2015 UTC,I don't trust this team after 60 minutes.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,TheRealDrCube,2,Thu Mar 19 05:22:12 2015 UTC,*40 minutes.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,nessman930,1 point,Thu Mar 19 05:33:11 2015 UTC,It's so frustrating because last (late) season the Kings DOMINATED the third period. And then in 2012 they scored all kinds of crazy 4v4 and shorthanded goals. They change every year!
losangeleskings,2zk18y,leftylogan,5,Thu Mar 19 09:43:17 2015 UTC,Ugh... the 3rd period has not been our friend...
losangeleskings,2zk18y,TheEw0kGamer,5,Thu Mar 19 05:18:37 2015 UTC,I'll take the point but that was the worst miscommunication I have ever seen in a 4 on 4.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,wiseaus_stunt_double,5,Thu Mar 19 05:18:33 2015 UTC,Ducks are built for a team to take advantage of all the room (IMO). Knew we were in trouble as soon as it went to OT.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,TheEw0kGamer,5,Thu Mar 19 05:19:06 2015 UTC,/u/wiseaus_stunt_double Hath cursed us! Burn the heretic I tell ya! Whhhhhhhyyyyy... ;_; Kesler is literally Patrick Fucking Kane to us. He just always gets his shit on against this team.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,wiseaus_stunt_double,6,Thu Mar 19 05:23:15 2015 UTC,You had to trade me to the Ducks!  This is why you never trade within the division.    I'll make it up to you guys when I reclaim my crown.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,_Taengoo_,2,Thu Mar 19 05:27:17 2015 UTC,You didn't have to mention his name though. Everyone knows some spooky voodoo shit happens when that happens.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,RubyRhod,2,Thu Mar 19 05:29:16 2015 UTC,I thought it was the opposite.  At least that's what happens w/ Bob.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,kiwirish,3,Thu Mar 19 05:36:52 2015 UTC,"Why Regehr plays in OT I'll never know. It wasn't directly his fault we lost, but we won the opening faceoff and he felt pressured and just gave it right to the Ducks which led to them entering the zone and scoring.  Sekera/McNabb has been the best D pairing by far the past few games. They're very mobile and composed with the puck, which is perfect for OT."
losangeleskings,2zk18y,glovebox360,1 point,Thu Mar 19 05:29:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't get it. As soon as I saw him on the ice for the faceoff, I knew we were losing. Someone should go through all our OT losses and see how much he was on ice for them."
losangeleskings,2zk18y,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,8,Thu Mar 19 16:04:06 2015 UTC,"God I hate Ryan Kesler. What a fuckstick.  On the bright side, we got a point and I loved how we looked under pressure. We were really good in that last bit of the 3rd period and were unlucky not to score. We just need that intensity more often."
losangeleskings,2zk18y,lordjedediah,5,Thu Mar 19 05:20:11 2015 UTC,"Damn, Nick Shore is really filling in for Stoll nicely..."
losangeleskings,2zk18y,BiohazardPixie,4,Thu Mar 19 05:26:29 2015 UTC,Who else is going to take the offense zone penalties
losangeleskings,2zk18y,ToastedFireBomb,2,Thu Mar 19 05:32:22 2015 UTC,And not score.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,krucz36,2,Thu Mar 19 05:33:42 2015 UTC,"He's young, and to be fair, not all of them can be Pearson or Toffoli's. I'd like to see him play consistent shifts with Carter for example, see where that gets him, but it isn't really realistic."
losangeleskings,2zk18y,Shinobi801,1 point,Thu Mar 19 05:39:36 2015 UTC,"True, we don't want our PK to get rusty, now do we? Obviously our red hot PK is due to all the practice ;)"
losangeleskings,2zk18y,Butt_Farrt,2,Thu Mar 19 05:34:37 2015 UTC,"The point is great, but watching the ducks outskate a lot of our d-men was difficult. the kings looked SLOW for much of the game... Brownie seemed to be operating at full speed though."
losangeleskings,2zk18y,lakingscrzy,4,Thu Mar 19 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"We lost to the Ducks... Again...  But we still got the point. Meaning the tiebreaker won't go to the Flames. Suck it Flames.  Also, why the hell can't we beat the damn Ducks this season? Fuck Kesler."
losangeleskings,2zk18y,lordjedediah,4,Thu Mar 19 05:20:37 2015 UTC,Tie breaker still goes to the flames... This way the flames need at least a point to get back into third. The point definitely helps though!
losangeleskings,2zk18y,gambit700,1 point,Thu Mar 19 05:24:05 2015 UTC,Because the ducks are good during the season. Which doesn't affect us because we are the postseason team. We just need to get there.

losangeleskings,2zk18y,CrispyLardon,4,Thu Mar 19 05:17:20 2015 UTC,Well...fuck
losangeleskings,2zk18y,ZoilaBell,2,Thu Mar 19 05:17:37 2015 UTC,Not the way we wanted to ended it but much better than it could have been..
losangeleskings,2zk18y,BW4LL,3,Thu Mar 19 05:19:51 2015 UTC,It's like no one but Kopi wanted to play in the 3rd.  We really need Marty and Tanner back--and probably even Mike.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,ToastedFireBomb,4,Thu Mar 19 05:21:06 2015 UTC,I am so mad. I can't believe this. Ugh.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,wizardmami,3,Thu Mar 19 05:21:09 2015 UTC,Bit of a pick by silfverberg and looked like the ref was gonna call it but didn't. Still the big guns need to come to play and help Quick out and they didn't. Ducks big boys came to play and that's why they've won almost all the games against us. Especially Kesler as much as I hate him.
losangeleskings,2zk18y,TheNickster,3,Thu Mar 19 05:24:27 2015 UTC,"Getting pretty goddamn tired of our inconsistent and frankly skimpy offense. We need to start scoring more, especially guys like brown and kopi and even toffoli. Don't get me wrong, kopi had a great game tonight, but our big guns seriously need to start scoring. I know they seem to turn it on in playoffs, but we need to get to playoffs first. One point is huge, yes, obviously, but damn our OT is fucking sad. We seem to always leave one guy wide fucking open in the high slot. Every goddamn time. And when that guy happens to be Ryan fucking Kesler you know you're in trouble. I don't trust calgary to lose or tank or go away. It would be nice if they did, but I think they are seriously dangerous, and I think they are going to win a LOT of the last few games, and we need to keep up. Saturday will be huge, we have to beat the canucks. Quick was on it again, really solid outing for him tonight. Carter has been on a  consistent scoring clip and that's awesome to see. Losing to the ducks is just so goddamn annoying. that stupid corey perry and his stupid face.... my all ducks fan journalism class is going to suck come monday >.>"
losangeleskings,2zk18y,cfox109,2,Thu Mar 19 05:33:20 2015 UTC,Thanks Obama...

losangeleskings,2zj4so,_Taengoo_,3,Thu Mar 19 03:04:24 2015 UTC,I assumed it was due to the scuffle after the hit because the hit was clean and shouldn't have warranted a penalty imo.

losangeleskings,2zjlat,puckpuckgo,2,Thu Mar 19 06:10:17 2015 UTC,I was there also last night with a good buddy. There were a ton of Kings fans that made the game. GKG chants at times overpowered the home fans. What I did notice is that Anaheim definitely has an inferiority complex. Every clip on the big screen had to do with King bashing. All in good fun but it seemed a little over the top. Felt a little classless. Never seen it done to that level at Staples. Place erupted when Williams tied it up though. Glad to at least get a point. GKG!

Instead of three divisions in each conference there are now just two, which resulted in new playoff seeding. The top three teams in each division (6teams) are in for playoffs regardless of record. After that, there are two wildcard spots. These spots are filled by the best team regardless of division so there could be the 3 playoff teams from Pacific division but 5 from the central with the 2 wildcards.  PACIFIC   1-seed 2-seed  3-seed   CENTRAL   1-seed 2-seed  3-seed   WILDCARD   [Wildcard 1] [Wildcard 2]   There is no 4th seed. The top seed in the conference plays the bottom wildcard, the other division winner plays the 1st wildcard. The 2-3 seeds play each other.   Hope that makes sense."

losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,15,Wed Mar 18 14:45:36 2015 UTC,The story of Saint Martinez the Infallible actually goes back to at least the early 2013-14 regular season.  Stories of his miracles began to spread and the prophecy fulfilled itself with the OT GWGs in both the WCF and SCF.  After that it was basically solidified that Saint Martinez has his place among the gods.

losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,2,Wed Mar 18 15:27:07 2015 UTC,"if the LA Store comped you one jersey of any active player, whom would it be and why?"
losangeleskings,2zfp66,sandypheet,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:32:32 2015 UTC,"That's a great question!   I am a huge Quick fan. As a new goalie myself, Quick's incredible play and aggressive style are things that I try to emulate on a regular basis. That old school pillow stack poke check, the rolling glove save, or even just his ability to move post to post especially when he leads with his blocker and just seems to make saves that leave me awestruck are just 3 of the many reasons why I like his style and play. Also, he's a quiet guy that knows when to flip the switch to captain insane-o mode. I'm quiet on the rink but when it gets intense I turn into a loud mouth and a bit of a hot head who isn't afraid to dish out a few waffleboards to players who like to take liberties, just like Quicky.  Also, I have an affinity for Kopitar's abilities. I think there is a giant bias in awards given to the East and having players in non-traditional markets left in the corner. Kopitar is top 3 in 2 way centers. I don't like giving specific numbers because it leaves too much to each person's interpretation of what makes someone ""good"" (play, stats, adv. stats, intangibles). But I think he's a killer on both ends of the ice and strictly from a fan of the game he's amazing to watch.  So it would have to be between the two of them!"
losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,3,Wed Mar 18 17:12:00 2015 UTC,Can we keep you forever?
losangeleskings,2zfp66,LAKingBob,7,Wed Mar 18 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"I've said this a million times, and most of all inside conversations that relate to the LA/ANA rivalry: I am a hockey fan before I am a Ducks fan. I love the game. I love the precision it takes to float a saucer pass from left to right wing and the hand eye coordination and power it takes to rip a one timer from one knee top shelf to beat (in any game) one of the most elite goalies in the world. I love the feeling I get when I walk up to any arena, professional, semi-pro, or even my local rink, for a game. That pit in your stomach that grows and grows in anticipation knowing that as soon as you walk through those doors it's fucking game time. I love being able to sit down with my fellow fans and have conversations on every topic the game holds. I love the highs and lows that this sport brings. The ultimate level of happiness seeing your team take the ice when the last goal of a series is scored or the time runs out and you can barely hear yourself think over the monstrous noise of thousands of other people yelling and screaming the same way you are. That feeling of ultimate sadness when you watch your team completely crumble and fall apart in front of your eyes and wonder ""why"" as the other side takes the ice to celebrate. I love the feeling I get when I put on my skates and head towards the rink; knowing that I am about to participate in what I consider the greatest display of coordination, timing, strength, conditioning, emotion, and competition.   I am a hockey fan. I am in love with this sport. This is black and white. To break it down into ""us versus them"" and ""you like them so you can't like us"" fucking childhood playground, bloods versus crips, sunni shia shit show is stupid and I won't play into it. So can you keep me forever? Do the Kings play hockey? Does a bear shit in the woods?  Of course."
losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,2,Wed Mar 18 21:46:16 2015 UTC,Right now I'd say it's more based on his GWG since he's been out for over a month due to a concussion. Hopefully we get him back soon.

I want to thank my good friend /u/Pen2Paper for this blockbuster trade. I haven't followed wiseaus but he seems to be unanimously loved and I can only hope to be able to fill those shoes over time.   Pen is right.

losangeleskings,2zfp66,heyitsEnricoPallazzo,3,Wed Mar 18 18:17:05 2015 UTC,"Ice - Westminster Ice, Anaheim Ice (AKA DISNEY ICE SON), KHS Ice (pick up only)  Roller - Irvine Inline (AKA 949 Center, AKA Gretzky Center), The Rinks HB (AKA Coast 2 Coast)  I've played every position including goalie. But mainly I play RW. I'm 6'6"" 200lbs so I make a pretty sweet screen and I'm pretty difficult to move. I also don't take shit on the rink and I don't let anyone take liberties with my players or goalies. I've got the scars and stories (usually told with a big, disappointed sigh from my mother when asked) to prove it.   My favorite was in high school roller. We were playing a rival team so everyone came out. We had probably 60 or so people in the stands including my then girlfriend. I came out early in the first on a nice stretch pass for a 2 on 1 down the right side, faded inward looking at my partner like I was going to pass and ripped one top shelf short side. Skated over and pointed at my girlfriend while the crowd went ape shit. I made it back to the bench and my buddy who was our assistant coach smacked me on the head and told me that ""goals are for the boys, fights are for the broads. You don't give her that goal, you give it to your team. Now go get one for the boys"". Midway through the second I'm down low screening the goalie on a PP and put away some loose change for my second goal of the night and I point at the bench as if to say ""for the boys"". I got back on the bench and proceeded to get smacked again by my friend. ""That's one for the boys and one for the broads. Does that seem fair to you? Is she out there skating her ass off? No. So she doesn't deserve the same as the boys. You better get one more for the boys"". Late in the third tied 4-4 and I strip a defenseman and charge down the rink on the break away. Now, I'm a big dude with a heart of gold, fists like bricks, and balls of steel, but my mitts sure as shit aren't made of silk. So I make this ridiculous set of moves that put me way too far out to the right of the net and I couldn't even get a shot off. I look like a fucking moron. Out of frustration, I rip one towards the goalie so that my try isn't in vain, and low and behold I shoot thru the 7 hole and it trickles into the net for my first hat trick, 4 years into my highschool career, for the 2nd goal of the night for the boys, and the eventual game winner. That goal was the biggest monkey off my back. I went to a huge school that circled around basketball and football, but the next day a good number of people said they heard about the goals and said they'd come watch next game. They didn't, but it was still cool to get some recognition for winning a game in a sport that most people didn't even know we had a team for."

losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,7,Wed Mar 18 15:14:09 2015 UTC,"a Ducks fan who is meh at best about Brian Hayward   There is hope in this one. A faint candle in the darkness.  BTW, we expect strong representation in the GDT tonight."
losangeleskings,2zfp66,anexanhume,3,Wed Mar 18 15:18:50 2015 UTC,"I've met the guy in person a few times. I won a contest with the Ducks last season (which I just noticed that my ugly mug is the cover picture) where I had the chance to ride with a few players and have a few good chats with Andersen, then-Duck Peter Holland, and Hayward himself. We talked about a bunch of different topics including a talk with Holland (a Toronto native) about him playing in Anaheim growing up as a leafs fan and how he would feel about being able to play for the Leafs some day. Looks like he got his wish.   Hazy just seems to make some ridiculous statements, as do a lot of color guys (Jim Fox included god dammit) and I'm not a fan of the bullshit. Call the game like it is, talk about it like it is, and let's be fans of hockey instead of turning it into a my-team-vs-your-team circle jerk.  As for the GDT I will be at the game tonight so my commenting will be limited unfortunately. But Saturday (as long as I'm not actually playing puck myself with /u/Pen2Paper) then I will be watching the game and in the GDT!"
losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,2,Wed Mar 18 17:22:15 2015 UTC,Jim Fox is such a silly bitch sometimes.

losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,3,Wed Mar 18 20:09:36 2015 UTC,I'm waiting for the first season to finish so that I can just snag all the episodes at once and binge watch. Is it good?  I watched 4 fuckin seasons of Game of Thrones in like a month and I've been blue balled for the 5th season for like 5 months now.
losangeleskings,2zfp66,Trevoc555,2,Wed Mar 18 20:34:51 2015 UTC,"If you are a fan of the character in Breaking Bad, or the times of humor in the show (especially the dark humor) then it's fantastic. So far they've done a great job of keeping some BrB roots but allowing it to branch as a unique show.   I've been meaning to watch GoT but then I forget it's not on Netflix (as far as I know)."
losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,2,Wed Mar 18 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"I fucking loved breaking bad. I had a bit of a drug problem myself so it was a really tough show to watch (triggers are real) but I loved it.   It's not on netflix, it's on HBO and on Itunes. It's more than worth the money to buy the DVDs or to buy it on Itunes."
losangeleskings,2zfp66,Trevoc555,2,Wed Mar 18 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"It's a show that's hard not to love, Vince knows his shit.  I wouldn't doubt it's worth the money, but to be honest I'm just both lazy and worked for time. Perhaps during Spring Break....and as I typed that I realized that was a good idea. Holy shit, I have plans!"

losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,3,Wed Mar 18 16:43:52 2015 UTC,Welcome. Does that mean you have to go to the game tonight in a kings jersey /u/yogi_the_duck ?
losangeleskings,2zfp66,thegetawayplan9,2,Wed Mar 18 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"Well, the rules in the initial thread stated that it was up to the user to cross that bridge when they come to it. I will be there in my season seat in my Ducks jersey, as I always do. But I think more than anything tonight will be about hockey in general and not picking a side. If I came to the game tonight in a Kings jersey I'm pretty sure I'd be crucified by my neighbors who wouldn't understand what the user swap game is haha. So I'm going to be there tonight being as unbiased as I can possibly be, while maintaining an image. After tonight, I'm all yours."
losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,3,Wed Mar 18 17:47:54 2015 UTC,off topic: Do you have season ticket holders that magically transform into red wings fans when the wings come to town?  That seems to be a thing up here. I know a few season ticket holders that are huge kings fans but when the Wings come to town they come in wings jerseys. So odd to me
losangeleskings,2zfp66,thegetawayplan9,2,Wed Mar 18 17:55:07 2015 UTC,None that I know personally. The upper bowl is pretty set in stone as Ducks fans. Although the guy next to me is originally from Dallas and rooted for the stars the first 3 seasons here and just came to games to watch hockey and root against the Ducks but as he continued to watch games he became a Ducks fan. The true test of his loyalty came last post season and he passed.
losangeleskings,2zfp66,Yogi_the_duck,3,Wed Mar 18 18:00:12 2015 UTC,also can we agree to at least take this game to OT? Might as well help us both out.
losangeleskings,2zfp66,amper,2,Wed Mar 18 18:01:46 2015 UTC,Agreed. Let's shake on it.

losangeleskings,2zdzp6,CrispyLardon,7,Tue Mar 17 20:08:53 2015 UTC,"I think the top lines have been producing more as of late but I would agree that more improvement is needed.  As far as excitement, this has definitely been a season that has had some incredible highs and some dismal lows. For me both of those were exemplified in the Jan. 3rd game against Nashville (which I attended).  6-3 with only a few minutes on the clock, some people had already started to leave, then the Kings bury 3 in the net in a span of 1:28. The crowd went nuts, I yelled myself horse during that short span.  Then they blow it almost immediately in OT.  It's been a heck of a ride and I look forward to the remaining games."
losangeleskings,2zdzp6,EinsamWulf,2,Tue Mar 17 20:34:48 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more about that game--it's pretty much spot on for how this season has gone for sure.
losangeleskings,2zdzp6,tylerjehills,5,Tue Mar 17 21:06:00 2015 UTC,"This season seems like a long, drawn out version of last years postseason. So many heart attacks.

losangeleskings,2zdkq9,davidprevails,3,Tue Mar 17 21:20:23 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, only 2 of those wins were against playoff teams. In the remaining 9 away games, we play 7 playoff teams.  I'd say the article's point is pretty valid."

However The author referenced only our overall road record, which was extremely poor for most of the season and has been improving. That is why I said slightly.   edit- poor grammar"
losangeleskings,2zdkq9,dallenhill,4,Tue Mar 17 23:03:50 2015 UTC,tl:dr  Kings need to go 8-5 in remaining games.
losangeleskings,2zdkq9,LOUD__NOISES,3,Tue Mar 17 20:22:45 2015 UTC,Perfectly feasible. We got this.
losangeleskings,2zdkq9,Zanchbot,2,Wed Mar 18 05:44:31 2015 UTC,i like those odds!
losangeleskings,2zdkq9,dmcipod,2,Tue Mar 17 21:33:27 2015 UTC,5-4 on the road and 3-1 at home? that seems reasonable.
losangeleskings,2zbf4z,EricBurger,8,Tue Mar 17 04:20:45 2015 UTC,That goal was all Nolan. Who knew he could actually make a difference if he got ice time.
losangeleskings,2zbf4z,dalbtraps,4,Tue Mar 17 07:02:54 2015 UTC,Maybe the only good thing to come from Richards leaving. Nolan gets a locker and more ice time.
losangeleskings,2zbf4z,doot_doot,2,Tue Mar 17 07:45:01 2015 UTC,He didnt have a locker before?
losangeleskings,2zbf4z,Pen2Paper,4,Tue Mar 17 13:08:58 2015 UTC,He used to sit in the corner. When Richards got sent down he took over his locker space.
losangeleskings,2zbf4z,doot_doot,5,Tue Mar 17 16:10:13 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's a trooper."
losangeleskings,2zbf4z,Pen2Paper,3,Tue Mar 17 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"Paid off for him. Contract extension, way improved performance, couple of stanley cup team wins. I'm sure having the father he has taught him a thing or two about paying his dues and working his ass off for every shot."
losangeleskings,2zbf4z,doot_doot,3,Tue Mar 17 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"Nolan is my favorite player in the Kings, love them all but this quiet warrior always gives his best and the ""enforcer without hesitation"" aspect of his demeanor rocks."

losangeleskings,2zbf4z,Pen2Paper,3,Tue Mar 17 08:59:45 2015 UTC,"He's always had good hands and skating ability like we saw on the play. His decision making is what has improved, not taking (as many) selfish, dirty penalties and erring on the side of defense on a play."

I hope to Raccoon Jesus Stoll and Regehr are gone next year; no cap space for them and they're pretty not good at this point. I'm thinking Toffoli and Pearson get team friendly bridge deals for now, and while I would be sad to see Jones go, a backup is a backup. Williams is the only one I'm concerned about. I would really hate to see him leave, but we might very well be priced out of him.   If we don't sign Sekera, then lock Pearson/Toffoli up for a long time and take away the cap space from Stoll/Regehr so we still don't have to deal with them.   Oh and yes to Zykov as soon as he's ready. Love the kid."
losangeleskings,2zctxp,alexftw,5,Tue Mar 17 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"I was happy we drafted Valentin Zykov because he sounds like a bond villain, but I'm happier that there's a good shot he'll be a 1st liner in a few years."

losangeleskings,2zctxp,alexftw,3,Tue Mar 17 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"I think we probably get Sekera for 4 or 4.5. Basically the same deal Voynov had which then doesn't take away from any cap right now.   We don't resign Williams, Stoll or Regehr unless it's for a DEEP discount on Williams. Let Stoll and Regehr go. Toffoli and Pearson both sign bridge contracts at 3 mil a piece for 2 years.   edit: and unless Kopi really turns it up, I don't think he gets Kane/Toews money. The numbers just aren't there anymore."
losangeleskings,2zctxp,RubyRhod,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:01:56 2015 UTC,"Sekera for 4.5 would be amazing. I agree about Kopi. While he probably ""deserves"" it, the numbers aren't there.

losangeleskings,2zctxp,itzgreg20,2,Tue Mar 17 17:10:01 2015 UTC,The contract we had Sekera on was def a steal. One of the main reasons we dished him is b/c we weren't willing to pay him 4.5-5 mil I believe. Good luck with keeping him and continuing to win and giving us your draft pick.

losangeleskings,2zbj29,Beetush,12,Tue Mar 17 05:05:25 2015 UTC,Quick definitely deserved a shutout. And Andreoff that goal!  We need to bring more fight against the Ducks on Wednesday. Not gonna win every game with 1 goal.

losangeleskings,2zbj29,RubyRhod,7,Tue Mar 17 05:03:12 2015 UTC,"That was the most LA-esque game I've seen this season. They dominated the neutral zone, Quick played perfectly, and the defense absolutely STIFLED any offense. I can't think of a better-coached team from top-to-bottom than the Kings right now."
losangeleskings,2zbj29,gmuoug,4,Tue Mar 17 05:27:01 2015 UTC,It must be so different to watch them as a fan of another team. Last night they played ridiculously sloppy. They couldn't put a puck on stick to save their lives. Muzzin let like 4 easy passes by him out of the zone and our offensive play makers kept launching the puck right into Smith's stomach. It was frustrating for me to watch.
losangeleskings,2zbj29,RubyRhod,2,Tue Mar 17 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"I'm abroad right now, so I while I get to watch a good deal of SM-Liiga and KHL at convenient times, I don't really get to watch kings games all that often.  Do you remember some games where the kings played really well?  I'd be interested in downloading them to get my kings fix."
losangeleskings,2zbj29,gmuoug,2,Tue Mar 17 20:00:08 2015 UTC,"It's hard because I'm biased from watching them from a different perspective (i.e. MY TEAM). And sometimes it's not us playing well, it might be the other team playing poorly. Here are some examples from my memory:  Game 4 vs. Blackhawks WCF - I went to this game and we completely dismantled them. I was sitting around Hawks fans and it was brutal the first 2 periods. Both were incredibly highly skilled teams and we were playing perfectly.   More recently:  vs. the Canucks on March 12th and vs. Capitals on Feb 14th. Watch specifically how we defend/neutralize their offensive zone entries (when you watch a lot of games it becomes routine how they do it), how we closely support each other on our defensive zone exits, and how well we 3 man cycle in the offensive corners. One of our staples is the defensive zone exit in that we are close together for support. We rarely try long passes in our zone and usually have someone skating nearby to drop to.   EDIT: Watch any game where we win and Quick only faces around 20 shots on goal and we have about 30+. That's a pretty good indication of our system working."

As much as I love those sweet 2 points and a delicious SO for Quick, we need to start scoring goals. 1 may hold against the coyotes, but no way do I feel safe against the ducks or nucks with just one. Need to step up the goal scoring. 35 SOG and only 1 goes through? not ideal. Defense tonight was awesome, really fun to watch Muzz nail people all night long ;) Quick was perfect again, because he's fucking amazing."

losangeleskings,2z9jac,Growingpain,8,Mon Mar 16 19:22:35 2015 UTC,"Not at all legit, Chinese knockoffs.   The logos on fake Kings jerseys are always (IME) way oversized, and a thin shiny material, not flat/matte/twill. It gives it a very puffy appearance and it can look pretty awful if it gets washed. Numbering is usually very thick/fat. Also looks awful if washed. There's a fight strap that's a joke. You can usually rip it off by hand. Lots of loose threads/mis-stitching.  Most people won't know/care, but Kings fakes are quite obvious. If you're going the fake route, you're probably better off going straight to Ali Express than a big website. They have a review system. Don't pay more than $30. That's about all it's worth."

losangeleskings,2z3e7v,leftylogan,2,Sun Mar 15 04:37:03 2015 UTC,"What stood out most for me was that the Preds have found the way for their forecheck to counter the Kings exit out of their zone. The Kings like to do a couple of east-west passes as they exit, and the Preds just shut that down. They adapted a bit as the game progressed, but it was with mixed success. Kings need to come up with something different (and be fluid with it)."
losangeleskings,2z3e7v,swisschez,3,Sun Mar 15 16:45:55 2015 UTC,Yea Muzzin with Doughty towards the end? Sekera is MILES better with the puck than Muzzin is IMO. Would have liked to see him and Doughty on the back end for break outs.

losangeleskings,2z3e7v,lordjedediah,1 point,Sun Mar 15 04:47:40 2015 UTC,Kopi looked absolutely exhausted post game. What a 24 hours for him. Ines told him to play too.  Nashville deserved that win though. Great pressure on zone exits and great breaking the puck cycling. This is the kind of game where a break with Pearson could have helped us steal a second goal.
losangeleskings,2z3e7v,JakeeRase,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:12:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like Sutter always waits way too long to pull the goalie. I always feeling like with a one goal deficit, once you reach the 3 minute mark, you should be seriously considering it, and after there's only 2 minutes left, whenever you gain possession is when you go definitely for it. It seems like Sutter always waits until there's about a minute left, which just doesn't leave much time for anything. What's the harm? You're already about to lose, go for the chance to tie it up. Frankly we played like shit all damn night. At least in our own zone we did. The amount of turnovers was waaaay too high. Why are we passing in front of the crease so much?! and such long passes, too, it's way too risky in a one goal game. Muzz got unlucky, which sucks, but whatever, it happens. We have to be able to put up more than one goal, especially if we play that sloppy in our own zone. It's honestly surprising it was a one goal game, the way our puck handling was tonight. Everyone seemed off. Kopi gets a pass because he was probably about to explode from exhaustion after yesterday, and he didn't even play all that badly. Quick was good, kept us in it for sure. We don't really deserve a win when we play like that, we played too sloppy on defense and the Preds never really gave us a chance to put on consistent pressure on offense. At least Calgary managed to lose, but it would have been really nice to gain that ground, and the jets, nucks, and wild all won. Not a great night to lose. Oh well, hopefully Monday we can beat the Coyotes."

losangeleskings,2z3e7v,PissOnEddieShore,-10,Sun Mar 15 04:32:32 2015 UTC,"Jake Muzzin. Time to get rid of him. He has played terribly this whole season. Frankly, every time he touches the puck I get nervous. Deflects one in, then crashes into Quick a few minutes later.  /rant."
losangeleskings,2z3e7v,DamnRandall,9,Sun Mar 15 04:38:15 2015 UTC,"You are fucking crazy. Muzzin makes mistakes, but so do good defensemen all over the league. Seabrook makes mistakes, Karlsson makes mistakes, Subban makes mistakes. DOUGHTY makes mistakes. It is inevitable."

Everyone knows LA flips the switch when the playoffs come, and nobody does that more than Brown. Why doesn't he play like that every game? Because the physical toll would bust him up too much. Note how Brown started the 2012 playoff season on a tear but then slowed down towards the end. Playing that hard of a game is unsustainable over an 82 game season, you got to pick your spots. Brown knows this. Lombardi knows this.   Watch how Brown talks to the other guys during games, it is clear that he runs the locker room.

losangeleskings,2z0yls,heyitsEnricoPallazzo,2,Sun Mar 15 00:06:15 2015 UTC,Awesome! Would you like to be our sub's captain?  Captain responsibilities are:    Speak with other captains from other subs  Trade members with other subs  Draft other subs' members   So pretty much GM. Oh and captains can also be traded/drafted as well.

Or is that totally dumb  EDIT: Just a thought.. I guess I'd want teams already eliminated from the playoffs in my NMC too? I dunno, would that matter?"

We can all keep an eye out for each other while we learn how this crazy thing works.  And yes, you can choose eliminated teams in your NMC but you can only have up to three teams so choose wisely, haha."

losangeleskings,2z0yls,Pen2Paper,2,Sat Mar 14 21:27:54 2015 UTC,"I'm open to both length and captain.  EDIT: 2 weeks seems to be the popular answer -- put me down for that.  BTW, why don't you be captain since you seem to be doing most of the legwork.  If not you, how about one of the mods?"
losangeleskings,2z0yls,brutalyak,4,Sat Mar 14 23:06:55 2015 UTC,"You got it!  I was hoping one of the mods could be the captain since I figured they would have better knowledge of the game and /r/hockey's fanbase (I'm still a new fan).  But as of now, I'll just be the alternate captain until one of the mods or another reputable member decides to take the position."

losangeleskings,2z07p7,drcujo,7,Sat Mar 14 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"Seriously. ""Kings fans hate them"" lol  Nobody gives a fuck about the Flames. Yeah, they're a minor inconvenience at the moment. They're a team that is in way over their heads. They're the Colorado Avalanche of 2015, I want the Flames and the Kings in PAC 2 and 3 so bad just so the Kings can ruin their cute little Cinderella story in 5 games.   It's adorable how annoying a fan base can get after 1 decent season after sucking for years."
losangeleskings,2z07p7,BiohazardPixie,7,Sat Mar 14 10:00:54 2015 UTC,A lot of people might have said this about the kings in 2012 as well.   I like a close playoff race because it feels like an extra month or two of kings playoff hockey.
losangeleskings,2z07p7,Anarchyisbliss,2,Sat Mar 14 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"That's about where I am with it. A lot of what is said seems to be in jest and like born of teams not wanting to have to potentially deal with them in the playoffs, which is kind of a nice feeling. For all of the Wow the Kings are falling apart, wow Quick is terrible, there are a lot of people afraid to see what the Kings will do to their team post season.  I also don't really hold animosity for a specific fanbase myself, usually, my least favorite are the Hawks but that is totally because of a singular in person bad experience and that doesn't mean I hate them all. It's just the stupid people, really.  However what does agitate me, also happen to be those stupid people I mentioned. Like the people who think they're clever or bad ass when they try and chirp about needing Voynov if they want to beat team XYZ and stuff along that nature.   But yeah this comment, it's worth a chuckle, maybe a question mark. The Canucks aren't 2nd anymore...."
losangeleskings,2z07p7,BW4LL,2,Sat Mar 14 16:34:35 2015 UTC,That's the great thing about the Kings. They bring folks together in so many different ways.

I did not think we'd be so close with them at this point, and I'm just impressed with the year they've had and the way they play.

losangeleskings,2yy6e4,missrcc,7,Sat Mar 14 00:42:02 2015 UTC,"Oh boy. While most of me feels bad for Jumbo, part of me is wearing a shit-eating grin. That part of me is a dick."
losangeleskings,2yy6e4,DamnRandall,5,Fri Mar 13 21:35:41 2015 UTC,Nothing but respect for Jumbo as a hockey player. But as the Sharks Captain... no mercy.
losangeleskings,2yy6e4,Verneusses,3,Fri Mar 13 21:37:55 2015 UTC,I'd be fairly mad if the GM was talking shit about me after this weird half assed rebuild thing he's been doing.
losangeleskings,2yy6e4,OliverSmiff,2,Sat Mar 14 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"While I can't help but delight in this situation, Jumbo is well within his rights to be upset. Murray was way out of line and, if I was a Sharks fan, I'd be losing my mind with him for pulling this kind of shit during a playoff race. This aggression will not stand, man!"
losangeleskings,2yy6e4,krucz36,2,Sat Mar 14 04:01:39 2015 UTC,"Someone commented on the /r/hockey thread saying ""Every sharks fan will kill themselves before they see Thornton in a Kings sweater.""   I was like, sweet! let's do this deal!"

losangeleskings,2ywiy0,missrcc,15,Fri Mar 13 12:22:53 2015 UTC,Also shoutout to the Sharks fan at /r/hockey calling Quick a diver. Jesus fucking Christ

losangeleskings,2ywiy0,MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF,3,Fri Mar 13 17:26:29 2015 UTC,I like to look at this once a day.  because we have such a terrible no good awful Captain.
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,krucz36,4,Fri Mar 13 17:28:11 2015 UTC,But we do have a captain
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,DreamcastWriter,12,Fri Mar 13 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"-I know this sounds dumb, but I would rather miss the playoffs then have to face the kings in the 1st round.   I like this kind of mentality. It's not about the Kings missing the playoffs anymore. It's about preferring that your team miss the playoffs so you don't have to go against them."
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,flybyknight,4,Fri Mar 13 15:02:13 2015 UTC,Did you lose a flair bet or something?
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,RubyRhod,7,Fri Mar 13 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, right. So, /u/Pen2Paper convinced me to change it to Canucks flair because usually when I rep certain players they have slumps. But then I found out about /u/imcrazyama so I wanted to keep it for a while :/"
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,flybyknight,10,Fri Mar 13 17:04:37 2015 UTC,"Get under Captain Brown's skin. He is LA's weak link, mentally.   Wut. Isn't part of the reason he's Captain is because he's the head down, believe in your system/coaches, play hard mentality?"
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,RubyRhod,3,Fri Mar 13 16:25:57 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's why i pulled that quote. i thought it was weird and i was looking to get feedback on it. if you want to argue brownie's a weak link based on actual play, that's one thing. but he's not the type to get rattled and act a fool because of it."
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,krucz36,1 point,Sat Mar 14 00:32:11 2015 UTC,His maturing after that sit down with the staff was right before this three year run... I see it as not at all coincidental.
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,krucz36,1 point,Sat Mar 14 01:18:28 2015 UTC,yeah that was bizarre. Brownie's a system guy through and through
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,AngryMama5,8,Fri Mar 13 17:00:38 2015 UTC,Thank you for this.  I do love reading these and I'm sure they're a lot of work.
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,McGillicutty_192,8,Fri Mar 13 14:31:28 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or is it specifically Vancouver fans that are convinced that the Kings only have about 100 ""real"" fans?"

losangeleskings,2ywiy0,DamnRandall,16,Fri Mar 13 21:41:37 2015 UTC,"Only people not from California call the state ""Cali"".    If Kings winning hockey = boring, then I'm all for boring games. Although I reckon they think the game is boring because they aren't scoring.    Thanks, rcc!"
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,Thumper13,12,Fri Mar 13 15:22:34 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. I was born and raised and every once in a while I'll drop a Cali.  More often though, I'll say SoCal, because I don't want to be mistaken as being from NoCal."
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,krucz36,7,Fri Mar 13 16:25:00 2015 UTC,"Second this. Cali is rarer than others but still used by natives. I say ""San Diego"" instead of SoCal because I don't want anyone to think I'm from Orange County"
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,tikitessie,2,Fri Mar 13 17:00:18 2015 UTC,As an OC resident: :c we're not all insufferable.

losangeleskings,2ywiy0,krucz36,2,Fri Mar 13 21:17:32 2015 UTC,i guess...
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,DamnRandall,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:21:33 2015 UTC,"¯\(°_o)/¯    I suppose I'm only speaking from personal experience. Worked 10+ years in retail so I've talked to a lot of people. Met a lot of people from all the stuff I've gotten myself into. I can't recall a single time I've heard a SoCal or NorCal native call this place ""Cali,"" and I'm sure I'd remember as I would have found it odd.    Only time I've heard people say ""Cali"" were those from out-of-state or those who had moved from out-of-state to CA. My cousins from Hawaii call this place ""Cali"".    I live in the OC (""Don't call it that.""); I used to call this place ""the OC"" until I stopped and just started saying ""OC"".    Hey, if you want to call this place ""Cali,"" you do you, baby. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not your dad.    EDIT: The downvote button is for posts that add nothing to a conversation, not a Disagree button, but whatever."
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,Thumper13,2,Fri Mar 13 18:20:14 2015 UTC,"it's really rare to hear actual californians say ""cali"". now that i live in washington i hear it all the damn time."
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,bslapshot,1 point,Sat Mar 14 00:30:23 2015 UTC,"I'll say this though. While I, and several ex-Californians I know will occasionally SAY Cali, I have to agree with the post. I don't think I've ever spelled it except here in this post. I would never type it.   The terrorists have won if you say ""OC"" or ""the OC."""
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,krucz36,2,Fri Mar 13 20:20:49 2015 UTC,"I can second this. People from Arizona say ""Cali"" all the time. I've heard it more in the past few years in AZ than ever before. I think it depends on the area you're from because I know people from Norcal who say ""Cali"" a lot."
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,krucz36,5,Fri Mar 13 19:18:54 2015 UTC,There is no team in the nhl that is like this to play against. When the kings are on their game they are almost impossible to beat
losangeleskings,2ywiy0,madmusic420,10,Fri Mar 13 16:07:11 2015 UTC,"I've said it a lot before...when the kings are on their game it's just a nightmare for the other team. Nothing goes where they want it to, nothing is clean, no easy passes, just miserable. it feels like they kings have an extra skater or two most times."

losangeleskings,2ywiy0,-Excitebike-,2,Fri Mar 13 14:50:11 2015 UTC,"I went to Vancouver in 2012 2 months after the Kings won the cup. I was rocking Kings gear and you know what? Canucks fans up there were extremely polite and would congratulate the Kings and strike up hockey convos with me. I got ""Are you actually from California"" quite a few times though. Canucks fans I have encountered at Staples though, most of them have been complete assholes and I have heard the same from friends I have who are Ducks fans."
