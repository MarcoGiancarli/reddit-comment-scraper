Awwducational,3e28x8,unijmn,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the link! This study deals mostly with changing conditions on adhesion rather than the character of the material itself. They were still able to climb wet glass so long as their own feet were dry (barely). The same structure that makes gecko feet so good at harnessing van der waals forces also makes them extremely hydrophobic (water repellant not afraid ;) ). This hydrophobicity makes a bubble of air across the foot pad which prevents contact with the material surface thus interfering with the adhesion.

Awwducational,3e28x8,SirFancyMcFancePants,19,Tue Jul 21 11:59:15 2015 UTC,"/u/yzhfdrfg, /u/SirFancyMcFancePants had you covered in this case, but in the future please provide a link to the source for your fact in the comments.   I have a doubt when it comes to ""the only known material part"". Geckos certainly can't stick to teflon, but whether teflon is the only material in the world that cancels out van der waals forces (and whatever other mechanisms geckos use to stick) is a tall claim. I can't find anything countering the claim however so this is getting provisionally verified."
Awwducational,3e28x8,F0RTUN3,19,Tue Jul 21 13:58:23 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia is usually not a credible source :) (if anything, it tends to vary over time). If we look at Wikipedia's source, which was probably the introductory page of a researcher, it sheds some light as to why the archenemy of gecko's might be teflon:    [author's main interests are...] specifically dry adhesive feet such as those possessed by spiders and geckos. These operate by van der Waals interactions so that sticking is as easy as touch and go!  Why van der Waals? [something about intermolecular force] This means that the key to dry adhesion is the shape or geometry of the adhesive, rather than the chemistry. Other insects which stick by secretions (e.g. ants, beetles, flies, etc.) are much more picky about what types of surfaces they stick to. Geckos can stick to any surface, with the exception of Teflon, which was specifically engineered to prevent even van der Waals adhesion. (You might say that Teflon is the Anti-Gecko.)   (sources for these statements are at the bottom of the page)"
Awwducational,3e28x8,plusonegoat,12,Tue Jul 21 13:09:22 2015 UTC,"So van der waals forces are pretty neat. When two atoms bond together they do not necessessarily have the same properties. Think of the atoms involved in the bond as a planet and a moon. The 'gravity'  between the two is uneven since one is bigger (more electronegative) than the other. In atoms what you end up with is called a dipole, represented with the lower case greek letter delta, with a positive pole and a negative pole like a magnet. Two of these polar molecules will attract each other weakly. This is one component of van der waals forces (namely the London Dispersion Force). There are others, but this is the basic one. Van der waals is involved with properties of molecules like solubility and is involved with how proteins fold and attach to ligands.   The effect is cumulative, so a geckos feet have a lot of surface area thus more polar molecules to interact with a surface. Since teflon is non-polar, geckos cannot take advantage of the interaction between polar molecules.  I hope this makes a little sense. If you're a chemist and this oversimplification gives you acute nausea feel free to jump in and clarify!"
Awwducational,3e28x8,Geckos,7,Tue Jul 21 14:16:58 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately that page doesn't exist anymore so I did a little more digging. This article here states that Geckos take advantage of van der Waals forces to stick to surfaces. Okay, cool. Here's another article that states that Teflon (PTFE) is a completely apolar surface. You can find that under section 4, Young's equation, second paragraph. This is where I get lost. I'm not sure if a completely apolar surface equals resistance to van der Waals.  I couldn't find any articles that specifically said, ""Geckos cannot stick to Teflon."" Maybe someone else has more luck."
Awwducational,3e28x8,plusonegoat,4,Tue Jul 21 13:33:08 2015 UTC,Just to add to the educational part: there is a product called Fluon that is often used by entomologists. Insects and geckos cannot climb on/stick to Fluon. Fluon is essentially tiny particles of plastic in a water suspension.  Also this appears to be a giant Madagascar day gecko (Phelsuma madagascariensis).  Source: I am a herpetologist. Though there is a paper testing Fluon on geckos. If anyone is interested I can try to find it.

Awwducational,3e28x8,SilentSynth,3,Tue Jul 21 19:03:13 2015 UTC,Ahh thanks for bringing this up. It used to be that P.m. grandis was just a subspecies of P. madagascariensis. P. grandis was elevated to its own species in the mid 2000s. It's difficult to tell which this is just from the picture though.   Knowing where this picture was taken might help...  Edit: I don't work with these species in particular but it looks like people still alternate between using the subspecies (P.m. grandis) and species (P. grandis) nomenclature.

Awwducational,3dw5yd,MushroomGoats1,44,Mon Jul 20 01:06:42 2015 UTC,I've always wondered - how do breeders manage to propagate a whole stable population from just a very small amount of genetic diversity like that? Shouldn't they all be terribly inbred and prone to health problems? What do they do to minimize that?
Awwducational,3dw5yd,sapiophile,37,Mon Jul 20 05:27:13 2015 UTC,"inbreeding really isn't as large an issue as most make it out to be, even in humans. The rate with first cousins would be rather low, higher than 2 strangers but still low and it just gets lower the further out you go. I imagine 11 chinchillas, 5 sets of 2 and another one just screwing everything that breathed would result in some major diversity pretty quickly."
Awwducational,3dw5yd,David_mcnasty,29,Mon Jul 20 05:52:27 2015 UTC,"Uh. Kinda. Whenever scientists talk about establishing a genetically healthy population of animals the number generated is always higher than ~300 individuals, and depending which study you listen to can go into the thousands.  Basically you can't screw your way to diversity - stable, harmless mutations are quite rare. You're stuck with the alleles you start with in a population for a long time.  Every chinchilla in this population probably has a crazy high coefficient of inbreeding if you include enough back generations. That said, you're right that inbreeding is not actually as devastating as most people think."

Awwducational,3dsfif,Mrs_Holman_7,4,Sun Jul 19 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"Koalas are terrible. I'd like to share with you some of my koala knowledge!!   It takes a koala four days to digest a meal: Fact. The word ""koala"" comes from the aboriginal language meaning ""no drink"" indicating the first of the three rules for gremlins. Koalas sing to defend their territories and win mates, like blue birds or Michael Buble. Koalas are not bears. Koalas are Hellspawn, and like everything else in Australia they know only hate. More beastly than Hank McCoy, these blue-grey creatures have razor sharp claws and a voice that sounds like a tiger dry heaving. I'm not sure where the bear comparison comes from; they are less Smokey and more Fozzie bear with that stupid Muppet nose. Real bears eat delicious things like salmon, berries, honey, and ants; the bare necessities of life. Koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves, which are an ingredient in cough syrup. It was believed it made them drunk and pass out, but robotripping is just how koalas roll.  Eucalyptus is not very nutritious so they must spend five hours a day eating, eighteen hours a day sleeping, which leaves just one hour to get their mack on. Like many other marsupials, koalas are social creatures and like many other drug addicts they are mostly antisocial creatures. Koalas have a scent gland on their chest they use to mark their territory, so they aggressively hug trees to leave their stank. Koala have uncannily human-like fingerprints they use to grip things. They also have large claws to help grip even harder. They also have two thumbs. You do not want to be gripped by a koala. Koalas are afraid of paper bags. Researchers use a pole-mounted paper bag to coax koalas out of trees. Half of koala pregnancies are sired not by resident alpha males like Buster and Hendrix, but by koala charlatans like Captain Bogart who roam the suburbs, looking for ladies and a fix. Only the toughest of koalas can survive on the streets with their devil-may-care attitude and shapely ears. At the culmination of the violent tantrum which is koala coitus, the male leaves a seminal plug which blocks the female's multiple vaginas from being entered by the hemipenis of another koala. Koalas are a protected species so its illegal to touch or pick one up without a permit. This is for the protection of the humans, not the koala. Also koalas get sick. During this documentary I saw a koala named James got Chlamydia and lost his territory to Hendrix, who then got Chlamydia and was taken to an animal hospital before it got to full-on wet bottom. Continuing the tradition of cuddlefying these monsters, ""wet bottom"" is what they call a urinary infection that stains their fur. Basically an STD leads to them pissing all over themselves. Finding out that koalas have Chlamydia is like finding out that ponies get herpes or that kittens have AIDS. Both of those things are true by the way. But the most common cause of death for koalas is reckless drivers.    So to recap: sleep 18 hours, voracious appetite, car accidents… I was a teenage koala"

Awwducational,3dmfjg,callsyourcatugly,25,Fri Jul 17 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"Vegetarian spider here! I’m a pro-vegetarian spider activist and blogger (Fly meat is murder!) I’m happy to answer your question and fill you in on our lifestyle.   I love a teaching moment! Thank you for your ignorance!   Just because we don’t use webs for the purposes of indiscriminate murder, doesn’t mean we don’t enjoy some of the same hobbies and activities as meat-eating spiders!   Many vegetarian spiders spin webs for other uses (e.g. hammock, ornament display around the holidays, storage). We do post warning signs, which has led to conflict among certain vegetarian spiders and our developmentally retarded kin.   This is our world, too, bug munchers!     I apologize for my outburst. I recently attended a regional web-building competition in Dallas and found vegetarian spiders are still regulated to competing our own division. But, then, it’s not surprising.   Spider vegetarianism is something no one wants to talk about, least of all the mainstream media whose pockets are lined with fly flesh. Seriously, Google it.   There was a time when all humans hated all spiders, making no distinction among our various species or cultures, even confusing us with insects. This no longer the case.   Today, pro-spider messaging promoting a spider-human alliance is rampant.    Guerrilla marketing campaigns are taken at face-value. Has anyone actually ever interviewed Spider Bro? How do we even know he’s really a spider? Or, the bigger question everyone’s afraid to ask, how do we know he’s really a bro?     What people don’t realize is today’s pro-spider agenda, is actually a pro-meat-eating spider agenda disguised as progress.   Ask yourself who has the most to gain from all the stricter synthetic pesticide regulations today? Everyone knows organic pesticides are rubbish! Who’s behind it?   Fly-breathe, meat-eating spider radicals and their Washington lobbyist lackeys, that's who!    Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying I want to go back to a day when all spiders were regarded as dangerous villains.   My Uncle Hank, a life-long vegetarian and practicing Buddhist, suffered a deadly perfume attack, left to die in a glass cell secured under no fewer than three graduate-level textbooks and a Webster’s Student Dictionary.   Investigators concluded the murder weapon, Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker, to be non-toxic. The spider coroner ruled drowning as the cause of death in what detectives called a “classic case of overkill”.    Officials believe Hank was mistaken for a brown recluse, (Autopsy photo; Hank pictured on bottom.), raising accusations of victim-blaming and a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of vegetarian spider culture.    Check your meat-eating spider privilege, carni-whores!  Yes, we spin webs. Yes, we share commonalities with all spiders, even fly-suckers. Of course, I'm heartened by the newly embraced “some spiders are our friends” mentality. But, at what cost? How long will vegetarian spiders be marginalized, rendered indistinguishable by the media from our evolutionarily-impaired cousins?   Only time will tell. I'll leave you with this."
Awwducational,3dmfjg,AustinTreeLover,7,Fri Jul 17 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"Now I feel like I was callous toward the plight of the vegetarian spider and I have to confess something:  I once startled a vegetarian spider chilling out, minding its own business in my bathroom.  I thought for a moment about what I should do, I could condemn it to a watery grave down the sink, or I could be a good person and let it live in nature.  I looked around and found a stack of dixie cups and a box of tampons.  I carefully slid the vegetarian spider underneath a stack of about 10 dixie cups from my counter onto the box of tampons. I thought I would do good by taking the spider to my backyard and swiftly fling it to safety.  When the spider and I were safely outside, I sort of released the the spider into the warm air by snapping my wrists in order to achieve maximum distance away from me.. along with the entire stack of cups and all the tampons.  I was left holding one dixie cup and an empty box in my hands.  I sincerely hope I didn't end up crushing the poor spider while I frantically collected my unmentionables.

Awwducational,3dch6v,AngelaMotorman,6,Wed Jul 15 15:24:05 2015 UTC,My father had a beefalo calf when he was a child. It was apparently a very cantankerous creature. It chased him in the house and grandma chased it back outside with broom. I doubt it was a cute as this guy.
Awwducational,3dch6v,remotectrl,11,Wed Jul 15 06:19:53 2015 UTC,I never really considered their existence before and it's interesting that they're fertile. A lot of the hybrids I learned about in genetics were infertile. Cattle and buffalo both have 60 chromosomes which leads to less complications during meiosis and allows for fertile offspring. Awesome!
Awwducational,3dch6v,sryguys,6,Wed Jul 15 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"It's apparently a big problem with wild populations becoming hybridized with cattle with only a handful of ""pure"" bison remaining. The similarity in genetics and physiology also means they are susceptible to cattle diseases.  According to my father, the reason you'd raise beefalo instead of just regular cattle is that you can get the large shoulders of the bison mixed with the large hindquarters of a angus, for a larger, meatier animal."
Awwducational,3dch6v,remotectrl,4,Wed Jul 15 14:35:56 2015 UTC,"Supposedly the Yellowstone herd (which the ones in my photo belong to) is ""genetically pure"" without any cattle genetics, but there's a few folks out there that theorize that there's likely some introgression in there."

They're pretty awesome in the game, though are aggressive in mating season (they get little red bums when they are). Unless of course you're wearing a ""beefalo hat"" which is made with their wool and horns in the game (and you get to look hilarious with a giant horned hat), as a bonus it also helps keep you from freezing to death when it's winter in the game.  Of course this is pretty much entirely unrelated to anything here. But they are cute! >_>"

This one bear that I call Blondie is a smaller lighter colored bear she was fishing and not having a lot of luck. This other bear came along and he had his whole face in the water. He walked along like that and sure enough scooped up a salmon in seconds. Blondie was just watching him with her head cocked. Then she plunges her head in and starts scubaing around too.

Awwducational,3d0hoh,uliarliarpantsonfire,3,Mon Jul 13 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"It IS awesome but seriously those Alaska shows are like 90% hyped up & dramatic. Some of them are realistic, but totally blown out of proportion. There was one show where these guys from different states (like one was Minnesota) lived in the woods (wilder men? Wild men?) and one of them was Alaskan.. They had his part all ""I'm gonna die"" ""I'm in the middle of nowhere"" yadda - he lived just a few miles from a friends house, and the highway.  Alaska can be dangerous & amazing but those shows really blow them up. That said? Stunningly beautiful, awesome wildlife -go driving at dusk/night during the summer & you'll see a ton of moose, possibly bears depending where (like Valdez you'll see bears) - and the people here are great. If you like fishing Alaska is a dream. Valdez, pink salmon, you can snag the fish. Like literally, just toss your hook, reel, jerk, reel, jerk, reel, jerk and you snag them.. And it's legal. Fun when you get one on the tail!  Very cool you have goats & chickens! If you're farmers, don't move to Alaska :D I have goats, chickens, rabbits, etc and have owned practically everything short of cows & horses and damn it's expensive. Long winter, not much foraging, and during the summer we really stress the animals - the rabbits have near back to back pregnancies because for 4-5 months it's the only time of the year they can really breed. Note: breed 2 weeks after they give birth, wean at 6 weeks, free feed, and they get a long winter break, they are plenty happy and healthy but still, would prefer if I could give them more breaks. But -60F is not breeding time lol.   And the goats are expensive as hell to keep. How much do you pay for a bale of hay/size?"
Awwducational,3d0hoh,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:01:30 2015 UTC,"Right now hay is $3.50 a square bale from our regular guy. It might go up though because we have had a ridiculous amount of rain this year. Ours graze though from late spring till late fall and barely eat any hay. The winter gets us but we only have the 3 goats right now so it's not too bad. We have about 50 chickens and sell eggs from them that pays for their feed, so our eggs are free for us. We also have geese that turned out a lot of eggs this year. We aren't farmers though, we are mostly just trying to be more self sufficient.   Hubby hunts and we both like to fish, so we watch those shows and boy it's alluring. Plus where we live now we are out in the country but our county supervisors approved a natural gas plant to move in 5 houses down and a CAFO pig farm a mile away, and anther CAFO in the middle of our town. The one in town has already moved in, so when you go to get ice cream or pizza on certain days it's enveloped in pig stench. The supervisors themselves moved out of town quietly after approving those. We only just recently found out and have no idea how to even begin to fight. Last week we found out that they won't be pulling water from the river for this plant but are going to drill into the aquifer that our well water comes from. Apparently when they were first approved they said they would need 6,000 gallons a day, at this meeting they announced they would ""only"" need 25,000 gallons a day.  Someplace away from people sounds really good.   We watch the buying Alaska show where they sell cabins and such. We watch the one with the Browns too but it's really hokey. The best one is The Last Alaskans it's on the Animal Planet and seems to be lacking all the ridiculousness of other reality shows. It's really beautiful. According to the documentary they are some of the last families allowed to occupy the arctic national wildlife refuge. It looks so amazing."
Awwducational,3d0hoh,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Mon Jul 13 02:07:16 2015 UTC,"I pay about $12 a bale! Goats are not very efficient here  For me, rabbits are the real money makers. My Hollands would have 4-5 kits, and I could sell them $50 each. It's hard when they're not breeding, but once they do, you really get your money back. I've got some rarer breeds too who are going to begin breeding next month, and I can sell those for $50-$100 each. Covers the feed bill for all of them & the chickens, but until they start breeding I'm not sure about the goats.. May need to sell them /:   Ugh, that's too bad. livng near a pig cafo has to be awful. Yep move to Alaska haha.   The last Alaskans is pretty realistic in terms of what it's like living in the middle of nowhere, but it certainly makes Alaska look uncivilized haha. Which in a lot of areas it is, but others it's pretty normal. I've definitely done a lot of the stuff they've done (nothing living full sufficient but gathering wood at -30f, trapping, mushing etc) and it's fun but it's very... Gross I guess haha. I love going out and not showering for a week and sleeping at -30f (I'm a wimp, don't go out when it's -60 more than necessary) but I could never give up a nice shower LOL."
Awwducational,3d0hoh,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:29:34 2015 UTC,$12 a bale would be awful! I'd be turning to rabbits too in that case! What are your hunting limits like up there?   Yeah I'd have a hard time with the no shower thing too! It wouldn't be bad in the short time but after awhile it would get old. I keep wondering why they don't have solar or wind power? It seems like that would be ideal and the little they would use wouldn't take much just one turbine and a couple of panels on a tracker. We are hoping to go that way ourselves soon. Right now we have well water and wood to supplement our heating. If I lived remote like that I think I would definitely want that and a composting or incinerating toilet!
Awwducational,3d0hoh,uliarliarpantsonfire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:45:45 2015 UTC,"Yup. I only give the wooled rabbits hay regularly, everyone else it's a treat & they get branches regularly to munch on if they want (free feed pellets).  Hmm.. How does it work there? Here we have regions & it depends which region you are in. But generally for a resident you can get (depending on the year): 1 moose, 1-2 caribou, 1 grizzly, up to 5 black bears (year round hunting iirc in all regions). For small game like fox you have to check the region. For specifically what you can kill (like 60"" horns, or paddles moose) then that's the region. For cows you either have to be drawn for it like moose or for caribou it depends on the region & year. Like 2 years ago the caribou were all by the side of the highways so they were totally slaughtered & last year they had limits on the caribou you could get like no does.  I believe one has a satellite, don't they? Not sure. But getting started with solar is very expensive especially in the winter with such little daylight. Takes like 7-11 years or something like that before it pays itself off. Can't speak for wind."

Oh and those limits are hunting with everything like there's a bow season, black powder, etc. he hunts all of them to be able to qualify for the 3 deer a year and he has to send in doe tags and it's dependent on the amount of doe permits they are allowing for the year. Since we've been married it's been 3 permits that he's gotten per year but that's subject to change and getting your permit request in on the first day.   I'm not sure if they did have a satellite or not, I know the young couple had a satellite phone they used to call their family. Yeah if you do a whole house system it's a big investment but you could run at least their lights for not too much. I don't know how much shipping would be there though. Just for lighting though they could start with something like these it's not a lot of light but preferable to lanterns and such. Of course you'd have to tie in a turbine for the dark months though something like this would do all their little inside lights. Of course you'd have to mount them on poles because of the snow, but it'd be worth a shot. I wonder if maybe the extreme cold would be a problem for the equipment though."

Awwducational,3cx9cp,Alantha,3,Sat Jul 11 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"The premise of this article is very strange. It freely admits that attacks are up, but the statistical likelihood of being bitten is much lower because of more people.  It's kind of like saying I'm less likely to be crowned King of all England now than in the middle ages, because the global population has increased.  They are, however, right that the 2014 Western Australia shark cull was massively controversial. Very few people seemed to support it, and there were really big protests."

Awwducational,3cx9cp,but_im_not_a_monster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:06:15 2015 UTC,"But I'm not confused. You've just reiterated my point.   Yes, it would be unlikely to be crowned king of England bitten by a great white shark in the middle ages 1950, but its even less likely now.   To put it another way, an individual sheep in a flock is statistically less likely to get eaten by a wolf than one standing alone in a field. It doesn't make wolves less dangerous to sheep.  This article is simply saying the numbers of beach-goers has increased, not that sharks have changed their behaviour. According to the author, there are in fact more shark attacks now than in 1950."

I understand that there are more shark attacks, but the rate that the shark attacks have increased is much lower than the rate of population growth/rate of how many people are now going to the beach...    The article wasn't suggesting that sharks have changed their behaviour, its simply saying that it is statistically less likely to get attacked by a shark now.      What are you trying to say?"

Awwducational,3cfhcq,mufcreddevil7,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:12:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delay getting back to you! So, from what I gather, the authors recognized that possibility too, but don't think it's very likely to explain the behavior. Here's their thoughts on the matter, if you want a bit more detail:    The significant increase of stick-displaying behavior by alligators [...] could be alternatively explained by higher numbers of sticks floating in the water, either due to the birds’ activity or to rookery trees shedding twigs this time of year. Both these explanations seem unlikely. Virtually no freely-floating sticks or twigs were seen by the observer at that time [...]   Any available sticks were probably quickly picked up by birds looking for nest material. Later, at or immediately prior to the time of chicks fledging, there were some incidences of sticks falling from nests, or even entire nests partially disintegrating, but by that time the stick-displaying activity had already decreased. Of the two species of trees dominating the rookery sites – baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo (Nissa aquatica) – neither is known to shed branches or twigs, and both shed leaves in the fall rather than in spring.   So the short version is ""probably not,"" but it's definitely a good point to bring up though!"

I'm not sure about spoonbills, but for egrets and herons: the males build the nests first, and use them to attract a mate. So at least for them, the female will be fertilized after the nest is built.   Cool fact from the article: the spoonbills and egrets they observed actually preferred building nests near the croc habitats. Seems weird at first, but it turns out that the crocs keep out snakes and raccoons (which can be big threat to the birds, since they climb trees).

Awwducational,3cfnz8,Alantha,2,Tue Jul 7 15:28:20 2015 UTC,"Bioluminescence is a form of chemiluminescence where light energy is released by a chemical reaction. Aside from these beautiful sharks many other species, both marine and terrestrial, also have this ability; fireflies, angler fish, jellyfish, squid, etc. It can be used to attract a mate, lure prey or as counterillumination in the ocean to blend in to the surrounding water.  The three shark families above use bioluminescence in two ways. The Megamouth shark have bioluminescent areas around their mouths to attract prey. Cookie cutter sharks and Velvet lantern sharks use bioluminescence for counterillumination. Lantern sharks also illuminate their spines (which you can see in the image) to let predators know they would not be fun to eat!  As I stated in the title, there is only one species of Megamouth shark in family Megachasmidae. There are several species of Lantern shark Family Etmopteridae and Cookie cutter shark Family Dalatiidae though that exhibit this very cool adaptation.  If you have been watching Shark Week this was briefly mentioned in an episode as ""Only 3 sharks use bioluminescence."" This was an incredibly unclear statement which I figured I'd clear up. As you can see it is 3 families of shark, not 3 sharks all together!"

The method is to drive each group of swans into the bank, where the cob and pen have their beaks examined to ascertain ownership, and the cygnets are then similarly marked by making nicks with a sharp knife. The Dyers and the Vintners Companies are now the only owners of private swans on the Thames, the Worshipful Company of Dyers marking theirs with a nick on one side of the beak, and the Worshipful Company of Vintners marking theirs with a nick on each side. The latter is the origin of the inn sign 'A Swan with Two Necks'. (i.e. two 'nicks'). Royal swans are now left unmarked."" [see link for diagrams of other marks that were made]"

Parentage analysis uncovered 112 cases of EGP (17.8% of the 629 pups assigned a father). Pups that were the product of EGP were on average more genetically heterozygous than pups that are the product of within-group matings. This is in accordance with previous work, which found that females mating with extra-group males were less related to their mates than females that mated within-group (Nichols et al. 2014). Pups fathered by extra-group males were significantly heavier at emergence from the natal den (30–40 days old) than pups fathered by within-group males (LMM: χ2(1) = 5.28, P = 0.022, Table 2, Figure 1b). Furthermore, pups fathered by extra-group males were significantly more likely to survive to nutritional independence (90 days) than within-group pups (LMM: χ2(1) = 5.43, P = 0.020, Table 3, Figure 1c).

Awwducational,3brjhg,VoilaVoilaWashington,3,Wed Jul 1 15:58:46 2015 UTC,"That would make sense. Many herbivores have to eat a lot of food with little nutritional value, and in the case of birds, their poop is also their pee - in other words, they convert nutritionally poor seaweed and grass into poop and pee.   Let's do the math for a human: since most people produce more urine than feces by a wide margin, let's just go with that. Assuming an average human is 50 kg, and they pee 1 l per day, it would take 50 days to urinate their body weight. In other words, 7x per year."

Awwducational,3bipgf,ksye,11,Mon Jun 29 15:34:44 2015 UTC,"According to wikipedia its because    One explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they can exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil. This would explain why slit pupils tend to be found in the eyes of animals with a crepuscular or nocturnal lifestyle that need to protect their eyes during daylight. Constriction of a circular pupil (by a ring-shaped muscle) is less complete than closure of a slit pupil, which uses two additional muscles that laterally compress the pupil.[7] For example, the cat's slit pupil can change the light intensity on the retina 135-fold compared to 10-fold in humans.[8] However, this explanation does not account for circular pupils that can be closed to a very small size (e.g., 0.5 mm in the tarsier) and the rectangular pupils of many ungulates which do not close to a narrow slit in bright light.[9] An alternative explanation is that a partially constricted circular pupil shades the peripheral zones of the lens which would lead to poorly focused images at relevant wavelengths. The vertical slit pupil allows for use of all wavelengths across the full diameter of the lens, even in bright light.[2] It has also been suggested that in ambush predators such as some snakes, vertical slit pupils may aid in camouflage, breaking up the circular outline of the eye.[10]   link for wiki article"

Awwducational,3bipgf,surfnaked,32,Mon Jun 29 21:21:38 2015 UTC,I wonder if it's because the big cats are diurnal sight hunters and most of the smaller cats are nocturnal hearing and sight hunters. I think my cat can hear a mouse fart at about 200 yards.

Awwducational,3bipgf,avelertimetr,13,Mon Jun 29 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"We got us a mystery! I did some digging and I think there's an optical explanation.  A slit pupil has a narrower aperture along the horizontal making for higher horizontal resolution. Most prey will be moving horizontally where a higher res will be an advantage, whereas vertical plane is mostly surface features. Its not like small cats are blind to the vertical plan, its just that the horizontal is favored. Also small cats, as small animals with large eyes, have multifocal lenses that correct for chromatic aberration. The lens is broken up into multiple concentric parts. A round pupil would not work with multifocal lenses so little cats adapted slit pupils and larger cats like lions and leopards have monofical lenses and round pupils. I suppose by having a bigger eye that chromatic aberration is less of an issue for them.  I found a good /r/askscience thread about this"

Awwducational,3bfvg0,you_freak_bitch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:41:24 2015 UTC,"All wild animals can carry disease and bats as a zoonotic reservoir are special in a few ways, though some of it may be confirmation bias (ie we keep finding new diseases in bats because we keep looking at them).   There are more bat species than any other mammal group except rodents. Rodents have more total, but bats have slightly more per species. This may be due to their more social nature which allows pathogens to spread more easily than in solitary species. They are also much more mobile than most other mammals allowing for more rapid dispersal of diseases. They've also gotten a lot of attention recently so it may not be that they have more diseases than any other creatures so much as we are looking more at them. This attention is due in part to some rather serious diseases like Marburg that have emerged as humans come into contact more often with bats.   Did I miss anything, /u/you_freak_bitch and /u/AGreatWind?"
Awwducational,3bfvg0,BlayneTX,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:27:27 2015 UTC,"Pretty spot on /u/remotectrl! I was reading somewhere about the social structure of bats in colonies also facilitates the spread of viruses between individual bats. For reservoir hosts this affords opportunity for evolution: with each passage of a virus through a host the virus and the host acclimate to each other.   In addition to Marburg, SARS, Nipah, and Hendra make bats their homes. Hendra actually needs an amplifying host in order to infect people, many bat rescuers in Australia were routinely exposed to scratches and bites from infected  bats in their care but never contracted the virus. It needs to get into horses before it makes the jump to humans."

By flying bats are, according to this hypothesis, inducing a kind of fever when they fly that triggers innate immune responses. This hypothesis tries to explain why bats are such good reservoirs. This hypothesis is plausible, but untested (as far as I've read). This changing metabolic environment somehow acclimates the virus to the host. I would love to see more data on this.  As to pursuing research I suggest doing an undergraduate research project, talk to your advisor or favorite prof about this. Such a project will familiarize you with assorted basic techniques (PCR, solution prep, chromatography, cloning, etc.) that will come in handy later, both in the lab and on your CV. For now just bang out your undergrad credits. If infectious disease is your thing then I would focus on cell bio, molecular bio, proteomics, genetics, and genomics."

The mammalian family tree keeps getting shuffled because of emerging genetic evidence as well. In any case, we know bats have been around for at least 50 million years so they have been separate from primates and rodents for quite a while! That means that if we assume they have diversified at the same rate as other mammals that some bats are less closely related to each other than bears are to seals, since the earliest Carnivorans are believed to have evolved around 42 million years ago.

This was the most interesting part of the research to me:     In contrast, C. pulcher sp. n. has a wider areola and the body shape compared to C. boesemani is more slender, thus it is adapted to fast flowing water with higher dissolved oxygen levels. In general, lake crayfish also get bigger in size then the creek or river species.   However it is irrelevant to the species' color, and for me to ELI5 what a crayfish's areola is in a title would've become /r/titlegore and the comments may have devolved into a tangent on boobs, as many people (including myself) have only heard of areolas in that context."

Think about it, peacock males are the pretty, flamboyant ones, and male birds of all kinds have pretty songs to attract mates. It's the female peacocks that are plain brown.

Awwducational,3b18f7,beve21,20,Thu Jun 25 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, tree shrews do this too! They use the pitcher plant as a toilet, which helps prevent predators from finding them through their droppings, and the plant gets nitrogen from their feces (which is why carnivorous plants exist in the first place-- they cannot get enough nitrogen from the soil, so they get nitrogen from breaking down the proteins that make up the small insects they eat). Also, the pitcher plant has a nectar it makes that the tree shrew licks/eats, so it also provides the tree shrew with nutrition.

Awwducational,3b2w1w,Alantha,3,Thu Jun 25 15:06:00 2015 UTC,"Mental Floss article  PubMed article  So to expand on this a little:  Spongy Bone  The spongyness of the bone absorbs the shock of the head strike, much like the bumper on your car. Because it gives a little the force is spread out instead of concentrated in one spot.   Hyoid bone and tongue  We have a hyoid bone as well! It's a horseshoe shape and parts of our tongue and throat muscles attach to it. In the woodpecker their tongues are also attached at this point, but the difference is instead of starting in the throat, it starts either around the tongue, or sometimes all the way up around the eye in some species. This wrapping acts as a shock absorber as well. Here is an example of what it looks like.  Uneven beak  Woodpeckers have a slightly longer lower beak than upper. What this does is when the bird strikes a tree trunk (or your siding on your house!) the lower beak takes the brunt of the impact. This sends the vibration along the lower beak and skull and away from the brain which is very important.  A few adaptations I didn't have room for in the title:  Small brain case  Woodpeckers have a small, tight brain case. Having very little room for the brain limits how much the brain can move within the skull. This limit of motion keeps the brain from slamming into the skull lowering risk of concussion.  Behavioral adaptations  Woodpeckers vary where they peck. They aren't pecking at the same spot the entire time. This variation spreads things out a little, not hitting the same spot over and over again which minimizes the damage to the brain and skull in one area."

Some studies link their brain structure to foxes, while other have found similarity in the structure of their chromosomes close to felines! They are weird and quite possibly ancient creatures. However, while they are certainly primitive canids, they are not in the same genus as dogs and therefore cannot be called and early species of dog. I have changed your post's flair to clarify."
Awwducational,3apjoi,remotectrl,30,Mon Jun 22 21:14:36 2015 UTC,"This title is incredibly misleading. A raccoon dog is not a dog as we know it - it's not a member of the Canis genus.   It's in the same family as modern dogs, but was never domesticated and is not an ancestor of modern dogs whatsoever, so calling it ""one of the earliest species of dog"" would be like saying foxes are small, hoppy dogs. Saying it's one of the earliest species of canine is true, but it doesn't fall under the classification of ""dog"".  TL;DR: I may be downvoted, but raccoon dog =/= dog. Canine =/= dog. The old math word problem stating ""all x are y, but not all y are x"" stands true here. All dogs are canines, not all canines are dogs. Raccoon dogs are canines, but not dogs."

Awwducational,3almwi,scrappyisachamp,54,Sun Jun 21 14:48:38 2015 UTC,"They're pretty much living works of art.   I read they got this way because resources are so abundant where they live that the females don't need any help from the males to raise the offspring, so they're only valued for how impressive they look (and for their awesome dancing skills). Also, the abundant resources make it possible for the males to use a lot of the energy they get from food for their aesthetics, because they aren't as pressured by their environment to survive as other species are.   Speaking of survival, they probably don't have many or any predators, which is why they can afford to look so eye-catching (as opposed to camouflaged), but I might be wrong on that."

Awwducational,3abgk0,Alantha,70,Thu Jun 18 19:13:24 2015 UTC,I train honeybees to associate sugar water with various odors. AMA.
Awwducational,3abgk0,Apiphilia,22,Fri Jun 19 00:38:09 2015 UTC,I'd love to know more about your research and I'm sure our subscribers would as well. Can you give us a synopsis of your work?
Awwducational,3abgk0,Apiphilia,43,Fri Jun 19 01:24:45 2015 UTC,"I train bees to stick out their proboscis (tongue) in response to different odors. Bees have an reflexive response to stick their proboscis out when their antenna are touched by sugar water. So if you pair sugar water on the antenna with the odors a couple times, the bee will associate the two and start extending her proboscis to the smell alone. We also let them eat the sugar water.   I have to train individual bees (usually in batches of 10). This method increases the likelihood of each bee learning, but would be very inefficient for something like finding land mines where you'd want to train very large numbers of bees.  The learning isn't actually the target of my research, but more of a first step. Once I've trained the bees, I usually give them a choice between the learned odor and a novel odor and I see how different nutritional states change their choices."
Awwducational,3abgk0,Apiphilia,18,Fri Jun 19 02:00:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, really fascinating! Thank you. I have a few questions if you don't mind:   Where (county/state) is your research being done? How much exposure do the bees need before the association sticks?  What have the outcomes of your research shown?  What type of sugar do you use; glucose, fructose, etc?  What species of bee are you working with? Recently I've read about bees preferring pesticide treated plants. What are your thoughts on this?   And again thank you for your comment AMA!"
Awwducational,3abgk0,Sophophilic,26,Fri Jun 19 02:33:41 2015 UTC,"I work with Apis mellifera (mostly Italians) in Colorado (USA). We use sucrose in our conditioning.   The method I used is usually referred to as Proboscis Extension Response (PER) and is used quite a bit. Bees can form some association after only 1 conditioning trial, but the memory is less stable and fewer bees will learn. We use 6 trials per odor (sometimes we condition them to 2 odors at once). That number works well for us, a fair number of people only do 3 trials (and as I said 1 can work).   I've been looking at how nutritional condition changes foraging decisions. A lot of it boils down to a trade-off between exploring for new food patches and exploiting (eating at) known food patches. I've been testing the hypothesis that animals should be more likely to explore when they are well fed and more likely to exploit when they are poorly fed. This strategy would allow the animal to focus on gathering information when they are most energetically able to afford it.   My first experiment found that honeybees do act as hypothesized when fed or starved before a choice test. This has just been published, if you're extra interested, PM me and I can send you a copy. More recent work implies that bees follow the same pattern if their colony is food-poor or food-rich even when they've been removed form the colony (unpublished data).   There has been a lot of work on bees and pesticides lately, so its hard to know exactly what you're referring to, but its very reasonable to believe that some pesticides could be an attractant for bees and that others would deter them. If you could point me to a specific work, or at least a specific pesticide, I might be able to take a firmer stance."

This method increases the likelihood of each bee learning, but would be very inefficient for something like finding land mines where you'd want to train very large numbers of bees.   Couldn't you attach something to the bee and then use that to find the landmine? You know, like some sort of beecon?"
Awwducational,3abgk0,Buffalo__Buffalo,8,Fri Jun 19 11:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, you could. People have recently started using harmonic radar tags to track foraging bees. My lab doesn't use them, because they're really expensive. These would allow you to follow a single bee to a landmine. I'd still say that a group of bees would be better when working with something like landmines, simply because learning is never perfect. Even smart kids don't always get 100% on their tests, but if you take 100 smart kids, whatever the majority of them picked is very likely to be the correct answer. The same idea would work with bees, even if you just have average learners, if you have a lot you can be pretty sure they got it right."

Awwducational,3a2347,Alantha,14,Tue Jun 16 17:01:24 2015 UTC,"I wonder if aggression ties into it as well. Chimpanzees are generally considered more aggressive animals than bonobos, which might go along with bonobos having more social partners, which might go along with chimpanzees being more ""object-oriented"".  I mean, probably not, but I figured I'd throw it out there."
Awwducational,3a2347,Hedgehogs4Me,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:04:23 2015 UTC,Do correct me if I'm wrong. I think Dawkins in 'Ancestor's Tale' (or was it Gribbin's 'The Redundant Male'?) linked primate aggressiveness to sexual promiscuity and size of testes. As in - where sexual relationships are closer to being monogamous there is less need for aggression to avoid being cuckolded; as well as less need to go on a crazy insemination spree (hence smaller testes). Tying tool usage into this would certainly be interesting...
Awwducational,3a2347,ohpollux,4,Tue Jun 16 21:28:15 2015 UTC,"That sounds logical enough, although I'm not nearly as well-read as you are (in fact, I can't remember the last time I read anything about biology at all).  Are bonobo relationships really closer to being monogamous than chimpanzee relationships? I was under the impression that bonobos socially treat sex not too far off from how a handshake is treated to humans - very casually and not discriminating much between different individuals. Would that not then suggest that they should be much more aggressive?"
Awwducational,3a2347,Hedgehogs4Me,3,Tue Jun 16 21:42:30 2015 UTC,"Ah right, my bad, you are totally right about bonobo's sexual relationships. I don't know how I missed this.   A quick google search (and I'm going to regret using an indexed search, aren't I?) showed that chimpanzees and bonobos have a roughly similar body to testicle size ratio. So perhaps it's something else? Like the type of relationships. Another quick search seems to show that chimpanzees are polygamous and bonobos seem to be polyamorous. I wonder if there's a connection there. Like, there's still the need to impregnate left and right to be sure to propagate your DNA, but because a single male can have sex with many females and a single female with many males - there is no point in being territorial and aggressive? I don't know, I'm making assumptions here...   I will try and look it up properly with some references tomorrow and get back to you if no one else does."
Awwducational,3a2347,ohpollux,2,Tue Jun 16 22:17:20 2015 UTC,"So the promised follow-up. I was misremembering a point in the book. Unfortunately it isn't mentioning bonobo's aggressiveness, I was jumping to conclusions. But here's the quote all the same:   ""...Our closest relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos, have extremely large testes. They are not polygynous like gorillas, nor are they monogamous like gibbons. Female chimpanzees in oestrus normally copulate with more than one male. This promiscuous mating pattern is not polyandry, which means the stable bonding of one female with more than one male. It does not predict any simple pattern of sexual dimorphism. But it did suggest to the British biologist Roger Short an explanation for the large testes: chimpanzee genes have been passed down the generations via spermatozoa that had to battle it out in competition with rival sperms from several males inside the same female. In such a world, sheer numbers of spermatozoa matter, and this demands big testes. Male gorillas, on the other hand, have small testes but powerful shoulders and huge resonating chests. Gorilla genes do their competing via male fights and chest-thumping threats to win females. Chimpanzees compete via sperm proxies inside vaginas. This is why gorillas have pronounced sexual dimorphism and small testes, while chimpanzees have large testes and weak sexual dimorphism.""  I guess in comparison with gorillas chimpanzees aren't really that aggressive.   Here's, however, another quote from the same book (which is in itself a quote of the primatologist Frans de Waal) that might provide at least a tiny bit of satisfaction on the subject: ""The chimpanzee resolves sexual issues with power; the bonobo resolves power issues with sex..."".  Both quotes are from Richard Dawkins' book 'The Ancestor's Tale'. The first quote can be found in the chapter called 'The Seal's Tale', the second in 'The Bonobo's Tale'."
Awwducational,3a2347,ohpollux,2,Wed Jun 17 19:48:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the follow-up. I'm going to now engage in shameless layman speculation.  I feel like with gorillas vs chimpanzees we start to enter the territory of aggressive against who. From what I understand, male gorillas can be very hostile toward each other, especially when mating is on the line, but chimps seem to be somewhat aggressive toward everything. This seems logical when comparing mating patterns of gorillas to those of chimps - males compete with each other for mates, so that a male ""wins"" a female in an organized way, not necessitating extra aggression at other times, while, according to the passage you quoted, male chimps don't ever seem to ""win"" a female at all, so while general aggression toward others may still be useful for being more sure of reproducing, there is no specific time that the aggression is scheduled to take place, so there's no specific target of the aggressive behaviour any any given time.  In other words, chimpanzees' secret is that they're always angry."
Awwducational,3a2347,Hedgehogs4Me,2,Wed Jun 17 20:00:05 2015 UTC,"Sure thing.   That certainly sounds plausible. In fact, you've reminded me of a passage I've read in another book. I even managed to find it :) I think it's sort of similar to your point.   Gorillas: ""The gorilla troop is the domain of a dominant male who, because of the grey hair that covers his back and flanks, is known as a silverback. The silverback, with his enormous crested skull, is physically much more imposing than his females; he is 30 per cent taller and almost twice as heavy as his females. A successful silverback attracts young females to join his harem, and patrols a home range in which other male gorillas are not welcome. Certainly no adult male other than the dominant silverback ever gets close enough to the females of the troop to sire offspring. So gorilla father suffer no great uncertainty about the paternity of their children, and are evolutionarily happy to invest in their well-being...  ...The silverback, in exchange for his protection, enjoys exclusive access to those females for breeding...""  Chimpanzees: ""...When a female chimp comes on heat she develops a visual signal, a swollen bottom, and emits powerful scents, pheromones, that attract males from miles around. One male may, if he is persistent and lucky, and if she co-operates by keeping quiet, succeed in taking the female off for a few days on what primatologists call a consortship. He will try to keep her away from other males and will mount her as often as he can during this time. Being a consort must be quite a successful strategy because studies in the wild reveal that about half of all chimpanzees are conceived when their mothers have a consort. The other males seem to know this too, and will often attack a consort when he rejoins the group. In any event, while consortships account for half of all newborn chimpanzees, the remainder are conceived as a result of male behavior that can best be described as a gang bang...  ...For a period of a few days, while the female is on heat, there is total chaos, during which the female will have been mounted several times by each male in the troop...""  Both quotes from 'The Redundant Male' by Jeremy Cherfas and John Gribbin.   Sorry, I just couldn't resist doing a flood of quotes."
Awwducational,3a2347,ohpollux,2,Wed Jun 17 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"What I got out of this is that chimpanzees evolved to reproduce in numbers, while gorillas evolved to reproduce based on size and strength? It's kind of a nerd vs brute correlation, it seems."

I'm sure we have all seen the opening scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey where the humans first use tools as a means of aggression. If we just had sex every time we had to resolve an issue, we would accomplish nothing. It is indeed the struggle that produces innovation. Chimps had to get a one up on others in order to mate, eat, and whatever else, As a result they have tool use."

Awwducational,39kwjq,CommanderBC,2,Sat Jun 13 00:26:10 2015 UTC,"It's really cool to learn more about other animals on our planet, especially when we find out that they are more sophisticated than we already thought (and generally, we tend to regard elephants as pretty smart for animals).   But they're not intelligent like we are. Or perhaps more accurately, they're not intelligent to the degree that we are. They are far more than dumb beasts but they aren't our equals. Communication may be possible but conversation probably isn't.  Not to mention that intelligent life from another world making contact would be exciting in a whole range of ways - it would be truly alien, it would require them to be at least comparable if not superior to us in intellect and it would mean our planet isn't alone in harboring life, intelligent life.  I mean, I'm right there with you in thinking we should be spending more effort in understanding life on our planet and the myriad ways it is formed and approaches the world. It's really fascinating and it helps us understand ourselves better to see how other animals approach things.  But it's not the same thing as a search for extra-terrestrial life. That search is trying to answer different questions. Independently important questions for our species."
Awwducational,39kwjq,kites47,2,Sat Jun 13 02:24:03 2015 UTC,Completely agree! Although I think other animals might be really intelligent in other ways than we expect.  On the alien topic. Not a chance in hell we are going to find intelligent alien life. Maybe life on a cellular level. But if there is intelligent life out there it is going to find and contact us long before we would find them.

Important to note that I don't believe it's Aristotle the philosopher, though I'm not entirely certain of that. I was wrong, see below! The concept of them being extremely intelligent is largely due to the multitude of papers demonstrating their intelligence since at least the 1950s. This means that most people today would be familiar with their intelligence, rather than the ""stupid"" motion as above.  I found it just as surprising as you!"

Lobotomies aren't quite comparable. The basic idea isn't crazy, it's just a little too heavy handed."

I'm just saying that for someone who lived centuries ago, Aristotle was pretty scientifically advanced. There were a lot of other scientific views around Aristotle's time that circled around specific body parts or liquids (the four humours) impacting our behaviours. I don't think the wandering womb was that crazy in that time period.  What you're saying is pretty indicative of hindsight bias. His views only seem crazy because we have long ago  disproved then and our scientific advancements allow for us to view things in a much more critical way."

He lived and died long before the scientific method.  He was a great thinker, and came up with many interesting ideas, but I really dislike it when people act as though the ancient Greeks did ""science"".  They did not (with perhaps one or two exceptions.)  They did make a few very interesting discoveries that modern science later built on, but their errors and their bizarre ideas (unfounded in any form of observation, testing, or anything that resembles modern science) were far more numerous.

I tend to think of science as something of a ""chain,"" where each student learns from a teacher, who in turn likely learned from someone else, and so on. Now there are obviously a lot of parts of science that you consider to be extremely simple, such as the pythagorean theorem. But understand that there was a point in time where someone who had no understanding of that theorem had to actually ""invent"" it (it probably wasn't Pythagorus btw, we see it used on clay tablets in the Old Babylonian period). Yes they had a lot of theories that were wrong, but do you believe that every theory you hold to be true today will never be disproved? There are very large portions of the universe which we have not even had a chance to explore yet. Do you think with another 2000 years of observation that someone will write of 2015 science that ""They did make a few very interesting discoveries that modern science later built on, but their errors and their bizarre ideas... were far more numerous""?

Awwducational,39fr9r,BrookeStardust,15,Thu Jun 11 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"Source. Please comment below if you can't access it for some reason. The article is from Biol. Bull. June 2006 vol. 210 no. 3 308-317.   Some choice quotes from the authors:  In summary, there has been an impressive amount of research over the last 50 years on the learning capabilities of octopuses; by our count, about 200 papers on different aspects of learning of O. vulgaris appeared between 1950 and 1980.    Possibly exceeding the level of functional specificity of the vertebrate brain, specific areas in the octopus brain are dedicated to learning and memory. In particular, the [Vertical Lobe] appears essential for long-term learning and memory, a role first revealed in lesion experiments by Boycott and Young (1955a) and Maldonado (1965) (see also Wells, 1978; Young, 1991). Removal of the VL did not appear to affect the behavior of the animal; the lesioned animals stayed in their homes, came out to attack crabs, ate, walked, and swam normally. Similarly, stimulating the VL or the superior frontal lobes of animals produced no obvious effects, whereas stimulating other parts of the brain caused movements of some part of the body. Stimulation and lesions produced similar results in cuttlefish (Boycott, 1961). Thus, the vertical and superior frontal lobes do not seem to be engaged in any basic motor functions.    The nervous system of this invertebrate does not consist of “a small number of large identifiable neurons,” nor is it “amenable to genetic manipulation”—properties that make some invertebrates ideal for studying general questions in neurobiology. On the contrary, our interest in this unique invertebrate is based on its well-documented complex behavioral repertoires that we and others have shown to be comparable to those of vertebrates.

Rats are nocturnal creatures and consequently aren't as resistant to the sun as many creatures are. Their tails and ears are particularly vulnerable as they are not protected by a layer of fur so we apply a factor 30 suncream to protect their delicate areas. Another precaution we take is that the rats begin work early in the morning, often around 6pm and only work for a couple of hours max."

Instead stating the name for the fruit is more a marketing move to avoid association with China.    Sometime in the 1960s, kiwifruit farmers in New Zealand decided to market the fruit overseas, but decided to give them another name, to avoid confusion. (Remember also that mainland China was very much out of favour with the West at that time.) To help identify the fruit with New Zealand, the name ""kiwifruit"" was chosen.   I am tagging this post as partly true."

He was a virgin until now, but for two to three weeks, this little lothario goes at it non-stop. He mates with as many females as he can, in violent, frenetic encounters that can each last up to 14 hours. He does little else.  A month ago, he irreversibly stopped making sperm, so he’s got all that he will ever have. This burst of speed-mating is his one chance to pass his genes on to the next generation, and he will die trying. He exhausts himself so thoroughly that his body starts to fall apart. His blood courses with testosterone and stress hormones. His fur falls off. He bleeds internally. His immune system fails to fight off incoming infections, and he becomes riddled with gangrene.  He’s a complete mess, but he’s still after sex. “By the end of the mating season, physically disintegrating males may run around frantically searching for last mating opportunities,” says Diana Fisher from the University of Queensland. “By that time, females are, not surprisingly, avoiding them.” Sourced originally from National Geographic."

Awwducational,382gmt,baween,227,Mon Jun 1 11:14:00 2015 UTC,"As a note here, the dogs were killed by Mounties to fight the spread of infectious disease (distemper, hepatitis and rabies) within the Inuit community. This was nothing malicious.   There were also four other events which lead to the decline in population of this breed of dog (some of these were malicious in nature):  Event 2: changes in cultural practices; the Inuit in the 1950's and 60's moved into settlements and were often unable to successfully combine settlement living with regular hunting for food for themselves and their dogs. Fewer full-time hunters meant fewer dog teams.   Event 3: the disappearance or killing of Inuit dog teams owned by Inuit sent south for healthcare, usually tuberculosis treatment. Some teams were given to the family members responsible for caring for their dependents; other teams were killed or unharnessed with the dogs left to fend for themselves. When an Inuk returned from treatment, he was often unable to re-establish his dog team and hunt again.  Event 4: killing dogs perceived (primarily by non-Inuit) to be a nuisance or danger to people in settlements.  Event 5: the killing of Inuit dogs as individual acts of intimidation by Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers. The RCMP had a limited number of options available to control Inuit or punish individuals breaking laws or Qallunaat cultural expectations. Police detachments were few and small and Inuit traveled in family groups. Threatening to kill dogs was a particularly easy method to get Inuit to comply with orders, whether the orders were reasonable or not."
Awwducational,382gmt,c8lou,87,Mon Jun 1 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"*There are claims amongst the Inuit that the killings were done dangerously and as a deliberate attempt to intimidate the Inuit.

Awwducational,382gmt,eidetic,36,Mon Jun 1 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"Given that the government took First Nation children from their families and sent them to residential schools, and did things like giving families permission to pick up their children for Christmas (with rules on how/when), I find it pretty easy to believe that the RCMP would use killing sled dogs as leverage."

Oh, and the use of Inuit as human flagpoles! That was bad. But don't worry - we're only dealing with 49 dead Rangers since 2011 despite the largely Inuit force not being in any theatre of war.

Awwducational,382gmt,eidetic,15,Mon Jun 1 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"Two different occasions I'm referencing here. The first was the Cold War project to move Inuit families to distant northern islands so as to prevent Soviet activity in the North. Of course, Canada basically ripped Inuit families apart and then left some 87 people to starve in the High Arctic under the justification that it was a humanitarian program.   The second is a recent report coming from the Canadian Rangers program, a military sovereign patrol body (i.e.: a military force that exists to maintain national control of sparsely-populated territories). These guys are using Lee-Enfields from 1941, for Christ's sake. At any rate, the CBC recently sounded the alarm about the deaths and the poor equipment of the Canadian Rangers."
Awwducational,382gmt,AbsoluteZeroK,5,Mon Jun 1 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"Some further questions, if you don't mind.  12 days pay each year?  Am I reading that right?  How and why are they only paid for 12 days?  Surely they work more than 12 days a year?  I dunno, maybe I haven't done enough reading on this yet, but it seems like given the number of Rangers and their responsibilities, along with the sheer area they cover, there's no way they are only doing 12 days of work a year.  Or are they?  10 days of training also doesn't seem that adequate.  I'm sure many if not the vast majority grew up in the far north, and thus have learned how to survive up there for the most part before becoming Rangers, but 10 days doesn't seem like that much, even if they're not expected to deploy to combat areas.  Their wide range of responsibilities, some of which individually I'd expect could take 10 days of training alone, makes the number seem low and inadequate.  Is this low amount of training considered to be a big factor in a lot of the deaths?  Just seems to me if they are only receiving 10 days training, and if the individual Rangers are only putting in 12 days of work a year, the government and the people would be better served perhaps by having a smaller, but more dedicated force to handle the Rangers' responsibilities.  By ""more dedicated"", I certainly don't mean that the Rangers are anything other than dedicated, you kind of have to be dedicated to do such a job, but I mean it in a more ""full time and specifically focused"" sense.  Kind of like the difference between a dedicated, full time firefighting department, versus a volunteer reserve firefighting force.  Sorry for all the questions, I do plan on looking into it more on my own so don't feel compelled to go out or your way to answer them, I just asked here in case others are interested and also because you (or others) might be able to jump start my research and put me on the right track."
Awwducational,382gmt,c8lou,9,Mon Jun 1 23:28:16 2015 UTC,"Not at all! I'm happy to do my best!  Basically, the Canadian government has a problem with the Inuit because they really don't fit in well with what Canada does best - mindless, pants-on-head resource extraction. This extractive economic model (which is, I may add, fundamentally colonial in nature) has been the bane of Canada's economic and political health from the days of Harold Innis, the first political theorist to name the phenomenon. He called it the Staples Thesis, and the Staples Thesis basically prevents Canada from seeing the North as anything more than a vast space for potential economic activity.  Another problem comes from the fact that Canada effectively has a Jim-Crow bureaucracy set up for Metis, First Nations, and Inuit people. They have to go through the Department of Indian Affairs (or whatever they're calling themselves this week: they change names more often than a Vegas bride), which is an antiquated and frankly inexcusably Soviet apparatus. This in conjunction with the extremely limited political representation that the Territories have federally (1 seat each in the House of Commons) means that the Inuit have a hard time having their voices heard.  Finally, the Canadian Armed Forces have taken massive budget bops over the years. Jean Chretien merged the Coast Guard into the Department of Fisheries and Oceans so as to hide millions in cuts (it's practically vogue to slash DFO because it doesn't directly affect the majority of the electorate), and Stephen Harper has kept the slippery tradition alive in the form of enforcing cuts through back-door measures. One of the more rotten is by planning to spend a certain amount and then pulling the funding: this means that it looks like the department has found huge savings, but in reality they simply didn't buy something that they needed. It would be like if a father gave his kid $20 to buy a video game but demanded that the kid bring $15 back in change.  So, the rolling effect of this is a catastrophe. Indian Affairs is incoherent and the Inuit have a hard time being heard because of it; the Inuit are on the whole eager to keep resource extraction out of the North (thus putting them at odds with Ottawa); and the military is getting ninja-gutted anywhere that the PR isn't too ugly. Given that Canada generally doesn't think about the non-settlers, the Canadian Rangers are an easy target for cuts. They can't say anything about it because the South doesn't care, they have nobody to complain to anyways because of federal incompetence, and they're non-settlers so they can be ignored.   This results in the mess you see before you. Underpaid and with half of their training staff burned out and stressed beyond belief, the Canadian Rangers are basically getting kneecapped at every opportunity and then used as photo-op backdrops."
Awwducational,382gmt,c8lou,4,Mon Jun 1 23:43:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for the info.  I actually started looking into and was seriously left wondering WTF during a lot of it.  At first I thought you were using the term flagpole as a kind of hazing or punishment sense, since here in the states at least, it can sometimes refer to making someone stand very still for a very long time, like, well, a flagpole.  Combined with the death toll, I thought maybe there was some kind institutionalized hazing going on against the native members of the Rangers, that resulted in a lot of deaths.  I do have to ask though about the Lee Enfield rifles.  What exactly is the problem with them?  Bolt action rifles, even those built in the 1940s are sometimes better suited for such enclvironments and types of work.  I admit I haven't looked into this much at all, so please forgive my ignorance, but is it that they really need new equipment, or just want it?  I could see if they're deployed to combat zones needing newer and more suitable guns, but a reliable bolt action sounds like just the thing for the far north, unless of course they're actually running into situations where you need something more.  Please note I'm not trying to sound like I'm suggesting they are acting entitled to newer weapons, but I'm kind of wondering if it's more of the media making it out to be a bigger issue (such as, ""omg, a 1940s gun can't possibly be suitable!), or are the Rangers themselves the ones asking for them?  Because if it's the former, the media often doesn't know anything about guns, but if it's the latter, well, I'd definitely take their word and rely on their expertise to say what they need, and if they say they need something, they would know better than anyone!"
Awwducational,382gmt,AbsoluteZeroK,5,Mon Jun 1 23:09:42 2015 UTC,"The problem with the Lee-Enfield is parts and repairs. They aren't as easy to fix as you think and the parts are getting hard to find. If they didn't use them for hunting it wouldn't be a problem, and if they weren't in the middle of nowhere it wouldn't be so bad to get the parts up North. But they do and they are, so the Lee-Enfield becomes a problem. There have been plans for years to get them new guns (which they have mentioned wanting), but the Canadian government is nothing if not painfully slow."
Awwducational,382gmt,anonlymouse,6,Mon Jun 1 23:15:40 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, that is exactly the kind of thing I was wondering about.  I should mention my knowledge on specific guns, including their Lee Enfields, is often lacking.  I also hadn't considered the issue of getting replacement parts and such.  While such things may not be issues for collectors who often prize such kinds of rifles, it is quite a different story when one can quite literally depend on their rifle, as opposed to someone using it for sport, recreational vs subsistence hunting, etc.  As kind of an example as to why I was wondering if it was more of the media creating something out of nothing or if the Rangers themselves had actually requested them, I once read an op-ed piece awhile back about the state of equipment being used by the military in the invasion of Iraq.  While they certainly were all too often poorly and under equipped, the article writer also said something along the lines of ""even their snipers, those who are some of the most highly trained and valuable individuals on the battlefield, are going to Iraq with bolt action rifles, a design in use since WWI.""  Now, he didn't mention what kind of rifles, or even what kind of snipers he was referring to, but the generalized statement and it's premise was rather absurd I'm sure you'll agree, even if there were sniper units being deployed with less than ideal weapons.  If he had mentioned a specific rifle that genuinely was obsolete or otherwise ill suited for the task, he might have had a point.  But the premise he put forth, or at least the way it came across, was that the rifles were obsolete simply because they were bolt action, even though some bolt action rifles are still the design of choice for certain types of sniper roles.  He also said something to the effect of the standard issue assault rifle, the M16 and M4, being a flawed design that cost many soldiers their lives in Vietnam.  While the M16 certainly had many issues in its infancy, and even after, and it's descendants may still be lacking in some ways, his entire premise was rather flawed again, since the modern incarnations are a completely different beast from the early models.  Those kind of things, along with the media constantly not knowing the differences between assault rifles, machine guns, submachine guns, semi automatic guns, etc, was why I was curious as to whether it was a real issue or one manufactured by the media."
Awwducational,382gmt,erasmosis,5,Mon Jun 1 23:52:05 2015 UTC,"OOooH! I follow!  Short answer: no, it isn't a media thing really. We actually see very little of the North save for perfectly-framed shots of Iqaluit or generic helicopter fly-bys of generic-looking settlements in and amongst a bunch of icebergs. Though the Lee-Enfield is an ideal weapon it simply is getting to be too much of a hassle to repair. The government said that the next gun is likely to be very much like the Lee-Enfield but with modern parts. Since both of those were mentioned in the report from a newspaper of record (the Globe and Mail may be a rag, but it is a newspaper of record), I'd venture that it wasn't hype.   That said, it wasn't a topic of conversation here at all. Anglo-Canadians tend to not think much about the North."
Awwducational,382gmt,KPKSDST,3,Mon Jun 1 23:57:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the RCMP were using it as leverage, more so the government. If you're a police officer, and the minister in charge of the environment says ""Hey, we've gotta kill some of these dogs, because they are spreading all kinds of diseases, and it's killing people"". You're probably just gonna say ""Oh darn, well looks like I've gotta kill some of these dogs, so the people in this community don't get sick""."
Awwducational,382gmt,erasmosis,10,Mon Jun 1 19:51:21 2015 UTC,"This is really where the lack of documentation causes problems. We know that the RCMP rarely followed the laws from their own internal investigation, and we do know that the Inuit didn't have the cull explained to them before it happened.   But we don't know what RCMP Officer Smith was thinking when he put a dog down. Or what that dog was like - was it really sick? Could it have gotten better? Were the RCMP acting spitefully? Were they truly of the belief that they were upholding the law? Did they love the dogs and cry at the constabulary after having to shoot a qimmiq? We don't know. I suspect instances of all of the above are a part of the story, but what matters most is bringing the species back and being honest about Canada's historical relationship to the Inuit, which is criminally forgotten."
Awwducational,382gmt,mermaidunicornhybrid,8,Mon Jun 1 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"Being honest about Canada's relationship with the Inuit is pretty important in the interpretation here. For all I know (I haven't done a huge amount of research on it, so I won't even say we), the government saw a way of eliminating a tool by which the Inuit participated in a traditional, nomadic lifestyle. If Canada over exaggerated distemper to wipe out as many dogs as possible, it would only further their goals of assimilation. This would not surprise me in any way shape or form."
Awwducational,382gmt,brritney,7,Mon Jun 1 21:49:06 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Canada's history regarding the Inuit is horrific - human zoos, dehumanization, and active attempts at assimilation.

Yeah, that's Mackenzie's baby too. Oh, yeah. And the Parliament buildings. Those are him too. I'm not kidding you.   He's easily the better man of him and the genocidal, corrupt drunkard John Macdonald.

Humans are most notably affected by HSV1 and HSV2 (cold sores and genital terror), Epstein-Barr virus (Mono), Varicella Zoster (chicken pox and shingles), and cytomegalovirus. Pretty much every human being is affected by one or more of these herpesviruses, but this represents a small percentage of all the herpes viruses out there infecting other animals."

Awwducational,384lhx,AGreatWind,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:26:09 2015 UTC,"Here is a cutaway image of a herpes simplex virion. This image was produced using cryo electron tomography and in itself was worthy of publication in Science in 2003. The blue part of the image is the capsid shell, here is where the virus keeps its DNA. The orange bit is strange and is called the tegument. It's a weird unstructured glob of 18 different viral proteins and may carry readymade bits of RNA and the Viral host shutoff protein (VHS) which degrades the host cells mRNA. The yellow is the envelope derived from a previous host's cell membrane and studded with glycoproteins that attach and fuse with cells.  Herpes establishes two kinds of infection: active and latent. Active is like most other viruses -the virus infects cells, replicates, destroys cells, repeats. Fast and destructive.  Latent infection is much more interesting, and unnerving. After initial infection some virus particles travel to nerve cells and enter. They travel up the axon and merge with the cell nucleus. The virus's DNA then forms a circular ring called an episome with attaches to the nerve cells DNA. As the cells DNA is replicated, so is the viruses DNA. but not the whole virus. Virus is not detected in these cells under examination. The virus (or parts of the virus genome more accurately) is in full stealth mode -it doesn't quite exist as a virus yet. This is a slow and non-destructive infection and lasts for the life of the host. Occasionally the virus is activated, forms, and goes for a tear through the host again. Creepy little bugger. (Source: Fields, Ch.60)  Herpes (HSV) is not my bug. Something about it give me the willies; I much prefer studying ebola or lassa. Still pretty neat though!"

Awwducational,37l21j,anonlymouse,16,Thu May 28 16:38:11 2015 UTC,"So to begin, we are just talking about brown bears and black bears. Brown bears and Grizzlies are the same animal, the main difference in layman's terms here in Alaska is that brown bears live on the coast and grow to be much bigger, and grizzlies live in the interior and can be smaller. (It's a diet thing.)  I'll give you a list of differences in descending order from what you'd want to check, when say you see one in the distant in the wild to figure out what exactly you're seeing.    Now, to tell the difference between the two species, generally you can tell the difference between the species based off of coloration, but in some cases, like this picture, it is hard to see. (Brown bears tend to be brown or cinnamon colored, black bears tend to be black. This is not always the case in both species, so we then go further down the list.) Size is also another sign, adult brown bears generally are much larger than black bears, but again this is not always the case.  The next thing you'll try and notice is that brown bears generally have a large hump They are built to dig for roots and creatures just below the ground. Their shoulder muscles have adapted to such and they have developed this large shoulder hump that black bears don't have. Now, another way to tell is their face. Brown bears have a particularly round face with round ears while black bears have a narrow face and more pointy ears If, for whatever reason, you're close enough to examine their claws, a brown bear's are long and straight and lighter, made for digging. The black bear's are short and curved and made for climbing. Now, you can also identify the different species of bears by their footprint. Brown bears claws are long enough that you are able to draw a straight line between all of their claws and the pads of their feet. Whereas the black bear's claws are short and curved, and you aren't able to do that.    That's the major difference's in looks, to help identify the different species out in the wild. Now remember, if you come into any hostile contact with any bear, this simple rhyme (after you identify the species) might save your life.   If its black (bear) fight back, and if its brown (bear) stay down.   Hope I helped with the confusion!"
Awwducational,37l21j,remotectrl,5,Thu May 28 19:09:59 2015 UTC,"If its black (bear) fight back, and if its brown (bear) stay down.   I was taught the opposite, that blacks will leave you alone if you play dead but grizzlies will eat carcasses. If anyone in the community spotted a grizzly anywhere near we just didn't go anywhere without the dog and didn't go far from the house or barn if we didn't need to."
Awwducational,37l21j,anonlymouse,7,Thu May 28 20:02:15 2015 UTC,"Well, let's look at size first.   Brown bears can weigh up to 1400 pounds (on average.)  Black bears can weigh up to 350 pounds (on average.)   Just with size alone its a no brainer which one I'd rather fight. (The correct answer is neither, but I know which is the lesser ""evil."")  Either case, an attack is something to be avoided and can be done, in almost all instances.   Bear attacks are incredibly rare. However, statistically speaking, brown bears attack more frequently than black bears do.   Black bears, the smaller species generally give humans a wide berth. (As do brown bears.) Black bears, possibly due to there size and habitat generally do have more interactions with human society. In my city, Anchorage, which happens to be the largest in Alaska, we have 200-300 black bears living within city limits, and an estimated 40 brown bears, as an example.   Black bears would almost always prefer to run from human interaction than anything else. They are the smaller bear and are not hunters of large game. I've gone out onto my porch to yell at black bears to scare them away, which generally works. (Not something I'd do with a brown bear.)   Looking at bear attacks throughout the years you can see two things. But before we look into that we need to understand that there is always outliers out there, these instances are not always the case.  Black bears generally attack when they have become to feeding due to humans, (trash or whatnot) and when that food is no longer available. (Reasons we say a trash bear is a dead bear, can't keep them around because they become WAY more of a liability.) OR because they have become malnourished/sick/desperate for food.   Either case a black bear is more likely to take the risk into attacking a ""large"" animal like a human when it is desperate for food.   Black bear maulings, while less frequent than brown bears, result in a higher statistic of feeding on the body than brown bears do. It is important to note that there is more instances of brown bears feeding on humans than black bears, just because of the much higher number of recorded maulings. Statistically speaking however, black bears are the higher threat of human consumption.   Brown bears are unaccustomed to running from anything. They are the big bad creatures of their habitat. They are also unaccustomed to creatures that challenge them. Brown bear attacks generally come from surprising a mother and cubs, or that the bear feels threatened by you in some way. It needs to put down the threat.  So first off, just by size alone, I'd rather fight a black bear than a brown bear. Secondly, although the much rarer attacks between the two rare instances already, the fact that a larger percentage of black bears feeding on their mauling victims makes me want to try and fight back to end the attack even more so. And lastly, when brown bears generally are just putting down a threat, the more you struggle and fight the more the threat continues to be there.   So first, avoid a physical encounter with a bear, but if a mauling were to happen, as a last resort, attack the nose, eyes, neck and just about anything on a black bear and cover your neck and attempt the fetal position until its all over with a brown bear.  Of course, this is all easier said then done. Just please, don't run.   tl;dr I promise, with size alone, and even with mauling statistics, fight back against a black bear and play dead against a brown bear."
Awwducational,37l21j,DingoManDingo,12,Thu May 28 21:27:12 2015 UTC,"My own handy identification method is to climb a tree.  If it comes up after you, it was a black bear.  If it knocks the tree over to get you, it was a brown bear.  If there are no trees anywhere, it was a polar bear."
Awwducational,37l21j,onering,2,Thu May 28 23:58:36 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking trash might be the difference, we never had trash out, nor did anyone else in the area. Don't recall seeing a trash bin outside at anyone's house, and we certainly never had a case of a bear (or any other animal for that matter) being accustomed to eating trash.  We only had blacks attacking because they were afraid, either because you were between the mother and her cubs or because you got aggressive. Never had any blacks feeding on people after they attacked them.  Grizzlies on the other hand would see you as food, lying down just makes you an easy meal. Whereas standing your ground, making yourself larger and yelling at it makes it reconsider whether it's worth getting injured just to eat you or if it's better off finding a meal elsewhere."
Awwducational,37l21j,yoat,1 point,Thu May 28 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect. I was taught in boy scouts that it was the other way around. A black bear might back down if you fight back, but a brown bear will destroy you so it'd best to curl up in a ball and try to protect your head and neck and hope it gets tired/decides you aren't a threat to its cubs. Most wildlife, unless it has been acclimated to human presence, will prefer to leave you alone unless they see you as a threat to themselves or their young."
Awwducational,37l21j,remotectrl,0,Fri May 29 05:54:48 2015 UTC,"A grizzly won't get tired. They'll keep at you for hours, trying to drag you out of a tree you managed to climb up or breaking into the house you barricaded yourself into. While a black bear won't attack you in the first place if you don't give it reason to."
Awwducational,37l21j,Kapoi,4,Fri May 29 07:02:34 2015 UTC,I could tell by looking at that bear that it was either a really young grizzly or not one at all. The face is different.

Awwducational,37h3q8,AnusTasteBuds,27,Wed May 27 17:40:55 2015 UTC,"Warm-blooded is a bit of a misnomer: although they do maintain their temperature above that of the water, it's not consistent like mammals manage. It fluctuates with the water temp - always a few degrees higher than ambient, unlike, say, a whale, which always has the same body temp regardless of how cold the water.  Still pretty cool how they do it, tho! :)"
Awwducational,37h3q8,oneandoneis2,10,Wed May 27 19:53:00 2015 UTC,"Though they can't consistently they are still considered endothermic. Warm-blooded is also an archaic term we don't use anymore, but most people are familiar with the concept when it's described that way."

Awwducational,37h3q8,hypnofed,6,Wed May 27 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"Indeed! The special blood vessel arrangement is called retia.

Mako sharks, who travel vertically and come across very different temperatures in a short time, especially need this feature to keep the eyes and brain stabilized."

Awwducational,37bw53,newheart_restart,2,Wed May 27 03:55:54 2015 UTC,"Purely as guide animals they're better than dogs imo.  However, the level of care required is much higher, so most people are better off with dogs.  Mini horses need lots of space, a fair amount of sometimes expensive food, and a companion (ideally another horse of any size) to keep them company. They also cannot be expected to work long hours like dogs can. They're mostly for outings, whereas a guide dog can be on the clock almost 24/7 and be perfectly happy. They're very good for people in rural areas who don't need help around their own house, only in public situations."
Awwducational,37bw53,dandelion_k,1 point,Wed May 27 07:51:34 2015 UTC,"There is literally no evidence that a seeing eye horse handles hazards better. In fact, I've personally seen evidence to the contrary. A neighboring farm in 2006 was boarding a seeing eye horse, who repeateadly lead its owner through mud and tripped her over a log.   Not to mention, they're flight animals by nature. You dont want to be the blind person holding the lead of a horse when it decides to run.   I don't feel like retyping my entire comment below, but theres plenty of cons about horses serving as guide animals."

That is not a deformed horse any more than a jack Russell terrier is a deformed dog. Horses can come in many sizes, and we have bred some breeds to be shorter than others."
Awwducational,37bw53,dandelion_k,3,Wed May 27 07:53:52 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the obvious - being larger, needing more food, more expensive vet bills, and an inability to climb multiple stairs or difficult stairs (IE, a spiral staircase or even a curved staircase is not going to happen), there is a lot that keeps them from being good seeing eye animals.   Here is an actual vision-impaired person writing about not only the Guide Horse Foundation and their lack of knowledge for needs, but problems regarding horses.   There have been no studies done on their use, so I don't know what ""sources"" you want me to use, and I'm betting, of course, just basic information on horses won't work, but in the hopes of maybe educating someone today, I'll try anyway.  To start, horses are flight animals.  Except in cases of choosing a pecking order in the herd or protecting their young, horses don't often take a fighting stance.  Even the best trained police horses (who usually go through far longer training than a seeing eye mini) can panick in certain conditions. Can you imagine a seeing eye animal panicking with a disabled person holding on to them? We heard of a case where a seeing eye mini panicking in a retail store and crashing through a plate glass window.  Additionally, while horses do have good eyesight in general, their primary blind spot is right in front of their faces, and it extends for 3 or 4 feet. Not exactly ideal for a guiding animal. They also have some difficulty qualifying depth.   If you spend time around horses, you'll notice them being incredibly weird around dark shadows and the smallest of steps; sometimes they can't tell if its a shadow or a hole. This is why in some horse obstacle courses, they can lay a blue tarp down to be ""water"". They must tilt their heads down completely to use ""binocular"" type vision to clarify what they are seeing.   Last but not least in the vision category, they are dichromatic viewers, which means they are more or less colorblind.   Finally, and most importantly, is the idea of cognitive dissonance. A seeing eye dog will not walk you into traffic, even if you give it the command to go. A horse will not always do this. It may start to move towards traffic, then it's flight instincts kick in - not because the owner is in danger, but because IT is in danger.  I am by no means saying a horse isn't smart, because it is. But you can watch any jumping show and see horses that have trained for years buck what their owners are telling it to do. And that brings us back to the first point.   There have been seeing eye horses that don't panic and don't cause problems. But for every one of those, I've heard nightmares about horses crapping inside houses (and restaurants, and retailers), leading their owners astray, and causing their owners harm.  As a general therapy animal, I believe horses are perfect for that. They are, in general, kind and loving animals. But if my mother or my child was blind, I would never, ever set them up with a horse.   As for the lawsuit, it was largely a defamation lawsuit (I believe...I can only find limited documents about it online, and this was nearly 10 years ago) that began after my mother refused to sell the woman several horses for training, because she discussed the issue online on a breeding forum. That being said, they had discussed the issue several times previously; the lawsuit was only brought when my mother refused to sell her horses. The lawsuit was thrown out and they had to pay our court fees.  And I know quite well ""horses come in many sizes"". I was raised on a miniature horse and shetland pony farm. The current pictured example isn't nearly as badly conformed as most dwarves, but that makes it an exception, not a rule."

Awwducational,36r1gm,DobroJutroLo,32,Thu May 21 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for linking to this article. I've always thought docking was really cruel and used only for aesthetic purposes. Looks like it's much more for practicality and disease prevention, at least where farm animals/horses are concerned. Seems likes it is much more commonly aesthetic in dogs though, which is uncool :("
Awwducational,36r1gm,princess_kushlestia,45,Fri May 22 06:48:59 2015 UTC,"Our local vets agreed a couple years ago that they would no longer dock dogs' tails for cosmetic purposes (working dogs would obviously be an exception).  They were seeing a lot of complications due to docking, often in older dogs whose surgery had initially seemed to heal perfectly.  Unfortunately, it was too late for the dog we adopted.  She is now almost 9, and suffers from some sort of nerve damage in her tail, that leads her to lick and chew it obsessively.  She'll be on meds for the rest of her life (including steroids), and even with that, she can't be left unsupervised for any length of time (not even a minute).  For nights, I actually crocheted up a suit for her to sleep in, that keeps her off her tail.  A local breeder (spaniels) told me they did an experiment with a new litter of puppies, many years ago.  They docked half of them, and left the other half intact.  Four weeks later, the undocked puppies had better movement.  So they don't dock any more, either.  Basically, yes, it can be cruel and used only for aesthetic purposes.  :-("

Awwducational,36r1gm,nybornwad,21,Thu May 21 16:28:10 2015 UTC,"I think the difference with lambs is that you aren't expecting them to live with you for a couple decades, and you can't afford to tend to each of them individually (cleaning, grooming, etc), the way you would a pet.  So docking makes good, practical sense, from that point of view."
Awwducational,36r1gm,rebelkitty,25,Thu May 21 17:14:24 2015 UTC,"Well, their urine and feces gets soaked up in their tails, flies come and spread diseases and goes up their intestines, and it isn't noticeable until they get really sick.

Awwducational,36r1gm,poniez4lyfe,14,Thu May 21 17:57:26 2015 UTC,I worked as a vet tech and when the vet would dock puppies' tails it was terrible. The puppies are too young for any pain medication so they just do it awake and raw with a pair of surgical scissors. Never heard puppies scream/squeal like that. I wish I never witnessed it.   Dogs with docked tails always were aggressive with their rear area as adults in the clinic. Like if they ever needed their anal glands expressed those would be the ones that need the muzzles.

So I think it's a bit of a crap shoot, whether you get away without consequences or not.  I'm glad your dogs are fine!  Similarly:  I also had a declawed cat, many, many years ago, who suffered no complications whatsoever from the surgery.  Didn't seem to bother her in the slightest.

I don't think all dogs are like that as adults who have docked tails. I wish our pointer had her tail docked as well. She has broken the tip of her tail so many times because she gets so happy and wags her tail against the walls and furniture so hard that it breaks or at least has been broken several times.

Examples would be icelandic sheep. They don't need to be docked. There's also fat tail sheep who don't need to be docked. Hair sheep - who grow hair instead of wool - can remain intact as well.  I'll admit I didn't read the link, so I'm not sure if Wikipedia covers this.. But if they did, hey, I have pictures."

This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors.   Poor Dodo"

Awwducational,36isxj,remotectrl,17,Tue May 19 18:55:12 2015 UTC,yes indeed one problem was that sailors brought rata and pigs and so on on those islands and they ate the dodo eggs.

Awwducational,366c3g,Myrandall,5,Sun May 17 05:11:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't intend to be rude to /u/malz_ and I apologize if that was how it was taken. A mod of another sub I follow made a rather insightful post the other day when someone was complaining about the content. I'll quote the relevant bits here:   This sub (and any other) will be shaped by the people who generate content by submitting links and comments.  If you want to only see content of a certain type, but never submit it, then you're at the whim of what others post.  Many people who do regularly post tend to submit threads on a similar topic. Either they have an interest in it or they've figured out what gets votes and are motivated by earning karma.  Asking people to post or act a certain way does very little.  Reddit in general has a lot of bystander effect regarding desired content VS the feedback loop that tends to cause a narrowing of the focus in any given sub.  Submit more original content and/or articles about local things you like if you want to see a different attitude/focus in the community.   Submitting content to this sub is very easy. I often begin by watching a David Attenborough program or seeing an interesting picture, then I look up the wikipedia page for the creature I've chosen, and then use whatever fact jumps out at me.  There is actually a huge bias towards cute animals in the sciences. Even things like birds are unreported compared to the cuter mammals and its even worse for things like mollusks. There is close to 8 million animal species, most we know very little about (~10,000 new species are discovered annually, most are invertebrates), but cats are the most frequent topic on this subreddit. There's plenty of room for diversity in here, even if they aren't all as cute as goats. :)"

Friend is accustomed to her eccentric husband, but that day she was less amused than usual. ""How old is it,"" she asked.  ""Only 3 or 4,"" he said excitedly.  ""He'll get muuuuch bigger!"" ""And how long do they live?"" ""Um, 100 years?  Maybe more."" Husband paused, perhaps realizing the flaw in his pet plan. This was the day my friend realized she would likely have to make a provision in her will for what happened to a 140 lb. tortoise after she and her husband, and possibly even her son, died.  They had a large piece of property, with a big, fenced-in yard in L.A., and built a pen for him within the yard for when they weren't home. He also had a turtle door into a garage for inclement weather, and seemed to be thriving.  When I met him I thought he resembled a VW bug more than anything.  Sadly, someone came onto their property and stole him.  Friend made sure - no more tortoises after that. I love my friend's husband - he's a great guy, but holy hell, that seems like an incredibly bad choice for a pet.  I was actually surprised it was legal in statute-happy California, but that was better than thinking this nice guy bought an animal off the black market."

Awwducational,35ptc0,LeiningensAnts,3,Tue May 12 19:03:22 2015 UTC,"Most alpaca shows are 60/40 shows.  Meaning that the judge considers the fiber(not fleece)as 60% of what they base the placings on.  The other 40% is based on conformation of the alpaca.    Alpaca fiber is actually not truly hypoallergenic.  The reason people think it is is because it does not contain lanolin, the oils in a sheeps wool, which causes wool allergy.  Alpaca fiber also has smaller primary or guard hairs which can cause a scratchy or itchy feeling on the skin.  Fun note, Alpaca fiber is actually warmer and lighter weight that sheep wool.  This is due to it being a hollow core fiber, which is filled with air that makes it insulated.    Source: am a Alpaca Farmer"

Awwducational,35lcnk,You_meddling_kids,35,Mon May 11 17:06:26 2015 UTC,We always bring a laser pointer to any zoo/pet store we go to.  It's amazing what animals you can entertain with it - I think my favourite is penguins as they waddle around in a gang after it.  (Of course never shine it near an animals eyes!)  Watching a tiger chase a laser pointer is also awesome.
Awwducational,35lcnk,Fishtails,69,Mon May 11 15:05:08 2015 UTC,"PLEASE DO NOT BRING LASER POINTERS TO THE ZOO!!!  We always want people to have fun when they visit the zoo, but it's important to understand that the animals are not yours to harass just because you think it's funny or that the animals seem ""bored"".  Many animals (big cats especially) sleep most of the day as part of their natural behavior, it's not boredom.  Yeah, it's better than people who throw items at the animals because they want to see them move, but it's still not something we want our guests to be doing.  Also, there are a lot of things that go on behind the scenes that you might be messing with.  You might be distracting an animal while keepers are trying to get it to shift off exhibit, or getting it all worked up just before a training session or a vet visit, or if the animals are in a group you could cause an increase in aggression as all the animals start stressing out due to a frantic chase of something they are unable to catch.  Sorry if this comes off as an over-reaction, but it's very frustrating to have guests treat our animals as their personal playthings.  And I know you're probably very responsible when you bring the pointer, but my zoo has around 2 million visitors a year, which means we are going to get many guests who are much less responsible and we don't have the time to weed out just those individuals.  tl;dr: Come have fun at the zoo but leave the lasers at home.  -aZookeeper"
Awwducational,35lcnk,Bommer-Sooner,2,Tue May 12 00:42:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply :)  As I said staff at the zoo have never really objected and we are careful - but I definitely see your points and I will leave the pointer at home with our own pets next time!

Some of the footage and a more thorough description of this behavior can be found in this article. I used the word 'typically', but this source,which has more video of chick(s), says clutch size can range from one to three, which contradicts what the BBC said. In any case, be glad that your mother is not a shoebill.  The timetable for the second chicks death may vary, but Nat Geo gave it a week and in this instance researchers got a picture of a chick and a second egg, but never saw the second chick so I suspect window is pretty short between the first chick hatching and the fratricide.  Also fratricide sounds way better than siblicide, which has been documented in a number of species, so I went with that because Merriam-Webster doesn't make a distinction based on sex."

The authors of the paper referenced by your source  only suggest that the global magnetic field is being used during the hunting behavior of foxes since other cues like wind, light, etc did not show significant correlation.

But just how a voltmeter is way better at measuring electrical activity than magnetic, so are those organs. I can totally induce current with a magnet, push it through a resistor, and then measure the voltage, and then calculate the strength of the magnet; but that is not what that tool is for. Same with these organs.   Yes, eye sensitivity to magnetic fields is their hypothesis. They don't list any motivation for it though. There has been no animal reported to sense the earth's magnetic field with it's eyes. I don't know of any reports of eyes doing anything but seeing light within a very constricted band of EM waves. I think the lowest reported frequency of any animal being able to see is around 600THz (ultravioet), and the earth's magnetic field can oscilate particles at 2.5kHz. Ain't nobody gonna see that. The animals that can sense electric fields at these frequencies have specialized organs to do so.   I mean, it would be super freaking cool if foxes could see magnetic fields. But the idea is way far fetched. I mean, all you'd have to do to disprove it is to bring a strong magnet to the field and see if it screws up with the fox's sense of direction."

But AFAIK the organ is specialized to detect EMGs coming from fish that are hiding so you'd need a pretty precise magnetic flux. I think there are shark repellents that work like that.  Also, the earth's magnetic field is so weak. Get a coil, attach it to an oscilloscope, wave it around and see how much current is generated. I'm gonna bet it would be too small to be detected.

Awwducational,35b81z,giszmo,3,Fri May 8 17:36:01 2015 UTC,"Same is true for the human aka the claim is arbitrary. Isolation always results in a gradient, where the mammal might have 37°C at some point under the skin and the surrounding air might have -50°C. Under these circumstances 3 hairs are enough to carry a snow flake that will not melt, while a sufficiently thick cover of snow might isolate well enough that the bottom layer actually does melt even for the bison but certainly if the surrounding temperature is 0°C."

Awwducational,34undy,XChronic,6,Tue May 5 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting idea, I did the calcs to see if it works out. Considering a solid strand of spider silk holding back a jet plane from going forward.   Spider's silk Tensile Strength: 850Mpa [1]  Dry Thrust of a F-15 Eagle: 130kN [2]  Area Required = 130kN/850Mpa = 1.529 e-4 m2  r = sqrt(A/Pi)=6.98e-3 m = 6.98mm  Diameter needed = 13.95mm   And quickly measuring a 2B pencil I had lying around.   Damnit, almost worked, just off by a factor of 2! Way closer than I expected actually.   If we used a lesser jet, or a strand the thickness of a thick sharpie, we are all good. Ofcourse the material properties are unlikely to scale.   Also, it depends on interpretation of the statement. If its about an entire web infront of the plane, that would be easier, but I'd argue you wouldn't even need the entire tensile strength, you would probably just slice up/ break the plane as it tried to go through."

But, it doesn't need to be perfect. The most amazing things about our brains (and animal brains) is that they have pattern recognition. You don't need to create a perfect environment to do this experiment because their brains will fill in the gaps. If they have self-recognition they will have a parallel understanding of the image and their own self. Judging from these tests, they suggest that the Eurasian Magpie does in fact have this ability.

One of the reasons is that it is believed that the Magpie is self-aware, that means it can recognise itself in the mirror. This is tested by sticking some dot/mark on the Magpie and placing it in front of a mirror. Upon seeing that mark the Magpie tries to remove it from itself. The same behaviour can be, for example, also seen in some of the more intelligent apes.  Here is a journal publication from 2008."

Unfortunately my brief search didn't turn up any studies into the matter with them. Hopefully someone will see these studies and want to replicate them with the Aussie bird.  As a side note, the first time I ever even found out that the Australian magpie is unrelated to the Eurasian one — and to corvids in general — was back when all the ""crow/jackdaw"" stuff was taking place.

This species was introduced to the West Indies, the Hawaiian Islands ....         This species is listed as Least Concern (LC) in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category. The species is found in a wide variety of open habitats including low intensity use agriculture, and thus habitat modification is very unlikely to significantly effect the species to warrant a list category higher than LC (especially given the species presumed short generation time). Records of the species especially from agricultural areas in Lao where hunting of wildlife has been very intense, strongly suggest a high degree of resilience to persecution. In very large areas of Cambodia, a significant portion of the species' mainland SE Asian population, both pressure from habitat modification and hunting are very low. No other threats have been identified that could be leading to a significant decline in the species.

Awwducational,349wgv,remotectrl,85,Wed Apr 29 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"This is called myrmecophily and it's fairly common. Lots of butterflies and true bugs are able to coerce ants into protecting them by providing honeydew, a sweet substance which ants love. This butterfly takes it a step further by producing an analog of ant pheromones, the chemicals ants use to communicate, that it deploys when it feels threatened. This pheromone puts the ants on high alert and they start going nuts attacking whatever they think might be hostile to them or the caterpillar (which they think is like their baby)."
Awwducational,349wgv,DumDumDog,13,Wed Apr 29 15:18:45 2015 UTC,It could go deeper than that.   Sure the caterpillar send out the right smells. However the ants may benefit from taking care of the butterfly in the long run and that might be the driving force behind them taking care of the caterpillar. I am not saying you are wrong i am saying there can be other influences at work here now. It could very well help the ant and the ant knows it ( not really knows it but is something that they now do because it had benefited them in the past and now it is part of the algorithm )

The bat in the picture here is a young grey-headed flying fox pup.  We aren't sure why they do it, if they do it for any reason at all. It's also not similar to oral sex in humans, because the tip of the penis is inside the female while she licks the base. A human would have to be very bendy to do that. There's a video clip on the wikipedia page (the source /u/name_with_a_y linked to) if you're curious how they do it.

Copulation by males is dorsoventral and the females lick the shaft or the base of the male's penis, but not the glans which has already penetrated the vagina. While the females do this, the penis is not withdrawn and research has shown a positive relationship between length of the time that the penis is licked and the duration of copulation."

This was before there were very many hypoallergenic dog breeds, and no breeders of them at all where I lived.  Pygmy goats are smart, and though they are stubborn, they can be trained to walk on a leash and even be housebroken.  We raised 4-6 kids a year, made sure they were well-socialized, and sold most of them to families who either couldn't have a dog or just realized pygmies make pretty darn good pets.

But LGDs are different than just a good ol' retriever, they need to be raised with the goats/sheep/whatever, and they often prefer them over you. At least, they don't want to live you, they want to live with their herd.  As for a dog being a substitute for a goat friend, the dog would have to be ok with living with the goat outdoors, and even then I'm not sure how they'd work for a substitute for one of their own species. They get along wonderfully when as a herd + dog, but like I said, a dog with a lone goat probably wouldn't be the best substitute as a pair of goats."

Did my undergrad thesis on this stuff and ship engine noise and cavitation fall at around the same frequency band so it's possible that whales that broadcast at a higher frequency are drowned out by the ships which means they can no longer mate which leaves 'deeper voiced' whales with all the lady whales.

Then the development of the steamship in the nineteenth century introduced an ominous source of noise pollution. As commercial and military vessels became more abundant, the noise background in the oceans, especially at a frequency of twenty Hertz, became noticeable. Whales communicating across the oceans must have experienced increasingly greater difficulties. The distance over which they could communicate must have decreased steadily. Two hundred years ago, a typical distance across which finbacks could communicate was perhaps 10,000 kilometers. Today, the corresponding number is perhaps a few hundred kilometers.

Awwducational,3352qm,spin81,4,Sun Apr 19 19:38:58 2015 UTC,"""Onze Lieve Heer"" is a Dutch phrase sometimes specifically used by Christians to refer to God. So ""dear lord"" is actually closer to the real meaning. The adjective ""lief"" is not used that way anymore today apart from that sentence, so it's a bit hard to translate properly.  It's actually one word, lieveheersbeestje but /u/smessies makes easier to put into Google translate. If I had to translate it literally I'd call it ""little animal of (the) dear Lord"". But smessies' version works a lot better. :)  Edit: it's just occurred to me that you may have pasted it into Google Translate, but the Dutch word ""lief"" can mean a few different things. It can mean sweet, like nice, as in ""that's sweet of you"", or ""he's such a sweet guy"". If you say ""ik heb je lief"" it means ""I love you"", and if you say ""[bla] is mij lief"" it means ""I hold [bla] dear"" but both of those are considered old-fashioned, almost archaic in the Netherlands, especially that last one; this may not be the case in Belgium btw. Anyway, the meaning of ""lieve"" in the word for ladybug is a bit like the latter two meanings."

It doesn't spell the end of a gene pool by itself. It's not like a gene pool is tainted by inbreeding and so automatically every product of it is going to be a hideous monster or that the gene pool cannot bounce back later in a few generations. In fact the opposite is true.  That whole idea about inbreeding is just a bad biology myth that gets repeated mindlessly. You can read all about inbreeding on Wikipedia.

By staying apart, it ensures the survival of the troop since they can't all be wiped out at once.  Source: Anthropologist (Not me, but an anthropologist told me this. In college.)"
Awwducational,31ve4w,BobKipper,22,Wed Apr 8 16:41:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that's not actually true.  Orangutans are solitary because of limited access to ripe fruit, they have to forage all over the place for it, the more people in a group, the less there could be for some individuals in the group. There are some exceptions to this: 1) Females may stick together in a small group if there is not a drastic decrease in food. 2) Occasionally during the spring/summer an abundance of fruit will ripen and Orangutans will form large groups while they snack like crazy, but it is almost all females.  They are also somewhat solitary because they have no natural predators, limiting the need for group protection. Orangutans are arboreal (meaning they stay in the trees most of the time), and the largest predator to be a danger to them is the Sumatran Tiger which is terrestrial (stays on the ground).  Typical social structure is generally a lot of females in an area (some grouped together, some not), with a ""dominant male"" (noticeable by the large facial pads) commanding a large territory. Non-dominant males (who typically will not develop the large facial pads) roam around on their own trying to eek out a living and avoid the dominant male. In terms of reproduction, this has lead to less dominant males commonly raping females they encounter, then playing no part in the rearing of any potential offspring.  I find Orangutans tremendously interesting so if you have any questions feel free to ask.  Source: Graduated with a degree in Anthropology, taking a lot of Primatology courses with an emphasis on Orangutan social and communication studies.  Also some good sources out there such as: orangutan.org"

Awwducational,31ve4w,luluskywalker,5,Wed Apr 8 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"Orungatans are often joked about as being ""the anthropologists of the animal kingdom"". This is because when a human is walking by the Orangutan will just sit up in the tree and observe them. If they were concerned about humans killing them they would probably run away rather than sit and observe. There could have been new findings in the field since I graduated, but the website I cited above lists the reason for being solitary the same as what I was taught (and described above). Cheers!"

Males compete, perhaps less directly than in many other examples, with each other to find the females. Taken to the extreme, this mating strategy can give rise to female morphs like bagworms where the female never resembles the winged male."

Awwducational,31c5wl,Notch__Johnson,26,Fri Apr 3 21:16:27 2015 UTC,"While technically true, this is not the reason for their arms being longer than their legs. In primates whose arms are longer than their legs, this means their primary mode of locomotion is brachiation (swinging from limb to limb). Many extant adult gorillas are too large to actually do so gracefully in a tree, but they will still use there arms to grasp branches to aid in locomotion if they are within reach from the ground.  However, compared to other brachiators like gibbons whose arms are MUCH longer than their legs, their arms are not fantastically longer than their legs which allows them to still walk on all fours when necessary.  To follow the logic further, primates who have arms and legs that are roughly the same length will primarily walk on all fours.  Primates whose legs are longer than their arms will be bipedal like humans."
Awwducational,31c5wl,Fitzch,15,Fri Apr 3 18:55:06 2015 UTC,"Well I didn't say it was the reason they had longer arms, just that it allows and aids them in walking on all fours while keeping their bodies in an upright position.  Very interesting explanation though about brachiation."

Although they are physically able to brachiate (as are humans, hence the monkey bars as the playground), they do not spend much time in trees at all. These large primates only go up in trees at night for sleeping (edit to add that orangutans do spend more time up in trees).  Great apes are obviously more upright than other apes and other primates, but they still are not considered truly bipedal. I believe the first truly primate was Australopithecus afarensis (""Lucy""), who stood at barely 3 feet tall."

No idea if they can get any bigger than that, but that's already surprisingly large for something most people think of as tiny and skittish like a fox. They aren't aggressive towards humans at all as far as I can tell, and I believe they are usually solitary hunters. So over all, they're like any other wild animal in that they will only threaten humans in very limited circumstances. Case in point, there was a story I remember hearing of a few years ago where some girl was killed by two coyotes, although I have no idea what the details in that case were."
Awwducational,31bso0,bagofantelopes,15,Fri Apr 3 21:46:18 2015 UTC,"I recently moved from the eastern US from an area that had a lot of coyotes to the western US in an area that has a lot of coyotes. The differences are incredible. The Eastern coyotes are just so much taller, even more than the weight difference this really stands out. My dog used to roam the woods around our house and play with Eastern coyotes regularly. They would meet on a hill, play-bow, then romp around a little while before going their separate ways. He tried to do that here to the smaller Western coyotes and got his ass handed to him twice. A pack of them (I counted about 10) surrounded us on a walk in the mountains and I had to really work hard not to panic. Despite their small size they are definitely more aggressive."
Awwducational,31bso0,joeray,9,Fri Apr 3 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"I imagine they're a little bit fiercer due to scarcer food, or just territoriality.

They've never bothered me at our home (we live on a golf course so they frequent the area). They usually keep to themselves unless you have small pets around. Anyway, that's crazy that they surrounded you and your dog! I'm glad you guys made it out without any trouble.  EDIT: Added last two sentences."

Awwducational,31bso0,MyNameIsDon,2,Sat Apr 4 07:32:14 2015 UTC,"Which is another thing that always cracks me up: most people see a husky or a german shepard and think it's a wolf. Like, seriously guys?  The very smallest wolf is 80 lbs, most are closer to 100 lbs.  Huskies aren't supposed to be more than 60 lbs and shepards peak out at 70 lbs.  Wolves are a good 20 to thirty pounds heavier than the dog breeds. They are MUCH bigger. Even if you are stupid and easily confused about skull shape and markings....  I think coy wolves are a part of their confusion. The cross breeds are pretty common and people get to thinking they are wolves and it gives them a distorted view of just how big a wolf really is."
Awwducational,31bso0,Jmrwacko,4,Sat Apr 4 03:03:10 2015 UTC,"Male German shepherds can weigh up to 88lbs (or 40kg) and still fall within the AKC breed standard. Male Alaskan malamutes weigh around 85lbs.  Gray wolves average around 80lbs for females and 100lbs for males. Wolves in the north can weigh 20-50lbs more, but Mexican wolves (the subspecies that lives in Arizona, New Mexico, and in Mexico) weigh only around 60-70lbs.

Comparing their hippocampus to other species we consider to be highly emotional; the hippocampus of an elephant takes up about 0.7% of the central structures of the brain, comparable to 0.5% for humans and with 0.1% in Risso's dolphins and 0.05% in bottlenose dolphins.

Awwducational,31cxoz,joeray,1 point,Sat Apr 4 10:28:02 2015 UTC,"The hippocampus is involved more with factual and discrete memory retrieval though, not traumatic material.  The amygdala is where most traumatic memories are 'stored'.   Just having a larger hippocampus in and of itself doesn't seem like it would predispose Elephants to traumatic memories, but maybe just a more sophisticated system of memory.  The Hippocampus might explain the quantity of elephant memory, but not the emotional quality of those memories - that would be more a factor of how it was linked with the amygdala."

I have always like my pets as fluffy and long haired as possible. I am a huge animal lover and whenever I see this type of animal I have a harder time warming up to it and I would actually really like to.
Awwducational,315eoo,PocketNicks,45,Thu Apr 2 10:45:22 2015 UTC,You get to know how it felt like to have a goblin pet
Awwducational,315eoo,PocketNicks,26,Thu Apr 2 10:59:27 2015 UTC,"I used to feel this way about hairless cats until I finally met one and got to interact with it. They aren't actually hairless, they have a very fine coat and their skin feels velvety and smooth (not fleshy).

Awwducational,315eoo,Ishmael1217,6,Thu Apr 2 12:19:20 2015 UTC,"You're referring to Canadian Sphynx. Their hairlessness is a recessive gene and they typically aren't 100% hairless.

Awwducational,315eoo,MuffinBottomPie,6,Tue Apr 7 05:12:13 2015 UTC,"As an owner of two sphynx cats, I would like to explain their appeal.

After a little over a year with my kitties, I absolutely adore them. They are cuddly and playful. They love human interaction and even sleep in bed with us ever night. As an added benefit, there isn't cat hair all over my apartment. They are more high maintenance than other cats, requiring weekly baths, nail clipping and cleanings, and ear cleanings. It's totally worth it though. I might be a little biased, but I think it's the best cat breed."

Awwducational,315eoo,Boofers,6,Thu Apr 2 11:57:28 2015 UTC,"Serious answer:  Chihuahuas are loved by many who want 'tiny things'. They ignore the arguably bad sides to them and love the idea of holding a teeny tiny animal in one hand and even dressing up their widdle babies. It's a good dog if you want to spoil it and adore it and give it your undivided attention.  Hairless cats are fantastic for those with a fur allergy. On top of that, the lack of grooming is preferred by some, making it ideal for people who just don't want a hairy cat. - Supposedly quite the opposite, thanks to /u/PocketNicks"

Awwducational,3117zr,Thandruin,39,Wed Apr 1 21:55:08 2015 UTC,"There is some controversy surrounding this fantastic animal. Encyclopedia Britannica points out that a Phoenix lifespan is usually no less than 500 years, barring injury. Wikipedia points out an upper limit of 1400 years based on observations in 1876. The general consensus is that the act of self-immoluation causes no pain to the Phoenix, and is essential to its life cycle. They prefer to end their cycle on a nest of Cinnamon, Sassafras, Ailanthus, Cedar, and/or Mastic twigs, but can renew their lifespan in the absence of these materials. Without these twigs, though, their next life will be shortened. Upon rebirth, they undergo a brief period of disorientation, but do regain their memories of their past lives within a month."

He saw what Ginny did to the roosters and felt that it was a basilisk in tow. So, he grew anxious and afraid, which pushed him to an early burning due to anxiety-induced sickness."

Any little move I made was going to affect the entire flock. If I spooked them they, every single one of thousands even if they had no direct sightline on me, would have moved in the same direction away from me. It gave me shivers.

Awwducational,30m486,mrmidgetfury,65,Sat Mar 28 17:51:27 2015 UTC,"Racoons are fast breeders, they are highly destructive to structures and they can live virtually anywhere. They are also dangerous intelligent and capable fighters. I've seen raccoons who were shot in the head multiple times drop out of the tree and fight a dog.  When I lived in the city it was not uncommon to see them coming down into the streets at dusk to feed on people's trash. For the last twenty plus years I've lived in the country and they can be a real problem. They nest in the soffets of the barn damaging the structure, they kill chickens sometimes just for sport and they take on dogs and cats if they come too close. They are so used to humans most show little fear. They are frequently hit in the road.   When raccoon pelts sold well, before people decided petroleum based fake fur was great (bullshit these petroleum based faux fur and leather products take an obscene amount of time to degrade in landfills and because they are frequently cheaply constructed there are lots of them in landfills) it was pretty common for people to kill raccoons and sell the pelts. The rural population was kept in check. Now fur has fell out of favor and few hunt them anymore.   Raccoons are out of control everywhere. I find myself on a pretty regular basis putting down obviously ill and injured animals. Keeping them out of the barn is an on-going battle.   I wish raccoon fur was still in favor."
Awwducational,30m486,wynper,38,Sat Mar 28 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"The rural population is much, much, much lower than urban populations. Part of that is due to the mesopredator release caused by removing their predators, but raccoons (and coyotes, skunks, and opossums) are all highly adaptable and have found that urban and suburban landscapes provide great habitat for them."

In my part of Michigan (I am located between three cities in lower MI) we have an issue with coyotes as well. They too are quite used to humans. I am on twenty-five acres and it's not uncommon to hear them although seeing them is not as common.   There are many problems associated with them just as with raccoons."

I was trying to find out how to deter the coyotes. darn internet... but it was one of the top reasons. the number one reason was their lack of food. they eat mostly voles and other small woodland creatures and there is a shortage due to a couple of harsh winters. also with the mixing of domestic dogs the coyotes now have more litters. where there would usually be just one litter a year now they are having two and three litters..also, incase anyone wants to know.. the number one thing to keep them away is cougars... and if you don't have one handy they sell a recording of the scream the cougars make... motion lights and don't feed them was second... lol"

There's a lot of money to be made from their skins, and he's an avid coon hunter and trapper of rabbits, coyote, otter, and beaver.   Last winter, he caught an albino otter and a Beaver that was white with brown spots.   Those pelts can go upwards of $500 - $1000 alone.   My grandad was also a coon hunter. Raised dogs just for it.   One night after a long day of hunting, he drove me out to a country road at the mouth of a hollow, and we just sat and waited. About ten minutes later, we heard the distinctive bellow of a couple of coon dogs on a trail. If I hadn't been raised around it, it would've been the creepiest sound I'd heard, but it was somewhat pleasant. He called it a coon tune.   Anyway, I got off on a somewhat related story.

Awwducational,30m486,jac777,7,Sat Mar 28 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"No. The design of landfills does inhibit decomposition, but landfills are, your words, specifically designed to allow decomposition despite the overall construction."

It was raining so hard and it was starting to fill up down there with rain water.  We tied knots (about a foot apart) in the rope to act as a ladder. I tied it off to the grate on the street and dropped it down. We then sat in my car for about 20 minutes watching from about 30 feet away. Just as we were about to lose hope that it would work, little guy can crawling out. He went into my neighbors yard and we never saw him again. Great success!"

Scientists have even figured out the exact time when it makes the most sense to share food (the point where the receiver has the greatest benefit and the donor has the least cost) and the bats seemed to always share around that point. I actually haven't posted about this behavior at /r/batfacts yet. I will have to fix that soon.  Interestingly, males don't share often in the wild, but will in captivity. This may have to do with their transient status in most social groups (can't share with someone you don't know well). Here's a great RadioLab episode about how reciprocal altruism works and was discovered.   You can watch a captive vampire bat colony online at socialbat.org."

Filter floss which provides mechanical filtration (removes particles) and Seachem Matrix which is a refined pumice which offers very high amounts of surface area and is where my biological filtration will take place for the most part.  Bacteria will build up there that consume ammonia and who's waste is nitrite and then more who consume the nitrite and convert it into nitrate which is much less toxic than those other forms of nitrogen and is removed through dilution in water changes.  This process is called the nitrogen cycle and when a filter has bacteria built up it is considered cycled. There is also another air driven filter not shown called a sponge filter which is essentially just a tube with a sponge and it offers purely biological filtration.  Normally you would ""cycle"" a filter prior to adding fish in either by running it in an established tank for a while or adding ammonia to the water in a fishless cycle (add pure ammonia until 4 ppm of ammonia is reached and dose as often as needed until ammonia disappears within 24 hours and then monitor for nitrites and nitrates or a fish in cycle which is riskier and can be damaging to fish where you add in the fish right away and should do daily water changes while monitoring for ammonia to make sure it doesn't reach very harmful levels while the nitrogen cycle is getting started.

The first bumblebees to be seen in spring are the queens; only the queen hibernates through the winter. The queen is much bigger than the workers, which appear later. As soon as the queen has found some nectar, to replenish her energy reserves, she starts looking for a suitable site to build her nest. The nest site is usually underground; an abandoned mouse burrow is often used. Inside, the queen first builds a nectar pot, which will sustain her during bad weather. She also begins to build up a pollen larder, which will feed her brood."

Other animals the eggs are only available when they cycle."
Awwducational,3096s1,CochinBrahmaLover,3,Wed Mar 25 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"In other animals, there are follicular waves. This means that there is development of several eggs (follicles), from which one or more become dominant and ovulate. In llama's, there are also follicular waves (every 12-14 days), and the development of one or more of these follicles into the pre-dominant stage. These follicles are ready for ovulation and will only do this when mating occurs. It's impossible to have follicles ready for ovulation all the time. If no mating takes place, a new follicular wave will occur.

I raise alpacas and we breed one day wait two and breed again. Two weeks later we do a ""spit test"". If the female is pregnant she will spit at the male and try to get away. We usually do 3 spit test a few weeks apart. Gestation runs a little over 11months resulting in a single birth. A lot of time and effort to achieve a live birth."

Awwducational,305s7s,rhandyrhoads,2,Tue Mar 24 18:37:39 2015 UTC,The process of holding is stressful because they often can't eat while they have eggs in their mouths so they will go a month without eating.  Young mothers like this one will also often spit the eggs out prematurely.
Awwducational,305s7s,Cbracher,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:38:25 2015 UTC,How do you get the eggs from the fish? Do they float in the water for a while before the mother gathers them up in her mouth? Does the stress of losing all of her eggs not contribute to her stress?  Sorry for all of the questions btw. Thanks for posting!
Awwducational,305s7s,Cbracher,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:53:09 2015 UTC,"Well when they breed the male does a seizure-like dance for the female and then chases her a bit.  If she decides to breed with him they go to a cave or flat rock and circle each other and she will deposit eggs and take them into her mouth and he will fertilize the eggs in her mouth.  When the eggs are in her mouth she couldn't eat.  Some females can but most can't I believe.  She also got very territorial and protective.  I took her out after two days since I was leaving for vacation and cut a piece of airline tubing at an angle so there was a wedgelike shape at the end and netted her out into a bowl where I popped open her mouth with the tubing and shook her a bit until the eggs came out in a process called stripping.  Then I poured the eggs into the tumbler.  This is a very stressful process for her, but not as stressful as going a month in hyper protective mode without food while the fry develop. I was planning on stripping her once the fry were developed if I didn't have a tumbler, but chances are as a young mother she would have spit earlier.  The benefits of stripping are she can breed sooner and the fry won't get eaten at all.  Sure she might protect some, but many fish in my tank are natural predators and would pick off most of the fry. As is she had a large yield for a fish her size of 28ish eggs and 27 hatched."

Awwducational,2zu1g3,fuzzybloomers,2,Sun Mar 22 13:57:28 2015 UTC,We had a nest in our compost bin (we're not great at composting...) and didn't know about it :( Found out while turning the bin one day.
Awwducational,2zu1g3,VAPossum,89,Sun Mar 22 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"(Sorry if anyone is seeing this twice.  It was supposedly removed because I used a swear word, but I still see it, so I have no idea.)  And fawns.  (BEGIN PSA TO THE FOLKS WHO DON'T KNOW, BUT LUNAR PROBABLY DOES BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS REPEATEDLY EVERY SPRING OR I FEEL LIKE I'M FAILING NATURE)  If you see a fawn lying in a strange place around your home, it's supposed to be there. In the mornings, Mom Deer will leave their young in what they feel is a safe place, so they can go and forage. That safe place is very frequently your yard, your open garage, or even your porch. Don't worry--Mom Deer will be back by sundown to get them.  Since fawns have no scent of their own, they're very safe from predators (though not from an overly curious family dog--or from humans). So just leave them be. Don't approach, don't give them food or water, and keep kids and dogs (and adults) well away from them. You don't want to scare the fawn off so Mom can't find him later.  If it's especially hot out and the fawn is without shade, you can always lay a blanket atop a couple of chairs nearby, in the fawn's line of vision (still keeping well away). That gives them the option to move if they want--but they're hearty, and Mom and Baby Deer know what they're doing.  The only exception is if the fawn is obviously injured, or if you go to bed with them in one spot, and they're still there the next morning (which could indicate something happened to Mom Deer). In those cases, call your local rehabber, or a wildlife extension agent, or if neither of those works, a vet. If you really don't know what to do, animal control or even a hunters' organization might be able to help.  And never, ever approach the fawn while Mom Deer is around. She will happily kick the heck out of what she perceives to be a threat.  If you find a baby bunny, look for the nest, and put it back in.  If you find a baby squirrel, look for the nest, and put it back in.  If you find a baby fox, skunk, coyote or raccoon, do not handle; they're vector animals. That means they're most likely to carry rabies, and handling them can mean they have to be put down for testing. Call a professional.  Basically, if you find any baby wildlife that belongs in a den, look for the nest or den, and put it back. If you can't find the nest, den, or parent, call a professional.  Oh behalf of my fellow wildlife rescue volunteers (past, present, and future), we thank you.  (END PSA)  tl;dr Wildlife is great from afar, but leave the fawns to mama deer, and call the pros for the rest."

Awwducational,2zu1g3,VAPossum,10,Sun Mar 22 14:05:29 2015 UTC,"More people need to know this! A few years back I was walking through some woods near by home and practically stepped on a fawn. It was nestled down in some ivy and I just didn't see it. Mom was there and mom was pissed. I got chased all the way back to my house!  On another occasion I was siting by the bank of a creek and a doe with an older fawn appear downstream. This was never an issue before as the deer would just give me a wide berth. This time the fawn kept creeping closer and closer. Mom stayed back stomping her hooves and snorting becoming more distressed the closer her baby got to me. I was afraid if I moved mom would charge so I sit there trying to make myself as small as possible not directly looking at any of them. The fawn is right next to me sniffing my feet when......my phone rings. Cue baby deer panic, cue mom deer protection mode, cue me running for my life in the woods again. =/ This time I didn't get chased home thankfully!  One thing to add for when a fawn really does need saving is that in some states wildlife rehab centers can't legally do anything for deer beyond humane euthanasia. In OH this was the case for the wildlife hospital I volunteered at. Adults simply can't be handled in captivity and we were legally not allowed to help fawns since deer are considered pests here. =(    It's still worth calling as they tell you anything you could do to help (pretty much just leaving it alone or putting water out) or in extreme injury cases they may come out to euthanize it."
Awwducational,2zu1g3,LicianDragon,6,Sun Mar 22 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"Luckily, in Virginia, rehabbers can take them in with the right facilities.  We handled tons of fawns in the summer.  They could easily eat up more than half our budget for the month (rather literally).  As scary as it was, that second incident must've been totally awesome, too.  A little fawn checking you out.  The phone rang at just the right time, too."
Awwducational,2zu1g3,VAPossum,3,Sun Mar 22 16:31:50 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! It was always sad getting a call in for an injured deer and really being unable to do anything.   It was! It was so curious, almost as if it'd never seen a human before. I think if my phone hadn't gone off mom would have eventually snapped anyway!"
Awwducational,2zu1g3,LicianDragon,4,Sun Mar 22 16:39:25 2015 UTC,"It's good for the fawn to be afraid of humans.  Too many people think all deer are like Bambi, and for every one rare Bambi encounter, there's a few dozen times where the deer, the human, a pet, or all of the above wind up the worse off.  :/"
Awwducational,2zu1g3,lunarblossoms,2,Sun Mar 22 16:43:39 2015 UTC,Agreed! I was trying to keep mom from charging and never expected the deer to get that close or I would have scared him off before it became and issue. Thankfully I think it turned out to be a bad experience for him anyways.

We had a bunny room that was kept super quiet for them. One day we got in excessive amounts of birds and someone had the bright idea of storing a crow in the rabbit room. An adult, very angry crow who needed medication 3 times per day.   ....Needless to say that didn't last long before someone pointed out how that was a terrible idea."
Awwducational,2zu1g3,lunarblossoms,18,Sun Mar 22 01:26:32 2015 UTC,Someone at the center where I used to help out moved an owl into the baby room because it was cold outside and the needed somewhere to put him over night. You know the room full of baby squirrels and bunnies? What a shocker none of them wanted to eat! The owl got booted to another sheltered room over night. It's a wonder we didn't lose any rabbits to all the hooting.
Awwducational,2zu1g3,Bird_Facts,14,Sun Mar 22 02:53:36 2015 UTC,"Bah, a rowdy crow with the rabbits.  I can't see that going well.  Gotta be super quiet AND they take so long to feed.  Rabbits are much better bunny parents than people."
Awwducational,2zu1g3,dishie,15,Sun Mar 22 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"The crow was cool until he needed to be handled in any way. Most people were afraid of him to boot, so they'd send me in there to get him, which was fine because I'm cool with being pecked up by a crow, it's not so bad (being confident about grabbing the animals is really important). Whereas I would just reach in there and grab the bugger, most interns were too timid to do so and would chase him around his cage for minutes as he screamed at them as loud as he could.   I have no idea why, in the time he was in there, nobody suggested rolling the cage (that was on wheels) out of the room to get him."
Awwducational,2zu1g3,Bird_Facts,7,Sun Mar 22 03:31:56 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, apparently you didn't suggest it either."
Awwducational,2zu1g3,dishie,5,Sun Mar 22 07:05:39 2015 UTC,"you're totally right. I questioned the initial order to put him in there, but it was reaffirmed that that's what was wanted to I went with it. I think - can't be sure - it may have been a temporary measure until we found a more permanent place for the bird cage, and he may have just been forgotten about by the supervisors. He only was in there for 2 days but that's 2 days too long!  Plus side, nothing negative came about it. IDK who it was that finally talked to the supervisor but he was moved one day to the squirrel room, which was mostly empty of squirrels, being mid-summer."

I'm an animal control officer and get tons of calls in the spring about birds that ""can't fly"". These birds are usually fledglings that just left the nest and will soon be able to fly away. Mom is typically not far either."
Awwducational,2zu1g3,Dysalot,36,Sun Mar 22 01:27:49 2015 UTC,This is true of most animals. Their maternal instinct is much stronger than their sense of smell. You shouldn't touch them (baby bunnies in particular) but this is because their intestinal flora isn't developed yet and human skin bacteria can be deadly on their delicate digestive tracts.
Awwducational,2zu1g3,Dysalot,12,Sun Mar 22 01:58:02 2015 UTC,What is the best way to pick them up? Do you use gloves? I'm always nervous to move baby birds because I'm always afraid my dirty human hands will do more harm than good :(
Awwducational,2zu1g3,Calamintha,18,Sun Mar 22 03:12:23 2015 UTC,"Wash your hands very very carefully with plain soap. If they start licking you (baby bunnies do this), move your hand to stop them. Put them into a clean shoebox lined with toilet tissue and take them back to their nest, to a nest with similar sized babies or to a wildlife rehabber."
Awwducational,2zu1g3,DodgyBollocks,2,Sun Mar 22 03:23:46 2015 UTC,"Would putting them in an area known to be trafficked by the mother work? A few year back our dog found a nest in a very poor spot.

Your more likely to draw a predator's attention to the nest than you are to transmit a disease to a baby bird. The exception being if you've just handled a domestic or pet bird, in which case, yes, wash up."
Awwducational,2zu1g3,JustZisGuy,12,Sun Mar 22 13:10:15 2015 UTC,Yup were just getting our first baby birds of the year and I'm already preparing my speech and questions to give and ask over the phone. If the nest has fallen we've even had good luck placing a basket in the tree (those strawberry containers are great!) and mama will visit it and feed the babies. Most of the time I'm just thrilled if it can be put back or returned to mama and we don't have to take it into care.
Awwducational,2zu1g3,VAPossum,29,Sun Mar 22 02:56:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! Being brought baby rabbits at the wildlife hospital I volunteered at meant we were very likely to have a depressing day in the near future.  Wild rabbits would rather starve than drink anything you offer them. Baby rabbits were automatically tube fed twice a day as there was no other way to get them to eat. Even this backfired once when a rabbit bit through the feeding tube getting it stuck in her stomach/esophagus. She wound up having to be euthanized but watching her in such distress and pain (rabbits can't vomit) was heartbreaking. Even if we could feed them, they'd often die anyway.  Wild rabbits also have vastly different dietary needs than domestics and a very delicate digestive tract. Our rabbits would often get doses of gut bacteria specific to them to help keep them healthy, especially if they also needed anti-biotics.  Rabbits are high stress animals. When we got an animal in the first thing we did was stabalize it if it was injured or immediately put it in a quiet, dark cage to keep it calm. Often we'd get rabbits that were grabbed by a dog, sometimes they had gruesome injuries (one had it's entire back degloved, he survived), others had no visible injuries but were frozen in terror. The stress of the attack, combined with the stress of handling, transport, and now being in a new environment seeing all the people as predators would cause them to die.   Wildlife hospitals work their asses off to help their animals survive and get released back into the wild. Some are easier than others to keep in captivity but it wasn't uncommon for us to lose an animal from stress induced cardiomyopathy.   It's always better to take an animal to a hospital where they have specialized training and knowledge on dietary needs, but more people need to understand when an animal truly needs help and when it just needs to be left alone or isn't in danger to begin with."

The order Pilosa comprises anteaters and sloths. The word comes from the Latin for 'hairy'. Anteaters form the suborder Vermilingua, which means 'worm tongue'. The term anteater is often applied to numbats, echidnas and pangolins as well as aardvarks yet none of them is a true anteater. The giant anteater was named Myrmecophaga tridactyla, meaning a three-fingered eater of ants, by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.

Awwducational,2z4lp6,StealYoGurll,10,Sun Mar 15 18:36:08 2015 UTC,Here is the WWF press release. It states 57 in the Russian population and up to 12 in the neighboring China population. The census was funded by WWF and most of the sources I am finding are citing them.
Awwducational,2z4lp6,StealYoGurll,6,Sun Mar 15 19:06:52 2015 UTC,Is 63 enough to sustain a healthy gene pool?
Awwducational,2z4lp6,StealYoGurll,7,Sun Mar 15 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"Not really. Inbreeding has already occurred, and further inbreeding in subsequent inbred population will lead, at the least, to a drop in fertility. This drop in fertility has also already been documented.    Studies have shown that the number of cubs per adult female fell to 1 in 1991 from 1.9 in 1973."
Awwducational,2z4lp6,TheBearHooves,4,Sun Mar 15 18:47:23 2015 UTC,So is this essentially an extinct species i'm looking at? Or is there a zoo breeding program?
Awwducational,2z4lp6,ButtsexEurope,5,Sun Mar 15 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"The genetic variation within the existing wild population is pretty low, comparable to that of the Florida panther or the asiatic lion. The captive population of amur leopards has a much healthier level of genetic variation, mostly because it has been mixed with a similar subspecies pantera pardus japonensis. So human intervention can help. As for the wild population, further intervention could include mixing individuals from the two amur leopard populations to ease the inbreeding bottleneck. Not extinct yet, but on a knife's edge to be sure.  Source: Conservation Genetics in the Far-Eastern Leopard (open access)"

An incredibly fascinating turn of roles due to age.  Really interesting Smithsonian article  Taken from the article, and this is really really interesting:   Theoretically, menopause should not exist. If the purpose of survival is reproduction, then there is no reason for an animal to stay alive when it can no longer have offspring. For killer whales, females stop reproducing at around 50 years old, which is also the age when most male killer whales are nearing the ends of their lives. Typically, though, post-menopausal females still have another 40 years to go."

If the female can no longer reproduce herself, it benefits her if she takes the reigns and helps her offspring or younger siblings (who all contain her DNA) to survive and reproduce. If she is doing the work of becoming leader it takes survival pressure off of those still of reproductive age. It's all a reproduction/genes game really.  Philosophically - I'm sure it feels pretty pleasant to pass on your knowledge to your children and family when you no longer have to worry about the pressures of having more children. It's a time for bonding as adults, sharing and maybe the joy of watching the others in the pod understand what you are teaching."

Awwducational,2z15dj,Glitchesarecool,15,Sat Mar 14 17:03:20 2015 UTC,"Fun story:  While visiting Costa Rica, one of our tour guides stopped  during our drive out to the hot springs (after what we officially call ""The Hell Hike"") to show us an RETF.  He hops out, hunts one down, brings it back to the van to show us all.  Now, my husband and I have kept these as pets before, so while it was awesome to see them, it was nothing out of the ordinary for us.  The [snooty] lady next to me (who had not been on the hike with us, but was just catching a ride to the springs), however, was not a fan.  So when the frog suddenly LEPT across me and straight onto her, the shrieks and and panic coming from her were both hilarious and tremendously exaggerated.  I calmly snagged the little bugger off of her before she smashed him, handed him back to the guide, and gave her a slightly judgemental look.  She spent the rest of the drive looking like she couldn't decide if she liked me for ""saving"" her or hated me for being Queen of the Frogs.  The moral of the story, of course, is that booking a vacation to Costa Rica is a really dumb idea if you're afraid of harmless wildlife."

There was a colony of these cats on my street and an older male developed a really bad case of mange. I took him to a shelter so at the very least he could be humanely euthanized. The first shelter absolutely refused to take him when they noticed his ear tip and told us to take him back to where we found him and basically let him die from the mange and exposure (it was nearly winter).

The woman I talked to was ""a big meanie"" (is that better /r/Awwducational bot?). I just cut my losses and left with him to find another shelter rather than argue. He was a friendly cat, just a bit hand-shy with being held so I wanted them to at least give him a chance to be treated and adopted. That place would have only let me pay to have him put down."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,LicianDragon,12,Sat Mar 14 01:20:28 2015 UTC,"Shelters have picked up an ideological hatred of cats, particularly feral cats and outdoor domestic cats. Here in Montreal, one shelter worker told me ""you're lucky you didn't get your cat from us, we make all our adopters sign contracts not to let their cats out, and we would seize her from you"". Seriously disgusting. They feel like they're supposed to shape the animal population instead of healing and fostering them.  This attitude, combined with their trigger happy resorting to the gas chamber with animals that could easily recover, really makes me think we nerd to rein these people in."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,TrotBot,22,Sat Mar 14 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"Given the population dynamics of feral cats it may be a cruel to be kind situation.  There are way too many cats out there for them to have decent homes, and the ones living in the wild tend to live miserable lives of disease and hunger, depleting local wildlife all the time.  Simply putting them down (or even just filling their ecological niches with non-breeding members) prevents the birth of a lot of kittens that'll live similarly miserable lives.  In Montreal I'd think that it'd be cold and urban enough that wouldn't be particularly relevant though.  I'd think diseased individuals would be apt to die off every winter and there wouldn't be much food for them other than garbage, pigeons and rats."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,JustJonny,2,Sat Mar 14 10:25:55 2015 UTC,"I'm a volunteer at a no-kill cat shelter. If people stopped letting their unneutered cats outside to breed, I would have a lot more free time. Those are the people who need to be reined in."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,mybloodyballentine,0,Sat Mar 14 10:25:58 2015 UTC,"I'm all for imposing neutering. I am not for imposing that all cats should be indoor cats. My cat is neutered, and I still got told that I would have had her taken from me."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,TrotBot,2,Sat Mar 14 16:24:44 2015 UTC,"I've only ever lived in New York City, and my bias against cats being outdoor animals comes from that. I respect your opinion and your rights, but it's hard for me to wrap my head around."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,mybloodyballentine,4,Sat Mar 14 17:08:31 2015 UTC,"That's insane! I really don't understand -some- shelters attitude towards cats. It seems they'll go to hell and back to save a single dog but if a cat has the slightest medical thing wrong with it or it's just the tiniest bit hand-shy it gets killed.  While I don't agree with outdoor cats myself (bad for local ecosystem and dangerous for the cat), it's not the shelters business as long as the person is giving the animal a good home. Besides, I know a few people who have outdoor cats, but have a cat-proof fenced in yard for them or a large kennel. Being outside for a cat doesn't always mean they're free to wander anywhere.  edit Clarifying that not all shelters hold this attitude, just a lot of the ones I've been too that weren't cat specific rescues."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,LicianDragon,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:26:39 2015 UTC,"But they have that problem with both cats and dogs. They can't save them all, that's true, but my point here was that I've seen multiple shelters that put far more effort into adopting out their dogs than their cats. If the first shelter I'd taken mine to couldn't take him, they should have referred me to another one themselves. Telling me to throw the cat back out onto the street with a severe case of mange was awful! No shelter, no matter how crowded or jaded, should ever tell someone to just leave a suffering cat or dog on the streets to die."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,LicianDragon,2,Sat Mar 14 01:41:34 2015 UTC,"The cat is a horribly invasive predator, all the more reason to NOT tell people to throw the animal back on the streets simply because they can't take it.   Feral cats I understand, but I know plenty of people who specifically adopt older cats. Maybe ASPCA's and city shelters can't handle the older cats but plenty of other rescues and shelters never euthanize a cat just because it's old."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,LicianDragon,6,Sat Mar 14 03:38:04 2015 UTC,"This entire thread is getting close towards generalizing. This attitude is not true of all shelters. In many places, they are the ones running the TNR service."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,FaceofHoe,2,Sat Mar 14 13:07:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I never meant to accuse all shelters of this mentality. It's just been my experience with many shelters that weren't cat specific rescues."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,LicianDragon,2,Sat Mar 14 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to ask what you mean by cat-proof fence?  I've never met a cat who didn't have 5'-6' vertical leap unless they were overweight.  Do that just have really, really tall fences without anything to climb on nearby?  Just curious because I've always had indoor cats that I would let accompany me outside, because they're not allowed out by themselves, just to get some fresh air.  I haven't had a cat that could be let alone out of the house by himself in years.  (A pair of brothers who didn't like being more than twenty or so feet from the door.)  I'd like to be able to allow future cats out in my backyard if I can make it safe."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,lindzasaurusrex,2,Sat Mar 14 15:59:28 2015 UTC,"It's essentially a standalone fencing system or an add-on to existing fence. They're typically 8' tall and made of a strong but flexible mesh making it really difficult to climb. The top of the fence is rounded over as well. There are also additions for trees to keep cats from climbing them.  I've also seen people get extra tall chain-link fencing, securing it at the bottom but not securing it near the top. If the cat climbs it, the fence sags down and the  cat can't climb over it.  They're all essentially the same but here are a few:  http://catfencein.com/  http://purrfectfence.com/default.asp  http://www.kittyfence.com/cat-fencing/  TBH with the pricing it looks like it'd be far easier and cheaper to set this up as a DIY project. It doesn't look all that complicated; I plan to do something similar for my ferrets whenever I get a house."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,LicianDragon,2,Sat Mar 14 07:50:29 2015 UTC,"That's actually really cool.  Those are super expensive though, so a DIY situation would probably be best.  The only problem I see with those is that you (probably) would get much wildlife like rabbits and squirrels in your backyard.  Not that I would want them in there for a cat to catch and kill but it is nice to watch them hop around and play so long as your cats aren't around.  I wish you luck for doing this with ferrets.  That sounds like it'll be hard as all get out, I'm guessing you'd probably have to use chicken wire for that."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,lindzasaurusrex,2,Sat Mar 14 13:04:54 2015 UTC,"Rabbits might be a problem but I've seen squirrels get over the fences no problem! :) They're much lighter and don't mind running upside down.  Thanks! Yup, chicken wire and I'll have to bury it at least 2ft down since they love digging so much!"
Awwducational,2yy1ca,LicianDragon,2,Sat Mar 14 16:37:54 2015 UTC,"and we would seize her from you   Not even joking, my older cats would rarely get outside but they'd always come home. Twice it took them a few days, but they always came home.   If I found someone had tried to take them while they were out or tried to take them from me because they were out, I would beat someone with a 2 by four.   ..I may have issues."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,KaziArmada,12,Sat Mar 14 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"I think their issue isn't that they think the cat won't come home, it's that cats kill a huge amount of wildlife every year so they consider loose cats to be a wildlife threat which they try and discourage."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,BraveSquirrel,-3,Sat Mar 14 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"While I can understand that, and it makes perfect logical sense...still..two by four."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,KaziArmada,2,Sat Mar 14 18:16:24 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, if someone killed my loved one I'd probably smack them upside the head too, no matter how they justify it."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,BraveSquirrel,-1,Sat Mar 14 16:37:57 2015 UTC,"Nope, you're perfectly sane. I also found irresistible violent urges rising within me when they were explaining this to me."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,TrotBot,2,Sat Mar 14 05:30:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering, and sparking this discussion.  Didn't know much about this issue.  I've taken a few birds to the local SPCA (which also treats wildlife) after they were injured by my cats, and sometimes they give me attitude about it.  But I'm a donor and just shrug them off anyway.  I understand their concerns, but their attitude does nothing to solve the problem."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,chazysciota,2,Sat Mar 14 09:30:32 2015 UTC,"No being rude about it definitely won't solve the problem. I've seen some cat-only rescues that did a really nice job politely and truthfully explaining why they believe cats shouldn't be left to free roam, none though ever refused to adopt a cat out just because the person would let it outside."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,LicianDragon,15,Sat Mar 14 09:31:38 2015 UTC,I adopted my tipped-ear cat from a humane society!

Awwducational,2yy1ca,cheeseless_gaps,5,Sat Mar 14 11:33:28 2015 UTC,"There's a huge difference between strays and ferals. Your cat was obviously a stray. Quite often, during the process of trap-neuter-release, it's discovered that the cat is very friendly and suitable for swanky indoor living. That's always the best outcome for these cats."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,mybloodyballentine,54,Sat Mar 14 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"I'm from Australia so it might be a bit different in the US but a wild cat, whether it has been neutered or not, is something that will be killing native birds and lizards :(  EDIT: Since a fair few people seem curious about this I will link this article which I believe to be credible and trustworthy. A few quotes from it:   ""It's estimated there are between 15 and 23 million wild cats living around continental Australia and its offshore islands."" ""It’s estimated feral cats eat 75 million native animals a night—more than 20 billion mammals, reptiles, birds and even insects every year."" ""‘[They] eat falcons and cockatoos, bats, centipedes, scorpions. I imagine that they would have a hard time pulling down a saltwater crocodile, I imagine that cassowaries would be pretty safe,  but virtually every lizard, every snake, every frog, every bat, just about every bird in Australia and any mammal smaller than a large kangaroo, at least when they are joeys, are all susceptible to cat predation.’""    The leading scientists from the article recommend culling via poisoned bait. Personally as a cat-lover I have trouble accepting that. However I am aware that at present it is carried out on foxes and that to prevent major extinction of Australian species it may be necessary. Several alternatives are mentioned in the article."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,Forgotten_Lie,28,Sat Mar 14 16:01:46 2015 UTC,"It really does depend on the area. I live in LA, and the urban sprawl is so big that cats are generally useful to have around town. Pigeons, crows, and rodent's aren't exactly endangered here."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,KargBartok,18,Sat Mar 14 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of dispute on the subject, but trap-neuter-release programs are intended to be a humane method of reducing feral cat populations over time, therefore sparing wildlife.  It seems clear to me that simply culling ferals once in a while won't have much effect since newly abandoned cats and any survivors will quickly breed back their numbers. Either there has to be a sustained effort to keep culling feral cats (and poisoned bait has its own impact on wildlife), or some alternative has to be found. Trap-neuter-release is one attempt."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,uglyfatslug,9,Sat Mar 14 07:10:34 2015 UTC,Australia   You could introduce a natural predator to cats and let nature run its course...

Awwducational,2yy1ca,Dashtego,-7,Sat Mar 14 09:47:47 2015 UTC,"It's always a ""joy"" when people try to put a positive spin on eradacating a species... It's a lazy choice, among other things. Also, sometimes their data is wrong, but they are persuaded it's correct and so make desicions based on it. I am a cat-lover, so this brings a particular pain, but destroying any creature because they can't find a better solution is infuriating. How quickly people choose to kill... Cats are a problem, but humans aren't. Right."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,CelestialDustBunnies,13,Sat Mar 14 10:22:23 2015 UTC,"It's not eradicating, cats exist outside of Australia.  And it's an invasive species that's contributing to the extinction of many native Australian species that don't exist anywhere else.  I like cats, I have two and one's nuzzling my ankle as I type this, but wiping out the Australian feral cat population (to the very limited degree that's feasible) is probably the right course of action.  People are choosing to kill because cats choose to kill.  If cats blended into the ecosystem as stably as European dear or camels, it would be a non-issue.   15 and 23 million wild cats   There are literally about as many cats as humans in Australia.  Cats are probably a bigger ecological problem than humans, aside from the fact that humans introduced cats, rabbits, and rats in the first place."

People are choosing to kill cats because cats eat... I am aware that it would be more expensive, but it's better than killing (I can't believe I have to defend not killing), to spay/neuter them. Money is waisted on frivolous things everyday, I hope you agree this is not the case. I'm simply angered by the fact that it's so acceptable to kill."

The question isn't whether killing will happen, it's a simply question whether it'll be minimized.  If cats could somehow eat in a way that wouldn't devastate entire ecosystems, they'd be tolerated, just like the deer and camels."

Awwducational,2yy1ca,WeAreAlsoTrees,8,Sat Mar 14 15:18:01 2015 UTC,"We recently started feeding our second tipped ear kitty. The first has been around over 5 years. She's a precious little lady that doesn't understand indoor life, but she will come inside the back door to the kitchen to eat her kibble. And, omg, does she love affection. We call her porch kitty cuz that's where she lives.   Our newest feeder is a giant (like, biggest cat I've ever laid hands on) male orange tabby. He's the same way! Loves affection, eats all the food, can't stand being inside with the backdoor closed. I'd love to tame them both and keep them inside, but they prefer the yard be their home. Which is good because they do not understand the litter box.   It's weird because I always thought tipped kitties were catch and release ferrel cats, but these little fluffy love balls are so far from ferrel. They just really seem to prefer living in the yard and having the security of food and water every day. And maybe they're just so grateful that they offer their bellies for rubs? In any case, I'm happy that they've decided the reprieve we provide for them from stray kitty life warrants their vigilant guard in our yard against vermin and cockroaches.   And that's my tipped ear kitty story I felt compelled to share!"

Less traumatic and a definite sign of a mark made on purpose. I can think of a dozen natrual events that would cause an ear tear on a feral animal.

Some cats lose parts of their ears through fighting, and it might resemble a surgical cut from afar so I don't find this to be a solution. And they don't have to make it visible eather, it may help them to not bring them in to get spayed/neutered, if that's what they are aiming for, but they can take the longer route, chip them and create a profile of the cat and check it every time. Cutting their ears... Yeesh."
Awwducational,2yy1ca,MyrrhFlower,10,Sat Mar 14 16:49:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of people trapping the cats are (mostly untrained) volunteers. Aside from not having a chip scanner (and the fact that microchips can move and not be found by a scanner), trappers also try to minimize the contact with the cat. Feral cats can be aggressive and hurt volunteers and themselves when trapped.   Ear tipping seems archaic, but it allows for even the most untrained volunteer to easily identify and release the cats that have already been spayed/neutered. Traps (self closing cages) are set with food overnight, and volunteers check for cats the next morning/after a few hours. At that distance, it is easy to see a surgical tipped cat vs. Ear damaged cat due to fighting.   Without an easy identification, cats that were already fixed through the program would be brought in more than once. Ear tipping is a simple, cheap, method of identification that any trapper can recognize.   I'm not saying ear tipping is the best, permanent global solution. But it does have a very sound and logical purpose."

Awwducational,2yxb4w,sumfish,6,Fri Mar 13 22:20:57 2015 UTC,It's so upsetting when we have so much evidence that the world's climate and overexploitation has reached this point yet so many people refuse to acknowledge it. We are currently going through the world's sixth great extinction.  The Earth hasn't lost species at this rate since the End Cretaceous 66 million years ago. And IT IS OUR FAULT.
Awwducational,2yxb4w,SimianSidekickV6,-1,Sat Mar 14 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"It's El Nino, and happens every few years and has happened for basically for ever as far as we are concerned."
Awwducational,2yxb4w,sumfish,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:04:25 2015 UTC,"99% of climate scientist - people who devote their lives to studying the patterns and changes in our atmosphere - agree that anthropogenic climate change is real.  Studies show that the last time the earth had this warm of an annual temperature was 15 million years ago.  Coincidentally, that was about the last time the concentration of CO2 was as high as it is today.      But sure, let's just blame it on El Nino."
Awwducational,2yxb4w,SimianSidekickV6,-1,Tue Mar 17 22:18:24 2015 UTC,"Nice straw man argument Mr parrot. I didn't say a word about climate change or who believes or don't believe. I simply stated that this particular event is caused by el nino, and happens every time there is one.  Worse than the climate deniers are the idiots that attribute every nice day to global warming."
Awwducational,2yxb4w,sumfish,2,Wed Mar 18 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"So scientists who cite the work of others are parrots?  You do realize that would invalidate just about every single scientist out there? Yes, El Nino causes issues and can mess up natural cycles when it happens, but the changing climate is making these weather patterns far more extreme than ""normal"".     How is it better to deny the fact we're royally screwing up our one habitable planet than to try to make the world a better place and maybe be wrong abut climate change? In one scenario, we make the earth a nicer place to live.  In the other, we go extinct.      If you want to continue discussing this, please refrain from the insults."

The logic being that any animal that is that huge can do massive damage to another grizzly, so often a fight would be to the death. At least to a terrible scar. In order to avoid this, they pull out a quite a bit of bluffing and bravado to get their points across."
Awwducational,2ysyma,shitsfuckedupalot,11,Thu Mar 12 20:52:31 2015 UTC,I second this. Male Grizzlies are incredibly territorial. Especially in locations where food sources are abundant.

The sneeze is an autonomous reflex caused by the prolonged irritation in the nasal from growling.  Sure, this could be playful, but it could also be from genuine aggression.

Awwducational,2yk13s,psychothumbs,24,Tue Mar 10 15:58:06 2015 UTC,"The Wikipedia link on moose aggression from OP below states that moose are naturally aggressive when they feel threatened (or during the mating season, or when they're annoyed, or when they're being denied their regular human food), whereas the Wikipedia article on bears says that they tend to be shy when confronted by humans - so it does sound like there's a real difference in the ""fight or flight"" patterns in moose and bears.  I remember living in Alaska, we were always taught to run away from moose, especially a mama and her calf, because of the danger of being charged. Whereas we could just wear a bear bell when out in the wilderness, and that would usually keep bears away."

I think my heart stopped and dropped down into my stomach.   Someone was out walking with their dogs off leash on the same path that early in the morning.   Later the same day, we saw a bear lumbering around a parking lot to a nature reserve. We stayed back and headed for our car, when all the other tourists pull out their phone and cameras and start heading towards the bear."

Winners get to drive their personal vehicles the length of the park road (92 miles) weather permitting.  Since it's the edge of winter, the lottery winners are largely Alaskans.  And when they see a bear, they get out of their cars and crowd way too close for safety, oohing and aww-ing like anybody else.  Outnumbered rangers yell at the crowd but to little effect.  Fortunately the bear is usually very busy (grubbing termites, eating late berries) and ignores the crowd."

Awwducational,2ym0dn,Alantha,8,Tue Mar 10 22:26:33 2015 UTC,"It may not be super aww, but both monkeys are pretty cute! Aside from a great National Geographic article on this Radio Lab had a podcast called ""Patient Zero"" that also discusses the jumping of disease from animals to humans. The less virulent HIV-2 virus likely came from the sooty mangabey monkeys.  Zoonosis is the scientific term for these diseases and there are of course many examples (Influenza, Rabies, Ebola, Anthrax, etc.). Ebola is the most recent one in the news and scientists think it may have originated in an insect-eating bat, National Geographic also did an interesting article on this."
Awwducational,2ym0dn,remotectrl,3,Tue Mar 10 22:28:03 2015 UTC,"This was the response to the Nat Geo article from Merlin Tuttle, the founder of Bat Conservation International:   Catching bats may not always be easy, but it is far easier than catching most other mammals. Many years ago, while leading field teams for the Smithsonian Institution, I personally supervised the collection of many thousands of mammals, from rodents and bats to monkeys and large carnivores. I also developed the modern bat trap that medical teams now most often rely on to catch bats. Bats form conspicuous colonies of hundreds, thousands or even millions of individuals and are exceptionally vulnerable to capture. One bat trap can catch hundreds or even thousands of bats in a single evening. Imagine trying to catch similar numbers of virtually any other mammal, for example monkeys or carnivores. As early as 2005, it was known that large numbers of African dogs could harbor Ebola virus without themselves becoming sick, and lab studies have shown that there are also other mammals who can survive Ebola infection, thus serving as potential reservoirs or intermediate hosts. It is quite possible that the disproportionate focus on bats, though temptingly easy, has hindered progress toward finding a true source.  Years of intensive effort to document fruit-eating bats as the source of Ebola have resulted in nothing more than speculation with no credible proof, a fact that is tacitly admitted now that the focus appears to be switching to insect-eating bats. The two-year-old boy, believed to have been the first victim of the current outbreak, was first speculated to have been bitten by a fruit bat, generating headlines, but not very plausible stories. Now the researchers who first blamed fruit bats, seem equally confident that he got Ebola from an insect-eating species, still with no hard evidence. How about dogs or the countless other critters that were at least equally likely to have been contacted? Isn’t it about time to investigate alternative possibilities? We must be more careful to avoid the temptation to grab readers with premature speculation that has the potential to reverse decades of conservation progress on behalf of ecologically essential animals. People do kill the animals they fear.   I tend to agree, though bats certainly do carry diseases, but you'd kind of expect that from the second most diverse clade of mammals. I suspect that you can find new and scary viruses in lots of different hosts and bats have gotten a lot of attention as possible and confirmed reservoirs in recent years."

It formed naturally in chimps and they was transferred to humans from chimp hunters and spread from there. I'm not sure why you'd think it was bioengineered, but that is very incorrect.

So these dumbasses fall out of trees all the time, but they land ok.   The only problem is that if they get scared while in a tree, their defense mechanism is falling - it's an evolutionary response to snakes, their only natural predators. However, these days, their worst predators are dogs. So, if a dog corners them in a tree, they will get scared and fall down to the dog waiting at the bottom. Poor, stupid idiots."

Whether or not this works by attracting bats or deterring pest activity (some insects can hear bats and will try to avoid being eaten) is unknown and more studies should be conducted!  Some fruit bats also seem to use each other to find food by smelling each other. If a bat comes back to the roost smelling like a newly available fruit the other bats will know its in season and search for it on subsequent nights.

Awwducational,2y17ol,cheeseburger_humper,30,Thu Mar 5 17:45:48 2015 UTC,"So as a groomer, I can comment on this...  Bathe them a few times a year. Like 4-6. Each bathing session takes a total of about 12-14 hours (drying included in that). Each flock must be soaped and dried individually for best result.   If one of the flocks starts to smell of mildew (like an old tent) my suggestion would be to take off that specific flock, though I know groomers that might use tar and sulfur shampoo, a vinegar 10:1 solution, or some Nature's Miracle solution.  Edit: Since a lot of people are asking about the drying process, I found a vet's blog about his Pulis, another corded breed. Here's some of his tips.   The length of time he needs to stay in the dryer will depend on the form of the cords - how densely each cord is packed. Never use heat for drying a Puli. Being strong willed, a Puli is capable of objecting so strenuously to being mistaken for a lobster that he fusses himself into heat stroke, not from the heat of the dryer as much as the heat of his frustration. The safest and most comfortable dryer is as follows:  Build a platform tall enough to set a large (18"") high velocity fan underneath. Obtain 2 fans with a lifetime guarantee - like a Patton fan - and set one underneath pointing straight up. (See why you want that guarantee?) Place your dog’s cage, which should be of the small mesh construction, upside down (if necessary) over a hole cut in the top of the platform, just a bit smaller than the dimensions of the cage. Upside down the pan can be left out without the Puli falling through the cracks! Place the Puli in the cage and position the second fan in front and at the same level as the cage. Turn on both fans, and retreat from earshot for the appropriate number of hours. Don’t worry about the Puli in this arrangement if the crate is secure on top of the stand and the stand is securely built. I usually do this before bedtime, and leave him in overnight. This is a sufficient length of time to dry most dogs, at least if the wringing and sweatshirting have proceeded as above, and he’s usually the most comfortable one in the house; a breeze in his face, white noise, the cage he’s used to sleeping in anyway (well, in some cases). If it’s cool where he is add a commercial dryer on top to slightly warm the air - that’s all it will do with an open wire crate and two fans. You really won’t endanger your dog with this setup.  You definitely do have to rig up something like this if you are going to keep your Puli in a full corded coat. You may be able to tolerate the smell of your darling if he isn’t completely dry, but believe me, no one else will and you will be guilty of smearing the reputation of the whole breed! Could you live with that knowledge? If you don’t dry him thoroughly, in 2 or 3 days, bacteria will bloom inside the warm, damp centers of the cords, and your Puli will reek. It’ll be much worse than he smelled before the effort and agony of the bath. After you’ve removed your guy from the drying cage, check him again in a few hours to see if capillary action has pulled moisture out to the dry outer layers from still wet inner layers. If so, in again for another 3 hours or so. He hates it when he reeks and people avoid him, and you will pay for it!"

Awwducational,2xzpym,wingmanly,5,Thu Mar 5 16:23:10 2015 UTC,"Source  Pic source  Basically, when holland lops came to America there were only solid colors. But they wanted broken, so they bred to english spots, but the resulting rabbits had flyback fur (fur that when rubbed back immediately flies back to normal position) instead of the desired roll back (goes back to normal position slower). So they bred to French angoras ( because they had a rollback fur) and got the desired broken coat. But now the Hollands had the recessive gene, causing some pairings to have wooly kits. At first these weren't desired and were just sold as pets or dog foods or whatever, but then they decided, hey, let's make them a breed.   The breed standard calls for (essentially) a holland lop with wool."

Awwducational,2xxjj1,c8lou,15,Thu Mar 5 04:34:57 2015 UTC,Honest question sorry if it's dumb: Do horses get cold enough that they need a jacket of some sort?  I ask because my Italian Greyhound is like a little miniature horse and she needs a jacket in the winter... That .00001 body fat and eyelash hair does little for her.  Same thing with a horse I imagine.
Awwducational,2xxjj1,zeezle,26,Thu Mar 5 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"Thin coated and light-boned horses like the Akhal-teke should be blanketed if left outside in the cold, that's for sure. There's a whole 'thing' about when to blanket a horse. If you don't, they grow a heavier coat, which can be less than ideal for showing and riding."
Awwducational,2xxjj1,use_more_lube,10,Thu Mar 5 01:17:51 2015 UTC,I had absolutely no idea that horses can grow hair any longer than a short length.  So wild horses have the means of staying warm on their own as domesticated as they are?
Awwducational,2xxjj1,Toyland_in_Babes,15,Thu Mar 5 01:22:53 2015 UTC,"Wild horses will grow quite a shaggy coat during the winter, as will owned horses, provided they don't live in an extremely warm place or don't get blanketed heavily every day/kept indoors. Then they shed it and it's the worst. You never escape the hair."
Awwducational,2xxjj1,c8lou,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:22:54 2015 UTC,Soooo much shedding
Awwducational,2xxjj1,somanyroads,10,Thu Mar 5 17:16:09 2015 UTC,"Most breeds of horses can survive outdoors and unblanketed in a pretty wide variety of climates. For example, I used to own an Arabian, and he was absolutely fine being left unblanketed in the winter in the mountains in Virginia. If I lived in, say, Massachussetts, he'd just grow a thicker coat.   He just turned into an adorable little fluffball in the winter, and in spring it all sheds into the sleek, shiny, beautiful coat most people associate with well-groomed domesticated horses (just in time for show season!)."
Awwducational,2xxjj1,nabgi,7,Thu Mar 5 04:52:55 2015 UTC,"They sure do!  Some get absolutely fuzzy.   Here's a moderately fuzzy horse   and here's a hugely fuzzy pony  Here's a younger horse with some fur clipped and you can see how very long the hair gets.   Many people keep their horses clipped for convenience. There are a number of ways to do this - but it means they have to be kept blanketed when it gets cold.    But Mustangs and Chincoteague Ponies and other stabilized populations of feral horses learn where the sheltered places are and they become uniquely adapted to their environments.   Even Arabians can grow warmer coats, because the desert can get freaking cold at nights."

Awwducational,2xxjj1,nabgi,15,Thu Mar 5 07:08:20 2015 UTC,"I really love the Akhal-Teke breed.  They carry strongly the sooty gene which in the picture is the black along the back that's extending downward. It creates beautifully colored horses.   The ""shiny"" coat is mostly related to the brown colorings (palomino, buckskin... Etc). Scientists never figured out where it came from, the last I read.  A Teke won a gold metal in the olympics for dressage. They are super athletic, but little butt heads. They are an intensely loyal breed and intelligent. Theyre used in all sorts of disciplines, and commonly crossed with TBs to give them endurance. Tekes are used as race horses too. They run long distance races like Arabians do.   Theyre pretty rare to find outside of Eastern Europe/Russia/Turkenmisten (because I'm fabulous at remembering where their population largely is and spelling).  I want to import a Teke one day. It'll be a pretty penny but god. I love this breed.  Edit: I forgot to add! Tekes do have makes but they're usually shaved down because its a breed standard! Theyre none for thin hair along the neck!"

Their defining characteristics were cloven hoofs (unlike horses), a long, single horn, and incredible shyness. Apparently they could only be caught by virgins. I'm pretty sure J. K. Rowling started the thing about silver and gold coats - at least in popular culture today. I don't know if it's come up in the past. All of the drawings of unicorns I saw as a kid (pre-Harry Potter) were white.  It's pretty unlikely that the sorts of people who were writing down stories about unicorns in England and Europe would have seen these horses in Turkmenistan."
Awwducational,2xxjj1,ewhetstone,12,Thu Mar 5 03:25:53 2015 UTC,"They're also supposedly one of the most difficult breeds of horses to train, largely due to their higher intelligence and vigorous personalities.

To put the nutritional value of guano into perspective, we concurrently analysed a hamburger with the other samples. Bat guano had nearly twice the crude protein content and almost two-thirds of the calories as the sampled hamburger: McDonald's Corporation Big Mac sandwich contained 23% crude protein and 6139 cal g−1 (dry matter basis). Unlike the faeces of many animals, bat guano is still rich in calories and nutrients. To meet the energetic demands of flight and reproduction, insectivorous bats such as M. grisescens have evolved extremely short digestive tracts and rapid food transit times."
Awwducational,2xu8l7,remotectrl,3,Tue Mar 3 22:40:56 2015 UTC,"It's no wonder that cave salamanders eat it. And lots of mite species do too! And other stuff! This poop study was undertaken on a colony of bats living in an actual belfry.  It's easy to tell insectivorous bat feces from mouse droppings because although they are roughly the same size, the bat feces will glitter due to the small fragments of chitinous exoskeletons. It will also crumble when touched, but mouse droppings become hard as they dry.  Those insect skeletons are touch enough that they actually take a good bit of the digestive epithelial cells with them, making it possible to do genetic testing on feces and determine which bat species left it behind! Some researchers in Oregon have used this to monitor bat populations indirectly.  Subscribe to /r/batfacts for more Guano News!"

These probably evolved to reduce weight to help with flying. It's was probably easier to eat more and process it poorly than be weighed down trying to get more out of it. You see a similar thing with geese who digest very little of their food (compared to other herbivores) but eat a lot of it instead."

Awwducational,2xk8wi,triggerhappy899,2,Mon Mar 2 04:20:15 2015 UTC,Honey badgers are preyed upon by lions and jaguars and would need camoflauge to reduce their risk of predation. On the other end of the spectrum however if they are hunting camoflauge is also useful to hide them from their prey. Xforce is very likely correct in their explanations.
Awwducational,2xk8wi,cnelsonsic,0,Mon Mar 2 20:23:43 2015 UTC,Honey badgers don't ambush prey. They just outright lunge at it. There's no need for camouflage if you're doing a direct assault like that.
Awwducational,2xk8wi,DrPossum,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:22:15 2015 UTC,Xforce is likely correct in this. Having a white mane or white stripe would be an example of convergent evolution for camouflage in a grassland biome. Though honey badgers are tough animals they are still preyed upon by jaguars and lions (carefully) and would need camouflage. Mimicry between species is a much rarer occurrence than convergent evolution anyway and usually natural selection will take the easiest path.

Awwducational,2xk8wi,BuddhasLittleWarlock,2,Sun Mar 1 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"Lots of animal behavior studies use fake animals when they can't use real ones. So you'd make some really convincing stuffed animal cheetah cubs. Some would have the white tuft and some wouldn't. You'd probably make them smell right too. Then you'd look at the behavior of a live predator. You'd compare its behavior towards the two different cub models and a honey badger model. You can compare the behaviors to see if the predator is reacting similarly to the tufted cheetah as it would to a honey badger.  If cheetahs weren't endangered, you could do pretty much the same thing but actually shave and dye the white tuft. You still wouldn't let the predator eat them, though."

Awwducational,2xgtb6,who8877,11,Sun Mar 1 01:33:22 2015 UTC,"Humans introduced them and threw off the natural ecosystem. Like many invasive species, they severely reduce biodiversity and can completely take areas over to where there are hardly any others left.   If an animal/plant manages to introduce itself to an area, the effect usually isn't so severe. Take the cattle egret for example. They flew across the pacific ocean to get to America and once here, took advantage of empty niches created due to our large numbers of cattle/horses providing the fields for them to live.  They haven't upset the ecosystem in any major way and only took advantage of a change humans had already made (still not a plus but that's a different argument). They even help ranchers by controlling pests such as ticks and biting flies.  Starlings have only been here ~125yrs, house sparrows ~165 depending on which of the introductions you go by. That's a mere eye blink in time regarding animal/ecosystem adaptations. You can argue that in a few thousand years both species will have settled into a more normal reltionship in the environment relative to natives but they're a problem caused by humans. They're not supposed to be here and to preserve what little bit of biodiversity we have remaining, their numbers need to be thinned along with those of other invasive's like the asian carp, asian clam, emerald ash bore beetle, gypsy moth, kudzu, and japanese honeysuckle. And those are just a small number of invasive's in my state alone."
Awwducational,2xgtb6,LicianDragon,4,Sun Mar 1 01:54:01 2015 UTC,"To clarify,  Would animals introduced by ice bridges, land bridges, or other natural phenomena be invasive if it occurred less than a few thousand years ago?  Spiders for example can float thousands of kilometers using their silk as a sail.  It's conceivable a lucky one could make an ocean crossing.  I'm not trying to be obtuse, I've just never really understood where the line between invasive and natural was."
Awwducational,2xgtb6,who8877,6,Sun Mar 1 01:57:33 2015 UTC,"It's a blurry line, but it's there. Think of it this way, the animals that got here over the land bridges got here when maize was still a 1-2 kernel grass, before the Aztecs domesticated it. An ecosystem can tolerate change, but abrupt changes (like throwing a bunch of non-native animals out your window into Central Park because you're an asshole) can make big ripples in the local ecosystem. Look up the Zebra Mollusk and it's introduction into North America, that's a pretty good example too.  Hope that helps."

Awwducational,2xgtb6,tomanonimos,3,Sun Mar 1 03:28:22 2015 UTC,"Nope. To go back to my cattle egret example, they only arrived in the states back in 1941 but aren't considered invasive.  Invasive is any animal introduced by humans whether on purpose or not. A natural or native animal is one that got there by every other mean such as natural migration/evolution. Clearly they still have an effect on the natural ecosystem but it's not usually to the magnitude of invasive's and the effect they do have comes about much slower.  You can also have natives that essentially become invasive's in behavior due to the way our species tends to fuck things up. The cowbird is native to the eastern US but lives in open grasslands on the edges of forests. They're brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds while destroying the other eggs (the chicks may even push the other eggs out and outcompete those that survive). With deforestation, forest habitats are now increasingly fragmented and smaller and this bird can further impact other species now having access to more habitat. We now have to treat this species almost like an invasive and actively control it's population. I had a pair of grackles living by my old college dorm that never successfully raised their own chicks due to cowbirds parasitizing their nest every year.   The outlook of us ever truly getting rid of invasive's is pretty darn slim so I'm sure sometimes in the far, far future they won't be considered invasive's anymore, but at least for now, they're big trouble."
Awwducational,2xgtb6,who8877,1 point,Sun Mar 1 03:49:51 2015 UTC,Honestly the only time an invasive species belongs is if either the ecosystem adapts to them or they change the ecosystem so much that it is detrimental to remove the invasive species. I've never heard of the latter happening.
Awwducational,2xgtb6,tomanonimos,1 point,Sun Mar 1 02:13:09 2015 UTC,Is it not fair to argue that if the species doesn't cause the extinction of another they are increasing bio-diversity and are therefore a good thing?
Awwducational,2xgtb6,Renegade_Meister,1 point,Tue Mar 3 06:02:17 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of ecosystems that have invasive species that dont cause extinctions but they cause all the natural species or some of the natural species to lose their population number and generally take a slippery slope to being endangered/threatened.   If there are no ramification to the organisms of a ecosystem, the invasive species are damaging the land itself; Pleco's in Texas, because of their burrowing technique of nesting, are causing damages to the levees and banks of rivers which is increasing erosion and decreasing the stability of these banks."

Awwducational,2xckr4,Elementium,1 point,Sat Feb 28 04:32:01 2015 UTC,i was going to ask if these birds are located in Guatemala. thank you for answering before i had to google it
Awwducational,2xckr4,jscreamer,21,Sat Feb 28 05:48:27 2015 UTC,"Quetzal facts!    Resplendent Quetzals (the species pictured here) are celebrated as symbols of freedom; it has been said that quetzals would rather kill themselves than stay in captivity. However, it turns out that they just have special housing requirements! There are now a number of successful captive breeding programs. Quetzals are members of a bird group called Trogons. Despite their bright colors, they can be very difficult to see as they are usually pretty quiet and still in their forest homes. Like owls, they can turn their heads 180 degrees to keep an eye on potential predators behind them. There is one species of trogon that lives in North America (barely) - it's called an Elegant Trogon."
Awwducational,2xckr4,Nantosuelta,3,Fri Feb 27 18:49:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe you would know. Do the females select their mate according to the length of the tail feathers?   If so, this could be a really cool selection process. Presumably, a bird that is better at aquiring food can grow a longer tail. This would mean he has some kind of advantage that ought to be passed on."
Awwducational,2xckr4,WakeAndVape,8,Fri Feb 27 20:29:01 2015 UTC,"That's generally the hypothesis behind spectacular sex-specific ornaments like this, and male quetzals definitely do display their long tails to females during courtship ""dances"". However I don't know offhand if female quetzals actually choose males based on tail length...    There has been research on other birds with long tails (like male Widowbirds) that shows female preference for long tails. Generally there appears to be a link between male health/genetic quality/dominance/etc. and the quality of his ornaments, but it isn't always so straightforward...    The spectacular peacock is a great example - while males with artificially plucked tails were ignored by females, scientists were surprised to find that the symmetry and number of eyespots on a male's tail aren't that important in female choice, even though the number of eyespots is correlated with immune system strength! Whether or not females ""care"" about certain aspects of male ornaments may vary by population or over time, and it may not be quite so black-and-white as we often assume."

If falling out of trees is the issue for new world porcupines to the prehensile tailed porcupines also have antibiotics even if they hardly ever fall out of trees being such good climbers.  Do the antibiotic properties increase with tree dwelling or decrease with increased climbing ability?  What about the new world Stump-tailed porcupine?

Awwducational,2wo9i8,MajorLzr,38,Sat Feb 21 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"I shared this discovery earlier this week on /r/batfacts  This is a pretty recent discovery. There are also moths which jam bat echolocation by making their own ultrasonic clicks and some moths evolved ears to hear bats so they can evade/avoid them.  Here's a write up on the discovery and here's the paper.   Luna moths with tails experienced a 47 percent higher survival advantage over moths without tails, which is the same benefit moths with ears specialized for detecting the sonar signal of echolocating bats receive. Bats targeted the tail during 55 percent of the interactions, suggesting the moths may lure bats to the tails—non-essential appendages.   This gif is slowed down six times normal speed and features a big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) attacking a luna moth (Actias luna). Big brown bats are fairly common in these sorts of studies and this may not be a naturally predator-prey interaction in the wild, though other similar bats probably do take Luna moths. Many different moth species have similar tails suggesting that bat predation may have played a role in such adaptations. Some butterflies also have tails for similar defense against birds."

Conspecific signal jamming may be widespread in bats. We don't know yet, but we do know they eavesdrop on each other to find food and will call dibs on prey items in at least some species.

Awwducational,2wfsd2,legitsh1t,69,Thu Feb 19 17:55:12 2015 UTC,Yea this sounds a bit crazy. So I used the internet. http://www.dairymoos.com/how-much-milk-do-cows-give/ OP is full of it and cows only produce around 70lbs of milk a day. Even then that's very impressive so I don't understand the need for exaggeration. To be fair the record is a cow that produced nearly 210 lbs a day.

Awwducational,2wfsd2,cashcow,2,Thu Feb 19 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit more than 10% maybe as high as 20%, there's some variance based on breed for both cows and goats. But naturally a cow shouldn't be producing more than 20kg of milk in a day, if they're producing more they've been over-bred for milk production and can't survive fully on grass/hay, and generally you won't find any goats that have been bred for milk the way cows have, so that would be the most fair comparison. 8kg of milk in a day would be ~40% of that, and there aren't any 200kg goats, so it's not fully proportional."

Awwducational,2wfsd2,dustyjuicebox,3,Thu Feb 19 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"A single cow != any given cow, so if you have info that tells you the record is 210lbs, then 160lbs is certainly what some cows can produce.  Also, comparing averages is a bit silly, purely grass fed cows won't produce over 45lbs in a day, highly bred grain fed cows will produce significantly more, and cow breeds that are suitable for dairy and meat will produce less."
Awwducational,2wfsd2,anonlymouse,4,Thu Feb 19 20:35:34 2015 UTC,Average is the only way to compare in this situation. If you want to go through every possible goat and cow in this country feel free but as op's title and source read they implied averages.
Awwducational,2wfsd2,dustyjuicebox,2,Thu Feb 19 20:42:56 2015 UTC,"OP's title has a range, which clearly doesn't imply averages."
Awwducational,2wfsd2,anonlymouse,3,Thu Feb 19 20:47:06 2015 UTC,Even if we took ops lower range of milk of 12lbs that is no where near about 10% of 70 lbs. So the ranges are wrong. Plus about 10% does imply an average that is near 10%.
Awwducational,2wfsd2,dustyjuicebox,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:55:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on the country being compared, there's a 40-fold difference in average production between the US and Tanzania for instance."

Awwducational,2wfsd2,dollflour,16,Thu Feb 19 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"In Chinese, it is the year of the 羊, which is a generic sheep. Goats are 山羊 (mountain sheep); rams are 公羊 (male sheep). Year of the sheep is correct, and year of the ram/goat is for pretentious people who want to act fancy.   same with year of the boar/pig. That's 猪, or a generic pig. Boar is 公猪 (male pig) or 山猪 (mountain pig).   It always makes me wonder why these people who insist on calling it something other than the generic sheep didn't choose to call it the year of the Ewe. It just seems kind of sexist to me. Besides, if we're using the female gender, we can have awesome years like the year of the Bitch.   Edit: If they want to call it the year of the goat and the year of the boar, assuming they're using the mountain version of that animal, I propose we start calling the year of the dog as the year of the Coyote (山狗/mountain dog) instead, for consistency. Although, I still feel the year of the Bitch is more interesting."

Awwducational,2wfsd2,OsmanthusJelly,-1,Fri Feb 20 08:54:03 2015 UTC,"綿羊   Yes and no. 羊 is a generic sheep. 綿羊 is a clothing/rug fiber producing sheep. I happened to spin fiber from various wool, so I can speak to this. Not all sheep wool are appropriate for yarn making. At the same time, this is splitting hair. If someone calls a sheep 綿羊, no one's going to say they're wrong. If you call a goat (山羊) a sheep (羊), more than a few people will raise an eyebrow, because that is wrong. No ifs and buts about it.   Edit: You are right that coyote is more often called a 郊狼, but at the same time, I'm also correct that it is called a 山狗, just not as often. If you're looking for the mountain version of a dog, then 山狗 is a coyote.   It seems to me that your Chinese is pretty good. If it's your second language, then props to you for knowing that a coyote is called a 郊狼."

Awwducational,2wfsd2,OsmanthusJelly,3,Fri Feb 20 07:02:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know what to tell you, but a generic 羊 is (80% of the time) not a goat.   Your Wikipedia leads to 羊亚科 (Caprinae), which includes ALL sheep and goats. That's a scientific differentiation, not the type of differentiation we are talking about here. As far as terminology and definition is concerned, the generic 羊 is a sheep and not a goat. I'm not even sure why we're arguing over this, because it is a pointless argument.   If you ever go to China and Taiwan and happen to go to the zoo, watch kids when they see the animals. They'll almost never call a goat just 羊. A goat is a type of 羊, but more accurately, it is a 山羊. When they see sheep, it is very likely that they will say 羊 instead of 綿羊, because for sheep, the two terms are (nearly) interchangeable.   I can't believe I'm trying to find proof for this, but if you look at trinkets people make for sheep year, you'll see that most of the time, they depict a sheep. Some of the time, when it looks cool, a goat is depicted. That is not ""wrong"" as a goat is a type of sheep (at least in Chinese), but if you just say 羊, what comes to most people's mind is a sheep and not a goat.   If I have to take a guess as to why most Chinese people think of a sheep and not a goat, I'd guess that it is probably because there is a sheep called 盘羊 that was native to China, or that when we're eating 羊肉 (sheep meat) we're more often eating sheep's meat and not goat's meat, or maybe just because 綿羊 are easier to find.   Edit: lol, I thought of a sorta funny story. When we first learned about goats, my teacher said mountain goats are sheep with beards. I'm not quite sure if that is true. In fact, I never quite understood what the difference between a goat and a sheep are, since some sheep look almost exactly like goats."
Awwducational,2wfsd2,Etonet,2,Fri Feb 20 07:15:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah by 羊 most people mean sheep, but what i meant was that it's not wrong to call a goat a 羊, or at least from my experience.    i don't agree with the zodiac/trinket thing.

Analysis of Plains groups' diets through the remains at middens and campsites point towards bison herds, like passenger pigeon flocks, being relatively in line with Old World fauna.  European diseases swept up from the Caribbean and Central America well before white people ever saw the Great Plains.  When smallpox, measles and influenza killed off the majority of indigenous humans, who were not only the apex predator on the continent, but also shaping the environment with fire and axe and agriculture, those prey species started to breed to enormous numbers.  For the most part, the ""forest primeval"" that European explorers and colonists talk about was a post-apocalyptic landscape, a creation of the European invasion itself."
Awwducational,2wdhj3,SupremeMugwump_ICoW,3,Thu Feb 19 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"It's more apt to compare bison to animals like wildebeest in Africa as  grassland expanses can support large herds of grazers.  While it's true that most American Indian tribes were decimated by Old World disease by the time of contact, I don't think it had much of an impact on bison populations.  Pre-contact tribes on the Great Plains practiced small-scale agriculture and only occasionally hunted bison; it was only after the introduction of the horse that bison hunting became a year-round activity for many (not all) Plains Tribes.  (See Reedstilt's comments in this thread for more about bison-use)"
Awwducational,2wdhj3,ginkomortus,1 point,Thu Feb 19 17:26:27 2015 UTC,"Dale Lott argues that the number of bison in North America in the late 15th century was between 24 and 27 million.  Furthermore, he argues that the vast grasslands of the Great Plains are basically the result of centuries of Indian ecological engineering, a fire-managed pasture for ""wild"" game.  Likewise, the buffalo that existed to the East Coast of the continent were introduced into burn-cleared areas and hunted by groups like the Haudenosaunee as what William Cronon called ""a foodstuff they had consciously been instrumental in creating.""  Numbers don't point towards American Indians being decimated by disease.

Awwducational,2w6om4,Slyndrr,5,Tue Feb 17 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"Why are some birds blue and some birds green?   Evolution works in millions of ways. It's not a calculated, guided process. If it works, or at least doesn't hurt survival, the trait can be kept.   Usually the showy one is the one that doesn't need to care for the offspring, showyness helps to attract mates. For a non-mammal species, it doesn't really matter much who that is.  Edit: please note that this is a very short and simplified explanation. Some harmful traits are kept, because the benefits outweigh the risks. Also, many non-mammals have one gender that has been specifically tailored to care for the offspring. Most don't care for it at all, and in those cases the males can also more be showy, because they can often have more partners and mate more times than the females in a mating cycle.  And then finally, there are mammals where the females are the showy ones despite the nursing, like hyenas."
Awwducational,2w6om4,potterarchy,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. It makes sense that it's random, being that some species have showy males, some females.

Awwducational,2w6om4,fildon,3,Tue Feb 17 17:50:31 2015 UTC,According to this the deeper reason is simply a matter of which gender 'invests' more into parenting.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_investment#Sexual_selection_and_parental_investment
Awwducational,2w6om4,PoliticalSponge,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:15:34 2015 UTC,Maybe the deeper reason has to do with the fact that each life has a unique experience and some species have showy females simply because it's different experience from belonging to a species with showy males. OC this extends to all the weird variations brought on by evolution and mutation.. which eventually brought about us..  Life must experience ALL THE THINGS!
Awwducational,2w6om4,varothen,2,Tue Feb 17 18:43:32 2015 UTC,"The sex that is not selective is the one that has to compete for the others interests. This is usually based on what sex puts more into parental care.  In this case the male is the selective one because he invests more into the offspring, so the females have to compete for male attention.   This kind of thing works both ways"
Awwducational,2w6om4,mcac,2,Tue Feb 17 18:22:22 2015 UTC,"People have already touched on this but the showy one is typically the sex that invests less, while the choosy one invests more. Typically females end up being the choosy one because they have a limited supply of eggs, or because they invest a lot of energy in producing eggs. Males usually have a near unlimited supply of sperm so they can afford to be a lot less cautious with it. Some antelopes have a sex role reversal where males invest a lot of energy in producing sperm and can't really mate more than once, so they end up being the choosy one while females fight for mates. There are other notable examples of this like phalaropes and seahorses.  These types of things also end up influencing behavior and caretaker roles... because females (usually) invest more in egg production etc, they are more likely to behave in a way that ensures their young grow up successfully so that their earlier efforts don't go to waste. Since males don't invest as much in sperm production and have a virtually unlimited supply of it, there isn't much reason to invest in caring for young and that time would be better spent mating with as many females as possible. Its kind of a quantity vs quality thing.  It gets more complicated than that, obviously, but those are kind of the basics"

Awwducational,2vzdk2,hippieofkindness,25,Sun Feb 15 19:12:51 2015 UTC,We don't really know the migration corridors or that would be a great solution. Some wind farms have experimented with turning off their turbines during the autumn migration and at night.

Organic free range farming of non-invasive species destroys more habitat than battery farming. Wind turbines kill bats, but are better than fossil fuels. Hydroelectric dams interrupt fish migration. Solar uses toxic substances, or so.   Everything we do has an impact on the environment. We just need to figure out which is least harmful."
Awwducational,2vzdk2,jesset77,5,Sun Feb 15 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"One interesting up and coming energy source is biofuel.  How it works is fast growing, carbon sucking plants, like poplars or giant grasses are being turned into biochar for use instead of fossilized carbons.  There's a coal plant in Oregon that is being retrofitted to burn this stuff,  I think it should be up and running in ≈5 years. This closes the carbon loop.  Plants pull carbon from the air, some of it gets fixed back into the soil, the rest gets released for energy production.  The important aspect is that atmospheric carbon is being used in this process unlike fossil fuels that release carbon that's been sequestered away for millions of years."
Awwducational,2vzdk2,uglyfatslug,5,Sun Feb 15 22:10:16 2015 UTC,"The thing with biofuels is if they're used enough, people are going to grow crops just to make biofuels, which ends up being waaaayyy worse than burning fossil fuels."
Awwducational,2vzdk2,sumfish,2,Mon Feb 16 01:37:42 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the crops.  Not all biofuels have the same energy outputs, nor do they need the same space or energy inputs as traditional crops.  And with the way things are going, no, I'm pretty sure it can't be any worse than burning fossil fuels. Anyway, at the current rate of consumption (mind you it's only increasing) the world is estimated to run out of coal in less than 200 years, natural gas in about 60 and oil in about 50 years."
Awwducational,2vzdk2,VoilaVoilaWashington,0,Mon Feb 16 02:09:29 2015 UTC,.. the world is estimated to run out of ..   Uhh... no. The world is estimated to reach a point where today's technology to extract the resource in question hits a wall due to extraction costs exceeding the value of resource extracted after X years.  These metrics always deeply underestimate because technological advances (like fracking.. yay?) continually get brought to bear in order to make the extraction cheaper and keep the supply chain running far longer than predicted.  Of course the fun side-game is that the environmental cost of these better extraction technologies grows exponentially as the more intense extraction techniques are invariably more disruptive to boot. Compare shaft mining to strip mining.
Awwducational,2vzdk2,Hara-Kiri,2,Mon Feb 16 13:42:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think is is a viable solution on its own. The energy put into farming the biofuel crops takes a huge bite out of the overall energy yield, if I recall correctly. Plus there's not enough farmland to grow both the amounts of biofuel required and necessary food crops."
Awwducational,2vzdk2,Hara-Kiri,2,Mon Feb 16 01:41:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think there will ever be a single, viable solution on its own, but it is another positive facet in conservation efforts.     From what I know, the biofuel crops actually don't take all that much energy to grow.  For instance, poplars, when cut, will sprout and regrow from left behind stumps and can grow 20 ft in just one growing season.  Plus, there's at least one strain that's been engineered to silence the release of VOCs, which is another huge win toward cleaner energy.     Another one of the potential biofuels is a giant grass called Arundo donax which can grow for 20-25 years without being replanted, you can harvest it twice in a growing season, and its energy yields are 15% higher than that of coal!"
Awwducational,2vzdk2,jesset77,3,Mon Feb 16 02:02:23 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but I think wind energy could do a bit better, especially if it is marketed as environmentally friendly. I'd like to see curtailment procedures mandated nationwide, but I don't foresee that happening as long as people aren't aware of the issue. These strategies can reduce fatalities by a significant margin with a small reduction in power generation. The past decade has been really hard on North American bats with over six million lost to white nose syndrome and something like 600,000 annually to wind farms."
Awwducational,2vzdk2,Hara-Kiri,3,Sun Feb 15 21:49:06 2015 UTC,"You cited a 5% loss of power somewhere else. That's HUGE in the industry, where a 1% gain is touted as a breakthrough.

I see the issue as being somewhat similar to hydropower and salmon. I'm glad the wind energy community is trying to get out in front of this issue before more bat species need to be declared endangered, which complicates everything legally. There's also some really cool bladeless wind farm designs that I hope get investigated. They also look a lot more aesthetically pleasing to me than the big oscillating fan design. I think we could also place them (in addition to solar panels) in some urban areas where their impact on wildlife might be less.

Also we wouldn't have to 'pretend' safety isn't a concern, it basically isn't. With current safety measures accidents like Chernobyl are practically an impossibility.

Sometimes, these plants can be harmful to the cat; however, assuming that you do not keep poisonous plants in your home where your cat can have access, the main problem is what cats can do to the plant.

Also, on the topic of mating pairs, the geese that do pair for life will do so, but that's not to say nature is full of widows.  If you get a true pair and the male dies, the female will usually re-pair, and the male will almost always try to.  So it is for ""life"" of one of them.  There's also a ""divorce"" rate in geese due to infertility. A new pair that doesn't produce offspring will likely go their separate ways.  Finally, the romantic idea of a true pair is mainly just an idea in nature, and certainly so in ducks.  Ducks are actually very rapey."

In a swampy area where there aren't too many food crops and where these little guys are a major source of nutrients, not being able to eat them wouldn't fulfill that purpose.  Of course now, eating capybera is no longer a subsistence thing.  Then again, eating meat is no longer a luxury, and very few Catholics feel like they're punishing themselves for their sins by having neighborhood fish fries on Fridays during Lent.  It's probably a matter of identity now."

Awwducational,2vnrqw,Athilda,2,Fri Feb 13 04:02:13 2015 UTC,"There is a Legend of the Capybara in Santa Barbara.  I am, probably, the only person who has called it that to this date, but I bet that changes. I hope I can do the story justice.  In Santa Barbara, there is a beautiful little zoo with many well-tended animals of all types.  Beneath and between the zoo and the ocean is a beautiful park known as the Andre Clark Bird Refuge.  The Santa Barbara Zoo had several capybaras, and like many other rodents, they are skilled at digging.  One day, a capybara managed to escape his enclosure and wandered on down to the bird refuge.  At the Andre Clark Bird Refuge, there is a beautiful pond, and there are jogging and biking paths all around.  Several people reported to animal control that they saw the world's biggest rat and omg DO SOMETHING.  Fortunately, the zoo managed to cooperate with the animal control people, and convinced them (the city animal control) that darting the beast was bad as it would flee to the water and probably drown.  So, they decided to trap it.  As luck would have it, the capybara in question loved bananas, so they filled a trap with bananas and sure enough, the capy was soon on his way back up the hill to his pen at the zoo.  Evidently, the keepers didn't realize exactly how much this particular capy enjoyed his vacation away from the zoo for he soon escaped again!   So, of course, they set out a trap again, but it seems, this capy was a quick learner!  The second time it took many days to catch him again.  He did so well on his vacation from the zoo that he gained about a full pound for every day he was in the bird refuge!  Well, they did finally catch him and instead of worrying about him escaping again, they sent him off to a zoo in San Francisco!"

Awwducational,2vjep0,Methers,12,Wed Feb 11 15:22:07 2015 UTC,"so by what I read from OP's Source, it seems that the birds reduce the amount of heat lost by having their legs and feet simply operating at a much lower temperature than their core, thanks to their arteries/veins acting as a counter current heat exchanger. Lower temperature differences mean less heat loss, which relates to the ability to keep the core body temperature high with less effort.  Interesting!"
Awwducational,2vjep0,LicianDragon,7,Wed Feb 11 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"Right, and the vein and artery are close to each so that warm blood flowing to the extremities downwards warms the cold blood circulating upwards.

Awwducational,2verp1,silentbeater1,2,Tue Feb 10 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"It's actually a pretty significant difference too.  For instance, you can actually eat many venoms safely (as long as you don't have ulcers in your stomach to let it get in your blood) because they're only dangerous in your blood stream.  There are many instances of people drinking snake venom, for example, with no ill effects at all.  Now, that doesn't mean no venoms are poisonous, but there is a significant distinction."

Awwducational,2v76tq,dumb_step,2,Sun Feb 8 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah in the Huachucas. I don't think they go after healthy adult humans too often, but that doesn't really make you feel better when you know you're being followed. It was my first sighting, so I guess that part was kind of cool."
Awwducational,2v76tq,CustosClavium,6,Sun Feb 8 22:06:18 2015 UTC,"When did you first realize it? I live in Tucson and frequently go off the beaten path with my dad down in the Arivaca area where the ghost towns are, as well as the remote areas down in Cochise. I'm pretty oblivious to things but I am great at spotting deer. Bad news is mountain lions probably are too...and see me seeing them."
Awwducational,2v76tq,dumb_step,9,Sun Feb 8 22:31:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't see it the first time. I passed a hiker who then went around a switchback, and not even a minute later, he came running back to tell me that there was a lion stalking down the trail behind me just around the bend. It ran uphill when he startled it.  I caught a glimpse of it a few hours later behind me, off the trail uphill. It looked full grown, but maybe it was still an inexperienced juvenile to be sighted like that? I think maybe it was just curious, too, or wanted to nab pack and the summer sausage inside."

Awwducational,2v3iz9,vanillamasala,6,Sat Feb 7 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"What does this have to do with pangolins, exactly? If it is Asian markets importing them for use in their medicines then it is not a stereotype to say that they are doing it.  It's great that you want to talk about cultural hypocrisy, but getting irate about someone saying ""traditional"" (<---not actually traditional) Asian medicine is to blame for the endangerment of pangolins is weird,  because that IS the #1 cause of it.. so why are you getting mad that they said so?"

Bats live almost everywhere except the poles, so there may be a location in your neighborhood where you can find them. A pond in the summer with a strong flashlight at dusk is a great place to check.  There are a few rehab facilities that accept volunteers. I unfortunately can't recall all of them, but I know of places in California, Michigan and Florida. Unfortunately, it may be very difficult to get to touch a bat as they can be disease vectors like all wild animals. Many places require you to have the rabies pre-exposure vaccine before volunteering.  There are also some live bat cams at Bat World Sanctuary, Woodland Park Zoo, Florida Museum of Natural History and The Bat Zone (aka Organization for Bat Conservation). There used to be one at Bracken Cave, but it is down.  Of the bats I've been able to touch, I can tell you their fur is soft like a rabbit's and their wings feel somewhat like the skin of your eyelids. Its so thin and stretchy that you can hardly feel it."

But with east-west, you could shift the dividing line back and forth without making much of a difference. I'd guess that the reasons why the right and left sides of this map, for example, aren't the east and west hemispheres are more or less arbitrary and stem from historical contingencies."
Awwducational,2usk0p,Bulwarky,1 point,Thu Feb 5 00:24:50 2015 UTC,"The North and South hemispheres make sense because it correlates to things in nature. For example, the seasons are opposite in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. It also correlates with the North and South poles, which are very real things. The further you go North of the Equator, it will generally get colder, and the further you go South of it it will generally get colder, because the sun hits the Earth at a less direct angle.  On the other hand, there is no East or West pole that the Eastern and Western hemispheres are correlated with.

Edit: I googled it. And I ended up falling down an extremely long internet rabbit hole in which I learned all about monotremes and how they lactate (they don't have nipples, they just have glands that secrete milk onto their bellies and the babies lap it up). I ended up reading a really interesting paper about why exactly Carl Linneaus decided to name the mammal class after the females' ability to lactate, and how that decision was influenced by other aspects of the culture at the time. And of course that meant I had to look up pretty much everything that was referenced on Wikipedia. Did you know that Jean-Jacques Rousseau placed all five of his children in foundling homes, despite writing extensively on the proper way to raise children and being very outspoken in his belief that women should nurse their own children (as opposed to using wet nurses)? What a hypocrite! He didn't even bother to write down their genders or birthdays before he shipped them off to the orphanage!  Edit again: Wow, gold?

Awwducational,2uixmm,Ells86,5,Tue Feb 3 16:00:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah it has been a lifelong problem for me. I finally got treatment for it in my senior year of college. I wish I hadn't waited so long. But it was a long time before any psychiatrist recognized the problem. ADHD is really under-diagnosed in women and girls. When I was a kid, most of the existing research on it had been done on young boys. But since girls are socialized differently, ADHD manifests itself differently in them. So my teachers and parents never saw my behavior as ADHD symptoms, and I ended up getting treatment for all kinds of crap that was NOT the problem. I was even treated for bipolar disorder once (something that is very much OVER diagnosed in women), which was disastrous. But I did finally find a doctor who had the answer, and things have been much better for me."
Awwducational,2uixmm,danaofdoom,3,Tue Feb 3 16:08:39 2015 UTC,"Sounds similar to my situation. I started self-medicating for ADHD my  last year of undergrad. Once I got to grad school, I realized it was a necessity and saw a doc. It took months of tests, interviews, appointments, etc...but I finally got a script.  I'm off of it now...partially because I've moved and found it difficult to find a doc willing to treat adult ADHD....and partially because it ritalin taught me enough coping strategies to focus on my own.  I've actually been told that ""ADHD is a learning disability, you can't both have a PhD and have a learning disability.""  I'm still trying to decide whether to go back on it. It's...easy to abuse so I'm a bit wary. I often found myself running out a few days before the refill and having to fight withdrawals.

Awwducational,2uixmm,Ells86,3,Tue Feb 3 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"""ADHD is a learning disability, you can't both have a PhD and have a learning disability.""   Wow, that is ridiculous. Yeah, it's kind of a learning disability. But so is dyslexia. So is depression, in a way, but there have definitely been enough depressed PhD's out there...  And anyway, schools are required to accommodate students with learning disabilities. My school let me take tests in a separate room because being with other students was distracting. If it weren't possible to obtain a degree with a learning disability, why would disabled people be admitted in the first place?   It's...easy to abuse so I'm a bit wary. I often found myself running out a few days before the refill and having to fight withdrawals.    Maybe you aren't on the right dosage? I'm on Vyvanse, and I find it difficult to abuse. Taking more Vyvanse won't give you a stronger reaction, since it's a controlled release. It will just make the effects last longer. If I were to take too much, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.   But then again, I haven't really had a lot of issues with addiction in the past. I was able to successfully quit smoking, I've never become dependent on alcohol or anything like that. The only thing I really have trouble with is caffeine, but a big part of that is that I don't see a real reason to kick that dependency. So if you find you are prone to abusing your medication, you're probably making the responsible decision."
Awwducational,2uixmm,danaofdoom,3,Tue Feb 3 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"I've been very interested in Vyvanse, actually. I had a friend on it and he let me try a couple out and they were much better than methylphenidate. I noticed an overwhelming calm that allowed me to focus.  The problem with methylphenidate is that its constantly staving off a crash.  You take the dose...and a few hours later you feel like crap. In fact, I often noticed my feeling poor prior to loss of focus.  I am certainly prone to abusing medications, not in an over-the-top way but just enough to always be a problem at the end of the month.  I often struggle with the question of performance enhancement. I know that I can function and be a productive scientist without it...but I also know that I can give it another 20% effort if I have it. To me, that's no different than taking steroids."

Platypi actually give each other names, though because they're not very imaginative they're all named Dave.

Awwducational,2uixmm,Myschly,6,Tue Feb 3 15:23:00 2015 UTC,So basically they're a transition between birds and mammals?
Awwducational,2uixmm,Hosni__Mubarak,17,Mon Feb 2 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"Well their sex chromosome architecture is similar to birds than other mammals. As a human you have two sex chromosomes, XY or XX (male or female). Platypus has ten XYXYXYXYXY or XXXXXXXXXX. This is similar (but not exactly the same) to the way birds arrange their sex chromosomes. Analysis of the platypus X chromosome shows a lot of similarity (sequence alignment and orthologs to use the fancy terms) with chickens and none with humans.   So the common ancestor between birds and platypus may very well have been a transition between bird-like reptiles and mammals, but in the platypus themselves we're seeing the genetic shadow cast by that ancestor, so to speak. However, this could also be an example of convergent evolution where a similar trait evolved independently: birds and platypus got the same answer without working together).   Here is a nice easily consumable write up of the platypus genome study   Going down the rabbit hole of how genomes function: Let's say you're a female (XX). The X chromosome (like all chromosomes) encodes for proteins and other various bits of molecular awesomeness like miRNA. If you're female, you would produce twice as much of these proteins because you have two copies of the DNA template to make them. That would be bad, it would throw all sorts of cellular mechanisms out of whack, so early on when just an embryo one of the X chromosomes is inactivated. Platypus must have a different mechanism to regulate the expression of proteins from their sex chromosomes because even if X-inactivation occurs that still leaves 5 functional X chromosomes.   Sorry for the text wall! If you made it through that paragraph of genetic weirdness here's a little fun fact: you can see X chromosome inactivation for yourself in tortoise shell and calico cats as the fur color gene is on the X-chromosome. Some X's carry the orange gene and others carry not orange and the chromosomes carrying those genes are inactivated randomly resulting in a pretty kitty.  (source: X-inactivation) -this is a great paper if you can get through the paywall!  (source: bird sex chromosomes)"

Awwducational,2u77vl,Throwaway_Luck,11,Fri Jan 30 19:15:11 2015 UTC,"Money quotes from wikipedia:   Female harpy eagles typically weigh 6 to 9 kg (13 to 20 lb).[9][11] One source states that adult females can weigh up to 10 kg (22 lb).[12] An exceptionally large captive female, ""Jezebel"", weighed 12.3 kg (27 lb).[13] Being captive, this large female may not be representative of the weight possible in wild harpy eagles due to differences in the food availability.[14][15] The male, in comparison, is much smaller and weighs only about 4 to 4.8 kg (8.8 to 10.6 lb).[9][11] Harpy eagles are 86.5–107 cm (2 ft 10 in–3 ft 6 in) long[10][11] and have a wingspan of 176 to 224 cm (5 ft 9 in to 7 ft 4 in).[9][10] Among the standard measurements, the wing chord measures 54–63 cm (1 ft 9 in–2 ft 1 in), the tail measures 37–42 cm (1 ft 3 in–1 ft 5 in), the tarsus is 11.4–13 cm (4.5–5.1 in) long and the exposed culmen from the cere is 4.2 to 6.5 cm (1.7 to 2.6 in).[9][16][17]  The harpy eagle routinely takes prey weighing more than 7 kg (15 lb).[9] The harpy eagle possess the largest talons of any living eagle. The harpy's feet are extremely powerful and can exert a pressure of 42 kgf/cm² (4.1 MPa or 530 lbf/in2 or 400 N/cm2) with its talons.[37] The harpy eagle has been recorded as lifting prey up to equal their own body weight.[9] That allows the bird to snatch a live sloth from tree branches, as well as other huge prey items. Males usually take relatively smaller prey, with a typical range of 0.5 to 2.5 kg (1.1 to 5.5 lb) or about half their own weight.[9] The larger females take larger prey, with a minimum recorded prey weight of around 2.7 kg (6.0 lb). Adult female harpys regularly grab large male howler or spider monkeys or mature sloths weighing 6 to 9 kg (13 to 20 lb) in flight and fly off without landing, an enormous feat of strength.[9][33][38] Prey items taken to the nest by the parents are normally medium-sized, having been recorded from 1 to 4 kg (2.2 to 8.8 lb).[9] The prey brought to the nest by males averaged 1.5 kg (3.3 lb), while the prey brought to the nest by females averaged 3.2 kg (7.1 lb).[20]"

Just had the unfortunate luck that they lived in my house for years (and possibly some still do). They're much cooler to watch outside than when they're inside. Though I've gotten better about it after not living here (and getting to relax about them) for a few years before moving back in.  As a bonus I now know that rabies injections are hot pink, and it's a small amount (though the start with 4 needles at once was rough) of intramuscular injections compared to the numerous stomach injections of the past.  So what makes one a bat specialist? :)"
Awwducational,2u3byi,kudakitsune,6,Thu Jan 29 18:30:53 2015 UTC,"The moderators gave me that flair. I prefer expert, because people like /u/mkjcaylor are actual professionals. I just post stuff on here, /r/batty, and /r/batfacts to hopefully dispel some of the negative stigma surrounding really interesting and mostly beneficial creatures.  I got my rabies pre-exposure in 3 shots over a period of a few months, as I recall. I don't remember the color, but I don't like to watch the needle going in. I recently had my blood drawn to check how my antibodies are doing. This is a requisite to work with bats, which I've done in the past.   These two sites are the ones I commonly refer people to when they encounter bats in living spaces. Usually the bats are just as frightened as the humans."
Awwducational,2u3byi,Anaseb,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"Yea we've tried a lot of the standard methods of keeping them out. Just takes time to find all those spots even if you make a point of watching where they come out every night. Ended up learning a fair bit about them due to living with them.  It was a bit harder for me to remain calm after 10 years of waking up to bats in my room or having them appear while I'm elsewhere in the house. Took me a few months after moving to not get startled by shadows in the dark (which was often the first moment you realized something was up) and be able to just go to sleep.  Had another last year (moved back in with my mom while I'm went to college) but it was easier for me to keep calm, possibly because I know the shots aren't as scary now as everyone liked to tell me when I was younger. You can definitely tell how scared they are feeling trapped and not knowing where they need to go to get out. They tend to circle around a few times before moving to the next area and doing the same there. Most times I just open the doors and let them try and fly out on their own.  My shots were post exposure, so I think it's also a little different. Got hit in the head by one (who was also crawling on the ground at one point, making me uneasy about it's condition) trying to make my escape from the basement. Opened the doors and he almost hit me again even though I was standing outside. Most other times they've been much more precise, even if it doesn't seem that way at first (due to your own panic), after awhile you can tell they're really trying not to hit you.  Post exposure shots have a large ""loading dose"" based on your body weight. So I got four injections in the ER, only three nurses able to assist so it was 3 at once and then the fourth after one was done with the other shot. One in each shoulder and one in each thigh. If I had been heavier they would've flipped me over and poked me in the butt too. Then it's just a shot every few weeks for a little while, similar to the kind of schedule you had.  So what do you do with bats that required your shots? Sounds like you're at least a bit of a professional if you're working with them, especially compared to the average person.  Nice to talk with someone who doesn't act like they're winged demons flying straight out of hell. I try my best to calm that fear when I can, and to tell people that rabies shots aren't as scary as they used to be. Seems that is a large factor in many people's fear of various wild animals, they just don't want to have all those crazy stomach injections, which is fair. Telling them how it's done now tends to be a relief for them to hear.  I didn't mean to write you a novel! I swear >_>  Thanks for the sub links, I'll have to check them out! Bats are actually pretty cool to me. And I do generally care for the well being of most animals, so they're no exception :)"
Awwducational,2u3byi,BackAlleyRockstar,3,Thu Jan 29 19:21:34 2015 UTC,"Rabies has an almost 100% fatality rate. Something like less than 20 people in all of history have survived. Rabid is a good book if you're interested in pathology and medical history. So getting the shots was definitely the right call, especially if a bat was having a hard time flying. Bats get a bad rap for rabies in part because they are much more likely to encounter humans when they are sick. The actual infection rate for bats (estimated to be less than 1%) is lower than for many other animals and worldwide dogs are the most common carriers. Fortunately, we've had a pretty good vaccination campaign for canines in the US.  I don't work with bats currently beyond volunteering at my local zoo right now, but in the past I've worked on wind turbine studies and other surveys.  Have you guys tried putting up bat houses? It might help get them out of the house. Here's a list of vendors which sell bat houses which have been shown to work"

Awwducational,2u3byi,gnarlystar,3,Thu Jan 29 18:53:54 2015 UTC,"RES stands for Reddit Enhancement Suite.  t does a lot of things actually! But the feature I mentioned just keep track of users I've upvoted. Each first appearing as a [+1] after the users name. In the case of /u/remotectrl it tells me I've now upvoted them 6 times. It's handy since I don't always remember user names even if I've enjoyed their posts, so after a few times you realize that some of the posts you like are actually from the same person.  It also has a ""tag"" feature. You can choose a colour for the text box and then type in whatever description you like. I use it on some of my hobby subreddits for game developers, people who consistently post high quality material, and those with great knowledge of a particular subject. One example being from someone who's active in /r/Archery but is also a bowyer. Since he makes bows he has a large knowledge base about certain aspects of bow design and construction. So the tag reminds me of that whenever I see his posts (and also because I want to buy one of his bows one day, they're gorgeous).  There's a lot more features than just those two, but it's basically something that adds a lot of customizable stuff like that to enhance the overall experience. I've really enjoyed it so far :)"
Awwducational,2u3byi,Oreosmooshy,2,Thu Jan 29 19:33:10 2015 UTC,It's Reddit Enhancement Suite. It's an add-on for Chrome or Firefox that adds a bunch of features to reddit like the ability to tag individual users (like flair but for the whole site so you can remember individual users easily) and it shows you how much you've upvoted or downvoted people as well as a few quality of life improvements to the comment box (like a larger editor and previews)  There are links to download it on the sidebar of this official subreddit: /r/Enhancement

Awwducational,2u3d3k,exxocet,22,Thu Jan 29 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"So the idea is that the chicks increase their chances of survival by mimicking a large toxic flannel moth  caterpillar that occurs in the same area , making themselves look less attractive to potential predators.   If this turns out to be true then this is called batesian mimicry,  because the chick isn't actually toxic or poisonous but only acting like it.   You can read all about it here, pity it is paywalled.  But those familiar with birds may know that there are actually some birds that are poisonous themselves!  The New Guinean Blue-capped ifrit, Pitohuis and the Little shrikethrush. They seem to utilise the neurotoxins known as batrachotoxins more famous for being the poison of the poison-dart frogs and probably also get the toxins from the beetles they eat.  In some places in Africa the Spurwing Goose also becomes poisonous after eating some beetles with the  grass (and check out the fighting bone projections on the wings! Spurs!). Other birds may get their toxins from plants such as some Quail, this may have been alluded to in the bible, Aristotle even may have mentioned something about it. The bones of the Australian Bronzewing pigeon may also be  toxic thanks to the seeds that they eat.  Anyway I forgot what I was talking about, I can't remember if I had a point or if I just got side-tracked.  But, ah, there you have it."

Awwducational,2u3d3k,DodgyBollocks,3,Thu Jan 29 22:35:42 2015 UTC,"As a fan of caterpillars, I'm curious what about them bothers you - do you only hate the fuzzy ones, dislike the way they move, etc?  Fun fact: caterpillars, as you know, are the baby form of butterflies and moths. Butterflies are true insects (six legs, three body segments, two sets of wings when adult), so... so are caterpillars. As such, caterpillars have only three sets of legs! The extra leg looking things towards the back are called prolegs; they are just body lumps that they can use to help move themselves. :)"

Awwducational,2tbtww,IMBAtvTorai,5,Thu Jan 22 21:02:31 2015 UTC,It's also the national bird of Denmark
Awwducational,2tbtww,QuackingMonkey,1 point,Fri Jan 23 04:54:44 2015 UTC,"European here. Really? The only time I see mutes behave aggressive towards other birds (or any creature) is if they come within around 20-40m of their nest. Approaching their young seems to be a risk depending on what couple it is. Outside of their breeding season, I see them swim side by side with other waterfowl without issues.  Is the American swan population more aggressive? Are the native American waterfowl more annoying? Is it because all the swans who I encounter, live in densely populated areas? I find this honestly odd to hear."
Awwducational,2tbtww,QuackingMonkey,2,Fri Jan 23 15:17:23 2015 UTC,"I believe here in the northeast U.S. the Mute swans are in competition with our other invasive waterfowl, the Canada Goose. I've seen some scuffles between them. Generally though it is during the breeding season when territories are established or young are about. I haven't seen them chase or harass native waterfowl such as ducks, herons or egrets but it may depend on the habitat.  I wouldn't say they (at least what I've seen which is a small subset of a much larger northeastern population) are hyper aggressive."

Anyhow, let's lighten the chat with another swan mating funfact, or at least something that I heard about.

Which expand and contract to give off color. Generally speaking when they expand it shows excitement and thus brighter colours such as reds and oranges. while when they contract it is deeper cooler colors such as the blues and purples. Most people think they change color to blend in which is un true. they change color to display their mood and often the climate. Green is the ""base: color for most chameleons however when you begin to look at chameleons that live mostly om the ground rather than trees yoy begin to see a lot of brown as the ""base"" most members of the Brookesia family are brownish.   As for temperament it can really be a crap shoot.

We have the passport law in Britain because it's an EU regulation, and there's always the chance that a horse from Britain can end up being slaughtered in another country."
Awwducational,2t4kcz,CaptnCheerio,2,Wed Jan 21 14:39:42 2015 UTC,"You never know where a horse might end up. A beloved child's pony can very easily end up in a feed lot due to an injury and the wrong owner.   Pretty much everything used on horses in the US has a label on it that says ""Do not use in animals intended for humans consumption."" Including a pain killer called bute, which is like advil for horses  (originally developed for humans with arthritis but had nasty side effects) and wormer which we give to horses every couple months.  Horses have passports to keep up with what horses are unfit for consumption.  Edit: Some draft horses are bred for meat, but they are raised like cattle rather than pets."

(minor concern but some people are weird about that) * mislabelling of food; if it's beef lasagne it should be beef in there. * safety of the meat being used; since there was no regulation regarding the consumption of horses, nobody knew what kind of drugs/chemicals/diseases were in the meat and what the effects of that would be on human consumers.  in response, the passports are introduced to make sure that the wrong animals don't end up in the food chain. It also makes it more difficult for a would-be thief to take your horse."

Awwducational,2t1hq1,Psychobiologist,11,Tue Jan 20 14:00:25 2015 UTC,Kittens may be a fun name used by people who like rats (myself among those) but it's definitely not the proper terminology. Pups is the actual name and you're spot on about the milk band.
Awwducational,2t1hq1,Ratlet,5,Tue Jan 20 23:10:44 2015 UTC,"That's odd, as I've never heard anyone refer to them as pups in both recreational and professional settings (lab work!).

Awwducational,2t1hq1,Psychobiologist,6,Tue Jan 20 23:54:26 2015 UTC,Yup. I work with them daily and used to have them as pets. In all cases here they're pups. I work with lots of international scientists who refer to them as pups as well. I'm guessing kittens is the recreational term elsewhere?
Awwducational,2t1hq1,Ratlet,2,Wed Jan 21 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"Well weirdly enough we use the term kittens here quite often professionally here too, I'm also in the science biz.

I wish I could recall where I read it to assure it's true, but what I remember is that female octopodes lay hundreds of thousands of eggs and starve to death protecting them (the males die a few months later as well), only for the vast majority of the larvae/zooplankton to die themselves...leaving only two of the offspring to live for only up to half a decade. Seriously, 2 is the number I remember! Doesn't seem so sustainable--and makes those rat and kangaroo preemies look like precocious foals by comparison.

Awwducational,2t23fd,Providang,2,Tue Jan 20 15:36:17 2015 UTC,"Reclassifications (and associated new species) are getting fairly common with bats as we have much better genetic and acoustic detection techniques.  One of the best examples of this was the separation of the common pipistrelle and the soprano pipistrelle which ""sing"" at different frequencies. In the hand they can be almost impossible to tell apart.   This confirmed the suspicion that the two forms were cryptic species. Interestingly they were genetically much more different than was initially suspected, and had probably separated as distinct species between 5 – 10 million years ago. This made them much less closely related than species such as brown and grey long-eared bats, or whiskered and Brandt’s bat. Further DNA analysis of the pipistrelle type specimen showed it to be one of the 45 kHz types. This has retained the scientific name Pipistrellus pipistrellus, and is known as the common pipistrelle. The 55 kHz form has been given the name Pipistrellus pygmaeus, and as its echolocation call has a higher frequency, is known as the soprano pipistrelle.  Unfortunately for those of us who work in the field, although statistically there are clear differences between many aspects of the two species, there is a great deal of overlap between them. Morphologically there is no single feature in their dentition or biometric measurements that can be used to separate them. In some individuals, there is also an overlap in the peak frequencies of their  echolocation calls. On top of this there is a suggestion that the overall appearance of the two species may vary geographically (as it does in whiskered and Brandt’s bat) making them easier to separate in some areas of the country than others.    There's a few interesting comments from when this discovery was shared here a few months ago."

An owl will do that when they're feeling threatened and think they have a good chance of defending themselves. The poofy feathers and outstretched wings make the owl look a lot bigger and scarier than it actually is. The little compressed twig-shaped pose is a type of camouflage. A lot of owls' plumage patterns look a lot like tree bark, and when they compress all their feathers it's difficult to tell the owl apart from a twig or a branch. That pose is ""don't eat me, I'm not even here, nope, no owls here, move right along oh god please don't eat me."" Small owl species can be prey for larger owl species, so they're always aware of potential danger."

Awwducational,2sqp66,rutabega234,17,Sat Jan 17 19:36:56 2015 UTC,"Yep! Fun fact: those little feather tufts some owls have are part of the same camouflaging behavior. The tufts look sort of like jagged edges of a broken branch, making the owl look even less like a tasty snack.  On the other hand, the tufts are also used for communication. Tufts all the way up is an alert signal (aahh! a predator!) and tufts pressed back against the head is ""do not f-ck with me; I am not in the mood for your shenanigans"" (I don't usually censor profanity but I don't remember this sub's policy on it). In the wild owls might use that to communicate with their mate, but otherwise they tend to be solitary-minded so I'm not sure exactly how or why that behavior evolved.  The tufts have a name, and it's my favorite word ever: plumicorns! Literally translates to ""feather-horns,"" which I suppose is pretty accurate. :D"
