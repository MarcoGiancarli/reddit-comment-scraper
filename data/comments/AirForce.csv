This right here, is why we need legalized marijuana for Airmen.  Alcohol is so deeply embedded in Air Force culture; a situation which is propagated by the institution itself.  What do you see at a promotion party?  A keg of beer?  What about the Christmas Party, Dining In's/Out's, the Air Force Ball?  The liquor flows freely.  As a young junior enlisted Airman, not drinking at all is taboo, and will alienate you and leave you feeling isolated and excluded.  Everything I just described is even worse overseas, especially in places like Japan, Korea, Germany--all there is to do for our young Airmen is a hard night on the town drinking, and they often go overboard and get straight up belligerent.  Many a drunk night at dorm parties, if you aren't drinking you aren't having ""fun.""  Alcohol culture leads to rape culture, DUI's, and all sorts of other badness.  Marijuana is a safer, healthier alternative.  It's time the military gave service-members a safer, more healthy alternative to alcohol as our ""intoxicant of choice.""

There are some really good leadership books to read that could help out; e.g. Anything John C. Maxwell.  Lean forward in your work.  That's to say if your boss asks you to do something by COB 30 days from now don't start working on it the morning of the 30th day.

It will transform your mindset.  Outside of mental state, do what others have said here and that is to try expanding your horizons. Try helping other people with their own projects at work or after-work. Learn other peoples jobs as much as you can.

AirForce,3e0mui,Aurailious,5,Tue Jul 21 13:12:36 2015 UTC,"Do note, suicide isn't a firearm problem it's a mental health problem. Lumping it in as a firearm problem is a great disservice to the actual underlying problems that need to be addressed (lack of proper mental health care, care coverage, cultural views on mental health, etc).  We, as a nation and culture, have some deep and real problems. And firearms, in spite of the shock associated with occasional multiple shootings and such, are not one of those problems. They are merely tools that end up associated with the results of those deeper problems (violence fetish [death and assault is OK on TV, show a nipple and everyone loses their mind], misogyny, misandry, mental health stigmas, etc)."

AirForce,3e0mui,snowseth,5,Tue Jul 21 15:58:10 2015 UTC,"None of that matters.   It absolutely matters.  You can't save a person when their brain is on the wall and such a decision can happen in seconds.  People can survive from other methods, or other methods are much more difficult and can stop a person from going all the way.  Its going to be decades before mental health is treated enough where the tool doesn't matter.  But the fact of the matter is that firearms dramatically increase the chances of a successful suicide.  You don't know the thought process behind suicide, it isn't absolute that the person commits fully to.    There is a massive difference between being a finger pull away and jumping off a bridge.  Going to a bridge and jumping off takes time, time enough for many to reconsider.  For some to be pulled off it.  Many other methods are the same.  Decreasing access to firearms decreases suicide rates.  I think the point we can both agree on is that it doesn't decrease the rate of attempt, just that many more are successful with a more lethal option readily available.

Existing laws would not go away.   That said, when you're off base there are conceal carriers everywhere in stores, gas stations, movie theaters, etc. All of which may have not needed to complete basic safety courses.  I don't see any difference between conceal carry on base and off base if such laws were created.    When some states were getting conceal carry for the first time people were so afraid that CCW would create unsafe situations. It was only the lack of understanding of opponents that lead to this fear. Today, we know that conceal carry has saved lives (Including my own) and may be responsible for drops in crime."
AirForce,3e0mui,HowDoYouUpvote,7,Tue Jul 21 03:54:59 2015 UTC,Not saying I want people in the dorms to have guns but how can you not also advocate for them? Do they not have the right to defend themselves but everyone else does? That doesn't make much sense to me.

You to want to be able to defend yourselves for the 8-12 hours on base while people in the dorms who spend almost all their time on base cant?

I think a lot of people are standoffish at the idea of conceal carry on base because they misunderstand it. It's not like the military is going to arm everyone on base and guns are just going to be flying everywhere. In reality, I think that most of us supporters just want the people who already conceal carry off base be allowed the same rights on, with a few stipulations.  When I live in base housing in the states I was allowed to keep guns in my home. There were a couple extra steps, but it was completely doable. All I had to do was file a couple forms with the armory that I had reviewed/signed with my first sergeant. I would like to see that same process apply to those who wish to conceal carry on base. Be conceal/carry qualified in the state of your base, register your conceal firearms with the armory before the first time you carry, and get signed off by the shirt.   Does that mean everyone is going to have a gun? No. It means those of us who wish to conceal carry and have obtained the proper certifications can do so by simple registration and approval.   Sidenote - This is still conceal/carry. Brandishing a concealed firearm should be cause for either temporary or permanent suspension of conceal privileges on a case-by-case basis."
AirForce,3e0mui,BraveLilToasty,3,Tue Jul 21 05:12:03 2015 UTC,Probably the most level headed approach yet. Look nothing changes except you can now carry past the gate. If some scrub is acting like an idiot with a gun call the cops. File a report or something.

Without a doubt I think members who carry retired military ID's should also be able to conceal/carry on base. In the event of a member being retired, they could check a block on the form filed with armory reflecting their retired status and forgo the first sergeant signature. This also would be just the first time they carry on base. A mild inconvenience compared to not carrying on base at all, in my opinion. The other requirements would stay the same.  What are your thoughts?"

My personal sidearm doesn't even have a a traditional safety. It's much like a Glock with a trigger safety. From an actual defense standpoint this makes the most sense.

To all the people afraid of accidents this implements 4 intentional steps before a round can be fired.  I do agree with a round in the chamber with safety (if one is present).

(This would be the majority, I'm not grouping the 26-28 year olds in the ""young"" group, it's just an overall view)  NCOs should be in a position to accept the responsibility of possessing a firearm.  If they do not want to carry that is up to them, if they do request to carry, they still have to be cleared by the commander.

But you have to factor in the AF big wigs. They would over complicate everything with AFIs. Local commanders would further complicate with OIs (remember they can be even more stringent). The rules would inevitably be backwards and we'd write ourselves into corners. It's the AF way!  Has empirical evidence of active shooters/terrorist attacks on U.S. bases in America proven that the risk/reward is worth it? Would more guns on base mean a safer environment or an increase in active shooters/accidental discharges/threats towards protection level resources?...so on so forth. Those are the things that would be debated. I don't have enough information to make that assessment but the guys up top do...or at least they have the money to get a study."
AirForce,3e0mui,BasrieI,3,Tue Jul 21 18:22:24 2015 UTC,"Where would one even conceal a sidearm in ABUs? Genuinely curious  I support open carry on base by active, on-duty personnel. I think displaying ""I'm here, I'm geared"" will help with prevention of active shooters, which is good. I also think if we're going to do this, we should do it the Air Force way.   Commanders will create and maintain an arming roster of those individuals in his/her unit that have been certified by CATM on the M9 Beretta and Use of Force by local Security Forces S3T. These individuals should be removed from the roster as appropriate. Individuals that wish to arm for duty will show up at the SF armory one hour prior to shift start and be issued via AF 1297 an M9 Beretta and 15 rounds of 9mm ammunition. The weapon will be turned in immediately after shift.   Some considerations: -This weapon is AF property and must remain on base. That means no off base lunch for those who wish to arm.  -In places where SF manning is low, there may not always be an armorer posted all the time, and may be unable to immediately respond to issue weapons to base populace. Maybe say that general arming must be done during a certain time frame every morning?   -Individual commanders hold the final word on where weapons can go in their respective units  -Refer to AFI 31-117 in all questionable situations  -AirMan will be issued a M249 to carry as long as he remains in the AF.  -Personally owned weapons can stay in your vehicle as long as the magazine is removed and it is secured by two layers of protection (locked car door/weapon case or weapon case/chamber lock)  I think this will allow people to carry on base to increase safety, but will make it inconvenient for those that just want to be tacticool."

I mean, that's what Security Forces and FPCONs are for right? And maybe my logic is too simplistic in that more guns = more chances for accidents/shootings perpetrated by ourselves. Most people are safe and know the rules and carry their guns in the correct manner. But then I see incidents like this that make me shudder at the thought guns becoming a common thing. I don't want to be on guard and paranoid when I'm on base and for eyeing everyone to be the new normal. I feel pretty secure knowing that it's protected. It's just that the risk/reward doesn't add up in my head. Personal experience: on base, one of the tech schoolers pulled a knife in the area's ""Club.""

All members will be tracked on an authorization letter, and will carry a card/memorandum/or other authorizing document on their person at all times.   It's an 522, we already (kinda) do this. Redundant. If you're allowed to handle firearms we shouldn't further restrict that.    Firearms will not be carried where restricted by the wing commander. This should include, flightline, industrial areas, maintenance areas, or any areas where it could interfere with your duties or be in danger of falling, snagging, or bumping.    This is literally everywhere in the world ever. I get what you're saying, each base is different and would have site specific rules. Makes sense but the word choice is poor. .   But be limited to area such as, eating and shopping areas, outdoor common areas, or any area that would be considered acceptable to carry in an off-base civilian environment.   This varies hugely state to state, so yeah would need further definition.    Firearms will remain holstered, safety on, in condition 3 and concealed at all times (unintentional exposure is inevitable, let's use common sense here). Violators will loose their authorization to carry.   What's condition 3 on a Glock 19 with no thumb safety like the M9?    Members will be authorized to carry off base in uniform in areas authorized by state and local laws/guidance. a member may carry in uniform off base as long as they adhere to state laws, if they do not meet the criteria for carrying on base, they will not carry on base.   The individual states (NJ, MA, CT, etc) would have a conniption with this one. It could be an interesting way to force a discussion about federalizing may/shall issue statues and such, but I don't ever see it happening.   I think you've got some good thoughts here but I think we'd need to really think it out. There's already a fair bit of documentation on who is/is not able to carry a firearm, so the question becomes what is the federal standard for concealed carry? And if there is a federal standard, can a state further restrict that?"
AirForce,3e0mui,adverseaction,2,Tue Jul 21 20:14:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, but would like to ad a yearly psychological evaluation, allow all NCOs to carry, open carry instead of concealed like armorers do for the M9. Open carry would allow a more vigilant public and everyone would know who had a weapon."
AirForce,3e0mui,thulfs,2,Tue Jul 21 02:16:45 2015 UTC,"I can get on board with the annual eval.  But as far as everyone being allowed to carry openly, I have some reservations against giving out government issued weapons like candy just because they have more than 3 stripes"

AirForce,3e0mui,demintheAF,5,Tue Jul 21 01:23:50 2015 UTC,I'd like to ask what changes from me being able to carry off base everywhere vs. carrying on base. I'm still the same law abiding citizen on and off base. The base perimeter doesn't change my right to self-defense.   It's primarily the reason why my wife and I will not live on base.
AirForce,3e0mui,NotJeff_Goldblum,-7,Tue Jul 21 01:40:04 2015 UTC,"Use your brain.  There are all sorts of sensitive targets on there.  It is way, WAY too big of a risk letting people carry guns on base.  Like I said OP's ideas are at least sensible, but if any form of carry on base gets passed I feel so sorry for security forces."
AirForce,3e0mui,NotJeff_Goldblum,5,Tue Jul 21 01:47:13 2015 UTC,Use your brain.   I'm honestly trying to put myself into your perspective but I'm still not seeing it.    There are all sorts of sensitive targets on there.   That's exactly why CCW is a logical solution. The most valuable target in my mind is children's school/daycare. If I were a psychopath that wanted to inflict the most amount of damage I would target weak targets that could not fight back. This is literately the entire reason for CCW.   What do you think happens off base? Do you think there are random shooting and violence because of CCW? Or do you think that CCW may actually have a role in society?
AirForce,3e0mui,adverseaction,-10,Tue Jul 21 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"When you control who has the guns, you can mitigate most of the threat.  If every joe on base is carrying a gun, any one of them could potentially be an assassin to a visiting DV or a general officer, or attack a SCIF, etc.  If only security forces have the guns, and they are doing their job at the gate to weed out other people who might be sneaking one out, then in theory by default the bad guys can't get a gun on base.  If we were allowed to bring guns on base, the bad guys would not even have to sneak it on base.  That obstacle is eliminated.  They now have easy access to do potentially grave damage to national security.  It can't/won't be allowed in our lifetime.  I truly believe that.  Also you can trace this policy back all the way to the beginning.  It's hard to even find the roots of no guns on post.. it was written into DoD directive back in '93 but it was a policy long before that, dating back to WWI and possibly earlier."
AirForce,3e0mui,NotJeff_Goldblum,14,Tue Jul 21 01:54:34 2015 UTC,"When you control who has the guns, you can mitigate most of the threat.   Absolutely agree.

When's the last time your car was strip searched at the gate? You have no idea how easy it is to sneak guns on base do you?   Not as easy as you think.  They have dogs that can smell bullet powder.  My car has been randomly searched at least 3 times this past year.   Again you lost me here. Right now, today, I can lawfully bring guns on base. As many guns as I want. I can drive right onto base with them...lawfully. I have to show a card that SF issues with all the firearms and serial numbers on it.

Guns haven't been allowed on base for the past 60+ years.. there must be a damn good reason for that, I just named several.  It takes one guy with a gun walking into a room and killing a VIP to cause exepectionally grave damage to national security.  It can't be allowed.  The risk is far too great, that it far outweighs the risk of not letting us carry.  We are expendable"
AirForce,3e0mui,adverseaction,4,Tue Jul 21 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"If someone had a meeting with a bunch of VIPs and wanted to kill them, they wouldn't need a CCW to do it.  They can legally enter the base with the weapons and go on their shooting spree.

AirForce,3e0mui,NotJeff_Goldblum,-7,Tue Jul 21 02:27:30 2015 UTC,"No they can't.  They wouldn't get in a controlled area with the weapons or anywhere near any place on base that isn't the armory / firing range.  like I said to the other guy, use your brain.

No reason to get defensive. If you really think that searches work at the gate then how did Fort Hood and the Navy yard happen? BTW, the Navy yard shooter had access to a SCIF.   If the searches at the gate really worked then I would not be pushing for CCW on base.    They have dogs that can smell bullet powder.   WTF! You honestly believe that? Please ask an SF guy.   The dogs in fact are not trained to smell powder or traditional ammunition. How do I know this? Because again, I bring guns on base all the time (lawfully)   My car has been randomly searched at least 3 times this past year.   So 3 times out of the 1000's you travel between the gate each year. That doesn't sound like a system that would stop any criminals...at all.    It has to be locked with the ammunation separated and you have to go directly to the armory.   Nope. You're way off on this. I can travel to housing, the range, to a friends house, and the armory with firearms on base. In fact, I can go on base with all my guns and ammo and never need to go to the armory. All lawful.     We're talking about our brothers and sisters in blue here.   Ah so then there's no need to carry, right?   I like how you think this logic is silly but it's your logic. You're the one that thinks CCW will lead to blood in the streets   The reason I know I'm correct and you're wrong, is that DoD and Congress is on my side of this argument   We're done here. You have no interest in discussing this topic. You don't care what other people think because you believe you're right. There's no chance for you to grow or learn anything.    It takes one guy with a gun walking into a room and killing a VIP to cause exepectionally grave damage to national security. It can't be allowed.   Please tell me again how criminals follow laws.

A better phrasing would be Republican (their party platform has a pro-gun plank) vs Democrat (their party platform has an anti-gun plank). Both parties of course use flowery language but at the heart of the matter that's what they believe at the end of the day. Again, exceptions exist on both sides here but you can still point and say, ""yup they spelled their position out right there"".

PCS MALT Plus is authorized for an eligible member or dependent en route to the VPC for the PCS travel between the authorized points.  The automobile mileage rate is paid for one round-trip between the old/new PDS and VPC official distance determined by DTOD when POV pick-up or delivery is separate from the PCS travel. PCS MALT reimbursement for an eligible civilian employee is authorized for one-way travel for the official distance determined by DTOD when the POV pick-up or delivery is separate from the PCS travel.

That way, you actually have a say in where your career takes you. Assuming the Air Force even lets you stay in, you're going to be reclassed into a ""needs of the Air Force"" job, which will almost certainly be worse than what you've got yourself now. Honestly man, the grass is always greener. You've managed to land yourself one of the better career fields in the Air Force, not just the job itself but all of the perks, cool TDYs and deployments, good gear, etc. I say stick with it. If you really really really still hate it when your retraining window comes up, then you can do that."
AirForce,3e19bf,LowgapBro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:34:47 2015 UTC,Ya that's true too. I forgot the retraining window is before my full 6 year enlistment right? I'm definitely not gonna make any brash decisions yet I just wanted to check out my options.

AirForce,3e19bf,modern_quill,4,Tue Jul 21 07:53:58 2015 UTC,"If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't quit. It's hard to judge the career field based on the Tech School, which is supposed to be a pain in the butt. Getting through SERE school isn't something that just anyone can do, and in doing so you accomplish something that no one can ever take away from you. Maybe somewhere down the line you decide that being a SERE instructor isn't for you, and that's fine, but stay the course. You may get through training and find out that you really enjoy what you do.  Knowing SERE instructors outside the training environment, it's very different to be on the instructor side of things than to be in the trainee side of things.  It's not like you're going to have to go to work Monday through Friday and eat a bowl of grubs until 1100 and then get punched in the gut until 1400. :)"

I've seen people with Top Secret clearances still get Security Forces, Maintenance, etc. It's a crap shoot.  Although my view of what they did was limited, SERE seemed like a pretty sweet gig. At the Squadron level, seemed like it was just 2 dudes who got their own office and set their own hours, met annual training requirements for Air Crew, and some involvement in mission planning.  I will say, it's EXTREMELY unlikely to get reclassed into being a Linguist. Also, 1B4's to my knowledge, are mostly all cross-trainees.

While we where getting cashed out, a obvious marine or army (hair cut and demeanor) came up to us and starting giving us shit about stolen valor.  I'm not the nicest guy, i told him to fuck off and go pester some one else, we had nothing to prove to this jerk  bag. After i told him to buzz off, he gets in my face and threatens "" I will rip that fucking uniform off you, you fake ass faggot."" I then pull out my blue retiree card and told him i wouldn't file attempted assault charges if he walked away. Which he did.   TLDR: Got harassed at a gas station after airsofting, did not respond well."

Their website has a note saying that it falls on us, as the students, to ensure we're studying the most recent material (by checking the site). their next note states that editions will update as grammatical errors are corrected or material is removed as it's no longer applicable to completing the course.  I'm over this whole thing, I think the responsibility of notifying students of edition changes falls on the Barnes Center, not on us. Also, a change log of what was fixed/removed (like with CDCs) would be helpful. I just opened the 4th editions and they have the same page numbers as their 3rd edition counterparts.

Ill make the assumption that you have over 3 years TIS, for a base pay of 2,238.00 a month without consideration of extra allowances or otherwise.  Go through your current expenses, and make a line by line list of where your money is going. Start evaluating how you prioritize your spending, and what can be eliminated. To actually make a decent dent in those debts, you probably should aim to make around 400-500 in payments a month, that's your immediate goal to free up.  Now go through and make a line by line listing of your debts, their interest rates, and who services the debt. A note that consolidation services will #rekt your credit for a decent amount of time. Prioritize those debts in order of interest rates, and you can form a payoff plan.   Now that you have all of this shit written out, call your creditors. If you explain your situation, your plan to pay everything off, and can get the right CSR you may be able to talk down a decent interest rate cut.

Get it for the total amount you need, and then pay off all your debts using that money, and then start paying off the loan.  For $7500, you're probably looking at $200-250 a month at 4-6 years financed.  But it's much more manageable.  Honestly, $7500 isn't that bad. At all."

I don't necessarily disagree with a loan, but if they have that much debt they might not be able to get a loan at that low of a rate.

The difference being (hopefully) that you have an asset with substantial value once you bring the amount of the loan down. If your original loan amount for your home and the amount of the payoff are too close, it absolutely CAN count against your credit rating.

AFPC receives the package then forwards it to the CFM. CFM reviews the package and does the interview. CFM picks and chooses who will continue. When done, CFM passes the approved packages to APFC who then see if each applicant still qualifies for retrain (retain ability, assignments, etc.). If everything looks good, AFPC looks for a class date for the applicant.   The CFM review/interview replaces the traditional monthly rack and stack board everyone else goes through <---- from my understanding.   I submitted my package yesterday, and today the status of my application has changed from AFPC review to CFM review. So I am now waiting on an email from the CFM."

Sad fact: There is Nothing in macon to do. Period. You'll have to venture forth.  Take weekend trips to Helen, GA. Bring friends if you can. It's an old town with plenty of festivities/food but its main attraction is its river tubing which is extremely cheap. Helicopter rides/ziplining are also available.   Piedmont Park in Atlanta is really cool if you aren't homophobic. ( I say that as a fair warning due to actually hearing people say they wont go because of the large portion of its usual demographic ). There are always events happening, music fests/concerts/cookouts/etc. You can rent rollerblades/skates/skateboards/bikes/trikes at a small shop across the street from its main gate (opposite side from Grady Highschool) for like $5 an hour or somethin.  If you like to party, Atlanta is ripe for the pickin's. Check out Opera(mixed artists), Quad(Electronic/House), Vanquish/Reign/FlipFlops. Club Havana is going more towards Buckhead. Central Buckhead has a fuckload of bars, if you need a point of reference look up Buckhead Saloon and check out the surrounding area. Want to try some amazing steak? 'STK' across the street from Club Vanquish is outstanding. STK is attached to the Loews Hotel which I worked Valet for, chances are if you take a stroll by its front doors you'll see some famous people(actors/governors/entrepreneurs/etc).  /u/BucksMcGruff mentions Stone Mountain and I concur. Fairly cheap admission, laser shows every so often ( I think saturday/sunday nights?), a nice trail to hike or you can take the trolley to the top of the mountain.  The Mall of Georgia is pretty cool. Sometimes they stage events in the front courtyard. They also do valet parking for some reason - if you're feelin fancy, and there are lots of good food places in the surrounding area (literally hundreds).  I'm not sure the name of this place, but if you google ""Rotating restaurant Atlanta"" youll find it. A rotating restaurant atop a hotel, it gives you a gorgeous view of the city and overlooks Centennial Olympic Park. It is not cheap.  Go get a greasy burger from The Varsity in downtown Atl. Just to say you did it.   The High Museum of Art is cool.  Woodruff Arts Museum is cool.  Dahlonega Gold Museum is cool.  Six Flags is obvious.  The Fox Theatre if you're feelin fancy.  Sigh I miss Atlanta. I do not miss Macon/Warner Robins. That place is tragic as fuck."

I have enough time before work to get chores and errands done and I can ride my bike to work.  On days, I end up just snoozing until 0430 and then rushing to work.  I feel like I have more time on my hands on my off days.  It's probably a placebo, but I wake up earlier on my off days than I do when I work days, so I have more time to do things.

I used to be maintenance, so I know how other training records look. You wouldn't use a faulty reference, tool, or technical order in a flyer's training record.    AA is the same. This is not a one-size-fits-all type of fix.  If someone is diagnosed with a substance use disorder, why should AA be the only thing I know to use? What if they too are atheist?

The book basically says ""this is the ONLY way to get better, there is no other way."" I did not get anything useful out of it as a counselor. That being said, the reason we have to read the book is because the certification entity the AF uses is called the ICRC and it's probably one of the most widely recognized substance abuse certifications in the world. Many of these annoying requirements come from the ICRC not the Air Force, unfortunately."

The chaplains aren't supposed to make it specific to any one religion, but they always do (quoting scripture, specific names, etc).  It always alienates the 40% of the force that is non-religious.

AirForce,3dzi69,Thoradius,3,Mon Jul 20 23:21:31 2015 UTC,"They can make you read the book.  They can't make you practice the religion.  If AA is the foundation of the AF's substance abuse program, then you had damned well better understand it.  Are you afraid that you'll be converted by reading a book other than the bible?"
AirForce,3dzi69,IAmUber,2,Mon Jul 20 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, it's not the foundation, in fact, it's rarely mentioned.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing are the techniques that are most often used. I hesitate to say ""foundation"" because we're a medical career field.  While a band-aid may be appropriate for someone with a papercut, you wouldn't use it for an amputee. (pardon the exaggeration, just trying to make a point)   AA has only ever been mentioned in our clinic when a patient WANTS additional support outside of the clinical environment.    Awareness of resources and what they offer is important, just like a First Sergeant should know about the types of things AFRC and other base agencies offer.  The question isn't whether they can or can't make you read the book, it's whether it is appropriate.  AA's success rate isn't something to brag about, either, but that's a different issue.    The 12 steps of AA refer repeatedly to God. They require admitting you are powerless, accepting that only a Higher Power can help you, turning your will and your life over to God, taking a moral inventory, admitting your wrongs, being ready to let God remove your shortcomings, making amends to those you have harmed, improving your conscious contact with God through prayer and meditation, and spreading the word.  That doesn't sound appropriate to me, but I believe in science.    Again, while AA works for some people, we should be teaching when it is appropriate to use, not that it's a primary tool in someone's toolbox."

Service members who reside off-base should proceed with caution if their spouse, dependent, roommate or anyone brings marijuana or drug paraphernalia into their residence. Even if a service member is not the individual who intends to or uses the marijuana, the fact that the marijuana is present in their private residence may lead a court to determine that the service member constructively possessed it.  Constructive possession means a person has legal possession of an object, even if they do not have direct physical control over it. In other words, if a service member knows that marijuana is in their home and they can access it if he or she so chooses, they could be found to have constructive possession of the marijuana."

For example I was working helicopters at my last active duty base. So I just applied to work on helicopters. After about 6 months of hearing nothing. I looked for any job that would hire me. You need to get on the hangar floor. Once in start making contacts and networking. That's how you get jobs in civilian aviation.
AirForce,3dvi97,ISFWes,2,Sun Jul 19 23:51:11 2015 UTC,"Depends, the civilian side of stuff is different than the military. Working for an airline you may not do any heavy mx. They might contract it out. Your best course of action eight now is to get some good examples of both and see what you want to do."
AirForce,3dvi97,ISFWes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:51:59 2015 UTC,My dad works for American Airlines after getting out of avionics in the Marines. He's worked at airports and maintenance shops. Seems like a pretty good gig.
AirForce,3dvi97,Rwhit,3,Mon Jul 20 12:08:12 2015 UTC,"With two years left. Learn as much as possible about the other career fields as you can. Avionics, Crew Chief and Engines. Don't worry about weapons. Go hang out with sheet metal and pick up the basics. To get an A&P you have to know the basics of all of the systems."
AirForce,3dvi97,manthemike12,2,Sun Jul 19 22:10:29 2015 UTC,In general would they be cool with that? If a hydro troop comes in and asks to train/help with some tasks? Wow I mean I could be signed off on other AFSC tasks? I'm friends with A1Cs and SrA from those shops but I'm just wary if their NCOs would be cool with it.
AirForce,3dvi97,ISFWes,4,Sun Jul 19 23:08:13 2015 UTC,Have you done any cut training? Same thing just without the paperwork. That how I got my A&P. As avionics I always had to wait till the engine guys ran the planes before I could go. So I ended up helping them out to get the work done. After awhile I had done the task enough to help show the newer engine guys.   As soon as I knew I was getting out I would hang with the sheet metal guys. Sometimes on my own time. Also on TDYs I would help out.
AirForce,3dvi97,ndrew452,2,Sun Jul 19 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"Let your supervision know your interests. You'll likely have to do it on your own time, but it should just take one phone call from the right person and you'll be in there after your shift drilling some rivets!   Working with other shops is a lot easier when it comes to cut training as long as you've got the right attitude.   If I were your supervisor, I'd do everything in my power to get you your cut training as long as you were solid on your primary duties."
AirForce,3dvi97,ISFWes,2,Sun Jul 19 23:40:28 2015 UTC,"Start saving money, regardless of what you do liquid money is needed to avoid debt.  I don't know much about the education required for aircraft maintenance but there has be so some professional/technical education and certifications required to work in the civilian side.  Use that GI Bill don't let it go to waste.  Go guard.  So much different than active duty, especially on the flightline. A lot more relaxed and the guys that have been there for years genuinely care about the unit and planes. A unique thing about that Guard is that you will have msgts that have been working on the same planes for 20 years.  They know every nut and bolt on the thing."

AirForce,3dvi97,PowerhouseJay,2,Sun Jul 19 23:17:56 2015 UTC,"Right now, it's too early for you to look at future jobs.  When you have 6-9 months left, start casually browsing airline/airport hiring sites to get an idea what is out there.  Go to job fairs that cater to the military and start polishing your resume.  Make sure it looks good, as you want to stand out.  When you have 3-6 months left, start applying (note that this should be closer to 3 months, not 6).  If you are flexible on your location, the odds on you securing a job are better.  Save up your leave, because that will count towards your terminal leave, which provides a cushion in case the new job doesn't start right away.   Most importantly, have a back up plan.  It's not easy securing a job, while the job market is healthier than it was a few years ago, but it still isn't great.  There is a lot of competition.  I was looking for a new job and it took me 4 months to get a job offer, and I had 5 years military experience, previous private sector management experience, and an MBA.  So that means, save up some money to live off of in case you find yourself needing to live with zero income.  It also might mean going to school and living off the GI bill and a part time job.   Also, one last word of advice.  The private sector still has its share of bullshit.  Sure, you won't get your vacation delayed and your working hours will be better because of overtime, but trust me, there will still be bullshit.  Paying for healthcare and dental insurance as well as state income tax sort of sucks (unless you move to a no state income tax state).  You will also be introduced to the wonderful world of PTO.  Get sick? well guess you lose out on some vacation days.  Say goodbye to 2.5 days off per month because you will be extremely lucky if you land a job that even offers vacation in the first year."

AirForce,3dvi97,Not_A_Greenhouse,2,Mon Jul 20 00:27:33 2015 UTC,"Aviation is hit or miss on the outside. Really research and find out what YOU really want to do in aviation. A lot of the regional airlines hire no experience, new mechanics all the time, but the pay is on the low end. You need to be open to other careers/jobs other than civilian aviation. Just have a back up plan in case you can't find a decent aviation job. One of the best paying, blue collar jobs out there is the railroad. Excellent pay and bennies. Just something to ponder on. Good luck to you!"

But being admin sure there are positions where you are but still left up to ""needs of the air force"" . Its a big gamble I wouldn't take lightly."

She hasn't worked any job relative to her skill set thus far, so we're trying to look in a different direction now. We know it's a contract you sign and then you're such with.

There are couples who've made it work, but we cried uncle after a two year stretch on opposite deployment schedules - roughly three months cumulative time together.  Having and raising kids like this can be extremely challenging.  The worst part is that (considering the extreme cost of child care) getting a job can actually set you back.   You've experienced that enlisted pay is not fantastic - if you need to be the stable element of your household, you can probably find comparable pay doing jobs for which you are over-qualified.

So do not count on it, especially since it took the mpf until the week before I graduated from tech school to finally put me down as married -- I got hurlburt by lucky chance instead of by join spouse.  Thankfully my job can be pretty much anywhere so we'll probably be together, but as much as the af claims to be about family they pretty much don't give a fuck.

(she was 3A and they can go anywhere) went to the fishbowl and had new orders 10 minutes later. granted it could have went horribbly wrong but the biggest thing is having AFSC's that jive together. going officer will be a bitch with those degrees. without doing ROTC i believe they mostly value STEM degrees.
AirForce,3dwsx0,hipsterstripes,2,Mon Jul 20 06:32:04 2015 UTC,"I am a mil to mil enlisted member, married to another enlisted member.  Intel to medical and have always had great luck with assignments.  AFSCs are the biggest thing to look at when considering how easy it will be to get a join spouse assignment.  Obviously if one of you is limited to where you can go, its tougher to match assignments.  The downsides are short tours and deployments, but those as downsides regardless.  If your wife goes in as an O, you will have a much much more difficult time matching assignments because Os PCS on a different schedule, have career paths and after she makes Capt can compete for jobs.  That makes it tougher for AFPC to match your assignments.  I am not telling her not to go in as a O, just get some good advice from one of your officers about how their assignment process works and if you can find one that is mil to mil, even better.   Else, the pay is good, everything gets a little tougher as you gain rank but if you can both make it to 20, 2 retirement checks and whats left of retirement benifits would be great."

I am an intel imagery guy, I can only goto about 14 bases (look at AMS, also be sure to look at 5 and 7 level, the list could adjust as you make rank), my wife is medical of course she can goto all 14 of those, so that helped AFPC.  Are you comm, or do you work with a specific airframe?  What bases can you goto?  For example, if your on 16s and she is u2s, that would limit the bases you could go to to only a few.  Do your research before you talk to the recruiter."

Keep in mind that join spouse might have here stationed at Eglin since it's still close so having that as an option to be stationed at is good. When she gets qualified at MEPS have her list those jobs if she qualified for them. Hell check to see if Tyndall is on those lists also and live half way in between if needed.

Called back and found out we're back to square one.  I deploy quite often, but for only a few months at a time, so we decided to live in base housing with our tight budget so that no matter what happens we have a roof over our head, so a roommate is out of the question. She's tried many jobs already. A few hotels on the beach, a little local life insurance company, even the CDC on base. There's a lot of people in this area, so there's very few open jobs and when she gets a job, it's very little hours and not a whole lot of pay. Our budget is fine. We eat out here and there, but nothing too bad. We might be able to live solely off of me if it wasn't for her student loans, but that's without saving anything and living paycheck to  paycheck.

If you're easily jaded and like to complain, well.....good luck with that  More specifically, recruiting is almost a different branch entirely. Sometimes you don't even feel like you're in especially in my case being in a major city about 2 hrs from the closest base. The culture is different and they give you a lot of leeway, if you learn to embrace ""drinking the blue koolaid"" and realize you are actually helping a lot of people it can be really fun and rewarding. People in the Air Force love to complain about being in, but you'll see how hard it can be for a lot of folks out there, who you will legit want to get in, whether it be their family situation or just that they went to a community college and arent doing shit.   It's really not bad at all, just enjoy it while you can.  Also you learn a lot about the job process ad how it REALLY works, you'll see that recruiters aren't evil and 99% want whats best for our DEPPers.

I'd imagine that wouldn't be a bad gig at all, there would  only be maybe 1 or 2 places you'd have to show presence at and most of the military brats living there are all mostly told to go Air Force by their parents serving in the Marines and Army. Plus you wouldn't have to deal with the druggies and homeless people, military brats are for the most part pretty well behaved kids and know the military processes, less explaining and less selling since they already know the jist of it.

My Flight Chief was imprisoned and I had two flight mates get kicked out for doing the wrong things. and as a whole, the Sq I was in sucked.  However, I made the most of it.

AirForce,3dtxrf,retrospectr3,7,Mon Jul 20 00:06:47 2015 UTC,"The largest overpayment was $26,317, Ramstein officials said in June.   and all this occurred between 2009 and 2012?  Even if you gave this airman the benefit of a doubt there's no way you could overlook a $730/month mistake and not say the airman was negligent in not reporting this.  My first roommate was overpaid over the course of 3 years a very minor amount (something like $50/month that you'd honestly not notice); he ended up having to pay back the Air Force before his enlistment was up even though it was completely unintentional finance decided they would not forgive the debt."
AirForce,3dtxrf,twelveparsex,13,Sun Jul 19 13:04:16 2015 UTC,"You make a fair point, but that is not what is actually going on with these debts. What happened was you used to be allowed to have gas (or another utility) added to your rent as a fixed cost, but as long as you still had additional utilities to pay out of pocket you received the utility allowance. It has been like this in Germany for the last 30+ years, but they changed that rule about 2 years ago. They grandfathered everyone who was still in a housing contract that was drawn up like that. Now they are coming back around saying they should not have grandfathered anyone, and they want the money back. That article touches on it in the last few paragraphs, but tries to make it sound like they were paid ""double"" utilities, but that is not accurate."
AirForce,3dtxrf,fastburner,7,Sun Jul 19 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Most of the Airmen who were ""overpaid"" never even saw the money, it was just added in their rental agreements and all of those overpayments were sent directly to the landlords in the form of BAH. So, what's even worse is that the people who are having to repay their debts were never actually paid that money in the first place.   Under the old system, your landlord could, for example, add an extra 200 Euro a month to your rent payment as a utility charge in exchange for paying your gas/electric/trash bills at a flat rate. The housing office pays you whatever your rent cost is, up to a certain limit, and you transfer that money directly to the landlord. So, it's not like these airmen were walking around with an extra 20k in their bank accounts like nothing was wrong"
AirForce,3dtxrf,Afterfx21,2,Sun Jul 19 14:13:33 2015 UTC,That assumes that the airmen knew what the actual allowance amount was supposed to be.

OHA gives you exactly what your rent is adjusted each month for the current exchange rates.  This allows for some fluctuation which can hide small overpayments quite easily.  But from the article a lot of these people were collecting way more money than they should have been.     Maj. Bryon McGarry said the highest overpayment so far appears to be $29,700, the lowest $8.     Over a period of at most three years being generous that highest overpayment comes out to over $800 extra each month.  You don't overlook that accidentally."

That message was that we had to show up on our day off (a Wednesday) at 0500 (we work swing shift) for force on force training. The new Airman went through the same exact training two weeks ago and I tried to get him out of it by going to the flight chief who is 8 months from retiring. When I asked him he looked at me with that look of desperation so I called the S3T NCOIC who also told me he had no idea but to have him show up anyways. Thats bullshit, its all bullshit.

I don't think many people have this fear, because most people are mentally stable and don't stab or shoot someone over that kind of thing.   The situation I gave was more about the potential for violence, not the potential result of that violence. Obviously guns are more potent weapon than knives, but a knife is still plenty enough to kill that asshole giving you paperwork right now. The potential exists all the time, but is not a concern.

Yes ANY weapon can be used for mass murder but some are better than others at it, is the point I was making. You will have a much harder time killing 30 people with your leatherman than a handgun.

It'd just be nice to not have my life ruined by leaving it in my car or going to the BX.  I don't get why people have to have it all or nothing.  Seems to me like it'd be pretty easy to compromise.  Alot of people don't want to carry because of how incompetent people are, other people just want to carry.  You could have a stadardized holster (open carry or concealed) with a mag pouch on it.  Carry the pistol on safe in the holster, no round chambered.  Keep a fully loaded mag next to it.  I think we should be able to carry however we want (not opposed to mandatory training, however - think motorcycles), but if we couldn't agree on that, maybe a compromise liek that would work."
AirForce,3dw866,AnalJelly,5,Mon Jul 20 16:55:48 2015 UTC,I'm all for this but there needs to be some thing in place to ensure people carrying on base are fully qualified to conceal carry.   Of course since some states are so easy to get the license there needs to be a class held on base that is mandatory and includes some kind of qualification training.

A lot of them cross train to get off the gates and have very little care of actually teaching anything.   There are some in those shops that know what they are doing and what they are talking about.

AirForce,3dw866,thatswhatshisaid,2,Mon Jul 20 04:17:20 2015 UTC,"Because in some states just because he can carry doesn't mean he's qualified or has any idea what he's doing.

AirForce,3dw866,thatswhatshisaid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:48 2015 UTC,Because this is exactly what happens when someone doesn't have proper training in regards to CC carrying a firearm in a holster with some kind of active retention and carrying it in a leather holster that is only passive retention are completely different things.   When you don't make sure people have proper training prior to carrying shit like this happens.   http://news.yahoo.com/u-navy-recruiter-shoots-himself-leg-georgia-215310697.html  Georgia also does not require military to have a license to conceal carry. Your CAC is your license to carry in Georgia.

And the last thing I want is A1C Dipshit carrying under his ABUs and having a desk pop.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=948-2Vzgi3w
AirForce,3dw866,daays,10,Mon Jul 20 01:33:35 2015 UTC,"Why are you ok with them carrying a loaded firearm at war but not at home? Why do you think ""A1C Dipshit"" is going to negligently discharge his weapon once a week? Do you not realize how many people carry concealed around you every day without a single incident? I don't understand why you are so scared of arming military members. Do you think they will be issued an M9 straight out of basic? Like every single person will have a pistol at all times? I think the only people who will carry on base are the ones that carry off base already. It just allows them to carry their gun while on base. Just because you don't trust someone doesn't mean they can't be trusted."
AirForce,3dw866,AnalJelly,4,Mon Jul 20 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"Because (and I know this is against the grain for a lot of you) I don't think the answer to issues of gun violence is more guns. But maybe that's just me. And just because you can fire @ CATM once a year or more, doesn't mean when under pressure you're going to hit your target in an active shooter situation. We have people trained to respond to situations that require that level of force for a reason."
AirForce,3dw866,daays,6,Mon Jul 20 01:55:22 2015 UTC,I open carried a M9 for 120 days on my deployment..  Guess what.. Nothing happened. The issue I have is I am an open target LEAVING BASE in uniform. I am not armed yet holy shit look at me...   If we were allowed to CC I would leave my weapon in my car.  You wouldn't be able to have it on the line anyways.  I CC when Im not on base you would never know that I was. I dont mess with it or touch it. I do a tap on it entering and leaving my car as a mental reference that I have it.
AirForce,3dw866,AnalJelly,5,Mon Jul 20 02:10:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not doubting you man. But you and I know not everyone operates or thinks the same way. Great, you're responsible and know how to handle your self WRT firearms. However, every one of us knows someone who doesn't need to be carrying on base. Are they in the military? Sure, but just because you signed on the dotted line and can fire at fixed targets in a controlled environment doesn't mean you need to be (read: or should be) carrying a firearm on base when it has nothing to do with your official duties."
AirForce,3dw866,TheCorvus303,2,Mon Jul 20 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"but what is stopping that person from carrying at Walmart? Nothing.  Even if they were going to go postal I don't think the current rule is gonna stop them.   They are going to get a gun they are going to bring it on base.  Where I was EVERYONE carried.  Nothing happened.  Nobody shot anyone.  That guy you're thinking right now, depends where he deploys he will have 15 rounds in his M9 that he will be carrying.  We are in the mother fucking military we kill people.  If someone is in the military who shouldn't carry they shouldn't be employed in the DOD."

I picture myself in an active shooter situation and instead of fighting back, I'll be stuck hiding under a table in the middle of my shop. Maybe I can throw some tools at him before he can hit me with one of his bullets. What's the average response time for an active shooter situation? If someone did decide to go postal where I work it would be a fucking mess. By the time someone called it in and then someone was dispatched, best case scenario, 2 minutes. Versus having someone sitting in that room that is already equipped to at least make an attempt."

AirForce,3dw866,daays,2,Mon Jul 20 03:00:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you fix it by reallocating SAPR/Resiliency funding toward recurring weapons qualification & weapon safety training. If a good portion of the military can't be trusted with M9's, then we have bigger issues to worry about."
AirForce,3dw866,OnthefarWind,5,Mon Jul 20 01:37:56 2015 UTC,Yeah man because that's so likely to happen. The number of incidents in which SAPR/Resiliency training may be useful far outweigh the number of incidents in which having multiple armed (non-SFS) airmen present and carrying would help. All this is is a knee-jerk reaction.
AirForce,3dw866,proROKexpat,-5,Mon Jul 20 01:41:11 2015 UTC,Totally a knee-jerk reaction. The shooting which happened last week was TOTALLY an isolated incident and shouldn't happen again.
AirForce,3dw866,AnalJelly,8,Mon Jul 20 01:43:13 2015 UTC,"No one said it wouldn't happen again. What I am saying though is that this is not the right response. You don't honestly think allowing every airman to concealed carry on base is a good idea do you? Do you not pay attention to the people you work and coexist with? You're far more trusting than I, I guess.   Also, the down vote button is not a disagree button."
AirForce,3dw866,kabamman,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's not a disagree button. You're missing the point. See CerwinVegas55's comment, it will clear it up for you.  Also, if members were allowed to CCW while in uniform, you could easily reduce casualties when a coward is looking for as many soft targets as possible. Even if it saves one life, it's worth it."

AirForce,3dskgz,Hungryandsweaty,2,Sun Jul 19 03:41:39 2015 UTC,I agree but I don't think they should mask that accomplishment. Maybe weight it somehow.

My Group Chief was on a board a few years back for SMSgt, and shared much of the same advice when I asked him to look over my records to see if I ws competitive for the cycle this year. Not too much changed from what you listed above, but it helped define what I had to work on from beginning of 2013 when they started talking about the MSgt Boards in the future. I missed master first time around, but I wasn't ready studying wise. Second time around, his advice helped define and clinch what I was lacking in from my immediate supervision from the 2 eprs in between PECD of last year."
AirForce,3dskgz,Fire_At_Night,3,Sun Jul 19 06:47:00 2015 UTC,"/u/MountainKnuckle did some homework. For those that didn't make it this board, please heed. His advice is pretty solid in his OP for what a board is looking for in a MSgt.   You're going to get rated against sustained performance. This means awards you have garnered, to include awards for those you have mentored, for even things as basic as Performer of the Month for your Sq.  Capture all of it on your own EPR, and how you specifically influenced your subordinates' successes. Transitioning from E-6 to E-7 should focus on how you lead and manage your team, flight, or section against the rest of your squadron, group, or wing, with the impact being related to whatever your mission set is.  Show how, and quantify how much your leadership saved money, time, or amplified group or wing influence. This is the future. Make sure all of your amn knock out CCAF stuff, and your NCOs knock out Course 15 if you want to make a future board successful for yourself and them as you lead the team.  This is what it will come down too for Promote, Must Promote, Promote Now. Make sure your team has the boxes checked to give them the leg up as the AF transitions from the old EPR mentality of firewall 5s to the new most people are average mentality."

AirForce,3dskgz,dipsis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:01:47 2015 UTC,I was actually working on one but I wanted to make sure I had all the information correct before posting anything. The biggest takeaway for me after going to the briefing they gave was most people will be a 'promote'. There are no quotas for the 'promote' marking (only the 'early promote' and 'must promote'. Only 10% of E-7s can get the senior rater endorsement and 20% of E-8s can get the senior rater endorsement. These top rankings are all across AFSCs so you will be competing against everyone to get them (for example an admin person would be competing with a maintainer if they are in the same unit).

We've also got top notch fishing, hunting, rafting, snowboarding, mountain biking...   The only real downside is the actual base location versus where the fun stuff is. The base is on a crappy area with tons of wind and sagebrush. Takes about an hour to get to some foresty stuff, another hour to get to the real fun stuff.

AirForce,3dsvzl,paintisagoodprogram,8,Sun Jul 19 03:26:04 2015 UTC,"I see you said you were allergic to an unknown irritant, where was the reaction if you don't mind me asking. I had a reaction to the key chain they made us wear around our necks.   Did you ever get an allergy test where they poke you with 854395 needles to try and find something? Or was it a ""we don't know sorry kid""?  I am not a doctor nor do I really know the process of going through the steps again but I feel if you didn't get a solid answer or them trying a test you should be able to try and get back in."
AirForce,3dsvzl,2T1X1Munz,3,Sun Jul 19 04:46:56 2015 UTC,What happened when you found out you were allergic to the key chain?
AirForce,3dsvzl,FirstReactionFocus,5,Sun Jul 19 05:19:29 2015 UTC,I started getting irritated from it around my 2nd week and told my MTI. At that time she said I could go to med and get a cream for it or tough it out. I decided just not to wear it and put it in a different lanyard we wore. So I always had it in there from 2nd week until the end.   Edit: spelling
AirForce,3dsvzl,2T1X1Munz,3,Sun Jul 19 05:22:29 2015 UTC,"I actually asked the Air Force doctors to perform the allergy test on me but they said they were unwilling the accept the risk I might die during the testing. My lips swelled up during the reaction, and I had hives in a lot of places. We also didn't know that at the time, I had some form of strep.   They basically said we don't know, sorry you're most likely disqualified from military service, time to go to med hold. I'm gonna try to get back in just to get a solid answer from them. Was just looking for some advice from people who went through the same stuff."
AirForce,3dsvzl,CipherClump,6,Sun Jul 19 05:38:49 2015 UTC,At this point you're likely going to have to find out what it is that you're allergic to and get a waiver.
AirForce,3dsvzl,2T1X1Munz,3,Sun Jul 19 06:49:23 2015 UTC,"That sucks they were not willing to do the tests but as u/CipherClump said you might have to go and find out what it is you are allergic to. Go to a clinic, get the test, if all comes out clean take it to a recruiter. If you are indeed allergic you might need a waiver or doctors DQ you. Either way if it is something you want to attempt again go for it."
AirForce,3dsvzl,lupusmagnus11,2,Sun Jul 19 10:29:24 2015 UTC,I would go to a civilian doctor for the allergy test. Don't even try and get the military to do it for you. Then take the results back with you when you try to go to bmt again.
AirForce,3dsvzl,deaddebate,3,Sun Jul 19 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"As u/CipherClump said, go to an allergist and get a comprehensive skin test.  From there, you will likely need further blood testing for the specific, diagnostic level of your allergy to be considered for a waiver.  However, this all may be pointless if your allergy is significant enough to not be waive-able.  But the other half of that coin is you would now know your allergy and treatment for the future.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E#Role_in_diagnosis"
AirForce,3dsvzl,fandry96,2,Sun Jul 19 14:06:37 2015 UTC,I got kicked out for leg problems in basic. I made sure I had it coded to where I could come back. They said I had to get the problem fixed and come back in a year.....took 4 years of paperwork and my waiver went up to the surgeon general of the air force. But I've been in for 8 years now. :D   It's possible....but not easy.
AirForce,3dsvzl,sayalol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:48:22 2015 UTC,"The first thing you need to do is check your discharge paperwork.  There will be a code that says if you're eligible to reenlist or not.  It will also tell you if you can enlist into other branches.  This honestly comes down to a money issue though.  Doctors don't just kick people out for fun.  They have to follow a set of guidelines and you have to meet those guidelines.  Your MEB determined the best course of action was to separate you.  You were in third week and and had an allergic reaction that involved lips swelling.  Allergies are almost always considered pre-existing and because of that, the military prefers to not pay for it and since you were not that far in basic, the military hadn't spent a lot of money on you.  They basically weighed the costs.  It's a crappy situation.  I worked at Reid for 3 and a half years so I'm fairly familiar with the process of separating trainees.  If you're able to reenlist or enlist into another branch, do what everyone else says, get a comprehensive allergy test done.  Know that those are not exactly cheap though.  If you can find out what caused the reaction, you can check to see if it's waiverable and start the process.  Just know that getting a waiver after being separated is a very, very long process.  It's not impossible, but you need to be constantly working on it.  Good luck to you."
AirForce,3dsvzl,2T1X1Munz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:23:51 2015 UTC,"The Air Force did pay a lot of money on him already. He stated he booked crypto linguist as a job. TS clearance, interviews up the ass, lots.   But as everybody has said, check discharge papers, get evaluated by a civilian doctor, and take everything back to the recruiter if your code allows a reenlistment process."
AirForce,3dsvzl,sayalol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:09:34 2015 UTC,"But he has no actually training as a linguist and it's unlikely his TS got cleared by his third week.  They justify separating basic trainees a lot easier than that of a person further into tech school or a prior service because the trainee has nothing to provide the military and it's easier to separate than to keep in and possible have to pay for a bunch of medical treatments.  I've seen it before.  A trainee gets separated for the same thing that a prior service member developed while in and yet the prior service member stays in.  The difference is that the prior service has already been trained and money has been spent on them over the course of a few years.  I don't agree with it, and it fucks people over and makes them bitter towards the military, it's just unfortunately the way it is. It's a big reason I'm glad I no longer work at Reid clinic.  I hated watching trainees get told they were being separated basically because the government said they don't want to pay for their treatments."

For instance, take a look at the back of the current EPR and compare it with what's actually been given out.

I don't even want to know or think about it.  But in all seriousness though this is my biggest concern. Some units really get too wrapped around college being the ONLY thing for self improvement; even though AFSC classes could in some cases be a better investment.   I've seen it before where if/when you did a training in your AFSC no one cares but you took three classes? promote now!

AirForce,3drv4c,SilverHawk7,9,Sun Jul 19 15:05:42 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things the Air Force can ""technically"" do.  For instance, you can get an NJP for being 5 minutes late for the first time.  You can be given an LOR for being 1 minute late to being 15 minutes early (net 14 minutes early). The question is whether it will actually happen, whether the Air Force will actually pursue that technicality.    If someone's supervisor wants to pursue a referral EPR for not getting enough self improvement, they're going to have to justify it to the chain, especially if the person is a high-level performer.  The chain should (hopefully) be asking some tough questions when they see it."

Those who do 14 hour shifts 6 days a week are at a disadvantage, and shitty supervision might get affected in a negative way by this. I hate the whole airman concept. I believe in volunteering: giving back to the community feels great, but it shouldn't be a requirement. That's the opposite the definition of volunteer. School and personal development is something you have to want to do. Some people join because they don't want to go to college, they want to do a good job and serve our great country.

They will of course look at primary duties but the additional stuff, school, PME, volunteering will be the deciding factor (all other things equal)...unless you rained some hell on insurgents or directly contributed.  Whole Airmen concept is super real. You can be the best asskicker at your job, but if you don't have those 2 bullets to throw in the WAC block, I guess you risk a referral.

AirForce,3drkbq,Wherearemylegs,5,Mon Jul 20 00:12:33 2015 UTC,"So, the answer to the OPs posit isn't exactly clear.  What flies at a MAJCOM based unit, vs an AETC unit, vs a place like Korea, entirely depends on what the base policy is that drives it. I got drunk all the time with my Airmen in Osan as TSgt, didn't hang out with anyone except fellow instructors in AETC, and had a mix of one up/one down as a SSgt off-duty an operational base (Langley).   In a small or isolated unit, you're kind of limited on people you can hang out with, so lines can be blurred a bit as long as the understanding is that work is work, and off-duty is play time within certain boundaries. Now, the opposite of that is in a place like AETC. You'd better not pick up an airman with a flat tire in the rain,  or even be in the same room without another nco present when dealing with a member of the opposite sex and subordinate rank passed 2012. Then you have ops units where some shenanigans go on off-duty, but usually an unwritten understanding of lines both on/off duty, becasue you're a human and you CAN actually be friends with coworkers outside of work.   My 2 cents. If you're going to make an event, make it known to all, and invite the takers. Keep it professional, or at least confined to the tier that's most concerned. Amn with Amn, Jr NCOs with Jr NCOs, etc. Establish a line among your peers, and follow it. Don't get shit wasted in front of your Amn and compromise your authority as an NCO, etc while off duty. The occasional beer down town in a group is fine. Individually say A1C's hanging with TSgts, is not. As enlisted, just avoid hanging out with Officers altogether save formal unit functions altogether.  And never, EVER, fuck anyone in your shop or on your shift in your unit. It always breeds drama, and can frost over a workplace faster than an ice queen's nethers. Nobody needs to deal with the awkwardness of relationship drama or potential divorce."

AirForce,3dqyk7,notmyrealname86,5,Sat Jul 18 19:46:02 2015 UTC,"What school are you getting/did you get your graduate degree from?   I obtained my MS in Information Security and Assurance through Western Governors University.  Not only do you get a masters thru this program, but you will also receive EC-Council certs (Certified Ethical Hacker and Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator).  Based on your degree considerations, this may be more your speed.   What motivated you to choose that school?   WGU's programs are considered unorthodox in that it is completely self-paced, but it's great for self-starters.  My degree plan was projected for 2 years and I completed it in 9 months because I had a lot of time on my hands and my undergrad was in Infosec, so I was familiar with some of the material.   Did you need to do anything other than complete your Undergrad prior to applying (i.e. take additional prereqs)?  How far in advance did you apply?   The admission process isn't rigorous, but they do have some prerequisites before you can be considered for admission.  My admissions counselor told me that you need some sort of IT background and/or a certification like Sec+ to be admitted.  No GRE/GMAT required.  There's no specified timeline for completion/registration, all you need to do is apply and get in contact with their admissions office.   How did you pay for tuition/books?   Books are free, but tuition payments were tricky.  You pay per term, not per class.  WGU terms are 6 months long; you have three courses to complete within that timeframe, so if you can finish a course a few weeks early, you can accelerate your progression and complete more courses.  The inverse is the same; if you slack off, your advisor will bitch at you, and you waste money in the process.  This poses issues with having to pay out of pocket, since TA will only cover $250 per credit hour.  I applied for FAFSA, but couldn't get any grants, so I tapped into my GI bill to offset the remaining cost (only used up 2 months).   How has getting your Graduate degree helped you?  Was it all worth it?   As a SSgt with 9 years, not much professionally to be honest (other than bullets to pad an EPR/1206).  The knowledge they provide is geared for someone that runs IT security for a corporation, and my current position does not have that kind of oversight or responsibility lol.  I know that I wanted my masters early so I didn't have to worry about it in the future when I may have more responsibilities (my wife and I don't have kids yet) and as a junior NCO I have more white space to be productive with school.  I also wanted a school that wouldn't be outrageous in tuition costs, and in perspective, I was able to obtain a masters for approximately 7 grand including TA offsetting the cost (which is dirt cheap for a masters).  I also didn't want to pick a degree mill that would be considered questionable.  Granted, online schooling in general has certain stigmas in some circles, but honestly the name of your school means jack shit unless you're a doctor/lawyer/engineer, and most hiring agencies don't see online degrees as inferior (indicative of why so many top colleges are starting to offer online courses).  A masters is either a prerequisite for higher level management positions, a bargaining chip for a higher salary, or just a bullet on your resume to get past HR for an initial interview, and that interview will truly indicate whether or not you know your shit.  But again, this depends on your field, so YMMV.  Was it worth it?  Absolutely.  Info/Net Sec is such an in-depth field that you can't be a jack-of-all-trades, you kinda have to pick the specialty you want.  For me, I wanted the knowledge to run a company's IT Security as a CIO/CISO, which means drafting and enforcing policies to secure your company's network assets and improving its defensive posture.  WGU's ISA curriculum was perfect for that.  Link is below if you want a closer look at the program, but feel free to hit me up if you have any questions.   http://www.wgu.edu/online_it_degrees/information_security_assurance_degree   tl;dr I wanted an MS on the cheap, but didn't want to go to a degree mill.  I wanted a focus on infosec and this degree came with certs, choice was a no-brainer.  If you're self-motivated, go to WGU.  You won't regret it."

AirForce,3dqyk7,Artfullyours,3,Sun Jul 19 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"What's your rank/time in? I've been preparing to go guard so talking to a lot of the ISSOs and Security Managers at my office (most prior military) about this exact thing. They all warned about being ""overqualified"" with a Masters without having the experience to back it up. One told me that a retired Comm Major was applying for a Security Officer position, and had to start over as a level-1 sec manager. The Major was fine to start over from scratch, but I'm graduating next month with my BS in IT Security myself and would hate to do that.   They all told me to start with certifications like ISC2's SSCP or even a CEH cert first.   Think about it like showing progression in the Air Force- just like you don't go from 3 to 9 level, you don't want to just jump from a BS and go straight to a masters- show that you applied the knowledge somehow first."
AirForce,3dqyk7,Artfullyours,2,Sat Jul 18 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, I've been looking at the guard too for a little bit of stability for my children. The thing is that I really enjoy being Active Duty, so I think I'll stay until my services are no longer required.  Thanks for the feedback, that's good advice! I am an SSgt with 7 years. I had never even considered the ""overqualified"" stigma and I'll definitely have to keep that in mind. I've got 2 years experience as an ASM and I am currently trying (read: desperately hoping) for one of the 100 1B4X1 retraining positions on the online advisory (June DEROS). I know these things don't translate exactly, but I am doing my best to gain experience as I have a strong interest in the field. My hope is that I'll be too busy with going to Tech School/UGT/PME during 2016-2017 and I'm just gathering info now to give myself plenty of time to plan/execute after things settle down.  I know these aren't huge certs, but I have A+ certification and I've got my Sec+ voucher in hand. I am waiting until this semester ends so that I can take the test during the break before Fall classes start up. I fully expect to be taking courses/certs/refreshers throughout my life, in fact I consider it a benefit of joining a field in which things are always changing.  I know this all seems far off, but I enjoy making long-range plans. It's one of my core characteristics. I knew that I wanted to do the Security Manager position back when I learned about it as an A1C. I got the info I needed, did what I had to, and honed my patience in order to make myself competitive; I am kind of doing the same thing here.  Thanks again and best of luck to you!"

The major problem though is that it's for-profit and nationally accredited.  They've been working on a regional accreditation but hadn't gotten it by the time I graduated. The result is that if the other schools will not like your degree, so you'll be very limited.  Rumor has it employers won't like it either, but I've been told this doesn't necessarily hold true."

AirForce,3dqyk7,CaptianMerica,0,Mon Jul 20 00:03:25 2015 UTC,"I am working on my Masters of Reverse Logistics at AMU.  I completed my Bachelors in Logistics Management and wanted to pursue the next level.  I am looking to get out in 2018 and I want to make sure I have done everything in my power to make sure my transition is painless.   I applied shortly after my official graduation back in February.  I contacted the admissions and they told me that as soon as it passed my grad date, they would update my profile. I am paying for tuition using a combination of GI Bill and TA.  I still have to pay out of pocket for TA. Getting the grad degree, or working towards it has not helped me in the military.  For my linked-In profile it has enabled me to see another aspect of a supply chain that is becoming more and more popular, especially as companies continue to push for more trade-ins and product upgrades.  I was definitely worried over the choice of school, but I have been linking up with directors and managers from various logistics companies that have APUS degrees.   As far as the classes so far, I'm not 100% sure what I think about them so far.  I'm on my second class, Reverse Logistics Management RLMT500.  The book is composed of chapters pulled from various  Wiley published books and arranged by the class weeks.  The book itself is set up more akin to a PDG for supply chain management, but goes into detail on project management and green logistics.     The forums and papers do not always line up.  This week's forum was about Quantitative Risk Management while the paper is about Carbon Credits and evaluating a company's ecological footprint.  The reading for this week had nothing on risk management and I had to do some research on my own to answer the forum (I ended up just talking about CRM and an instance where we had a piss poor CRM day that rubbed metal, while citing the CRM AFI as my reference).  One of the ""required readings"" for the class was a 100 page PDF file that is no longer available as the old site is closed down.  When I talked to the professor about it he basically told me I was on my own, which pissed me off. My first class was pretty good and went into detail on doing a graduate level research paper.  I thought I had to do the research class first, when it turns out it could be done at any time (525 level).  The instructor is pretty cool and ended up being the first one I ever had that used videos to introduce himself and talk about each week's lesson.  I actually got to meet him when I went down to MD for my commencement.  He remembered me pretty good as he had butchered my final paper 2 weeks prior. Completing my Bachelors waived the exam and most of the fee (normal fee 350, I paid 125) for the Professional Designation in Logistics and Supply Chain (PLS) certification from the American Society of Transportation and Logistics.  The PLS is their mid-tier cert.  The AFCOOL program could be used for the basic tier cert (Global Logistics Associate), but I have a plan for the AFCOOL use.   I'll know in time whether or not it was all worth it.  I have been doing a lot of heavy reading from other books in addition to these classes.  I turned one of my guest rooms into a home office recently (still needs fixing up, 4 out of 5 outlets are not working) and got a bookshelf.  At night, once my daughter goes to bed, I go downstairs and do homework/reading/Course15 for a few hours.  I've been building up a wish list of used books on Amazon for my family to use for future gifts.  I do expect there to be some stigma against me for going to an online college, but I'm going to be banking on building contacts and having a library I can always reference back at.  (I'm kind of aiming for something along the lines of the ""here in my garage, with my car in Hollywood Hills"" guy's bookshelf set up. As far as other options I'm going to use for the future.  This year I want to get the MOS (Microsoft Office Specialist) certification as a lot of the jobs I look at want someone with Excel and Access experience.  Next year I'm going to get the APICS CSCP as the USAF will pay for it under their AFCOOL program.  I would also like to get some of the Life Cycle Logistics certifications from the Defense Acquisition University as those are free for military  members. Thanks to the guy who talked about the ACP program, I'm going to be meeting (hopefully) a logistics/Supply Chain/Operations manager in the near future.  I'm hoping through that one year mentorship, I can build some practical experience and get more networking contacts.   That is pretty much it for now.  As I said, I want to make sure I use all available benefits and options that will enable a smooth transition come Feb 2018.  If anyone knows of any other programs like the ACP, or even certification programs that are essentially free for vets/active duty military members, post them here.  In time, I'll compile a report on linked-in and post it here for others to share and use."

I go with UMUC because IMO AMU sucks. If you go through UMUC you have your highschool send your transcript to them. Then you take placement tests for writing and math. Then you start taking classes. You pay for books but some classes don't require books. Also look into FAFSA because you can get good grants from them.

Even as an NCIOC of a 2 deep shop, or as major Sq or Grp program manager with that as your primary duty, you really have to capture the scope and span of your position. Not all boards are the same from year to year for Senior, and only the people who scored them this year new where the emphasis was placed. If you want more responsibility, find a way to get it or show the importance of your role and why it's a key position.   People who have more bullets that start with ""led, organized, spearheaded"" show more leadership than someone who ""aided, assisted, participated.""   The expectation of a MSgt is someone who can manage and lead effective teams. Looking at my career field this year, most of the people that made a cutoff board score (345 range) were fast burners. Looking at the names and what I remember about those guys was that they were go-getters, and that likely reflected well in their records. We had a shit ton make it 1st or 2nd time testing since the majority of our line numbers were in the 4 and 5k range.   If you have a decent chief or someone who has sat on one of these boards, ask if they can grade your last 10 for you. Just because yours wasn't great this year, doesn't mean it couldn't improve next year, depending where the weight of effort happens to be. One year for Senior, my old boss was passed over because it seemed like all the people with the advanced degrees got selected. The next is seemed to be any SNCO who deployed recently. He deployed a lot, and was picked up that cycle with a full 45 pt difference from his previous year in addition to some award in one more rating period. Bottom line, who really knows.   But as someone who really wants to be a SNCO, what have you done to earn it? The fact is there are a ton of E-7s who didn't do shit to earn theirs, except sit around long enough under the old system and study just hard enough under the old system to make it. I'm sure if those current E-7s were boarded again this year based on their records, many of them would suck. The board process is an attempt to fix that. Hopefully, with some tweaks and some time, it will.   Edit: added more tl;dr words because I'm grilling and drinking"

I'm not saying brown nose your way into a position, but you should be projecting yourself ahead of your peers.  Simple things as Emceeing promotion/awards ceremonies may open doors for you that normally were not.    I PCS'd into a Tech Deep shop less than a year ago.  The NCOIC was retiring and the A-NCOIC spot was opening up.  I stepped up, did the things that my peers weren't and I found myself in the A-NCOIC spot ahead of more tenured guys.  Granted, most of them lack the motivation and aren't self-starters, but I got there because of my initial effort.  Things like putting out (effort) at PT, showing up to Sq functions, ALS/NCOA Grads and making a name for yourself are key.  You are a commodity and you should be making your name well known."
AirForce,3drus8,Fire_At_Night,4,Sun Jul 19 08:22:34 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate to say it, I agree with this portion. A few years back I was NCORP'd, forcd into a new career field to fulfill the rest of my enlistment, and hated life for a year until I got acclimated.  I excelled at m new job. I had two kick ass career flight chiefs to coach me, help mentor my ratees, and push them towards recognition where their strengths were to include BTZ, Gp awards for quarterlies and annuals. Those airmen I supervised are now testing for TSgt while I'm a MSgt select. There is so much a kickass mentor can impart on a new airman, through both positive and negative actions.   There is no better feeling than watching someone you supervised get recognized for their hard work, even if you were the one who wrote the 1206. Watching people grow from the airman to nco tier is why I stay in, as crazy as it sounds. The day to day interaction, and how they apply YOUR experience is really rewarding to me for some reason.  I'm 14 for 27 BTZ package wise. I have had 7 airmen, and 5 NCOs nail annual level awards at the Group or higher. I don't like blowing myself, but damn, some of my people are really outstanding guys/gals are so capable and talented, they deserved the recognition.   Look, downvote if you must, but you're working with some amazing people that will surpass you at the TSgt level everyday even as A1Cs with their drive and motivation. If you're people are hot shit, learn how to recognize their effort in your unit, and put them in for awards dammit. There are a ton out there. They may be difficult to write at first, but you get better with experience doing it.   The AF isn't about awards and checking boxes, but you know an airmen or shit hot SSgt when you see one. Do them a favor and help recognize how crucial they are to whatever your units mission is.  It's not about just checking boxes, but if someone really enjoys there work at the involvement level, do whatever you can to look out for them.

I wrote every specific mission detail offline as an e-4, and my supervisors defined it better. As a staff I was specific with my airmen to seek out certain opportunities, and quantify numbers and metrics for them, with my MSgt reframing them in a better format. As I tsgt I was advising my staffs of key opportunities for themselves and their airmen, and rewriting what needed to be stronger for the impacts on their eprs or on the occasional 1206.   What it boiled down too, was keeping track of my shit and what unit or wing, or who my actions and results impacted. I also sought out advice on why what I or my troops were doing in terms of significance. I asked lots of questions, and my SNCOs mentored the shit out of me one on one for what the wing or unit felt was important.   I don't like claiming other peoples hard work. It just feels dirty. But emphasizing what you have done to help others really did help me for this selection board, because I found how important mentorship was.   I'm not talking about organizing a sq briefing on EES changes from the 5/6 circlejerk or box checking. What helped me was the earnest effort of speaking before people as a total introvert on behalf of those issues, and capturing why they were important to me. I developed a few passions that were really true for me, and ID'd similar passions in my troops to develop and branch on for their own to teach other people.   I felt I got shafted as a cross trainee a few years ago, and was placed in a smaller back shop in terms of responsibility. Luckily, my flight chief emphasized how important my job was in terms a rooms the sq, and the group and why certain metrics and numbers were important. Find that SNCO who can show what you do is great, and thr span you influenced. That really helped me. If my immediate supe sucked I found someone like then who was successful, and passed their BS along to my airmen for advice, while trying to make myself a bit better at framing my direct role in that.   Don't lose hope man. This first board was brutal across many afscs. Master isn't unachievable, but be damn sure you capture the scope of how important your job is to make sure your unit runs smoothly via the number or personnel you affect, the group as a whole, and wing projects  that get tasked."

Tried repairing archive using Control Panel, then a fresh install of Chrome. Pics still not loading. Restarted computer, can't see pics yet. I don't know what could be wrong. I'll try to get a good night's sleep and work it out tomorrow.  Day 2: Woke up refreshed and ready to tackle the pic issue again. This time, I decided to wipe my hard drive and reinstall Windows 7 from scratch. Didn't solve the problem, pics still not showing up. Bought new Motherboard/Hard Drive off Newegg, expecting delivery soon  Day 5: Installed new Motherboard/Hard Drive, still can't see pictures. Maybe it's a network issue. I'll try contacting customer support and getting them to send a technician over.  Day 10: Technician came over, he was just as baffled as I was at my problem. The strangest thing was that he couldn't seem to find any problem with my router/jack. He told me that the problem was beyond his expertise, apologizing profusely as he did so. He then left, head hung low and shoulders slumped in a visible display of shame and personal disappointment. Still can't see pictures.  Day 47: Rerouted all my house's electrical power to modem, set Memory Usage priority for Google Chrome to High. Pictures still not loading. My friends and neighbors are becoming concerned with what they call my ""pathological behavior"". They have made numerous attempts to coax me out of my bedroom, all to no avail. I will not leave until I find a solution to this conundrum. My will shall not be broken.  Day 83: The outside world now seems like a far-off memory. Does it even exist, I wonder? Could it merely have been some manic confabulation crafted by a mind trapped in the quagmire of desperation? I cannot conjecture. My food supplies run increasingly thin.

Because of my bad choices I had a credit score in the low 500s. Since being in the Air Force I have saved over 30k and I have brought my credit score up to 782. I use my black star card for everything. Since I am over seas in Japan most of my gas and grocery purchases are made on base. The discount I get on gas is a good reason to have the star card. I pay off my credit card as soon as it posts online. I also do something called pay my self first. Every paycheck I take a set amount from my check and place it into 2 savings accounts. One savings account is my life savings and the other is what I call my ""fun savings"" my fun savings is what I use to pay off larger purchases. Like Xboxs or rainy day fund type stuff. I don't budget I just don't let my check go below 2k. I just make art purchases and know when I can't go any further. Also I take life savings and place them in long term CDs(commanding interest is your friend).  That is how I have have built my credit. I recommend that you also build make a fun savings and get one item at a time and pay it in full. Credit cards can get away from you and can seem like a impossible hole to dig your self out of with all the out of control interest."

AirForce,3dq9ro,MrFoolinaround,13,Sat Jul 18 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"Military Star cards are awful. Get one through any other bank, though personally, I'd stay away from Bank of America too. Their business practices from when I used them ensured I never would again.    Some financial advice though: It's better to save up and buy these things than to use credit. That being said, I doubt you have $1000 lying around if you are going to use a credit card for it. So here's what I would do: 1) Get the star card for that nice 10% off your first day of purchases and buy everything at once. 2) Take out another credit card with a better rate, and transfer the balance. (Pay off your star card with the lower interest rate card) 3) Make more than your minimum payment on your credit card to pay it off quickly. 4) Use your credit card for emergencies only and build a savings account so you can buy these things in the future without a credit card.  (Also since you now have your sweet entertainment system, you should be saving money on your other entertainment sources) 5) Build yourself a budget. Know how much you are going to get paid, and make sure you know how much each month you will need for food, cabs, cell phone, bills, etc so that you don't overspend somewhere else.    If you can do these things, then you are on your way to being financially independent and not living paycheck to paycheck. Checkout r/personalfinance for money management tips.    True story, I knew a SrA with ~$30,000 saved up in the bank because he knew what he was doing with his money. Be that guy, you'll enjoy life.    PLEASE REMEMBER: If you get the Star card that is connected to Chase bank so you can use it outside of just the BX, THEY ARE TWO SEPARATE BALANCES. You will have a Star card balance AND a Chase card balance and you have to pay them both separately in different places. A lot of people have killed their credit score because they didn't know this"
AirForce,3dq9ro,MarauderBronze,3,Sat Jul 18 12:41:11 2015 UTC,"Do the math on the ""load up Star card, transfer balance,"" plan. A lot of cards will charge you 3% to transfer, and if there's an introductory  or ""teaser"" interest rate it could be surprising when they bump that up to the true rate.  An annual fee on a new card also factors in... pay attention to that.  Two new cards at one time = hit on the ol' credit score. Another thing to consider.  Also, when they ask at the BX food court if you want to save 10% on lunch with your Star card, just say no. It's doing crap like that over time gets people into trouble. If you have to charge your lunch thinking saving sixty cents is a great deal, maybe you should brown bag it."
AirForce,3dq9ro,crankyrhino,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:03:41 2015 UTC,"Good points on the transferring balance. I didn't think of that.    Also the hit on the credit score will be there, but will go away quickly if the cards are paid on time, but it is something to think about."

It's too crappy with too much hassle.    If you miss a payment on a regular card you can explain the situation and maybe pay a ten dollar late fee.  Miss a star card payment? Get ready to see the 1st Sgt.  It's not worth it."
AirForce,3dq9ro,MarauderBronze,2,Sat Jul 18 13:10:37 2015 UTC,"Oh damn. I figured the Star Card would be one of the ""dummy proof"" type cards or something. Like it would automatically be taken off the next check with a late fee or something. Really glad I slept on my decision and then decided to ask here first instead if just doing it."
AirForce,3dq9ro,Apollo821,2,Sat Jul 18 13:19:42 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but at the same time, you need to figure it out or else you won't get to where you want to be financially. It sucks, but don't give up. It takes time, I had to figure it all out myself too, my parents left my financial education lacking. I'd be in a much better place financially if I had done the research and not figured out everything by mistake.  Do research, like I said r/personalfinance is a good place to start.    As far as transferring, it should be as easy as either: 1) Paying your 1st credit card balance off using the 2nd credit card. Just use it as your bill payment method. OR 2) Some banks have the service where if you give them the information, they will transfer the balance for you to the new card because they want your business. However this process varies by bank."
AirForce,3dq9ro,timbobarry,3,Sat Jul 18 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"Any credit card company that asks who your 1st Sgt and CC are is not your friend.   I'd look into USAA, Chase, and American Express. As much as I don't want to support an AF club, my Chase Club Card isn't bad at all.   I know AMEX waives their fees for military, but you have to call up and ask for it as there's no option for that online."

I don't have a running balance on it and I just use it for the cash back rewards. In fact, I have multiple credit cards that are used depending on the place I'm at. Amazon gives 3% back on their site and 2% on gas/food/pharmacies. USAF Services card is used for any non AAFES controlled organization on base to 2% back. Then the Star Card is used for any AAFES ran place. I charge everything to cards for the cash back rewards including bills. I then pay them off every Friday. Those cash rewards add up. At the very least, most cash rewards cards give 1% back."

AirForce,3dq9ro,genehil,2,Sat Jul 18 13:40:53 2015 UTC,"Well first off, I'm not old enough to drink; so, bars are out of the question. Secondly, I fully intend to explore Korea. I'm here for a year, I don't want to sit in my dorm all the time and play xbox. These are short-term purchases and items I would like to have also for the long-term. I hate sitting in my room and doing nothing, so I'd like to have the extra entertainment for the times where I don't feel like going out and drinking when of age or if I'm stuck in my room due to it flooding outside or being too damn cold to do anything."

I did the math the other day and if I used it every time I filled up I would've saved over $300 the last 3 years. Then again I'm always doing road trips on weekends.

AirForce,3dq9ro,Fr0gFsh,2,Sat Jul 18 20:12:42 2015 UTC,A TSgt friend of mine is super against Mil star. He got a bunch of money back on his taxes and paid off about 10x the normal minimum payment. Mil Star then upped his min payment to that 10x the next month. He called them up asking why they had increased his minimum payment since he had never missed a payment and they said that him paying a large sum made it look like he wants to pay it off. So they're gonna help out. He and his family had to live by a very tight budget that month and he quickly paid off and canceled the card.
AirForce,3dq9ro,agile52,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:47:03 2015 UTC,Sounds like there is more to the story.  I've done that a couple times with larger purchases and it's reduced my minimum payment.
AirForce,3dq9ro,Twisky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:27:41 2015 UTC,"1st purchase with military star card is 10% off, so that's about the only incentive.   Spend your 1k, get the 10%, and immediately pay the full balance so you don't incur interest. (In other words, have the money saved up before you make the purchase!)  I did that with my star card. I no longer use it. I do use the Amazon card now (which is Chase) and earn points. There are lots of cards that offer points and we use it to our advantage. We buy everything on our credit card and pay it off every 2 weeks when we get paid. Never paid a penny in interest, and I just cashed out my points for over $800.  Make the credit card company pay you! Work their system and don't fall into a debt trap."

It was always a means to an end, and since I was just a young Airman I had no idea wtf was going on. I've never considered my time as valuable, and I never minded volunteering. I just always assumed it was one of those things that happens in the military.   I'm not saying I condone voluntelling people for stuff, but it is something I kind of expect from leadership.

AirForce,3dnzad,Beardedcap,4,Fri Jul 17 20:56:38 2015 UTC,300MPH cruise speed is pretty damn fast. The Osprey isn't held back like conventional helicopters. They don't have to worry about retreating blade stalls.   For those that don't know what that is:  Blades on a helicopter spin to generate lift like wings on a plane. The issue arises when the aircraft starts flying forward. As the object moves forward the blades still rotate. One blade will be moving forward in the direction of travel but the opposite blade will be moving backwards (retreating). You can then move forward at the same speed the rotor rotates and this essentially doubles the lift of the one blade going in the direction of travel but negates the speed of the retreating blade. Now you have one blade providing double the lift and the retreating blade producing 0 lift which is a stall. Retreating blade stall.  This is why there are max speed limits on helicopters. Since the Osprey converts to a conventional plane that doesn't matter anymore.
AirForce,3dnzad,FunktasticLucky,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"I was just saying compared to a conventional aircraft it isn't that fast.  Due to it being a turboprop.  Propellers are inefficient when turning any faster than the speed of sound, normally that limits the speed of propeller driven aircraft.  Wasn't trying to start a technical discussion"
AirForce,3dnzad,Beardedcap,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:32:40 2015 UTC,Why typically props don't spin faster than the speed of sound (the tips can actually spin faster than the speed of sound) that's still pretty fast. But osprey's can go where helicopters can without worry of striking a tail rotor or the rotor (the props are typically higher).   You can't compare them to conventional aircraft. You have to compare them to rotorcraft because that's what they were made to replace. Transport helicopters.
AirForce,3dnzad,FunktasticLucky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:46:23 2015 UTC,Dat explanation tho. Thanks. Pretty cool stuff!
AirForce,3dnzad,parabolic_depression,2,Sat Jul 18 13:46:59 2015 UTC,"Rotor craft are interesting actually. You have to think of the rotor as a gyroscope. It's essentially a spinning disc. This has fun physics stuff on its on. Example:  Did you know that when you apply a force to a gyroscope the force doesn't happen until 90 degrees out of phase. It's awesome as hell. Basically you want the helicopter to tilt forward to begin moving forward. You would think you want to the rotor to be in line with the body of the helicopter and have the back rotor blade pitch to provide more lift while the front blade pitches to provide less lift causing the helicopter to tilt forward and move. Unfortunately, due to what is known as gyroscopic precession this isn't the case. That force would not actually be applied until 90 degrees of rotation later which would actually cause the helicopter to roll to the side instead of pitch forward.   You know what... This explains it much better and you can see it for your own eyes. It's pretty awesome. I love physics because it explains stuff like this and blows my mind."
AirForce,3dnzad,FunktasticLucky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:08:39 2015 UTC,"I know you really tried to explain this fascinating mystery of physics, but any layman should understand the tangential force for a rotating body. It doesn't need to be obfuscated with technical jargon."

It's meant to ALLOW your provider to tell the insurance company what you've been treated for so they can get paid, by extending confidentiality rules to insurers, medical billing companies, and the like.   Example: Your doctor treats you for herpes and wants to get paid. Before HIPAA, your doc couldn't tell the insurance company what she'd treated you for without worrying that the insurance company would violate your confidentiality. Before HIPAA, a potential boss could call Tricare and say, ""I want to hire this person, are they sick?"" and nothing prevented Tricare from telling them you had herpes... They aren't your doctor, after all, and didn't promise you confidentiality. HIPAA changed that.  Everyone treats it like it's some big bad ""you can't talk about people's medical condition"" but it's not. Yes, there's confidentiality, but it's not HIPAA."

Of course this is if the 469 was for longer than 30 days which most are these days it seems.  5.2.2.3. The expiration date on the AF Form 469 represents the date the member is medically cleared to resume physical activities previously restricted. For DLCs of 30 days or less, members are eligible to complete a FA when their AF Form 469 restrictions expire, and will be tested within 30 days, if due or overdue. For DLCs lasting greater than 31 days, members will be eligible to complete the full, four component FA 42 days after the expiration date of physical limitations, as annotated on AF Form 469. This allows time for reconditioning, if exempted for greater than 30 days. NOTE: Reference 5.2.3. for guidance regarding pregnant members.  5.2.2.4. Airmen with an AF Form 469 must maintain FA currency standards. If a member is due to test during the AF Form 469 effective dates or 42-day reconditioning period, the member will complete the FA components that he/she is cleared to test on per the AF Form 469.

AirForce,3dot76,demintheAF,2,Sat Jul 18 02:39:21 2015 UTC,Yea but he's definitely wrong.  Find out who has asims access and you can request the 422 that way. Most section chiefs or 1st sgts should have free access to it.   Seeing the duty limitations is your responsibility as a supervisor.

As others have said there is absolutely nothing on the 422 that has medical information on it. So by you seeing it, it definitely wouldn't violate HIPPA.

AirForce,3dot76,adverseaction,2,Sat Jul 18 04:04:43 2015 UTC,"It's not HIPPA to verify a profile.   As a matter of fact, you, as the supervisor should have access to his profile on ASIMS.  You are allowed to see when the profile expires and what limitations they have as the person's supervisor.  You do not have the right to know why they are on said profile.  But that doesn't seem to be the issue.  How long was he on the profile for?  If it was more than 30 days, then you have to give him time before he can test again to get back into passing standards.  I believe the refs say 45 days, but i could be off a few.  He can go to IG if he wants, but as long as you were asking him what his issues are and only asking about the restrictions and dates, he doesn't really have a case."

AirForce,3dnqqr,Rwhit,3,Sat Jul 18 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"I've been pooling the individuals around my squadron to see what I should expect when I test next year. We're an FTD detachment to give you an idea.  Both NCOIC's (only top EPR shows this duty title) supervising around 10-15~ respectively.   Each have 2 CCAF's with no Bachelor's degrees or markdowns.  No awards PME/Qtrly/Annual in their records.  Both received a board score of 352.5 meaning they received an 8, 8, and 7.5 in two different AFSC's. If my math is wrong please let me know. (2 sets of 3 different people came to the same conclusion based on these same facts)  I also know an individual that destroyed the boards with a 412 board score testing first time with ""some"" leadership duty title experience. This was due to the fact that he was rewarded for his efforts by being moved into a one deep position with no opportunity to directly supervise anyone. It appears he wasn't penalized for it.  Numerous annual/qtrly/PME (DG and Leadership) awards ranging from when he was an airman to recently. These awards went from job related BAMF awards to Airman/NCO awards to Safety awards to Sijon awards to a prof org award to just about anything you could think of.  2 ccaf's (due to cross train) and bachelor's that leads directly back to his afsc.  His leadership for his career has basically constantly said this guy does exactly what he needs to do in his technical duties, his leadership/mentorship duties, while fulfilling his whole Airman concept duties.  I've also seen a guy get a 330 that has a master's, but comparably may not have as much experience leading or have any significant achievements.   YMMV, of course, but just with this slim bit of evidence I can get kind of an idea of what they're looking for.  EDIT: Morale of the story (at least from my POV) is make sure you take care of your airmen, but also make sure at the same time you're taking care of yourself. Tech sergeants often get put in a position where they are too busy putting their people up for awards to even consider themself. I'm not saying we should consider ourselves for NCO of the qtr awards by any means, but I feel like we need to get crafty in being recognized for our efforts since from this anecdotal evidence I feel like awards carry weight. If your leadership thinks your a certified badass in every way, how do they take care of you now without taking anything away from your subordinates' hard work?"
AirForce,3dnqqr,Swamp86,2,Fri Jul 17 20:50:55 2015 UTC,Great thread! Hope to see participation...
AirForce,3dnqqr,AnalJelly,2,Fri Jul 17 21:02:06 2015 UTC,Your EPR has to show supervision with X amount supervised.  NCOIC jobs etc.   I think correct me if I'm wrong.

At my last unit, I was the lead instructor for my office of 6.  It was not an FTD, but more of an MQTP for the enroutes units in the Pacific.  I've headed numerous training and manning support TDYs to various bases in the Pacific and the states from there.  I've also been a part of various projects that affected my previous wing, with me being the lead on a few of them.  A really good supervisor and the fact that I was at wing staff helped me be a part of a lot of the things I did there."

AirForce,3dnqqr,Tsgt4life,4,Sat Jul 18 17:08:13 2015 UTC,"So I made the boards and I'm not shy...I'll share my stats.  I'm pretty much the example of what will not get you a good board score.  I had a 3 and 4 EPR that were due to a bad supervisor that I could not please, probably should have taken it to the IG.     2 CCAF's College classes on every EPR No Special Duties No referral EPRs EPR's 5,5,3,4,5,5,4,4,5,5  No UIF/unfavorable info TIS 11 years/TIG 4 years No Awards 2 Achievement medals   Board Score 300, 44 members boarded, 24 selected, 20 non-selects.  I was #20.  One person had a 292.5 board score, not sure what that person did, probably a non 5 EPR on top, I dunno.  Made Staff and Tech first time, mostly by luck.  This was my third time for Master and also I crosstrained two years ago which I'm sure hurt my board score.  I honestly never anticipated having to board for rank (figured MSgt would be it for me) so I never chased awards, even when I did award worthy stuff.  I feel a bit sad knowing it's going to be a long time until my next promotion, if ever at all.  At least I can still retire as a Tech (for now).  Don't make my mistake, start planning for that board while you're an airman.  All of my EPR's went to the board, including my very first one as an A1C."
AirForce,3dnqqr,Kedriastral,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:51:50 2015 UTC,In maintenance we saw board scores in the 390s for individuals in FTD.  No one else even got close to those scores.

AirForce,3dnqqr,longbr83,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:08:20 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the only real way to compare board scores would be to compare across a single AFSC. The Colonel and 2 chiefs from each function will norm differently and board scores will vary across the functions. Your board score might go up next year but you could be a lower standing amongst your career field eligibles. The converse is also true.
AirForce,3dnqqr,Kupiga,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:28 2015 UTC,"My board score was 352.5 (8, 8, 7.5).  Just barely below average of 358 for my career field.  Zero education. Ton of special duties: UFPM, Scheduler, Exec Assistant All 5's, but had a markdown in one section 3 years ago. 11 years TIS, 2 years TIG. No ""X-of-the-X"" awards. 1 AFCM, only decoration. No deployments, but that's the norm for my career field.  I feel like the strengths of my EPRs are in the jobs that I've held.  I know some people poo-poo on exec type positions but the amount that I learned there and was exposed to was pretty cool, and intense.  My weaknesses were probably because I have had very little amount of time actually leading airmen and my education sucks.  No CCAF, no course 15."
AirForce,3dnqqr,Rwhit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:53:17 2015 UTC,Get with a local Chief to go over your records. That score doesn't really add up to what I've been seeing from others with comparable records. I'm just a scrub trying to learn this process though.
AirForce,3dnqqr,MountainKnuckle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:54:08 2015 UTC,Did you have any markdowns or anything lower than a 5 that the board looked at?
AirForce,3dnqqr,MountainKnuckle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"That 4 isn't doing you any favors. The board looks at the records so quickly that they look for the easy discriminators. This works both ways. Anything with training airmen, leading teams or helping develop people stands out. Make it easy for them to find in your evaluation if possible. How much higher did he score than you? Anything less than a 360 would require some crazy high test scores to make it."
AirForce,3dnqqr,MountainKnuckle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:55:14 2015 UTC,The good news is that the 4 you received should drop off next year when your EPR points are totaled. Also most people will be getting a promote so overall the EPR scores will drop. If you are able to get one of the top two rankings that could help you make up the difference. Remember the only thing you can control is what goes on your EPR.
AirForce,3dnqqr,MountainKnuckle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"No they don't know what you scored on your test or what your EPR points are (although they could figure out the EPR points, but I doubt they spend the time doing that). I know people who scored in the 90s and still didn't get promoted because of a 4 or something else that they had in their records. Best advice I can give it do everything you can (within reason) to get the 'must promote' to help bridge the gap. How many points did you miss it by (if you are willing to share)?"
AirForce,3dnqqr,MountainKnuckle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:46:17 2015 UTC,"That isn't very much! I know some people that missed it by almost 100! Board scores change from year to year. If you can keep kicking ass at the test, I don't see any reason why you won't be able to make it! The worst thing to do is think you can't make it and don't put in the study time only to miss it because of low test scores."
AirForce,3dnqqr,kidneysmasher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:57:26 2015 UTC,"I've made SSgt, TSgt, and MSgt my second time. I think the board is what pushed me over the top this year for MSgt. I received a 400 on the board. 60 on the SKT and 70 on the PDG, with 20 Dec points. 3 JCOMS, 2 AFCOMS, 1 ARCOM, 1 JSAM, and 1 AFAM. I hit 12 years on 4 June. I have my CCAF, BS, and one class shy of my MBA. I have zero special duties. and have nothing but firewall fives (but who doesnt't)   I only have a couple of quarterly awards under my belt and that was when I was a SrA/SSgt. I won NCO of the Month four months in a Row, as detachment Supe (TSgt), when I was deployed to Afghanistan. So I was number 1 of 765 for the 966 AES/AEW.   I honestly believe the reason my score was higher than others was my leadership. I have only held NCOIC positions since I put on SSgt, Flt chief as a TSgt, and 3 months as acting AF Ops Supe. My chief looked at my records and was pretty close to what the board scored me.  He told me I have a lot of experiencing leading outside of my career field and in the joint arena and that looks favorably. They are looking for people that are already doing the job.   I hope that helps."
AirForce,3dnqqr,shitty_username,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:20:55 2015 UTC,I think a MSgt should already know what to tell his troops and what a board looks at. I don't really think there is going to much benefit to this sort of discussion.

AirForce,3dmanm,81292,3,Fri Jul 17 15:44:33 2015 UTC,When I was an instructor all the 341s I pulled resulted in an extended CQ shift over the weekend.  So I saved it for the jokers who were that extra special kinda dirtbag
AirForce,3dmanm,painlesspics,2,Fri Jul 17 18:44:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on the airman and the circumstance. If it's a good airman that just made a small mistake, it gets thrown out. Otherwise they get filed, and if a few of them pile up the airman gets extra duty, an LOC, or an LOR depending on what he or she got 341's pulled for. An LOR means the airman doesn't get to take RAP, which is usually pretty important to them. Extra duty isn't very popular either. They value their short time off, so that's often incentive enough not to screw up too much."

I've been minding my own business trying walk to my car and some yellow rope walks up like ""did you see me pull that 341 for that Airmen having his hands in his pockets"".

I can very easily see someone trying to be the hero and either killing/injuring more people or getting themselves killed. We get training on how to deal with active shooter scenarios, we have some protection gear to help us in a fire fight (not a lot, but more than most other people on base). It just creates a nightmare for SF on base.  I get it, we are soft targets, especially off base. Maybe change rules that you can carry weapon in your vehicle on base and must remain secured, so when you leave base you have access to it...but allowing everyone to carry on base is just asking for way more problems than it fixes."

At most bases the very second you leave the gates those same people you are afraid of are instantly allowed to carry and a lot of them do. Except off base they don't magically become a different person; they are still the exact same person that they are on base.   Your argument is a common one that really doesn't hold up to real world statistics. In the real world the vast majority of people that chose to carry are the ones who have enough interest in firearms to do it right. They are more law abiding than cops and have better success rates and lower error rates than trained guards. The reason that you see SF members who suck at shooting is because they are made to for their job and they only do it when they are forced to, anyone who makes the deliberate choice to CCW is someone who does it because they want to, that makes a huge difference and real world statistics and facts don't lie."

In most of the country law abiding citizens are allowed to carry in most settings and the country didn't turn into the ""wild west"" (which by the way had about 1/4th of our current homicide rate).

AirForce,3dnza1,jjxx101,4,Sat Jul 18 04:16:52 2015 UTC,I'm all for it. A majority of people that legally carry have somewhat of an idea what they are doing.   Secondly I'm sure there are people that already bring firearms on bases regularly.   SF would have to adapt their active shooter training to consider someone armed handling the threat. Of course pre-deployment training goes over that consideration already it would just need to be harped on at home station.

AirForce,3dlq3s,AnalJelly,3,Fri Jul 17 13:58:22 2015 UTC,I find it very difficult to come up with the right situation where it's okay for a commander to yell at another officer for a trash bin overflowing in public.  That's something you would only ever yell at an airman for because you know they deliberately avoided doing it.    First thing it's absolutely not professional.  Secondly it's not something worth getting worked up over for someone who is already a commander.  If their position is in jeopardy where a trash bin overflowing during a DV visit is going to get them sacked they have other pressing matters to worry about.

After the birth he decided to get a paternity test before he was going to ask her to marry him. Sure enough it came out that it wasn't his child. He was actually very relieved, she was devastated.

AirForce,3dn0yi,Swamp86,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:20 2015 UTC,"Fuck.   Okay so you're doing the right thing by asking for help, first of all, so good for you. What role do you want to play in your child's life? Do you want to be a parent? You're going to be on the hook for a hefty child support almost no matter what you do, so bear that in mind.  My thought is that you might consider (flamesuit on) a ""marriage of convenience"". It's limiting, and if you're stupid it can get you into trouble, but it will get you and your baby mama assigned together so you can play a full-time role in your kid's life. If the relationship is still going, then it wouldn't even be ethically questionable.   Since you appear to have just gotten to where you are, an outright voluntary PCS for an unmarried person is very unlikely, but you might discreetly check with your 1Sgt on that. Maybe see if you can get a hitch in Korea or a 365 and then follow-on where baby mama is at?   On the personal side, I hope you make the right choice and own both of your fuck-up and be a parent to your child. This is a tough situation for sure, but that's not the kid's fault, and he/she deserves to have two parents who give a damn. Don't be a deadbeat because you didn't plan for this.   Best of luck to you, and let us know how it turns out."

Yes, there are a lot of dumb 21 year olds, but I'm not sure there are more dumb 21 year olds in the military rather than out of it.   At least the ones in the military have to qualify on weapons and have had some prior exposure to them. Also, they can still own and carry them off base, so if they're dumb with firearms we already give them the chance to be dumb.

So if you're stationed in CA/NY/NJ/MA etc, no protection for you.  I doubt there are many, if any, other countries which do since so few allow CCW in the first place.    I don't think it'd solve anything.  Given that this incident occurred at a reserve center with so little security I'd classify it as none, I think the focus should be on increasing security at places like this.

I actually accept the fact that mistakes will occur, just like anyone who has a driver's license and operates a motor vehicle accepts all of the accidents and deaths that occur on a daily basis, unless someone is actually out protesting in the street that there should be less cars, restricted cars, slower speed limits, etc."
AirForce,3doecf,LeftHook05,6,Fri Jul 17 23:57:03 2015 UTC,"Perhaps we wouldn't have lost four Marine brothers today (16JUL15) if one of them had a personal weapon.   Didnt the shooter spray at the building from a distance? I don't think even if the marines had weapons it would have saved them from a surprise attack.  kinda nitpicking, but I dont think MORE weapons are the answer."
AirForce,3doecf,tips_,7,Sat Jul 18 01:06:14 2015 UTC,"It's not really nitpicking, it's actually a good argument.  The recruiters were chosen because they were vulnerable.  Even if armed they would have been killed by a surprise attack.  It's also a temporary solution.  If everyone on a base is armed, then active shooters would move to a different ""soft target"" like a school.  If all the schools get armed guards and/or concealed weapons, then churches would be next and so far and so on.  The focus should be more on prevention then reaction.  I'd be curious what the investigation find out about his motives and any indications of violence before hand."
AirForce,3doecf,snoopymondeo,3,Sat Jul 18 01:12:25 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely curious what his motives were, as well. For the sake of discussion, let's just say he was Daesh. How do we focus on preventing these kinds of attacks? As long as America exists, it will have enemies. I just don't see how we can prevent terrorists (allegedly) from terrorizing."
AirForce,3doecf,CerwinVegas55,0,Sat Jul 18 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"You are right, we will always have enemies and it will never go away, but there are ways to mitigate the number of attacks.  Imagine this scenario.  A Soldier and a Marine have an argument and get into a fight. No big deal. Now a civilian jumps the Marine and then suddenly the Soldier and Marine are on the same side and start fighting the civilian.  Same basic concept with ISIS/Taliban/ISIL/fill in the blank.  The Middle East has had internal wars for years (Shiite vs Sunni vs Kurd vs Jew).  When another entity invades, the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" takes effect and they join together to fight the invader.  As long as there is a common enemy, there is a common cause for the different factions to rally around."
AirForce,3doecf,snoopymondeo,4,Fri Jul 17 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"You emphasize MORE like it's going to create a bigger problem. I'd prefer to at least have the option to have the opportunity to have a snowballs chance in hell. Better that than shut off the lights, flip the desk, and  wait to die."
AirForce,3doecf,CerwinVegas55,2,Fri Jul 17 23:39:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of people think that ""More guns aren't the answer"". Have you logically thought it through though?  What did the navy yard shooting and the attack in TX all have in common? Not a single victim could fight back. If there was a single, just 1 individual, that could fire back things may have gone differently."
AirForce,3doecf,thulfs,0,Sat Jul 18 00:07:49 2015 UTC,So I think the problem with more guns is that with an active shooter on base and lots of other armed people who have no idea who the dangerous active shooter is may lead to more chaos.

Chances are you less either expose yourself and get killed or maintain proper cover and miss quite a few times. Those misses have the chance to kill others.  Then you have the situation where there is one shooter and multiple ""defenders"". Confusion and in the moment you might not know who is who and end up shooting someone one your side.  You very well might be the hero of the day or you might end up being responsible for the death of others.   I believe the military prefers to have their own SF personnel respond because they control what training they get."

It is absolutely NOT saying that any old Joe Snuffy can carry a weapon on base.  CHL holders are by their very nature conscientious, responsible, and safe gun owners. CHL holders know the law because they have to. CHL holders are not cowboys hoping to get into a gunfight.  It is ironic that I consider myself less safe the moment I step on post because I lose the ability to arm myself when I leave state land. Military bases are targets and no amount of security will prevent mass shootings or terrorist attacks. The only course of action at this point is casualty mitigation. I remember General Milley bragging about the response time of the military police and contracted security during the last Fort Hood shooting (I was there). He claimed that security was on scene in about 10 minutes. I was infuriated when he said this because three people were still murdered in this ""short"" amount of time."

As I stated in another thread, an Armed Force base with no Arms is like a strip club with no poles.  With this, I think it would be wise to implement a system which would require gun owners to have a certain amount of training and/or hours spent shooting before being allowed to carry on base. The problem is not more or less guns, the problem is proper training and responsibility - and having the means to put an end to an emergency situation."

AirForce,3dl2t1,bluetrol,3,Fri Jul 17 12:57:12 2015 UTC,"The nicest thing I found about enlisting for 6 years was experiencing two duty stations. The first one is whatever because you're new. But if you're at 4, you might have to re-enlist to pull off a second, and if you get sent to some shithole and never really intended to re-enlist anyway, you know you won't have to suck it up for a full 4. My first assignment was to Aviano. My second was to Fort Fucking Polk, Louisiana. That was the nail in the coffin that made me nope out of there. I couldn't imagine a full enlistment in that place."

AirForce,3dlmv7,twelveparsex,8,Fri Jul 17 07:14:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I can only speak from senior board experience, but the gist should be the same.  First off, no one really knows what influences board scores.  I've heard so many different things from other seniors and chiefs, so take everything with a grain of salt.  So here are the major categories of influence that you will generally hear about: 1)  Awards.  No denying this one.  Have lots of awards, and if they are at the wing level or higher, so much the better.  Everyone has a stack of 5 EPRs.  Not everyone has awards. 2)  Medals.  I don't mean PCS or mid-tour.  Deployment medals, specific achievement medals, etc...  If you PCS'd and didn't get a medal, that might cost you a little, but having those specific achievements helps a lot.  I'd place more value on my achievements than my MSMs come board time. 3)  CCAF/PME.  Really matters for senior.  I heard that this was masked from the boards for MSgt.  If you've got them, great, but hopefully they are captured in a bullet on an EPR because if they aren't on the DVB due to being masked the board won't see them.  Education beyond CCAF is good too, especially if it is a degree that relates to your AFSC.    Adding a PMC didn't do shit for my board. 4)  Strats.  I made senior 2nd try without one.  Not having one isn't bad, but having one helps.  This is a fact that sucks and it shouldn't be this way, but having an awesome PT score can go along way towards a strat.  Bullshit, but so is the game.  Wing level volunteer stuff is good too for this. 5)  Breadth of experience.  Basically a special duty or something, working in QA, wing safety, etc...  Again, not bad if you don't have some of these, good if you do.  Personally I never did any of that stuff. 6)  Highest position held/duty title.  If you've held duty titles that are typically held by people of the rank your shooting for, good for you.  This helps.  Level of responsibility comes into play as well.  A section chief who supervises 120 people will fare better than a section chief who supervises 15. 7)   Professional Organizations.  I hate to even include this.  I hate the top 3/AFA/AFSA and all that bullshit.  I've never been to a top three meeting except once when my boss drug me to one.  Not necessary, but probably won't hurt. 8)  Intraservice PME.  If you can score it, go for it.  I did Marine SNCOA.  Great eye opening experience and it is the kind of thing that sets you apart.    Now the hard part.  Do all this and achieve a good score without being a self absorbed, kool-aid drinking douchebag.  Or be a heavy crew chief.  We've got great promotion rates."
AirForce,3dlmv7,Dimsdale53,2,Fri Jul 17 08:05:39 2015 UTC,"Good post, I would add the biggest factor of those is consistency from year to year.  The board will look for those things each year, gaps will pose questions.  You don't have to be super awesome each year (it helps) but just be good each year (try to do a little more each year) and that will help build your board score."
AirForce,3dlmv7,Niirs,2,Fri Jul 17 09:23:33 2015 UTC,"Well that would explain it.  I'm probably the only TSgt in the Air Force with just an achievement medal despite deploying 6 times.  How do they know what awards you've won?  Is it just based on EPR bullets?  Secondly, I feel cheated not just because of my CCAF  situation but people I outrank have been selected to attend PME courses ahead of me since they have more time in service than I do which garners them more points simply by time in service.   Basically you have to be hitting the kool-aid pretty hard to make E-7 now...got it."
AirForce,3dlmv7,Dimsdale53,5,Fri Jul 17 08:24:19 2015 UTC,Generally the only way the board would see awards is if it were a bullet on an epr.  Drinking the kool-aid isn't the same as understanding the rules to the game.  Play the game well and win.  You can drink the kool-aid all day long and still fail.
AirForce,3dlmv7,Dimsdale53,3,Fri Jul 17 08:34:44 2015 UTC,"True, the rules of the game have changed...I guess I just need to learn the new rules.  The old rules suited me pretty well..."
AirForce,3dlmv7,Niirs,2,Fri Jul 17 08:40:27 2015 UTC,It used to be msgts learning it.  Now it's tsgts.  Too bad you aren't SNCOs like in the Army and Marines.
AirForce,3dlmv7,Rwhit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:51:03 2015 UTC,"Significant awards are also written on decorations, that helps because the board sees all decorations and only 10 years of EPRs.  So if you earn a big award as a Airman, a SNCO board will still see it."

AirForce,3dlmv7,bluetrol,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:37:21 2015 UTC,CCAF and PME were masked during this board. So that stuff shouldn't have hurt or helped anyone.
AirForce,3dlmv7,meepketo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:43:32 2015 UTC,"Not to come off as a negative Nancy, but if you have deployed 6 times and only have one achievement medal, someone failed somewhere. Granted, only 10% receive medals (speaking directly on AFCENT Deployments here) on those, but you should have been awarded more than one little medal.    Have you expressed interest to go to PME?  Have you completed SEJMPE?  Course 15?  How come you took so long to get your CCAF?   Preparation for a board is more than just the year of.  I have been prepping for the E-8 boards since I was a SSgt.  Luckily, they implemented the E-7 Boards and it the years of preparation paid off.    I do not drink the kool-aid, never have, never will.  Set goals, pursue them daily and you will succeed."
AirForce,3dlmv7,snowseth,4,Fri Jul 17 09:58:43 2015 UTC,"This is a generalization, but they're looking for consistent growth and continuous superior performance.  If you look in your PRDA folder you see all the EPRs they considered.  Look through those EPRs from when you were an Airman---if you're just getting your CCAF wrapped up now, there's a good chance you may be a late bloomer.  They're pulling up a lot of records that have firewall 5s start to finish--people who completed their CCAFs as A1Cs and Bachelor's by TSgt.  Continuous progression.  If you had a rocky start but really got your stuff together over the past few years, there's a good chance they're still putting consideration on those older years."

AirForce,3dlmv7,Kupiga,3,Fri Jul 17 07:24:34 2015 UTC,"This is a very complicated question, and your best bet is to find a Chief, print all your records, and ask them to go through it with you and ask them what you need to do to get a better board score.  You'll get a more specific answer to your complete record.  But based on what you've told us, it's mostly because of what you've already pointed out... 11 yr TIS and no CCAF.  But that's not a complete answer because we only know what you've told us, you really need someone to go through everything and look for weaknesses you might not have thought of."
AirForce,3dlmv7,thee_jaay,2,Fri Jul 17 10:06:23 2015 UTC,Another benefit of going to the chief and asking him exactly what you need or what kind of role you need to fill in your squadron is that maybe a month down the line a job like what he suggests opens up and chief thinks of you.  Some might call this ass kissing but there's nobody else in your unit willing to sit down with chief and get your name on his radar as much as you will be.

AirForce,3dlmv7,adverseaction,2,Fri Jul 17 20:36:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly man it really comes down to what they are looking for that particular year.   Our senior missed chief the first year he was there by over 60 points, he had deployed that year and held a couple positions that were intended for a chief.  That next year he basically said fuck it, he bought a house and abandoned his hope for chief, he didn't do anything great that year and did his normal job, he planed on retiring that next year as well.   A couple of months before his retirement he got his notice that he was selected for chief, his board score was amazing and made it by a lot. He was absolutely shocked since he wasn't really trying at all that year, he showed us his board results and they were really night and day compared to each other."

Board scores are determined by considering performance, leadership, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence, specific achievements, and education. The board score is added to the weighted score to determine order of merit for promotion.  Breadth of exp could be interpreted as - moving around within your AFSC, special duty assignments, group, wing, NAF, MAJCOM, AETC duty, etc.  Specific Achievements - decorations, quarterly, annual awards.

On the other hand, flight chiefs are the ""lowest level"" when resolving anything, and a lot is micromanaged from Group and above ... so ... it's not like they have actual time to sit down and interact with everyone. Just too many people, and not enough time. So the solution ends up being a lazy, worthless, and seemingly self-serving bullet-chasing mass brief.

Last year, I averaged almost a 10% rate of return, and have had some years as high as 23%. Nothing's guaranteed, but at our age, that's a whole heckuva lot better than the 2 or 3% in the G fund.   C is large cap stocks. S is small cap stocks. I is international stocks. Google those more if you need to. You can split up your account however you like, so long as the total percentages equal 100%. The L-cycle funds are also an option if you want to park your money and forget about it - they'll automatically shift from a riskier investment approach to a more conservative one as your projected retirement date gets closer. It's basically someone else's mix of the C/S/I/F/G funds. I personally like to have more control over what my money is invested in and choose my funds myself, but you can do whatever you're comfortable with.   If you have a mix of Traditional and Roth contributions, the same percentages that you allocate across the different funds will be split amongst the tax designations. This isn't a big deal at our age, but something to keep and eye on and plan for in the future."

AirForce,3dl692,Gimmemomoneyyyy,6,Fri Jul 17 04:03:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is anything you'll find in an AFI, but...  There are different categories for AFAMs.  If it is for a specific achievement like being part of some high profile tiger team, a deployment, etc... then PT should play no part in the recommendation.  But, depending on the commander, it might.  If it is for meritorious service, like a PCS medal or three year medal, basically a broad period of time, then the fail may prevent recommendation.  It comes down to the Group CC, since that is the person who approves it, but the medal has to go through the wickets and there is a possibility that someone along the way like Sq Superintendent, or Sq CC will deny it.  If this happens, realize that they are gatekeepers and this is probably in accordance with the Gp CC's policy.  Often, when you have a fail in the past, followed by some passes, a push note will be enough to get the medal through.  Basically, in the situation you describe, I'd say three years after the fail if everything else is perfect and supervision does nothing.  It can be much sooner if everything is perfect and supervision fights for the individual.    However, remember that many people view medals as the last award that isn't like a pee-wee soccer trophy.  Not everyone gets one and perfection may be demanded for award, and if you run into this attitude no push note in the world will get the medal approved.  There are also some that demand not only perfection, but some massive, above and beyond acts.  Things dealing with ""mission impact""."

Anyway back on topic the way I see it. The point of CC is no one knows you are carrying. If you were to carry in uniform off the installation no one would know you are carrying so why wouldn't it be legal?   IANAL but where things could get tricky though someone could bring up that you are bearing arms. Which would fall under the arming and use of force AFI (31-117) of course the AFI makes no mention of carrying for personal use.

We're going to have a lot more 10 year MSgts.  Rather than having a lot of Airmen that promote to MSgt at 16 or 17 and get out at 20, they're going to set people up for MSgt at 10 years and get 10+ years out of them at the management level.  The Air Force already does this when hiring for key civilian positions that require a lot of continuity---they want the guy that can sit in the seat for 10 or 25 years, not the guy that wants +1 on his GS position for a couple years before retiring.    I think both the old and new systems have their merits and flaws, but there are a lot of reasons to promote certain people over others and it may possibly be a positive move to split people into career technicians and career managers, though obviously those finding themselves stuck in the technician category will be unhappy with it if they're unable to move up.    tl;dr: Fair? probably not. Best interest of the AF? Possibly."
AirForce,3dk9w8,meepketo,3,Fri Jul 17 00:18:51 2015 UTC,you wanted more a leadership path vs technician path? you got it!
AirForce,3dk9w8,renflo,8,Fri Jul 17 04:05:43 2015 UTC,With the new E7 boards combined with rating individuals based on performance in previous years...  I feel like we are definitely entering an air force of egg shells where if one person above you doesn't like you...  Your career is fucked and over at E5...    How many of us SNCOs would even be here if we had been exposed to such a ridiculous and arbitrary system?
AirForce,3dk9w8,americanpegasus,2,Fri Jul 17 03:07:58 2015 UTC,"Is this untrue of the old system though?  It has never been hard for a supervisor to nitpick, be vague, or write people up for minor things. When the rating period closes you could be left with a 5 with markdowns or even a 4 (""that's a good EPR!"").  Supervisors have always had the power to sabotage."

Now I think the new EES will throw a wrench in this, but it shouldn't shake up the status quo too bad.

AirForce,3dk9w8,AnalJelly,3,Fri Jul 17 01:36:07 2015 UTC,I'd love to see the EPRs of someone scoring 427. 12OAY or some stuff there.
AirForce,3dk9w8,meepketo,3,Fri Jul 17 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"I scored a 397.5, but someone maxed out their board score in my AFSC. My AFSC also had individuals hit 450, 442.5, 435, 427.5, 420, 412.4 and 405. It's literally insane."
AirForce,3dk9w8,xhades1,3,Fri Jul 17 02:06:34 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, I hope to see AFSC averages and stats posted--especially over the next coming years.  I'm sure you'll see certain AFSCs getting higher or lower than average EPR scores, AFSCs that do or don't typically stand out.  Theoretically, for most it will average out because lets say your AFSC pulls a lot of 4's and 5's across the AF, you're still only competing with them.  Lower 420s were the upper end for my AFSC."

AirForce,3dk9w8,xhades1,2,Fri Jul 17 02:36:11 2015 UTC,"If it works like the SMSgt boards, my understanding is that you have board members that are MSG but not necessarily linked to 6C0 looking at packages.  Maybe Contracting > CE > FSS on average, but at the end of the day its all compared AFS to AFS, so this could get interesting.  My board score was under 370 and I made it with lackluster test scores (mid 60s / low 70s)"

AirForce,3dk9w8,meepketo,2,Fri Jul 17 03:23:07 2015 UTC,"No overseas tours, only 2 bases (but 4 deployments) in my whole career, no joint SNCO PME, only enough college for my CCAF, but I'm good at my job and I had great senior leadership who made me do stuff outside my job and put me in for awards which I won at the group, wing and MAJCOM levels.  I really have had great leadership in my career who valued a strong work ethic and a focus on the mission and troops. I have always refused to write my own awards packages, my job is to recognize my troops, not myself. I kinda had the opposite experience than alot of people in the Air Force."

AirForce,3dk9w8,xhades1,2,Fri Jul 17 09:58:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm well the thing to remember I guess is that the pool of people who can't poke small holes in their record is very small.  In the end you have a lot of great stuff to board with, even if not getting top marks in some areas.  You're up against people with higher education and more overseas tours, but that had maybe stagnated in a position or not really won the awards.

The thing that may have helped was continuous recognition, with some kind of quarterly on every EPR for the last 10 years (usually technician since I don't volunteer too much). No AFSA, bake sales, car washes, no CCAF. Just a lot of work stuff and junior mentorship programs from the 5/6 level, along with teaching ASL.  I'm actually kind of a dirtbag, and a total screwball at work.   Not too sure who I blew, but he'll, it worked for me."
AirForce,3dk9w8,_Sock_puppet_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:01 2015 UTC,"Just cause it doesn't feel like you're sucking up doesn't mean you're not doing the right things.  Being a screwball at work is usually a good thing as long as you stay within the boundaries--there's a line you can cross where you go from bringing people together to alienating or offending others.  I don't know what the competition has been like, but typically NCOs aren't typically able to pull an award every EPR.  Most people are hard pressed to get a chance to even compete for one within a year, and we all know what you need on the packages to beat out the competition.   Bake sales and car washes at the membership level will score poorly.  Mentorship programs exactly what they want from an SNCO (I'm sure you've looked at the EPR form that your report is suddenly due on).  CCAF wasn't considered this year or else that would have hurt you.   Obviously you're doing something right."

I have two ccafs and my bachelors. I assumed I would have scored higher. I think this board looked at duty titles, decorations and assignments/awards. I also only have one long tour. So who knows man, think next years scoring will be way different, especially since they will look at education."
AirForce,3dk9w8,bluetrol,2,Fri Jul 17 03:47:18 2015 UTC,I actually put a little effort this year into testing and was 15 points short of meeting the board even.  My SKT score was 22 points better than last year but that doesn't help when I didn't put any time into the PFE and got a 49.  This testing cycle all but confirmed that I'm going to retire a TSgt with me being over 16 yrs in.
AirForce,3dk9w8,BobScratchit,7,Fri Jul 17 05:27:23 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure master is a rank I want. I'd love the money and would do my best but I am already tired of the bullshit.

I laugh at these goons because in one breath it's all about them in the next sentence they're preaching core values to younger airmen. Anyway hang in there.

AirForce,3dk9w8,PantsingtonHardware,3,Fri Jul 17 14:31:58 2015 UTC,I have mixed feelings about E7 boards.
AirForce,3dk9w8,davidj1987,3,Fri Jul 17 01:29:03 2015 UTC,"I think the lack of overseas assignments and not very many awards hurt, but not as bad as the markdowns. The board is supposed to see trough the old everyone gets a 5. If you have a markdown, they know something was up that rating period.  You'll be a lock next year with a deployment on there.   I made it, board score of 367.5. I have been in a few years less than you and was also an instructor. What hurt me, board score wise, was the education portion on our ""surfs"" was blacked out for board."
AirForce,3dk9w8,shitty_username,2,Fri Jul 17 03:17:30 2015 UTC,I think the only thing I had going for me was education and it wasn't looked at.  I just wish I can see my damn scores but I won't be able to until next week.

I understand they have shiny bullets with high ranks all over the place, but shouldn't the board scorers be able to read through that?"
AirForce,3dk9w8,thorvando,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are complaining, but here's the deal: Your EPRs reflect the work you've put in, and the board rates your work against others in your career field.  I'm tired of hearing people say 'Fuck 5/6 and AFSA Bullshit.'    I have no AFSA, 5/6, or volunteerism other than a booster club serving a unit of ~30 people.  My board scores weren't as high as I was hoping, but I still scored a 360 (average for my AFSC), and killed the tests and got promoted.  The board didn't seem to punish me because of lack of volunteerism.  Do your job, work your ass off, get recognized, and make sure that recognition is on both your decorations and your EPRs, because an NCO/Amn of the Quarter 11 years ago that is on an EPR won't be seen by the board, but if it's written into your dec, then it will be.  If you don't think that your EPRs are being written up to snuff, sit down with your Chief, and get inputs on what is important.  Write your bullets strong enough that your supervisor has no reason not to use them on your EPR, (because let's face it, you know what you did better than your supervisor), and make sure that your EPR sets you up to be competitive at the board.  There is nothing wrong with sitting down with your supervisor to rework your EPR if you're not satisfied, and your supervisor may not always know what's best for you.    The bottom line is this--none of us have ever been rated against our peers before on this scale, and like another user said, it can be deflating, (I know I was disappointed with my board score), but now you know that whatever was on your EPRs isn't good enough, and you need to figure out what you can do to make them better in the future..."
AirForce,3dk9w8,clearly_cunning,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:25:42 2015 UTC,"My board score was humbling.  I feel like I had great EPRs, although no deployments.

Even though I did make rank this time around, I'll definitely be sitting down with my Chief to figure out what I need to do for future boards.  Although I do think he kind of pre-empted this last month when he told us that a lot of MSgts feel the same gut-punch when they get their first board scores for SMSgt:  It's the first time a group sits down and actively rates you against your peers, and whether or not you agree with the criteria it can be pretty deflating."

I was listing in my head all of my friends and old supervisors who are currently SMSgts and every one of them have had an OS tour with the exception of my first supervisor who has been an MTI and a First Sgt but deployed as a shirt.  The deployment part is being taken care of later this year but being Medical it's hard to get a deploymemt tasking being at a clinic versus at a hospital or medical center. I have been to two clinics, taught Phase II at a hospital and now I'm at Medical Center and I'm just now deploying."

AirForce,3dk9w8,chargingmoose,0,Fri Jul 17 02:06:34 2015 UTC,"I disagree. At 450 points the board score makes up well over half of the total possible points. Next year will be a more accurate reflection of promoting the people the AF wants as SNCOs. This was the last year of the ""everyone gets a 5"" Air Force. Let's be honest, a lot of people that got promoted this year would have gotten the 200 pt mark on EPRs and may not have even met the board."
AirForce,3dk9w8,meepketo,2,Fri Jul 17 02:31:37 2015 UTC,"I believe that you would find very few, if any, exceptions that are getting a 400+ board score based on their EPRs, yet somehow had their EPRs and test scores keep them from escaping the bottom 40%. My SKT average was almost 50% this year--how many people had to score in the 30's or 40's to make that happen?"
AirForce,3dk9w8,afdy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:39:34 2015 UTC,"While it does make up ""half"" it actually doesn't. I do believe there is a minimum board score. You can't get below a 275 or something along those lines, so honestly the board score makes up like 1/4th of the total possible points, as everyone would at least get the minimum score... assuming it's like SMSgt/CMSgt"
AirForce,3dk9w8,Kupiga,0,Fri Jul 17 02:39:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  An extreme example would be to make the board score 1000 points, but the lowest you can score is a 999.  Yes it's 'worth' 1000 points but it only has a value of 1 possible point.  With a minimum of 275, literally everybody who meets the board gets 275 free points.  The board score only has a value of 450-275= 175.  Not 450."

Missed it by 9 last year (first time), was sure at the time that I would make it this year... until the EES bullshit.  Studied hard as hell, worked my ass off, and.... missed by 40+ this year.  Added everything up and I would have easily made the cutoff, if it was the close to last year's.  When I first came in years ago, I was told that I had the power to make my career through working hard and studying for rank.  This is no longer the case.  Everyone works hard, even if that work is, for a lot of this new breed that will be selected in the coming years, outside of their office doing whatever the fuck it is that those people who were always trying to put in STEP packages do.  Professional organizations, volunteer shit, on-duty-time school, you name it.  The equalizer for those professional volunteers was the fact that you could always test well and get your promotion.  It was in your hands.  That has now been nerfed.  Now you better hope your supervisor is a shit-hot package writer, and you better start capturing every damned bullet, as well as stealing the accomplishments of some other people.  Who knows what the hell the board wants?  There's no way to tell, and so there's really no way to know exactly what you should do anymore; your career is now in the hands of someone who you hope is a good writer, and a group of people (selected under a flawed system) who may be interested in education this year, or they may be interested in how much professional circlejerking you did at the local 5/6 organization--no way to tell.  Yay for having your own career in your hands!    Time to start playing sports with the commander, sucking up to the DO, and backstabbing as much as possible.  Don't want anyone else to know how to do any part of your job, because then they'll just steal your bullets, and they might get a higher rack and stack than you.  I'm so disappointed that this is what it has come to.  So disappointed in chief Cody.  Maybe it's bitterness on my part, but I just feel like it's a whole lot easier to say ""this is for the best"" when you've already benefited from the flawed system.  I foresee a whole lot of anger and bitterness in the coming years as some really dedicated asskissers start making rank."

It's not. Which is why the following phrase is also given in the 36-2903 5.1 a couple sentences in    Light ironing and center creasing of enlisted chevrons is authorized; however, repeated hot pressing or heavy ironing will accelerate the overall wear of the fabric. ABUs purchased by Air Force personnel through Army Air Force Exchange Stores (AAFES)   Unless all base honor guards, USAF Honor Guard, + the top officials in our chain of command are wrong, light pressing allows ironing the uniform as a whole and creasing the chevrons. I would think, however, the people who sign off on the regulations best know the intent of the regulations."

AirForce,3doix2,turnup_for_what,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:35:37 2015 UTC,Do not starch or hot press means exactly that- do not starch or hot press. Hot press is not ironing. A hot press is a specific machine that applies heat to both sides of the fabric at the same time; this is what is used on the blues material when you turn your stuff to get dry cleaned (also why sometimes wrinkles will be ironed into the sleeves). Light ironing is a completely different beast than using a hot press

What I'm reading is you may iron the chevrons to match the built-in crease, but that's it. The earlier statement about hot pressing the ABU says not to do it, the next statement specifically mentions chevrons. When this uniform was rolled out, the intent was to save you money by cutting wear on your uniforms - I'd go through a set of summer weight BDUs after about six months of wear (cumulative) due to ironing and starching, and that's in an office job."

Most of the ones on ADLS are done in captivate (glorified power point) or Flash, both have vulnerabilities to timeout features and communication with the LMS (ADLS) because they're still working on incorporating the new  SCORM compliance.

AirForce,3diowt,mcfarad,2,Thu Jul 16 22:43:09 2015 UTC,"Most of them are since they're built in Captivate or Flash.  Captivate just pushes back a variable or two to the LMS that says you're done and what the score was for some courses.  So all ADLS really does (for most courses) is house the courses and generate the certificate/reporting.  There are a few legacy courses out there that have the cert generated in the course.  All of ours that used that outdated procedure were updated when we did the big IE11 compatibility update to a lot of courses.  A few courses are partially server side though.  Per AFI we turn off the ability to easily view the source code but if you know how to get around it you can see which courses are ASP.net.  Captivate/Flash however are essentially giant .swf files that you really can't do that in.  Captivate is much easier and faster to build courses in and much easier to randomize test questions in.  As they get rid of more and more military programmers you're going to see more and more Captivate courses out there.  Which is fine if they're built right.  The ""Glorified powerpoint"" is an accurate description but somebody who is skilled with the full Adobe suite can make really amazing products in Captivate.    Also, everybody knows that flash is getting a lot of flak for security issues.  Captivate has a button you click to generate the course in HTML5 instead of flash.  We just do flash since it's encapsulated in one file and there are a few animations/widgets that don't work in HTML5."

I rectified it by getting an AZ ID card (not a DL) with my current AZ address, plus orders. You might need to buy the gun back in NJ with a NJ ID or get a new WY license/IF."
AirForce,3dk1pl,xXK33L0Xx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:40:43 2015 UTC,"Well the reason why I do it in Wyoming is because Jersey has incredibly strict gun laws, and getting the correct documentation to purchase a handgun there takes months.

Same thing applies to college students where they're a resident of the state where their school is while at school and a resident of their home state when home for summer or whatever.    Write the ATF asking for a clarification letter from them and if an FFL asks show them the ATF letter.  That should clear it up; if not, fuck that gun store and find someone who actually knows the laws."
AirForce,3dk1pl,thulfs,2,Thu Jul 16 23:05:15 2015 UTC,"The way I've always seen it practiced for the military is you can have it both ways.

Compartment syndrome is rare in the civilian population of runners and technically shouldn't be higher in the military, but it is. About 80% of military members who are diagnosed with compartment syndrome are boarded out within 18 - 24 months. Many MANY people who have it in the military are malingering and wanting to get out. This is a good way to do it because unless you have a major MTF near by its hard to positively test for.   If you're not malingering and want to run, and want to avoid a MEB, the only definitive test is a barbaric compartment pressure test. Request it. Keep requesting it at an MTF or outside sports medicine facility.  If your test comes back positive there is no circumstance that they can accuse you of malingering. Keep requesting it.   They always assume malingering because the disease process pops up when training for the PT test. It looks like a slam dunk. A lot of docs have never seen it.   I have a video of mine around here somewhere, ill post it if I can find it.  I'll add some photos of the Surgery too.

At that level, if you're not all sunshine and ponies, you're 'that guy.'   I was very much that guy, and there is a price to be paid for that.     There is a line from Shakespeare's play Coriolanus -- ""I had rather be their servant in my way, than sway [rule] with them in theirs.""   I found that very relevant to my last few years in.    To me it means I'd rather forsake their accolades but keep my integrity--but it does mean being aware of the decision you're making.

I've learned that it comes at personal expense though, and for the most part, I was fine with that. The pats on the head were nice because they felt like a sincere thank you at the end of a tour.

Not the same performance as your peers. You're welcome to make your case to leadership, but I stand by my decision.""  Now, for context, take those accomplishments I listed above. That's a fraction of the things I've done in the reporting period covered by the dec package, but things kept coming back to a lack of volunteerism, or pursuit of higher education. That would have been nice to do, but I work in a small shop, and still a shift worker as a SNCO. Our section is required by AFI to have at least 2 personnel in the shop for safety and security purposes, but we actually had to get a waiver due to low manning, and I've worked solo more times than I'd care to admit. So between revolving shift work, mandatory staff meetings that happen outside my shift hours, and a list of additional duties that take up what's left of my free time, I don't have the remaining time or energy to take a class or lead any more projects.  edit:  As for the ""checking out mentally"" bit, you could also call it burning out.

I was there as a dependent in high school and then stationed there as well...(bad luck Brian assignments) it can be boring but there are good outdoor things to do in the area. Also the locals aren't that bad, they are friendly and you will be thrown off by people ""waving"" at you as you drive around. If you encounter any unfriendly locals just take a minute to think of how you would react to strangers constantly telling you they hate your hometown and how much it sucks -- you might become a little weary of it.  There are good places to eat other than chains:   Saeng's Orient (right off base) not fancy/pretty looking at all but oh my the food is delicious. Leal's this is on 60/84, local family owned mexican food -- there are a few others in the area but this was my favorite.  Taco Box- local taco place, they have a delicious bacon/avocado burrito that makes me drool thinking of it to this day.    Also ---> Wienerschnitzel gotta try it at least once!  Couple honorable mentions:    Shogun Steakhouse (original burned down so can't vouch directly but same owners I believe and food was always good.  Cotton Patch -- try out the chicken fried steak Cattle Baron Steakhouse (Portales, NM) 15-20min drive from base Roosevelt Brewing Company (Portales, NM) local brewed beer and good food   Onto outdoor things to burn off the calories:   Oasis State Park This little gem is hidden outside of the Portales gate and is great for fishing and hanging out. Rent some poles from outdoor rec and go.  Bottomless Lakes State Park  Palo Duro State Park take the donkey ride around the canyon, rent bikes or hike   Someone already mentioned Carlsbad (caverns) but you will also be within driving distance to these bigger cities/things to do. Now it won't be a lets drive there during the work week thing as they are at least an 1.5hrs away.    Roswell NM (go see the aliens) 1.5hrs away Ruidoso NM Inn of the Mountain Gods 2.5-3hrs away Lubbock, TX - 1.5hrs away -- small college town and if you want chain restaurants you can find them all here with shopping and nightlife/bars. If you are there during football season and like college games check the schedule. Also a couple reality shows like Car Chasers are filmed here.  Amarillo, TX - 1.5hrs away -- similar to Lubbock as in ""normal"" sized mall with plenty of chain stores/restaurants -- hit the Big Texan and if your game try the 72oz steak challenge [Man vs Food](http://bigtexan.com/man-vs-72oz-steak/]    Above are day trips, we would get up early leave and come back late and totally worth escaping.   Now Santa Fe (5hrs drive) and Albuquerque (4hr drive) are a lot bigger cities with more to do.   Enjoy saving up money and resting during the week, eat at local places and travel a bit on the weekend. I would cry if I ever had to be stationed there again but really if you approach it with a positive attitude it won't be that bad since at least you know when you will be leaving!

And, most importantly, you won't be living in a military town!  You will be living in a place that happens to have a military base, but whose economy is not based on military activities.

We go over monthly patient satisfaction reports. Mishaps. What we can do better. Practice sutures. Different procedures. Inventory our stock rooms. Commanders call. Go over a computer program we use and cover how to do something correctly. It is mainly to go over training to keep our national certifications up to date. This is for the 4N0 career field. We have NREMT we need to practice skills monthly. (Catheters, NG tubes, IV's, staples, etc). Sorry for mobile format."

Is the NREMT and the certification training something that takes longer than 2-3 hours?  Ops has training that gets done too (just on a rotating basis where part of the workforce trains and part operates), but I'd be open to discussing why medical training is longer and more in depth."
AirForce,3dja2d,yamiinterested,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"NREMT requires a set amount of CE training to renew for EMT it's 72 hours. It's not something you can just do, the training has to cover certain topics, and it has to be documented to get the credit. It's also renewed every two years to, so the training is usually actual class work, then hands on training.  Here is a good PDF of the refresher requirements and that's just for the EMT-B part.  While I'm not in, I did go through the training when I was a FF/EMT before we PCS'd.  I let my NREMT lapse, because we left before I got all my continuing Education done, however my state license is good for 3 years, if I was affiliated, which I'm not anymore so it's just in limbo right now.  So if I go back into it, I can just take a refresher course and retest."

If you really want to understand, look into what it takes for the NREMT, and then what it takes for the CE's that's required.  It probably requires down time, because it takes time to go through the training, do the practicals, answer questions, make sure everyone is on the same page training wise, do the paperwork and have it signed off.  On top of that I'm sure there are other things that they are training in, not just NREMT related.  I mean would you rather go to someone who is performing medical things sometimes on people who has lapsed their training, Or would you rather know they have been trained and it's recent in how to actually do medical things to people?  After all if you want them trained, then what's a day for training?"

The training we do does take all day. Although on the other hand I don't have an answer or reason why we couldn't do the rotating schedule like maintenance does. My only guess would be that it would take much more work to schedule a technician and nurse for each doctor. If we pull half of them we have to cover with others.

Building tents, getting trained on a lot of the heavy vehicles, CBRNE, CPR, SABC, etc.   They can also involve sitting around doing CBTs or our regular jobs. A lot of it depends on how Leadership wants to run it."
AirForce,3dja2d,Will0907,2,Thu Jul 16 20:54:49 2015 UTC,"I get vehicles and MAYBE tents every once in a while to maintain proficiency. But do you really need an extra day to relearn the (bi)annual stuff without a tasker?   Don't get me wrong, absolutely do that if your schedule supprts it. Just seems so foreign to me.  Our training days always consist of the AF/Wing directed stuff for an hour then back to business."
AirForce,3dja2d,deaddebate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:08:27 2015 UTC,Speaking from the experience of a former non 4N0 medical career field we closed the 3rd Thursday of every month for training. It was generally to do stuff deployment related that was not part of our job in the states. Or for the people who worked in other buildings (we were all spread out) to relearn how to do stuff that the others did daily. That way if a tasking came down everyone was always current.

It won't be too cold for another 3 months or so.  Right now the ND state fair is happening, and it's hosted in Minot. People from all over the region including Canada visit for it, and popular bands play every year. Aerosmith is among them this year.  In the summer, I go camping a lot in the Turtle ""Mountains"" or head south out to the Badlands or the Black Hills. This summer I'm taking a train west to Glacier National Park for a week and a half of backpacking. There's also a good group of people who get together and play Ultimate Frisbee a few times a week, and I usually join them when I'm not busy with classes at Minot State University.   Minot itself has gotten a lot of new restaurants lately, among them being Sonic, Panera Bread, and Fuddruckers. There are also a lot of other great restaurants/pubs that aren't part of chains like Ebenezer's which is a really great Irish pub with live music all the time.  The sky up here is beautiful. I took this picture tonight after grilling some kebabs with friends because it was so dang nice out. http://i.imgur.com/vHfVozsh.jpg The sky is clear enough due to a lack of light pollution that I've gotten really into astronomy and astrophotography here. I've taken some really sweet pictures in the last year, and I can't wait for the days to start getting cooler to cancel out some atmospheric distortion caused by heat in the air.  The winter isn't all that bad here, military people just like complaining about things that they can't control. Everyone that I've talked to that has either grown up here or moved here by choice has very little to complain about. That said, it does get cold. Ambient temperatures of roughly -30°F is an everyday commonality here in the middle of the winter. If you buy decent cold weather gear, you'll be fine. I ran a 5k last winter in -17° ambient temperatures, I just had to wear a skin tight neck gaitor underneath a bandana and ski goggles. I've tent-camped in -30°F wind chill and stayed warm. It's alllll about your gear and your attitude. You can either complain about the cold, or spend a quarter of your paycheck one month on some good gear, or just stick with the free gear you're issued.

If they want someone within that 90 days they immediately throw your resume out.  If they don't know, they call you, they might interview you, it will come up. Like /u/_Kline said, he had a job offer, too far out, called back and got a job.  Would he of received the call if he put ""cannot start until March 2016""?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  It will also give you an opportunity to practice some interview skills.  As a side note, I had two interviews in the last year.  Both times they asked when I could start, when I said not for x months, they went another direction and told me to call them back when I'm within 90 days."

THRMIS was the worst way to get someones hopes up when they shouldn't.  It was a good tool to see what overall manning should be at a specific location, but most of the time it was way out of date or flat out wrong on what positions were filled.  There is a lot of work that goes into building manning information and most comes in the forms of Chiefs networking around the command/base to get people where they need to be.  THRMIS was designed to provide high-level input to senior leaders as to where we stood at a specific point, not to be a real-time manning predictor."
AirForce,3dil7i,notmyrealname86,0,Thu Jul 16 17:02:43 2015 UTC,It was better than building a bop or assignment preference in the dark.
AirForce,3dil7i,notmyrealname86,2,Thu Jul 16 18:00:23 2015 UTC,Maybe for your career field.  For a lot of AFSC's calling the unit you wanted to go to was much more efficient.
AirForce,3dil7i,notmyrealname86,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"Not really, the data was in the past, and wasn't always accurately portrayed.  For example one AFSC showed authorizations at a Guard base as part of the TFI stuff.  However those authorizations are not going to be filled for a long time because the Guard doesn't want AD at that base.  THRMIS was unable to accurately represent that. It was semi-useful for BOP's, but so is calling the bases you are interested in.  As for assignment preferences AMS and the listings on there are more useful."
AirForce,3dil7i,USS_Slowpoke,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:13 2015 UTC,"No, it really wasn't.  The best way was using AMS cycles for normal assignment preferences, and either you calling, or your supervision calling the bases you were interested in or the AFPC functional to get manning levels at that location for BOP's and Follow on assignments."
AirForce,3dil7i,notmyrealname86,0,Thu Jul 16 19:35:27 2015 UTC,"I used it for years and managed to help a lot of people align their follow ons after korea.  Worked wonders.  Never failed me. If you use the 6 month projected portion of it, it was fairly accurate.  I witnessed numbers change from my PSC code at my last 2 assignments.  Was always accurate."
AirForce,3dil7i,sitrucb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:57:11 2015 UTC,It was a decent tool to gauge were we could go.
AirForce,3dil7i,afderrick,2,Thu Jul 16 16:20:05 2015 UTC,It was more than decent.  If you know your way around you can enter PSC Codes of the units you can get assigned and find out the 6 month projected manning.  Then just measure the deviation from the career fields overall manning in that grade and you got yourself a base that the Air Force definitely needs filled. If you don't do the 6 month projected manning it's not that useful.  It's like using 6 month old data.

I was there as a dependent in high school and then stationed there as well...(bad luck Brian assignments) it can be boring but there are good outdoor things to do in the area. Also the locals aren't that bad, they are friendly and you will be thrown off by people ""waving"" at you as you drive around. If you encounter any unfriendly locals just take a minute to think of how you would react to strangers constantly telling you they hate your hometown and how much it sucks -- you might become a little weary of it.  There are good places to eat other than chains:   Saeng's Orient (right off base) not fancy/pretty looking at all but oh my the food is delicious. Leal's this is on 60/84, local family owned mexican food -- there are a few others in the area but this was my favorite.  Taco Box- local taco place, they have a delicious bacon/avocado burrito that makes me drool thinking of it to this day.    Also ---> Wienerschnitzel gotta try it at least once!  Couple honorable mentions:    Shogun Steakhouse (original burned down so can't vouch directly but same owners I believe and food was always good.  Cotton Patch -- try out the chicken fried steak Cattle Baron Steakhouse (Portales, NM) 15-20min drive from base Roosevelt Brewing Company (Portales, NM) local brewed beer and good food   Onto outdoor things to burn off the calories:   Oasis State Park This little gem is hidden outside of the Portales gate and is great for fishing and hanging out. Rent some poles from outdoor rec and go.  Bottomless Lakes State Park  Palo Duro State Park take the donkey ride around the canyon, rent bikes or hike   Someone already mentioned Carlsbad (caverns) but you will also be within driving distance to these bigger cities/things to do. Now it won't be a lets drive there during the work week thing as they are at least an 1.5hrs away.    Roswell NM (go see the aliens) 1.5hrs away Ruidoso NM Inn of the Mountain Gods 2.5-3hrs away Lubbock, TX - 1.5hrs away -- small college town and if you want chain restaurants you can find them all here with shopping and nightlife/bars. If you are there during football season and like college games check the schedule. Also a couple reality shows like Car Chasers are filmed here.  Amarillo, TX - 1.5hrs away -- similar to Lubbock as in ""normal"" sized mall with plenty of chain stores/restaurants -- hit the Big Texan and if your game try the 72oz steak challenge [Man vs Food](http://bigtexan.com/man-vs-72oz-steak/]    Above are day trips, we would get up early leave and come back late and totally worth escaping.   Now Santa Fe (5hrs drive) and Albuquerque (4hr drive) are a lot bigger cities with more to do.   Enjoy saving up money and resting during the week, eat at local places and travel a bit on the weekend. I would cry if I ever had to be stationed there again but really if you approach it with a positive attitude it won't be that bad since at least you know when you will be leaving!

AirForce,3ddtfd,Rock0rSomething,40,Wed Jul 15 14:18:08 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest problems I found when I got over to the Air Force for my exchange tour was that outside my little bubble in the ground-combat part of the Air Force, maybe 10% of officers were under the delusion that their rank and their position was a tool for their own advancement.  10% is a fucking TON of arrogance for an officer corps, especially because it bleeds over to the rest of the guys as not only influence, but also perception from the part of those who are led.  No other service (and I've been at war or at sea with Army, Navy, and obviously Marine...to say nothing of foreign allies) has this degree of animosity, and it's a huge problem.  Officers, your job is to make everything work together.  You are the cables that connect all the components.  Your reason for existence is to enable your enlisted men's talents, knowledge, and subject matter expertise to accomplish the mission.  You need to understand the mission in macro (hence your requirement for education, and lack of hyperspecialization).  You need to understand your men and their abilities in micro.    And you need to realize that you, as in your individual self, isn't the objective here.  Your rank isn't about your glory.  It's a tool to fight for your men and the mission.  That salute isn't to tell YOU that you are awesome.  You are the unit mascot, the face of the men's efforts...they are saluting their unit, not your individual meatbag.    Are there topics of discussion that are more suited for officers because it pertains to our specialty of organizational leadership and design?  Absolutely.  But We should never exclude anyone.  Ideas matter - and it doesn't matter where they come from.  I'll close with this: here is how I teach my Lieutenants to make decisions (and the reason AFSOC 'hired' me was to teach Lieutenants and young Captains this kind of thing.)   Orient.  Figure out the nature of the situation.  Understand the big picture - how does your piece fit in to national security? Observe.  This is the part where your SNCOs should be talking your ear off.  What are the particulars of the problem?  What are the recommended solutions (POLL YOUR MEN.  Solicit their INPUT and listen honestly.  Ask questions about what they know, and what they think.)  What are viable courses of action? Decide  SNCOs, here's where you are fucking up and failing your Lieutenants.  This is an Army/Air Force problem.  Some forget that a main job of the SNCO is to train, mentor, develop, and guide YOUR Lieutenants.  This doesn't mean making decisions for him - quite the opposite.  It means teaching him to make good decisions by letting him have control, supporting his efforts, and arming him with the knowledge to become a good leader.  If you are shit-talking your lieutenants, you are the absolute worst kind of SNCO - you are the counterpart to the arrogant officer. Act.  Do what's right for the mission.  The men want to be part of a winning team.  Make sure their team wins - that you accomplish the mission.  Also, stay engaged.  Turn some wrenches, share the suffering, understand what it's like in the trenches."

AirForce,3ddtfd,pawnman99,7,Wed Jul 15 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"I was an officer for 5 years, and I think it's greater than 10%. Most officers should be required to take simple management courses, not just military leadership courses (disclaimer: I had a BS and MBA in management prior to my commission). Service-leadership is effective, but often neglected. I left (in part) because of the BS I had to put up in my leadership chain and with fellow officers.   You are absolutely correct that officers should exist to help enable those under them to get their job done effectively. Too many officers are just looking out for their own careers."
AirForce,3ddtfd,pawnman99,5,Wed Jul 15 17:30:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about your experience.  What would your % be?  And I agree 100%...not nearly enough leadership training or experience out there, and it starts with the pilots.  USMC pilots are stick wigglers, yes, but they are also platoon commanders, operations officers, etc. for the Marines in the squadron.  Not enough of that 'lead the men' exists over in big blue."
AirForce,3ddtfd,slowrecovery,6,Wed Jul 15 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"That's because most pilots are students until they are captains, and then they get to be ""assistant chief of x"".  Most aviation officers in the AF get their first real crack at leadership around the 7-8 year point of their career."

The current plan is to only use the UPT pipeline for one year while the RPA-unique training pipeline increases from approximately 190 to 300 RPA pilot graduates per year.

My job isn't nearly as bad, as I'm old, bitchy, and an attached flyer.   If they want to fix it, and they don't, then they'd start with fixing the UMD to reflect a sustainable dwell, and then open up enough staff billets so that we could get people promoted and into commands instead of half of them merely being a ticket punch for a fighter pilot on his way to a star."

AirForce,3deifu,ImS0hungry,5,Thu Jul 16 02:55:06 2015 UTC,"As a lowly Airman I once got an LOC for being late from my flight chief.  I was late because I am absent minded as fuck and couldn't find my CAC for the life of me. I called my supervisor and everything before being late and told him the situation and he told me not to worry about it and just get to work when I could. I ended up finding it (it had fallen behind my dresser) and was about 30 minutes late. My flight chief decided this warranted paperwork and my supervisor didn't get my back so my flight chief gave me an LOC.   Me being the cry baby back bitch I can be when I don't get what I want I refused to sign it. I was pissed and decided to ""make a statement"" by not signing it. Well my flight chief was kind of confused by this and just said ""well fuck it Amn Holyhamsandwich you figured it out. No LOC for you!"" And he promptly tore it up. Just kidding. That didn't happen. He got pissed that I refused to sign it and just called an NCO into the office, reread me the entire LOC again, and had the NCO sign as a witness.   Lesson learned. Just sign the thing. 90% of people giving paperwork don't want to anyway. Not signing it just does more harm than good."
AirForce,3deifu,BobScratchit,3,Wed Jul 15 20:09:41 2015 UTC,"As far as I am aware - signing an LOC is compulsoary but it's not an admission of guilt.  It is ""I acknowledge receipt of this peice of paper which isn't an LOC but actually an intention to give me an LOC"" then she has 3(?) days to write a rebuttal.  She can go to ADC for help with the rebuttal.  Once the supervisor receives that, the supervisory signs another peice of paper saying ""I've read the rebuttal and my decision is....""

(I could be wrong)  Signing the ticket means you acknowledge receiving the ticket and can be let go until you pay the fine or go to court.  You can go to court and be found innocent and not have to pay a thing.  To me, not signing a LOC means that your ""friend"" is not acknowledging authority and is showing immaturity on the matter.

The Air Force isn't for everyone for the whole 20- you've done your time honorably, and that's all that can be asked of you. There's absolutely no shame in getting out at 10 years.

AirForce,3dfgcw,Woody151,2,Wed Jul 15 21:16:32 2015 UTC,"a.) ribbon rack has no bearing on quality b.) unless they are air force level awards you wont get ribbons for it c.) need a medal deployment would be your best bet. d.) each OTS board has different needs/requirements - what's far more important is your push letters, your degree, and what board you are going for.  Generally you'd be up for a ""rank appropriate"" award every 3-4 years based on meritorious work. I say rank appropriate because of the scope involved - SNCOs by definition have larger scope and are more likely to get Meritorious Service vice AFAM or AFCOM  For your reserve meritorious medal here's your criteria as pulled from GOOGINT:  Criteria It is awarded for exemplary behavior, efficiency and fidelity during a four-year period while serving in an enlisted status in the Air Force Reserve.  The medal is awarded for a period of four continuous years service computed from the date of assignment to a training category A, B or D for individuals with a beginning date before July 1, 1972.  For individuals with a beginning date after June 30, 1972, the length of service requirement is three continuous years of service. Award the medal to individuals who accrue at least one year, but less than three years, toward award of the medal and terminate their enlisted Reserve status as a commissioned or warrant officer, regardless of the beginning eligibility date.  Creditable service ends when called to active duty. A period of more than 24 hours between Reserve enlistments counts as a break in service. Credit must begin anew after the break. An active duty period is not a break in service.  Do not credit service performed in the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps or Coast Guard Reserve components. When determining service computation, exclude service as a commissioned officer.   Best bet - talk to your leadership and request an example of a submitted ARMM so that you know what to ""work towards"" and you'll see the level of scope/criteria. Also, Rule #7 is ""Stop Reinventing the Damn Wheel"" - dig through your office/flight/units records for other submitted medals and see what the scope is."

AirForce,3dfrqk,SuperCommBros,3,Wed Jul 15 22:42:21 2015 UTC,I still do the same running exercise that I did in basic. Run/jog for 15 minutes and sprint for 1 minute and then jog for 2 for the last 15 minutes. My last run time was 10:19.
AirForce,3dfrqk,Kill_The_Hero,3,Thu Jul 16 00:38:09 2015 UTC,"I am a fitness freak. Not a body builder, but fitfreak. And I do not recommend any of those programs. However, that is not to say that you won't gain anything from the programs. Doing any program is better than not exercising at all and gains will be clear within 3 weeks.  Some key shit:  1) Here is the secret to pushups - do them. No program in the world will drastically improve your pushups besides programs that focus on pushups. I believe there is a Pushup program you can google that is similar to Couch-to-5k. It is designed to take you from 1 pushup to 100 pushups. If you want to crank out more pushups for PT, do them every single day. Do them when you wake up. Do them during lunch. Do them before you hit the sack. Dont count them. Just do them to failure and be consistent.  2) Increasing your run time and general cardio comes down to a few key factors: forcing your heart to pump blood in intense intervals, and getting oxygen to your blood. The more oxygen that oxidizes in your blood, the more fat calories you will burn. This means, for a basic example, you need to be running 60 seconds then walking 90 seconds - and breathing as much as possible, deep and clean. Push your heart into overdrive, then allow it to calm down, then push it back into overdrive. Its just like working out - when you do 10 repetitions, you then wait 30-60 seconds, then repeat. Apply that logic to running. Do it for a minimum of 30 minutes a day, alternating between sprinting and jogging or walking. Do it on a hill if you really want to put in work.  3) You can do your running and pushups on the same days because like i said, pushup everyday. Running should be done 3 to 5 days a week - leaving a few days of rest because recovery is the key to building muscle density, strength and endurance. Programs are unnecessary, you could do nothing but pushups situps and running 3-5 days a week and be in 10x better shape than most of our guys, on top of looking and feeling good. You can feel free to do any program u find on the internet - but nothing beats solid hardwork and determination and if you apply that to even the simplest of workouts, you'll experience drastic change.  Dont expect results in 2 weeks. Keep at it, give it a month-2 months before you start switching up your schedule. Pm me when you've made gains.   Note: I cant offer deficit caloric intake advice because I have to take in 5-6000 calories a day to maintain the weight I want."
AirForce,3dfrqk,Love_Our_water,2,Thu Jul 16 03:43:51 2015 UTC,"I think this is the program you're talking about.  There's one for sit-ups as well.  Both have apps in the Google Play store, if you're the kind of person that takes their phone along to track every workout."

AirForce,3dfrqk,modern_quill,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"large subs from Charlie's   Nailed it.   Realistically though I push through about 4500-5100 on average, 6k  fairly rarely. My metabolism is stupid fast, and I surely do not enjoy eating that much as it consumes too much time and money. And I'm far from a saint, its not 4500+ of pure healthy foods. I can afford to eat junk now and then which helps because I lose 2-3 lbs a day if I dont sustain. Its honestly not that much food though, ever seen the michael phelps challenge? Now that's ridiculous.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw8iljkD1So"

AirForce,3dfrqk,ConvertsToMetric,2,Thu Jul 16 20:06:45 2015 UTC,No direct experience with either program. In my experience though focusing on push-ups and sit ups isn't necessary. Just do some kind of working out that challenges you and you can improve on.   I've gotten 90's with nothing done but lifting weights.
AirForce,3dfrqk,jjxx101,2,Wed Jul 15 23:04:16 2015 UTC,"it will certainly help with weight-loss, which will in turn help with every other category. i've never used it for a PT test, but it can't hurt to try."
AirForce,3dfrqk,bearcam,2,Wed Jul 15 23:05:14 2015 UTC,"Insanity is great for cardio.  If your run sucks, do insanity for a month and then hit the track.  I don't recommend doing the second month.  It targets small muscles that sculpt you but serve no real purpose. The first month goes after large muscle groups.  So... Do the first month twice then hit the track a few times.   It has a nice core section but your Push-ups will suffer.  You'll need to find time to toss in 30-40 random Push-ups in the day.   P90x is a much longer workout.  It doesn't give you a focused cardio workout and is more focused on overall body shaping and strength. It takes almost double the time though.   It's all about your goals and which one better fits your body type and the improvement area you need."
AirForce,3dfrqk,Kedriastral,2,Thu Jul 16 00:22:30 2015 UTC,"I've only done P90X, while my wife has done both P90X and Insanity. She loves the short duration of the Insanity workouts, and both of us felt like P90X dragged on a bit. Insanity is also focused more on the cardio, from my understanding. I enjoyed P90X and felt like I gained from it, but not nearly as much as I gain from going to the gym 4-5 times a week.  The ab workout for P90X is awesome though, I really did enjoy it and felt like it helped me on my situps. Overall though, if you want to increase your run time and your pushups the best way is to just get out and run and do pushups."
AirForce,3dfrqk,Arriik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:56:08 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't like them. If you honestly want to get working out, stick to it, and show progression, then you should really work on your own routine and build on it from there. If you are just looking for something simple to do that will get you to a 90, then sure. These will probably work."
AirForce,3dfrqk,AnAngryAvocado,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:17:01 2015 UTC,"If you're going to stick to it every day, go for it.  If you're not, find an exercise program that you will stick to.  For your waist, separate your workout calories from your standard daily intake.    Do your TDEE with the setting on No Exercise from here.  Next, determine how many calories you burn in a given week.    TDEE - 500 x 7 = Weekly total Exercise calories burned + weekly total / 7 = daily intake.   Track with Myfitnesspal."
AirForce,3dfrqk,fatharro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:11:55 2015 UTC,My advice. Use http://www.myfitnesspal.com to log your intake.  Exercise dependent on required outcome. You want to do pushups? Do pushups. You want situps? Do situps.  Run time? Run. One of my current exercise routines; run for about 20 minutes. Then do pullups / pushups. Followed by P90X AbRipperX.

Google ""ring injuries"" or ""de-gloved finger"" to see some NSFL images of what can happen with rings.  There are reasons maintainers and other industrial workers can't wear them at work.  Now I would guess that a silicone ring would prevent a lot of these injuries, but is it so bad to be without your ring on for a few hours while you exercise?  Now not having your ring for an extended period of time for whatever reason, which probably bothers you for personal reasons and I get that, why not get a cheap actually decent looking ring if it bothers you, and take it off for workouts?"

AirForce,3dbhog,Soybeanrice,4,Wed Jul 15 04:06:42 2015 UTC,"I don't really follow this logic.  Because let's do the inverse... wouldn't you expect that people who grew up under ""X"" system and benefited from it would also be the same group that would insist ""WAPS is great""?  Because by admitting WAPs needs to be fixed, aren't they saying by inference that they might not have been the best picks for Chief?  So that's not exactly self-serving.  But if they were currently arguing against the rest of the AF that ""the current system is perfect"", I'd bet that in this forum we'd be criticizing the Chiefs for ""continuing the legacy of a flawed system just because they benefited from it""  We are ALL a product of some kind of education/mentoring/promotion system.

The idea of marking someone down for something they did in a previous rating period is fucked beyond all reason.

AirForce,3dbhog,Niirs,8,Wed Jul 15 04:15:22 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. EPRs are based off of your performance during the rating period. It is sad how many times supervisors must be reminded that they are evaluating a rating period NOT an airman's career. The AFI even states it.  An article 15 will hurt your EPR of course and could lead to admin sep processes, but if a member weathers the storm, attaining E9 is very much possible. Especially if you get the art15 early in your career."

Because it was AETC, our directives were aircraft regs, not comm reqs. Yes, we did FOD inspections on our radios as part of the PMIs. It was stupid, everyone knew it was stupid, even inspectors knew it come UCI time. Did it anyway.  We had an old Chief who was from the aircraft maint world. Knew fuck-all about comm, and wasn't interested in knowing about comm. He was there because the org chart was set up that way.   We measured everything, because that's what TQM meant. Up times, down times, PMI times, number of PMIs, cost of parts, blah, blah, blah. Once a week, every work center put it all in a spreadsheet and sent it to the Chief.   He printed it out, put it in a folder and filed it. That was his job. If you didn't send it by 1PM on Friday, he'd call looking for it. Mind you, no one ever looked at it. Even inspectors, when they came down.   E-9 pay to print out a dozen spreadsheets and file them once a week. He finally retired-retired, and we quit doing that little piece of stupidity."

Usually the assignments come with a follow-on base already listed on your orders. Because they get priority usually they get the base they want (but not always). These are also how someone who started stateside might get out of CONUS to get OCONUS."
AirForce,3dd55f,mlara51,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:19:23 2015 UTC,"Haha I've never heard of Morón AB and thought you might be calling me a moron for thinking Korea was one.  So let me get this straight, if I list Korea, Morón, Thule, Izmir, Incirlik or OCONUS as one of my top choices, there's a high chance I'll get it; and the next base is already chosen for me?  What if the tour is extended long?"
AirForce,3dd55f,mlara51,3,Wed Jul 15 10:36:49 2015 UTC,"Obvious disclaimer up front: You are always at the mercy of the AF, nothing is guaranteed.  Short your bases are easier to get to because every 12-15 months new people are coming in. So with a turnover rate, means more people can get picked up for it. So Korea is significantly easier to get than say Hawaii. So how most people get places like Hawaii is they elect to go to a short tour, and then choose Hawaii as their follow-on. Again, no guarantee they get Hawaii though. You submit a list of follow-on assignments you would like, and AF does its best to get you one. Once you are overseas, it's much easier to stay overseas and move around since all OCONUS personnel get to choose off the base listing that is released every quarter (this is the super simple version of it. There are other factors that determine which list you choose from)."
AirForce,3dd55f,mlara51,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:49:00 2015 UTC,"I understand that we're at the mercy of the AF; but saying I get lucky and get a short tour to Korea or, you're saying I get to ""choose"" (yet again update my ""dream-sheet"", just with a higher chance than normal) my next destination? Whether it's OCONUS or CONUS?"
AirForce,3dd55f,mlara51,2,Wed Jul 15 10:57:50 2015 UTC,"Correct. Say Hawaii has 10 slots open at the time you will be leaving your short tour. You will have first priority for one of those 10 slots. If everyone who was a short tour passes on those 10 slots or doesn't fill up all 10, then overseas personnel who are PCS'ing that month (known as your DEROS month) will get a shot at those slots. Then after that, CONUS gets a chance to fill those 10 slots. Again this is a very simplified version of the process, but you can see why CONUS people have a harder time getting to OCONUS unless they choose something like Korea. Luck of the draw if you end up CONUS/OCONUS after tech school though."
AirForce,3dd55f,mlara51,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:05:46 2015 UTC,"So short tour gets priority? I thought extended-long got priority for OCONUS bases  By the way, ""Luck of the draw if you end up CONUS/OCONUS after tech school though."" confuses me. CONUS means North America and OCONUS means anywhere outside of North America right? Where all am I supposed to go after Tech if not CONUS/OCONUS?"
AirForce,3dd55f,notmyrealname86,2,Wed Jul 15 11:21:07 2015 UTC,"Short tour, then those who are currently OCONUS who applied for extended long, then OCONUS who applied for standard/long, then CONUS. AFI 36-2110 (can google it to find) is the assignments AFI. Those who learn this really tend to understand the system and get where they want easier than someone who has no clue what they are doing. So it's definitely one of the more important AFI's to learn.  And I just meant whether you end up CONUS or OCONUS is luck of the draw, and honestly your career field. Some career fields have no overseas locations, or maybe only 1 or 2 bases overseas, so they are really hard to get. There are just a lot of factors and luck when it comes to bases and where you end up."

Or would I have to ask to be put in again and leave it up to the AF and luck?   There is something called IPCOT (In-Place Consecutive Overseas Tour). You can apply for this when you're getting ready to PCS, and you are basically asking the AF to let you do another tour there. It's up to AFPC whether they will accept it or not.    What are the career fields that have most overseas locations (aside from combat-related fields)?   That's hard to answer. Most aircrew jobs, maintenance, SF, Comm...basically careers that are the backbone of any AF base. Intel and some of the more specialized jobs only have a few bases they can go.   And what are the OCONUS locations that you believe are the easiest to get on the first try? I heard Hawaii and Alaska were pretty hard to get to get since everybody wants them, but how about places like Turkey or Iceland? Korea seems pretty shocking since a bunch of people want that location   Korea is probably the easiest. It's not that everyone WANTS Korea, it's just that they are not the most pleasant bases, but it's a year and they get top pick. So people will suck it up for a year to say get Hawaii. Thule is probably another one that isn't pleasant, but again it's only a year. Most short tour bases though are pretty easy to get to, especially if you are already overseas. I'm in Hawaii now, and some people have come here straight out of tech school or CONUS without having to do a short tour. So it's not impossible, but most everyone coming into my unit is a short tour (mainly people coming from Korea). A group of us came from Turkey (myself included), but we have one SrA who was at FE Warren for a little over a year and get picked up to come here...how he pulled that off, I have no idea."

Also fuck you if you have more stuff than you can fit in your room, because the Army does not have storage here and won't pay for off post storage, so you have to get rid of shit before you PCS or pay out of pocket to store it stateside.

We had a SSgt PCS in. Army said ""Here's your dorm room."" We said ""ha! No fucking way. Get fucked."" It took two months of fighting, but it was finally decided at the USAFE/USAEUR level that an Army post cannot dictate to an Air Force commander how he takes care of his people, especially since your OHA is paid by the Air Force funds, not Army funds.  Of course, even if you have an Air Force chain of command and not a joint one, if they won't fight for you you're fucked anyway."

AirForce,3dcgi1,illogical_reason,9,Wed Jul 15 04:39:57 2015 UTC,"A1C Dean is informed to return to work and that you'll notify him of your decision by COB, because you don't shoot from the hip on an answer this huge to someone's future.    Time for a one-on-one discussion with SMSgt Merritt (CCF).  Subjects:    1)  Is his discharge recommendation truly rooted in failure to proceed?  Listen carefully here, the shirt has the commander's ear and you want to make sure making full use of the perspective he brings to the table.  Your concern is whether the unrelated misconduct (which wasn't cause for discharge at the time) is perhaps driving a ""cut our losses"" decision now.  Plus, has A1C Dean failed to proceed until his second CDC failure?  2)  Is TSgt Kent the right supervisor for A1C Dean?  I mean, I'm moved by MSgt Fleet and TSgt Kent's assurances that they'll do their jobs this time, but they already had one shot at this. Fleet will have to continue as CCT, but Kent needs to go.  3)  If Dean needs a new supervisor, do you have one in a new workcenter with more tasks that align with the CDC?  Dean owes you a pass on his CDCs.  He's entitled to two shots at it.  Discharging him early is premature, and should not be rooted in ""failure to progress"" until he's had his two shots.  Big Blue owed Dean proper supervision.  He didn't get it.  Make sure he gets it."
AirForce,3dcgi1,NoBlueKoolAid,6,Wed Jul 15 13:09:18 2015 UTC,"Damn, this seems like a similar case I've witnessed personlly. The circumstances are quit similar: A1C who gets test anxiety, a SSgt too caught up in her own life to care, and a small sub-sect of our AFSC not even mentioned in our CDCs. We worked in an OSS, even though we're Comm.   The solution afforded by our Lt Col Fligt Commander was to coordinate with Base Education and have him attend test anxiety classes, along with learning ""How"" to study (verbal, visual, etc). Next, we coordinated with the comm sqd so he could attend a week-long OJT session with the different sections, since he didn't have any experience with those fields before. Finally, he was put on swings, when it was less busy, so he could spend the evening in the office studying.   Ultimately, he failed his re-test. But boy did we work with him and try our best to support him. I think the Sqd. CC ended up waiving that portion of the CDCs, since we had 2 volumes and he failed the general knowledge portion."
AirForce,3dcgi1,Artfullyours,3,Wed Jul 15 05:09:16 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty common issue that you will face.  The reality is nearly everyone gets a second chance to test.  The real question is how you handle getting them from fail to pass.  So the ""LOA"" for a DUI... first off that's way low as a punishment, normally DUI is an article 15 if prosecuted on base, an LOR/UIF if prosecuted off base.  But one LOA is not enough for a punitive discharge by itself.  And using a CDC fail to kick someone out for punitive stuff is ""cheating"" by taking an easy way out, and sets you up for trouble in the future when you want to give a different kid a second shot.  Another admin note about the scenario... you'd never have this discussion in front of A1C Dean... you and the supervisors would discuss, decide a plan, then bring in A1C Dean... just FYSA.  So it seems there's a consensus that he's a nice kid but not tremendously skilled.  First off, always send failures over for reading comprehension testing and study skills classes.  You'd be surprised, sometimes dyslexia can sneak in and explain a lot.  Second the supervisor... check out the training records and look for involvement, there is supposed to be annotations made documenting training progress.  Were they there?  If not, points against supervisor.  Also grill supervisor on how they prepped the kid.  Did they provide study time?  Were Dean and Kent on the same shift even?  Also look at the training timeline... did they rush the kid to test to meet some metric (there are max timelines to achieve 5-level)?  What about pre-tests?  What scores did he get on those?  How many times did he take them before passing?  Were they quality pretests?  So based on this you can either a) get Dean a new supervisor, or b) put the pressure on TSgt Kent to perform.  Perhaps a lower ranking trainer that has more time to dedicate to him?  Then look at the proposed remedial plan... how many dedicated study hours a day?  Does he do them during his shift or after his normal shift hours?  (You can have people work extended hours for extra training)  How about a study environment, where could he study best without distractions?  Normally your UTM and supervisor will come to you with this part already ready for you to approve.  Finally, how to you deal with A1C Dean.  Sounds like it might be time to light a fire based on little motivation.  Reporting in in Service Dress without him knowing what decision you've made... grill him about what life would be like if he got kicked out... threaten to call his Mother (seriously, this can be absurdly effective at generating fear in some airmen).  Then tell him you'll give him a second chance, that you see something good in him, but that you expect him to study his butt off to pass."

If the airman and sup haven't done fuckall to prepare the student, then they both can get fucked.  If the airman was doing what he was told, then we can worry about how we might have failed him. Also, a pretest would help weed out failures, same as a mock FA.  All that said, the only CDC failure I know was immediately rehired by Department of the Air Force in her former bosses' position.

Then I'm going to have a conversation about appropriate supervision with TSgt Kent.  I would even consider moving A1C Dean under a supervisor with less personal baggage.  Not as a punishment for TSgt Kent...but to get A1C Dean the help he needs and deserves, and to take this problem child off TSgt Kent's plate until his personal life is more stable.  If he fails the CDCs a second time...it may be that A1C Dean needs to attend a TAPS class instead of a CDC study session."

If I were hypothetically a brand new Captain, I would recognize that as a commissioned officer I am paid to be the bad guy.  There is an A1C that is an adult, has made poor decisions that resulted in a DUI and has failed at his CDCs.  The Air Force doesn't need him.  Better people have been kicked out for less.  The TSgt can also be dealt with, probably in the form of a markdown on the EPR or something.  Ultimately the A1C is responsible for his actions, and if I were a hypothetical Captain, I would grow a set, listen to my SNCO's and make the tough choice.

From that point he can do all kinds of things like say ""next time Airman snuffy does X that these LOC's are for, I'll hit him with article 15 instead""  Maybe take a stripe, for example.  Or he could even say ""there's enough paperwork here to justify an admin sep package"" in which case you get a one-way-ticket to civilian below the zone.  So just as a heads up, paperwork bad.. the idea of ""I know it doesn't matter"" is false.

I had a CCM who married his wife in tech school and I think still married 30-something years later. He even got two article 15's in tech school too.  I'm surprised AETC didn't make it illegal or give an article 15 or something for getting married. Knew a LOT of people to do it to get out of the dorms after tech school, but most of those ended up working out I think so that's good. Some didn't but I remember a guy in BMT and a few others having to get permission from the BMT SQ/CC to get married on town pass, or maybe I was imaging things?"

But the thing is about tech school, as long as you give your best effort, you will pass. I don't remember seeing anyone washback/out unless they just gave up or let nerves get to their head.  And once you get operational, you are pretty much taught everything all over again with assumptions of that you have an idea of certain concepts from tech school, but you lack the details. (which is true)  It's fine to be nervous during assessments, just don't let it psyche you out. Plus, it always helps you pilot for the opposite side of the simulator you are about to be appraised in. I know you don't always get that chance, but it really helps alot in seeing how other people approach things to help you develop a method of thinking."

Stay in your strips and go through the motions.  Most of what you are doing is so different from the actual career field that you just need to get through it cause you'll relearn most of the stuff later anyway as it relates to your facility.  This is especially applicable to tower, cause you'll never really see that kind of complexity out in the wild.  Confidence issues will kill you though.  If you start getting scared and second guessing yourself you'll always be working from behind.  Just gotta stay ahead of the scenarios and at least in tech school, it's better to confidently fuck something up than quietly over thinking.

Just apply what you learn, run sims in the dorms. There's a dozen ways to get to the same outcome, all you have to do is arrive there and keep separation. Practice phraseology. Whether you're at the gym, the fishbowl, DFAC, in your room--say it over and over. Different things you learn, say it and visualize where you would say it/why you would say it. Then, when push comes to shove in the sim, you're thinking about where to put planes, not what to say to them.  I was ATC for a little over a year, washed out of Columbus AFB RAPCON during the last phase of arrival training. I loved the job, just couldn't hack it with 10+ planes doing things on my freq at once. I'm not mad I washed out though, great experience."

My skills are greatly appreciated and the normal hours are nice. Course, once I'm eligible to retrain again, I'm going to try for radar/radio maintenance or flight engineer.

AirForce,3d71bq,americanpegasus,2,Wed Jul 15 04:49:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly...  Because a 23 year old Second Lieutenant with a diploma mill bachelor's degree somehow has miraculously better cleanliness than a 23 year old A1C.     Fuck that A1C, amirite?  Let's inspect his bedroom everyday so he knows he's not a real person, like us."
AirForce,3d71bq,americanpegasus,6,Tue Jul 14 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"Most of the ones I know are.  If that A1C wants his BAH he should rank up or get himself a degree and into OTS.  Generally it's only the prior E folks with diploma mill degrees- ROTC isn't set up there, the academy is obviously not one, and OTS is so competitive  a civilian has little chance of getting in with one."

AirForce,3d71bq,msmith1172,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:12:32 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, excellent counter point.    In that case, they should be allowed, but their second Lieutenant rank insignia should have a small asterisk above it.    That only means they must have their living quarters inspected at the same frequency that airmen do.    The only reasonable alternative is to the stop inspecting airmen living quarters."
AirForce,3d71bq,pawnman99,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:02:05 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you - mandatory dorm inspections are a raw deal for most people, but I see enough dorm reports that tell me that there are lots of people who aren't ready to live on their own just yet in that grade pool (E1-E3, many of whom are <22.)   I'm not saying the same isn't true for 22 y/o 2nd Lts, but there are checksums on MOST 22 y/o 2nd lts. They've either been through the academy (so they've had 4 years of room inspections,) they've been through ROTC (so 2-4 years of military regulations and customs, or they're probably at the top of their game from the civilian sector (with selection rates < 40% with the most recent board excluded in which case their average age is >25 or so.)  If you're in the dorms, you should 'phase' out of inspections after your first xxx months or whatever. Eliminating airmen living quarters inspections is not a great idea, in my opinion - those are shared living spaces. Enforcing a standard hopefully (though maybe not always) keeps the interpersonal quarrels stemming from cleanliness to a minimum. Everyone needs to learn to keep their own house.  The reality is that, compared to married military members, those living in the dorms are getting jacked in their wallets. If I was king, everyone would get BAH and dorms would cost a real, market-adjusted rate for a shared living space. Those who wish to do so can live in the dorms - and we can eliminate half of those dorm managers operating outside their career field.  If I was junior enlisted again and I had the opportunity of living in decent dorms for ~400$ a month and pocketing the rest or living off base, I'd probably live on base - but I was clean and enjoyed the community of living on base. I also enlisted at 22 AFTER college and already knew how to do dishes."

It's an ROS saying you have equipment that is not being properly accounted for.  There can't be any liability finding in this case.  The investigation will be more along the lines of ""where did the equipment come from, why wasn't it on the inventory, how was it being accounted for if it wasn't on the inventory?""  It'll basically be a pencil-whip job.  The findings of the ROS will be more or less along the lines of ""item was delivered aprox this date, was never added to AFEMS, custodian inherited the account, identified that the equipment was not being accounted for, and initiated this ROS to resolve the problem.""  However these is Plan B to just file the serial number off, dismantle the equipment into small unrecognizable parts, and tape them under the floor tiles of some raised floor somewhere... but it sounds like your leadership already knows the equipment exists so you have to go with plan A and just do the ROS bro.  It's the right thing to do."

What is your shaving process like? I used to get a ton of ingrown hairs and razor bumps on my neck before I switched over to double edged safety razors. I got some quality shaving products like pre-shave gels, creams and aftershaves that help my skin a lot. My skin is much healthier and ingrown hairs and skin irritation are almost non existent. Just something to keep in mind to soothe your shaving pains if they won't grant you a waiver."

You might get a better shave and less irritation with a cheaper 2 blade razor. More blades = more friction. The idea behind multi blade razors is that the first blade pulls on the hair so the next blade can cut it off close the the skin. With too many blades, you might be cutting the hair under the skin, which can cause bumps and in grown hairs.  5 blades is actually pretty ridiculous. It's mostly just marketing."

Improvements in aerobic fitness occur when the activity, at the proper frequency, duration and intensity, involves a large proportion of total muscle mass, maximizes use of large muscles, (e.g., muscles around the thigh and hip), involves dynamic, rhythmic muscle contractions, and minimizes static (no movement) contraction and use of small muscles. Many modes of activity meet these requirements, to include crosscountry (Nordic) skng, running, cycling, swimming, skating, rowing, walking, aerobic dance, indoor aerobic exercise machines, and *some sports if they are continuous in nature (soccer, basketball, court sports).* (emphasis mine)  I can't find anything that really dictates what is acceptable for organized PT, only that some sports are acceptable for organized PT. As a result I would assume that you can be required to participate. Profiles excluded.  Granted i spend a cursory ~2 minutes looking through it, so i may have just missed it.

AirForce,3danav,adverseaction,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:03:57 2015 UTC,Exactly. And that's a huge problem.

AirForce,3danav,crankyrhino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:40:26 2015 UTC,New guys will get 3s because they are new.  The 5s and 4s will go to the members that have been there longer or more well known.  Soooo the longer you're there the more likely you are to have higher average eprs. Make sense?
AirForce,3danav,Kedriastral,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:06 2015 UTC,"You're likely right, but not because of some club. A 3 at a new assignment isn't a bad thing because:  1) your new commander can't really speak to what you did at your last base, even with a LOE  2) it gives you room to move up. If you start at a 5 and stagnate because you test poorly you will hold up the show for others - you have no room to move up during your time at that assignment, only down. The way the navy fixes this is they either PCS you or mark you down - doesn't look good to a board to fall backwards. Conversely, those there ahead of you in the top 5% should be looking to get promoted to free up a ranking for you  3) a 3 is now the norm. With zero discipline issues, 85% of the force will get 3s. Mathematically this makes it competitive when you play in all other WAPS factors. I wish people would really think about this and the rest of WAPS for a moment instead of getting wrapped around the axle on the whole, ""only 5% get a 5,"" point  I realize the perception will be there's some cool kids club, people will get their feelings hurt, it will now be more upsetting to miss a cutoff by a small number of points. This will probably sound like the ""party line,"" but it's ground truth: Study, study, study, and be the best Airman (capital A) and performer you can be, and promotions will come. No bullshit."
AirForce,3danav,crankyrhino,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:15:53 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree on all your points.  But I'm just trying to highlight the fact that you may have done a great great any things for 10 months and then PCS'd.  That new base will have a tough time giving you anything but a 3.  Having a known 3 on a PCS will propagate a negative stigma that a PCS can now ruin careers.  Is that true? Absolutely not.  Your comment was the most true about being the best ""capital A"" airman.... But most won't see that.   Each base knows who their 5 is before the cycle starts. And that's certainly not the new guy, even if he is the absolute best.  That was the point I was trying to make."
AirForce,3danav,Kedriastral,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:52:19 2015 UTC,"Not really, your last two EPRs from your last base also count.   No one should sit at the top ranking/strat longer than about 3 years anyway, if you do and still can't get promoted you're clogging the system for someone else."
AirForce,3danav,crankyrhino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:39:29 2015 UTC,What if it's your first promotion year? Only that new base epr will count. Certainly not ideal.
AirForce,3danav,Kedriastral,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:56:37 2015 UTC,"Take a second and think about this. In the situation you present, you're probably not TIG eligible anyway, so you'd probably get the same 3 at duty station 1 as duty station 2. Also, remember, 3 is no longer ""punitive,"" 4 and 5 only belong to top 15%, making a 3 competitive because that leaves 85% of the force left. It's simple math... If they promote more than 15%, you have a shot. They just promoted 21? 22? percent to MSgt so using that cycle 7% had a 3 somewhere.... Which under the old system was a board score killer.   You're also not a shoe-in with a 5 or 4.... You still have to take the test. Don't do well there and you won't even make board no matter what you rate on the EPR, which gives more 3s a shot."
AirForce,3danav,crankyrhino,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:52:42 2015 UTC,"If you've waited the two years you'll be tig eligible. So whatever rank, regardless of tig eligibility, will be jeopardized by a pcs.   Will it be the end all? No, certainly not.  But someone with a 5 will have an additional 60 points.   Go check your pfe and skt averages in the morning. The difference is literally another test."

AirForce,3d7ube,SouthernCrossfire,2,Wed Jul 15 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"If every rule pandered to every persons issues then there would be no rules. Having a maximum age for entrance is not because they dislike old people. Fuck the people that made that rule are old people. The military has decided that at the age of 39, you have the absolute last amount of useful life left that they can use and which warrants them paying you. Being an Airman can be physically demanding and you would also be about 45  by the time your actually smart enough to do your job.   There are two routes older people take when joining the military in my experience. The ones that go in with a bit of life experience under their belt and actually provide a useful service to their country and coworkers are the first type. These guys flourish and usually end up catching or surpassing the big mass of mediocre junior leadership.  The second type are the ones that come in, fuck around, and assume since they are older they deserve some type of professional respect, especially from younger Airmen. When they do not get that respect they turn into big ole bags of shit and bring their shop down. There are several more issues but im writing an essay at the same time as this post and my fingers hurt. If you want more personal reasons or some actual numbers why its stupid to hire people on a physical decline to a physically demanding job let me know and i will provide them for you.  I have worked with a lot of older junior Airmen, the ripe age in my opinion is 28. If it was up to me id make the age 27. Its hard enough to get the job done the way it is. The military does not exist as a crutch for people to begin their lives or redirect them or whatever. When you join you are joining to serve them, so they make the rule.  Also nobody hates older people in here. But the rule is sound, and we have way too many stupid rules to bitch about than to worry about the ones that work."
AirForce,3d7ube,Shift84,0,Wed Jul 15 03:55:06 2015 UTC,"The second type are the ones that come in, fuck around, and assume since they are older they deserve some type of professional respect, especially from younger Airmen.    Ugh, I cannot stand people like that. I can see your point here.   The ones that go in with a bit of life experience under their belt and actually provide a useful service to their country and coworkers are the first type. These guys flourish and usually end up catching or surpassing the big mass of mediocre junior leadership   This was what I was trying to get at. Not all of us want to cop an attitude.   If every rule pandered to every persons issues then there would be no rules.   But rules change because of circumstances. I'll give you an example.  Back in the day, when they decided on age to collect Social Security, they chose 65. Most people made it to maybe 66 or 67. Now people are living well into their 70s, which is draining the system - for these and other reasons some are considering raising the age at which you start to collect.   The other reason is, and I'm sure you've heard ""60 is the new 40"", etc. people are living longer and healthier.  If you were to raise the age I highly doubt you'd get a huge influx of people. Not that many at 40 feel they're up to a highly demanding position, doing all that running and yomping around obstacle courses, etc.  But I've seen people in their 50s still playing semi-pro football and hanging with guys in their 20s. People in their 90s are running marathons. We're in better shape and healthier at 40 than we were when these rules were made.  Once upon a time you couldn't serve your country if you were gay, transgender, or female. (The last, in certain capacities). We've since decided as a society, rightly, to consider merit first and foremost - if someone who calls herself Caitlin but still has a penis would make a first class airperson, we're not going to say ""you can't even try to make the grade, get out"".   Since we're re-examining all these rules, Shift84, I'm suggesting that we might want to re-examine all our assumptions. I'm not saying ""let older people in, but change the standards and give them the respect they deserve"" - in fact, if someone cops an attitude like that, smoke em til they drop out."
AirForce,3d7ube,SouthernCrossfire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:02:15 2015 UTC,"Being gay has no physical limitations it was repealed due to ethical changes in America. Social Security and retirement also have no bearing on actual work. You have to look at this from the military point of view. It's a symbiotic relationship. The military is built upon its members, and while each member is important; what is more important is the whole. If you weaken the structure enough it begins to fail. Maybe not fast or loud, but it will fail.   Imagine a brick wall, you can Crack a couple of bricks and it can still be a solid structure. But as soon as too many are damaged it will fall apart. The whole is more important. With the reduction of forces every single year, increasing the age of enlistment is going to compound this issue. Older people get sick, injured, and tired faster and more often than young people on average. So what happens if you shrink the quality and quantity of something? Your end product suffers. And believe it or not people's lives actually depend on that end product. Yes there are probably great physical specimens around that age, probably better than some younger guys. But it wouldn't just be one person in great shape.   On top of the actual work there are other issues. Medical costs are higher for older people. The US military is trying to save money not spend more.   Honestly, truly, emotionally even. Anything that could help my fellow Airman out is a +1 in my book. But I do not believe raising the enlistment age is something that will.   I will say there is always a way though. Anything can be wavered even enlistment age. You just have to be persistent, passionate, informed and worthy. I don't know how old you are now but if your tip top physical shape, passionate and willing to talk to a bunch of people and get a lot of now before a yes you could probably get in. I have seen driven people do miraculous things in the military. Not often, but enough to promise that it's possible. If you really feel like you could be an asset and your this passionate about it hit me up and I will see what I can figure out. I'm not trying to rain on your parade, I just have a massive respect for the work these guys do and tons of people don't and never will understand the difficulty of military work as easy as it may look sometimes on the outside. The American dream is built on the blood sweat and tears of these guys. As much as people talk shit about it, they can only do so because of someone else's suffrage.

This is different than accepting homosexuals because a homosexual does not identify with the opposite gender physically, therefore a homosexual male realistically can be placed with the other males at BMT. A transgender male or female, however, who believes they are actually the opposite gender....Where do you put them? A Female-to-male in the Male dorms? A Male-to-Female in the Female dorms? The penis is still there my friends. And you can't keep them in the dorm of their ""original"" gender because then you aren't acknowledging their new-found preference which could be seen as discrimination.  How long before the first transgender rape case arises where a MTF decides that suddenly she fancies a bit of vagina while 25 women are in the showers surrounding her (his) dick? And let's not act like anyone who is transgender is above such a thing - demented humans will be demented humans.  I'm not against transgender-ism, I'm against the inevitable web of confusion its going to stir up for new transgender and non-T' enlistees from BMT through to techschool. There are safety concerns, this isn't about being politically correct.   And we haven't even figured out a solid system of PT standards for non-transgender members, let alone reconfiguring the system for trans'.   7/15/2015 EDIT: Quite a few people seem to be pointing out the issues I raised but lets look at the bigger picture. Currently, BMT flights are separated by gender. Males here, females there. Why? Multiple reasons, a few being the potential verbal and physical abuse, the potential ""shenanigans"" that 2 ppl of opposite genders can get into, and the potential distractions it could pose between males and females during times when they should be focused on their duties. That said, the rules are outdated, we are adults, and realistically I feel gender separation is stupid. However, society as a whole in America hasn't even embraced the idea of unisex bathrooms publicly( because we're silly ), so as of right now we have to deal with the cards we already have. The cards we currently have present us a situation where both genders can not bunk with one another.   Thus, by introducing transgender members into the pre-enlisted military population - where a person born a woman is now bunked with men and a person born a man is now bunked with women - we are essentially bypassing the aforementioned policies regarding gender separation. If repealing the transgender ban is something people want to do, we should be looking at repealing the entire policy that prevents both genders from being put together. Because that is literally what we are doing by allowing a man to bunk with women and vice versa. My previously mentioned arguments weren't meant to shoot down the repeal, they were meant to play devils advocate and address the things that will inevitably come up in conversation later. So I'm not saying any of you are wrong, but I am saying that there are more things to be looked at than simply saying ""Transgenders are people too!"" and hopping upon a bandwagon politically correct decision without properly considering all possible outcomes. Let's address the larger issues here, if the end goal is supposed to be equality."

Stuff like this happens: https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/transgender-female-boxer-gives-female-opponent-concussion-breaks-her-eye-so  Let's also flip the script - say a FTM is placed in Male BMT dorms. She's still technically a woman - in male dorms for 2 months. If a few (now released) MTI's can find a way to have their way, 50 fresh off the bus dudes sure can, and no one outside the dorm would be the wiser.   If the whole transgender thing were more widely accepted in places outside of the military - or it was further along in its progress towards acceptance - I'd be all for it.

But for a guy who identifies as a woman, which bathroom should they use? Many people think they should use the bathroom of the sex they identify as, so his question isn't off the wall here.

AirForce,3d7ube,FleenersPeener,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:02:25 2015 UTC,They're separated by gender because that's just how it's been.  Remember homosexuality was illegal up until recently.  So sexual attraction was expected to be for the opposite sex so anything else was illegal making gender separations effectively the same as sexual attraction separation. The whole point of the separation is to not being showing off your junk to someone else who would be attracted to your sex.  So the only real solution in my opinion is complete integration while providing privacy for everyone.
AirForce,3d7ube,LowgapBro,0,Tue Jul 14 06:38:10 2015 UTC,"It's a small subset of the population who would be aroused by the opposite sex taking a dump. Most people would find that gross, regardless of whether they like that gender or not.   Reasons for the separation aside, though, it still stands that the current system is based around gender, and disregards sexual attraction as a basis for which bathroom to use. This means that gay men using the men's room fits with the current system without need for change. They are men, they use men's room. But if you believe yourself to be a different sex, then the question does pop up for whether you should use the men's because you have a penis, or the women's because you wish you didn't have a penis."

A homosexual male or female who has the gender identity he/she was born with is going to be in the same showers and living accommodations as other people with the same genitalia as them. A male identifying as female or vice versa and being with a whole bunch of people with different junk down stairs is an entirely different ball game. No matter how you feel about gender identity, the fact remains that there are going to be a lot of people who are going to be way, way against it. It's just the way it is, and I'm interested to see how they plan on addressing the problems that are going to arise.  Edit: This is assuming that a transgender person hasn't already undergone surgery/hormone therapy. I'm not saying I'm against any of this or trying to come off as transphobic here, I'm not either of those things.

There are surely trans people already in the military, who obviously just keep quiet about it and don't have anything done. This would be the natural first group to be looked at, and will probably be the poster child for why the rule should be done away with.   If the military decides to start footing the bill for those treatments, it'll require extra thought. I don't think they'll make such a drastic change at this point, though. I think they'll start with getting rid of discharges for transgender people, and not pay for that hormone therapy. That takes quite a while, I believe, so that could be viewed as an ""objective, practical impediment"". Seems like it could be an issue to deploy someone who had a requirement like that."

Even if it isn't, they will still work with you to figure out what you're dealing with and help you find a way to cope with it.   As far as what it means for your career, what you share with them (barring anything related to illegal activity or if you're deemed an immediate risk to yourself or others) is privileged information and will stay between them and you.

Put on hold any services you don't need while you're gone (cell phone, home internet, auto insurance, etc.) I suggest bringing your own pillow; you can choose to bring your own sheets and/or blanket if you want.  Knock-off Crocs for shower shoes. Flip-flops broke on me (they were cheap). Everywhere is sandy/rocky and the Crocs will make it easy to walk on.  You can make a lot of money by moving out of your house and putting your stuff in storage. Storage sheds are around $60/month and you can pocket all of your BAH.

Even if video calls over Skype don't work because of bandwidth issues, you can still make landline calls via Skype for a few cents a minute. Google Voice, voxer, WhatsApp, etc, are all other options.   Research which of your favorite vendors will ship to apo addresses. IE, Walmart will but Target won't.

But here's the kicker, one of those times they actually loaded passengers on the plane and took off. He fell asleep, woke up and thought they were landing in Japan. Turns out to not be the case, the plane had broken 45 minutes into the flight and they had to turn it back around and re-land in Hawaii.   After that he just ate the cost of a one-way ticket back.   He did love his $5 flight from Oki to Hawaii though on a C17, and we're planning some stateside hops this year to nowhere in particular.

When I first went to MEPS, I signed the first contract saying I would enlist for 4 years. A job contract arrived: however, the contract says 6 years. My recruiter (And the other recruiter in the office) confirmed that the job contracts simply come in as 6 year contracts and that I can change it back to 4 when I go down to MEPS before shipping.  They seemed aware that it would be worrying and even went so far as to say ""If you can't change it back, just dont go to basic that day"", and I've never had troubles with either of these recruiters before. They also said to think about this just as a job reservation, and not as the final contract that I'm going to sign at MEPS. I'm just a little paranoid since a big thing you hear everywhere is to get everything in writing. I signed in a few places and initialed, but didn't sign the final box that's reserved for the day before I ship out at MEPS. Anyone with similar experiences? I trust both of these recruiters, but I'm a little paranoid regardless.  I guess what I'm asking is: Can I change the enlistment length from 6 to 4 while at MEPS without having any issues? Or is the contract I signed in a few places (But not the final required boxes) just a contract to reserve my job, and I'll be able to adjust it while at MEPS before shipping out?

Because of some medical issues, my enlistment process is taking close to a year. But some people can whiz through in a couple months, each person is different. It also depends on how functional/dysfunctional your recruiter and local MEPS is.  2) Your job cannot fire you for joining the Reserves, they have to give you your job back, check out USERRA. With that said, leaving for training right after you get hired is not going to be very endearing to your employer.   3) Basic Training is 8 1/2 weeks. The length of your Tech School depends on your specific job. Depending on what you do, you could potentially be away for much longer than 5 months. Your assigned unit commander(s) will also need coordinate your BMT dates with your Tech School dates.  The two may not match up to your personal preference/time frame.  Long story short, talk to your recruiter. If this is something you reallyyy want to do, then do it, even if the time frame doesn't work out exactly like you want it to."

I have switched nearly between each one, and I have been doing so for well over a year and a half or so. I am currently a junior in high school, but figured I should really get on it this summer.  I know that the army lets you pick your exact job, rather than field, and that the best time to join is the summer before Senior year, as you get the most available jobs. My question is why is the Air Force the way to go? What personal experiences have you all had that would make you choose the Air Force rather than any other branch. Thank you so much!"

No they can't force you to take a job you don't want, you can always walk away until you're on the plane to BMT, but they can help you walk away anytime they want as well."

I also do know that an associates degree gives you automatic A1C (E-3) at the completion of BMT, base pay being around $1730 with less than two years of service. About $300 more/mo than AB (E-1). You will just need to turn in your college transcripts to a recruiter, and they'll take care of that. I also know that it is easier to go from enlisted to officer than civilian to officer, however it may take a while depending on if your AFSC will give you sufficient college credits or how many classes you'll be able to take while at your duty station/deployments."

AirForce,3d49df,wombat_pie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:49:14 2015 UTC,"Hi,  So I just graduated college a couple months ago with my BA in Political Science. Intelligence is the field I want to get into -- I've applied to many jobs, but haven't really heard back from anyone, anywhere. I've heard that it's sort of a position the government gives preferential favor to ex-military types who they know have had the training. So, as a result, I am considering the Air Force. If I don't have a job soon, I may give some serious consideration to it. But for now, I'm just investigating.  Now, my questions: Since I've graduated college, I'd want to go to OTS. Is that something they let pretty much anyone (with a degree) join? Do you have to apply? Do you pick your desired job when you sign up? How does that whole process work? It's always been my understanding that you sign up, you do boot camp, you take a test, and they assign you to whatever you scored high on.  Furthermore, does applying for OTS and finding out what you'd be able to do a commitment? Would I be bound to go to the AF if I took that test?  Can someone clarify this for me? Or do you have any tips in general about getting into intel?"
AirForce,3d49df,rei_load,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:56:22 2015 UTC,"I think I can help clear this up a little better. If intel is what you want to go for then you're going for a non-rated position. You need a GPA of at least 3.0. If not, you'll need waiver and that depends on how you score on the AFOQT.  In my experience (I've been through three different recruiters), the first thing you'll do is contact a line officer recruiter. From there they'll send you some pretty basic paperwork to see if you might qualify to be in the Air Force as an officer (drug use, criminal activity, things of that nature).   If you pass their pre screening they'll probably send you the real paperwork and set you up to take the AFOQT. There are minimum percentile scores you need for both rated and non-rated positions but they are different and I can't remember them off the top of my head.   From there you'll also gather at least 3 letters of recommendation but preferably five from people who know you well and people who are in a position such that they have had enough professional experience to really convince the board that you'd be a great Air Force Officer.   Now since you'd be going for a non rated position you wouldn't need to go to MEPS until after selection.  If all of your paperwork seems to check out and you won't need waivers (if you do, that's  a whole separate process) then you'll do the officer interview. This can be done by and officer (with the rank of O-4 or above) of your choice or through your recruiter's squadron. Now I another another poster said they did it with a Captain and then with the commander who's probably an O-5 but basically it would be the O-5 signing off on your interview because it has be from an O-4 or above (in any branch of the military, active duty or retired). I don't know anything about a first or second interview because I chose a Coast Guard O-6 that knows me very well for my interview and it only took and hour. If it's in person then dress nice like you would for a job interview and be respectful.  After the interview and paperwork are turned in then you wait for the board to meet and the results to be released. If you don't get it then you have to wait 6 months before being eligible to apply again unless you get a waiver, which are normally only granted if you've shown something significant has changed that makes your package a lot better than before.  Non-rated commitments are 4 years. Rated positions are 6 except pilot which is 10. You'd only be bound once selected for OTS, completing OTS and actually taking the oath at the end when you receive your commission once you complete your training.   You apply for intel among other jobs when you do your OTS paperwork. If your packet ranks high enough and that's your number one choice, you'll probably get it. But nothing is actually guaranteed. Also a degree in Poli Sci means pretty much all non technical jobs are open to you but obviously you need an engineering for engineering or a science degree for a science job.  So the overall process is: contact recruiter -> do paperwork and take AFOQT -> officer interview -> submit package -> get selected for a job -> go to OTS -> complete OTS and commission -> off to training and the rest of your AF career.  Check out www.airforceots.com for a ton of info."
AirForce,3d49df,MadamBeramode,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"You are required to have a college degree before you can even attempt to apply for OTS. You pick a list of jobs that you would like to get and you submit your choices to the OTS board. Rated (Flying) and Non-Rated (Not flying) are separate boards and you can not apply to both at the same time. Rated boards have higher selection chances at about 50-80%, whereas non-rated boards have about 20-30%. Intel would fall under non-rated.  Its not a simple matter of signing up and going in.   Meet with an officer recruiter if you can and they can help start the process. You need to take the AFOQT; this is not the ASVAB. This is a more difficult standardized test that will help serve as a baseline to compare you against other candidates. You can only ever take this test twice in your lifetime, so do well. You will want to get 5 letters of recommendation from people who've had authority over you, but former military works well too. Professors, teachers, bosses/managers, volunteer organizations, etc work well. After you've taken the AFOQT, you will be sent to MEPS to see if you are medically qualified to join the Air Force. You may go to MEPS before, but the AF is generally only wanting to send applicants to MEPS that are viable candidates (those who score well on the AFOQT). Fill out a bunch of paperwork with your recruiter after you've done all this and submit a package to the OTS board (which are a group of colonels). Wait for several months to see if you get in. If you fail to get in, you must wait for several months before you can reapply (essentially you have to skip the next non-rated board and apply to the one after that). There are only 2 non-rated and 2 rated boards a year.  If you are selected, you will be required to go through another physical and then given a class date and sent off to officer school in Alabama.    Note this process can take 2-3 years. It takes several months to get an application ready and submit it, then several more months to wait for a response, and after that physicals/waiting for class date.  What makes you more of an appealing candidate? High GPA, volunteer activities, leadership experience (big on this one), work experience, and your interview. The interview is done with an officer (generally a Captain) and doing well will dramatically help your chances of getting in. If you get two interviews, that's very good (not all places offer two) since it allows a higher ranking officer to see how you are.  The Air Force is the hardest branch to get into and if you join, you will be required to have a 4 year service commitment (6 to 10 for rated due to length of training). The Air Force can choose to be very picky with its candidates.  As for your understanding as you stated above, even for enlisted its test, check scores, then pick job, then boot camp in that order."

You can apply to OTS within 365 days of graduating college. So even if you're not quite there you can go ahead and get your application together and if the board submission date is within 365 days of your graduation, you can apply to it.   The interview is done with an officer (generally a Captain)   That's not supposed to happen either.

AirForce,3d49df,TRON-ALIVE,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:20:24 2015 UTC,So I got accepted to OTS but still have to do my regular and pilot physical. What did they have you do during both? I'm just curious as to what I should expect during the physicals.
AirForce,3d49df,Korist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:22:07 2015 UTC,"Regular physical (MEPS): vision exam, including color blind test. Hearing exam. Blood samples. Urine test. General physical examination (scars, hernia, hemeroids, etc), movement test (silly exercises to demonstrate you have adequate range of movement). Height and weight. Blood pressure. A lot of waiting around. Bring a book.   Flight physical:  much more blood this time. Urine test again. EKG machine. Body measurements appropriate for flight (making sure you fit, kneecaps won't hit something in an ejection, etc), vision (dilation this time) and hearing again, dental exam. Then a flight surgeon (doctor specializing in flight medicine) will give you a general physical exam.  In my experience, it was much less invasive than MEPS. She went over my medical results, then I went home.   Overall, only issues were as follows: At MEPS, my blood pressure came up super high. I don't have HBP. I get nervous with the machine, second reading comes out normal.  Flight physical: cholesterol levels were high (triglycerides I think were at 195?), but I have a family history of this. Flight med attached my previous results (dependa and college) and it was waived. Four days later, recruiter texts me with a date, report in 16.  12 more to go."
AirForce,3d49df,MadamBeramode,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"That's just a rough estimate on time as well. It takes a few months to do the paperwork and get the letters of recommendation as well as setting up an AFOQT date. Then you have to wait for scores and then set a date for MEPS. After that you have to wait for when the board actually meets and wait for about 2-3 months after a board meets to hear if you even made it in. If you have, then its more paperwork and medical stuff. After that you're stuck waiting until they give you a class date to report for duty. It can take years.  As I said above, the Air Force is the most difficult branch to get into. If you wish to serve and still be an intel officer, you could try looking at the other branches since they will be a bit easier to get into, but that's no guarantee either."
AirForce,3d49df,MadamBeramode,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"I forgot to also a step: the interview.  In my personal opinion, the interview is the most important part of your package as it allows the AF to receive a personal opinion of your character from one of their own. You will receive an interview date after you've qualified from MEPS, finished most of your paperwork, and have finished your AFOQT. A recruiter will generally only give you an interview date if they believe you are a qualified candidate with a good shot of making it through. They generally do this by your AFOQT scores.   You will generally meet with a Captain (though sometimes you can meet with a Major or higher). You will go through a very long interview process that takes place over several hours and involves a few different steps or questions that you wouldn't normally see in private sector interview. You are expected to dress for success and dress as if you were getting an interview with any Fortune 500 company (so suit and tie).   If the officer interviewing you REALLY likes you and time permits, he may recommend you to come in for a second interview with his commander (generally a lt. col). According to the Captain and my recruiter, out of 10-20 applicants they interview for a given board, he only recommended 1-3 for a 2nd interview. This is done because the higher ranking officer to sign off on your application, the better it looks to the OTS board. Same rules apply as your first interview.  My own interview with the Captain was a little over 3 hours long as he answered several of my questions about OTS and life in the AF and how he felt it compared to civilian life. I asked him numerous other questions as well, all of which he was very happy to answer and was very polite about them. At the end of the interview, he immediately recommended me for a 2nd interview and asked when I could come back in. I later came back in and met with his boss, a Lt. Col, and we talked for about 2 hours. She was a former CSO and that was the position I had listed as my first choice. We talked about the state of the AF and how family life was with a military lifestyle. We also talked about the future of the Air Force and where I believed I thought it was going (Cyberspace), which she agreed with wholeheartedly. I heard later she and the captain had given me a glowing recommendation and this was instrumental in me getting selected. This helped bring up my low GPA from college (I had a 2.8 GPA because I had dual majored).   One tip for interviews, do have a good working knowledge of current events. I follow the news from several sites around the world everday, so it was very easy for me to answer, which surprised him. He said most candidates aren't well-versed in world news and less so with the AF in the news. I commented on the B-2 bomber exercise that was taking place over South Korea due to tensions with North Korea at the time."

There are a lot of non-rated positions that you can research on your own.  You will also include a list of your top 3 or 5 (can't remember) job picks within those categories.  They will then sort all the packages by their criteria from best to worst.  Then they go down the line, and start with the first (best) person.

The first few weeks will suck, and most people don't run as much as they have you do there so that's quite rough to start.

If you live on base the AF will put you in a dorm & give you a meal card, so for the most part that 17K is pocket money.  Being married they'll let you live off base, so you'll get the $367 a month for food and $XXXX for housing (all not taxed). Housing varies because it's based on the cost of living where ever your stationed.  If you were to get stationed at Ft Meade for example, you'd get $25,416 a year in housing allowance alone as a married E1.  Here's the BAH calculator.

But, he scheduled me for the AFOQT and said that he would be contacted if my scores were good enough and then he would forward them on to the review board. I would then be contacted if there was a job available for me.  I also spoke with another Sgt, who is more familiar with officer recruiting and is the Head Line Recruiter for my state, and he told me to contact him in 1.5-2 weeks to see if there were any jobs available.  But then the proctor (I think he was a Lt) of my AFOQT said that my scores should be available in a couple days and I should contact my recruiter at that point.  So, I've decided to contact someone tomorrow. I just don't know who. I want to contact my initial recruiter since the proctor told me I should. But I also don't trust that first recruiter as much.

Still have a few questions I need to go back and have answered, but this is one I missed.  When I put down the jobs I want and the aptitude area, why is that area there? Is it for if none of my jobs being open?  Is there a time limit on waiting for a job?  Related to question 2, how rare is aircrew, specifically load or something else someone can recommend? He told me he rarely sees aircrew at all...."
AirForce,3d49df,noslipcondition,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:54:12 2015 UTC,"Once a month, the Air Force sends out a list to recruiters with all of the jobs they need filled that month. (This list has both jobs and open areas on it.) The recruiters will take the list their squadron gets, and take turns picking jobs for their recruits (using each recruits list of 10 or so jobs.)   So they will sit down with the giant master list, and all their recruits lists, and when it's their turn to pick, they try to make the best matches. It works sort of like a fantasy football draft. (Some squadrons do it differently though.)  Depending on what jobs your recruiter gets, how many other people are in your DEP waiting on a job, how long you and the other people have been waiting, how your recruiter feels that day, your recruiter's goal, and a bunch of other stuff, he will eventually book you a job or aptitude area. There is no way to know what job/area you will get or how long it will take. You could get your #1 job in 3 months, or an aptitude area next week.   Each recruiting squadron and flight has their own rules and policies for that. But for the most part, if a recruit refuses to take one of the jobs on their list, they will be DEP discharged. You can be in DEP for 12 months.  The best way to find out is just have her ask him recruiter straight up ""hey, how does this work here?"""
AirForce,3d49df,HouseOfBounce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:31:22 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a bit harsher than what I have read before, mainly about the aptitude area.  When you put the area, does he offer specific AFSCs that come across in that area? Is it expected to possibly turn those down?"
AirForce,3d49df,noslipcondition,2,Fri Jul 17 03:35:46 2015 UTC,"Haha, sorry, didn't mean to be harsh. I try to not sugar coat stuff so you aren't misled. What did your recruiter say? Because like I said, different recruiters can operate under different rules and procedures.   If you book an open area, you won't find out your job until towards the end of BMT. All you will know is that you are going ""open mechanical' (or open whatever.) You can end up with any job under the mechanical (or whatever) aptitude area. In BMT, you will be given a new list of jobs in that aptitude area that are available right now. (Your original list of 10 jobs is thrown out the window and doesn't matter at this point.) You will make a ranked list of the jobs from this list, and they will pick your job and give you whichever one they want. And that is your job."
AirForce,3d49df,HouseOfBounce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:48:33 2015 UTC,"Ah, didnt mean you being harsh as much as I meant the info being harsh.  So basically, if I list like this:  Job 1  2  3  4  5  6 (he says a list of 6)  Area-General  He can offer me either something from those 6, an open general, or any AFSC he sees from general?  I ask because I really want aircrew, but I know we always don't get what we want. I just don't want to be kicked out for denying something I really don't have any interest in doing.  I was also told going in with something like an open general is basically a surefire way to become a driver, cook, or SF, three things that don't sound very good.  He told me the biggest openings are linguists, lots of AFSCs in Electrical and Mechanical, and the rest varies. Aircrew is rare according to him and I only saw two or 3 aircrew AFSCs on his list for the month, but I don't know how ""rare"" it is and if he just really needs to fill those other slots.  I'm still just starting this process and after being out of school for over a year with no practice study got a 72 on their practice ASVAB, so I know I can improve on that, if that would impact my chances at all."
AirForce,3d49df,noslipcondition,2,Fri Jul 17 03:56:03 2015 UTC,"You are off to a good start by only having to list 6 jobs. Most people have to list 10 jobs and 1 open area. (Some have to list more!) So that's cool.  So with your example list: He can offer you jobs 1-6 or the open area. That's it. He won't offer you any random AFSCs from that open area. (I mean, he could if one has an opening, but he can't get mad or kick you out if you tell him you don't want it and it wasn't on your list.)  What I was saying in that last post is what happens after you get an open area. If you do book an open area, yes, you could get any AFSC that falls under that category. (Although he won't be the one ""giving it you,"" you will get it once you get down to BMT. And he or you won't know what job until like half way through BMT.)  Does that make sense?  Open areas seem to be getting more and more popular theses days. (Does the Air Force even have truck drivers?)  Now, here's the thing. If you list a bunch of rare jobs as 1-6, and they never ever open up, guess what? You're going to either be waiting forever, or while you're waiting your recruiter is going to give you the open area. It does seem like all the aircrew jobs are pretty rare. You should be able to list more than 6 jobs if there is anything else you think you might like. That will maybe pad your chances of booking a job you want over the open area."
AirForce,3d49df,HouseOfBounce,0,Fri Jul 17 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get you. Basically I have the area as a form of backup if I need to hop in since my ass is waiting for so long? I assume I dont HAVE to take an open contract  I figured listing a few aircrew that look good and some other stuff that looks interesting. Just gotta do some hardcore research. Funnily all the old posts on here were about aircrew being short handed. Guess that changed :/"
AirForce,3d49df,noslipcondition,2,Fri Jul 17 04:13:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. But it's not so much a back up, because your recruiter could call you this month and tell you that you booked the open area. It all depends on what the Air Force needs. Really, it's a gimmick to get you to take whatever job they need filled. (Needs of the Air Force!)  And (with my recruiter at least,) an open area is the same as a job; you have to take it if it's offered. If you turn down and open area you could be DEP discharged.  But ask your recruiter, because these things all change from recruiter to recruiter. They all have their own rules."

After I go to a university to get my Bachelor's, I am thinking about joining the Airforce.   I've read about the National Call to Service program, but I'm a little fuzzy on what my life could look like in the military.   Ideally, I would complete basic training, then training for my job in the force, right?   After this, I could reenlist on active duty for say, a 2 year contract.   I would still have time left over for my 8 year promise to my country. I could join the Peace Corps, Inactive Reserves, or Selected Reserves?   To give context, I want to travel the world. That's a large desire in life. Additionally, or more importantly, I want to work in politics. I want to be a Senator or maybe even more one day. My thought process is, if I don't have the experience and knowledge of how the military works, I won't be able to make the best decisions as a politician. In addition, when a politician has no military experience, their actions are automatically doubted since they don't know what it's like.  Do I have any information wrong?

AirForce,3d49df,FirstReactionFocus,2,Fri Jul 17 02:50:13 2015 UTC,"Just fyi, the national call to service program is pretty rare- not to discourage you or anything, but I discussed it at MEPS and with my recruiter and the overall answer was 'idk anyone who has done it so just forget about it'  Almost everyone in the airforce does 4 or 6 year contracts initially, with specialized jobs doing 10 (pilot for example).  The airforce has bases all around the world, and depending on your job/your interests, you have a fairly good chance (I would say) of getting overseas since you want to go. Just know it all comes down to needs of the airforce.  As for what your airforce career looks like->  4 or 6 year contract  You go to basic training, followed by tech school, then your initial base.   Depending on your job and other factors, you may PCS (permanent change of station) after 2-3 years at your first base. Eventually you will reach the end of your contract (or within a few months of it) and decide to re-up and go for another 4-6 or say 'no thanks' and go back to being a civilan.

If it's just you perhaps you may be able to secure lodging. We had to stay in tents and weren't allowed to eat at the chow hall. If you're an outdoorsy type of person get out and explore the place.

That's when I found that the maximum leave you could have was 120 days. When I got back from that deployment I was pretty messed up for a couple of reasons. I took 90 days of leave at once and nearly drank myself to death. Anyway, yeah...leave has weird ways of stacking up."

Stay a while and maybe you'll learn something. As far as I can see you need to socialize and get to know your enlisted counterparts MUCH more than you need a separate forum for officers, because if you alienate your enlisted coworkers like this they extremely are unlikely to forgive and forget.

Had a cancer scare that bummed me out and I wasn't as resilient as I should have been. Slacked on my cardio.   Second time, my EPR, promotion testing and leave was all on the line. Got to my 2nd from last lap (12 lap track), and my nerves were so wracked that I got sick. I stepped toward the trash can and ""stepped off"" the track. Half of my foot was. I was still within a good time but my test got terminated.   Tested at a 42 day mark and passed with an 88. I max out everything but my run.   Not that I owe you any explanation.

And recommended you attend classes for what you failed. Cardio-circuit and spin classes saved my ass in cardio. My practice tests all got faster since I did one once a week so I was allowed to test early on both occasions. I see your point, I do. And if I was a commander I wouldn't concur either if all I know about me was pt fails so close together. But I was super troop before this, and that's my only negative. All I can do is have a 1 on 1 with my commander and let him know that I would use my laziness and fails as a tool for the future. I powerlift, so fitness has always been important to me. It's just that cardio wasn't as important as deadlifting. I prioritized that and learned from my mistakes.   Trust me. There are a lot of shit bags in the AF who failed more than one pt test and it sucks ass that I'm associated with those people. So I understand the judgment. But I think I'm a pretty top notch Staff and all I can do is let the commander know that I'm not just the 2 pt fails guy.   I have another test coming up. So if this all goes through on, let's hope I don't fail the 3rd. Ha! Kidding. I won't. I swear."

Aafes is protected and doesn't have to pay state /municipality excise taxes on tobacco, which is usually about 33% of the price of cigarettes, federal taxes make up 10%. However, aafes makes up the difference and charges customers the difference if the tax, which translates to them direct profit. Sure aafes smokes are about a dime to a quarter cheaper than off base. It should cost $3.00 a pack, instead it runs about $5.60 here in oklahoma. In Alaska it was like 8.00 a pack, when it should have been $3.00 MAYBE $4.00 for the extra shipping costs."

That would be a customer savings of 1.90 but instead they only give a savings of maybe 0.25.

Inform the security forces guard you have a firearm to register.   Give the guard any information he requests.   Proceed to armory to have paperwork filled out and serial numbers copied.   Get form to be signed by commander from the armorer. Get commander to sign. Return form to armory.

If your ccaf degree is in dental equipment and you want a B.S. in finance the core credits won't transfer as well. If it's in emergency management and you want to get a b.s. In EM then it will.

AirForce,3d2mj2,thetman0,2,Mon Jul 13 02:48:41 2015 UTC,Correct. They took 40 of my tech school credits.  I already took a speech class with them (3cc) and CLEP/DSST'd the rest of my CCAF so that was 24 credits total.  Sec+ fulfilled CMIT 320 which is 3 credits. 40+3+21+3=67 credits.

I used the AU-ABC program and all my CCAF credits were accepted and I was even able to CLEP out a few more classes in my degree program.   Worked for me I guess; in my final year of BA and no debt...
AirForce,3d2mj2,DaveJr74,2,Mon Jul 13 07:01:08 2015 UTC,Is it regionally or nationally accredited? AFAIK it is one or the other.

Anyway halfway decent school will realize this when they see the transcript and just accept like 5 credits.  That being said, the purpose of your getting a CCAF will be to check that box for the Air Force.

AirForce,3d2mj2,SrABrown,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:23:23 2015 UTC,Spoken like someone who has never tried to use the CCAF. It's a regionally accredited degree. It transfers more places than you're implying. Most (if not all) state colleges fully accept it.
AirForce,3d2mj2,Joe_____,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:09:41 2015 UTC,"I took my CCAF transcripts to a local community college (in CA), they allowed 9 units worth of PE (from basic) and canned the rest claiming that military education does not transfer. Also the CCAF transcripts didn't even say what my CLEPS were, only that I had passed a few. If you have classes with another college, use their transcripts when you want to transfer. Also the CCAF associate's degree itself is not really a transferrable unless you're doing an online university/college. If you aren't planning on staying in the military a long time I'd suggest swaying away from getting a CCAF unless you really want that Airman of the Year/Quarter award or BTZ if you're still under Sra.  Other folk here have had different experiences, but this is what happened to me. And my wife was flat out told by the school she wants to go to once she gets out that CCAF won't transfer."
AirForce,3d2mj2,draykow,2,Mon Jul 13 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"The CCAF is regionally accredited which means the credits will transfer to any school, however if you want max credit from CCAF the degree you pursue needs to be in line with the CCAF credits. I have been through 2.5 years of tech schools in my 13 years in the military and have accrued 157 CCAF credits. However, when I transferred them to my undergrade they only took 60. Since then I have completed my BS and and working on my last two classes for my MBA. Zero out of pocket expense to. Are my degrees from some pretentious Ivy league school? No, but they will suffice."

Did I know the words?  Hell no.  So I improvised something like this:  This is a soooong, about planes shooting each oh-ther. Clearly writtennn  for World War Twoooo. It has nothingggg to do with our cuh-reer field. Or almost anyoneee else I know (nobody we know!)  ...I was sufficiently amused at this point to stop there.  But seriously, the song's monofocus on that group speaks volumes.  It glorifies a tiny segment of your service, and largely leaves out the contributions of the other 99.9%.  The Air Force does awesome things, but to just focus on fighter jocks?  Arrogance.  EDIT: OK so here's why the Marines Hymn is awesome...and bear in mind that I LOVE the Air Force - so many things that it gets right that my Marine Corps gets wrong...but the song ain't one of 'em.  Ours is not about some Marines from some period of time.  It's about ALL Marines from ALL periods of time.  It's about our collective values and history.  It's cocky and aggressive and affirmative.  It's about service and fighting our country's battles...not 'fame.'   </drunk>"
AirForce,3cxr1t,Rock0rSomething,3,Sun Jul 12 07:23:17 2015 UTC,"In my experience with the Marines you basically treat everyone who isn't in a combat MOS like a subhuman, so the AF ain't the only one who overly glorifies one section of the service.

Grunts are indeed afforded respect from non-combat arms guys because they are ALWAYS going to be on the x, whereas the support guys only 'sometimes' going to be there...but so many MOS find themselves in combat these days that there's nothing close to the dynamic in the aviation world where there is a sharp dividing line between the knights who ride into battle, and the squires who prep them but stay in the castle."

That is your one-time cosmetic surgery.  SOURCE: I got Lasik from the Air Force and all of this was explained to me in detail."
AirForce,3d21jl,adverseaction,2,Tue Jul 14 00:46:51 2015 UTC,"Really? When I got PRK at Andrews AFB, the doctor doing the surgery told me that the reason LASIK, LASEK, and PRK are approved is because if they deploy Airmen wearing glasses, they don't want people scrambling to find their glasses, or struggling to see, if they fall off or break. I imagine the same is true for stateside Airmen who are in an active AFSC. This makes more sense and is more plausible than ""one free cosmetic surgery.""  Having spoken to Tricare regarding my wife's cosmetic chin surgery last year, the free one-time cosmetic surgery thing is wrong and a myth. I also ran into this issue when my daughter was born with Torticollis, causing a slight deformation in the shape of her head. It's not noticeable at all with her long hair and it didn't cause any emotional or mental distress so Tricare wouldn't cover the cost of a helmet to help reshape her head. They did cover physical therapy to correct the contracted muscles in her neck and fix the Torticollis though. Basically, it's dependent on whether or not the cosmetic surgery will help fix some great emotional or mental grievance. For instance, my wife has a friend that claims Tricare paid for her breast implants. I haven't seen any claim forms validating that but at that point... it's not really my business."

Sure...how many airmen have been sucessful in running up an idea up the chain without it being squashed by an E-7 or above?  You can't change 70+ years of the military culture of ""don't question your leadership, we know best"" overnight.  I did submit something into the idea program and it was ridiculously complicated, it got shot down because the USAF had a huge surplus of a part I wanted to stop changing; it was a wire harness.  Only one connector on that harness broke all the time.  I wanted to change just that connector but because the harnesses were essentially free to the air force they saw no need to change the TO"

There are ideas that were approved, but still haven't been implemented two years, or if they were...right as they were published they were rescinded.

Maybe they don't all affect you personally, but they do have an impact.  Leadership needs to be called out on their bullshit.    Not to mention, he brings to light something that I feel is very pertinent.  If so many people agree on the way something is being handled or more often than not lately, mishandled, good leaders will take a step back to consider why so many people share this opinion.  Instead of doing that, the powers that be have chosen to try to stifle the message rather than address it.  I don't think JQP ( /u/Tony_Carr_AKA_JQP ) has a personal agenda, I think he fights for what some of us wish we could fight for.  Only someone who actually cares about the force, would continue to put forth an effort to better it."

I also happened to disagree with it, but far from silencing it, I provided a direct link to it at a blog that gets pretty solid readership, thereby porting a bunch of new readers into this subreddit to process the message for themselves.  You all tell me with your votes. If you want JQP to leave this subreddit alone and break contact, I'll move along. Plenty of other sources in my rolodex. If, on the other hand, you want this subreddit and the JQP blog to maintain a constructive dialogue that enhances the relevance of both, well... we can do that too.

As I said to SilentD in the parallel thread, this was an attempt to advance the conversation, not to trash his ideas or treat them unfairly. I linked back to the sub so folks could evaluate my analysis for themselves.   If I was a little rough this time, it wasn't intended. That should be clear from the ~150 previous articles -- including some featuring ideas from within this sub -- that found a more palatable tone. There's nothing toxic about trying to stir debate and compel change.  I will reflect -- as I always do -- on this sequence of events. I will adjust and adapt continually to do better every time I write, or at least try. To the extent I disappoint you, I own that.

It's stating where the opinion came from in order to make another opinion and see what others think.

I think the biggest problem with this new system is going to be the fact that the forced distribution is across AFSCs and the fact that only 10% of E-7s and 20% of E-8s can get have their EPRs endorsed by their senior rater (this is also across AFSCs)."
AirForce,3cx8bw,C_Obvious,2,Sat Jul 11 17:12:29 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you. I think volunteerism is overrated and forced distribution will bring nothing but bad to the enlisted force structure.

That doesn't mean they can't get promoted, it just means it will be easier for those who get the top rankings easier to get promoted.

Some of you may know who he is, but I assure you my readers do not.  On the other hand, I attach my name to everything I write and stand by it ... something else toxic personalities seldom do.

It is your responsibility to interpret his writings through your own beliefs and experiences, not to blindly follow his suggestions.

AirForce,3cvt19,pawnman99,48,Sun Jul 12 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"SF here. I've dealt with many cases like this. We take the report just like OSI or investigations will. The accused is brought in, read rights, and released to first sergeant. It's in OSIs hands from there.  The investigation is done by our S2 section (investigations) and OSI.  Mainly OSI  OSI will get to the bottom of things. It takes a hell of a lot of evidence to convict someone of sexual assault/rape. If it was ""regret sex"" they will figure it out, real quick.  Anyone that you've seen ""convicted"" and actual jail time is given you can bet your ass that person is guilty via the evidence from the investigation and the court martial.  In fact, it's more common that there isn't enough evidence to convict, at which point a person who has done some fucked up shit walks away scot free and the victim is shamed. I'm sure many of you have seen that outcome in your units.  Everyone needs to remember that unless you are a witness to the act or part of the investigation...all the ""well he said"" ""well she said"" ""well I heard from so and so"" is all hearsay or biased shit. It's easy to pick teams from the sideline but when you actually hear/respond/deal with these complaints from real people you begin to understand that sexual assault is real and an actual problem in the AF.  That being said this poster is a horrible message and probably outdated. I, along with many other cops (and I'm sure many of you), have complained in the recent years that the SAPR training needed to focus on both male and female problems and how it isn't about the gender but the act. That is why the annual SAPR training changed so much this year. A lot less ""she's drunk don't have sex with her!"" And a lot more ""this is how you deal with a person who is a victim.""   Don't assume they are lying, it's incredibly ignorant and harmful. Don't assume a dude can't get raped, at my previous duty station I actually dealt with more male on male and female on male cases than the stereotypical ""regret sex"" scenarios. I'd estimate in my 8 years in I've had hands on experience with at least 20 sexual assaults, and only one was a ""regret sex"" scenario, and she got the business for it when it came out in the open."

Guy gets touchy with girl after being intoxicated, but girl has said ""no"", guy sexually assaults girl regardless.   This poster claims that this guy wasnt able to give consent because he had been drinking, even though he was the assailant. Does this mean because he was drunk, he gets off scotch free?

AirForce,3cz52d,serendipitous-liz,7,Sun Jul 12 02:36:44 2015 UTC,"We bought in the Springs in 2013, Patrica Beck was our realtor.  I originally entered my info on www.lendingtree.com and got half a dozen calls within a few seconds. Was working through some of them for the initial education process and everything but ended up going with a local company that the realtor recommended which offered a better rate anyway, Nova  I posted the map you mentioned, and I've found it's pretty accurate. If you're at Schriever or Peterson you'll definitely want to live on the East side of town. I live in the North East part of town and it still takes 25 - 30 minutes to get to Schriever.  Starting just North of Peterson AFB and going up Marksheffel, Powers, or Peterson Road, you'll find suburbs all the way up. Some neighborhoods are a little older or newer than others, but I don't think you'd have much to worry about anywhere around that area. West of Powers things start to get quite a bit older. You can definitely see that the city has grown out to the East.  I didn't really have any lessons learned from the VA Loan process, I thought it was pretty simple. We had to hunt down some paperwork a few times, but it was nothing too difficult.  My tips overall would be:   Get a house that faces towards the South or at least East/West. If you have a North facing house, your driveway will always be in the shade of your house and you'll have a sheet of ice and have to do a lot more shoveling in the winter. Mine faces South and the snow melts off by noon most days. Sounds insignificant, but it'll save you a bunch of hassle in the winter. We have central A/C, a lot of people don't. Some days I'd definitely be uncomfortable without it. People I know that don't have it regret it. Make sure to factor utilities/HOA fees into your mortgage budget. Our utilities are around $250 - $300 in the winter, more like $170 in the summer. Will of course depend on the size/age of your house, your personal energy usage habits, etc. My house doesn't have an HOA, but a lot do, and can pay hundreds extra a month for the privilege. They usually include trash pickup and mowing your front lawn, sometimes more utilities in the fees.  I did a 15 year mortgage. Saves me $90k+ in interest, but a much higher monthly payment. If I have to move and we end up renting this place out, I won't be able to rent it for as much as my mortgage so I'll always be losing a little money on the rent. Just something else to consider since you'll likely have to move eventually and consider selling or renting it out. Most houses here seem to have basements, some finished, some unfinished. Our's was finished when we bought it and we love it. It's nice to sleep underground and not have street noise or hear neighbors, plus it stays cooler in the summer. If you or your husband are handy, you could always finish the basement while you live in it and increase the value of the home a lot by doing that, if you had a way to pay for it.    I'm no expert on home buying or anything like that, but those are some things that come to mind if I were to do it again."
AirForce,3cz52d,SilentD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! The home's facing direction is definitely something to keep in mind as we shop.  My husband and I are pretty DIY, so having to do minor finishing work doesn't scare me. The only thing that kind of bugs me is the fact a lot of house that we've looked at don't have central A/C.  That may end up being a deal breaker.  We'll be at both Peterson and Schriever, so we are looking for houses on the east end just so the drive won't be too terrible."
AirForce,3cz52d,4L0H4,4,Mon Jul 13 02:26:39 2015 UTC,"Hi Liz, I am a mortgage loan officer and have been doing VA loans for 3+ years. I was cruising through r/AirForce doing some research of my own!  A couple things off the bat I would warn you on are getting too caught up with ""Zestimates"" on Zillow. Zillow/Trulia/Redfin are all notorious in the industry as being a joke. Have Zoltan pull the actual MLS listings to get the actual value of properties. Zillow is still a great place to creep pictures and neighborhoods though!  Secondly, if you are looking at a condo, the condominium must be VA-Approved. They are becoming fewer/father in-between these days.  I would be glad to answer any questions you have - feel free to DM me."
AirForce,3cz52d,stakkar,2,Sun Jul 12 09:22:58 2015 UTC,"The feature I like on zillow are the recent sales.  It may not always have 100% of the data, but when you can see that a similar townhome down the street with the same floorplan as yours sold 2 months ago for $XXXk...   It saves us from having talk to a realtor about comps in the area :)"
AirForce,3cz52d,4L0H4,2,Sun Jul 12 14:54:04 2015 UTC,"I would be very, VERY careful with the comps on Zillow, still. Had this same discussion with my mother who is about to list her property. Zillow reported a recent sale of their neighbor's house at $365k when in reality it was $415. It's a good idea to see what types of properties are nearby, but you have to take their data with a grain of salt most times."

I found using a mortgage lending company like them made the process pretty straight forward and simple. Just have your paperwork in order and be able to explain any large lump sums of cash deposited in your account lately.(Tell em your a stripper on the side.) Once our loan was wrapped up a few months later our loan was sold to PennyMac and we've had no issues with them. Also, we used http://www.anpac.com/ for our homeowners insurance, great rates and we've since moved our vehicles to them as well and I have nothing but good things to stay about them as a company. Yes, I have had to use them for an auto claim and it was just as good as USAA/GEICO services. Look around for any military type programs in the area via realtors, sellers, mortgage lenders. A good real estate agent will know what is out there. Exampe: AZ having a large military population most realtors, lenders will end up giving you a percentage of closing cost or other funds back to you, usually like $500-$1500.  So all in all just have your paperwork ducks in a row, and look for a mortgage broker in the area as opposed to your traditional banks, credit unions."

That takes a few minutes and then you can start comparing different companies.  The company you end up going with really doesn't matter since they'll probably just sell your mortgage to another company a few weeks after you buy the house.  So just focus on the lowest fees/best interest rates.  If you plan on renting the house out vs selling it when you PCS, you probably want to do a 30 year loan.  Investment properties should focus more on cash flow and allow you to use leverage...  Plus having the cushion if your house is vacant for a month or two.   If you're set on a 15 year loan, you can always just get a 30 year and then pay extra principle each month.  Rates are low right now, take advantage of it."

My buddy and I picked up our ROTC schoalrships with a 2.9 and a 2.6 in engineering, while an awesome guy with a 3.85 in international studies had to go to the academy to get free school.  Craziness."
AirForce,3cxydk,brauski,3,Mon Jul 13 13:28:13 2015 UTC,"Simply put, it's harder to fill rated slots than non-rated.  Just finding people that are interested and medically qualified is difficult enough for the Air Force to fill its needs.  This is why OTS boards generally have a higher selection percentage, but a lower overall number of people that applied.  If you want to do something like be a test pilot, then you will need a STEM degree.  Mainly an engineering degree, but they accept applied sciences if you have certain classes."
AirForce,3cxydk,ScrewAttackThis,2,Sat Jul 11 23:05:49 2015 UTC,Why does it require only a HS diploma to fix them but a college degree to fly them?

AirForce,3cxydk,gnieboer,3,Sun Jul 12 18:53:35 2015 UTC,Why should they require a STEM degree?
AirForce,3cxydk,wafeen,3,Sat Jul 11 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I don't have an opinion either way, just curious."
AirForce,3cxydk,brauski,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"An argument would be that we're the most technical branch, and that if we had enough people applying to allow us to be that selective, it makes alot of sense.  STEM majors, especially engineers are great problem solvers, and the degree program takes alot more work and intelligence to make it thru, even with a lower GPA.  If you exclude the non-social, common sense lacking fucks, STEM majors would be superior when compared to their liberal arts brothers.  Those weird engineers are basically worthless at everything besides engineering as far as I've experienced.  Also, the AF views everyone as an investment.  Having someone technical is a better investment, as they'll beable to do anything a liberal arts guy can do, plus what their degree is.  That's why they barely give out non-tech scholarships now.  Just what I think, and I guess I'm honestly a bit biased.  #engineeringmasterrace"
AirForce,3cxydk,Skylin3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"I just graduated out of ROTC and am headed to pilot training. My degree was Aviation Management (it was an absolute cake walk and I picked it on purpose). I happened to go to field training the year before they really ratcheted up on wanting Tech Majors so I got through but these days it's hard to get accepted into the later stages of the program without a Tech Major or a pretty high GPA in a normal degree. They have rated applications now for those people who aren't Tech but want to be pilot's and so on also.  All in all, why do I need to be an engineer to fly an airplane? It wouldn't give me a leg over anyone else, and in fact I'll probably be better for it because I had time to fly and develop other areas of myself in college instead of studying away for a hard major."

I submitted my package yesterday and today the status has been updated to CFM review. So now I wait for an email.  So from what I am gathering, the CFM replaces the board all together and the current retrain process for 1B4 is:     AFPC receives the package then forwards it to the CFM. CFM reviews the package and does the interview. CFM picks and chooses who will continue. When done, CFM passes the approved packages to APFC who then see if each applicant still qualifies for retrain (retain ability, assignments, etc.).  If everything looks good, AFPC looks for a class date for the applicant."

They've been using this exact system for years and guess what? I have seen a middle-of-the-road promotion recommendation make rank. I've seen the stratification process and it's not an ass-kissing contest, it's truly about performance as a member of the military and all that entails. It's fair and unselfish and it is exactly what the air force has been crying for for the last 10 years.   OMG. We won't all be special little flowers anymore, and know something? It'll be ok.  Save the old vet stories for the VFW, they just cloud the waters here. Tell your co-worker until he knows what the fuck he's talking about he needs to shut the fuck up, enjoy retirement, and watch what happens before he opens his angry vet mouth to judge a NEW TO THE USAF system that's not even fully implemented yet."
AirForce,3csn1w,ADubs62,3,Fri Jul 10 18:51:53 2015 UTC,"This is the exact line of bullshit that was sold to a much larger USAF back in the early 90s when the 5 rating was put in to ""put a stop"" to  everyone receiving ""firewall 9s"".   Back in those days an 8 was a concern, and a 7 meant you were screwing up.  Pretty much anything lower and you couldn't even get a CJR and were most likely on your way out.  The creative writing thing was no different really in the old APR system.   It's really not a new system,  like almost every corporate rating system it has a systematic purpose, to provide a structure for force management. They aren't actually meant to benefit the individual.  It benefits the company (in this case the USAF) for times when they need to rack and stack people for retention.   These processes are force management systems, both in the corporate world and the military.  The details of how the process works does not matter, the entire purpose is to support HR (force management) decision making, mainly in weeding out bad airmen (employees) and giving the overall system a higher chance of retaining the better airmen (employees) by giving them a leg up for promotions.     This is coming from someone who, to this day (after 9 years active duty, and 19 more in the civilian world), has always struggled to fit into these systems. Eventually I learned I was a lot happier by just doing good solid work and not being a dick to people, and you'll generally get promoted anyways.  I've been a lot happier for it.   In the USAF you even have the benefit of actually testing for a substantial amount of points for promotion, unless this has changed?  This seemed to make it even easier for smart people to move up based upon individual merit.  In the big picture of your lives, don't let these systems define you or your career; there are hopefully great people and friends you are making right now, and having great experiences with your life and fun with part of your job . It might sound a bit pollyanna but doing a good job and knowing it inside, will be far more rewarding than a scrap of paper with a 5 rating on it 20 years from now.

To convince yourself the new, completely dissimilar system is bad so you can reinforce a worldview that a 3 will kill your career? Or to spot the differences and see how what this system brings to the table is better?   I can say one huge difference is this: this system depends on SNCO collaboration. Rankings and strats should not happen without it, because your enlisted leaders know you best. Comparing you with your peers in the unit by pay grade, not AFSC, ensures leaders will have to work together to fairly and objectively rack and stack everyone ahead of the SCOD."
AirForce,3csn1w,Christopherbagan,8,Fri Jul 10 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"And the old inflated system WAS about communicating who was a good performer? Then why'd everyone get a 5 and anything less was winced at? The system can be inherently flawed, but the raters themselves exacerbate it."

No, he/she probably doesn't, and they certainly don't know what their job performance is like outside of what you as the supervisor puts on the EPR.

AirForce,3csn1w,dryslot,2,Fri Jul 10 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"I've got money on /u/americanpegasus sweeping in within the first four comments telling you how if you are the best fucking Master Sergeant in the wing, you won't need to sell anything, and you should be more like him.  Because he's the best fucking Master Sergeant in the wing.  Double or nothing JQP picks it up and decries his initial rant in the final round, while simultaneously using it as a keystone in his argument about how the new eval system is already causing rustling among the ranks.  Those are my Fantasy Flightball picks for this season."

AirForce,3csn1w,MathurinTheRed,2,Fri Jul 10 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"He keeps making posts that are really long and about some controversial topic that end up at the top of the subreddit, then he makes an arse of himself in the comments."
AirForce,3csn1w,Mark_1t_8_Dude,2,Fri Jul 10 13:45:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for bringing me up to speed!
