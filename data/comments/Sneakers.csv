Edit:  i admit i jumped the gun on my comment, im sure his sobriety drastically changed the way he looks.  Drugs can make you look fat and blotted and now that hes sober it probably helped him thin out.  If you google ""eminem plastic surgery"" there is a bunch of random gossip articles about it, but no real evidence.  My bad, i took what someone told me as truth."
Sneakers,3e1m8u,Face_first,6,Tue Jul 21 13:34:24 2015 UTC,If Eminem had plastic surgery he should sue his doctor.

Sneakers,3e1m8u,phillipjpark,4,Tue Jul 21 14:45:50 2015 UTC,I won't lie it has crossed my mind as well. His look has drastically changed and im sure it's a possibility that he did have something done at some point.

Sneakers,3e1m8u,TossedRightOut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"Idk dude, I'm pretty into it. I just think that people were expecting it to be shot in the same style as season 1 and since its an anthology series, that wasn't going to be the case. honestly I've even liked Vince Vaughan"
Sneakers,3e1m8u,Saintlame,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I knew it was going to be different, I've just had a harder time getting into the characters this season and caring as much about their stories and what happens to them compared to last season. I think there's probably 1 too many main characters for them to go into the depth I'd like about the characters. I think McAdams performance has definitely been the best. Not a fan of Vaughn personally, but to each their own."
Sneakers,3e1m8u,TossedRightOut,9,Tue Jul 21 15:36:29 2015 UTC,I'll agree with you there. McAdams has been the best.   EDIT: did I mention that she's a babe?
Sneakers,3e1m8u,Saintlame,4,Tue Jul 21 16:22:11 2015 UTC,Everyone is dressed all fancy like and stuff.  Then you have Em.

Sneakers,3e0o06,ihatemakinggifs,2,Tue Jul 21 04:26:19 2015 UTC,"thanks man! Yeah I'm trying to avoid those resale prices, unfortunately an all white adidas shoe with the boost foam feels impossible at times to find.

I was watching a lot of pairs of ultra boost on eBay none I felt were worth the price though. The customizable pure boost came out and I was just like hell yeah haha. And those are nice but like you said they aren't all white. If I were you I would get exactly what you want, because if you are like me you will find something later and wish you got those instead or you'll end up with both and only wear the ones you really wanted."

Sneakers,3e0o06,bwolfs08,3,Tue Jul 21 04:41:37 2015 UTC,I have both and they are each great but the Pure Boost are insanely comfortable. When I bought the tubulars I thought they were comfortable (which they are) but the Pure Boost have blown my mind.
Sneakers,3e2oxx,CommunistAngel,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:33 2015 UTC,I use to have shoes like these (they were on sale) in high school and my friends mocked my lameness.  So weird to see them in style.

Sneakers,3e2oxx,hjklyuiop,0,Tue Jul 21 15:54:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah these definitely would not have done as well without a hyped release for sure. Link as much stuff about public opinion though, it doesn't matter I've never been the one to care what people think about a shoe, I buy what I like.   Personally I really like this shoe because it reminds me of a simple skate shoe like a classic pair of vans but then takes its styling from nike and supreme. Say what you will but nike and supreme have been making fantastic shoes for over a decade. Not saying these are on the level of like a Blazer or a SB dunk low but they are still nice and have great detailing and good materials."

JB's quality is just not what it used to be, and I got tired of Nike, except for their basketball shoes which I actually use for basketball.  I've really, really been liking adidas and Asics. Adidas has amazingly comfortable shoes in the higher end of their Boost line, and Asics has wonderful quality and are very comfortable. Also love the style a lot more as well. Don't really like how much Jordans stand out. Asics hits the sweet spot of looking high-end yet modest, being comfortable, and having noticeably good quality.  Easily my favorite brand right now."

Sneakers,3dy6w1,jhsm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:35:29 2015 UTC,"I personally think KD, Kobe, and Lebron runs a half size small because they're quite narrow. If you have narrow feet, you'll be fine. However, if you have feet that leans towards the wider side, I would recommend going up half-size, expecially these Florals due to the different material they used. KD7s are pretty true to size for the most part besides Florals. Any older KD, I had to go up half size."

Also it dries an opaque tan color and expands requiring trimming after the fact. Shoe Goo will flex and create a waterproof seal. I've used it to repair punctures, tears, and separated soles on my work boots. Also used with great results on my old sneakers and upholstery.   Don't use an epoxy or a CA (cyanoacrylate aka super glue) as these also dry rigid and will crack if flexed too much.   Shoe Goo also goes by the name of Amazing Goop which is all the same stuff. Some formulas just have additives that resist UV radiation for RV and boat applications. Can be found any pretty much any hardware store or even Walmart."

Sneakers,3dyzn2,KiwiLicker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:27 2015 UTC,"Fellow wide-footer here. Sambas lengthwise I fit 12, width wise 13 is better.  How much did you size up?"
Sneakers,3dyzn2,DJPalefaceSD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:40:26 2015 UTC,"I wear a 13 so there is no size up. It just locked me out of the V's I think, but I can find III's in a 14.  Length is good though so I don't want to go 14. Every other brand/style I wear a straight 13. Just SOL on the V's which sucks cause they are nice.  I just have to stick with Sagas. Need to try on some III's."
Sneakers,3dzhy2,DiscoInFerneau,7,Mon Jul 20 20:08:14 2015 UTC,They just started making fakes for these. Make sure to get a legit check.
Sneakers,3dzhy2,phamousman,3,Mon Jul 20 23:26:56 2015 UTC,I got them about a month ago. But what should I look for in the real ones?
Sneakers,3dzhy2,cannibal_lecter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:41 2015 UTC,"The quality of the fakes is nowhere near the quality of the real deal, and the color of the fakes is a brighter red. Based on your picture I can say with certainty that yours are legit."

Sneakers,3dzhy2,move_it1,2,Mon Jul 20 20:37:09 2015 UTC,I got mine for 150 (retail 185 I believe) and yea I'd say pretty true to size. They fit me pretty well on my normal size.

Sneakers,3dzxo2,reallynigga4lyfe,0,Tue Jul 21 14:27:58 2015 UTC,"Were on a subreddit dedicated to relatively hype/nice shoes, a lot of which are high priced, so 90 bucks isn't terrible.

Sneakers,3dydvg,Joey3270,5,Mon Jul 20 18:17:00 2015 UTC,Yeah touching the pedals is awkward if you don't hit it straight on.
Sneakers,3dydvg,roflectomy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, lol.  I got some a few months ago and I'm only just now getting used to driving in them. If I was constantly driving more than 5-10 mins, I don't think I'd ever wear them."
Sneakers,3dydvg,Guticb,2,Mon Jul 20 20:20:47 2015 UTC,Just curious... What makes them awkward to drive in?
Sneakers,3dydvg,darkpotato,3,Mon Jul 20 22:05:58 2015 UTC,The shape of the sole. The space in the middle that gives them a distinctive look leads to only being able to feel the pedal with the edges of your feet
