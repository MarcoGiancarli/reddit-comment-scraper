3DS,3dydlg,TortusW,10,Mon Jul 20 19:05:03 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you don't know, but I'll answer anyway:  The azure flute was not released through mystery gift because it was thought that it was too confusing about where to use it. So they directly distributed an Arceus instead.   http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Azure_Flute"
3DS,3dydlg,12ihaveamac,5,Mon Jul 20 23:56:22 2015 UTC,"How was that confusing...? Am I missing something?  You acquire the flute from the mart as per usual with an event item. You must have beat the Elite 4, climb to the top of Mt Coronet and you'll be prompted to use the flute once you arrive at Spear Pillar. Arceus awaits atop the stairs that appear. Simple as hell.   Edit: Unless no description was supplied to players at release. Then that would be a bit confusing. But a little message with the Mystery Gift, or said by the deliveryman, would resolve this easily..."
3DS,3dydlg,scaryisntit,2,Tue Jul 21 01:21:15 2015 UTC,But how would you know that you need to go to Spear Pillar to use it?

3DS,3dydlg,Frem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:43:35 2015 UTC,It started the month before ORAS and ended either the week of launch or week after. The purpose was to get it on XY and trade it to ORAS to get the Mega Stone.

3DS,3dydlg,trulyfascinating,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:34 2015 UTC,Only reason I ever had a Jirachi was because of that colosseum bonus disk. The number of times I had to boot that thing up for friends who wanted one as well...

3DS,3e0g81,jab011,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:03 2015 UTC,I would recommend it only if you can't get Rayman Origins on any other platform.  I'd also recommend Rayman 3D. It's an unpolished port of a 16 year old game but the gameplay still holds up pretty well.
3DS,3e0g81,blalien,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:49 2015 UTC,I've never played a Rayman game before. Would it be more worth it to get Rayman 3D or Origins?

3DS,3e0o4w,Katalos,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"To contribute a game you'd probably never play if it weren't for happening to see a good review....Style Savvy Trendsetters. I'd seen it mentioned a couple of times (always with rave reviews, including one by a highly enthusiastic 21-year-old male) which intrigued me since it looks like such shovelware. I finally caved and got it last week and all the reviews were accurate - it's a quality game that can be pretty addictive, with amazing graphics and plenty of content (it's the largest game on my wholly digital system by far - unsurprising since it has over 12,000 items of clothing). It's a business sim where you run your own fashion boutique - purchasing inventory, individually servicing customers by outfitting them according to their requests, remodeling your store/apartment and entering style contests (where you're given a theme, pick a model, dress them, customize their makeup and hairstyles, and have them walk the runway) to become the most successful stylist in the world. You unlock new venues and features in the town you live in along the way, get to go out on outings with NPCs, and all of this evolves with the seasons. I really have to stress how great the attention to detail is with the clothing, makeup and hairstyles which appeal to all fashion styles - this is a very visually appealing game, and the hundreds of NPCs will all charm you with their very realistic mannerisms. The demo on the eShop doesn't feature any of the depth of the game, but it could still be worth checking out to get a sense of the graphics involved. It's a very relaxing game that's just nice to pick up once in a while (or, you know, every day...)."

3DS,3e0o4w,DalvaMozzerX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:43 2015 UTC,There's criticisms about this game but often what I see is a lack of understanding how to play. An example is when an enemy is in over watch you can still look around to aim/shoot without moving to prevent their attack. This is critical to game play.

I've never been a huge Metroid fan but one of the things that stuck out to me when I played Metroid Prime Hunters was how amazingly fun the different hunters were and how much fun it was to play as them in multiplayer.  Even if only Sylux is part of the main story, it would be a good idea imo to bring the rest of the hunters back (alone with possibly a couple more), samus, and the federation force just for multiplayer combat and have it be its own thing, just like Blast Ball."
3DS,3dzk4r,Kavvybop,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:47 2015 UTC,It's basically monster hunter with metroid isn't it?  I think it's at least worth trying.

3DS,3dzk4r,Azerkablam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:19 2015 UTC,"Gonna counter this by saying that Super Metroid as the better game (opinion, of course). I found the bosses in Fusion to be extremely cheap as their only difficulty was how much energy they took off (1/2 to 2 energy tanks in one hit). It was also infuriating that the X parasites that heal you fly around the room and disappear before you can grab them a lot of the time. On top of that, the yellow ones, which are most common even at the end of the game, only heal 10 energy. Makes it a pain in the ass to recover lost health. Those reasons, plus the linearity, make it one of my least favorite Metroid games."

3DS,3dzk4r,Kratos4Ever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:15:44 2015 UTC,Well that's a bit of a strawman's argument. Metroid has a very definitive style and an even more iconic main character. This game embodies none of that. I understand why fans are frustrated.
3DS,3dzk4r,DrTitanium,0,Tue Jul 21 01:48:56 2015 UTC,Metroid does. Metroid Prime does not.
3DS,3dzk4r,pion3435,0,Tue Jul 21 11:41:51 2015 UTC,"It's pretty obvious that a NES game is going to be different two generations later. There are universal themes across all the previous Metroid games. A focus on solo-play, a feeling of loneliness in an abandoned environment against waves of enemies. Samus Aran is also the constant in all of this. These aren't features represented by the new game.  I totally agree that Prime is different from the 2D games but then Super Metroid is different to the NES original too. After so many Prime games as well they've established a clear gameplay style with its own distinct features (FPS, scanning, targeting).   I'm willing to give it a go but let's call a spade a spade; if this was true to the Metroid spirit, it would be included in a new single player Samus-focused game with this as a multiplayer aside. The reality is that this was an opportunity for a new IP but probably fits a marketing angle better for easy sales over any real belonging in the Metroid gaming library."
3DS,3dzk4r,DrTitanium,2,Tue Jul 21 11:59:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm fairly certain this game would have had a much warmer, or at least more open minded reception if it didn't have the Metroid Prime name attached to it."

Ive bought MH3 as my first time experiencing the franchise and it was to much for me. But once i got bought MH4 i got really into the game and i feel like i got my moneys worth even though im not G-rank or whatever.   i still like to go back and fight a dragon or what not but to constantly buying a MH and having the grindfest always lingering. it kinda makes it a chore imo.  it was a fun series.

I could argue that it was worth a lot of cash because of the software on there, the documents and blueprints, the unpublished specs on new parts.  And that was as far as I got. The SFPD and the suburb I found the laptop traced to said that they couldn't get the IP-->Real address from the ISP without a subpoena which they said for something only worth 2k would not be worth it.

Last, put the wodka on some qtips and clean whatever spots may still be sticky.

Do the benefits of the new system make it worth the money?  Where are you from? The N3DS has XL/LL versions in every region. But the XL/LL versions don't have swappable faceplates.  Only the small N3DS has removable faceplates but it's only available in PAL regions or Japan.

The cross in the title is inside a square/diamond shape, resulting in this square being split into 4 tinier squares by the cross in the middle.

The combat for one is significantly more engaging IMO since it isn't turn-based like Pokemon. You have 3 Youkai to manage in battle at a time but you have 6 on the wheel you can rotate in and out during combat so it can be very hectic at times.

3DS,3e0vwx,Romiress,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:37:48 2015 UTC,"""but this game still provides an entertaining experience in offline mode.""    This is what I'm talking about. The game is about cleaning stars for dust which you pay the guy to collect treasures. The ""stars"" are wi-fi signals the game picks up from the outside world. So, shouldn't the game still be able to pick up outside wi-fi since the 3ds can pick up outside wi-fi? I guess that's what I want to know. I'm not exactly sure how the game works regarding this. I understand that the part of the game that connected to the discontinued Nintendo wi-fi (the part that would let you connect to the website and would let you download extra stuff) doesn't work anymore but is that also affecting the main gameplay of picking up outside wi-fi signals and collecting them for trade-in in game for the treasures."

Takes to long to scan, freezes up, won't recover much and just sucks (no offense to the person who posted the suggestion)   My gf's cousin showed me a program called recova (I'm on mobile and might have spelled the name of the program wrong. If I did, tell me and when I get home I'll turn on my computer and get the right spelling) and it works amazing. It's free, gets anything and everything and is easy to use."

3DS,3e15wk,khaeen,6,Tue Jul 21 04:00:23 2015 UTC,"My comment from another recent FL post:    ""The plot in Fantasy Life serves basically only one purpose, and that is to open up new areas for exploration. People go into FL expecting a normal, story-driven RPG and that's just not the point of the game. The story is not great, and it's not meant to be great. Your chosen ""life"" is also not really meant to be relevant to the plot.  To really enjoy the game, I would recommend starting with the gathering classes - Miner, Woodcutter, Angler. Once you've experienced these lives, you'll always be able to gather materials while out questing regardless of whether you've switched to a different life. Doing so will allow you to gather more materials to use once you start the Artisan classes like Tailor, Cook, etc.  There's no perfect way to play FL, and for me that was a lot of the appeal. All the Lives are available to you from the start, and you can for the most part do what you want when you want. If you go into expecting a traditional RPG that is plot driven (I beat one area, more arts/skills/abilities are opened up, I go to the next area) you will probably remain disappointed.  EDIT: Sorry I came off like such a dick. I just see this criticism a lot, and it generally stems from people having the wrong sort of expectations.  EDIT: Don't try to smash through the story - it kind of ruins the appeal of the game. Take time to explore and advance Lives with each new area you open up.""  So basically, you're still trying to play the game the wrong way.  The point isn't to get to the DLC as quickly as possible.  That's just going to lead to the same type of disappointment you're feeling now.  Some people just don't like the game though, and that's okay."
3DS,3e15wk,jab011,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:41:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand at all. I like the game, I completely understand how it works. I want to actually be able to move on without being told that I should be grinding worthless xp for thirty levels. Don't tell me I'm playing wrong because I don't want to be wandering around aimlessly doing busy work for Lifes that I don't care for. I have close to 40 hours just into this save, I'm not here to be told that I need to spend another 40 doing stuff that gets me no closer to Origin Island."
3DS,3e15wk,jab011,6,Tue Jul 21 14:20:50 2015 UTC,"In that case, then no, there are no ""tricks"" that allow you gain 30 levels without actually doing anything.  And I don't know why you're lashing out at me like I set the level 50 restriction on Origin Island.  Geesh, ya try to help a guy...."

3DS,3e15wk,WafflCopterz,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:46 2015 UTC,Telling me that I'm not playing the game correctly and copy pasting a spiel from another post that I've already seen does absolutely nothing for me. The majority of tasks for Lifes are the ones in the beginning that give pretty much no exp but require a lot of busy work in order to complete. My whole post is about the fact that I don't want to just aimlessly wander around doing the busy work instead of having my time spent in the game being doing something meaningful that actually progresses my character as a whole. Absolutely nothing in your post addresses my question and simply berates me for not wanting to do noob work that gives no exp for hours when I don't particularly care about doing stuff like the carpenter Life. You didn't help me at all because all you did was tell me that I don't understand how to play a game that I've already put almost 40 hours into.
3DS,3e15wk,Romiress,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:03 2015 UTC,"Why the hell do you play the game? To bum rush through it without experiencing it?  For you to have beaten the story around level 20 means that you're not taking your time, not exploring and leveling up Lifes independantly of the story.  Every Life is a story in itself, the main storyline sucks in comparison to the side stories.  Stop getting all defensive because you're playing the game wrong. You seem to think the destination is the fun of this game, but it's not, it's the journey."

3DS,3e0ojr,xness151x,-2,Tue Jul 21 01:33:35 2015 UTC,MAC addresses are like social security numbers for internet accessible devices. You can't change it.
3DS,3e0ojr,SoftwareJunkie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:02:35 2015 UTC,"You got the right idea, but it's far from impossible to change MAC addresses on devices. For example, the Xbox 360 had the option to specify a custom MAC address and spoofing programs exist on android and PC. Just because the 3DS might not support changing the MAC address doesn't mean it isn't possible."
3DS,3e0ojr,khaeen,7,Tue Jul 21 03:43:16 2015 UTC,MAC addresses are assigned by a company from a pool they pay for when the device is created. The methods you describe are not actual changes. Spoofing a MAC address is not the same as changing a MAC address.
3DS,3e0ojr,SoftwareJunkie,2,Tue Jul 21 04:09:21 2015 UTC,For all intents and purposes it is. I have a laptop running Linux that hasn't used it's system's MAC address in over a year. It doesn't matter what the Nic card reports when everything else ignores it.
3DS,3e0ojr,khaeen,0,Tue Jul 21 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"You still aren't changing the actual MAC address of the hardware, you're using a workaround or hack to make it look like the MAC address is something different.  If you stop using those tools the MAC address will be back to what is built into the hardware.    If I get a fake ID that says my name is Beefpants81 instead of Porkpants81 that doesn't legally change my name to Beefpants81, as far as you're concerned my name is Beefpants81, but when I stop using my fake ID my name will be Porkpants81."
3DS,3e0ojr,Porkpants81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:06 2015 UTC,"That's really irrelevant. Nobody gives a shit what your hardware says it is because literally the only thing that matters is what other devices see it as. The Xbox 360 reports itself as whatever you want it to be, no work around, no hack(it's in the damn settings). This is besides the fact that you can indeed change the Nics address completely if you know what you are doing because it had to be set for the card in the first place."
3DS,3e0ojr,khaeen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:43 2015 UTC,"You're right it is irrelevant, my point was simply stating that you are not changing the actual address.  You're giving your hardware nicknames.  People can call me Bob, Jim, Robert, Asshole, whatever but it doesn't change my name.  Obviously I understand that there are ways to change things that are set, we all know in today's technological society that nothing is permanent or secure."

3DS,3dz0du,planetarial,9,Mon Jul 20 18:22:00 2015 UTC,"I got the game knowing it wasn't a proper Harvest Moon game and treated it as a new and different game altogether. But even without comparisons it is still a rubbish game. It is very slow to get anywhere, there's no villages to visit (people come to your house) and it is just boring. I like the blocky minecraft feel to the landscape and the terraforming, but that's it. I have tried to tough it out to see if it got better, but after 10 hours I gave up and traded it in. I usually put 200+ hours into games like this so for me this was a big failure."

3DS,3dz0du,_Ariana_Grande_,4,Mon Jul 20 19:50:26 2015 UTC,"A half finished game with a lot of lost potential. Even if it is not ""officially"" Harvest Moon, I was looking forward to some competition in a genre that can feel stagnant. The locked seasons was a cool addition in my opinion but poorly handled (and buggy). The terraforming farm was a great idea but totally wasted. Way too much space for no benefit. It would have been really cool if the game had an option to build the villagers homes in the valley wherever you wanted, rather than have them wander around aimlessly. I like the gift less romancing but thought it could have been much better. I just get annoyed at having to bother with gifts evvverrryyy dayyyyy in the previous titles. Doing favors makes more sense with maybe gifts being tied to events or something else or otherwise somehow limited. The art was uninspired and the characters super dull. I put the game down before reaching tool upgrades, so I'm uncertain if they exist in the game, which is a travesty with all the space they give. The credits rolled for the ""end of game"" before any time passed at all and there was barely any real differentiation between days especially as seasons dragged on longer than seasons are normally supposed to."

My only hesitation when recommending it in this case is that you can't do any of the story quests that unlock new areas in co-op. I don't think you can do the quests that unlock new classes in co-op, either.  That said, those things are a tiny fraction of the game, and you can skip most of each class unlock quest/tutorial.

You can play through the entire campaign that way!  Another one is LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues. You have to play through a little tutorial, and then you can find a little shop where you can have a player join your game. Requires two cartridges however.   Diddy Kong Racing DS is one of the most fleshed out multiplayer games on the DS, everything from single player is accessible via single card play, however I'd recommend going through the campaign a bit to unlock some levels."

However, while you'll be able to redownload all your games, your save data is gone unless you have some save data on an SD card then you can transfer it, but your Mii collection and streetpasses are probably gone. Ask Nintendo about it but most likely those are gone.  So, NNID transfer means:  Save Data, Mii Collection, StreetPass Data (most likely) gone  Can redownload games no problem.  Again, call Nintendo and verify but IIRC that is how it works."

However in the small chance it does matter and you get caught breaking a NDA agreement can be harsh. Bring a book.

The last thing a movie producer/studio wants is to have anything leaked about the movie that they aren't in control of.  Bringing a 3DS that obviously has a camera on it would be one of the stupidest things you could do if you have any desire to actually do this job.

Make sure you DONT do that. When you do the system transfer, it will transfer your Nintendo ID with all your eshop purchases. If you do link your Nintendo ID manually by mistake, you'll have to contact nintendo for them to fix it."

3DS,3dw37p,gordallott,8,Mon Jul 20 07:53:06 2015 UTC,"You never just ""translate"" the text unless you're an absolute amateur - the Ace Attorney series in particular goes to huuuge lengths to localize. First you translate every single itty bitty little line - save messages, item descriptions, character profiles, inspection messages, and, you know, all the actual text, then you check that translation, then you localize it - every character needs a distinct voice that shines through when they talk, their references need to make sense, their jokes and names funny, and it must all flow, then you check that, then you check it again, then you give it to your bosses who tell you to change this and this and this, so you go back and repeat the previous processes until your bosses are happy.  Then you insert all the text, line by line, which will no doubt completely break the game at some point, such as text scrolling too much, showing up at the wrong time, or just cause the game to crash (this happens a lot more than you think). So you fix all this, meanwhile someone has to fix up all the art so the text is in English and makes sense with the mystery (such as writing in blood), and inserting this art will also cause problems so you fix that. Then you have to get in contact with voice actors to do the shouts, cutscenes, and other voiced portions, and insert this (which may also cause problems).  Then you have to run everything by your bosses who tell you to change even more stuff so you repeat everything. Then it has to be sent off to the ESRB, and then you may end up having to edit more to get the rating your bosses want. Then you have to triple check everything again, and then once more for good measure, because if you don't, something WILL be wrong, and even still there might be some tiny little detail that slips through a crack."

3DS,3dw37p,de4thmachine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:16:44 2015 UTC,"Hahah, yeah. I recently started playing this franchise and according to my 3DS, I put ~81 hours on AA trilogy, ~24 hours on Miles Edgeworth investigations, ~25 hours on Apollo Justice and now I have put 19 hours in Dual Destinies (and I still have 3 episodes left). So basically each episode took around 5-6 hours.  It's like localizing an entire book! Not to mention the games even have references to pop-culture (for example the shark tornado movie reference in Dual Destinies), so I'm pretty sure they specifically localize these things according to the region, too. This obviously means that it's not just a simple job of translating the sentences. Everything needs to ""make sense"" for the player (jokes, etc) and often jokes don't translate well to other languages, so they need to think of alternative ways to express them. No doubt that's a lot of work!"

Easy application and easy pull-off if you need to take off some dust somewhere, and 3D isn't tampered with.  Protective cases... do you want actual casing or just to put it into a case? The HORI TPU protector is generally recommended for light falls and scratches, but if you want something like a shell for hard impact, there's generally not much variance in hard crystal shells. There's the Nerf hardcase, but I'm not sure if they make that for the N3DSXL yet, and I hear they scratch the system. There's also grips that cover the entire system.  The largest micro SD that will fit without formatting is 32GB. Anything above needs to be formatted to FAT32.  For myself, I have the HORI TPU protector and screen protectors, and I would vouch for them. I also take care of my system, so it still looks like day 1 when I took it out the box. I also bought a Sony Class 10 32GB micro SD. I use an Ace Attorney soft pouch I bought on Amazon to carry it around, and it works wonderfully."
3DS,3e01qf,Sairyn_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:25:18 2015 UTC,"I'm asking about large SD cards because I hope to only own Alpha Saphire as a physical game, and purchase the rest of the ones I want on the Nintendo store. Would reformatting them to ""FAT32"" limit the size to 32GB anyway?  I'm also asking about the casing because I wasn't a big fan of the color selection for the N3DS XL. I've chosen black but I find it a bit stale, mostly because my DSLite was black too. The case doesn't actually have to be exceptionally protective to be honest, so long as it moderately protects the 3DS and revamps its color-scheme.  For now I'm just getting those screens you mentioned (HORI?) and the USB charger. Feel free to share any other ""quality of life"" accessories like that that I might like."
3DS,3e01qf,Sairyn_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:50 2015 UTC,"In that case, you can get as big of a micro SD as you want. No, reformatting them to FAT32 doesn't mean it'll be limited to 32GB of space. It'll still have whatever amount you purchased, like 64GB reformatted to FAT32 will still have 64GB of space for you to use.  Maybe you'd be interested in decals for your N3DS to liven it up? Quite a few people have them on their systems here. The HORI TPU protector won't revamp the color scheme, but for me, it's been good in terms of no scratches and (one) light fall onto a matted floor. If you're not into decals and don't want something extremely intrusive, the only other thing I can think of is the hard crystal shells with designs on them. I'm personally not fond of those because I've had my other gadgets scratched by them in the past, and if there isn't any padding on the inside, they'll still likely make a break to where the system falls. But again, this is my own experience with them.  I'd also get another stylus pack (or at least just one stylus) if you can. Some people say after some time using the stylus in the actual system, it gets loose and doesn't stay in anymore. I keep another 3DS stylus in my soft pouch pocket in case I want to use it instead of the one in my system."

The rice should absorb any water remaining in the system. I would leave it in there for 24-48 hours (I think I left mine in for 48 and it was back to normal when I took it out) before trying to make it work again.   I can't promise this will work for your system (if it's been a few days and it's still not working that's not a great sign) but it's worth a try."

Unless you opened the whole thing up there's no way it was dry on the inside.  At that point pretty much your only option would be to send it to Nintendo to get fixed, but I'm guessing you don't want to do that because of the signature.

3DS,3dxu4r,Gaseous,2,Mon Jul 20 15:14:32 2015 UTC,Rain isn't usually an issue with electronics as long as they are off and you let them dry for at least a day. I've even seen laptops take the rain for a full day while in sleep mode. Worst thing that would likely happen is that you get moisture under the screen and it gets blurred.

3DS,3dufz5,Darqon,3,Mon Jul 20 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that would have to mean one player controlling two of the three Links. Guess they weren't a fan of the asymmetry there, which makes some sense."
3DS,3dufz5,ChezMere,10,Mon Jul 20 00:37:00 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sure it's the asymmetry that they don't like, which creatively makes sense to leave out. But it affects the functionality of the game too much to not include it. Plus I'm not sure it would work out that way of one player controlling two Links, I think the single player works more that you can switch between them if it's like Four Swords Adventures. So they should just let 2 players switch between 3 Links.  Every thread I see about this game on Reddit and other sites have same comments: ""I was looking forward to playing this with my SO/friend/brother but I guess we'll skip this game"" or something to that degree.  I'm lucky in that I have 2 friends who are Zelda fans and own a 3DS so I just need to buy a copy to play with them, but a lot of other people don't have that.  Hell, the guy in the interview is literally telling the guy with a wife to go find a 3rd wheel to play with them."

But our initial fumbling attempts at playing the game were all voice. Eventually one of us said, oh cool look what these buttons do. And then we legitimately used them for most of everything! Even giving each other positive reinforcement by saying 'yeah!' and stuff. It was cool.  However, the emotes will only work if the other person is familiar with how the game works. If I've never played before and I see some thing that pops up and says 'Item' over and over I am going to be confused.  I'm still very excited for this game though, and I suspect the emotes will be great for playing with people in other languages.  Is there a 2 player local with one internet?

The free shipping option isn't there if you start with a game that's already below $35 before the GCU discount."

Wind Waker HD went on sale for just over $40, and the price after GCU was $32.79.  The total sale price was over $35 because of tax.  Most sites won't give free shipping on something like that, but BB.com did.  It helped me out because the site was doing weird things that wouldn't allow me to choose in store pickup.  Something you might want to pay attention to."

I like going to the store because even with the GCU sometimes price-matched items are still cheaper.  Like when FRY's had Codename STEAM for $19.99 it was significantly cheaper than the $8 saved through GCU."

Figuring out what to do is pretty hard to find but it's pretty simple:   Turn off the wifi on your 3DS Open up System Preferences and select Sharing From the pull-down menu ""Share your connection from"" select your source (e.g. USB Ethernet) and check ""Wi-Fi"". Click the button Wi-Fi options and make sure the Network Name is ""attwifi"" Next open up Terminal. It's located in the Utilities sub-folder with all your applications. If you have the MAC address of a Spotpass location you want to spoof, type into the command line minus the quotation marks ""sudo ifconfig en0 ether "" and then paste in the MAC address. It should look like this: 00:25:9C:52:1C:6A. Press enter and enter your the password for the main account on the computer. Pull out the ethernet connection from your computer and reinsert after a couple seconds. If your wifi signal is showing on your menu bar, it should have changed from the radiating lines into an arrow pointing up. That means you're now a router with the name ""attwifi"" Turn on the wifi on your 3DS and you should get the blinking green light after a few seconds.   And that's it!"

It runs them, PSP could run them (though not very well)  The issue is one of 2 things:   Emulation accuracy just isn't good enough for Nintendo's standard They're withholding SNES intentionally for Wii U, or to drop later.   However they seem to think that metering out virtual console titles is a good thing that keeps interest up, when all it ACTUALLY does is keep the library thin.  These COULD be real retro gaming machines, with huge back catalogs (far easier for Nintendo than Sony, since they have the strongest 1st party catalog around)"
3DS,3dttp7,a_bit_of_byte,18,Sun Jul 19 13:20:38 2015 UTC,"Those arguments kill me. I also won't accept the whole ""the quality of emulation isn't up to Nintendo's standard"" argument. They made the systems. They have tons of talented programmers. Emulators that work perfectly for 99% of games are built in the spare time of some dedicated developers. If Nintendo has complete access to the hardware specs and has the development resources, the reason they're holding out on us is business related entirely. Not technical."
3DS,3dttp7,_Rand_,9,Sun Jul 19 13:33:14 2015 UTC,"Microsoft have managed to emulate the Xbox 360 on Xbox One (granted the system is a tad more complicated than standard one fits most emulators) and the 360 is vastly more complicated/powerful than the SNES, N64 and even Gamecube and Wii.  If they can manage that in one generation newer (and not THAT much more powerful of one either) Nintendo sure as hell can bring GBA and SNES to the new 3DS."
3DS,3dttp7,FasterThanTW,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:52:57 2015 UTC,"Early indicators are that the 360 on Xbox One emulator is hit or miss depending on the game, and there are a decent amount of games that don't work at all such as multi disc games"

My point was though, Microsoft has done some pretty amazing shit there, Nintendo could too if they wanted, but they seem content to dole out software in small amounts and segregate unnecessarily.  There is no reason we shouldn't have cross play like PS3/PS4/Vita and have, say gameboy games on Wii U as well as DS, and SNES on DS etc."
3DS,3dttp7,dizzyzane_,0,Sun Jul 19 20:38:00 2015 UTC,"The main reason that they're able to run the 360 on the One is because most games are designed to be portable and easily ported between the PC, PS3 and 360.

3DS,3dttp7,undescript,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:08:08 2015 UTC,It depends on what firmware the PSP is on. For example some can get permanent cfw but mine resets to regular every time I restart the system.
3DS,3dttp7,whizzer0,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:56:28 2015 UTC,It has to do with running the games and running the home screen in suspension. With their standards they need to be able to suspend the game to home screen and back and save states.

3DS,3dttp7,whizzer0,7,Sun Jul 19 23:28:47 2015 UTC,"Those games aren't emulated, they run by simulation.  The processor that's usually responsible for background functions downclocks to the point where's it's essentially a GBA.  Because of this, they're fundamentally unable to take advantage of all of the good things that regular VC titles offer, like save states, wireless local multiplayer, or even sleep mode.  But the point is, this is a completely different standard than emulation."
3DS,3dttp7,He_Himself,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:40:02 2015 UTC,"But presented to the user, it's essentially the same thing. Nintendo's standards likely don't include suspension if absolutely necessary."

As for SNES, there's probably more to it than visuals. As you saw with SSFII, it had some trouble rendering the fighter sprites."
3DS,3dttp7,terminamorte,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:08:18 2015 UTC,Not to start a fight but why do you think that the Nintendo programmers would necessarily be able to get any more processing power out of the hardware?

3DS,3dttp7,WobbleTheHutt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:19:08 2015 UTC,Last I had checked in on Blargsnes (Around the time of 1.3) they were pushing the limits of the 3DS hardware just to get a solid 60FPS emulation with no frameskip. They are already using GPU acceleration and all of the CPU available IIRC.  So on the New 3DS? Possibly. On the og 3DS? Most likely not.

3DS,3dwccm,kamanashi,5,Mon Jul 20 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"I have both of them.  Mirror of Fate is more of a ""modern"" Castlevania in that it's full of God of War style Button Press points and the level design is a bit dull. The basic gameplay of Mirror of Fate is a throw back to ""Classic"" Castlevania games like Castlevania Adventure, or the first four games. People forget that Symphony of the Night was the first Castlevania game to be more ""exploration"" based and that almost all of the games before it were more straightforward in terms of how they played. The story is a mess and the game also has some weird difficulty spikes out of nowhere.  Code of Princess has some good music, but the art style in the game is poor and the gameplay comes off as being very repetitive. The story is okay and the localization is fine. If you liked Senran Kagura Burst, Double Dragon Neon, or other ""modern"" beat-em ups, Code of Princess is indeed that. You're just going to be playing through the same levels over and over again with different characters to level them up to survive later fights. It's not particularly difficult but it is one of the weaker beat-em ups on the 3DS. Which, honestly, isn't a terrible thing to be. The 3DS is a system where you can digitally purchase: Double Dragon 1 & 2, Mighty Final Fight, River City Ransom, and Streets of Rage 1 & 2. Those are, generally, considered to be the best beat-em ups of all time. So, Code of Princess commits the sin of being an okay game on a system with a glut of brilliant games.  Between the two, I would pick up Code of Princess because it's a game I've spent much more time with. Mirror of Fate is okay but don't go into expecting anything on par with the GBA titles, the previous three DS titles, or Symphony of the Night. It's closer to Castlevania 1, 3, and Adventure with the style and story sensibilities of the 3D Castlevania games.  I have had more fun with Code of Princess, mainly because I like the music and the some-what mindless beat-em-up gameplay."

Simon's Quest is why I listed only 1,3, and Adventure and also said: ""that almost all of the games before it were more straightforward in terms of how they played.""  That said, Simon's Quest was a mess too, just like Mirror of Fate. There's a reason why there's a fan hack that ""fixes"" Castlevania 2."

3DS,3dwccm,95688it,2,Mon Jul 20 06:52:40 2015 UTC,I just started playing castlevania a couple days ago. It's really good and pretty hard.  It's a mix of castlevania 3 and SOTN.
3DS,3dwccm,CidImmacula,2,Mon Jul 20 03:48:16 2015 UTC,"so aside from the ""neither"" answers, let me go a bit more detail if you really must want to choose between the two.  I finished Mirror of Fate in less than 9hrs, at 85+% completion, and felt empty afterwards (usually in a Metroidvania, I would finish it at, at most, 79%...). The story is meh, the graphics is struggling, the gameplay is, at least, hard enough for a Castlevania ""lite"", but that's it.  I finished Code of Princess on one char in around 18hrs, felt satisfied with the jokes and the not-so-serious story, and overall had fun. But to do more than, uuh, 25% completion, I need to run the same story three more times...God even jokes get stale after just a second run, really. Replayability isn't pretty good.  If you really want to pick between the two, Code of Princess has more bang for your buck, even if it's not good bang for your buck, it's a lot better than Mirror of Fate.  But if you want some action game beat'em'up thingy....Get Senran Kagura Burst instead. (for side-scrolling platform, Azure Striker Gunvolt)"

3DS,3dwccm,CidImmacula,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:51:09 2015 UTC,"it can't really be even called an old-school styled Castlevania.  Metroidvania, the term, comes from, well, Castlevania and Metroid, both known as action platformers with a lot of hidden caches and items and stuff, and a really big ""map"". (like, big enough for me to get lost some times)  Mirror of Fate has, sadly, a single big map separated into ""three segments"", which isn't even a veritable maze every time. The action is there, the exploration is extremely trimmed down to near non-existence. (the segmentation really cuts down the map a lot, considering it's the same map on different ""times"")  Also, iirc, Mirror of Fate is a 3DS exclusive and cannot have an ""HD Version"" on steam. However, Mirror of Fate is a ""mini-sequel"" to the Castlevania re-boot, Lords of Shadow, which should be available to Steam (that or it's Lords of Shadow 2 that is on steam, thus, Mirror of Fate is a prequel to that. Mirror of Fate is set between Lords of Shadow 1 and Lords of Shadow 2). But of course, I could be wrong...I can't really double check at work cuz shit net.  Edit: 2lazy2delete"

3DS,3dwccm,CidImmacula,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:32 2015 UTC,"ano, it seems I was mistaken, on so many counts, considering I really haven't played ""Original"" Castlevania, or at least, I remember my first Castlevanias still a bit on exploration (I may be, perhaps, a bit too young).

Like I said though, Mirror of Fate could be better in the full game."

Dream Team is quite easily my least favorite of the M&L series, as it does a very poor job of concealing the fact that you're doing the same exact thing over and over again. The tutorializing stops at a certain point, but is certainly severe. I'd wait for Paper Jam personally. Assuming Intelligent Systems is assisting/co-developing with Alphadream, raise your expectations for that one. You're safe skipping Dream Team."
3DS,3du384,doctordonez,14,Sun Jul 19 14:19:51 2015 UTC,Thats such a shame. Maybe Ill just have to go back to Inside Story or even the original on my DS to satisfy this urge.
3DS,3du384,doctordonez,14,Sun Jul 19 14:24:09 2015 UTC,Superstar Saga's on Wii U I think. Was actually considering giving it a go as I haven't played it in a few years.

The whole game just feels slow. Dialogue pop up is slow with no ability to change it, the whole game just feels like you're playing ""my first rpg"". I could probably deal with this if the game gave you the ability to zone out and do other things during unimportant battles, but the fact that everything is rhythm based forces you to have to pay attention. The whole game forces you to play by it's dumbed down speed."

3DS,3du384,SuperLuigiWorld,10,Mon Jul 20 09:47:20 2015 UTC,I quit for this very reason. I have about 13 hours into it and it felt like the game was nothing but a tutorial. I've thought about going back but I haven't been so turned off by a game in a long time. It's really disappointing.   Edit: I've been thinking of playing this game again but I'm always on the fence. I just searched to see if other people hate the tutorials and I think this review's first paragraph sums it up nicely. http://www.usgamer.net/articles/marioluigi-dream-team-review  I may try it again anyways.

3DS,3du384,GoldenPersona,5,Sun Jul 19 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"Dream Team feels like Mario and Luigi wandered into someone else's crummy C-tier RPG. With its host of pointless characters that have nothing of value to say but still won't shut up, I'd say the C-tier RPG in question is Golden Sun.   Wow"

If they had made those characters and such their own IP then it might not have been so bad but considering how they say 'holy crap, there's a lot of messed up stuff going on' in the beginning, JUST to toss it all away within two hours and only bring it back up as the final scene in the game, I can't say it's worth a damn."
3DS,3du384,multiman000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:25:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Dark Dawn is definitely one of the more disappointing games I think I've ever played. I bought it day one of release, and it was soooo boring..."

3DS,3du384,ChezMere,5,Mon Jul 20 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is a common complaint about dream team. I loved it and none of these things bothered me, maybe it just isn't for you."
3DS,3du384,badgraphix,4,Sun Jul 19 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/lsy6iHN.jpg  Played the game recently out of Paper Jam hype. My biggest takeaway was that the battles are an enormous improvement over the reset of the series. The enemy patterns and boss battles have so much more to them than ever before, especially with the way the mechanics switch up in the dream world.  (Not counting the giant mode battles here, they're every bit as dull as they were in Bowser's Inside Story. Always a disappointment when one of them shows up instead of a proper boss battle.)"
3DS,3du384,jab011,2,Sun Jul 19 16:03:24 2015 UTC,Maybe if we're lucky Paper Jam will take the good elements of Dream Team but scrap what made it so much worse than the earlier ones.

Seems as though anyone who has played the prior entries tends to agree with you, though.  My biggest complaint was that the end game drags on terribly, and some of the giant boss battles are incredibly tedious.  They require you to follow a scripted pattern of attack that leaves no room for choice, and one error means you lose.  Overall though I liked it."

3DS,3du384,unknown724,2,Sun Jul 19 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"I had the same feeling. I went pretty far into the game assuming that the tutorial stuff would go away but as new concepts were added you were always introduced to a tutorial, I mean when a puzzle, a move etc was added you had to stop and watch them show you how it was down rather than let you do to learn. The hands holding really wore me enthusiasm out and the game was so pretty and had a novel concept. Really sucks that it got bogged down by these small things. When I complained about it earlier people were defending it saying it was in the past games. So I went back to see if it was true. What I noticed is that the games would put you in situations that let you figure out the concept. Unless it was like a new brother function the game let you learn by just progressing through the area that implemented the mechanic in that moment. It didn't feel like you were being thrown into a tutorial. I hope paper jam will fix those problems."

And really it isn't so much tutorial-ridden as it is story heavy.  If you can beat it though, there is a challenge mode where the enemies are much tougher and you can only carry up to ten of each item. If I had bought a card instead of downloading the game, I would offer to cartridges with you since I already have challenge mode unlocked."

3DS,3du384,Zionboy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:34:38 2015 UTC,"Heres my take on the series  Superstar Saga is in my top 5 favorite games ever, I fucking love that game. It's a near perfect RPG in my opinion, with a great story, funny and interesting characters, and accessible yet challenging gameplay.  Partners in Time was probably my least favorite of the series, I liked the darker story with the Shroobs attacking, but the sectioned off levels made it feel much smaller than the other games, and I wasnt a huge fan of the ""babies"" gameplay elements.   Bowsers Inside Story is the one game i have yet to play. To be honest the idea of playing half the game as bowser was kind of a turn off to me but Ive heard great things about the game and will likely try it soon.  And finally Deam Team. I pretty much agree with all of the criticisms, the game starts off painfully slow, there are too many tutorials and too much dialogue, and the game is overall pretty formulaic. Most of the game consists of go to new area, collect attack pieces, find dreampoint, collect attack pieces, fight boss, repeat untill finished. However, personally I find the core battling gameplay, enemy designs, and music to be some of the best in the series. I also love the art style, its one on the prettiest games on 3Ds imo. So yeah, overall Dream Team definitely has flaws but I think if you are willing to look past them there is still a great gameplay experience to be had."
3DS,3du384,brainfreeze91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:05:50 2015 UTC,"The game holds your hand up to the final dungeon with tutorial after tutorial that you can't skip and I'm not too thrilled with Paper Jam either. Yes, they let you skip tutorials but some look like they're unskippable. It also doesn't help that it's basically using the exact same model of gameplay as the previous two games. I dunno, something about bro ITEMS instead of MOVES just bugs the crap out of me, especially for the FOURTH time in the series."
